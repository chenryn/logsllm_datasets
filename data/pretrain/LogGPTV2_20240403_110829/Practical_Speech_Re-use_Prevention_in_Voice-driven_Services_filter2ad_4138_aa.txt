ABSTRACT
Voice-driven services (VDS) are being used in a variety of applica-
tions ranging from smart home control to payments using digital
assistants. The input to such services is often captured via an open
voice channel, e.g., using a microphone, in an unsupervised setting.
One of the key operational security requirements in such setting is
the freshness of the input speech. We present AEOLUS, a security
overlay that proactively embeds a dynamic acoustic nonce at the
time of user interaction, and detects the presence of the embedded
nonce in the recorded speech to ensure freshness. We demonstrate
that acoustic nonce can (i) be reliably embedded and retrieved,
and (ii) be non-disruptive (and even imperceptible) to a VDS user.
Optimal parameters (acoustic nonce’s operating frequency, ampli-
tude, and bitrate) are determined for (i) and (ii) from a practical
perspective. Experimental results show that AEOLUS yields 0.5%
FRR at 0% FAR for speech re-use prevention upto a distance of 4
meters in three real-world environments with different background
noise levels. We also conduct a user study with 120 participants,
which shows that the acoustic nonce does not degrade overall user
experience for 94.16% of speech samples, on average, in these en-
vironments. AEOLUS can therefore be used in practice to prevent
speech re-use and ensure the freshness of speech input.

Figure 1: Difference between re-use and generic speech replays. In
both cases, an adversary records a user’s interaction with a voice
driven service (VDS) “A”, over-the-air as shown in (a). In case of re-
use (b), the recorded interaction is used to attack the same type of
VDS A, while in case of replay (c), the interaction can be used to
attack the same or different type of VDS A’.
1 INTRODUCTION
Voice-driven services (VDS) are widely deployed in commercial
products to enable personalized and convenient experiences for
consumers. Examples include digital assistants from Amazon, Apple
and Google for performing tasks like smart home control, hands-
free online commerce, as well as automated voice response sys-
tems for customer support. While this increasing ubiquity can
be primarily attributed to improved real world performance of
deep learning driven speech and speaker recognition, security is an
equally important consideration in operational settings. To secure
VDS in practice, one of the common security mechanisms used is
“voice password”. For example, applications such as Samsung Bixby,
Wechat [13, 19, 20] prompt users to speak a password and perform
two factor authentication by checking (i) if the spoken passphrase
is correct, and (ii) it was spoken by the authorized user.
Voice passwords, however, do not provide security against voice
spoofing techniques such as speech replays [34, 43, 47] and synthe-
sis [3]. While there are known practical limitations in conducting
speech synthesis attacks (e.g., the attack proposed in [3] requires
24 hours of high quality training data), it is easier to record and
replay user speech in practice. In this work, we aim to address a
subset of malicious speech replays, called speech re-use attacks. We
define speech re-use attacks to be specific to a certain type of VDS.
As shown in Figure 1, let A and A’ be the VDS types for the capture
and attack steps, respectively. Speech replays typically consider a
variety of VDS types for capture and attack steps (A = A’ and A (cid:44)
A’), while re-use attacks are a subset of such replays where the VDS
types in consideration for the capture and attack steps is similar
(A = A’). An example of a re-use scenario is replaying a recorded

passphrase to fool the authentication process of an Amazon Alexa
service, and then conduct online shopping or controlling a smart
home device. A generic speech replay assumes this passphrase can
be used for other VDS which is not a practical assumption because
such passphrases are supposed to be VDS-specific or device-specific.
For example, reciting the phrase "Hey Siri" will not trigger an Ama-
zon Alexa service.
Existing defense mechanisms can be categorized into two classes.
The first class of methods use machine learning to determine whether
a speech sample is produced by a human or replayed using a play-
back device [26, 57]. The second category of techniques use external
devices (e.g., a vibration sensor) to check if the speech is produced
by a human in real-time [32]. For machine learning techniques, real
world performance usually depends on training data and its rele-
vance to the test environment. A state-of-the-art method Void [22],
as an example, has significantly different equal error rates (EER),
0.3% and 11.6%, on two speech datasets collected in two different
environments. Another practical limitation is unreliability of play-
back device signatures used by machine learning techniques [57].
In addition, for methods that use extra hardware, there are usability
and cost implications for practical deployment.
We present AEOLUS1, a security overlay to prevent re-use attacks
on protected VDS in a proactive and device-agnostic manner. The
proposed security overlay proactively embeds a dynamic acoustic
nonce in the voice channel via the loudspeaker at the time of user
interaction, and detects the presence of the embedded nonce in the
speech recorded by the speaker to ensure speech freshness. For
example, if the security overlay is integrated with each Alexa’s
VDS, it can prevent speech captured from user interaction with
one Alexa’s VDS from being re-used on another Alexa’s VDS. This
is similar to the device specific random pattern used in Face ID
to counter digital and physical spoofs [5] (see Figure 2). AEOLUS is
designed as a software solution, and can be integrated by a vendor
with any closed-loop VDS that involves real-time user interaction.
It is useful for providing additional security in critical applications
such as user authentication and payments. AEOLUS does not require
any extra hardware and works with in-built speaker and micro-
phone in consumer products. AEOLUS is secure by design against
attacks that remove the embedded nonce for speech re-use. It uses
Frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) [29] [30] technique
for dynamic acoustic nonce embedding. Similar techniques have
been previously used to watermark audio recordings for copyright
purposes [53] [23]. However, their application in offline audio wa-
termarking is fundamentally different from VDS operational setting
where the length and content of the input speech is unknown apri-
ori. AEOLUS is designed for real-time over-the-air use without prior
knowledge of the input speech.
AEOLUS addresses two key practical challenges. The first chal-
lenge is to reliably embed an acoustic nonce over-the-air and re-
trieve it successfully from the recorded speech. Over-the-air acous-
tic nonce propagation is affected by factors such as background
noise and distance between microphone and loudspeaker [27]. The
latter, for instance, results in distorted and attenuated speech signal
which increases the likelihood of errors while extracting the embed-
ded acoustic nonce. The second challenge is to embed the acoustic

nonce such that it is imperceptible to a VDS user. Achieving imper-
ceptibility is non-trivial in light of the first challenge. This is because
an important consideration for reliability is embedding acoustic
nonce of certain strength which, in turn, makes the acoustic nonce
perceptible. Therefore, we model acoustic nonce generation as an
optimization problem and compute the set of optimal parameters,
e.g., nonce’s operating frequency, amplitude, bitrate in different
environments using differential evolution.
We evaluate AEOLUS in three different environments and show
that it works reliably upto a range of 4 m. Additionally, we conduct
a user study involving 120 subjects (approved by the institutional
review board, or IRB) to evaluate the imperceptibility of the em-
bedded nonce. The results of the study show that majority of users
find the embedded acoustic nonce to be either imperceptible or
non-disruptive.
In summary, the contributions of this work are as follows:
• Design of a VDS security overlay called AEOLUS to ensure
freshness of input speech without any extra hardware de-
pendency.
• Modeling acoustic nonce propagation as an optimization
problem to address i) reliability, i.e. ensuring successful em-
bedding and retrieval of dynamic acoustic nonce without
impacting VDS functionality, and (ii) imperceptibility, i.e. to
have minimal impact on VDS users’ experience.
• Comprehensive real-world evaluation to show that AEOLUS
can work effectively (0.5% false reject rate (FRR) and 0% false
accept rate (FAR) in detecting speech re-use) up to a range
of 4 meters in three different environments.
• User study with 120 subjects to demonstrate that the embed-
ded acoustic nonce does not degrade user experience.
2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
In this section, we first outline typical VDS workflow for the col-
lection and processing of a user’s voice. Next, we discuss key mo-
tivating examples to underscore the need for designing AEOLUS.
Following this, we review related work for speech re-use preven-
tion and related audio watermarking methods.
2.1 Voice-driven Services (VDS)
VDS are becoming increasingly popular for conducting a variety of
tasks ranging from internet browsing to online commerce. In fact,
it is predicted that by the end of 2020, 50% of all searches performed
online will be driven by voice [7]. VDS are widely used in both

smartphone and Internet of Things (IoT) platforms. Major smart-
phone vendors (e.g., Apple and Samsung) provide native support
for VDS, e.g. Amazon’s Alexa or Apple’s Siri, in their operating sys-
tems, and make them available as independent applications. These
can be used to instruct third-party applications to perform specific
tasks, e.g., to turn lights on/off.
Chen et al. [26] present a method that obtains 0% EER for distance
(between user and VDS input device) of only a few centimeters
which limits its applicability in practice. Ahmed et al. [22]’s method,
on the other hand, is reported to work well upto a distance of 2.6
meters. However, the EER varies significantly in different environ-
ments with it being as low as 11.6%. One of the best performing
methods [38] reports EER of 6.7% on ASVSpoof 17 database. A
caveat, however, is that these methods aim to address general re-
play attacks. In contrast, AEOLUS aims to prevent speech re-use
and obtains 0% EER upto a distance of 4 meters in three different
environments.
The second category of approaches use additional hardware
(e.g., a vibration sensor on user’s neck) to check that speech is
produced in real-time by a user [32] [47]. Such approaches, in
general, outperform machine learning-based methods. For example,
Feng et al. [32] report 97% successful detection rate, on average,
with no strict assumption on distance. However, there are two
major practical limitations using the aforementioned approaches
for detecting speech re-use, (i) requirement of extra hardware which
has cost implications, and (ii) inconvenience to users. AEOLUS only
uses the built-in loudspeaker and microphone in smart devices yet
achieves high speech re-use detection rate.
Audio Watermarking. Audio watermarking is widely used for
multimedia copyright protection [49, 53]. Both time domain [23]
and frequency domain [28, 44] watermarking techniques have been
proposed in the literature. Typically, audio watermark embedding
and detection is self-synchronized [59]. Advanced watermarking
methods use spread-spectrum modulation [53] to prevent water-
mark removal and provide imperceptibility [28, 39]. While useful,
these techniques cannot be directly used in VDS operational setting.
They are designed for fixed length offline audio files, e.g., music
recordings in CDs [53], and do not consider the impact of envi-
ronmental factors, e.g., bitrate variability and background noise, in
over-the-air transmission. Such environmental factors result in a
dynamic and lossy acoustic environment in turn making watermark
embedding and retrieval significantly challenging. Further, they
are not designed for real-time speech and speaker recognition sys-
tems where input speech is unknown apriori and can be of variable
length. AEOLUS is designed to take these pragmatic considerations
into account. It is able to successfully embed and retrieve acoustic
nonce in the voice channel without degrading user experience in
practice.
3 PROPOSED SECURITY OVERLAY
In this section, we present the AEOLUS design by first introducing
its threat model including both adversary capability and hardware
assumptions. Next, as shown in Figure 3, we illustrate the core
design of AEOLUS which consists of VDS-compatible acoustic nonce
generation, embedding, and detection.
3.1 Threat Model
At the time of user interaction, the method used to trigger a VDS,
e.g., words or phrases like “Alexa” and “Hey, Siri” are not protected
but can initiate the proposed overlay to prevent re-use of voice
