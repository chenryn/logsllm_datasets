## Abstract
DNS packets are designed to travel in unencrypted form through the Internet based on its initial standard. Recent discoveries show that real-world adversaries are actively exploiting this design vulnerability to compromise Internet users' security and privacy. To mitigate such threats, several protocols have been proposed to encrypt DNS queries between DNS clients and servers, collectively referred to as DNS-over-Encryption. While some proposals have been standardized and are gaining strong support from the industry, little has been done to understand their status from the perspective of global users.

This paper presents the first end-to-end and large-scale analysis of DNS-over-Encryption. By collecting data from Internet scanning, user-end measurements, and passive monitoring logs, we have gained several unique insights. In general, the service quality of DNS-over-Encryption is satisfactory in terms of accessibility and latency. For DNS clients, DNS-over-Encryption queries are less likely to be disrupted by in-path interception compared to traditional DNS, and the extra overhead is tolerable. However, we also discovered several issues regarding how the services are operated. For example, 25% of DNS-over-TLS service providers use invalid SSL certificates. Compared to traditional DNS, DNS-over-Encryption is used by far fewer users, but we have witnessed a growing trend. Therefore, we believe the community should push broader adoption of DNS-over-Encryption and suggest that service providers carefully review their implementations.

## 1 Introduction
The Domain Name System (DNS) is one of the fundamental building blocks of the Internet, mapping user-friendly domain names to numerical IP addresses. According to its initial IETF standard, DNS packets are transmitted over UDP protocol in clear text, lacking communication integrity and confidentiality. This design makes DNS communications vulnerable to attacks like eavesdropping and tampering [29]. Real-world adversaries, such as the NSA, have exploited DNS to monitor and hijack traffic under projects like MoreCowBell [44] and QuantumDNS [12]. A recent study also shows that network middleboxes are actively intercepting DNS packets and rerouting them to alternative resolvers [60].

One of the mainstream approaches to mitigating such threats is to encrypt DNS communications. Various techniques have been proposed, including DNS-over-TLS (DoT), DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH), DNS-over-QUIC, and DNSCrypt, collectively termed as DNS-over-Encryption (DoE). Although most of these protocols have only been established for a few years, some have gained strong support from large DNS service providers [2, 4, 14], operating systems [24, 56], and software [6, 38, 63].

Despite the industry's efforts, little has been done to understand the operational status of DNS-over-Encryption from the perspective of Internet users. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive and end-to-end review of DNS-over-Encryption, which will guide future adoption and ecosystem improvement. The research questions we seek to answer include:
1. How many providers are offering DNS-over-Encryption services, and are their implementations secure?
2. What does their performance look like for globally distributed users, and are there any issues preventing access or causing errors?
3. What does the real-world usage of DNS-over-Encryption look like?

### Our Study
So far, DNS-over-TLS (DoT) and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) are two standardized and extensively supported protocols to secure traditional DNS. Our study focuses on measuring these two protocols. First, we perform a comparative study on DNS-over-Encryption protocols to outline their strengths and weaknesses (Section 2). Second, we launch Internet-wide scanning to discover DNS-over-Encryption service providers and analyze their security issues (Section 3). Third, we assess the accessibility and performance of DNS-over-Encryption services by recruiting geographically distributed vantage points (Section 4). Accessing real-world DNS-over-Encryption traffic from massive vantage points without violating participants’ privacy is challenging. We address this challenge by running controlled experiments on a carefully designed Internet measurement platform. Finally, we compare the traffic volume between traditional DNS requests and DNS-over-Encryption requests using several large-scale datasets, including passive DNS datasets and 18-month NetFlow data from a large ISP (Section 5).

### Findings
We have obtained some unique discoveries about the deployment of DNS-over-Encryption. On one hand, the service quality of DNS-over-Encryption providers is generally satisfactory, suggesting the industry is prepared for large-scale real-world usage. On the other hand, we have identified misconfigurations in some services, indicating that more efforts should be made to ensure correct adoption. Below, we highlight the key findings:

- We discovered over 150 DoT and 17 DoH providers offering DNS-over-Encryption services with over 1.5K addresses. Many of these do not appear in public resolver lists. However, 25% of DoT providers, including large ones like Perfect Privacy, use invalid SSL certificates, which can break the server authentication process. Additionally, TLS inspection devices act as DoT proxies, and Quad9 DoH has a misconfiguration causing DNS lookup errors, which we reported to the provider.
- Compared to traditional DNS, the reachability of DNS-over-Encryption servers is better, with less than 1% of global clients experiencing service disruption. However, some DNS-over-Encryption services are still disrupted by censorship (e.g., Google DoH blocked in China) and TLS interception, which diminishes the benefits of encrypted DNS queries.
- The extra overhead incurred by DNS-over-Encryption is tolerable to global users. On average, transmitting encrypted DNS queries adds several milliseconds of extra query latency compared to traditional DNS.
- The traffic volume and active users of encrypted DNS are still at a small scale compared to traditional DNS. However, the usage of DNS-over-Encryption services has been growing in recent months. For example, Cloudflare DoT witnessed a 56% traffic increase from July 2018 to December 2018.

### The “Early” View of Ecosystem
This paper presents the first systematic and large-scale study on the ecosystem of DNS-over-Encryption since its proposal. While it may seem that the ecosystem is small because major users still choose clear-text DNS, the first DNS-over-Encryption protocol has been established for around 10 years, and many resolvers, including Google and Cloudflare, have started running DNS-over-Encryption services. It is necessary to understand the gap between deployment and user adoption and identify the successes and pitfalls of different protocols. Such efforts can help the community adjust the roadmap for the better future of DNS-over-Encryption. To this end, we publish our collected data and results to aid further studies and will continue to monitor the ecosystem.

### Contributions

- **Dataset Release:** We continuously collect data and measure the development of DNS-over-Encryption. Our datasets are available for public use at https://dnsencryption.info.

## 2 Background
In this section, we first describe the privacy considerations regarding DNS. We then elaborate and perform a comparative study on current protocols to encrypt DNS communications.

### 2.1 DNS Privacy Considerations
DNS precedes almost all Internet activities: email senders look up recipients' server addresses; patients query hospital domain names; devices use DNS to discover each other. By design, DNS packets are sent in clear text, making them vulnerable to both passive (e.g., on-path eavesdroppers) and active attackers (e.g., rogue DNS servers).

The unencrypted design of DNS exposes Internet users to privacy threats. DNS traffic can be used to fingerprint client machines and analyze user behavior [32, 48, 54, 55]. Previous works have shown that client machines can be tracked across the Internet by analyzing passive DNS data [52]. Documents reveal that massive DNS surveillance exists on the Internet, such as NSA’s QuantumDNS and MoreCowBell projects [12, 44]. In short, unprotected DNS traffic can introduce significant privacy risks to Internet users.

### 2.2 DNS-over-Encryption Protocols
Driven by these concerns, the community has devoted significant efforts to mitigating DNS privacy issues. As shown in Figure 1, the earliest proposal to protect DNS communications dates back to 2009. Since 2014, the IETF has established two Working Groups, and various protocols have been proposed to secure traditional DNS. These techniques have gained support from large industrial providers, including Mozilla [62] and Google [4]. It is unsurprising that clear-text DNS will be replaced by secured formats, similar to HTTPS being mandated for high-profile websites (e.g., banking sites).

Adding confidentiality and authentication properties to the DNS protocol is an effective approach to addressing DNS privacy threats. In this work, we focus on techniques dedicated to securing the stub-to-recursive link of DNS resolutions, as it is the primary focus of the community and most proposals [45, 49, 50]. Below, we provide an overview and perform a comparative study on different DNS-over-Encryption protocols.

#### Evaluation Criteria
We consider 10 criteria under 5 categories to evaluate different DNS-over-Encryption protocols:

- **Protocol Design:**
  1. Whether the new protocol is based on traditional DNS or switches to a different application-layer protocol.
  2. Whether it provides a fallback option when certain cryptographic operations cannot be applied (i.e., back to non-authenticated or clear-text connections).
- **Security:**
  1. Whether the protocol is based on standard cryptographic protocols (e.g., TLS).
  2. Whether it can defend against on-path passive DNS traffic analysis (or at least offers options against it).
- **Usability:**
  1. Changes that client users need to make before using the protocol: no extra software needed (low), extra software installation or configuration needed (medium), or no supporting software yet (high).
  2. Whether the protocol incurs query overhead over traditional DNS-over-UDP (e.g., by using TCP or requiring TLS handshake) or provides options to amortize it.
- **Deployability:**
  1. Whether the protocol is designed over standardized and well-supported protocols.
  2. Whether it is supported by mainstream DNS software (e.g., BIND [34], Knot Resolver [6], and Unbound [21], see Appendix A).
- **Maturity:**
  1. Whether the protocol is currently standardized by the IETF.
  2. Whether it is extensively supported by DNS service providers (e.g., large public DNS resolvers, see Appendix A).

Currently, five major DNS-over-Encryption protocols are proposed to secure the stub-to-recursive link, including DNS-over-TLS (DoT), DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH), DNS-over-DTLS, DNS-over-QUIC, and DNSCrypt. Using the criteria above, we present their evaluation in Table 1. Each protocol is categorized as "satisfying" (denoted as ✅), "partially satisfying" (denoted as ⚠️), or "not satisfying" one criterion (denoted as ❌). Below, we elaborate on each protocol in detail.

#### DNS-over-TLS (DoT)
DoT is standardized by RFC7858 [49] in 2016. Its concept is straightforward: clients and servers negotiate a Transport Layer Security (TLS) session before DNS lookups, and use it to wrap wire-format DNS queries transported through TCP. This allows clients and recursive resolvers to exchange encrypted DNS messages (preventing passive monitoring) and resolvers to be authenticated by verifying SSL certificates (preventing man-in-the-middle attacks). By default, DoT uses port 853 for communication. The use of a dedicated port could make DoT requests distinguishable from other traffic, but padding options (e.g., EDNS(0) padding [61]) can be leveraged to reduce adversaries' capability of traffic analysis.

To provide different levels of security and privacy protections, DoT is designed with two usage profiles for DNS clients: the Strict Privacy profile and the Opportunistic Privacy profile [69], and provides fallback mechanisms. Under the Strict Privacy profile, a DNS client is required to both authenticate the DoT server and encrypt transactions. If either requirement is not met, the DoT query will fail. By contrast, clients using the Opportunistic Privacy profile attempt for the best protection and may fallback to a non-authenticated connection or even a clear-text connection.

Regarding implementation, as shown in Appendix A, DoT has been extensively supported by operating systems (e.g., Android 9 [56]), DNS software (e.g., Unbound [21] and Stubby [38]), and large public DNS resolvers (e.g., Cloudflare [2], Google [4], and Quad9 [14]). For service providers, current implementations reduce the cost of operating a DoT resolver, and SSL certificates are easy to install with automated CAs like Let’s Encrypt [8]. However, before a client uses DoT, extra software or configuration may be required.
