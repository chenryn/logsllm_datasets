die  area  overhead.  Moreover,  error  correction  can  cause  extra 
latency during the decode stage. The reduced error rate achieved 
by  our  proposed  techniques  can  minimize  the  latency  of  error 
correction  during  the  decode  stage.  The  lower  error  rate  also 
allows  fewer  check  bits  to  be  used,  thereby  minimizing  the  die 
area overhead of ECC. To obtain the runtime temperature profile, 
we  used  the  temperature  modeling  tool  Hotspot  4.0  [25]  to 
dynamically  calculate  the  temperature  distribution  across  the 
PCM 
the  power 
consumption  for  each  functional  block  as  input  and  generates 
accurate temperature estimation for each block. The floorplan of 
the core layer and the PCM layer is similar to the one shown in 
Figure  7.  The  power  trace  input  to  Hotspot  is  generated  using 
Wattch  and  DRAMSim  power  models.  To  implement  the  OS 
page  migration  and  allocation  scheme,  we  modified  the  custom 
memory  manager  in  PTLSim.  The  associated  performance  and 
power  overhead  have  been  taken  into  account  in  our  reported 
simulation results.

VI. EVALUATION  
Efficiency of Drifting Tolerance 
Figure 8 shows the readout reliability benefit of the proposed 
drift-tolerant  techniques.  “InvRot”  represents  the  MLC-PCM 
implementation  that  utilizes  the  data  inversion  and  rotation  to 
tolerate  drifting.  “InvRot+Hyb”  is  the  design  that  combines  the 
data  inversion  and  rotation  with  the  hybrid  SLC/MLC  design. 
The  last  bar,  “InvRot+Hyb+PageAlloc”  represents  the  case  in 
which all of the proposed techniques are applied simultaneously.

205As shown in Figure 8, the average of the absolute read error rate 
decreases  significantly  from  5.1%  to  less  than  0.05%  for  the 
“None”  case  when  the  margin  is  enlarged  from  0uA  to  2.0uA. 
Nonetheless,  such  wide  margin  designs  improve  the  readout 
reliability  at  the  cost  of  2.3X  power  overhead  and  100X 
endurance degradation (detailed in Section VI.B). For the design 
with  a  0uA  margin  size,  the  “None”  design  incurs  an  absolute 
error rate of 11.3% on average across High-error-rate workloads 
(i.e. H1, H2, H3), while this absolute error rate can be reduced by 
3%, or relatively 30%, through data inversion and rotation. This 
error rate reduction is the result of the reduced number of drift-
sensitive  states  (i.e.  “01”  and  “10”)  stored  in  memory  cells. 
Figure  9  shows  the  percentage  of  cells  that  stores  “01”  or  “10” 
during  read  references  before  and  after  applying  data  inversion 
and rotation. We observe that the number of “01” and “10” states 
is reduced by a relative 32% and 3% respectively after applying 
inversion  and  rotation  and  the  total  number  of  drift-sensitive 
states is decreased by a relative 20%. Note that the reduction in 
“01”  is  significantly  higher  than  that  of  the  “10”  state.  This  is 
because data inversion and rotation may convert the highly-drift-
sensitive  state  “01”  to  the  less-drift-sensitive  state  “10”.  Across 
all simulated workloads, H3 has the largest reduction, a relative 
62.6%, in the total number of drift-sensitive states and this leads 
to an absolute 5.7%, or relative 61%, decrease in the error rate for 
0uA margin size in Figure 8. When the SLC/MLC hybrid design 
is employed, the “InvRot+Hyb” scheme further reduces the error 
rate  by  absolute  1.4%,  or  relative  48.5%,  with  respective  to  the 
“InvRot” case. This is because the pages that exhibit long read-to-
write  memory  reference  characteristics  are  switched  from  the 
MLC mode to the SLC mode, thereby eliminating further readout 
errors  after  mode  switching.  Figure  10  shows  the  percentage  of 
pages  that  operate  in  SLC  mode.  An  average  of  4.1%  of  total 
pages  performed  a  mode  switch  and  this  leads  to  a  small  2.1% 
memory  capacity  overhead  caused  by  the  hybrid  design.  By 
combining 
together, 
“InvRot+Hyb+PageAlloc”  reduces  the  absolute  error  rate  from 
4.2%  to  1.2%,  a  relative  decrease  of  69.3%.  Across  all  of  the 
investigated  margins,  the  “InvRot+Hyb+PageAlloc”  achieves  an 
average of 87% error rate reduction over the “None” case.
