The distance between numerical features is expressed as the
Euclidian distance of the values. To account for differences in range,
the numeric features are first normalized using a min-max-scaler
across the entire dataset of malicious registrations before their
distances are calculated.
Categorical features have a limited set of possible values. The
similarity distance of categorical features is therefore expressed by
equality (0 or 1). As name server geolocations can have multiple
values, the similarity distance for these is expressed as the fraction
of values that are shared between the two instances.
Pairwise distance metric. The pairwise feature distance of two
registrations i and j is expressed as fij. The total pairwise distance
between the two registrations is a weighted sum of the pairwise
feature distances.

Information gain-based weights. We aim to make the distance
metric resilient to changing adversary tactics by enabling autonomous
feature re-weighting. To define the relative importance of the vari-
ous features in the pairwise distance, we calculate the information
gain of each individual feature via multi-interval discretization [4].
The information gain expresses to what extent a feature can parti-
tion the registrations in benign and malicious registrations.
To calculate the information gain, pairwise distances need to
be calculated (1) between malicious registrations and (2) between
malicious and benign registrations.
Figure 4 plots the daily information gain of the features during
the validation phase. Clearly, the registrant features (in green) and
the name server domains (in blue) are the most prominent.
Although the absolute feature weights vary on a day-by-day
basis in Figure 4, their relative importance is quite stable over time.
Therefore, the clustering weights could be reused for multiple days,
as further discussed in Section 6.2.
4.2 Clustering algorithm
We opt for Agglomerative Clustering, given its ability to work with
custom pairwise distances. Agglomerative clustering belongs to the
family of hierarchical clustering algorithms and works by iteratively
merging two clusters that are the closest to each other [11].
In order to merge the most similar clusters, the algorithm must
be able to determine the distance between clusters. For this purpose,
we adopt the complete linkage criterion. Using this criterion, the
distance between two clusters is equal to that of the most dissimilar
instances of both clusters, promoting a high intra-cluster similarity.
Distance matrix. The distance matrix DM is a symmetric n × n
matrix, where n is the number of malicious registrations in the train-
ing set, and is constructed from the custom pairwise distances dij.
This distance matrix DM serves as the input for the agglomerative
clustering algorithm.

Clustering distance threshold. To partition into disjoint clusters,
a stop criterion needs to be provided to the hierarchical cluster-
ing algorithm. As a cutting point, we supply a maximum distance
threshold. Clusters are then merged until the maximum distance is
reached. Similarly, this distance threshold is used to assess whether
or not a new registration belongs to an existing cluster of malicious
registrations.
To determine an optimal value for this clustering threshold, we
plot the distribution of the smallest pairwise distance found to any

malicious registration, for both the malicious and benign domains
in the training set (Figure 6).
As expected, malicious registrations are in general really similar
to another malicious registration (a consequence of the campaign
ecosystem). In contrast, the very vast majority of benign registra-
tions are substantially dissimilar from malicious registrations. As
such, we can express the clustering distance threshold as a value
between the average of the malicious and benign minimal pair-
