User: There is a cloud-based database system that needs to be scaled horizontally. Please analyze the problems existing in the existing database and provide a suitable expansion plan.
Assistant: Problems: 1. The storage and processing capabilities of a single server are limited and cannot meet high concurrent query requests; 2. There is a bottleneck in the database, which makes it difficult to support the storage and processing of large amounts of data; 3. It can only be expanded vertically to increase the storage and processing of the server The processing capacity cannot quickly adapt to changes in business scale; 4. The high availability and fault tolerance of the database are limited. Once the server fails, the data will be lost or inaccessible. Solution: 1. Use a distributed architecture to distribute data storage and processing to multiple servers, and achieve high concurrent query requests through load balancing; 2. Use a distributed file system to store data dispersedly on multiple servers. Improve storage and processing capabilities; 3. Adopt an automatic expansion scheme, automatically increase or decrease the number of servers according to the data volume and load conditions, and quickly adapt to changes in business scale; 4. Use data replication and backup technology to back up data to multiple on each server to ensure high availability and fault tolerance of data. At the same time, using failover technology, once a server fails, the business will be automatically transferred to other servers to avoid data loss and inaccessibility.
