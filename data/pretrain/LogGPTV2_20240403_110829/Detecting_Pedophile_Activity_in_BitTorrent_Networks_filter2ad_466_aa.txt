Abstract. The wide spread of Peer-to-Peer networks makes multime-
dia ﬁles available to users all around the world. However, Peer-to-Peer
networks are often used to spread illegal material, while keeping the
source of the data and the acquiring users anonymous. In this paper we
analyze activity measurements in the BitTorrent network and examine
child sex abuse activity through the Mininova web portal. We detect and
characterize pedophilic material in the network, and also analyze diﬀer-
ent aspects of the abusers activity. We hope our results will help law
enforcement teams detecting child molesters and tracking them down
earlier.

Introduction
Peer-to-peer networks are being widely used around the world by millions of
users for sharing content. The anonymity provided by these networks makes
them prone to sharing illegal contents, from simple copyright protected material
to highly dangerous material, as will be discussed next.
The BitTorrent ﬁle sharing network was responsible for 27% to 55% of internet
traﬃc (depending on geographic location) in 2009 [13]. The BitTorrent protocol
allows to download large ﬁles without loading a single source computer, rather
the downloading users join a group of hosts that download and upload from each
other, simultaneously. Every BitTorrent ﬁle is uniquely deﬁned by a descriptor
ﬁle called a torrent, which is distributed via email or http websites. This torrent
ﬁle allows the downloading and uploading users, called leechers and seeders, to
share the content ﬁle.
Pornography is one of the major content consumption area in the Internet. In
2006, over $2.84 billion were spent in the United States alone on Internet pornog-
raphy, with 4.2 million websites dedicated for this purpose alone, accounting for
12% of all websites at that time [14]. Child pornography is a subset of this ac-
tivity, earning over three billion dollars a year (including non-online activity as
well), with over 100K websites oﬀering child pornography and with over 116K
daily queries in Gnutella network for ”child pornography” [14,15].
Many works try to ﬁght Internet child sex abuse. The most common approach
is CBIR, Content Based Image and video Retrieval, which tries to detect and
retrieve visual ﬁles based on previously studied characteristics from similar ﬁles.
The retrieval techniques have been thoroughly studied in many works, such as
N. Taft and F. Ricciato (Eds.): PAM 2012, LNCS 7192, pp. 106–115, 2012.

[10]. Chopra et al. [2] have tried to address the problem at the network level.
They suggested adapting classiﬁcation techniques to allow network infrastruc-
ture, such as routers, to detect illegal ﬁle transfer. Projects, such as FIVES
[3], combine eﬀorts on multiple domains, from eﬃcient ﬁle fragment matching,
through means to evaluate large amounts of data, to improved capabilities of
linking new illegal multimedia material to old one. For video analysis they use
not only image features but also motion information [7]. Research related to
child sex abuse in P2P networks is scarce,with few exceptions such as MAPAP
[11], which focuses on the eDonkey network, or Huges et al. [5], studying the
Gnutella network. Liberatore et al. [9] discussed legal issues involved in inves-
tigating child pornography in the Gnutella and BitTorrent networks. They also
developed Roundup, used by Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task
Forces to detect child sex abusers in the Gnutella network, given a list of known
child pornography ﬁles.
In this paper we present a study of child sex abuse activity in the BitTor-
rent network, examining behavioral patterns in both queries and downloads.
The results presented in this paper may be employed by law enforcement forces
to detect and track pedophiles in the BitTorrent network, e.g. using the given
analysis new illicit ﬁles can be detected.
2 MiniNova Data Set
The Mininova website [12] was for a long time a very popular BitTorrent portal,
until a court order forced it to remove all copyrighted torrents at the end of 2009.
According to Alexa [1] at the end of 2009 the site was ranked 90 of all world-
wide websites, with 1.07% of all internet users visiting it, and ﬁrst of all torrent
websites, ahead of portals such as The Pirate Bay (ranked 105),Torrentz.com
(ranked 190) and isoHunt (ranked 196). The average visitor to the website is
a young male without children, age 18 to 34, browsing from home and staying
in the website for 4.3 minutes (based on [1]). Torrents on the website can be
found by browsing, or more frequently by searching the website. The torrents
are located under categories and subcategories on the website, with over 950
subcategories. A new torrent uploaded to the website is placed under a subcate-
gory selected by the originator; the website moderators rarely change a torrent’s
location.
The dataset used in this work was obtained from the Mininova website1, and
covers two time periods in 2009: the ﬁrst from September 2nd to September
25th, and the second from October 15th to December 7th; a total of 67 days.
The dataset was anonymized before it was provided to us, with the users IP
addresses removed from the dataset. The dataset is comprised of queries and
downloads.
– Queries: The query dataset holds 453 million queries. A query registry con-
tains the query text, a timestamp, and its city of origin.

– Downloads: The downloads dataset holds 515 million torrent downloads,
with over 1.3 million distinct torrents. A download entry contains the tor-
rent’s name, torrent’s subcategory, ﬁle size, a timestamp, and the city of the
user.
The most popular subcategories (by downloads) on the Mininova website are
action and comedy movies, games for Windows, TV shows (miscellaneous) and
ebooks. Pornography is not very common in the Mininova website and there is
no subcategory dedicated for such torrents. Adult material is often placed under
diﬀerent subcategories, such as ”Asian” or ”Movies - Other”.
2.1 Data Set Limitations
The Mininova data set analysis has several limitations. First of all, this data
set covers only one Torrents website. While it can be argued that this site was
clearly the leading Torrents site[1] at the sample time, it might not be represen-
tative of child sex activity in the entire BitTorrent network. Another diﬃculty is
users anonymity, with only user’s city available. This means that the activity of
a speciﬁc user can not be pinpointed, e.g. there is no clear distinction between
users and activity sessions. The downloads database also lacks metadata infor-
mation, making it diﬃcult to classify the ﬁle and correlate between queries and
downloads. Last, there is no ground truth database for child sex abuse that can
be referenced. We believe that basing our dictionary assumptions on previous
work (See Section 1) that corroborate researchers from multiple ﬁelds, including
social sciences, provide an adequate baseline for our analysis.
3 Results
3.1 General Statistics
We divide the queries and downloads in the database to six groups: movies, mu-
sic, pictures, applications, documents, and unknown. The distinction is based
on keywords for queries, and keywords and torrent category for downloads. Dis-
carding queries and downloads of an unknown type, most of the downloads from
Mininova, over 80%, are of movies. Next are music ﬁles (about 14%) and pictures
(3%). Considering general queries, 53% are for movies, 21% for programs, 14.4%
music and 8.5% pictures. Looking at pedophile material, the queries for them
divide approximately two thirds movies and one third pictures. The amount of
detected distinct pedophile ﬁles in the database is too small to set a baseline for
pedophile downloads statistics.
3.2 Collected Queries Statistics
Keywords Ranking. To identify pedophile related material, a dictionary of
related words is created. The dictionary relies on previous works in this area
[17,8] as well as popular online sources [16]2. The dictionary of pedophile-related

words that was used for this study includes 47 words. Each of these words on
its own has a pedophilic meaning, but in context may become innocent. For
example, ”Lolita” on its own versus the combination of ”Lolita” and ”Nabokov”,
which refers to the known novel. In all our results, we apply a ﬁlter to all such
known combinations, which add up to over 40 combinations. We note that the
created dictionary may not be full, but we show that these words alone are
enough to portray a worrying picture.
Table 1 presents the top-10 most used terms in pedophilic queries. The table con-
tains for each word, the number of occurrences, percentage out of pedophilic queries,
and percentage out of total number of queries. The words ”lolita” and ”incest” are
the most popular terms used. We recognize that these two words may also relate to
non-pedophilic contexts, but claim that at least some of these queries are still re-
lated, as we show in the next section. We see that about 50% of all queries are the top
2 words, which we suspect not to be completely ﬁltered, still only four or ﬁve more
words are dominant in the queries. It is also observed that these words appear in one
of every 25K to 100K queries out of all queries, which is considered high.
We compare these results with Gish et al.[4] which looked at popular queries
in the Gnutella network. The term ”PTHC” ranked ﬁfth in their most popular
constant phrases, appearing in approximately 0.1% of all queries, while the term
incest ranked tenth, appearing in 0.05% of all queries. In the Mininova database
these two terms are not as frequent as in Gnutella, however the use of Gnutella
and Mininova by users is not identical; While in the Gnutella network the most
popular queries are pornographic or music related [4] in Mininova the popu-
lar categories are movies and applications. The same observation also applies
when comparing the results to MAPAP’s eDonkey based research [11]: the term
”PTHC” is ranked ﬁrst, with the second term being ”Pedo”, both searched con-
siderably more than any other term. Other popular terms in BitTorrent, such
as ”Lolita”, are less popular in eDonkey, while terms such as ”Preteen” and
”Underage” are not ranked at all.
The most frequent queries are also compared with isoHunt’s top searches list
[6]3. isoHunt’s list does not provide information about the number of queries

per term, rather it ranks them by their popularity. In addition, isoHunt provides
diﬀerent ranking for ﬁltered and unﬁltered terms, with all pedophilic terms, ex-
cept ”lolita”, being ﬁltered out. Compared to the Mininova top-10 list, the term
”PTHC” is ranked highest (83), followed by ”Preteen”(119), ”Lolita”(135), ”In-
cest”(143), ”Pedo”(257), ”12yo”(275), ”Underage”(284), and ”Hussyfan”(955).
The terms ”R@ygold” and ”Yamad” are not amongst the top 1000 searches.
We see an additional diﬀerence from our top-ranked list, as terms such as ”7yo”,
which was not amongst our top-30 queries, being placed high in the global search
list (290), and with the term ”9yo” being ranked higher(274) than ”12yo”.
Another aspect that should be considered here is the time that passed between
datasets collections: two years between the Gnutella and eDonkey collection to
the Mininova dataset, and two additional years from Mininova to isoHunt.Over
this time, the awareness to P2P networks usage for ill purposes has grown, thus
users ”vocabulary” has widened and altered in order to avoid tracking.
Correlation Between Keywords. Queries identiﬁed as pedophile-related of-
ten include more than a single term that is pedophilic in nature. Figure 1 presents
a heatmap of keywords appearing together in the same queries. Only the highest-
ranked keywords are shown. It is evident from the ﬁgure that the six highest
ranking keywords are well connected: each one of them appears tens to hun-
dreds of times in queries with the other ﬁve keywords. We strongly believe that
such queries are being issued with the intent to ﬁnd torrents of child pornogra-
phy. The percentage of queries where two terms are used in conjunction is only
3.8%, with some of the keywords, such as PTSC and Hussyfan, co-occurring with
other term in over 10% of their appearances. The keyword Yamad, on the other
hand, appears in only 3 queries together with other terms.
On some occasions, connection can be made between pedophile terms and
ordinary words. By ranking words that co-appear in the same queries as pe-
dophile terms, some interesting insights surface. For all keywords, except for one
