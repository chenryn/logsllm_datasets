## Abstract
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks, such as BitTorrent, facilitate the global distribution of multimedia files. However, these networks are also exploited for the dissemination of illegal content, including child sexual abuse material (CSAM), while maintaining the anonymity of both the source and the users. This paper analyzes activity measurements in the BitTorrent network, focusing on CSAM through the Mininova web portal. We identify and characterize pedophilic material within the network and examine various aspects of abusers' activities. Our findings aim to assist law enforcement in detecting and tracking individuals involved in the production and distribution of CSAM.

## 1. Introduction
Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks are widely used by millions of users for sharing content. The anonymity provided by these networks makes them vulnerable to the sharing of illegal content, ranging from copyrighted material to highly dangerous content, such as child sexual abuse material (CSAM).

The BitTorrent file-sharing protocol accounted for 27% to 55% of internet traffic in 2009, depending on geographic location [13]. BitTorrent allows users to download large files without overloading a single source, as users simultaneously download and upload pieces of the file from each other. Each file is uniquely identified by a torrent descriptor, which is distributed via email or HTTP websites. Users, referred to as leechers and seeders, share the content using this descriptor.

Pornography is a significant area of content consumption on the internet. In 2006, over $2.84 billion was spent in the United States alone on internet pornography, with 4.2 million dedicated websites, accounting for 12% of all websites at that time [14]. Child pornography is a subset of this activity, generating over three billion dollars annually (including non-online activity), with over 100,000 websites offering such content and over 116,000 daily queries for "child pornography" in the Gnutella network [14, 15].

Efforts to combat internet-based child sex abuse often involve Content-Based Image and Video Retrieval (CBIR), which detects and retrieves visual files based on previously studied characteristics. Techniques for CBIR have been extensively researched, as seen in [10]. Chopra et al. [2] proposed adapting classification techniques to enable network infrastructure, such as routers, to detect illegal file transfers. Projects like FIVES [3] integrate multiple approaches, from efficient file fragment matching to improved capabilities for linking new illegal multimedia material to existing ones. For video analysis, they use both image features and motion information [7]. Research on CSAM in P2P networks is limited, with notable exceptions like MAPAP [11], which focuses on the eDonkey network, and Hughes et al. [5], who studied the Gnutella network. Liberatore et al. [9] discussed legal issues in investigating CSAM in Gnutella and BitTorrent networks and developed Roundup, a tool used by Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Forces to detect child sex abusers in the Gnutella network, given a list of known CSAM files.

In this paper, we present a study of CSAM activity in the BitTorrent network, examining behavioral patterns in both queries and downloads. Our results can be used by law enforcement to detect and track individuals involved in CSAM activities, such as identifying new illicit files.

## 2. MiniNova Data Set
The Mininova website [12] was a popular BitTorrent portal until a court order forced it to remove all copyrighted torrents at the end of 2009. According to Alexa [1], Mininova was ranked 90th among all worldwide websites, with 1.07% of all internet users visiting it, and was the top torrent website, ahead of The Pirate Bay (ranked 105th), Torrentz.com (ranked 190th), and isoHunt (ranked 196th). The average visitor was a young male without children, aged 18 to 34, browsing from home and staying on the site for 4.3 minutes. Torrents on the website could be found by browsing or searching, with over 950 subcategories. A new torrent uploaded to the website was placed under a subcategory selected by the originator, and the website moderators rarely changed a torrent's location.

The dataset used in this work was obtained from the Mininova website and covers two periods in 2009: September 2nd to September 25th and October 15th to December 7th, totaling 67 days. The dataset was anonymized, with user IP addresses removed. It consists of queries and downloads.

- **Queries:** The query dataset contains 453 million queries, each with the query text, a timestamp, and the city of origin.
- **Downloads:** The downloads dataset includes 515 million torrent downloads, with over 1.3 million distinct torrents. Each download entry contains the torrent's name, subcategory, file size, a timestamp, and the city of the user.

The most popular subcategories on Mininova were action and comedy movies, games for Windows, TV shows (miscellaneous), and eBooks. Pornography was not common on Mininova, and there was no dedicated subcategory for such content. Adult material was often placed under different subcategories, such as "Asian" or "Movies - Other."

### 2.1 Data Set Limitations
The Mininova dataset has several limitations. First, it only covers one torrent website, which may not be representative of CSAM activity in the entire BitTorrent network. Second, user anonymity, with only the city available, makes it difficult to pinpoint specific user activity. The downloads database lacks metadata, making it challenging to classify files and correlate queries and downloads. Lastly, there is no ground truth database for CSAM. We believe that basing our dictionary assumptions on previous work (see Section 1) provides an adequate baseline for our analysis.

## 3. Results
### 3.1 General Statistics
We categorized the queries and downloads into six groups: movies, music, pictures, applications, documents, and unknown. Most of the downloads from Mininova, over 80%, were movies. Next were music files (about 14%) and pictures (3%). For general queries, 53% were for movies, 21% for programs, 14.4% for music, and 8.5% for pictures. For CSAM, queries were approximately two-thirds for movies and one-third for pictures. The number of distinct CSAM files in the database was too small to establish a baseline for download statistics.

### 3.2 Collected Queries Statistics
#### Keywords Ranking
To identify CSAM-related material, we created a dictionary of related words based on previous research [17, 8] and popular online sources [16]. The dictionary includes 47 words, each with a pedophilic meaning, but some may be contextually innocent. For example, "Lolita" on its own versus "Lolita" and "Nabokov," referring to the novel. We applied a filter to known combinations, which total over 40. While the dictionary may not be exhaustive, these words provide a concerning picture.

Table 1 presents the top-10 most used terms in CSAM queries, including the number of occurrences, percentage out of CSAM queries, and percentage out of total queries. "Lolita" and "incest" were the most popular terms. Although these words may also relate to non-CSAM contexts, we argue that at least some queries are still related. About 50% of all CSAM queries were the top two words, and four or five more words were dominant. These words appeared in one of every 25,000 to 100,000 queries, which is considered high.

We compared these results with Gish et al. [4], who analyzed popular queries in the Gnutella network. "PTHC" ranked fifth, appearing in 0.1% of all queries, while "incest" ranked tenth, appearing in 0.05% of all queries. In the Mininova database, these terms were less frequent than in Gnutella, where the most popular queries were pornographic or music-related. Comparing with MAPAP's eDonkey-based research [11], "PTHC" was the most searched term, followed by "Pedo," both more frequently than any other term. Other popular terms in BitTorrent, such as "Lolita," were less popular in eDonkey, while terms like "Preteen" and "Underage" were not ranked at all.

The most frequent queries were also compared with isoHunt's top searches list [6]. IsoHunt, ranked second among torrent websites, does not provide the number of queries per term but ranks them by popularity. All CSAM terms, except "Lolita," were filtered out. Compared to the Mininova top-10 list, "PTHC" was ranked highest (83), followed by "Preteen" (119), "Lolita" (135), "Incest" (143), "Pedo" (257), "12yo" (275), "Underage" (284), and "Hussyfan" (955). Terms like "R@ygold" and "Yamad" were not among the top 1000 searches. Additionally, terms like "7yo" and "9yo" were ranked higher than "12yo." Over time, awareness of P2P networks for ill purposes has grown, leading to changes in users' vocabulary to avoid tracking.

#### Correlation Between Keywords
CSAM-related queries often include more than one pedophilic term. Figure 1 presents a heatmap of keywords appearing together in the same queries, showing the highest-ranked keywords. The six highest-ranking keywords are well-connected, appearing tens to hundreds of times in queries with the other five keywords. We believe such queries are issued to find CSAM torrents. The percentage of queries with two terms used in conjunction is 3.8%, with some keywords, such as PTSC and Hussyfan, co-occurring with other terms in over 10% of their appearances. The keyword Yamad, however, appeared in only three queries with other terms.

On some occasions, connections can be made between CSAM terms and ordinary words. By ranking words that co-appear in the same queries as CSAM terms, interesting insights surface. For all keywords, except for one, the most common co-occurring words were related to the context of the search.
