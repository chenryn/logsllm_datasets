Integrating Google Maps into a Bootstrap layout can sometimes lead to display issues. Please refer to the following examples for illustration:

- [Example 1 (master - problematic)](http://jsbin.com/evuduw/)
- [Example 2 (2.0 work-in-progress - appears resolved)](http://jsbin.com/evuduw/3)

While the maps may appear to render correctly at first glance, attempting to switch the view to "terrain" or toggling the "show labels" option in the first example reveals some quirks. Specifically, the dropdown menu within Google Maps exhibits unusual layout behavior.
