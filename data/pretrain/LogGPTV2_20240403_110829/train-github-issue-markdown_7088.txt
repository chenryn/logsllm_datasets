Deno aims to be as compatible with web browsers as possible, which means we utilize a significant number of Web APIs. Currently, there is limited documentation available for the supported Web APIs, and this situation needs to be addressed before the 1.0 release. Some of these APIs are not fully aligned with the specifications, while others are not yet fully implemented (see issue #3557). It is crucial that all this information is documented and made accessible to end users. This will help to minimize questions and bug reports related to intentional incompatibilities or missing implementations.
