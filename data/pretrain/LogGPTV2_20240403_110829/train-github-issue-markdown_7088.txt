Deno strives to be browser compatible where possible; that means we use quite
a few Web APIs.
There is not much docs for supported Web APIs at the moment and before 1.0 is
released that situation must change. Some of APIs and not fully aligned to
spec, while others are not fully implemented (#3557). All that knowledge
should be written down and presented to end users to avoid multiple
questions/bug reports about purposeful incompatibilities and/or missing
implementations.
