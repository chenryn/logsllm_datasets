### Example Code
    from typing import Tuple
    from fastapi import FastAPI
    from pydantic import BaseModel
    class FooArgs(BaseModel):
        bars: Tuple[str, str]
    app = FastAPI()
    @app.post("/foo")
    def foo(args: FooArgs):
        ...
### Description
If you try to retrieve the `/openapi.json`, the FooArgs get a validation
error:
      File ".../lib/python3.9/site-packages/fastapi/openapi/utils.py", line 410, in get_openapi
        return jsonable_encoder(OpenAPI(**output), by_alias=True, exclude_none=True)  # type: ignore
      File "pydantic/main.py", line 406, in pydantic.main.BaseModel.__init__
    pydantic.error_wrappers.ValidationError: 2 validation errors for OpenAPI
    components -> schemas -> FooArgs -> properties -> bars -> items
      value is not a valid dict (type=type_error.dict)
    components -> schemas -> FooArgs -> $ref
      field required (type=value_error.missing)
This error is new to `fastapi>=0.68`, it **does not** happen with
`fastapi==0.67.0`.
I think this is related to Pydantic coercing `Tuple[str, str]` into `Dict[str,
str]` somewhere?
Things that don't cause this error:
    class FooArgs(BaseModel):
        bars: Tuple[str]
    class FooArgs(BaseModel):
        bars: Tuple[str, ...]
This that do cause this error:
    class FooArgs(BaseModel):
        bars: Tuple[str, str]
    class FooArgs(BaseModel):
        bars: Tuple[int, str]
    class FooArgs(BaseModel):
        bars: Tuple[str, str, str]  # etc.

### Additional Context
Seems pretty likely that this commit introduced it, but there's a lot going on
