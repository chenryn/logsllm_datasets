Parameter
Description
scriptname.extension
Specifies the path and file name of the script file with optional file name extension.
/b
Specifies batch mode, which does not display alerts, scripting errors, or input prompts.
/d

/e:
Specifies the engine that is used to run the script.
/h:cscript
Registers cscript.exe as the default script host for running scripts.
/h:wscript
Registers wscript.exe as the default script host for running scripts. The default.
/i
Specifies interactive mode, which displays alerts, scripting errors, and input prompts. The default, and the opposite of /b.
/job:
Runs the job identified by identifier in a .wsf script file.
/logo
Specifies that the Windows Script Host banner is displayed in the console before the script runs. The default, and the opposite of /nologo.
/nologo
Specifies that the Windows Script Host banner is not displayed before the script runs.
/s
Saves the current command-prompt options for the current user.
/t:
Specifies the maximum time the script can run (in seconds). You can specify up to 32,767 seconds. The default is no time limit.
/u
Specifies Unicode for input and output that is redirected from the console.
/x
Starts the script in the debugger.
/?
Displays available command parameters and provides help for using them. The same as typing cscript.exe with no parameters and no script.
scriptarguments
Specifies the arguments passed to the script. Each script argument must be preceded by a slash (/).
/b
/nologo
Remarks
Each parameter is optional; however, you can't specify script arguments without specifying a script. If you don't specify a script or any script arguments, cscript.exe displays the cscript.exe syntax and the valid host options.
The /t parameter prevents excessive running of scripts by setting a timer. When the run time exceeds the specified value, cscript interrupts the script engine and ends the process.
Windows script files usually have one of the following file name extensions: .wsf, .vbs, .js. Windows Script Host can use .wsf script files. Each .wsf file can use multiple scripting engines and perform multiple jobs.
if you double-click a script file with an extension that has no association, the Open With dialog box appears. Select wscript or cscript, and then select Always use this program to open this file type. This registers wscript.exe or cscript as the default script host for files of this file type.
