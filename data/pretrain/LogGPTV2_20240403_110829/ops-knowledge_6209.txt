**User:**
I am working on a project that requires full access to every directory and file in the Windows file system. I am using Python for this task, but I am encountering issues where I cannot modify or access some files, and I am completely unable to access the C:/ drive with Python, as it shows "permission denied." 

Could you please suggest a way to gain full administrative access using Python? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

**Assistant:**
The simplest solution to achieve full administrative access for your Python script is to run the command prompt (cmd) with administrator privileges. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. Press the **Start/Windows** button.
2. Type `cmd` into the search field.
3. Wait for `cmd.exe` to appear in the search results under programs.
4. Right-click on `cmd.exe`.
5. Select **"Run as administrator"** from the context menu.

Now, your terminal has administrator rights. When you start a Python script within this elevated command prompt, the Python interpreter will also have administrative privileges, allowing you to access and modify files that were previously restricted.
