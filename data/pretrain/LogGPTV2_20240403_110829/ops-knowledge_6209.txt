User: I am on a project in which I need to have full access of each directory or file in the windows file system,I am using python for it.But I cant modify or access some files and totally inaccessible the C:/ drive with python,showing "permission denied". 
I want to know is there any kind of way to get the full access as administrator using python,please suggest and help.
Assistant: For me the easiest solution is an administrator terminal instance. 

Press the start/window button
Enter the search field
Type in cmd and wait until under programs cmd.exe is found
right click on that program
click on the option where you can execute as an administrator
Now your terminal has administrator rights. When you start a python skript inside that terminal the python interpreter has also amdin rights.
