A number of examples spread across various documentation pages still speak of
replication controllers where they should instead say replica sets. Many of
these are of an introductory nature and thus tend to confuse Kubernetes
newcomers in particular (as determined anecdotally by the number of Slack
questions I personally see getting posted in this regard). One particular use
case is the application of the `kubectl run` command which is often
accompanied by telling the reader to run `kubectl get rc` to see the created
replication controllers afterwards where instead it should be `kubectl get rs`
these days to list replica sets.
All such occurrences should be updated accordingly. Specifically, I came
across
  * http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/simple-nginx/
  * http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/pods/multi-container/
  * http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/walkthrough/k8s201/
There may be additional pages though that I'm not aware of.
I'd be happy to provide a PR to update the pages above and any others people
point out.
Thanks.
