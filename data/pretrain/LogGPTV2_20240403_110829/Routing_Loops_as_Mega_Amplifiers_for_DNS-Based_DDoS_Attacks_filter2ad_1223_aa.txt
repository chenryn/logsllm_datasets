Abstract. DDoS attacks are one of the biggest threats to the modern
Internet as their magnitude is constantly increasing. They are highly
eﬀective because of the ampliﬁcation and reﬂection potential of diﬀer-
ent Internet protocols. In this paper, we show how a single DNS query
triggers a response packet ﬂood to the query source, possibly because
of middleboxes located in networks with routing loops. We send DNS
A requests to 3 billion routable IPv4 hosts and ﬁnd 15,909 query desti-
nations from 1,742 autonomous systems that trigger up to 46.7 million
repeating responses. We perform traceroute measurements towards desti-
nation hosts that resulted in the highest ampliﬁcation, locate 115 routing
loops on the way, and notify corresponding network operators. Finally,
we analyze two years of historical scan data and ﬁnd that such “mega
ampliﬁers” are prevalent. In the worst case, a single DNS A request trig-
gered 655 million responses, all returned to a single host.

1 Introduction
Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks have become increasingly common
and constantly growing in size. One of the largest known attacks against Google
services already peaked at 2.54 Tbps and the attack volume is likely to get more
important with time [18]. The two main factors that contribute to the eﬀective-
ness of DDoS attacks are reﬂection and ampliﬁcation. Attackers use Internet
services that satisfy two requirements: respond to their requests (reﬂect) and
generate either a large number of responses or a response of a much larger size
(amplify) towards a victim. Reﬂection attacks are only eﬀective when compro-
mised hosts (bots) send requests with spoofed IP addresses. Consequently, they
need to be located in networks that do not deploy Source Address Validation
(SAV), known as Best Current Practice 38 (BCP-38) [22,50], for outgoing traﬃc.
Several initiatives aim at reducing the possibility of DDoS attacks [1,5,6,
11,27,28,30,34,37,38,46,47,49,55,61], for instance, measurements of the ampli-
ﬁcation potential of diﬀerent protocols and notiﬁcations of the aﬀected par-
ties. Other non-proﬁt initiatives, such as Shadowserver Foundation [51], provide

daily reports to network operators and 132 national Computer Security Incident
Response Teams (CSIRTs).
Amplifying services are mostly UDP-based because of their connectionless
nature. An attacker sends spoofed requests and the services reﬂect responses to
victims. The most prominent UDP reﬂectors are NTP and DNS [20,21], which
have been leveraged by several attack vectors [1,6,11,34,46]. Theoretically, the
TCP three-way handshake prevents the connection establishment with spoofed
hosts because the response of the reﬂecting service goes to the victim and not
to the host launching the attack. Nevertheless, certain TCP implementations
are prone to ampliﬁcation [27,28] and potentially with inﬁnite ampliﬁcation
factors [5].
In the concurrent work, Bock et al. [5] located middleboxes inside routing
loops by sending a sequence of carefully crafted TCP packets. They even found
19 IP addresses that triggered inﬁnite loops. In our work, we show that a trivial
DNS A request is enough to trigger a similar behavior. Moreover, we identify
64 IP addresses triggering possibly inﬁnite ampliﬁcation. Our methodology con-
sists of probing the whole routable IPv4 address space with DNS A requests to
ﬁnd 15,909 destination addresses from 1,742 autonomous systems (ASes) trig-
gering up to 46.7 million identical response packets. We then run traceroute
measurements towards 435 destination hosts that resulted in the highest ampli-
ﬁcation and identify 115 routing loops involving 35 autonomous systems. We
have reported these ﬁndings to network operators. Finally, we analyze 2 years of
packet traces from our DNS scans in both IPv4 and IPv6 address spaces to ﬁnd
944,087 requests that triggered repeating responses—397 of them caused more
than 1,000 responses and 18 requests caused more than 1 million responses. As
an extreme case, one DNS A request triggered 655 million responses.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides background
on DDoS attacks, ampliﬁcation, and reﬂection. Section 3 describes the threat
model and Sect. 4 introduces the measurement setup. We present scan results
and analyze the persistence of the vulnerability in Sect. 5. Section 6 discusses
ethical considerations and disclosure. Finally, we present related work in Sect. 7
and conclude in Sect. 8.
2 Background on DDoS Attacks
One of the largest DDoS attacks known to date took place in September 2017 and
was reported by Google in October 2020 [18]. Attackers sent spoofed requests
to SNMP, CLDAP, and DNS servers that, in turn, sent ampliﬁed responses to
Google. The reﬂected traﬃc peaked at 2.54 Tbps. In February 2020, Amazon
Web Services (AWS) reported an attack using hijacked CLDAP servers that
generated traﬃc up to 2.3 Tbps [3]. If measured in requests per second (rps), two
prominent attacks happened in 2021: Yandex [45] and Cloudﬂare [62] reported
receiving 21.8 million and 17.2 million rps, respectively. As the Internet grows
in terms of computing power, bandwidth, and the number of connected devices,
the volume of DDoS attacks becomes increasingly high [18].

A DDoS attack aims to overwhelm the victim service with a tremendous
amount of traﬃc to prevent legitimate clients from using the service. Although
an attacker alone may achieve this eﬀect, large-scale attacks usually rely on
botnets, networks of compromised machines that receive instructions from the
command-and-control (C&C) center (operated by the attacker).
The real danger of DDoS attacks comes from reﬂectors and ampliﬁers. A
reﬂector is a machine that accepts a request (with a spoofed source IP address)
and sends a response [44]. There are millions of services on the Internet such as
web servers or open DNS resolvers that can act as reﬂectors. Once reﬂecting ser-
vices are located, the attacker instructs the botnet under her/his control to start
sending requests. Requests with the spoofed source IP addresses of victims are
sent to reﬂectors. As a result, the victim receives all the reﬂected traﬃc. Care-
fully crafted requests can trigger reﬂectors to send large or numerous responses;
such reﬂectors are called ampliﬁers.
There are several ways to assess the eﬀectiveness of a DDoS attack. We can
measure the absolute amount of generated traﬃc in packets per second (pps), bits
per second (bps) or requests per second (rps) [18]. In the case of ampliﬁcation,
another informative metric is the ratio of traﬃc generated by the ampliﬁer to
the traﬃc needed to trigger the ampliﬁer. Rossow [47] proposed two units of
measurement: bandwidth ampliﬁcation factor (BAF) and packet ampliﬁcation
factor (PAF). BAF divides the size of the packet payload sent from the ampliﬁer
to the victim by the size of the packet payload sent from the attacker to the
ampliﬁer. Likewise, PAF divides the number of packets sent to the victim by the
number of packets sent to the ampliﬁer. In both cases, the higher the value, the
more destructive the attack is.
In the remainder of this paper, we use Rossow’s [47] packet ampliﬁcation
factor (PAF) metric to assess the ampliﬁcation potential of DNS queries caught
in routing loops. As we only send one DNS request, the PAF is always equal to
the number of received responses.
3 Threat Model
Our threat model is an ampliﬁed and reﬂective DDoS attack in which the
attacker sends DNS queries. Therefore, we ﬁrst recall how regular DNS reso-
lution operates. It starts with a client sending its DNS request to a recursive
resolver. This entity is capable of following the domain name tree from the root
down to the authoritative nameservers of a given domain. Recursive resolvers
heavily rely on caching and query prefetching to speed up the resolution pro-
cess. Whether it succeeds or not, a recursive resolver returns a response packet
to the client with one of the deﬁned response codes [35]. Thus, a client expects
to receive a single response packet for a single request.
When one is constantly receiving multiple copies of the same packet, there
might be some routing anomaly on the way between the sender and the receiver,
such as loops. Routing loops are a well-known, old phenomenon, extensively
studied in the literature [19,32,43,54,60,63–65]. They fall into two broad cate-
gories: transient and persistent. Transient loops appear when topology changes

the request never reaches the receiver, the sender receives replies from the middlebox.
and the routing protocol has not yet converged. Such loops do not require man-
ual intervention to be resolved. Persistent loops are likely to be a result of a
misconﬁguration, such as announcing addresses that are routable but not allo-
cated [32,60]. A packet entering the routing loop is very likely not to reach the
destination. Xia et al. [60] analyzed the location of routing loops and found that
the majority of them involve destination autonomous systems. We report similar
ﬁndings later in Sect. 5.2. Consequently, the same loops can be triggered from
multiple vantage points.
Recently, Bock et al. [5] discovered that networking middleboxes (such as
ﬁrewalls or national censors), when located inside the routing loop, continuously
process a request caught in a loop and keep responding to it. Figure 1 illustrates
such a setup. The sender (1.2.3.4) sends a request to the receiver (5.6.7.8) via
R1 and R2. Somewhere on its way (in transit or at the destination autonomous
system), the request packet enters the routing loop between R2, R3, and R4.
Each time the packet goes from R2 to R3, it triggers the middlebox to respond
to the sender (more precisely, to the host with the source IP address of the
packet, which can be spoofed). The receiver (5.6.7.8) never sees the request.
Such a looping packet should be dropped when its time-to-live (TTL) reaches
0. However, if the TTL is not decreased for any reason, the packet may loop
inﬁnitely (or until a reboot or router failure drops it).
An attacker knowing about the presence of routing loops and middleboxes can
achieve two principal goals: saturate links involved in the routing loop and reﬂect
the generated responses. If the loop is located in the destination autonomous
system (AS) and the spoofed source IP address belongs to the same AS, such
a packet may be dropped at the network edge even before reaching the loop. It
happens when SAV for incoming traﬃc drops the packet from the outside with
the source IP belonging to the inner network. However, recent work showed that
inbound SAV is not widely deployed [12,23–25].
We have very few assumptions about the capabilities of the attacker. Most
importantly, (s)he has to be located in the network that allows outbound spoof-
ing. Thus, DNS packets with spoofed IP addresses can leave the network. Recent

work showed that such misconﬁgured networks are still not uncommon on the
Internet [31,33] and they are publicly listed [8]. The attacker does not have any
special hardware or software requirements, because a single DNS packet, occa-
sionally resent, is enough to keep the loop going. Finally, it is not necessary to
register a domain name as any existing one can be queried.
4 Internet-Wide Scans
Our measurement technique relies on sending DNS requests to trigger routing
loops. In IPv4, we probe all the routable preﬁxes retrieved from the RouteViews
dataset [48], resulting in more than 3 billion individual IP addresses. In IPv6,
however, the exhaustive scan of the routable space is not feasible. Instead, we
