**Symfony version(s) affected** : Probably all of them, but I am currently in
4.1
**Description**
When you try to put the Translator Path in an envrionment variable, Symfony
try to check if the Path exist **BEFORE** the compilation of the envrionment
variable.
So with `'%env(resolve:PATH_TRANSLATION)%'`, Symfony throw an
UnexpectedValueException : `%env(resolve:PATH_TRANSLATION)% defined in
translator.paths does not exist or is not a directory`.
**How to reproduce**
You can reproduce the bug easily by adding an environment variable (in `.env`)
and resolve it in the config file.
    framework:
        translator:
            paths:
                - '%env(resolve:PATH_TRANSLATION)%'
**Possible Solution**
Symfony should resolve the environment variable before checking if the file
exist or not.
