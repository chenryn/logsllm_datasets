User: I have an hourly cron job which has been running in Openshift free gear for almost a year and has been no problem.  But the past 2 days, cron job stops running automatically.  I have been googling around and still cannot find what went wrong.  Here are what I have checked/done to date

the service I use to keep the site alive is still up and running as normal.  So it is not a case of being idle.
force restart the app.  Cron job still not started automatically as it used to.
fake changes to cron script file and push to Openshift.  Still not fixed this.
log files looks ok
Mon May  4 13:01:07 EDT 2015: START hourly cron run
Mon May  4 13:01:29 EDT 2015: END hourly cron run - status=0

Any advice or pointer as to why it just stop working when there is no change to the app.  Thank you.
