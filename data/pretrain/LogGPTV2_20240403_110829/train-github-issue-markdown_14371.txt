Hi,  
I've actually posted an issue 7753  
In a word, I tried same sample_weight in SVC (linear kernel) and LinearSVC and
got different results. I got feedback that the LinearSVC is "less sensitive"
to sample_weight, but I still wonder how are they different? I want to know
mathematically what they means. Currently the API documentation (and user
guide) does not contain such description, so could we possibly add them?  
Thank you very much!
