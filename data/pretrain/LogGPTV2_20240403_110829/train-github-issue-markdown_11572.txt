Just updated to 5.8.23 and noticed this in our diff:
Input (context):
        } else if (add) {
          if (!(model = this._prepareModel(attrs, options))) continue;
          toAdd.push(model);
          this._byId[model.cid] = model;
          if (model.id != null) this._byId[model.id] = model;
        }
Output (context):
        } else if (add) {
            if (!(model = this._prepareModel(attrs, options))) continue;
            toAdd.push(model);
            this._byId[model.cid] = model;
            if (model.id != null) this._byId[model.id] = model;
          }
No changes in the source file (as far as I can tell).
Unfortunately I'm not sure how to check which version of Babel I was using
previously as I just ran `npm update`. Somewhere between 5.5.8 and 5.8.23.
Thanks for the great work. üëç
