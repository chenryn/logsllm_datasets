are reasonable or not. We thus applied our tool on our 184 ﬂows to obtain
818 stationary ﬂows. To assess the relevance of the approach, we proceeded
as follows: for any two neighboring stationary ﬂows from the same ﬂow, we
compute their means µ1 and µ2 and their standard deviations σ1 and σ2. We
× 100 and ”jump in standard
then compute the ”jump in mean” ∆µ = µ2−µ1
×100. We then break each stationary ﬂows into two sub-
deviation” ∆σ = σ2−σ1
ﬂows of equal size and compute their means µi
2 and standard deviations σi
1
and σi
2 (i = 1, 2). We can then deﬁne jumps in means and standard deviations
between two sub-ﬂows of a given stationary ﬂow. The latter jumps are called
intra jumps while the jumps between stationary ﬂows are called inter jumps.
The idea behind these deﬁnitions is to demonstrate that the distributions of intra
jumps are more concentrated around their mean value than the distributions of
inter jumps. To compare those distributions, we used boxplot representations.
A boxplot of a distribution is a box where the upper line corresponds to the
75 percentile ˆp0.75 of the distribution, the lower line to the 25 percentile ˆp0.25
and the central line to the median. In addition, the ˆp0.25 − 1.5 × IQR and
ˆp0.75 + 1.5 × IQR values (IQR = ˆp0.75 − ˆp0.25 is the inter quantile range, which
captures the variability of the sample) are also graphed while the samples falling
outside these limits are marked with a cross. A boxplot allows to quickly compare
two distributions and to assess the symmetry and the dispersion of a given
distribution. In ﬁgure 6, we plotted the boxplots for the inter jump in mean

(left side) and intra jump in mean (right side). From these representations, we
immediately see that the intra jump distribution is thinner than the inter jumps
distribution which complies with our initial intuition. Note also that the means
of the inter and intra jump distributions are close to zero as the ∆µ deﬁnition
can result in positive or negative values and it is quite reasonable that overall,
we observe as much positive as negative jumps. Figure 7 depicts the boxplots
for the inter and intra jumps in standard deviations. The results are somehow
similar to the ones for jumps in mean although less pronounced and more skewed
toward large positive values.
5 Results on the BitTorrent Dataset
Stationary Periods Characterization
5.1
As stated in the previous section, the K-S change point tool has extracted 818
stationary ﬂows out of the 184 initial ﬂows. This means that, on average, a ﬂow
is cut into 4.45 stationary ﬂows. Figure 8 represents the cumulative distribution
functions (cdf) of the duration of stationary and initial ﬂows. Stationary ﬂows
have an average duration of 16.4 minutes while initial ﬂows have an average
duration of 73 minutes.
Figure 9 represents the cumulative distribution functions of throughputs of
the stationary and initial ﬂows. Overall, stationary ﬂows tend to exhibit larger
throughputs than initial ﬂows. Indeed, the mean throughput of stationary ﬂows
is 493.5 kbits/s as compared to 444 kbit/s for the initial ones. This discrepancy
is an indication that the K-S change point test is working properly as it extracts
from the initial ﬂows stationary periods where the throughputs signiﬁcantly
diﬀer from the mean throughput of the ﬂow. The cdfs diﬀer at the end because
whenever the K-S test exhibits a small period (relative to the ﬂow it is extracted
from) with high throughput, it will become one sample for the cdf of stationary
ﬂows, whereas it might have little impact for the corresponding sample for the
cdf of the initial ﬂows (if the high throughput part only corresponds to a small
fraction of the initial ﬂow).

Using our tool, we can also investigate transitions between consecutive sta-
tionary periods. The left boxplot of ﬁgure 6 allows us to look globally at transi-
tions between stationary periods. From this ﬁgure, we can observe that most of
the changes result in jumps of the mean value that are less than 20% in absolute
values. This is encouraging for applications that can tolerate such changes in
their observed throughput since they can expect to experience quite long stable
periods, typically several tens of minutes (at least in the context of our dataset).
However, a lot of values fall outside the plus or minus 1.5×IQR interval, meaning
that some transitions are clearly more sharp than others.
The Case of Receiver Window Limited Connections
5.2
In a eﬀort to relate the stationarity observed by our tool to the intrinsic char-
acteristics of the connections, we considered the case of receiver window limited
ﬂows. A receiver window limited ﬂow is a ﬂow whose throughput is limited by
the advertised window of the receiver. The motivation behind this study is that
as receiver window limited ﬂows are mostly constrained by some end hosts char-
acteristics (the advertised window of the receiver), they should exhibit longer
stationary periods than other ﬂows. Indeed, the intuition is that those other
ﬂows have to compete ”more” for resources along their path with side traﬃc,
which should aﬀect their throughput, leading to change points.
We ﬁrst have to devise a test that ﬂags receiver window limited ﬂows. We
proceed as follows. For each ﬂow, we generate two time series with a granularity
of 10 seconds. The ﬁrst time series, Adv(t) represents the advertised window of
the receiver while the second one, Out(t) accounts for the diﬀerence between
the maximum unacknowledged byte and the maximum acknowledged byte. The
second time series provides an estimate of the number of outstanding bytes on
the path at a given time instant. The Out(t) time series is accurate except during
loss periods. Note that the computation of Out(t) is possible since our dataset
was collected at the sender side, as the Eurecom peer in the BitTorrent session
was acting as a seed during the measurement period. A ﬂow is then ﬂagged
receiver window limited if the following condition holds:
(cid:3)N
t=1 1Adv(t)−3×M SS≤Out(t)≤Adv(t)
≥ 0.8
N
where N is the size of the two time series and M SS is the maximum segment size
of the path. The above criterion simply states that 80% of the time, the estimated
number of outstanding packets must lie between the advertised window minus
three M SS and the advertised window. By choosing a treshold of 80%, we expect
to be conservative.
Application of the test on our dataset leads us to ﬂag about 13.7% of the
ﬂows as receiver window limited. The next issue is to choose the non window
limited ﬂows. We adopt the following criterion:
(cid:3)N
t=1 1Out(t)≤Adv(t)−3×M SS
≥ 0.9.

throughputs
Applying the above criterion, we obtained about 14.4% of non receiver window
limited ﬂows. A straightforward comparison of the durations of the stationary
ﬂows extracted from the ﬂows of the two families (receiver window limited and
non receiver limited) is misleading as the duration of their respective connec-
tions is diﬀerent. We thus use two other metrics. First, we compute the number
of stationary ﬂows into which a ﬂow is cut in each family. We obtain that the
receiver window limited ﬂows are on average cut into 3.5 stationary ﬂows while
non receiver window limited ﬂows are cut into 4.5 stationary ﬂows. The second
metric we consider is the relative size, in percentage, of the stationary ﬂows with
respect to the size of ﬂow they are extracted from for the two familied. Figure 10
represents the cumulative distribution functions of the percentages for the two
families. From this ﬁgure, we observe that receiver window limited stationary
ﬂows are relatively larger than non receiver window limited ones in most cases.
Also, in ﬁgure 11, we plot the cumulative distributions of the throughput of
the stationary ﬂows for both families. We conclude from ﬁgure 11 that receiver
window limited stationary ﬂows exhibit signiﬁcantly smaller throughputs values
than non receiver window limited ones. This might mean that receiver limited
ﬂows correspond to paths with larger RTT than non receiver window limited
ones, as this would prevent these ﬂows from achieving high throughput values.
This last point as well as our deﬁnition of window limited ﬂows (we only con-
sidered around 28% of the ﬂows of our dataset to obtain those results) would
clearly deserve more investigation.
6 Conclusion and Outlook
Internet Traﬃc analysis becomes a crucial activity, e.g. for ISPs to do trou-
bleshooting or for content providers and researchers that are willing to devise
new multimedia services in the Internet. Once information on some path has
been collected, its needs to be analyzed. The ﬁrst step is to divide traces into
somewhat homogeneous period and to ﬂag anomalies. In this paper, we concen-

trate on the analysis of the service perceived by long TCP connections in the
Internet. We have developed a change point analysis tool that extracts stationary
periods within connections. We follow a non parametric approach and based our
tool on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness of ﬁt test. We validated our change
point tool in various ways on synthetic and operational datasets. Overall, the
tool manages to correctly ﬂag change points as long as little correlation persists
at the time scale at which it is applied. We worked at the 10 second time scale,
which is a reasonable time scale for some multimedia applications such as VoD.
We also focused on receiver window limited connections to relate the stationarity
observed by our tool to typical connection behaviors.
As future work, we intent to pursue in this direction by correlating the sta-
tionarity periods with some other network events like RTT variations or loss
rates. We would also like to study the extent to which our tool could be used in
real time and to investigate how it could be tailored to the need of some speciﬁc
applications. It is also necessary to compare our tool with some other change
point techniques [1].
