### Are Reasonable or Not

To evaluate the reasonableness of our approach, we applied our tool to 184 flows, resulting in 818 stationary flows. To assess the relevance of this method, we followed these steps: for any two neighboring stationary flows from the same original flow, we computed their means (µ1 and µ2) and standard deviations (σ1 and σ2). We then calculated the "jump in mean" (∆µ) and "jump in standard deviation" (∆σ) as follows:

\[
\Delta \mu = \frac{\mu_2 - \mu_1}{\mu_1} \times 100
\]
\[
\Delta \sigma = \frac{\sigma_2 - \sigma_1}{\sigma_1} \times 100
\]

Next, we divided each stationary flow into two sub-flows of equal size and computed their means (µi1 and µi2) and standard deviations (σi1 and σi2) for i = 1, 2. This allowed us to define jumps in means and standard deviations between the sub-flows of a given stationary flow. These jumps are referred to as "intra jumps," while the jumps between stationary flows are called "inter jumps."

The goal is to demonstrate that the distributions of intra jumps are more concentrated around their mean value compared to the distributions of inter jumps. To compare these distributions, we used boxplot representations. A boxplot of a distribution shows the 75th percentile (upper line), the 25th percentile (lower line), and the median (central line). Additionally, the values ˆp0.25 − 1.5 × IQR and ˆp0.75 + 1.5 × IQR (where IQR is the interquartile range, capturing the variability of the sample) are also graphed, with samples outside these limits marked with a cross. Boxplots allow for a quick comparison of two distributions and an assessment of their symmetry and dispersion.

In Figure 6, we plotted the boxplots for the inter jump in mean (left side) and intra jump in mean (right side). From these representations, it is evident that the intra jump distribution is narrower than the inter jump distribution, aligning with our initial intuition. It is also noted that the means of the inter and intra jump distributions are close to zero, as the ∆µ definition can result in both positive and negative values, and it is reasonable to observe a balance of positive and negative jumps. Figure 7 depicts the boxplots for the inter and intra jumps in standard deviations, showing similar but less pronounced results, with a skew toward large positive values.

### 5. Results on the BitTorrent Dataset

#### 5.1 Stationary Periods Characterization

As mentioned earlier, the K-S change point tool extracted 818 stationary flows from the 184 initial flows, meaning that, on average, each flow was divided into 4.45 stationary flows. Figure 8 shows the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the durations of stationary and initial flows. The average duration of stationary flows is 16.4 minutes, while the average duration of initial flows is 73 minutes.

Figure 9 presents the CDFs of the throughputs of stationary and initial flows. Overall, stationary flows exhibit higher throughputs than initial flows. The mean throughput of stationary flows is 493.5 kbits/s, compared to 444 kbits/s for the initial flows. This discrepancy indicates that the K-S change point test effectively extracts stationary periods with significantly different throughputs from the mean throughput of the flow. The CDFs differ at the end because small, high-throughput periods in the initial flows become distinct samples in the CDF of stationary flows, whereas they might have little impact on the CDF of the initial flows.

### 5.2 The Case of Receiver Window Limited Connections

To relate the stationarity observed by our tool to the intrinsic characteristics of the connections, we considered receiver window limited flows. These are flows whose throughput is constrained by the advertised window of the receiver. The motivation is that such flows, being primarily limited by the receiver's characteristics, should exhibit longer stationary periods than other flows, which may be affected by competition for resources along their path.

We developed a test to identify receiver window limited flows. For each flow, we generated two time series with a 10-second granularity: Adv(t) for the advertised window and Out(t) for the difference between the maximum unacknowledged byte and the maximum acknowledged byte. A flow is flagged as receiver window limited if the following condition holds:

\[
\frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^{N} \mathbb{1}_{\text{Adv}(t) - 3 \times \text{MSS} \leq \text{Out}(t) \leq \text{Adv}(t)} \geq 0.8
\]

where N is the size of the time series and MSS is the maximum segment size. This criterion states that 80% of the time, the estimated number of outstanding packets must lie between the advertised window minus three MSS and the advertised window.

Applying this test, we flagged about 13.7% of the flows as receiver window limited. For non-window limited flows, we used the following criterion:

\[
\frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^{N} \mathbb{1}_{\text{Out}(t) \leq \text{Adv}(t) - 3 \times \text{MSS}} \geq 0.9
\]

This resulted in approximately 14.4% of non-receiver window limited flows. A direct comparison of the durations of stationary flows from both families is misleading due to differences in connection durations. Therefore, we used two metrics: the number of stationary flows into which a flow is divided and the relative size of the stationary flows. On average, receiver window limited flows are divided into 3.5 stationary flows, while non-receiver window limited flows are divided into 4.5 stationary flows. Figure 10 shows the CDFs of the relative sizes of the stationary flows, indicating that receiver window limited stationary flows are generally larger. Figure 11 plots the CDFs of the throughputs of the stationary flows, showing that receiver window limited stationary flows exhibit lower throughputs, possibly due to higher round-trip times (RTTs).

### 6. Conclusion and Outlook

Internet traffic analysis is crucial for various stakeholders, including ISPs for troubleshooting and content providers for developing new services. The first step in analyzing collected data is to divide traces into homogeneous periods and flag anomalies. In this paper, we focused on the analysis of long TCP connections using a change point analysis tool based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit test. We validated our tool on synthetic and operational datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in flagging change points as long as there is little correlation at the 10-second time scale, which is suitable for applications like Video on Demand (VoD).

Future work will involve correlating stationarity periods with network events such as RTT variations and loss rates, exploring real-time application, and comparing our tool with other change point techniques [1].
