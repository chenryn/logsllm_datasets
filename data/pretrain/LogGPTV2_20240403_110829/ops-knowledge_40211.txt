User: My (Python) AppEngine program fetches a web page from another site to scrape data from it -- but it seems like the 3rd party site is blocking requests from Google App Engine! -- I can fetch the page from development mode, but not when deployed.
Can I get around this by using a free proxy of some sort?
Can I use a free proxy to hide the fact that I am requesting from App Engine?
How do I find/choose a proxy? -- what do I need?  --  how do I perform the fetch?
Is there anything else I need to know or watch out for?
Assistant: I'm currently having the same problem and i was thinking about this solution (not yet tried) :
-> develop an app that fetch what you want 
-> run it locally
-> fetch your local server from your initial 
so the proxy is your computer which you know as not blocked 
Let me know if it's works !
