Interesting Features of 
Kernel Security 
1
Goal: 
Revising Windows 8 Release Preview 
Find new security features to defend or mitigate kernel 
vulnerability attack 
Target: 
ntoskrnl 
Tools: IDA Pro/Hex-rays/windbg 
  Agenda 
2
– Disable Null Page Memory Allocation 
– Disable Win32k System Call 
– Security Failure Interrupt 
– Nonexecutable NonPaged Pool 
– Apply Intel® Secure Key Technology  
– Apply Intel® SMEP Technology  
              Agenda 
3
– Null-page memory：for 16bit VM:ntvdm 
– Allocate null-page memory by using ZwAllocateVirtualmemory 
to Trigger uninitialized object pointer reference vulnerability or 
to achieve other vulnerability attack 
• Example： CVE-2010-4398  
     N-Protect TKRgAc2k.sys kernel 0day(POC2010) 
– Now the system disallow low address (0x0~0x10000) allocation 
in Windows8 
– EPROCESS->Flags.VdmAllowed 
Disallow Null Page Allocation 
4
– 16bit virtual machine is disabled by default in windows8, 
only administrators can enable it 
Disallow Null Page Allocation 
5
– Windows8 checks all the locations to which null page can be 
allocated.  
• MiCreatePebOrTeb：create peb or teb  
• MiMapViewOfImageSection->MiIsVaRangeAvailable: 
 Mapping image section 
• MiMapViewOfDataSection/MiMapViewOfPhysicalSection 
 Mapping data/physical section   
• MmMapLockedPagesSpecifyCache/MmMapLockedPages-> 
MiMapLockedPagesInUserSpace 
• Mapping in user address space 
• NtAllocateVirtualMemory:Allocate process memory 
Disallow Null Page Allocation 
6
Disallow win32k system call 
– EPROCESS->Flags2.DisallowWin32kSystemCalls 
– KiFastCallEntry(2)->PsConvertToGuiThread 
        Disallow win32k system call 
7
– Why disallow win32k system call 
– Win32k.sys: a high incidence of windows kernel 
vulnerability, can be called without process privilege control 
•  MS11-087 Trojan.win32.Duqu : win32k.sys font parse vulnerability 
– Current application sandbox defense method 
• Job UI restriction (ineffective) 
– Disallowing win32k system call can easily defend any 
win32k related 0day without using 3rd party kernel driver 
– Also can defense user/gdi sandbox attack trick which does 
not use 0day 
        Disallow win32k system call 
8
– PsConvertToGuiThread : Used by GUI thread to make its 
initial win32k system call  
– After applying DisallowWin32kSystemCalls flag, any system 
call for user/gdi will fail.  
– 3 methods to get this flag： 
•  1.IEFO Registry Configuration : 
– HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image 
File Execution Options\MitigationOptions (0x10000000) 
– NtCreateUserProcess->PspAllocateProcess-> 
PspApplyMitigationOptions 
•  2.Documented API:SetProcessMitigationPolicy 
– NtSetInformationProcess->ProcessMitigationPolicy 
•  3.Inherit from parent process 
        Disallow win32k system call 
9
– New security failure interruption in Windows8: INT 0x29 
– Will trigger BSOD when used during security failure of 
windows kernel or other drivers.  
– Most commonly used in double-linked list operation. Such 
interruption is added to all the double-linked list in Windows 
OS Loader / kernel and kernel drivers  
– So called “Safe Linking & Safe Unlinking” 
• Safe Linking::IoRegisterFsRegistrationChangeMountAware 
• Safe Unlinking:IoUnregisterFileSystem 
– To defense attack trick such as using tampered list entry 
structure to manipulate a Write-What-Where condition 
Security Failure Interruption 
10
   Security Failure Interrupt 
Safe unlinking and int 0x29 interrupt: IoUnregisterFileSystem 
11
– KiRaiseSecurityCheckFailure : 
• Int 0x29 Interrupts handler routine 
• It simply calls KiFastFailDispatch->KiBugCheck to show BSOD 
– Bug check code: 0x139 : Currently not documented 
• Parameter:ecx :The Error ID 
– Known Security Fast-Fail Error ID: 
• 0x2: Kernel driver security cookie exception 
• 0x3: Safe unlinking / Safe linking exception 
• 0x6: Kernel driver security cookie initialize exception 
• 0x9: RtlQueryRegistryValuesEx using untrust key(CVE-2010-4398 ) 
Security Failure Interruption 
12
– Before Windows8 , kernel and kernel drivers can only use 
ExAllocatePoolXXX API to allocate executable nonpaged memory 
– Executable nonpaged pool can be used to create kernel vulnerability 
ROP attack 
– In Windows8 , There are some new pool types: 
•
NonPagedPoolNx  
•
NonPagedPoolNxCacheAligned              
•
NonPagedPoolSessionNx                   
– Kernel pool memory which is allocated from NonPagedPoolNx type 
is nonexecutable now, code executable in this type of pool will cause 
a system crash 
– Windows8 kernel and kernel drivers now use NonPagedPoolNx 
instead of NonPagedPool type 
    Nonexecutable Nonpaged Pool 
13
    Nonexecutable Nonpaged Pool 
– Kernel uses nonexecutable nonpagedpool  
– IoAllocateDriverObjectExtension 
14
    Apply Intel® Secure Key Technology  
– Intel® Secure Key Technology , code name: Bull Mountain 
Technology 
– Introduced in April 2012, Intel 3rd generation Core processor: 
Ivy Bridge 
• Offers hardware approach to high-quality,high-performance entropy and 
random number generator 
– New Intel 64 Architecture instruction: RDRAND 
– Windows8 kernel uses this instruction to generate random 
number to produce security cookie and ASLR address 
– Related Function：ExGenRandom 
15
    Apply Intel® Secure Key Technology  
– Past kernel random number attacks: security cookie prediction 
& ASLR brute force 
– Before Windows8 , Windows kernel use system clock to 
generate security cookie and ASLR address 
– Base on module loading time, security cookie can be easily 
predicted with a success rate of more than 46 percent(j00ru).  
– J00ru. Windows Kernel-mode GS Cookies subverted.  
– H. Shacham, M. Page, B. Pfaff, E.-J. Goh, N. Modadugu, and D. 
Boneh. On the effectiveness of address-space randomization.  
– Windows 8 kernel use security cookie generated by Intel secure 
key technology and apply it to all loaded kernel drivers 
16
    Apply Intel® Secure Key Technology  
•
When loading the kernel driver, Windows 8 calls MiProcessLoadConfigForDriver to 
generate security cookie, locates old security cookie in PE and replaces it.  
•
New Windows8 kernel drivers will check if their security cookies are already 
replaced.  
17
    Apply Intel® Secure Key Technology  
– The way of Windows7 kernel generates security cookie: 
HalQueryRealTimeClock(from CMOS) ^ rdtsc 
– The way of Windows8 kernel generates security cookie: 
ExGenRandom-> ExpSecurityCookieRandomData ^ rdtsc 
– Windows8 runtime kernel does not directly use RDRAND instruction 
– ExGenRandom uses random entropy source generated from OS Loader 
calling  RDRAND instruction in system booting process 
• Winload! OslpGatherRdrandEntropy 
– In fact , OS Loader use 5 methods to get high quality random number 
entropy sources 
– External entropy(from registry)\TPM entropy\clock entropy\ACPI 
entropy\RDRAND entropy 
18
    Apply Intel® Secure Key Technology  
– IDA Pro 6.3 supports RDRAND instruction decoding.  
– Winload initializing SecureKey in system booting process 
19
    Apply Intel® Secure Key Technology  
– ExGenRandom is also used in these kernel functions： 
• Kernel pool quota cookie 
• Kernel pool address allocation randomization 
• PEB/TEB address randomization 
• Kernel module address randomization 
• Thread stack and heap address randomization 
– And user functions: 
• Shared User Data->Cookie(ring3 Ldr* encode and decode) 
• User address space memory allocation randomization 
• User data section and image section allocation randomization

Guillaume. Bypassing ASLR and DEP on Adobe Reader X 
–
The sandbox inside Adobe Reader X  and Google Chrome browser uses 
VirtualAllocEx function to allocate memory and copy System Call Stub jump 
shell code into it. 
–
 In Win7 and previous OS, memory allocated by VirtualAllocEx function is not 
randomized. There is more than 85 percent chance the shell code base 
address will hit a fixed address in every booting.  
–
The attacker uses System Call Stub jump code in fixed address to allocate 
executable memory and bypass DEP+ASLR 
–
Windoows8：System uses MmInitializeProcessAddressSpace to call 
ExGenRandom and generate random number during process startup 
–
When process uses NtAllocateVirtualMemory to allocate memory ,system uses 
MiSelectAddress to select a randomized address with generated random 
number 
21
    Apply Intel® Secure Key Technology  
– A comparison test between Windows7 and Windows8 in remote 
user memory allocation address 
– Start calc.exe process 20 times and allocate remote buffer in it 
22
          Apply Intel® SMEP Technology  
– SMEP : Supervisor-Mode Execution Prevention 
– Also introduced in April 2012 of Intel 3rd generation Core processor: 
Ivy Bridge 
– New hardware protection mechanism provided by Intel CPU, allows 
pages to be protected from supervisor mode instruction fetches. 
– Background：Most kernel vulnerability attacks use tricks to make 
kernel code jumping to preset shell code which is placed in user 
address space 
– Classic trick： 
– Replace HalDispatchTable-> HalQuerySystemInformation 
– Why place shell code in ring3 address space? Payload and address 
randomization.  
23
          Apply Intel® SMEP Technology  
– When SMEP is enabled: 
• Supervisor-mode(CPL Phase1InitializationDiscard -
>KiInitMachineDependent 
24
          Apply Intel® SMEP Technology  
– MI_CHECK_KERNEL_NOEXECUTE_FAULT 
– Windows8 uses this function to process two kinds of 
nonexecutable exceptions in Page Fault Trap handler: KiTrap0E 
25
          Apply Intel® SMEP Technology  
– An way to bypass SMEP: put shell code into kernel object memory, 
and get kernel object address with NtQuerySystemInformation-
>SystemHandleInformation(Ex) 
– Available target object：FileObject ? 
26
          Apply Intel® SMEP Technology  
– Impossible in Windows8: SMEP + NonPagedPoolNx 
– All kernel objects memory are nonexecutable 
– The pool type of kernel object is assigned by 
ObCreateObjectType call in system booting process 
– Windows8 has assigned pool type of FileObject as 
NonPagedPoolNx 
27
          Apply Intel® SMEP Technology  
– The defense situation of known SMEP attack trick in Windows8
