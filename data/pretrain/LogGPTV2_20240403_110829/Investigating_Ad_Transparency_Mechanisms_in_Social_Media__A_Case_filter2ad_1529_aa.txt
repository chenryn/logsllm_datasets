Abstract—Targeted advertising has been subject to many
privacy complaints from both users and policy makers. Despite
this attention, users still have little understanding of what data the
advertising platforms have about them and why they are shown
particular ads. To address such concerns, Facebook recently
introduced two transparency mechanisms: a “Why am I seeing
this?” button that provides users with an explanation of why
they were shown a particular ad (ad explanations), and an Ad
Preferences Page that provides users with a list of attributes
Facebook has inferred about them and how (data explanations).
In this paper, we investigate the level of transparency provided
by these two mechanisms. We ﬁrst deﬁne a number of key
properties of explanations and then evaluate empirically whether
Facebook’s explanations satisfy them. For our experiments, we
develop a browser extension that collects the ads users receive
every time they browse Facebook, their respective explanations,
and the attributes listed on the Ad Preferences Page; we then use
controlled experiments where we create our own ad campaigns
and target the users that installed our extension. Our results show
that ad explanations are often incomplete and sometimes mis-
leading while data explanations are often incomplete and vague.
Taken together, our ﬁndings have signiﬁcant implications for
users, policy makers, and regulators as social media advertising
services mature.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, targeted advertising has become the source
of a growing number of privacy concerns for internet users.
At the heart of the problem lies the opacity of the targeted
advertising mechanisms: users do not understand what data
advertising platforms have about them and how this data is
being used for ad targeting (i.e., to select the ads that they are
shown). This resulting lack of transparency has begun to catch
the attention of policy makers and government regulators, who
are increasingly introducing laws requiring transparency. For

example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of
the EU establishes a “right to explanations” [9], [26], and the
Loi pour une R´epublique Num´erique of France strengthens the
transparency requirements for digital platforms [10].
While many prior studies have focused on bringing trans-
parency to targeted advertising on the web [17], [34], [30],
[31], [20], [36], [43], few studies (if any) have focused on
social media advertising. Targeting ads on social media differs
from traditional ad targeting in multiple important ways: First,
social media platforms such as Facebook have access to much
richer data sources than traditional advertising companies such
as DoubleClick (e.g., Facebook has information about the con-
tent people are posting, their self-reported demographics, the
identities of their friends, web browsing traces, etc). Second,
social media platforms know detailed personally-identiﬁable
information (PII) of users, and they often allow advertisers
to target users based on this information. In comparison,
traditional advertisers often only track user browsing behaviors
via opaque cookies. As social media sites are now the de-facto
portal to the web for many users, bringing transparency to
social media advertising is a signiﬁcant concern.
In response to users’ and regulators’ concerns, social media
platforms recently started offering transparency mechanisms.
In particular, Facebook was the ﬁrst to do so by introducing
two features. First, Facebook introduced a “Why am I seeing
this?” button that provides users with an explanation for why
they have been targeted with a particular ad. Second, Facebook
added an Ad Preferences Page that provides users with an
explanation for what information Facebook has inferred about
them, how Facebook inferred it, and what information is used
for targeting them with advertisements. However, to the best
of our knowledge, there has been little examination of these
two transparency mechanisms; such a study is all the more
important because other social media sites such as Twitter have
recently begun introducing similar transparency mechanisms.
In this paper, we take a ﬁrst step towards exploring the
transparency mechanisms provided by social media sites, fo-
cusing on the explanations that Facebook provides. However,
constructing explanations for social media advertising is a
challenging problem as ad impressions are the result of a
number of complex processes within Facebook, as well as
of interactions between multiple advertisers and Facebook’s
advertising platform. Here, we narrow our study to the two pro-
cesses for which Facebook provides transparency mechanisms:
the process of how Facebook infers data about users, and the
process of how advertisers use this data to target users. We
call explanations about those two processes data explanations
and ad explanations, respectively.
Constructing an explanation involves a number of design
choices, ranging from the phrasing, to the length, and to the
amount of detail provided. As a consequence, what would
constitute a good explanation is an ill-deﬁned question, as
it depends heavily on what the purpose of the explanation
is. For instance, explanations can serve to improve the trust
placed by users in the site, or simply to satisfy their curiosity
in order to enhance the service’s utility. Explanations can
also be seen as a tool to allow users to control the outcome
of the ad targeting system (e.g., the ads they receive), or
as a tool for regulators1 to verify compliance with certain
rules (e.g., non-discrimination), or even as a tool for users
to detect malicious or deceptive targeting behavior. Different
purposes might impose different design choices: for instance,
verifying non-discrimination might necessitate an exhaustive
list of all targeting attributes used, while such a list may be
overwhelming for end users who are simply curious.
We do not attempt to arbitrate on what would be a good
explanation. Instead, we identify a number of properties that
are key for different types of explanations aimed at bringing
transparency to social media advertising. We then evaluate
empirically how well Facebook’s explanations satisfy these
properties and discuss the implications of our ﬁndings in view
of the possible purposes of explanations. Speciﬁcally, after
providing a detailed account of the different processes involved
in Facebook’s advertising and the data about users they make
available to advertisers (Section II),
this paper makes the
following contributions:
(i) We investigate ad explanations (Section III), i.e., explana-
tions of the ad targeting process. We deﬁne ﬁve key properties
of the explanations: personalization, completeness, correctness
(and the companion property of misleadingness), consistency,
and determinism. To analyze the explanations Facebook pro-
vides, we build a Chrome browser extension that collects all
the ads users receive, along with the explanations provided for
the ads, every time the users browse Facebook. We deploy
this extension and collect 26,173 ads and corresponding ex-
planations from 35 users. To study how well Facebook’s ad
explanations satisfy our ﬁve properties, we conduct controlled
ad campaigns targeting users who installed the browser ex-
tension, and compare the explanation to the actual targeting
parameters we deﬁned in the campaign.2
Our experiments show that Facebook’s ad explanations are of-
ten incomplete and sometimes misleading. We observe that at
most one (out of the several attributes we targeted users with) is
provided in the explanation. The choice of the attribute shown
depends deterministically on the type of the attribute (e.g.,
demographic-, behavior-, or interest-based) and its rarity (i.e.,

such as the French “loi pour une R´epublique Num´erique”.

Institutional Review Boards.
how many Facebook users have a particular attribute). The way
Facebook’s ad explanations appear to be built—showing only
the most prevalent attribute—may allow malicious advertisers
to easily obfuscate ad explanations from ad campaigns that
are discriminatory or that target privacy-sensitive attributes.
Our experiments also show that Facebook’s ad explanations
sometimes suggest that attributes that were never speciﬁed by
the advertiser “may” have been selected, which makes these
explanations potentially misleading to end users about what
the advertiser’s targeting parameters were.
(ii) We investigate data explanations (Section IV), i.e., explana-
tions of the data inferred about a user. We deﬁne four key prop-
erties of the explanations: speciﬁcity, snapshot completeness,
temporal completeness, and correctness. To evaluate Face-
book’s explanations, we crawl the Facebook Ad Preferences
Page for each user daily using the browser extension, and we
conduct controlled ad campaigns that target attributes that are
not present in the Ad Preferences Page. Our analysis shows that
the data provided on the Ad Preferences Page is incomplete and
often vague. For example, the Ad Preferences Page provides
no information about data obtained from data brokers, and
often does not specify which action a user took that lead to an
attribute being inferred. Consequently, users have little insight
over how to avoid potentially sensitive attributes from being
inferred.
Overall, our study is a ﬁrst step towards better understand-
ing and improving transparency in social media advertising.
While we do not claim that
the properties that we have
identiﬁed form an exhaustive list, we hope that our work will
spur further interest from researchers and social media sites to
investigate how to improve transparency mechanisms.
II. ADVERTISING ON FACEBOOK
Before evaluating the explanations provided by Facebook, we
ﬁrst explore the different processes that are involved when a
user is shown an ad, as well as the ad targeting parameters
Facebook makes available to advertisers. This information is
useful as a reference for evaluating the explanations provided
by Facebook and understanding their impact, and for under-
standing what are the different components we ideally would
like to make transparent.
We ﬁrst separate out the different processes that are re-
sponsible for a user receiving an ad, then brieﬂy describe
how advertisers can place ads using Facebook’s advertising
interface, and ﬁnally analyze the various targeting methods
available to advertisers by studying what data about users is
used by each.
A. The processes responsible for receiving an ad
The central goal of our paper is to analyze Facebook’s
answers to the question Why am I being shown this ad? The
reason why a user received a particular ad is, however, the
result of a complex process that depends on many inputs.
To enumerate just a few, it depends on: what the platform
thinks the user is interested in, the characteristics of users
the advertiser wants to reach, the set of advertisers and the
parameters of their campaigns, the bid prices of all advertisers,
the active users on the platform at a particular time, and
2
(2) The audience selection process is the interface that allows
advertisers to express who should receive their ads. Advertisers
create audiences by specifying the set of targeting attributes
the audience needs to satisfy (see Figure 1b; more details in
Section II-C). Later, to launch an ad campaign, advertisers also
need to specify a bid price and an optimization criterion (e.g.,
“Reach” or “Conversions”, that specify to Facebook what the
advertiser’s goal is).
(3) The user-ad matching process takes place whenever some-
one is eligible to see an ad [2]. It examines all the ad campaigns
placed by different advertisers in a particular time interval,
their bids, and runs an auction to determine which ads are
selected (see Figure 1c).
An explanation for the data inference process or the au-
dience selection process can provide information about any
of the the three components: the inputs, the outputs, or the
mapping function. Explanations of the advertising platform
matching process are, however, much more complex as the
outcome not only depends on the advertising platform and its
complex matching algorithm, but also on all the competing
advertisers and their corresponding requests as well as all the
available users on the platform. In this paper, we focus on
explanations of the ﬁrst two processes, and we refer to them as
data explanations and ad explanations respectively. We leave
explanations of the advertising platform matching process for
future work. Nevertheless, only explaining the data inference
and advertising selection process simpliﬁes the design of
explanations while keeping the explanation informative for the
user. Note that while data explanations provide information
about the decisions of the advertising platform, ad explanations
provide information about the decisions of the advertiser. Thus,
the set of properties and concerns is different for the two.

(b) The audience selection process
(c) The user-ad matching process

B. Placing ads on Facebook
the algorithm used to match ads to users. Theoretically, an
explanation could provide information about all these complex
processes, however, it would be very challenging to do so
without overwhelming users.
In this section, we attempt to simplify the task by sep-
arating the different processes that are responsible for a user
receiving an ad. In social media advertising we can distinguish
three responsible components:
(1) The data inference process is the process that allows the
advertising platform to learn the users’ attributes. We can
model this process as having three parts (see Figure 1a): (a)
the raw user data (the inputs), containing the information the
advertising platform collects about a user either online (e.g.,
pages liked, web browsing activity, uploaded proﬁle informa-
tion, etc) or ofﬂine (e.g., data obtained from data brokers); (b)
the data inference algorithm (the mapping function between
inputs and outputs), covering the algorithm the advertising
platform uses to translate input user data to targeting attributes;
and (c) the resulting targeting attributes (the outputs) of each
user that advertisers can specify to select different groups of
users.
Facebook’s advertiser interface allows advertisers to create
targeting audiences—predeﬁned sets of users that match vari-
ous criteria (i.e., that have certain attributes)—and then place
ads that will only be seen by users in a particular audience
(see Figure 2). The interface allows advertisers to choose the
location, age range, gender, and the language of users they
wish to target. Additionally, advertisers can browse through a
list of predeﬁned targeting attributes that can be demographic-,
interest-, or behavior-based to further reﬁne their audiences.
In addition to this traditional form of audience selection
based on targeting attributes, Facebook introduced a new
feature called custom audiences in 2012 [18]. In brief, custom
audiences allow advertisers to upload a list of PII—including
email addresses, or phone numbers, or names along with
ZIP codes—of users who they wish to reach on Facebook.3
Facebook then creates an audience containing only the users
who match the uploaded PII.
C. Targeting methods and available data
While there are many ways to target users as described
above, we choose to analyze targeting on Facebook through
3Other social media sites such as Twitter, Google, Pinterest or LinkedIn
also provide similar features.
