### MSMQ Message Backup and Restore Utility (mqbkup)

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `mqbkup` utility is designed to back up Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) message files and registry settings to a storage device. It can also restore previously backed-up messages and settings. Both the backup and restore operations temporarily stop the local MSMQ service. If the service was running before the operation, the utility will attempt to restart it afterward. If the service was already stopped, no attempt to restart it will be made.

**Prerequisites:**
Before using the `mqbkup` utility, ensure that all local applications using MSMQ are closed.

**Syntax:**
```shell
mqbkup {/b | /r} <path>
```

**Parameters:**
- **/b**: Specifies a backup operation.
- **/r**: Specifies a restore operation.
- **<path>**: The path where the MSMQ message files and registry settings will be stored or retrieved from.
- **/?**: Displays help information at the command prompt.

**Remarks:**
- If the specified folder does not exist, the utility will automatically create it.
- If an existing folder is specified, it must be empty. If the folder is not empty, the utility will prompt you to confirm the deletion of all files and subfolders within it. You can use the `/y` parameter to automatically agree to the deletion.
- The utility restores MSMQ message files to the folders specified in the registry, not to the original storage folders used during the backup.

**Examples:**
1. **Backup Example:**
   To back up all MSMQ message files and registry settings to the `msmqbkup` folder on your C: drive, type:
   ```shell
   mqbkup /b c:\msmqbkup
   ```

2. **Backup with Deletion Confirmation:**
   To delete all existing files and subfolders in the `oldbkup` folder on your C: drive and then store MSMQ message files and registry settings in the folder, type:
   ```shell
   mqbkup /b /y c:\oldbkup
   ```

3. **Restore Example:**
   To restore MSMQ messages and registry settings from the `msmqbkup` folder on your C: drive, type:
   ```shell
   mqbkup /r c:\msmqbkup
   ```

By following these guidelines, you can effectively use the `mqbkup` utility to manage your MSMQ message files and registry settings.
