data (§4.1). Our results show that churn can increase the
amount of compromised Tor circuits by up to 50% over
a period of one month. We then conﬁrmed our results by
performing targeted data-plane measurements on the Tor
network (§4.2). Again, churn signiﬁcantly increased the
percentage of vulnerable Tor circuits, nearly tripling it.
4.1 Control-plane Evaluation
We quantiﬁed the impact of churn by measuring how it
increased the probability of a single AS (say AS X) to
end up simultaneously on the path between a client and
a guard relay and on the path between a destination and
an exit relay. When this happens, we considered AS X
as (potentially) compromising for the pair (client, desti-
nation) using the corresponding Tor circuit. Observe that
our analysis leverages asymmetric trafﬁc analysis (§3) as
it only requires X to be on-path for two publicly-known
preﬁxes, covering the guard and the exit relay.
Datasets We collected 612+ million BGP updates per-
taining to 550,000 IP preﬁxes collected by six RIPE-
maintained BGP Looking Glass (rrc00, rrc01, rrc03,
rrc04, rrc11, rrc14) [6] in January 2015 over 250+ BGP
sessions. We processed the dataset to remove any arti-
facts caused by session resets [20]. In parallel, we also
collected Tor-related data (IP address, ﬂags and band-
width) of about 6755 Tor relays active during the same
period of time [4]. Among all Tor relays, 1459 (resp.
1182) of them were listed as guards (resp. exits) and 338
relays were listed as both guard and exit.
We considered each BGP session as a proxy for Tor
clients and destinations. Note that analysis implicitly ac-
counts for any Internet host reachable directly or indi-
rectly through these BGP sessions. Our dataset contains
sessions belonging to major Internet transit providers
such as Level-3, ATT, NTT, etc.
that provide transit to
millions of hosts.
Static baseline. We computed a static baseline by con-
sidering the amount of compromising ASes at the be-
ginning of our dataset, without considering any updates.
On each BGP session si, we computed and maintained
the routing table used to forward Tor trafﬁc by consid-
ering all the BGP announcements and withdrawals re-
ceived over si. More precisely, we kept track of the most-
speciﬁc routing table entry that was used to forward traf-
ﬁc to any Tor guard or exit relays. We refer to those as
Tor preﬁxes. In this context, a routing table entry for a
relay r is a ﬁve-tuple (ti,t f , p,e,L) composed of: i) the
initial time ti at which the entry started to be used by
the router for forwarding trafﬁc to r; ii) the ﬁnal time t f
at which the entry stopped to be used by the router; iii)
the corresponding IP preﬁx p; iv) a boolean e denoting
whether the r is an entry or an exit relay; and v) the list
of all the ASes L that will see the trafﬁc en-route to reach
r (i.e., the AS-PATH).

Figure 7: Control-plane evaluation setup
Using the routing-table data, we accounted, for each
AS X, the number of pairs ((si, gi), (s j, e j)) for which it
appeared simultaneously in the AS-PATH. Here, si (resp.
s j) refers to a client (resp. destination) session, while gi
(resp. e j) refers to a Tor guard (resp. exit) relay. To
ensure meaningful results, we only considered cases in

which si and s j are in different ASes to ensure enough
diversity in the paths seen. As illustration, in Fig. 7,
ASX is a compromising AS for the pair ((s1, g1), (s2,
e2)), meaning it can deanonymize any clients connected
beyond s1 and exchanging data with a destination con-
nected beyond s2 which uses g1 (resp. e2) as a guard
(resp. exit) relay.

(b) Churn-induced increase
Figure 8: Without considering churn, more than 5% of
all the possible Tor circuits are compromised by at least
one AS in 20% of the cases (left). The amount of com-
promised circuits increase for the majority of the (src,
dest) pairs (60%) when considering churn, by up to 50%
in 20% of the cases (right).
Fig. 8a depicts the percentage of compromised Tor cir-
cuits for each source and destination as a Complemen-
tary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF). A point
(x,y) on the curve means that x% of all Tor circuits, i.e.
(guard,exit) pairs, are compromised for at least y%
of all the (src,dst) pairs. We see that, for 50% of all
the (src,dst) pairs, at least 0.75% of the Tor circuits
are compromised by at least one AS. This number grows
to 6% and 13% of the Tor circuits considering the 75th-
and 95th-percentile, respectively.
Measuring the effect of churn. We computed the num-
ber of extra Tor circuits that got compromised by at least
one AS over one month. To be fair, we only considered a
Tor circuit as compromised if it crossed the same AS for
at least 30 seconds as it is unlikely that a time-correlation
attack can be performed in shorter timescale. Fig. 8b
plots the ratio between the amount of compromised Tor
circuits for each (src,dst) pair at the end of the month
with respect to the static baseline amount. We see that
churn signiﬁcantly increases the probability of compro-
mise.
Indeed, the amount of compromised circuits in-
crease for 60% of the (src,dst). The increase reaches
50% (ratio of 1.5) in 20% of the cases.
In addition to increasing the number of compro-
mised Tor circuits, churn also increases the number of
compromisable (src,dst) pairs.
Indeed, while 5593
(src,dst) pairs could be compromised without up-
dates, that number increased to 5754 pairs when consid-
ering updates (an augmentation of nearly 3%).

jority of the Tor circuits. Due to their central position
in the Internet, a few ASes naturally tend to see a lot of
Tor trafﬁc crossing them. To account for this effect, we
compute how many Tor circuits crossed each AS from
at least one (src,dst) pair. The top 10 ASes in terms
of compromised circuits are listed in Table 4. Large net-
works such as NTT or Level3 are able to see Tor trafﬁc
for up to 90% of Tor circuits.
4.2 Data-plane Evaluation
Next, we aim to quantify the impact of churn using data-
plane information collected via traceroute.
Datasets We ran traceroute between 70 RIPE Atlas
probes [5] to measure the actual forwarding path taken
by packets entering and exiting the Tor network. We se-
lected one probe in 70 different ASes, split in the follow-
ing four sets:
• S1 : 10 ASes that contain the most Tor clients [35];
• S2 : 25 ASes that cumulatively contained ∼50% of all
• S3 : 25 ASes that cumulatively contained ∼50% of all
• S4 : 10 ASes that contain the most Tor destina-
guard relay bandwidth;
exit relay bandwidth;
tions [35].
We then ran daily traceroutes over a 3 weeks period be-
tween all probes in S1 towards all probes in S2 (and vice-
versa), measuring the forwarding paths P1 between Tor
clients and guard relays, and the paths P2 between guard
relays and Tor clients. Similarly, we measured the for-
warding paths P3 between exit relays and Tor destina-
tions, and the paths P4 between Tor destinations and exit
relays. Overall, we measured 10×25×25×10 = 62500
possible Tor circuits.
Churn nearly tripled the amount of vulnerable Tor
circuits. If we use conventional methodology and only
look for common ASes between P1 and P3, we found
12.8% of Tor circuits to be vulnerable on the ﬁrst day
of the experiment (red line in Fig. 9).
