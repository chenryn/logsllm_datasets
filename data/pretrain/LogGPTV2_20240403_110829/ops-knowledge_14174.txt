User: My apologies if this has already been asked and answered.  I don't know enough about eclipse & pydev setup to know what to search for.
I'd like to use pydev, but can't modify the existing installation of eclipse.  Do I need to install my own eclipse so that I can then install pydev into it, or is there a way to install pydev off to the side such that I can then use it with the existing eclipse?
Assistant: The best solution I found was multiple installations: eclipse is not that big (~250mb I think), but it's quite slow, so you'll want to have as little plugins as possible.
