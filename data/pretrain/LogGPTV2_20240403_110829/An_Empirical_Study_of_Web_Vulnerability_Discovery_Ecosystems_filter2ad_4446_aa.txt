ABSTRACT
In recent years, many organizations have established bounty
programs that attract white hat hackers who contribute vul-
nerability reports of web systems. In this paper, we collect
publicly available data of two representative web vulnera-
bility discovery ecosystems (Wooyun and HackerOne) and
study their characteristics, trajectory, and impact. We ﬁnd
that both ecosystems include large and continuously grow-
ing white hat communities which have provided signiﬁcant
contributions to organizations from a wide range of business
sectors. We also analyze vulnerability trends, response and
resolve behaviors, and reward structures of participating or-
ganizations. Our analysis based on the HackerOne dataset
reveals that a considerable number of organizations exhibit
decreasing trends for reported web vulnerabilities. We fur-
ther conduct a regression study which shows that monetary
incentives have a signiﬁcantly positive correlation with the
number of vulnerabilities reported. Finally, we make recom-
mendations aimed at increasing participation by white hats
and organizations in such ecosystems.

INTRODUCTION
Websites are critical pathways to facilitate e-commerce,
customer service, input procurement, and employee connec-
tivity, and they continue to reach signiﬁcant penetration in
various business sectors. Most large businesses are hosting
web services, and over 50% of small businesses are now oﬀer-
ing web accessibility [10]. As such, web security has become
critically important for most organizations, and the preven-
tion of security compromises enabled by web vulnerabili-
ties is gaining increasingly the attention of company lead-
ership and the broader security community. Nevertheless,
web vulnerabilities are the likely causes of many recent se-

curity breaches contributing to massive disclosure of user
data, leakage of business information, and other losses.
To reduce the number of web vulnerabilities, organizations
can use automated web vulnerability scanners which how-
ever have been shown to only have limited coverage [16, 37].
In response, organizations more recently started to directly
collaborate with or indirectly beneﬁt from outside security
researchers. These so-called white hat researchers spend
time to analyze organizations’ web systems and report vul-
nerabilities to self-run bug bounty programs of organizations
such as Facebook, Github and PayPal, or to correspond-
ing programs on third-party bug bounty platforms such as
Wooyun, HackerOne, BugCrowd, Cobalt, etc.
White hats contribute in many positive ways to the discov-
ery of web vulnerabilities. First, they can complement the
limitations of automated scanners [16] by reaching deeper
states of web applications, and may better understand the
application logic. Second, with a mindset comparable to
attackers, white hats are good at ﬁnding many exploitable
vulnerabilities of high severity. Third, the large and diverse
group of potential white hat contributors outnumbers inter-
nal security teams or penetration testing teams and could
therefore cover a wider range of security issues.
White hats’ considerable eﬀorts are rewarded in diﬀer-
ent ways. Organizations or bug bounty platforms may pro-
vide monetary incentives based on severity and originality of
the discovered issue, or publicize white hats’ contributions
to enhance their reputations. Previous studies and reports
have shown that the cost of utilizing the white hat commu-
nity may be lower compared with hiring internal security
researchers [20] or using services from penetration testing
companies [5].
The resulting interactions extend beyond organizational
boundaries and form web vulnerability discovery ecosystems
including businesses/organizations, white hats, and third-
party vulnerability disclosure reward/bounty programs (Fig-
ure 1). These ecosystems have been growing rapidly and are
becoming more prominent in the battle against malicious ac-
tors on the Internet. However, detailed studies of these web
vulnerability ecosystems to understand their characteristics,
trajectories, and impact are notably absent.
In this work, we conduct the ﬁrst empirical study of two
major web vulnerability discovery ecosystems. We base our
analyses on publicly available data. The ﬁrst dataset is col-
lected from Wooyun1, the predominant and likely the oldest
web vulnerability discovery ecosystem in China. Our data
contains 64,134 vulnerabilities aﬀecting a total of 17,328 or-

are highlighted. Numbers were obtained from the cited references, or platforms’ websites directly in early August of 2015.

ganizations including almost all popular Chinese web com-
panies. We additionally collect publicly available data from
HackerOne2, a US-based start-up company which hosts bug
bounty programs for hundreds of organizations, such as Ya-
hoo, Mail.ru and Twitter, from many parts of the world.
The Wooyun dataset is larger due to its coercive partici-
pation model for involving organizations, and also contains
more detailed vulnerability information due to its delayed
full disclosure policy. The HackerOne dataset is smaller
and not all of its reports can be accessed. However, it cov-
ers a diﬀerent set of organizations and also contains mone-
tary reward information that does not exist for the Wooyun
dataset. By combining these two complementary datasets,
we are able to explore a wide range of topics and gain a
better understanding of the structure and dynamics of such
ecosystems and their impact on Internet security. We antic-
ipate that our study will be a valuable reference for organi-
zations who want to create or optimize their existing bounty
programs.
We make the following contributions:
• Our analysis shows how many white hats have been
attracted by these ecosystems and how the number
of contributing white hats evolves over time. We fur-
ther assess their diversity in terms of productivity and
breadth of vulnerability discovery (e.g., types of vul-
nerabilities and aﬀected organizations) by studying in-
dividual contributions but also contributions by groups
of white hats with high/medium/low productivity. We
also analyze the potential (learning) value of disclosing
vulnerabilities to the white hat community.
• We then quantitatively analyze participating organi-
zations from several dimensions, including the vulner-
ability trends, the coverage of diﬀerent business sec-
tors, the response and resolve behaviors, and reward
structures. We evaluate the trend of reported vulner-
abilities for representative organizations.
• Our study further measures the impact of diﬀerent

2. RELATED WORK
2.1 Software Vulnerability Datasets
Previous work has studied various software vulnerabil-
ity datasets to understand vulnerability discovery, patching
and exploitation. This research is relevant for the debate
on whether vulnerability disclosure programs are beneﬁcial
to society [18]. That is, if the number of potential vulner-
abilities is large with respect to the eﬀort of white hats,
and vulnerabilities are found in no particular order, then
black hats could frequently discover and exploit vulnera-
bilities that are not covered by white hats’ contributions;
thereby questioning their eﬀectiveness. On the one hand,
Rescorla studied the ICAT dataset of 1,675 vulnerabilities
and found very weak or no evidence of vulnerability deple-
tion. He thus suggested that the vulnerability discovery ef-
forts might not provide much social beneﬁt [34]. On the
other hand, this conclusion is challenged by Ozment and
Schechter, who showed that the pool of vulnerabilities in
the foundational code of OpenBSD is being depleted with
strong statistical evidence [31, 32]. Ozment also found that
vulnerability rediscovery is common in the OpenBSD vul-
nerability discovery history [31]. Therefore, they gave the
opposite conclusion, i.e., vulnerability hunting by white hats
is socially beneﬁcial. More recently, Shahzad et al. [36] con-
ducted a large-scale study of the evolution of the vulnera-
bility life cycle using a combined dataset of NVD, OSVDB
and FVDB. Their study provided three positive signs for
increasing software security: (1) monthly vulnerability dis-
closures are decreasing since 2008, (2) exploitation diﬃculty
of the identiﬁed vulnerabilities is increasing, and (3) soft-
ware companies have become more agile in responding to
discovered vulnerabilities. In another study, Frei et al. stud-
ied a security ecosystem including discovers, vulnerability
markets, criminals, vendors, security information providers
and the public, based on 27,000 publicly disclosed vulnera-
bilities [21]. They focus on vulnerability exploits and patch-
ing of native software, while we study the ecosystem around
the discovery of web vulnerabilities, and our main focus are
the behaviors and dynamics of white hats and organizations
that compose such ecosystems.
2.2 Vulnerability Discoverers
Most of the existing research on software security focuses
on vulnerabilities, aﬀected software products or vulnerabil-
ity discovery tools. More recently, researchers started to pay
attention to the humans who make vulnerability discoveries.
Edmundson et al. conducted a code review experiment for
a small web application with 30 subjects [17]. One of their
ﬁndings is that none of the participants was able to ﬁnd
all 7 Web vulnerabilities embedded in the test code, but a
random sample of half of the participants could cover all vul-
nerabilities with a probability of about 95%, indicating that
a suﬃciently large group of white hats is required for ﬁnding
vulnerabilities eﬀectively. This is consistent with our anal-
ysis in Section 4.2.2 and Section 4.3.7. However, the code
review process they focused on is mainly conducted inside an
organization with source code available; while the vulnera-
bility hunting focused on in this paper is conducted outside
an organization. Finifter et al. provided contribution and
payment statistics of participants in Google Chrome VRP
and Mozilla Firefox VRP [20], and suggested that VRPs
are more cost-eﬀective compared to hiring full-time secu-
rity researchers. Previous work has also reported that many
discoverers primarily rely on their expertise and insights,
and limited types of tools such as fuzzers and debuggers,
