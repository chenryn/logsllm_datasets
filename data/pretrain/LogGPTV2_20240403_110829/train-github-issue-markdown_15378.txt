TL;DR: I propose we create a simple guard around doubly-including React, which
can cause issues if different blocks work with different instances of `React`.
I understand this invariant isn't going to matter to everyone, but I've at two
points in so many weeks fixed a bug on a co-worker's project because they were
accidentally including React twice in the browser: one from a Browserify
bundle, and once from a standalone ``.
