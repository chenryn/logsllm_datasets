### Analysis of Local Graphs and AS Dependency

Our analysis now focuses on the results obtained from local graphs, which, unlike global graphs, provide insights into AS (Autonomous System) dependency for a specific origin AS. We found that the structure of local graphs varies significantly based on the size and peering policies of the origin AS. On average in 2017, an IPv4 local graph contains 98 nodes, but 93% of these nodes have a hegemony score of zero (H = 0). Typically, ASes hosting BGP peers have a hegemony score of zero, and AS hegemony scores increase as paths converge towards the origin AS. Consequently, the upstream provider of a single-homed origin AS receives the maximum hegemony score, H = 1. By definition, the origin AS of each local graph also has H = 1, so we do not report the AS hegemony of the origin AS in the following results.

In 2017, local graphs typically have 5 ASes with H > 0.01, which usually correspond to a set of upstream providers and tier-1 ASes. We observed interesting cases where no dominant AS was present, as well as cases with numerous nodes having non-negligible AS hegemony scores. To illustrate this, we selected two local graphs: AS20940 from Akamai and AS15169 from Google.

#### Case Studies: Akamai and Google

**Akamai (AS20940):**
The IPv4 graph for Akamai’s main network, AS20940, is the local graph with the largest number of nodes in our results. In 2017, it contains an average of 30 nodes with an AS hegemony greater than 0.01 (see Fig. 5a). This indicates that accessing Akamai's IP space relies on a large set of transit networks, a trend consistent throughout our analysis period (Fig. 5a). Our manual inspection of Akamai's BGP announcements reveals that Akamai heavily fragments its IP space, advertising small prefixes at various Points of Presence (PoPs). As a result, each prefix is accessible only through a limited number of upstream providers, and all BGP peers report AS paths going through these providers. In summary, Akamai's local graph contains many nodes with weak but non-negligible AS hegemony scores, indicating numerous weak AS dependencies.

**Google (AS15169):**
The IPv4 graph for Google (AS15169) in 2017 contains no node with a hegemony score greater than 0.01 (see Fig. 5b). Our manual inspection of Google's BGP advertisements shows that, unlike Akamai, Google announces all their prefixes at each PoP. Due to Google's extensive peering, all BGP peers report very short and different AS paths with almost no common AS, resulting in no significant hegemony scores. However, Google's local graphs before 2012 show a different distribution with a few high AS hegemony scores (Fig. 5b). Level(3) was the most dominant AS until 2012, but Google has since reduced its dependency on Level(3), with H < 0.00005 from 2014. In summary, Google used to depend on a few ASes but is now mostly independent. This is not an isolated case; we observed no AS dependency for other ASes, including Microsoft (AS8075), Level(3) (AS3356), Hurricane Electric (HE, AS6939), and Verisign (AS7342).

**IPv6 Analysis:**
For IPv6, the situations for Akamai and Google differ. The local graph for Akamai contains many nodes with high AS hegemony (Fig. 5c). Hurricane Electric (HE) stands out with an AS hegemony (H = 0.43) close to the one observed in the IPv6 global graph (Fig. 3b). HE is also the dominant node in Google’s IPv6 local graph (Fig. 5d), but at a much lower magnitude (H = 0.12). This suggests that Google's aggressive peering policy has partially succeeded in bypassing HE's ubiquitous IPv6 network.

### DNS Root Servers

Monitoring AS dependency using our tools provides valuable insights, especially for networks hosting critical infrastructure. We present results for the local graphs of ASes hosting DNS root servers, focusing on the F-root (AS3557) and B-root (AS394353) servers due to significant structural changes in 2017.

**F-root (AS3557):**
In early 2017, three dominant transit ASes were observed for the network hosting the F-root server (Fig. 6a). AS30132 and AS1280 are direct upstream networks managed by ISC, the administrator of the F-root server. AS6939 (HE) is the main provider for AS1280 and is found in about a third of the AS paths toward the F-root server. From March 2017, Cloudflare (AS13335) started providing connectivity to new F-root instances [7]. This new infrastructure is clearly visible in our results, with Cloudflare's hegemony fluctuating around 0.2, diverting traffic from other instances. The addition of Cloudflare has successfully reduced F-root's dependency on other ASes.

**B-root (AS394353):**
For the B-root server (Fig. 6b), two dominant ASes, Los Nettos (AS226) and NTT America (AS2914), were observed in January and February 2017. Los Nettos reached H = 1 because the B-root server was unicasted, and Los Nettos was the sole provider. NTT also had a very high AS hegemony score, with over 80% of analyzed AS paths crossing NTT's network. From March 2017, two other transit nodes, AMPATH (AS20080) and HE (AS6939), were observed. A single /24 prefix was advertised with AMPATH as the first hop and HE as the second hop. This prefix is one of the two /24 prefixes advertised by the network hosting the B-root server but does not contain the server IP address. This suggests B-root operators were testing anycast in preparation for the deployment of the second instance of B-root at Miami in May [14]. In May, the deployment of the second instance hosted at AMPATH increased its hegemony, while Los Nettos' hegemony decreased. From July onward, however, AMPATH's hegemony suddenly decreased, and Los Nettos' hegemony returned close to 1. Manual comparison of AS paths in June and July revealed that Los Nettos tried to fix this by prepending its ASN to paths through HE. Despite these efforts, most paths transiting through HE and AMPATH in June were replaced by paths going through HE and Los Nettos in July. The addition of the second instance in Miami initially mitigated dependence on NTT and Los Nettos but later resulted in Los Nettos once again dominating B-root connectivity. For IPv6, higher hegemony values for AMPATH were observed after the deployment in Miami, confirmed by B-root operators.

### Future Directions

The structural changes observed for the F and B root servers highlight the value of AS hegemony in monitoring significant routing events. We are designing an automated detection process to identify significant changes in AS hegemony scores, which can detect sudden routing changes such as the recent BGP leak from Google [16]. This detector will report such events, which state-of-the-art tools often miss. Additionally, we plan to investigate different weighting schemes, such as assigning path weights based on traffic volume, to emphasize destinations favored by customers.

### Conclusions

We presented a methodology to quantify AS interdependency in the Internet, using BGP data to produce robust AS hegemony scores. Using 14 years of BGP data, we demonstrated that this method can monitor structural changes in the Internet and identify the most important ASes for reaching specific parts of the IP space. Our case studies showed the benefits of our tools in helping ISPs plan and assess infrastructure deployment. To assist network operators, we make our tools and results publicly available [1].
