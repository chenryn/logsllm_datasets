**Title: Botconf2017 - How to Compute the Clusterization of a Very Large Dataset of Malware Using Open Source Tools for Fun and Profit?**

Malware is now being developed on an industrial scale, making it increasingly challenging for human analysts to keep up. To address this, we present the results of our experiments aimed at clustering a very large set of malware using only static information, with the goal of classifying new malware samples.

Clustering involves grouping similar objects into meaningful categories, where objects within the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. These groups are referred to as clusters. When data are labeled, the problem is known as supervised clustering, which, although still challenging, is generally easier to solve compared to unsupervised clustering, where data are not labeled.

In our experiments, we used Python and primarily relied on the scikit-learn library. This means that you should be able to replicate our work with your own feature vectors. We will share our findings from a dataset of two million malware samples, including specific examples of the results we obtained. Additionally, we will discuss potential future research directions and the remaining challenges in this field.
