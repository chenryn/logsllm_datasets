 **Migrated issue, originally created by 0xANDREW NA (@0xANDREW)**
(SQLAlchemy 1.0.11)
Column definition in model:
`public_data = Column(MutableDict.as_mutable(JSON), nullable=False)`
Event listener in same model file:
    def __listener(target, value, oldvalue, initiator):
        ... do some stuff
    event.listen(User.public_data, 'set', __listener)
Change that should trigger `set` event:
    # this doesn't work
    user.public_data['address'] = ''
    # but this works
    user.public_data = {}
The event is never triggered when only a JSON attribute is modified. I stepped
through the SQLAlchemy code and found that after the first line above is
executed, the model's `changed()` method is called, which I assume should be
responsible for the event firing. Am I doing something wrong or is this not
supported?
