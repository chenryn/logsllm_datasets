I am experiencing an issue with Atom where the application updates successfully, but when I navigate to 'Help' > 'Release Notes', it displays an outdated version. The release notes page also includes active buttons for restarting and updating the application.

Here is a screenshot illustrating the problem:

I initially installed Atom 2-3 months ago, before the auto-updating feature was introduced, and I did not use Chocolatey for the installation. This could potentially be related to the issue. I have not yet attempted a complete uninstall and reinstallation of the application.

**System Information:**
- **Atom Version:** 0.174.0
- **Operating System:** Windows 8.1 64-bit

If you have any suggestions or need further information, please let me know.
