Atom is updating fine but 'Help' > 'Release Notes' gives me an old stale
version with an active restart and update button.

First time I installed Atom was 2-3 months ago before auto-updating was added
(direct, not through chocolatey) so that could potentially be a clue. Haven't
tried a complete nuke and re-install yet.
