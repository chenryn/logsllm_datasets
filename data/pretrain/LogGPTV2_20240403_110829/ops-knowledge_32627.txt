User: I installed eclipse with pydev plugin. I need to run my existing project on eclipse. But there are relative paths to the files inside my code. I expect from eclipse to append relative paths to the project's default directory. Instead, it appends the relative path to the directory where Eclipse is installed. I could not find a way to solve the problem.
Thanks in advance.
Assistant: Take a look in the project settings, I've never used Pydev with Eclipse, but you should be able to set where the project is executed at, or paths for references.
Of course there may be a better solution, but hopefully that's some help!
