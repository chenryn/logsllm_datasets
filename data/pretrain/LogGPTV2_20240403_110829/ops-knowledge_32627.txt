**User:**
I have installed Eclipse with the PyDev plugin and need to run an existing project within the IDE. However, my code contains relative file paths, and I expect Eclipse to resolve these relative paths based on the project's root directory. Instead, it is appending the relative paths to the directory where Eclipse is installed. I have not been able to find a solution to this issue.

**Assistant:**
Thank you for your detailed explanation. To address the issue of relative paths in your project, you can follow these steps:

1. **Check Project Settings:**
   - Right-click on your project in the Eclipse Project Explorer.
   - Select **Properties**.
   - Navigate to **PyDev - PYTHONPATH**.
   - Ensure that the source folders and libraries are correctly set up. The relative paths should be resolved based on the project's root directory.

2. **Set the Working Directory:**
   - Go to **Run > Run Configurations**.
   - Select the configuration for your Python application.
   - Under the **Arguments** tab, you can set the working directory. Set it to the root directory of your project (e.g., `${workspace_loc:/YourProjectName}`).

3. **Update Environment Variables:**
   - In the same **Run Configurations** dialog, go to the **Environment** tab.
   - You can add or modify environment variables to include the correct paths if necessary.

4. **Modify Code (if needed):**
   - If the above steps do not resolve the issue, you may need to adjust your code to use absolute paths or dynamically construct paths based on the project's root directory. For example:
     ```python
     import os
     project_root = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
     file_path = os.path.join(project_root, 'relative/path/to/your/file')
     ```

By following these steps, you should be able to ensure that Eclipse resolves the relative paths correctly based on your project's root directory. If you continue to experience issues, please provide more details about your project structure and any error messages you encounter, and I will be happy to assist further.
