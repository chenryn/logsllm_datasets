A few weeks ago on master I was able to use `factory` in my `_instanceof` Yaml
service declarations. This was useful because all instances of
DoctrineRepository need the same factory call. Without it, all
DoctrineRepositories have to duplicate the same factory line. The purpose of
`_instanceof` to reduce duplication would be better served if we could use
factory.
@nicolas-grekas I edited `DependencyInjection/Loader/YamlFileLoader` and added
`'factory' => 'factory'` to the `$instanceofKeywords` array and it seemed to
work. Any drawbacks? Better solutions?
