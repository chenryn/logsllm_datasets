User: I am new to Eclipse & PyDev (on Ubuntu 13.04) and want to try Python3.3 programming.
But I cannot choose python3.3 iterpreter, - I try to choose it in usr\lib\python3.3 , but:
- when I try to choose PYTHONPATH by clicking "New folder" - window doesn't open (I can do it onl after choosing auto-config, which will add python2.7 pates);
- I don't know the file in usr\lib\python3.3, which I need to choose, as python3.3 interpreter (auto-config returns me only 2.7 objects).
Can you advice me how to choose python3.3 interpreter (maybe the main is the file\path I need to choose in " usr\lib\python3.3" as interpreter file - in windows Eclipse I see python3.3.exe, - I need to find its equal in Ubuntu I think)?
Thanks!
Assistant: You set the path usr\lib\python3.3 by typing it directly in the 'Interpreter Executable' field! You don't have to search for the Interpreter file. This will do the Auto Config for you. Afterwards you declare a name and you're done.
