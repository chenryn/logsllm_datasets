**Subject: Configuring Python 3.3 Interpreter in Eclipse with PyDev on Ubuntu 13.04**

I am new to using Eclipse and PyDev on Ubuntu 13.04 and would like to start programming with Python 3.3. However, I am encountering difficulties in setting up the Python 3.3 interpreter.

When I attempt to configure the interpreter, I navigate to `/usr/lib/python3.3`, but I face the following issues:
- When I try to add a folder to the PYTHONPATH by clicking "New Folder," the window does not open. This only works after I choose the auto-configuration option, which then adds paths for Python 2.7.
- I am unsure which file within `/usr/lib/python3.3` I should select as the Python 3.3 interpreter. The auto-configuration only returns Python 2.7 objects.

Could you please advise me on how to correctly set up the Python 3.3 interpreter? Specifically, I need to know the correct file or path to use in `/usr/lib/python3.3` as the interpreter. In Windows, I see `python3.3.exe`, so I assume there is an equivalent in Ubuntu.

Thank you!

**Response:**

To set up the Python 3.3 interpreter in Eclipse with PyDev on Ubuntu, follow these steps:

1. Open Eclipse and go to **Window > PyDev > Interpreters > Python Interpreter**.
2. Click on the **New...** button to add a new interpreter.
3. In the **Interpreter Executable** field, type the path to the Python 3.3 executable directly. For Ubuntu, this is typically `/usr/bin/python3.3`.
4. Click **OK** to proceed. The auto-configuration process will then detect the necessary paths and libraries.
5. Give the interpreter a name (e.g., "Python 3.3") and click **Finish**.

This should successfully set up the Python 3.3 interpreter in your Eclipse environment.
