User: What are the differences between a virtual machine and a container? When would you choose one over the other?
Assistant: Virtual Machine:
- A virtual machine is an emulation of a computer system that enables multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine.
- Each VM has its own virtual hardware (CPU, memory, storage) and runs a complete operating system.
- A VM can run different types of applications and processes.
- Each VM requires its own operating system, which takes up more storage space and has more overhead.
When to choose VM:
- Need to run applications that require different operating systems.
- Need to run a full operating system with its own kernel.
- Need to run applications that require a significant amount of isolation from the host environment.

Container:
- A container is a set of processes that are isolated and run on top of a single host OS.
- Containers share the host's operating system kernel and use the host's resources to run applications.
- Containers do not require their own operating system, which reduces the overhead and makes them more lightweight.
- Containers are faster to start up and scale, and offer better performance than VMs.
When to choose container:
- Need to run applications that share the same host OS.
- Need to isolate applications from each other.
- Need to deploy and scale applications quickly and efficiently.
