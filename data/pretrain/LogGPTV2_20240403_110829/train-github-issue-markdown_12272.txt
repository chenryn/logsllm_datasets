I would like to know if it is possible to mix validation group and group
sequence ?
I used GroupSequence like this :
     * @Assert\GroupSequence({"Branch", "Step2"})
     * @ProjectAssert\Configuration(groups={"Step2"})
     */
    class Branch
        // some property with validator.
        // and
        /**
         * @SensioAssert\Yaml() 
         */
        private $configurationVariables;
        /**
         * @SensioAssert\Twig()
         */
        private $configurationTemplate;
And it works like a charm.
But now, I want to preview the branch configuration. So I **do not need**
validate everything. I just want to validate `configurationVariables` and
`configurationTemplate` in a first step, and then the whole configuration with
`ProjectAssert\Configuration` in a second step.
So I added `groups={"preview"}` on `configurationVariables` and
`configurationTemplate`.  
But I do not know how to add a group on my validation sequence.  
AFAIK, a POPO can attach only one GroupSequence, and a GroupSequence can not
be inside a group.
