I would like to know if it is possible to combine validation groups with group sequences.

Currently, I am using `GroupSequence` as follows:

```php
/**
 * @Assert\GroupSequence({"Branch", "Step2"})
 * @ProjectAssert\Configuration(groups={"Step2"})
 */
class Branch
{
    // Some properties with validators.
    
    /**
     * @SensioAssert\Yaml()
     */
    private $configurationVariables;

    /**
     * @SensioAssert\Twig()
     */
    private $configurationTemplate;
}
```

This setup works perfectly. However, I now need to preview the branch configuration. For this, I do not need to validate everything. Instead, I want to validate only `configurationVariables` and `configurationTemplate` in the first step, and then validate the entire configuration with `ProjectAssert\Configuration` in the second step.

To achieve this, I added `groups={"preview"}` to `configurationVariables` and `configurationTemplate`. 

However, I am unsure how to incorporate this new group into my validation sequence. As far as I know, a Plain Old PHP Object (POPO) can only have one `GroupSequence`, and a `GroupSequence` cannot be nested within a group.

How can I achieve this validation flow?
