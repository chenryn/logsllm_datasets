NOTE: Whenever a MIP is configured and a bridge domain is mapped to multiple maintenance
domains or maintenance associations, it is essential that the mip-half-function value for all
maintenance domains and maintenance associations be the same.
To display MIP configurations, use the show oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management mip (bridge-domain |
instance-name | interface-name) command.
32
The following MIP configurations are supported in ACX5048 and ACX5096 routers:
• MIP with with bridge domain
• MIP with circuit cross-connect (CCC)
• MIP with bridge domain when maintenance association end point is configured
• MIP with CCC when maintenance association end point is configured
The following sections describe MIP configuration:
Configure the Maintenance Domain Bridge Domain
To configure the bridge domain, include the vlans statement at the [edit protocols oam ethernet
connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain maintenance-domain-name] hierarchy level.
NOTE: The Layer 2 CLI configurations and show commands for ACX5048 and ACX5096 routers
differ compared to other ACX Series routers. For more information, see Layer 2 Next Generation
Mode for ACX Series.
Configure the Maintenance Domain MIP Half Function
MIP Half Function (MHF) divides MIP functionality into two unidirectional segments, improves visibility
with minimal configuration, and improves network coverage by increasing the number of points that can
be monitored. MHF extends monitoring capability by responding to loopback and linktrace messages to
help isolate faults.
Whenever a MIP is configured and a bridge domain is mapped to multiple maintenance domains or
maintenance associations, it is essential that the MIP half function value for all maintenance domains
and maintenance associations be the same. To configure the MIP half function, include the mip-half-
function statement at the [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain
maintenance-domain-name] hierarchy level.
Configure the Maintenance Association Intermediate Points with Bridge Domain
In ACX5048 and ACX5096 routers, you can configure the MIP with bridge domain. The following is a
sample to configure the MIP with bridge domain:
[edit protocols]
oam {
ethernet {
33
connectivity-fault-management {
maintenance-domain default-6 {
vlan bd1;
mip-half-function default;
}
}
}
}
Configure the Maintenance Association Intermediate Points with Circuit Cross-Connect
In ACX5048 and ACX5096 routers, you can configure the MIP with circuit cross-connect (CCC). The
following is a sample to configure the MIP with CCC:
[edit protocols]
oam {
ethernet {
connectivity-fault-management {
maintenance-domain default-6 {
interface xe-0/0/42.0;
mip-half-function default;
}
}
}
}
Configure the Maintenance Association Intermediate Points with Bridge Domain when Maintenance
Association End Point is Configured
In ACX5048 and ACX5096 routers, you can configure the MIP with bridge domain when a maintenance
association end point (MEP) is configured. The following is a sample to configure the MIP with bridge
domain when MEP is configured:
[edit protocols]
oam {
ethernet {
connectivity-fault-management {
maintenance-domain md2 {
level 5;
mip-half-function default;

}
}
}
}
}
}
Configure the Maintenance Intermediate Points with Circuit Cross-Connect when Maintenance
Association End Point is Configured
In ACX5048 and ACX5096 routers, you can configure the MIP with circuit cross-connect (CCC) when a
maintenance association end point (MEP) is configured. The following is a sample to configure the MIP
with CCC when MEP is configured:

Configure a MEP to Generate and Respond to CFM Protocol Messages
IN THIS SECTION
Configure a Maintenance Association End Point (MEP) | 36
Configure a Remote Maintenance Association End Point (MEP) | 38
A maintenance association end point (MEP) refers to the boundary of a domain. A MEP generates and
responds to connectivity fault management (CFM) protocol messages. You can configure multiple up
MEPs for a single combination of maintenance association ID and maintenance domain ID for interfaces
belonging to a particular VPLS service or a bridge domain. You can configure multiple down MEPs for a
single instance of maintenance domain identifier and maintenance association name to monitor services
provided by Virtual Private LAN service (VPLS), bridge domain, circuit cross-connect (CCC), or IPv4
domains.
For layer 2 VPNs routing instances (local switching) and EVPN routing instances, you can also configure
multiple up MEPs for a single combination of maintenance association ID and maintenance domain ID
on logical interfaces. The logical interface can be configured on different devices or on the same device.
To support multiple up MEPs on two IFLs, enhanced IP network services must be configured for the
chassis.
You can enable automatic discovery of a MEP. With automatic discovery a MEP is enabled to accept
continuity check messages (CCMs) from all remote MEPs of the same maintenance association. If
automatic discovery is not enabled, the remote MEPs must be configured. If the remote MEP is not
configured, the CCMs from the remote MEP are treated as errors.
Continuity measurement is provided by an existing continuity check protocol. The continuity for every
remote MEP is measured as the percentage of time that remote MEP was operationally up over the total
administratively enabled time. Here, the operational uptime is the total time during which the CCM
adjacency is active for a particular remote MEP and the administrative enabled time is the total time
during which the local MEP is active. You can also restart the continuity measurement by clearing the
currently measured operational uptime and the administrative enabled time.

Configure a Maintenance Association End Point (MEP)
To configure a maintenance association end point:
1. Specify an ID for the MEP at the [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-
domain domain-name maintenance-association ma-name]. You can specify any value from 1 through 8191.
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain domain-name
maintenance-association ma-name]
user@host# set mep mep-id
2. Enable maintenance end point automatic discovery so the MEP can accept continuity check
messages (CCMs) from all remote MEPs of the same maintenance association.
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain domain-name
maintenance-association ma-name mep mep-id]
user@host# set auto-discovery
3. Specify the direction in which the CCM packets are transmitted for the MEP. You can specify up or
down. If you specify the direction as up, CCMs are transmitted out of every logical interface that is
part of the same bridging or VPLS instance except for the interface configured on the MEP. If you
specify the direction as down, CCMs are transmitted only out of the interface configured on the MEP.
NOTE: Ports in the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) blocking state do not block CFM packets
destined to a down MEP. Ports in an STP blocking state without the continuity check protocol
configured do block CFM packets.
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain domain-name
maintenance-association ma-name mep mep-id]
user@host# set direction down
NOTE: Starting with Junos OS Release 12.3, for all interfaces configured on Modular Port
Concentrators (MPCs) on MX Series 5G Universal Routing Platforms, you no longer need to
configure the no-control-word statement for all Layer 2 VPNs and Layer 2 circuits over which
you are running CFM MEPs. For all other interfaces on MX Series routers and on all other
routers and switches, you must continue to configure the no-control-word statement at the [edit
routing-instances routing-instance-name protocols l2vpn] or [edit protocols l2circuit neighbor
37
neighbor-id interface interface-name] hierarchy level when you configure CFM MEPs. Otherwise,
the CFM packets are not transmitted, and the show oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management mep-
database command does not display any remote MEPs.
4. Specify the interface to which the MEP is attached. It can be a physical interface, logical interface, or
trunk interface. On MX Series routers, the MEP can be attached to a specific VLAN of a trunk
interface.
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain domain-name

5. Specify the IEEE 802.1 priority bits that are used by continuity check and link trace messages. You
can specify a value from through 7 as the priority.

6. Specify the lowest priority defect that generates a fault alarm whenever CFM detects a defect.
Possible values include: all -defects, err-xcon, mac-rem-err-xcon, no-defect, rem-err-xcon, and xcon.

Configure a Remote Maintenance Association End Point (MEP)
To configure a remote maintenance association end point:
1. Configure the remote MEP by specifying the MEP ID at the [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-
fault-management maintenance-domain domain-name maintenance-association ma-name mep mep-id]. You can specify
any value from 1 through 8191.
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain domain-name
maintenance-association ma-namemep mep-id]
user@host# edit remote-mep mep-id
2. Specify the name of the action profile to be used for the remote MEP by including the action-profile
profile-name statement at the [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain
domain-name maintenance-association ma-name mep mep-id remote-mep remote-mep-id]. The profile must be
defined at the [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management] hierarchy level.
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain domain-name
maintenance-association ma-namemep mep-id remote-mep remote-mep-id]
user@host# set action-profile profile-name
3. Configure the remote MEP to detect initial loss of connectivity. By default, the MEP does not
generate loss-of-continuity (LOC) defect messages. When you configure the detect-loc statement, a
loss-of-continuity (LOC) defect is detected if no continuity check message is received from the
remote MEP within a period equal to 3.5 times the continuity check interval configured for the
maintenance association. If a LOC defect is detected, a syslog error message is generated.
NOTE: When you configure connectivity-fault management (CFM) along with detect-loc, any
action-profile configured to bring down the interface is executed if continuity check message
is not received . However, the action-profile is not executed if you have not configured detect-
loc and continuity check message is not received.

Configure Service Protection for VPWS over MPLS Using the MEP Interface
You can enable service protection for a virtual private wire service (VPWS) over MPLS by specifying a
working path or protect path on the MEP. Service protection provides end-to-end connection protection
of the working path in the event of a failure.
To configure service protection, you must create two separate transport paths—a working path and a
protect path. You can specify the working path and protect path by creating two maintenance
associations. To associate the maintenance association with a path, you must configure the interface
statement for the MEP within the maintenance association and specify the path as working or protect.
NOTE: If the path is not specified, the session monitors the active path.
Table 5 on page 39 describes the available service protection options.
Table 5: Service Protection Options
Option Description
working Specifies the working path.
protect Specifies the protect path.
In this configuration, we enable service protection for the VPWS service. The CCM session is configured
for the working path and references the CCM session configured for the protect path using the protect-
40
maintenance-association statement. The name of the protect transport path for the maintenance
association is configured and associated with the maintenance association for the working path.
To configure service protection for VPWS over MPLS:
1. In configuration mode, create a maintenance domain by specifying the name and the name format
at the [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management ] hierarchy level.
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management]
user@host# set maintenance-domain md-name name-format option
NOTE: If you configure the maintenance domain name length greater than 45 octet, then
the following error message is displayed: error: configuration check-out failed.
2. Specify the maintenance domain level by specifying the value at the [edit protocols oam ethernet
connectivity-fault-management ] hierarchy level.
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management]
