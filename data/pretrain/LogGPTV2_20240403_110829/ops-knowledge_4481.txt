User: How to use AWS VPC to protect the network security of your application?
Assistant: AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a virtual network environment that can create a private and isolated network space on AWS, so that applications can run in a private network space, making it more secure and reliable. Here's how to secure your application's network in an AWS VPC: 1. Use Security Groups: A security group is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic. Access control can be set for different security groups, so that network traffic between different applications can be isolated from each other, improving network security. 2. Use network ACL: Network ACL is a kind of access control at the network layer, which can set rules for inbound and outbound traffic. By using network ACL, you can further control the traffic of the application program and improve network security. 3. Use a VPN connection: You can use a VPN connection to establish a secure encrypted channel to connect the application with other local networks or cloud networks. This can ensure the network security of the application program and enable the application program to transmit data more securely. 4. Use private subnets: applications can be deployed in private subnets, which can ensure that the application's network traffic only flows within the VPC, improving network security. 5. Use the subnet routing table: By setting the subnet routing table, traffic can be directed to the appropriate destination, thereby ensuring the security of network traffic. Some secure network routing protocols can be used, such as VPC traffic mirroring, DNS routing, and so on.
