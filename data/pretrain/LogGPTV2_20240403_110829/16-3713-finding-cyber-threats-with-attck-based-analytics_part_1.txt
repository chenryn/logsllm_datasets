**Abstract:**
Post-compromise intrusion detection is a critical capability for network defenders as adversaries continue to evolve methods for compromising systems and evading common defenses. This paper presents a methodology for using the MITRE ATT&CK framework, a behavior-based threat model, to identify relevant defensive sensors and build, test, and refine behavior-based analytic detection capabilities using adversary emulation. This methodology can enhance enterprise network security through defensive gap analysis, endpoint security product evaluations, building and tuning behavioral analytics for specific environments, and validating defenses against a common threat model using a red team emulating known adversary behavior.

**Introduction:**
Defending an enterprise network against advanced persistent threats (APTs) remains a significant challenge that requires advanced technologies and approaches to thwart adversary goals. In current enterprise networks, it is unlikely that organizations have the resources to detect and defend against every method an adversary might use to gain access. Even with perfect patching and software compliance, adversaries may use zero-day exploits or social engineering to gain a foothold. Once inside, adversaries often hide in the noise and complexity of the target's environment, using legitimate mechanisms and blending their activities with normal network traffic to achieve their objectives. According to FireEye’s M-Trends, the median time for an enterprise to discover a compromise was 146 days in 2015. [1]

To address these challenges, MITRE began researching data sources and analytic processes for detecting APTs more quickly under an "assume breach" mentality in 2010. The research focused on post-compromise detection, specifically on adversary behavior after gaining access to a system within a network. One driver for this approach was the observation that adversaries tend to exhibit consistent patterns of behavior while interacting with endpoint or victim systems. [2] The goal was to show that automated measurement of endpoint data or telemetry could be used to detect post-compromise operations in a way that distinguished such behavior from typical system noise. The results indicated that using analytics based on a combination of host and network behaviors provides a useful way to detect post-compromise adversary behavior.

In 2013, MITRE developed a process for modeling an adversary’s post-compromise behavior at a granular level, named ATT&CK™ (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge). [3] ATT&CK serves as both an adversary emulation playbook and a method for discovering analytic coverage and defense gaps within a target network. It was released in 2015 and is available at https://attack.mitre.org.

Additionally, MITRE researchers created a method for describing behavioral intrusion detection analytics and a suite of analytics aligned with the ATT&CK model, which have been made publicly available through the MITRE Cyber Analytics Repository. [4]

The creation of behavioral detection analytics and the efficacy of this approach were validated through a series of "cyber games" pitting a Red Team performing adversary emulation using APT behavior (as described in the ATT&CK model) against a Blue Team using analytics to detect the Red Team’s intrusion and the scope of its actions throughout the targeted network. These games were conducted on a 250-node production enclave on MITRE’s live corporate network to ensure realistic network and system noise, allowing the analytics to be tuned appropriately to detect malicious behavior.

The purpose of this paper is to:
1. Educate readers on how to apply the MITRE ATT&CK model for better detection of APTs operating within a given system or network.
2. Describe the processes and methods for developing the ATT&CK model and its associated analytics.
3. Share practical experiences and anecdotes to help organizations protect their networks and systems.

The paper begins by orienting the reader with a hypothetical APT campaign described using tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) from the ATT&CK model. MITRE’s high-level research process and the behavioral detection paradigm it developed are then described in Section 2. The ATT&CK model itself is detailed in Section 3. Section 4 explains the process of applying ATT&CK for developing behavioral intrusion detection analytics. Section 5 details some of MITRE’s experiences in applying this methodology. Section 6 provides a summary of MITRE’s work.

**1.1 Frame of Reference:**
To understand the applicability of the research, consider a hypothetical APT campaign based on an adversary’s post-compromise TTPs. The hypothetical adversary uses publicly reported TTPs, each described in the ATT&CK model and referenced in footnotes. The ATT&CK model, explained further in Section 3, describes post-compromise adversary behavior.

The hypothetical campaign begins with an adversary sending a spear-phishing email designed around a current event of interest. [5] The payload is a .zip file containing a decoy PDF and a malicious executable disguised as a PDF on systems with Acrobat Reader installed. [6] When run, the executable downloads a second-stage Remote Access Tool (RAT) payload, giving a remote operator access to the victim computer and an initial entry point into the network. The adversary generates new domain names for Command and Control (C2) purposes and sends these domains to the RAT through periodically changing Twitter handles. [7] The C2 domains and IP addresses are short-lived and changed frequently. The adversary maintains a presence on the victim computer by installing a Windows service with a name easily assumed to be legitimate. [3] Before deployment, the malware is tested against various anti-virus products to ensure it does not match any known signatures. [5]

The remote operator uses the RAT to start a Windows command prompt and employs built-in Windows tools or legitimate third-party administration tools to learn more about the victim’s system and network. [6] The adversary discovers internal host and network resources, including accounts, permissions groups, processes, services, network configuration, and nearby network resources. [7-13] The remote operator may bulk-capture cached authentication credentials using Invoke-Mimikatz, a PowerShell wrapper for Mimikatz, which runs without writing an executable to the hard drive. [14-16] Lateral movement occurs after gathering sufficient information, typically using mapped Windows admin shares and remote file copies coupled with remotely scheduled tasks. [17-19] With each increased access, the adversary finds documents of interest within the network, stages them to a central location, compresses and encrypts the files, and exfiltrates them via a well-formed HTTP session inside SSL/TLS. [20-28]

**1.2 Shortcomings of Contemporary Approaches for Detection:**
Contemporary network security approaches struggle to detect APTs similar to the hypothetical example. Most antivirus applications may not reliably detect custom tools because they are tested against various products before use and may contain obfuscation techniques to evade detection. [10] Malicious remote operators can use legitimate functionality on compromised systems, essentially "living off the land," to avoid detection since many defensive tools do not collect sufficient data to detect this kind of malicious use of otherwise appropriate system behavior.

Other current approaches, such as threat intelligence feed subscription or sharing, may not help detect the use of adversary infrastructure because indicators change too rapidly. Typical network traffic inspection is not useful either, as APT traffic is often encrypted with valid SSL. SSL interception may be helpful but requires prior knowledge of components with known signatures. Without this, distinguishing malicious activity from benign network behavior is extremely difficult. These shortcomings led MITRE to develop a different method for detecting APTs, focusing on an adversary’s post-compromise behavior using the ATT&CK threat model.

**Threat-Based Security Approach:**
MITRE’s threat-based approach to network compromise detection uses a behavioral methodology guided by five principles developed over the course of its research. These principles describe critical tenets of an effective threat-based approach to network security. They are summarized here (Figure 1) and explained in detail in the following sections.

**Principle 1: Include Post-Compromise Detection** – Over time, previously effective perimeter and preventative defenses may fail to keep persistent threats out of a network. Post-compromise detection is essential to identify and mitigate threats that have already gained access.
