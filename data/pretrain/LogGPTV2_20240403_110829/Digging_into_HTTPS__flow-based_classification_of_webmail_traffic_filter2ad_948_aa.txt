ABSTRACT
1.
INTRODUCTION
Recently, webmail interfaces, e.g., Horde, Outlook Web Access,
and webmail platforms such as GMail, Yahoo!, and Hotmail have
seen a tremendous boost in popularity. Given the importance of
e-mail for personal and business use alike, and its exposure to im-
minent threats, there exists the need for a comprehensive view of
the Internet mail system, including webmail trafﬁc.
In this paper we propose a novel, passive approach to identify
webmail trafﬁc solely based on network-level data in order to ob-
tain a comprehensive view of the mail system. Key to our approach
is that we leverage correlations across protocols and time to intro-
duce novel features for HTTPS webmail classiﬁcation: First, web-
mail servers tend to reside close to legacy IMAP and POP mail
servers, which are easy to identify. Second, the usage of webmail
services results in distinct patterns on sessions’ duration and on the
diurnal/weekly trafﬁc usage proﬁle. Third, trafﬁc ﬂows to webmail
platforms exhibit inherent periodicities since AJAX-based clients
periodically check for new messages. We use these features to
build a simple classiﬁer and detect webmail trafﬁc on real-world
NetFlow traces from a medium-sized backbone network.
We believe that the major contribution of this paper – exploring
a set of new features that could classify applications that run over
HTTPS ports solely based on NetFlow data – will stimulate more
general advance in the ﬁeld of trafﬁc classiﬁcation.

Speculations that web browsers could gradually supplant tradi-
tional operating systems as the default platform for user applica-
tions [21] go back to the ﬁrst browser war in the mid 90’s. Accord-
ing to recent reports [6] many Internet users prefer to access their
e-mail via a web-based (webmail) interface such as Horde [11],
Outlook Web Access (OWA) [25], or a webmail platform as pro-
vided by GMail, Yahoo!, or Hotmail. Similar trends also hold for
many other applications, such as video, VoIP, and instant messag-
ing, presently making browsers more than ever before the new op-
erating system.
This trend however is detrimental for the ﬁeld of Internet trafﬁc
classiﬁcation, which over the past years has seen a plethora of pro-
posals [16]. Evidently, port-based approaches are insufﬁcient since
many of today’s applications use port 80 or HTTPS port 443 [23].
Signature-based solutions [5,9,14,23,30], which generally assume
packet-level traces, fail if payload encryption is used, raise privacy
or legal issues, and may not scale well enough to obtain a network-
wide characterization of trafﬁc. Even with hard to obtain, unen-
crypted full-packet traces, it is very difﬁcult to identify the applica-
tions in use [8]. Statistics-based (e.g., [1, 2, 7, 19, 20, 22, 27]) and
host-behavior-based [13–15] techniques avoid payload inspection.
The former rely mainly on ﬂow-level features such as ﬂow duration,
number and size of packets per ﬂow and classify trafﬁc ﬂows. In
our extensive experiments, we have found that ﬂow-based features
are not sufﬁcient to classify individual HTTPS ﬂows as webmail or
not. Finally, host-based approaches (e.g., BLINC [14]) attempt to
classify a host directly based on its communication pattern, and are
the closest in spirit to our approach. Yet, to our best knowledge,
host-based approaches have not been applied before to HTTP(S)
trafﬁc classiﬁcation.
As a ﬁrst step towards deciphering HTTP(S) trafﬁc, we, in this
work, address the challenging problem of extracting HTTPS-based
webmail trafﬁc from coarse-grained NetFlow data. Given its im-
portance for personal and business use, and its exposure to immi-
nent threats [3, 12], there exists a need for a comprehensive view
of the Internet mail system [10, 26, 28], including webmail traf-
ﬁc. Measuring webmail trafﬁc can enhance our understanding of
shifting usage trends and mail trafﬁc evolution. Surprisingly, we
ﬁnd that more than 66% of all HTTPS ﬂows observed at the border
routers of the SWITCH backbone network [31] are related to web-
mail. With GMail having recently enabled HTTPS by default (and
other platforms expected to follow), this number will only increase
in the future.
The most important contribution in this work is the introduc-
tion and evaluation of three novel features for identifying HTTPS
322mail trafﬁc. Key to our approach is that we leverage correlations
across protocols and time: (i) The Internet mail system is an inter-
play of multiple protocols (SMTP, IMAP, POP, webmail). We ﬁnd
that webmail servers tend to reside in the vicinity of legacy SMTP,
IMAP, and POP servers, which can be identiﬁed easily and reli-
ably [17] using port numbers, thus providing signiﬁcant hints for
detecting webmail servers. (ii) Moreover, clients of a mail server
share certain characteristics (e.g., usage patterns) irrespective of the
used mail delivery protocol, i.e., IMAP, POP, or webmail. (iii) Fi-
nally, webmail trafﬁc exhibits pronounced periodic patterns due to
application timers (and more generally AJAX-based technologies).
This paper shows that these features can be harvested solely from
coarse-grained NetFlow data to classify webmail trafﬁc.
To get a ﬁrst impression of the ability of the above features to un-
cover webmail trafﬁc, we train a simple classiﬁer based on a (man-
ually) pre-labeled set of hosts. Although ﬁnding the best possible
classiﬁer is beyond the scope of this paper, our simple classiﬁer
already exhibits 93.2% accuracy and 79.2% precision in detecting
HTTPS servers within SWITCH, which is remarkable given that
we rely solely on NetFlow data. Moreover, our work shows that
we can also effectively detect webmail trafﬁc (e.g., GMail) towards
mail servers outside the SWITCH network, for which only a small
sample of their total trafﬁc is visible.
As a ﬁnal note, we expect our methodology to stimulate advance
in the ﬁeld of trafﬁc classiﬁcation in general. For example, for
our third feature we distinguish between “machine-generated” and
“user-invoked” trafﬁc based on network-level data, which is a very
general method that can be used for several different types of de-
tection problems.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 ex-
plains our data set we have used. Section 3 introduces and discusses
features to discriminate mail-related trafﬁc from other web trafﬁc.
Then, Section 4 describes how we construct a classiﬁer based on
the features we identify and presents our ﬁrst results. Finally, we
give an overview of related work in Section 5 and conclude in Sec-
tion 6.
2. DATA SETS AND GROUND TRUTH
Throughout this paper we will rely on NetFlow traces coming
from SWITCH [31], a medium-sized ISP. SWITCH is a backbone
operator connecting approximately 30 Swiss universities, govern-
ment institutions, and research labs. For our studies we have col-
lected a trace in March 2010 that spans 11 days and contains un-
sampled ﬂows summarizing all trafﬁc crossing the borders of SWITCH.
This results in 50 to 140 million NetFlow records per hour, with ap-
proximately 3% being HTTPS. Over the 11 days, we observe more
than 1 billion HTTPS records.
Instead of analyzing individual ﬂows, we mainly consider ses-
sions. Our ﬂow collectors break up long-lived ﬂows into smaller
fragments. Therefore, we merge ﬂows sharing the same 5-tuple
(source address and port, destination address and port, transport
protocol identiﬁer) if trafﬁc exchange does not stay silent for more
than 900s. Moreover, we group merged ﬂows with the same IP
addresses into a session if they are not more than 1, 800s apart in
time. These values have been determined empirically, and found to
work well in the past.
To train a classiﬁer and to verify the accuracy of our classiﬁca-
tion in Section 4 we need a labelled data set. To this end, we ﬁrst
extract from a 1-hour trace recorded on Monday noon 2010-03-15
the 500 most popular internal HTTPS hosts/sockets (top500) in
terms of unique IP addresses they communicate with. Then, we
manually access each of the 500 obtained IP addresses with a web
browser and determine the host type (e.g., Horde, OWA). In cases

where this does not work (e.g., Skype), we use nmap. Table 1
summarizes the results of this time-consuming task.
The fact that 66% of the observed HTTPS ﬂows are related to
Outlook Web Access, Horde, or other webmail interfaces (e.g.,
CommuniGate, SquirrelMail) is surprising and emphasizes the high
popularity of webmail. Although the numbers may vary, we believe
that our ﬁnding also holds for networks other than SWITCH. After
all, e-mail is an omnipresent service in today’s Internet. While we
cannot label 5% of the top500 hosts, we further differentiate 398
non-mail data sources into WWW content (e.g., e-shops, e-learning
platforms), Skype, VPN services, etc.
3. FEATURES
We are now ready to discuss the features we propose for discrim-
inating between mail related web trafﬁc and other HTTPS trafﬁc.
As mentioned earlier, classifying individual ﬂows relying on ﬂow-
level statistics alone (e.g., packets and bytes per ﬂow) does not
work well. For example, cross-checking the distribution of num-
ber of bytes per ﬂow does not reveal any signiﬁcant differences
between webmail and other HTTPS trafﬁc ﬂows.
An important challenge for feature extraction is to overcome the
inherent heterogeneity of webmail trafﬁc caused by the high num-
ber of different webmail implementations.
The features we present in the following are based on two main
observations: ﬁrst, the network-wide view provided by our ﬂow-
based data set allows to leverage correlations across hosts and pro-
tocols; second, periodic patterns due to regular timeouts are visible
in ﬂow data and provide useful application ﬁngerprints.
To this end, this section sketches three approaches for distin-
guishing webmail from other HTTPS trafﬁc. The key ideas are
as follows: (i) classical mail services (POP, IMAP, SMTP) are fre-
quently in the vicinity of webmail services (see Section 3.1), (ii) the
client base of legacy mail services and the clients of its associated
webmail service share common behavior in terms of user activity
(Section 3.2), and (iii) trafﬁc generated by AJAX-based webmail
clients shows a pronounced periodicity that we can leverage to ex-
tract webmail trafﬁc (Section 3.3). The following subsections ex-
plain these methods in detail, discuss their efﬁciency, and describe
how to obtain features that can be used as input for a classiﬁer.1
All three feature categories that we present in the following are
broad in the sense that the key ideas are not limited to webmail clas-
siﬁcation. We believe that our features can be more generally ap-
plied towards demultiplexing HTTP(S) trafﬁc into individual appli-

mality, have been our guiding principles in translating our observa-
