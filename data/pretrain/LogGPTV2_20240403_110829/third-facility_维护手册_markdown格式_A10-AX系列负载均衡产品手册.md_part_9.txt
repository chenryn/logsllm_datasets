Parameter Description
any | The source IP addresses to filter.
host host-src-ipaddr |
• any - the ACL matches on any source IP address.
net-src-ipaddr {
filter-mask | • host host-src-ipaddr - the ACL matches only on the specified host IP address.
/mask-length} • net-src-ipaddr {filter-mask | /mask-length} - the ACL matches on any
host in the specified subnet. The filter-mask specifies the portion of the address to fil-
ter:
• Use 0 to match.
• Use 255 to ignore.
For example, the filter-mask 0.0.0.255 filters on a 24-bit subnet.
Alternatively, you can use /mask-length to specify the portion of the address to fil-
ter. For example, you can specify “/24” instead “0.0.0.255” to filter on a 24-bit subnet.
eq src-port | The source protocol ports to filter for TCP and UDP:
gt src-port |
• eq src-port - The ACL matches on traffic from the specified source port.
lt src-port |
range • gt src-port - The ACL matches on traffic from any source port with a higher
start-src-port number than the specified port.
end-src-port • lt src-port - The ACL matches on traffic from any source port with a lower num-
ber than the specified port.
• range start-src-port end-src-port - The ACL matches on traffic from any
source port within the specified range.
any | The destination IP addresses to filter.
host host-dst-ipaddr |
• any - the ACL matches on any destination IP address.
net-dst-ipaddr {
filter-mask | • host host-dst-ipaddr - the ACL matches only on the specified host IP address.
/mask-length} • net-dst-ipaddr {filter-mask | /mask-length} - the ACL matches on any
host in the specified subnet. The filter-mask specifies the portion of the address to fil-
ter:
• Use 0 to match.
• Use 255 to ignore.
For example, the filter-mask 0.0.0.255 filters on a 24-bit subnet.
Alternatively, you can use /mask-length to specify the portion of the address to fil-
ter. For example, you can specify “/24” instead “0.0.0.255” to filter on a 24-bit subnet.
eq dst-port | The destination protocol ports to filter for TCP and UDP:
gt dst-port |
• eq src-port - The ACL matches on traffic from the specified destination port.
lt dst-port |
range • gt src-port - The ACL matches on traffic from any destination port with a higher
start-dst-port number than the specified port.
end-dst-port • lt src-port - The ACL matches on traffic from any destination port with a lower
number than the specified port.
• range start-src-port end-src-port - The ACL matches on traffic from any
destination port within the specified range.
fragments Matches on packets in which the More bit in the header is set (1) or has a non-zero off-
set.
vlan vlan-id Matches on the specified VLAN. VLAN matching occurs for incoming traffic only.
dscp num Matches on the 6-bit Diffserv value in the IP header, 1-63.

A10 Thunder Series and AX Series—Command Line Interface Reference
Parameter Description
established Matches on TCP packets in which the ACK or RST bit is set.
This option is useful for protecting against attacks from outside. Since a TCP connec-
tion from the outside does not have the ACK bit set (SYN only), the connection is
dropped. Similarly, a connection established from the inside always has the ACK bit set.
(The first packet to the network from outside is a SYN/ACK.)
log Configures the ACOS device to generate log messages when traffic matches the ACL.
[transparent-session-
The transparent-session-only option limits logging for an ACL rule to creation
only]
and deletion of transparent sessions for traffic that matches the ACL rule.
Default No ACLs are configured by default. When you configure one, the log option is disabled by
default.
Mode Configuration mode
Usage An ACL can contain multiple rules. Each access-list command configures one rule. Rules
are added to the ACL in the order you configure them. The first rule you add appears at the
top of the ACL.
Rules are applied to the traffic in the order they appear in the ACL (from the top, which is the
first, rule downward). The first rule that matches traffic is used to permit or deny that traffic.
After the first rule match, no additional rules are compared against the traffic.
To move a rule within the sequence, delete the rule, then re-add it with a new sequence
number.
Access lists do not take effect until you apply them:
• To use an ACL to filter traffic on an interface, see the interface command in the”Con-
fig Commands: Interface” chapter in the Network Configuration Guide.
• To use an ACL to filter traffic on a virtual server port, see “access-list” in the Command
Line Interface Reference for ADC.
• To use an ACL with source NAT, see the ip nat inside source command in “Con-
fig Commands: IP” chapter in the Network Configuration Guide.
accounting
Description Configure TACACS+ as the accounting method for recording information about user activi-
ties. The ACOS device supports the following types of accounting:
• EXEC accounting – provides information about EXEC terminal sessions (user shells) on
the ACOS device.
• Command accounting – provides information about the EXEC shell commands exe-
cuted under a specified privilege level. This command also allows you to specify the
debug level.
Syntax [no] accounting exec {start-stop | stop-only} {radius | tacplus}
[no] accounting commands cmd-level stop-only tacplus
Document No.: 410-P2-CLI-001 - 6/17/2016 | page 74
A10 Thunder Series and AX Series—Command Line Interface Reference
[no] accounting debug debug-level
Parameter Description
start-stop Sends an Accounting START packet to TACACS+ servers when a user establishes a CLI session,
and an Accounting STOP packet when the user logs out or the session times out.
stop-only Only sends an Accounting STOP packet when the user logs out or the session times out.
radius | tacplus Specifies the type of accounting server to use.
cmd-level Specifies which level of commands will be accounted:
• 15 (admin) - commands available to the admin (all commands).
• 14 (config) - commands available in config mode (not including the commands of the admin
and those under the admin mode).
• 1 (priv EXEC) - commands available in privileged EXEC mode.
• 0 (user EXEC) - commands available in user EXEC mode.
Command levels 2-13 as the same as command level 1.
debug-level Specifies the debug level for accounting. The debug level is set as flag bits for different types of
debug messages. The ACOS device has the following types of debug messages:
• 0x1 - Common information such as “trying to connect with TACACS+ servers”, “getting
response from TACACS+ servers”; they are recorded in syslog.
• 0x2 - Packet fields sent out and received by ACOS, not including the length fields; they are
printed out on the terminal.
• 0x4 - Length fields of the TACACS+ packets will also be printed on the terminal.
• 0x8 - Information about the TACACS+ MD5 encryption is recorded in syslog.
Default N/A
Mode Configuration mode
Usage The accounting server also must be configured. See “radius-server” on page175 or “tacacs-
server host” on page205.
Example The following command configures the ACOS device to send an Accounting START packet
to the previously defined TACACS+ servers when a user establishes a CLI session on the
device. The ACOS device also will send an Accounting STOP packet when a user logs out or
their session times out.
ACOS(config)#accounting exec start-stop tacplus
Example The following command configures the ACOS device to send an Accounting STOP packet
when a user logs out or a session times out.
ACOS(config)#accounting exec stop-only tacplus
Example The following command configures the ACOS device to send an Accounting STOP packet to
TACACS+ servers before a CLI command of level 14 is executed.
