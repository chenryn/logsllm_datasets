    - **`filter-mask`**:
      - Use `0` to match.
      - Use `255` to ignore.
    - **Example**: `0.0.0.255` filters on a 24-bit subnet.
    - **`/mask-length`**: Alternatively, use `/mask-length` to specify the portion of the address to filter. For example, `/24` instead of `0.0.0.255` to filter on a 24-bit subnet.

**Source Protocol Ports (TCP and UDP)**
- **`eq src-port | gt src-port | lt src-port | range start-src-port end-src-port`**:
  - **`eq src-port`**: The ACL matches on traffic from the specified source port.
  - **`gt src-port`**: The ACL matches on traffic from any source port with a higher number than the specified port.
  - **`lt src-port`**: The ACL matches on traffic from any source port with a lower number than the specified port.
  - **`range start-src-port end-src-port`**: The ACL matches on traffic from any source port within the specified range.

**Destination IP Addresses**

  - **`eq dst-port`**: The ACL matches on traffic from the specified destination port.
  - **`gt dst-port`**: The ACL matches on traffic from any destination port with a higher number than the specified port.
  - **`lt dst-port`**: The ACL matches on traffic from any destination port with a lower number than the specified port.
  - **`range start-dst-port end-dst-port`**: The ACL matches on traffic from any destination port within the specified range.

**Fragments**
- **`fragments`**: Matches on packets where the More bit in the header is set (1) or has a non-zero offset.

**VLAN**
- **`vlan vlan-id`**: Matches on the specified VLAN. VLAN matching occurs for incoming traffic only.

**DSCP**
- **`dscp num`**: Matches on the 6-bit Diffserv value in the IP header, 1-63.

**Established**
- **`established`**: Matches on TCP packets where the ACK or RST bit is set. This option is useful for protecting against attacks from outside, as a TCP connection from the outside does not have the ACK bit set (SYN only), and the connection is dropped. A connection established from the inside always has the ACK bit set.

**Log**
- **`log`**: Configures the ACOS device to generate log messages when traffic matches the ACL.
- **`[transparent-session-only]`**: Limits logging for an ACL rule to creation and deletion of transparent sessions for traffic that matches the ACL rule.
- **Default:** No ACLs are configured by default. When you configure one, the log option is disabled by default.

**Mode**
- **Configuration mode**

**Usage**
- An ACL can contain multiple rules. Each `access-list` command configures one rule. Rules are added to the ACL in the order they are configured. The first rule you add appears at the top of the ACL.
- Rules are applied to the traffic in the order they appear in the ACL (from the top, which is the first, rule downward). The first rule that matches traffic is used to permit or deny that traffic. After the first rule match, no additional rules are compared against the traffic.
- To move a rule within the sequence, delete the rule, then re-add it with a new sequence number.
- Access lists do not take effect until you apply them:
  - **To use an ACL to filter traffic on an interface**, see the `interface` command in the "Config Commands: Interface" chapter in the Network Configuration Guide.
  - **To use an ACL to filter traffic on a virtual server port**, see "access-list" in the Command Line Interface Reference for ADC.
  - **To use an ACL with source NAT**, see the `ip nat inside source` command in the "Config Commands: IP" chapter in the Network Configuration Guide.

### Accounting

**Description**
- Configure TACACS+ as the accounting method for recording information about user activities. The ACOS device supports the following types of accounting:
  - **EXEC accounting**: Provides information about EXEC terminal sessions (user shells) on the ACOS device.
  - **Command accounting**: Provides information about the EXEC shell commands executed under a specified privilege level. This command also allows you to specify the debug level.

**Syntax**
- `[no] accounting exec {start-stop | stop-only} {radius | tacplus}`
- `[no] accounting commands cmd-level stop-only tacplus`
- `[no] accounting debug debug-level`

**Parameters**
- **`start-stop`**: Sends an Accounting START packet to TACACS+ servers when a user establishes a CLI session, and an Accounting STOP packet when the user logs out or the session times out.
- **`stop-only`**: Only sends an Accounting STOP packet when the user logs out or the session times out.
- **`radius | tacplus`**: Specifies the type of accounting server to use.
- **`cmd-level`**: Specifies which level of commands will be accounted:
  - **`15 (admin)`**: Commands available to the admin (all commands).
  - **`14 (config)`**: Commands available in config mode (not including the commands of the admin and those under the admin mode).
  - **`1 (priv EXEC)`**: Commands available in privileged EXEC mode.
  - **`0 (user EXEC)`**: Commands available in user EXEC mode.
  - **Command levels 2-13** are the same as command level 1.
- **`debug-level`**: Specifies the debug level for accounting. The debug level is set as flag bits for different types of debug messages. The ACOS device has the following types of debug messages:
  - **`0x1`**: Common information such as "trying to connect with TACACS+ servers", "getting response from TACACS+ servers"; they are recorded in syslog.
  - **`0x2`**: Packet fields sent out and received by ACOS, not including the length fields; they are printed out on the terminal.
  - **`0x4`**: Length fields of the TACACS+ packets will also be printed on the terminal.
  - **`0x8`**: Information about the TACACS+ MD5 encryption is recorded in syslog.

**Default**
- N/A

**Mode**
- Configuration mode

**Usage**
- The accounting server must also be configured. See "radius-server" on page 175 or "tacacs-server host" on page 205.

**Examples**
- **Example 1**: Configures the ACOS device to send an Accounting START packet to the previously defined TACACS+ servers when a user establishes a CLI session on the device. The ACOS device will also send an Accounting STOP packet when a user logs out or their session times out.
  ```shell
  ACOS(config)#accounting exec start-stop tacplus
  ```
- **Example 2**: Configures the ACOS device to send an Accounting STOP packet when a user logs out or a session times out.
  ```shell
  ACOS(config)#accounting exec stop-only tacplus
  ```
- **Example 3**: Configures the ACOS device to send an Accounting STOP packet to TACACS+ servers before a CLI command of level 14 is executed.
  ```shell
  ACOS(config)#accounting commands 14 stop-only tacplus
  ```
- **Example 4**: Specifies debug level 15 for accounting.
  ```shell
  ACOS(config)#accounting debug l5
  ```

### Admin

**Description**
- Configure an admin account for management access to the ACOS device.

**Syntax**
- `[no] admin admin-username [password string]`

**Parameters**
- **`admin-username`**: Replace with the user name of an admin (1-31 characters).

**Commands**
- **`access {cli | web | axapi}`**: Specifies the management interfaces through which the admin is allowed to access the ACOS device. By default, access is allowed through the CLI, GUI, and aXAPI.
- **`disable`**: Disables the admin account. By default, admin accounts are enabled when they are added.
- **`enable`**: Enables the admin account. By default, admin accounts are enabled when they are added.
- **`password string`**: Sets the password, 1-63 characters. Passwords are case sensitive and can contain special characters. (For more information, see "Special Character Support in Strings" on page 15.) The default password is "a10"; this is the default for the "admin" account and for any admin account you configure if you do not configure the password for the account.
- **`privilege`**:
  - **`read`**: The admin can access the User EXEC and Privileged EXEC levels of the CLI only.
  - **`write`**: The admin can access all levels of the CLI.
  - **`partition-read`**: The admin has read-only privileges within the L3V partition to which the admin is assigned, and read-only privileges for the shared partition.
  - **`partition-write`**: The admin has read-write privileges within the L3V partition to which the admin is assigned. The admin has read-only privileges for the shared partition.
  - **`partition-enable-disable`**: The admin has read-only privileges for real servers, with permission to view service port statistics and to disable or re-enable the servers and their service ports. No other read-only or read-write privileges are granted.
  - **`partition-name`**: The name of the L3V partition to which the admin is assigned. This option applies only to admins that have privilege level `partition-read`, `partition-write`, or `partition-enable-disable`.
- **`ssh-pubkey`**:
  - **`import url`**: Imports the public key onto the ACOS device. The `url` specifies the file transfer protocol, username (if required), and directory path. You can enter the entire URL on the command line or press Enter to display a prompt for each part of the URL. If you enter the entire URL and a password is required, you will still be prompted for the password. The password can be up to 255 characters long.
    - **Examples**:
      - `tftp://host/file`
      - `ftp://[user@]host[port:]/file`
      - `scp://[user@]host/file`
      - `sftp://[user@]host/file`
  - **`delete num`**: Deletes a public key. The `num` option specifies the key number on the ACOS device. The key numbers are displayed along with the keys themselves by the `ssh-pubkey list` command.
  - **`list`**: Verifies installation of the public key.
- **`trusted-host {ipaddr {subnet-mask | /mask-length} | access-list acl-id}`**: Specifies the host or subnet address from which the admin is allowed to log onto the ACOS device. The trusted host can be either a single host (specified with the IP address and subnet mask), or a configured access control list (ACL) on your system. The default trusted host is `0.0.0.0/0`, which allows access from any host or subnet.
- **`unlock`**: Unlocks the account. Use this option if the admin has been locked out due to too many login attempts with an incorrect password. (To configure lockout parameters, see "admin-lockout" on page 79.)

**Default**
- The system has a default admin account, with username "admin" and password "a10". The default admin account has write privilege and can log on from any host or subnet address. Other defaults are described in the descriptions above.

**Mode**
- Configuration mode

**Usage**
- An additional session is reserved for the "admin" account to ensure access. If the maximum number of concurrent open sessions is reached, the "admin" admin can still log in using the reserved session. This reserved session is available only to the "admin" account.

**Examples**
- **Example 1**: Adds admin "adminuser1" with password "1234".
  ```shell
  ACOS(config)#admin adminuser1
  ACOS(config-admin:adminuser1)#password 1234
  ```
- **Example 2**: Adds admin "adminuser3" with password "abcdefgh" and write privilege, and restricts login access to the 10.10.10.x subnet only.
  ```shell
  ACOS(config)#admin adminuser3
  ACOS(config-admin:adminuser3)#password abcdefgh
  ACOS(config-admin:adminuser3)#privilege write
  ACOS(config-admin:adminuser3)#trusted-host 10.10.10.0 /24
  ```
- **Example 3**: Configures an admin account for a private partition.
  ```shell
  ACOS(config)#admin compAadmin password compApwd
  ACOS(config-admin:compAadmin)#privilege partition-write companyA
  Modify Admin User successful !
  ```
- **Example 4**: Denies management access by admin "admin2" using the CLI or aXAPI.
  ```shell
  ACOS(config)#admin admin2
  ACOS(config-admin:admin2)#no access cli
  ACOS(config-admin:admin2)#no access axapi
  ```
- **Example 5**: Adds admin "admin4" with password "examplepassword" and default privileges, and restricts login access as defined by access list 2. The show output confirms that "ACL 2" is the trusted host.
  ```shell
  ACOS(config)#admin admin4 password examplepassword
  ACOS(config-admin)#trusted-host access-list 2
  Modify Admin User successful!
  ACOS(config-admin)#show admin admin4 detail
