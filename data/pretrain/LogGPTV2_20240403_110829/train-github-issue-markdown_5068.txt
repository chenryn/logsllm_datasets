We have a custom user provider created based on this documentation and a
custom authenticator based on this documentation. Furthermore we trigger the
firewall ourselves during our routing, because we have dynamic firewalls
depending on dynamic page paths and settings.
Now with cookie based session authentication, the ContextListener calls
`refreshUser()` on the provider.
The token is still not authenticated here. Only a first **authorization**
request such as configured access directives on the route or a call to
`isGranted()` will cause the token to be **authenticated** , which is fine, we
can still manually authenticate the token if need be.
However, upon authentication the authenticator will call
`loadUserByUsername()`, loading the user again, despite the `refreshUser()`
before.
What is the intended workflow here? Is the documentation faulty? Should the
authenticator not load the user again? Or should the ContextListener not
refresh the user? Because right now the only thing the refresh does is finding
out if the user was deleted, but all the other checks, like the user's
isActive-flag, are only checked during authentication. Maybe the
ContextListener should immediately authenticate the user?
