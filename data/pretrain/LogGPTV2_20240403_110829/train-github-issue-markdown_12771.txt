I was surprised (pleasantly so) to read that events bubble through portals and
up the component tree rather than the DOM tree. Obviously this means I can
detect clicks that occur within my component or child components without
having to worry about whether they happen to be portal hosted.
However, another fairly common thing you may want to do is detect whether an
event occurred _outside_ of a component or child components. There are plenty
of libraries out there that do this, but they all (AFAIK) use the DOM tree so
don't have this same behaviour.
I was curious whether or not there is anything new, but unadvertised, in React
16 that can help with this part of the puzzle?
