Hello,  
I have this problem, if I rendered page _XX_ through the server (Express),
which uses the alias (as) _YY_ , click on `` doesn't work.
### Current Behavior
We display the XX page, there is a link to the same page, but with extra param
- defined in this way `` then clicking on it
do nothing, no errors in the console.  
I noticed that the link works if I change `href="/XX?id=1"` to
`href="_random_string_"`.
Also when I change the subpage to _ZZ_ dynamically and return dynamically to
_XX_ , Link works correctly ( **expected** ).
### Expected Behavior
Clicking on `` changes the parameter in the url without changing the
page.
### Context
Let's say I have a list of recipes in strore and I display them on the page
_/recipes_ , when I click on the Link, I do not want to change the page, just
add the parameter /recipies/1 and load the selected recipe details.
