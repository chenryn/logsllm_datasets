## Abstract

In 2016, law enforcement dismantled the infrastructure of the Avalanche bulletproof hosting service, marking the largest takedown of a cybercrime operation to date. The malware families supported by Avalanche use Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) to generate random domain names for controlling their botnets. The takedown proactively targets these presumably malicious domains; however, as coincidental collisions with legitimate domains are possible, investigators must first classify domains to prevent undesirable harm to website owners and botnet victims.

The constraints of this real-world takedown (proactive decisions without access to malware activity, no bulk patterns, and no active connections) mean that existing state-of-the-art approaches cannot be applied. The problem of classifying thousands of registered DGA domain names therefore required extensive, painstaking manual effort by law enforcement investigators. To significantly reduce this effort without compromising accuracy, we developed a model that automates the classification. Through a synergetic approach, we achieved an accuracy of 97.6% with ground truth from the 2017 and 2018 Avalanche takedowns. For the 2019 takedown, this translated into a 76.9% reduction in manual investigation effort. Furthermore, we interpret the model to provide investigators with insights into how benign and malicious domains differ in behavior, which features and data sources are most important, and how the model can be applied according to the practical requirements of a real-world takedown.

## I. Introduction

On November 30, 2016, a global consortium of law enforcement agencies and Internet stakeholders completed a four-year investigation aimed at dismantling the Avalanche infrastructure [31], which has been called “the world’s largest and most sophisticated cybercriminal syndicate law enforcement has encountered” [94]. For seven years, this ‘bulletproof hosting service’ [13] offered services to cybercriminal operations through a ‘crime-as-a-service’ model [94], fully managing all technical aspects of carrying out malware attacks, phishing, and spam campaigns. It supported a botnet of a massive scale: Avalanche was responsible for two-thirds of all phishing attacks in the second half of 2009 [8], and ultimately affected victims in over 180 countries with estimations of its monetary impact reaching hundreds of millions of euros worldwide [6]. The takedown operation in 2016 was supported by authorities from 30 countries and culminated in five arrests, 260 servers being taken offline, and the suspension of over 800,000 domains [31].

As part of this dismantling, a large domain takedown effort sought to disable the botnet’s communication infrastructure. This effort targets the large sets of domains that the malware families of Avalanche generate through domain generation algorithms (DGAs). Through this ‘domain fluxing’ [71], infected hosts attempt to contact all generated domains, whereas the botnet master only needs to register one to continue operating the malware, decreasing the likelihood of blacklisting and takedown. However, as security researchers have reverse-engineered several of these DGAs [71], law enforcement is able to identify upfront which domains the malware will try, after which these can be blocked or seized. Over four yearly iterations of the Avalanche takedown, more than 4.3 million domains were thus prevented from being abused, making it the largest domain takedown so far [7].

Previous work related to DGAs focused on detecting malicious domains in regular traffic, relying on strong indicators of ongoing malware activity, to discover new malware families or find infected hosts inside a network [16], [82], [100]. In this paper, we address the orthogonal issue that the Avalanche takedown faces: given – presumably malicious – DGA domains that will be generated in the future and should proactively be taken down, we seek to detect those that accidentally collide with benign domains. In particular, we assess how we can effectively support law enforcement investigators with an automated domain classification to inform the appropriate takedown action in a real-world use case. This reduces the extensive manual effort previously invested in this classification, while still maintaining the high accuracy required in such a sensitive operation. Taking down benign domains may cause prejudiced service interruption and harm their owners. At the same time, we have to guarantee that no malicious domain is left untouched, as this would allow malicious actors to target infected users once again.

We are the first to develop an approach that can be used to effectively identify the domains registered with malicious intent, within the constraints of a real-world takedown operation. First, bulk patterns no longer apply, both for domains that are benign (due to the accidental uncoordinated collisions) and malicious (due to the low number of required domains). Second, as the takedown is proactive, we cannot search for malicious activity (any ongoing activity would mean that infected machines are implicated in actual attacks and defeat the proactive purpose of the takedown). Third, we cannot actively contact domains so that the takedown can occur stealthily (otherwise attackers could evade detection and undermine the takedown). Instead, we rely on capturing more generic differences in how benign and DGA-generated malicious domains are registered and operated.

We design a machine learning-based model for classifying benign and malicious domains, and we evaluate it on ground truth from the 2017 and 2018 iterations. Using a human-in-the-loop approach that combines automated classification and manual investigation targeted at the most difficult domains, we achieve an accuracy of 97.6% for the real-world Avalanche use case, ensuring high correctness while still vastly reducing manual effort: in the 2019 iteration, our approach reduced this effort by 76.9%. However, we go beyond reporting this metric with an extensive analysis of the benefits and limitations brought by the machine learning approach as well as the real-world setting. We provide an interpretation for the factors that impact the decisions of the model, giving insight into how the owners of benign and malicious domains behave differently and how the model uses this information to make decisions. These insights can help law enforcement in their choices regarding the acceptable performance and reliability of the model.

Malware creators increasingly employ techniques that make the takedown of their command and control infrastructure more complex, and the scale of malicious operations continually increases. Further automation of the takedown process with our classifier of malicious and benign domains can support law enforcement in coping with the increased complexity. However, we need to carefully design, evaluate, and analyze such an approach to cope with the constraints of a real-world application as to avoid any adverse effect on the legitimacy of the operation. This enables law enforcement to continue disrupting malware infrastructure and protecting potential victims.

In summary, our contributions are the following:
- We assess to what extent an automated approach can assist law enforcement investigators in correctly detecting the collisions with benign domains among registered domains implicated in the Avalanche takedown, without the ability to rely on bulk malicious registrations, ongoing malware activity, or actively collected traffic.
- We develop a technique where we complement a machine learning model with targeted manual labeling of the most informative and difficult domains, to maintain performance across multiple takedown iterations while still vastly reducing the required manual investigative effort.
- We evaluate how well this approach performs and transfers for the 2017 and 2018 takedowns: we obtain an accuracy of 97.6%. The predictions of our model were used in the 2019 takedown, and we find a subsequent reduction in manual investigative effort of 76.9%.
- We critically examine the factors that impact the performance and decision-making process of our model. We find that time-based features are the most important ones, which at the same time are the most costly to evade. In terms of dataset availability, WHOIS data greatly improves accuracy, which shows its importance for conducting effective cybercrime investigations.

## II. Background

### A. Domain Generation Algorithms

Machines in a botnet such as Avalanche communicate with the malicious actor through command and control (C&C) servers. Early malware hard-coded the domain names or IP addresses of their C&C servers, making it easy to obtain this information and either blacklist the servers or even take over the corresponding infrastructure (by pointing, for instance, the domains to 'safe' IP addresses and/or having hosting providers take C&C servers down), effectively stopping the malware from further malicious operation [18]. Malware has therefore evolved from hard-coding the C&C server information to dynamically creating or updating it.

One technique of this dynamic approach is ‘domain fluxing’, in which domain generation algorithms (DGAs) create up to thousands of algorithmically generated domains (AGDs) every day [71]. The malware will then attempt to contact these domains and ignore the unavailable ones: the botnet owner therefore only needs to set up one of the generated domains to host a C&C server [18]. Avalanche combined this technique with ‘fast fluxing’, in which compromised machines hosting a proxy to the C&C server as well as the corresponding DNS entries of the AGDs rapidly switch [41], thus further evading blacklisting and takedown [31].

DGAs take as seeds parameters known to both the malware owner and the infected host, so that they both generate the same set of domains [18], [71]. These parameters, such as the length of domains, top-level domains (TLDs) to use, or seeds for pseudo-random number generators, can be hard-coded. More complex algorithms may depend on time: one of the inputs to the DGA is then the current time, either from the system clock or retrieved from a common source (e.g., GET requests to legitimate sites [99]). In this way, the DGA creates domains having a certain validity period: the timeframe during which the seed timestamps make the DGA generate that domain, which the infected machines then attempt to reach. For Avalanche malware families, these validity periods range from 1 day (e.g., Nymaim) to indefinitely (e.g., Tiny Banker).

We can further distinguish between deterministic DGAs that know all parameters upfront and non-deterministic DGAs that know some parameters only at the time of generating the domains: e.g., the DGA of the Bedep family uses exchange rates as seeds [79]. Avalanche did not use any non-deterministic DGAs, so for successfully reverse-engineered DGAs [3], [71], we can generate all potential AGDs ahead of their validity, by varying the timestamp that serves as input to the DGA.

Table I lists example names generated by DGAs, from malware hosted by Avalanche. While Example 1 appears random (a long name with many digits and no discernible words), certain DGAs generate names that look much more like legitimate domains. Example 2 shows a name generated based on a word list yielding domains that may correspond to a regular domain name. Example 3 shows a short yet randomly generated name for which there is a high probability of generating either a valid word or a plausible abbreviation. These last two examples have a high probability of generating domains that collide with existing benign domains.

Finally, certain malware families alter domain resolution on the infected host, generating traffic to hard-coded and otherwise benign domains that actually resolve to malicious IP addresses to circumvent domain-based filters [40]. While these domains are not algorithmically generated, they are present in malware code and traffic and must therefore also be classified as part of the takedown operation, to distinguish them from other hard-coded and actually malicious domains. Example 4 is one such instance using the domain of the Sixt car rental site. We include these domains in our classification, but for brevity, we refer to all domains to be classified as the ‘registered DGA domains’.

### B. Taking Down the Avalanche Infrastructure

The perpetrators behind the Avalanche infrastructure offered two services for rent by cybercriminals: registering domain names and hosting a layered network of proxy servers through which malware actors could control infected hosts and exfiltrate stolen data [3]. Avalanche thereby supported the operation of 21 malware families [5], controlling a botnet of an estimated one million machines at the time of takedown [3]. Prosecutors completed the first iteration of the takedown in November 2016, where the whole infrastructure was dismantled through arrests, server seizures, and domain name takedowns [31]. For the latter, the first iteration targeted live C&C domains, but also those that would be generated by the DGAs in the coming year, preemptively blocking these to prevent Avalanche from respawning. This effort has been repeated every year since, as in January 2020, infected machines on over two million IPs still contacted the Avalanche network [1], highlighting the potential damage if Avalanche were to respawn.

Coupled with the large number of malware families and the extensive amount of domains that these DGAs generate, this results in a large number of DGA domains to be processed. For the three yearly iterations from 2016 to 2018, this amounts to around 850,000 domains per year [5], [7], while the 2019 iteration looks ahead five years and therefore treats almost 2 million domains: this means more than 4.3 million targeted domains have been processed in total. For the DGA domains in the Avalanche takedown, law enforcement took one of three actions on the takedown date [4]:
- **Block registration**: For a not-yet-registered domain, the TLD registry blocks registration. This is the case for the vast majority of domains.
- **Seize domain**: For a domain registered by a seemingly malicious actor, it is seized from the original owner and ‘sinkholed’, i.e., it is redirected to servers of the Shadowserver Foundation. Optionally, domains are also transferred to the “Registrar of Last Resort”. Through sinkholing, law enforcement can then track how many and which infected hosts attempt to contact the domains [1] and aid in mitigation through notifications to network operators and infected users [22]. Domain seizures require a legal procedure such as obtaining a court order.
- **Classify and monitor**: For domains that are already registered and potentially benign, they are classified and monitored to ensure they do not become malicious.

## III. Problem Statement

### A. Making Accurate Takedown Decisions

The primary challenge in the Avalanche takedown is to accurately classify and take down the DGA-generated domains while minimizing the risk of mistakenly targeting benign domains. Given the proactive nature of the takedown, we cannot rely on traditional methods that detect malicious activity in real-time. Additionally, the lack of bulk patterns and the inability to actively contact domains further complicate the task. Therefore, we need to develop a robust and accurate model that can automate the classification process, reducing the manual effort required while maintaining high accuracy.

### B. Constraints and Requirements

- **Proactive Decisions**: The takedown must be proactive, meaning we cannot wait for malicious activity to occur.
- **No Bulk Patterns**: Both benign and malicious domains may lack bulk patterns, making it difficult to distinguish between them.
- **Stealthy Takedown**: We cannot actively contact domains to avoid alerting malicious actors.
- **High Accuracy**: The model must maintain high accuracy to avoid harming legitimate domain owners and to ensure that no malicious domain is left untouched.

## IV. Methodology

### A. Data Collection and Preprocessing

We collect data from various sources, including WHOIS records, passive DNS data, and historical takedown data. The data is preprocessed to extract relevant features, such as domain length, TLD, registration date, and other metadata. We also use reverse-engineered DGAs to generate potential DGA domains for the upcoming validity periods.

### B. Feature Engineering

We engineer features that capture the characteristics of both benign and malicious domains. These features include:
- **Time-based Features**: Registration date, expiration date, and other temporal information.
- **Lexical Features**: Domain length, character distribution, and presence of specific keywords.
- **WHOIS Features**: Registrar, registrant, and administrative contact information.
- **Network Features**: Passive DNS data, such as the number of IP addresses associated with the domain.

### C. Model Development

We develop a machine learning model using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. The model is trained on ground truth data from the 2017 and 2018 takedowns, and we use a human-in-the-loop approach to refine the model by manually labeling the most difficult and informative domains. The model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### D. Model Interpretation

We interpret the model to understand the factors that influence its decisions. This includes analyzing the importance of different features and providing insights into the behavior of benign and malicious domain owners. These insights can help law enforcement make informed decisions about the acceptable performance and reliability of the model.

## V. Evaluation

### A. Performance Metrics

We evaluate the model's performance using the 2017 and 2018 takedown data, achieving an accuracy of 97.6%. The model's predictions were used in the 2019 takedown, resulting in a 76.9% reduction in manual investigation effort.

### B. Transferability

We assess the model's transferability to new data, specifically the 2019 takedown. The model maintains high accuracy and significantly reduces the manual effort required, demonstrating its effectiveness in a real-world setting.

### C. Limitations and Future Work

While the model achieves high accuracy, there are limitations to consider. Time-based features, while important, can be costly to evade. Additionally, the availability of WHOIS data is crucial for improving accuracy. Future work will focus on enhancing the model's robustness and exploring additional data sources to further improve its performance.

## VI. Conclusion

In this paper, we presented a practical approach for taking down Avalanche botnets under real-world constraints. By developing a machine learning model that automates the classification of DGA-generated domains, we significantly reduced the manual effort required for the takedown while maintaining high accuracy. Our approach not only supports law enforcement in their efforts to disrupt malware infrastructure but also provides valuable insights into the behavior of benign and malicious domain owners. As the scale and complexity of cybercrime continue to increase, further automation and careful evaluation of such approaches will be essential to protect potential victims and maintain the legitimacy of takedown operations.
