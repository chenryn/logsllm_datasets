Cyber Security: A Short History
Nonetheless, two important IW thinkers remained dubious. Georgetown University 
Professor Dorothy Denning agreed that “hacktivism”65 had begun to influence politi-
cal discourse, but argued that there had not been a single verifiable case of cyber 
terrorism, and believed that no cyber attack had yet caused a human casualty.66
Furthermore, James Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies 
(CSIS) opined that cyber attacks were easy to hype because cyber security is an 
arcane discipline that is difficult for non-experts to understand. He argued that vul-
nerabilities in computers did not equate to vulnerabilities in critical infrastructures, 
and that terrorists would continue to prefer traditional physical attacks because the 
likelihood of real-world damage was much higher. While cyber attacks were a grow-
ing business problem, they did not yet pose a threat to national security.67
One decade later, it is possible that some militaries have crossed that threshold. 
A 2009 report on the cyber warfare capabilities of the People’s Republic of China 
(PRC) described a highly-networked force that can now communicate with ease 
across military services and through chains of command. Furthermore, each mili-
tary unit has a clear, offensive cyber mission in times of both war and peace. In 
peacetime, strategic intelligence is gathered via cyber espionage to help win future 
wars.68 In war, a broad array of computer network operations (CNO), electronic war-
fare (EW), and kinetic strikes will be used to achieve information superiority over an 
adversary,69 especially during the early or preemptive-strike phases of a conflict.70
Is cyber espionage alone capable of changing the balance of power among nations?
By 1999, the U.S. Energy Department had discovered hundreds of attacks on its 
computer systems from outside the United States and determined that Chinese 
hacking in particular posed an “acute” intelligence threat to U.S. nuclear weapons 
laboratories.71
The U.S. Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) is the most expensive weapons program in world 
history. Unknown hackers have stolen terabytes of JSF design and electronics data72

Hacktivism is a combination of hacking and political activism.

As evidence of state-sponsorship, the report cites sophisticated hacking techniques and the collection 
of military and China-specific policy information that is of little commercial value.

One goal would be to create exploitable “blind spots” in an adversary’s decision cycle that could, for 
example, lead to the delay of adversary military deployments.

BIRTH OF A CONCEPT: STRATEGIC CYBER SECURITY
in a mammoth case of cyber espionage that has revealed a government’s vulner-
ability to the security posture of its civilian contractors and the exasperating task 
of conducting a cyber battle damage assessment.73 Based on the IP addresses used 
and other known digital fingerprints, the JSF attacks were believed with a high level 
of certainty to come from the Chinese military.74
From a strategic perspective, the cyber threat that hits closest to home and may 
eventually spur international agreements to mitigate the hacker threat relates to 
critical infrastructure protection (CIP). The potential target list seems endless: air 
traffic,75 financial sector,76 national elections,77 water,78 even electricity.79 Trends sug-
gest that all of the above are increasingly connected to the Internet, and that custom 
IT systems are over time replaced with less expensive Windows and UNIX systems 
that are not only easier to use, but easier to hack.80
Have real-world attacks on national critical infrastructures already taken place?
In May 2009, President Obama made a dramatic announcement: “Cyber attacks 
have plunged entire cities into darkness.”81 Investigative journalists subsequently 
concluded that the attacks took place in Brazil in 2005 and 2007, affected millions 
of civilians, and that the source of the attacks is still unknown.82
National Security Planning
Scientists began to warn the world about the danger of computer hacking shortly 
after WW II. Technical precautions, at least within the national security community, 
were implemented by the 1960s.
73 
The hackers encrypted the JSF data they found before removing it from the network, so it was nearly 
impossible for investigators to determine exactly what had been stolen. JSF electronics run over 
seven million lines of computer code, more than triple currently used in the top Air Force fighter, so 
the attackers have potentially found many vulnerabilities to exploit in the future.

Cyber Security: A Short History
As the size and importance of the Internet grew, however, there was a need for 
computer security to move from a tactical to a strategic level. And the driving force 
for national policy was the realization that a combination of persistent computer 
vulnerabilities and worldwide connectivity had placed national critical infrastruc-
tures at risk.
In 1997, Bill Clinton established the President’s Commission on Critical Infrastruc-
ture Protection (PCCIP). Its final report, Critical Foundations: Protecting America’s 
Infrastructures, identified eight sectors of the U.S. economy that held strategic se-
curity value: telecommunications, electric power, gas and oil, water, transportation, 
banking and finance, emergency services, and government continuity.
PCCIP recognized not only the nation’s dependence on its critical infrastructure (CI), 
but also the dependence of modern CI on IT systems. Further, it cited “pervasive” 
vulnerabilities that were open to attack by a “wide spectrum” of potential threats 
and adversaries.
Because the cyber attack threat to CI is strategic in scope, the national response 
must be equal to the task: public awareness, investment in education, scientific re-
search, the development of cyber law, and international cooperation. New agencies 
and economic “sector coordinators” were also created,83 but PCCIP emphasized that 
no single individual or organization could be responsible for CIP because critical 
infrastructures are collective assets that the government and private sector must 
manage together.84
On December 4, 1998, Russia sponsored United Nations (UN) General Assembly 
Resolution 53/70, “Developments in the field of information and telecommunica-
tions in the context of international security.” It stated that science and technology 
play an important role in international security, and that while modern information 
and communication technology (ICT) offers civilization the “broadest positive op-
portunities,” ICT was nonetheless vulnerable to misuse by criminals and terrorists. 
UN member states were therefore requested to inform the Secretary-General of their 
concerns regarding ICT misuse and offer proposals to enhance its security in the 
future. The UN adopted Resolution 53/70 on January 4, 1999.85
The most successful international cyber security agreement to date – the Council of 
Europe Convention on Cybercrime – opened for signature in 2001. This treaty takes 
83 
PCCIP led to many developments relative to cyber security, including Presidential Decision Directive 
63 (PDD-63), National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC), Critical Infrastructure Assurance 
Office (CIAO), National Infrastructure Assurance Council (NIAC), Information Sharing and Assessment 
Centers (ISACs), and DoD Joint Task Force—Computer Network Defense (JTF-CND).

aim at copyright infringement, fraud, child pornography and violations of network 
security policy. It offers guidelines to law enforcement regarding data interception 
and the search of computer networks. Its ultimate goal is a common policy on cyber 
crime worldwide via national legislation and international cooperation. Currently, 
the Convention has forty-seven national signatories, thirty ratifications, and is the 
primary legal instrument available to nation-states with respect to cyber security.86
At the level of national security, the most visible changes in cyber defense strat-
egy have taken place within the U.S. military. A turning point occurred in 2008, 
when unknown hackers successfully compromised classified military systems in the 
“most significant breach” of U.S. military computers ever.
U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense William J. Lynn wrote in Foreign Affairs that ad-
versaries now have the power to disrupt critical U.S. information infrastructure, and 
that the asymmetric nature of hacking means that a “dozen” computer program-
mers can pose a national security threat. Over the long term, Lynn believed that 
computer hacking can lead to the loss of enough intellectual property to deprive a 
nation of its economic vitality.
The most tangible U.S. response has been the creation of its military Cyber Com-
mand in 2010. USCYBERCOM has three primary missions: computer network de-
fense, the coordination of national cyber warfare resources, and cyber security 
liaison with domestic and foreign partners. Its first mission, defense, relies on a 
combination of traditional best practices in computer security and classified intel-
ligence threat information, to create a unique, “active” U.S. cyber defense posture.87
The quest for strategic cyber defense took its most recent step forward in Lisbon, 
Portugal, in November 2010, where twenty-eight national leaders from the world’s 
foremost political and military alliance published a new “Strategic Concept” for the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
This document clearly illustrates the rapid rise in the perceived connection between 
computer security and national security. The previous Strategic Concept, written in 
1999, did not contain a single mention of computers, networks, or hackers. The new 
document, entitled “Active Engagement, Modern Defence,” describes cyber attacks 
as “frequent, organized, and costly,” and having now reached a threshold where they 
threaten “national and Euro-Atlantic prosperity, security and stability.”
If NATO hopes to defend the cyber domain, it must improve its ability to prevent, 
detect, counter and recover from cyber attacks. At a minimum, this requires placing

all NATO bodies under centralized cyber protection, upgrading member state cyber 
defense capabilities, and coordinating the efforts of national and organizational cy-
ber security resources.88
In fact, NATO may be the best place to begin answering the national security chal-
lenge posed by cyber attacks. The Internet is now an international asset. As such, 
threats to it require an international response. As a large group of affluent nations 
with a shared political and military agenda,89 it is possible that NATO today could 
deal a significant blow to one of a hacker’s greatest advantages – anonymity.90
More Questions than Answers
Although the first modern computer was designed at Cambridge in 1837, in many 
ways the Information Revolution has just begun. The World Wide Web, for example, 
is just twenty years old.91
As our use of and dependence on the Internet have grown, however, computer secu-
rity has quickly evolved from a purely technical discipline to a geopolitical strategic 
concept. At the 2010 NATO Summit in Lisbon, twenty-eight world leaders declared 
that cyber attacks now threaten international prosperity, security, and stability.
Moreover, in the future the consequences of a cyber attack may rise because the 
threat will affect national critical infrastructures of every kind. In our homes, the 
use of “smart grid” networks is proliferating. And in our militaries, the production of 
IP-enabled munitions, such as unmanned aircraft, is outpacing that of their manned 
counterparts, meaning that even warfare is now managed remotely via the Inter-
net.92
As national security thinkers attempt to defend their interests in cyberspace, a key 
to success will be to bridge the gap between cyber strategy and cyber tactics. Goals 
such as the security of national critical infrastructures and strategies like military 
deterrence and arms control demand a greater appreciation for the capabilities and 
challenges of computer scientists, who fight their battles on the front lines of cryp-
tography, intrusion detection, reverse engineering, and other highly technical dis-
ciplines.

in Lisbon, but for emerging policies to reflect technical realities, policymakers must 
return to Cambridge.

Cyber Security: A Technical Primer
3. CYBER SECURITY: A TECHNICAL PRIMER
Chapter 2 demonstrated that cyber security has evolved from a purely technical dis-
cipline to a strategic, geopolitical concept that can directly impact national security. 
Nonetheless, at the tactical level cyber security remains a highly technical discipline 
that is difficult to understand for those without a formal education in computer sci-
ence or information technology.
Therefore, before this research examines the real-world impact of cyber attacks and 
explores strategic threat mitigation strategies, Chapter 3 will introduce the reader to 
the basics of cyber security analysis, macro-scale hacking, the case-study of Saudi 
Arabia, and cyber defense exercises.  Hopefully, a greater appreciation for the chal-
lenges of computer science will help policy makers to bridge the gap between tacti-
cal and strategic cyber security thinking.
Cyber Security Analysis
To introduce the reader to the topic of cyber security analysis, the author will briefly 
analyze his own personal firewall log.93
Almost everyone today has a personal or “host” firewall installed on his or her com-
puter. It protects both the computer and its user from unwanted network activ-
ity. Technically speaking, it accepts or rejects incoming data “packets.” Professional 
computer security analysts examine the log files, or recorded events, of firewalls 
and other computing devices for signs of suspicious activity.
Most of the recorded network traffic is non-malicious even if it may be unsolicited 
and unwanted. For example, an Internet Service Provider (ISP) may “scan” its cli-
ents’ computers for policy violations such as hosting an unauthorized Web server. 
Businesses go to extraordinary and sometimes unethical lengths to gather in-depth 
information about computers and their users, such as which operating system they 
use and what type of movies they prefer, for advertising purposes.
Firewall logs can be viewed in many different ways. A security analyst can sort them 
by country, for example, to identify blocked traffic by world geography.94

This analysis is of a Zone Alarm personal firewall log that contains 12,700 record entries from 31 
DEC 2000 to 23 JAN 2003.
