    from fastapi import FastAPI
### Description
We have a test that does something like this:
    now = utc_datetime()
    url = client.app.url_path_for("balances")
    start_date = now - timedelta(minutes=1)
    start_date_param = urlencode({"start_date": start_date.isoformat()})
    end_date_param = urlencode({"end_date": now.isoformat()})
    response = client.get(url + f"?{start_date_param}&{end_date_param}")
With FastAPI 0.86 everything works. Starting from 0.87 (which uses `starlette`
0.21.0) our endpoint errors with:
    {'error': {'code': 'validation_error', 'message': 'Validation Error', 'errors': [{'attribute': 'query -> start_date', 'code': 'value_error.datetime', 'message': 'invalid datetime format', 'ctx': None}, {'attribute': 'query -> end_date', 'code': 'value_error.datetime', 'message': 'invalid datetime format', 'ctx': None}]}}
If I force the installation of `starlette` 0.22.0 and rerun the test,
everything works. This is a known bug of `starlette` 0.21.0 and it has been
fixed in 0.22.0:

  * https://github.com/encode/starlette/releases/tag/0.22.0
## Solution
Bump `starlette` version in FastAPI to 0.22.0

I can make this small PR with the update as soon as you confirm/acknowledge
