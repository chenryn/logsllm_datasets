User: I am developing web service. My system is like this:

Client request --> Web Server(Apache) --> Application Server(Python)

I used WSGI for communicating between Apache and Python.
My question how can I separated the web server and app server. At the moment, I have to run them on the same server.
Assistant: WSGI is not a network protocol, so you will have to run a web server in front of your application even if it only acts as a WSGI container. Proxy connections from your main web server to the WSGI container with mod_proxy.
