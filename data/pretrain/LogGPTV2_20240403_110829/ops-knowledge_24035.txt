User: Sometime I look back at my terminal when there is a python script running and the console output has frozen, then I right-click on the terminal and the console output (printing to screen) beings again.  
Its a bit disconcerting because sometimes I think my script has broken.
Do others also experience this?  Anybody know a fix?
Thanks in advance for any responses
Assistant: If it's intermittent with all other factors being unchanged, it sounds like you've inadvertently selected some text in the PowerShell console and it's halted updating output so that you can do something with it.
Next time, be careful to look to see if you have something selected before clicking.
