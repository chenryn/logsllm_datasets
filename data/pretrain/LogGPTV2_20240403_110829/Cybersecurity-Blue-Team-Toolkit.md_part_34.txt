::: section
[]{#c14.xhtml#c14-sec-0004}
1.  [The file you just downloaded ends with the extension `.7z`. 7‐zip
    is open source and free software that is a file archiver that
    utilizes a high compression ratio. To download the 7‐Zip software
    for Windows, go to `www.7-zip.org`. Like you see in [Figure
    14.7](#c14.xhtml#c14-fig-0007){#c14.xhtml#R_c14-fig-0007}, you have
    a choice between 32‐bit and 64‐bit architecture. It is a teeny tiny
    file, so it takes only a few seconds to download. Double‐click the
    7‐zip icon and install the software.]{#c14.xhtml#c14-li-0012}

    download of Kali Linux. Right‐click the file and choose 7zip And
    Extract Here. This will unpack the zipped file create folder with
    the VM inside.]{#c14.xhtml#c14-li-0013}
3.  [Open your VMware Workstation Player and choose the Open A VM
    option. When the Open dialog box opens, navigate to the proper
    folder and, like you see in [Figure
    14.8](#c14.xhtml#c14-fig-0008){#c14.xhtml#R_c14-fig-0008}, the Kali
    Linux VM will be an option. Select the folder and then click
    Open.]{#c14.xhtml#c14-li-0014}
    ![[**[Figure

    VM](Images/c14f008.jpg){.center width="701" height="471"}
4.  [Once the Kali Linux VM is open, you will have several options. As
    you see in [Figure
    14.9](#c14.xhtml#c14-fig-0009){#c14.xhtml#R_c14-fig-0009}, you have
    the ability to power on the VM or edit the settings. If you click
    the Edit VM Settings link, you will be able to allocate more
    resources to the virtual environment before you hit the Play
    button.[]{#c14.xhtml#Page_214 .pagebreak title="214"

    settings](Images/c14f009.jpg){.center width="695" height="601"}
5.  [In [Figure
    14.10](#c14.xhtml#c14-fig-0010){#c14.xhtml#R_c14-fig-0010}, you see
    the Hardware tab. The default configuration of 2 GB of memory, four
    processors, a 80 GB hard drive, a CD/DVD that will auto‐detect if
    one is installed on your host and a NAT network adapter. For most
    workloads, CPU virtualization adds only a small amount of overhead,
    which means it will be very close to what you see on a bare‐metal
    installation. The host operating system will not perform very well
    when it runs low on memory, so be careful about giving yourself too
    much memory. If the host OS doesn\'t have enough memory for itself,
    it can cause thrashing, constantly swapping data between memory and
    the paging file on disk. If you want this VM to connect to the
    Internet using the host\'s network, NAT is often the easiest way to
    go. The sound card and display will auto‐detect unless you make a
    change. Take note of the defaults currently displayed for future
    performance tuning.[]{#c14.xhtml#Page_215 .pagebreak title="215"
    role="doc-pagebreak"}]{#c14.xhtml#c14-li-0016}

    Kali Linux](Images/c14f010.jpg){.center width="703" height="682"}
6.  [The next tab to the right of Hardware is Options. The options for
    your Kali Linux VM include giving the VM a new name, using power
    options such as entering full‐screen mode when the VM is ready to be
    powered on, and enabling or disabling folders. Considering this is
    Kali Linux and you will be compromising machines, I usually disable
    this. Shared folders will expose your host files to programs in the
    VM. In [Figure
    14.11](#c14.xhtml#c14-fig-0011){#c14.xhtml#R_c14-fig-0011}, you see
    the option to disable shared folders or enable if you trust the VM
    with the data you have stored on the host. Edit your Power options
    to enter full‐screen mode after powering on by selecting the box to
    the left and clicking OK.[]{#c14.xhtml#Page_216 .pagebreak

    folders](Images/c14f011.jpg){.center width="703" height="685"}
7.  [The only other viable option to consider is Unity. Unity in VMware
    is the ability to display applications directly on the host desktop.
    The VM console is hidden, and you can minimize the Workstation
    window. If you\'re feeling really fancy, you can change the border
    color around the applications that run in Unity mode on the desktop,
    as shown in [Figure
    14.12](#c14.xhtml#c14-fig-0012){#c14.xhtml#R_c14-fig-0012}.[]{#c14.xhtml#Page_217

8.  [Click the OK or Cancel button after you have made your VM
    modifications, and from the Home page, click the Play Virtual
    Machine green triangle. You will see the Kali Linux machine spin up.
    The first time you spin up this VM, it may ask if you moved it or
    copied it. Select the I Copied It option. "It" is the VM you have
    created or downloaded.]{#c14.xhtml#c14-li-0019}
9.  [When the Kali Linux VM is ready, you will see the login screen
    that\'s shown in [Figure
    14.13](#c14.xhtml#c14-fig-0013){#c14.xhtml#R_c14-fig-0013}. The
    default username is **root**, and the password is

10. [If the screensaver pops up while you are reading or otherwise
    engaged, just press the Esc button on your keyboard. I like to see
    my VM in full screen on my auxiliary screen, leaving one monitor
    dedicated to Windows and one dedicated to Kali Linux, like you see

## Optimizing Kali Linux {#c14.xhtml#head-2-106}
One of the first things I do as a habit is update Kali Linux every
single time I open it up. Offensive Security pulls updates from Debian
four times a day. This ensures patches and updates are getting
incorporated into Kali Linux on a daily basis. Keep your system
up‐to‐date and make it part of your routine. As soon as the OS loads,
open a terminal, and run `apt‐get update`, as shown in [Figure
14.15](#c14.xhtml#c14-fig-0015){#c14.xhtml#R_c14-fig-0015}. When that
process completes and you get your command prompt back, run
`apt‐get dist‐upgrade` (also shown in [Figure
14.15](#c14.xhtml#c14-fig-0015)).
![[**[Figure 14.15](#c14.xhtml#R_c14-fig-0015){#c14.xhtml#c14-fig-0015
role="doc-backlink"}:**]{.figureLabel} Updating Kali Linux through a
terminal](Images/c14f015.jpg){.center width="636" height="416"}
Next, think about the credentials you used to log into this VM of Kali
Linux. Those are root credentials. This book has cautioned you with a
discussion on least privileges. Adding a nonroot user to Kali Linux is
pretty easy. You can still use the root/toor credentials as needed. As
you can see in [Figure
14.16](#c14.xhtml#c14-fig-0016){#c14.xhtml#R_c14-fig-0016}, the commands
to add a user and password are simply `useradd ‐m nt ‐G ‐s /bin/bash`
and `passwd nt`, respectively.
![[**[Figure 14.16](#c14.xhtml#R_c14-fig-0016){#c14.xhtml#c14-fig-0016
role="doc-backlink"}:**]{.figureLabel} Adding a nonroot username and
password](Images/c14f016.jpg){.center width="646" height="265"}
You will probably want to use your name or initials, not mine (even
though mine are pretty awesome considering I\'m in IT). Be cognizant of
using any information or credentials that someone else could use
nefariously.
You also might want to consider disabling the screen lock feature. The
easiest and fastest way to disable the screen lock feature is to
navigate the menu on the left to the very bottom. There is an icon of
nine dots, which is your Show []{#c14.xhtml#Page_220 .pagebreak
title="220" role="doc-pagebreak"}Applications icon. At the top of the
window is the Search field. Type **Settings**, navigate toward the
bottom of the page, and choose Power. Like you see in [Figure
14.17](#c14.xhtml#c14-fig-0017){#c14.xhtml#R_c14-fig-0017}, choose Never
as the Blank Screen option.
![[**[Figure 14.17](#c14.xhtml#R_c14-fig-0017){#c14.xhtml#c14-fig-0017
role="doc-backlink"}:**]{.figureLabel} Turning off the Blank screen
saver](Images/c14f017.jpg){.center width="655" height="492"}
The next feature you might want to disable is the Automatic Screen Lock.
You will find this under Privacy in the Settings menu, as shown in
[Figure 14.18](#c14.xhtml#c14-fig-0018){#c14.xhtml#R_c14-fig-0018}.

## Using Kali Linux Tools {#c14.xhtml#head-2-107}
Some of the tools in Kali Linux have been discussed in previous chapters
of this book---including NMAP, Burp, Wireshark, Social Engineer Toolkit,
and Metasploit Framework---but there are so many more. Here are some of
my favorites out of hundreds that are extremely specialized but can be
put in the following categories:
-   [Information gathering]{#c14.xhtml#c14-li-0022}
    -   [Maltego]{#c14.xhtml#c14-li-0023}
    -   [Recon‐ng]{#c14.xhtml#c14-li-0024}
    -   [Sparta]{#c14.xhtml#c14-li-0025}
-   [Utilities]{#c14.xhtml#c14-li-0026}
    -   [MacChanger]{#c14.xhtml#c14-li-0027}
    -   [Nikto]{#c14.xhtml#c14-li-0028}
-   [[]{#c14.xhtml#Page_222 .pagebreak title="222"
    role="doc-pagebreak"}Wireless]{#c14.xhtml#c14-li-0029}
    -   [Kismet]{#c14.xhtml#c14-li-0030}
    -   [WiFite]{#c14.xhtml#c14-li-0031}
-   [Brute forcing]{#c14.xhtml#c14-li-0032}
    -   [John the Ripper]{#c14.xhtml#c14-li-0033}
    -   [Hashcat]{#c14.xhtml#c14-li-0034}
With these tools, you can test your computer system security using the
same techniques that an attacker would. Kali Linux is specifically built
to meet the requirements of security auditing and specifically geared
toward security specialists. It is not a general‐purpose operating
system and should be used only while working toward achieving your
security requirements.
As you see in [Figure
14.19](#c14.xhtml#c14-fig-0019){#c14.xhtml#R_c14-fig-0019}, by clicking
Applications in the upper‐left corner, the menu that drops down already
breaks down the tools into different genres such as information
gathering, password attacks, and forensics. Explore the menus in your
own Kali Linux instance to get familiar with the names of the tools and
recognize the placement of those you already know.

### Maltego {#c14.xhtml#head-3-5}
In the beginning of any type of penetration test or campaign, you want
to use your tools to gather as much information as you can. Maltego is
one of the best. When you go to Applications ⇨ Information Gathering ⇨
Maltego, as []{#c14.xhtml#Page_223 .pagebreak title="223"
role="doc-pagebreak"}shown in [Figure
14.20](#c14.xhtml#c14-fig-0020){#c14.xhtml#R_c14-fig-0020}, you have
several choices that require a key. But there is a Community Edition,
which you can access by clicking the Run button under Maltego CE (Free).
![[**[Figure 14.20](#c14.xhtml#R_c14-fig-0020){#c14.xhtml#c14-fig-0020
role="doc-backlink"}:**]{.figureLabel} Starting Maltego CE in Kali
Linux](Images/c14f020.jpg){.center width="654" height="479"}
After you have created a user login for Maltego, you will be able to
fully utilize the features. As you see in [Figure
14.21](#c14.xhtml#c14-fig-0021){#c14.xhtml#R_c14-fig-0021}, after
logging in, you will access Maltego and have a choice to build a new
graphic interface or use an example to get familiar. This is the default
example of what data mining looks like. Maltego renders graphs full of
links based on relationships between pieces of data sprinkled across the
Internet. Maltego uses the visual node representation to assist you in
finding the information that is out in the wild that could possibly be
used to compromise your environment. There is no graphical export in the
community version, but the data is still there at your fingertips.

### Recon‐ng {#c14.xhtml#head-3-6}
While Maltego is one of my favorite ways to present the data, Recon‐ng
is a tool written by one of my favorite organizations: Black Hills
InfoSec. Recon‐ng is a Python web reconnaissance framework. It has
modules, database interaction, and built‐in functions to help you gather
information. It looks like Metasploit and SET to reduce the learning
curve, but even with the obvious simplicity, it is a rather complex
