Inspired by this observation, we construct a feature space
that speciﬁcally reﬂects these states of consumption data. In
particular, we employ a grid of g bins that spans the range
of observable consumption values. Using this grid we deﬁne
an indicator function Ij,k
(cid:40)
Figure 4: Schematic depiction of data analysis:
(a) distance to mean; (b) separating hyperplane.
Before presenting this data analysis framework, we intro-
duce some basic notation. We refer to the known consump-
tion trace of a consumer by X = {x1, . . . , xn}, where X
covers n days and each xi corresponds to the measurements
of one day. Depending on the resolution d of Smart Meter-
ing, each xi is represented by a vector of d dimensions
xi =(cid:0)m1, . . . , md
(cid:1),
where mj is the consumption measured at the j-th time slot
of the Smart Metering resolution. Moreover, if we consider
a grid of g bins associated with consumption values, we say
that mj falls into bin k, if mj has the smallest diﬀerence to
the consumption value associated with the k-th bin.
4.1 A Binary Feature Space
Mapping consumption traces to a vector space may seem
trivial at a ﬁrst glance, as the measurements of a day are
already represented as a d-dimensional vector. However, for
discriminating diﬀerent patterns in this data, we require a
more advanced representation that emphasizes the charac-
teristics of each consumer and provides an expressive basis
for application of machine learning.
Depending on the setup of electronic devices in a house-
hold, the consumption of a consumer changes between dif-
ferent states. Devices are switched on and oﬀ; thereby the
that returns 1, if the j-th measurement of a day x falls into
the k-th bin of our grid, and 0 otherwise.
If we compute the indicator function Ij,k for all d mea-
surements of a day and all g bins of the grid, we obtain a
mapping
φ : X (cid:55)→ Rd·g, φ(x) =(cid:0)Ij,k(x)(cid:1)
1≤j≤d
1≤k≤g
(2)
that maps the consumption of one day to a binary feature
space with d · g dimensions. For example, if we have one
measurement per hour, that is d = 24, and use a grid with
g = 100, we embed the data in a feature space of 2,400 bi-
nary features, each corresponding to a particular consump-
tion value at a particular hour. In contrast to a naive rep-
resentation with d dimensions, this feature space describes
states independently of absolute diﬀerences. That is, each
state change induced by the consumer is treated equally,
whether it involves switching on a small desk lamp or a pow-
erful washing machine. For the experiments in Section 5, we
consider d = 24 and make use of a grid with 100 bins of con-
sumption values.
4.2 Anomaly Detection
By embedding the consumption traces into an expressive
feature space, we are able to phrase our attacks in terms of
geometric relationships between data points. For determin-
ing unusual activity in the data of a consumer we employ a
standard technique for detecting geometric outliers. Given
a consumption trace of n consecutive days, we ﬁrst learn a
µφ(z)w+−0369121518210500100015002000Time of dayConsumption (W/h)Similarly to the anomaly detection, there exists several ef-
ﬁcient libraries for computing SVMs. In our experiments,
we make use of LibLinear [4]—a library capable of learning
with millions of dimensions and data points.
5. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION
To study the impact of our attacks in practice, we conduct
experiments using anonymized consumption traces for 53
households. The data stretches over 221 days and has a
resolution of one value per hour. The goal of the experiments
is to demonstrate the eﬃcacy of the two attacks described
in Section 3. However, due to privacy reasons we do not
have identity data for the consumption traces and therefore
cannot fully implement the LA attack. Yet, we can identify
signiﬁcant anomalies in the consumption trace that could
greatly help in linking identities to pseudonyms.
5.1
Identiﬁcation of Anomalies
In our ﬁrst experiment, we apply the technique of anomaly
detection to each of the 53 consumers. We are interested in
identifying days that stand out of regular energy consump-
tion and might provide a good basis for linking the consump-
tion data with an external data source.

proﬁle of normal activity by computing the mean µ of the
data in the feature space as follows
n(cid:88)
i=1
µ =

n
φ(xi).
(3)
The proﬁle µ captures the states shared by the majority of
the consumption traces. As each vectors φ(xi) contains only
binary values, each dimensions of µ can be interpreted as the
probability for observing a particular grid value at particular
time of the day. Geometrically, the deviation of a day z
from this proﬁle can be determined by simply computing
the distance
d(z) = ||φ(z) − µ||.
(4)
Note that d(z) corresponds to the Euclidean distance in the
vector space and can be eﬃciently computed with standard
software libraries. This generic approach to anomaly de-
tection is illustrated in Figure 4(a).
If we notice a large
distance d(z) for a day z, some of the consumption states of
this day diﬀer from normal activity and z is likely to contain
an anomalous event.
This technique for computing proﬁles can also be applied
to compare diﬀerent sets of consumption traces. For ex-
ample, if we have two reference sets X1 and X2 from the
same consumer, we can compute two mean values µ1 and µ2
and compare the distance to both. This setting allows us to
study diﬀerent classes of days during analysis, as shown in
Section 5 for weekdays and weekends.
4.3 Classiﬁcation
For linking by behavior pattern, we aim at inferring pat-
terns from the consumption trace of a consumer. However,
we are not interested in modelling the complete behavior
of a consumer, but determining patterns that discriminate
his behavior from others. Thus, we employ the technique of
classiﬁcation and learn a discrimination between users. A
robust method for learning such a discrimination is a Sup-
port Vector Machine (SVM) [2, 16]. An SVM basically de-
termines a hyperplane in the feature space that separates
two classes with maximum margin. This geometric concept
is illustrated in Figure 4(b). The hyperplane is constructed
as a linear combination of the training data and separates
the consumption trace of one consumer c from all others.
Formally, this hyperplane is given by a direction vector
n(cid:88)
wc =
yiαiφ(xi)
(5)
i=1
and an oﬀset term bc, where yi ∈ {−1, +1} are training
labels indicating whether day xi corresponds to consumer c
and αi are the learned coeﬃcients.
To account for multiple consumers, we make use of the
one-against-all approach and learn a hyperplane for each
consumer separating him from the rest of users. The dis-
crimination function for each consumer is then given by
hc(z) = (cid:104)φ(z), wc(cid:105) + bc.
(6)
The function hc(z) reﬂects the distance from day z to the hy-
perplane of consumer c. The more consumption states and
patterns are shared with c, the higher hc(z) gets. Hence,
if we want to link a day z to a consumer, we simply as-
sign it to those consumer c with the largest value for hc(z).
(b) Anomaly detected for consumer 49.

The shaded area indicates the standard deviation.
Figure 6(a) shows exceptionally high energy consumption
throughout the day, probably in the course of Christmas
preparations. Depending on the amount of time this con-
sumption trace spans this could mean diﬀerent things: If
the trace spans several years (which our speciﬁc data source
does not) this would indicate that this consumer has not has
had such extensive Christmas preparations because he/she
previously went away for Christmas or celebrates Christmas
for the ﬁrst time at home. As this particular trace only

that the 25th of December means something special to this
household, which could in turn indicate that it is Christian.
Depending on the context of this household this could mean
incriminating information.
Figure 6(b) displays how a consumer apparently starts
energy consumption shortly before 9 o’clock. This may in-
dicate that the consumer has moved in and started the ﬁrst
electric devices in his new apartment. In the afternoon ex-
ceptionally high load can be observed, consistent with the
use of machines by craftsmen.
If one could correlate this
data with data sources that hold information about moving
households in this region this could lead to the identiﬁcation
of the inhabitants.
While we have shown only two strong anomalies from our
data set, several others can be identiﬁed for the consumers.
Provided external reference data, it is trivial to correlate
these anomalies with unusual events and there is a realistic
chance of unlinking pseudonyms.
As mentioned in Section 3.1, anomalies can also be iden-
tiﬁed using diﬀerent proﬁles of consumption. In this second
experiment, the consumption on workdays and weekends are
analyzed to determine whether the household inhabitants
stay or leave home. In particular, we compare the proﬁle
of weekends and workdays to identify workdays that match
the consumption behavior of weekends.
It is notable that for the given resolution of Smart Me-
tering accurate proﬁles can be learned for the consumption
data. While we have shown examples for comparing week-
ends and weekdays, several other scenarios exist that would
allow to further structure and analyze the electricity con-
sumption of a household. Together with the anomaly de-
tection, these analysis steps clearly allow to narrow down
the search for a particular identity and help to unlink its
pseudonym.
5.2 Linking by Behavior Pattern
In this experiment we conduct the LP attack by using
the classiﬁcation technique from Section 4.3 to determine
whether consumption traces have the same origin house-
hold. We use one time interval of our consumption trace
database for training our machine learning framework and
subsequently provided it with test data from a diﬀerent, non-
overlapping time interval. The algorithm implemented by
the framework then tries to link consumption traces that
behave similarly. We measure its accuracy by the relative
frequency of correct linking decisions.

(b) Proﬁles for consumer 40 and “day-oﬀ”.

The red line indicates a potential “day oﬀ ”.
Figure 7(a) displays how usual workday and weekend pro-
ﬁle look like for a consumer. For the 24th of May however,
we can identify a day that matches a weekend day judging
by its energy consumption but is a Monday (workday). Fig-
ure 7(b) shows the same for another consumer for the 7th
of December 2009 which is a Thursday.
(b) Per-consumer accuracy for 14 days of test data.

test data (a) and individual users (b).
Figure 8(a) displays linking accuracies for training data
of 60 days in dependency of test data size, where we as-
sume ﬁxed pseudonyms during the given time spans. The
graph steadily climbs to over 90% accuracy for 30 days of
test data. Figure 8(b) represents a breakdown of the linking
accuracy for testing data of 14 days. For several pseudonyms
an almost perfect unlinking is possible and on average an ac-
curacy of 83% is attained, corresponding to 5 correct iden-
tiﬁcations out of 6 consumers. Note that pseudonym 30 un-
dergoes signiﬁcant perturbations over the course of our data

zero accuracy.
Figure 9 displays the accuracy of our approach depending
on the sizes of the training set and the test data in days.
One can see, that the size of the test data has a slightly
stronger impact on the accuracy then the size of the training
data. Overall, the accuracy reaches approximately 83% if
the training and test data is larger than 28 days. As a
result, our attack is even eﬀective if a re-pseudonymization
is conducted every month.

on classiﬁcation accuracy.
6. MITIGATION TECHNIQUES
We ﬁnally investigate in this section three mitigation al-
ternatives and their ability to contain and mitigate the afore-
mentioned attacks.
6.1 Lower Resolution
A simple yet promising approach to mitigating our attacks
is to lower the resolution of Smart Metering. The idea be-
hind is that consumption traces are blurred and therefore
anomalies and patterns are covered.
In order to evaluate
this mitigation technique we scale the consumption traces
down in several steps and executed our experiments on the
down-scaled data.
Figure 10 represents our anomaly detection for resolutions
of 6, 3 or 1 value per day for the anomaly that was identiﬁed
in Figure 6(a). One can see that the anomaly remains visi-
ble, even if the Smart Meter only records one value per day.
The reason for this is that the anomaly spanned a larger part
of the day and hence had a high impact on the total energy
consumption of that day. Figure 11 shows an anomaly that
behaves diﬀerently. While for resolutions of 6 or 3 values per
day the anomaly still can be identiﬁed, it is not recognizable
in the 1 value per day.
Regarding the LP attack the reduction of Smart Metering
resolution has a bigger eﬀect. Figure 12 shows the linking
accuracy in dependency of the test data size for diﬀerent
resolutions.
In contrast to Figure 9 the linking accuracy
drops signiﬁcantly with a reduction of the resolution. While
the accuracy still reaches almost 70% for 8 measurements
per day it drops to approx. 4% for one measurement a day.
These results show that a reduction of the Smart Meter-
ing resolution has mixed eﬀects on our attacks. For anomaly
detection (and subsequent anomaly linking) the attacker
will probably be still quite successful if he manages to ﬁnd
Figure 12: Classiﬁcation accuracy with diﬀerent res-
olution. The accuracy is given for resolutions of 8
((cid:46)), 6 ((cid:47)), 3 (◦) and 1 ((cid:3)) value per day.
anomalies that have a big impact on the total energy con-
sumption. However, short bursts of energy consumption will
not be recognizable at low resolutions. Moreover, our results
show that the LP attack can be successfully mitigated. The
linking accuracy drops signiﬁcantly with every reduction of
the resolution.
Whether lower resolutions are a viable mitigation also de-
pend on the supplier’s requirements: The resolution of real-
time tariﬀs and time-of-use prices is limited by the chosen
Smart Metering resolutions.
6.2 Frequent Re-pseudonymization
Re-pseudonymization could be considered another miti-
gation technique. The holder of the identity and consump-
tion databases introduces new pseudonyms for identities ev-
ery now and then. Subsequently arriving consumption trace
items of a household will be recorded under the new pseudonym.
This leads to the eﬀect that a holder of only the consump-
tion trace database has only short intervals of data per
pseudonym. Which means, that the training set for the LP
attack is limited by the re-pseudonymization time frame.
If we assume that the attacker tries to track origins of con-
