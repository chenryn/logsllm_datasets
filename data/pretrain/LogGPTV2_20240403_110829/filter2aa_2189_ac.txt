Sun Tzu did not know that baggage trains would one day need functioning 
computers and uncompromised computer code to deliver their supplies on 
time. 
Specific tactical advice from Art of War provides a clear example. As 
in the Syrian air defense attack cited above, Sun Tzu instructs military com-
manders to accomplish something for which digital denial-of-service (DoS) 
appears ideal: to sever communications between adversary military forces. 
Those who were called skillful leaders of old knew how to 
drive a wedge between the enemy‟s front and rear; to prevent 
co-operation between his large and small divisions; to hinder 
the good troops from rescuing the bad, the officers from rally-
ing their men. AoW: XI. The Nine Situations 
If modern military forces use the Internet as their primary means of communi-
cation, what happens when the Internet is down? Thus it is likely that cyber 
attacks will play their most critical role when launched in concert with a con-
ventional military (or terrorist) attack. 
Sun Tzu warns that surprise attacks may come when a defender‟s level 
of alert is lowest: 
Now a soldier‟s spirit is keenest in the morning; by noonday it 
has begun to flag; and in the evening, his mind is bent only on 
returning to camp. A clever general, therefore, avoids an army 
when its spirit is keen, but attacks it when it is sluggish and in-
clined to return. This is the art of studying moods. AoW: VII. 
Maneuvering 
CCD CoE · February 9, 2011 
Cyber criminals already operate according to this rule. They know the work 
schedules of network security personnel, and often launch attacks in the even-
ing, on weekends or on holidays, when their adversaries are at home. 
If an invasion is successful, Sun Tzu advises military commanders to 
survive as much as possible on the adversary‟s own resources. 
Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy. 
One cartload of the enemy‟s provisions is equivalent to twenty 
of one‟s own, and likewise a single picul of his provender is 
equivalent to twenty from one‟s own store. AoW: II. Waging 
War 
In this sense, Art of War and cyber warfare correspond perfectly. In computer 
hacking, attackers typically steal the credentials and privileges of an author-
ized user, after which they effectively become an insider, in the adversary‟s 
(virtual) uniform. At that point, inflicting further damage on the network – and 
thus on the people using that network and their mission – through DoS or es-
pionage is far easier. Such attacks could include poisoned pen correspondence 
and/or critical data modification. Even if the compromise is discovered and 
contained, adversary leadership may lose its trust in the computer network, 
and cease to use it voluntarily. 
Finally, cyber warfare is no different from other military disciplines in 
that the success of an attack will depend on keeping its mission details a secret. 
O divine art of subtlety and secrecy! Through you we learn to 
be invisible, through you inaudible; and hence we can hold the 
enemy‟s fate in our hands. AoW: VI. Weak Points and Strong 
In military jargon, this is called operational security (OPSEC). However, the 
characteristics that make cyber warfare possible – the ubiquity and intercon-
CCD CoE · February 9, 2011 
nected nature of the Internet – ironically make good OPSEC more difficult 
than ever to achieve. Open source intelligence (OSINT) and computer hacking 
can benefit cyber defense as much as cyber offense. 
The Ideal Commander 
Decision-making in a national security context carries significant responsibili-
ties because lives are often at stake. Thus, on a personal level, Art of War 
leadership requirements are high. 
The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity, 
benevolence, courage and strictness. AoW: I. Laying Plans 
Good leaders not only exploit flawed plans but flawed adversaries (Parks and 
Duggan, 2001). Discipline and self-control are encouraged; emotion and per-
sonal desire are discouraged.7 Sun Tzu states that to avoid a superior adversary 
is not cowardice, but wisdom (Sawyer, 1994), and due to the painstaking na-
ture of objective calculations, patience is a virtue. 
Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle 
after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to 
defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory. AoW: IV. 
Tactical Dispositions 
Commanding a cyber corps will require a healthy mix of these admira-
ble qualities. As a battleground, cyberspace offers political and military lead-
ers almost limitless possibilities for success – and failure. Behind its façade of 
global connectivity and influence, the Internet has a complicated and vulnera-
ble architecture that is an ideal environment in which to conduct asymmetric

and often anonymous military operations. Imagination and creativity are re-
quired skill sets. Cyber warfare also involves an enormous amount of uncer-
tainty: even knowing whether one is under attack can be an immense chal-
lenge. And the high tempo of Internet operations may lead to a high burn-out 
rate throughout the ranks. 
A cyber commander must have a minimum level of subject matter ex-
pertise in IT. The core concepts of computing, networking, and data security 
should be thoroughly understood before employing them in support of a na-
tional security agenda. Any leader must be able to articulate the mission so 
that everyone in the organization understands and believes in it (Rarick, 1996); 
a further challenge in cyber warfare will be communicating with highly tech-
nical personalities who have vastly different personal needs than the soldiers 
of a traditional military element. 
In all future wars, military leadership will have the challenge of coor-
dinating and deconflicting the cyber and non-cyber elements of a battle plan. 
Sun Tzu gives high praise for a great tactician: 
Having collected an army and concentrated his forces, he must 
blend and harmonize the different elements thereof before 
pitching his camp. After that, comes tactical maneuvering, than 
which there is nothing more difficult. The difficulty of tactical 
maneuvering consists in turning the devious into the direct, and 
misfortune into gain. AoW: VII. Maneuvering 
As circumstances change throughout the course of a conflict, both tactics and 
strategy must be reevaluated and modified to fit the new environment (Rarick, 
1996). 
CCD CoE · February 9, 2011 
He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and 
thereby succeed in winning, may be called a heaven-born cap-
tain. AoW: VI. Weak Points and Strong 
The dynamic nature of the Internet and the speed of computer network opera-
tions guarantee that traditional military challenges such as seizing the initiative 
and maintaining momentum will require faster decision cycles than a tradi-
tional chain-of-command can manage. A cyber commander must have the 
ability and the trust of his or her superiors to act quickly, creatively, and deci-
sively. 
Art of Cyber War: Elements of a New Framework 
Art of War is the most influential military treatise in human history. The book 
has survived over 2,500 years in part because its guidance is highly flexible: 
strategists and tacticians have adapted Art of War to new circumstances across 
many scientific revolutions, and Sun Tzu‟s insight has never lost much of its 
resonance. 
This paper argues that in the future, cyber warfare practitioners should 
also use Art of War as an essential guide to military strategy. However, cyber-
space possesses many characteristics that are unlike anything Sun Tzu could 
have imagined in ancient China. There are at least ten distinctive aspects of the 
cyber battlefield. 
1. The Internet is an artificial environment that can be shaped in part ac-
cording to national security requirements. 
2. The rapid proliferation of Internet technologies, including hacker tools 
and tactics, makes it impossible for any organization to be familiar 
with all of them. 
CCD CoE · February 9, 2011 
3. The physical proximity of adversaries loses much of its relevance as 
cyber attacks are launched without regard to terrestrial geography. 
4. Frequent software updates and network reconfiguration change Internet 
geography unpredictably and without warning. 
5. In a reversal of our historical understanding of warfare, the asymmetric 
nature of cyber attacks strongly favors the attacker. 
6. Cyber attacks are more flexible than any weapon the world has seen: 
they can be used for propaganda, espionage, and the destruction of 
critical infrastructure. 
7. Cyber attacks can be conducted with such a high degree of anonymity 
that defense strategies such as deterrence and retaliation are not credi-
ble. 
8. It is possible that a lengthy and costly cyber war could take place with-
out anyone but the direct participants knowing about it (Libicki, 2009). 
9. The intangible nature of cyberspace can make the calculation of victo-
ry, defeat, and battle damage a highly subjective undertaking. 
10. There are few moral inhibitions to cyber warfare because it relates 
primarily to the use and exploitation of information in the form of 
computer code and data packets; so far, there is little perceived human 
suffering. 
None of these characteristics of cyberspace or cyber conflict fits easily into 
Sun Tzu‟s paradigm. As national security thinkers and military strategists 
begin to write concepts, strategies, and doctrine for cyber warfare with the Art 
of War model in mind, they should be aware of these differences.
