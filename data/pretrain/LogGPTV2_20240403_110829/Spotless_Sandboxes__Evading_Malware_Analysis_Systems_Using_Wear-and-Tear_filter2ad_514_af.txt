### Combining Raw Values to Estimate a System’s Actual Age

To estimate a system's actual age, we first process our dataset to remove artifacts with missing values. Specifically, for artifacts with a high rate of missing values (more than 80% of their values are missing), we exclude them from the dataset and do not attempt to utilize them further. For the remaining 37 artifacts, we use the rest of the dataset to predict the most appropriate value, as if we had been able to extract it. We employ a random-forest-based imputation technique, which is a standard method for handling missing values without removing entire observations or relying on overly generic statistics like the mean or mode, which could introduce bias.

### Linear Regression Model

We begin by using linear regression, a common and effective method in many contexts. The formula we use is:

\[ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + \ldots + \epsilon \]

where \( X_i \) represents the value of any given artifact, and we aim to calculate the weights \( \beta_i \) that will allow us to sum the artifacts in a way that provides a prediction of the machine's age (Y).

#### Training and Testing

To train the linear regression model, we split the user dataset into two sets: one for training (60%) and one for testing (40%). The test dataset is kept aside to evaluate how well the model generalizes to previously unseen data. The model is trained on the training set, and we use 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate its performance, resulting in a mean square error (MSE) of 1.23.

The coefficients of the model and their p-values are reported in Table VII. We find that 13 wear-and-tear artifacts correlate with a machine’s age in a statistically significant way. Although the model is not perfect, it can explain up to 68% of the variability in a system’s age.

#### Evaluation on Unseen Data

To ensure the model's accuracy, we evaluate it against the previously unseen test dataset. We apply the model to the unseen test dataset of systems belonging to real users to verify its predictive accuracy. We then use it to predict the age of sandboxes and compare it with their claimed age. The MSE of the predicted ages for regular systems is 1.88, while for sandboxes, it is 6.25. These results indicate that a model trained on real user data can not only predict the age of other unseen systems based on the values of their wear-and-tear artifacts but also identify when a system’s artifacts are unrealistically high (or low) for its claimed age.

### Residuals Analysis

Figure 7 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the residuals when applying our linear regression model to systems from the real dataset. This analysis helps us understand the distribution of the errors and the overall fit of the model.
