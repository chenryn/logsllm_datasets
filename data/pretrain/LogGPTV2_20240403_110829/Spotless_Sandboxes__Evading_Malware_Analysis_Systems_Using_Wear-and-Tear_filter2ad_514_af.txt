combining their raw values to estimate a system’s actual age.
To that end, we ﬁrst process our dataset to remove artifacts
with missing values in many of our observations. For artifacts
with a high rate of missing values (more than 80% of their
values are missing) we remove them from our dataset and do
not attempt to utilize them any further. For the remaining 37
artifacts, we used the rest of the dataset to predict what would
have been the most appropriate value, had we been able to
extract it. We use a random-forest-based imputation technique,
which is a standard way of handling missing values, without
the need to remove entire observations and without relying on
overly generic statistics, like a feature’s mean or mode, which
could bias our results.

1) Linear Regression: We ﬁrst attempt to use linear regres-
sion, since this is a common regression method that works
well in many contexts. In essence, we start with the formula
Y = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + ... +  where Xi is the value of
any given artifact, and try to calculate the weights βi that
would allow us to sum the artifacts in a way that will provide
a prediction of machine’s age (Y ).
To train a linear regression model based on the real users’
dataset, we ﬁrst split the user dataset into two sets, one
for training (60%) and one for testing (40%). We keep the
test dataset aside to use it later to test how well our model
generalizes on previously unseen data. Our linear regression
model is trained on the training set, and we use a 10-fold
cross validation to evaluate it, which results in a mean square
error (MSE) of 1.23. The coefﬁcients of the model and their
p-values are reported in Table VII. We see that 13 wear-and-
tear artifacts correlate with a machine’s age in a statistically
signiﬁcant way. Even though our model is not perfect, it can
still explain up to 68% of the variability in a system’s age.
Since the training error does not necessarily guarantee the
performance of our model when dealing with new data, we
evaluate the accuracy of the linear regression model against
the previously unseen test dataset. We ﬁrst apply our model to
the unseen test dataset of systems belonging to real users to
make sure that it can predict their age with sufﬁcient accuracy,
and then proceed to use it to predict the age of sandboxes and
compare it with their claimed age. The MSE of the predicted
ages for the regular systems is 1.88, while sandboxes have
a very high MSE of 6.25. Our results indicate that a model
trained on real user data can not only predict the age of other
unseen systems based on the values of their wear-and-tear
artifacts, but it can also identify that a system’s artifacts are
unrealistically high (or low) for its claimed age.
