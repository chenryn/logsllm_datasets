I want to be able to recompile only dependencies (rather than everything in a
crate), like SML's compilation manager or GHC's `--make` mode. I don't really
care about the approach so long as it works and the outcome is that adding one
`#debug` call in one file doesn't trigger recompilation of 100 other files in
the same crate :-) I am volunteering to work on this after 0.3, but
suggestions are welcome. Patrick suggested a good place to start would be to
generate a (visualizable) graph of item dependencies, which makes sense to me.
