User: When backing up Linux system data, how to use the rsync command to achieve incremental backup and avoid repeated transmission?
Assistant: To use the rsync command for incremental backups and avoid duplicate transfers, follow these steps: 1. Perform a full backup: First, to perform a full backup, use the following command: `rsync -avz /source/destination/` This command will back up all files and subdirectories in the `/source/` directory to the `destination/` directory. 2. Perform an incremental backup: After performing a full backup, the next backup will be an incremental backup. Use the following command to make an incremental backup: `rsync -avz --delete --link-dest=../previous_backup/ /source/destination/current/` This command will backup the changed files in the `/source/` directory to the `destination/current/` directory, and will create hard links to the corresponding files in the `../previous_backup/` directory. This means that only new, changed and deleted files are transferred, while previously backed up files do not need to be transferred since they already exist in `../previous_backup/` directory. 3. Automate backups: To automate backups, you can add the rsync command to a cron job to perform backups daily, weekly, or monthly.
