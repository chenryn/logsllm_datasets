User: I am using OpenCV in windows. When I am using this command in windows command prompt then I am getting an error as opencv_annotation is not recognised as the internal or external command.
opencv_annotation --annotations=/C:\Users\harsh\Desktop/annotation.txt --images=C:\Users\harsh\Desktop/pos/
Assistant: You need to build it using CMake.
