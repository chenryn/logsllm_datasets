### Jetpack

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `jetpack` utility is used to compact the Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) database. It is recommended to compact the WINS database when its size approaches 30 MB.

**Functionality:**
The `jetpack.exe` tool compacts the database by:
1. Copying the database information to a temporary database file.
2. Deleting the original database file (either WINS or DHCP).
3. Renaming the temporary database file to the original filename.

**Syntax:**
```
jetpack.exe <original_database_file> <temporary_database_file>
```

**Parameters:**
- **<original_database_file>**: Specifies the name of the original database file.
- **<temporary_database_file>**: Specifies the name of the temporary database file to be created by `jetpack.exe`. Note that this temporary file is removed once the compaction process is complete. Ensure that the temporary file name is unique and does not already exist.

- **/?:** Displays help at the command prompt.

**Notes:**
- The temporary file is automatically deleted after the compaction process is complete.
- Ensure that the temporary file name is unique and does not already exist for the command to work properly.

**Examples:**

**To compact the WINS database:**
1. Navigate to the WINS directory:
   ```cmd
   cd %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\WINS
   ```
2. Stop the WINS service:
   ```cmd
   NET STOP WINS
   ```
3. Run the `jetpack` command:
   ```cmd
   jetpack Wins.mdb Tmp.mdb
   ```
4. Start the WINS service:
   ```cmd
   NET START WINS
   ```

**To compact the DHCP database:**
1. Navigate to the DHCP directory:
   ```cmd
   cd %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\DHCP
   ```
2. Stop the DHCP server service:
   ```cmd
   NET STOP DHCPSERVER
   ```
3. Run the `jetpack` command:
   ```cmd
   jetpack Dhcp.mdb Tmp.mdb
   ```
4. Start the DHCP server service:
   ```cmd
   NET START DHCPSERVER
   ```

By following these steps, you can effectively compact the WINS or DHCP databases, ensuring optimal performance and space management.
