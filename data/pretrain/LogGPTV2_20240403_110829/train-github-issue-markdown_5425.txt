To enable HTTPS URLs to function correctly, it is necessary to implement `CONNECT` support for proxies.

When proxy support was initially added to Scrapy, `urllib` did not yet support the `CONNECT` method. However, this issue has since been resolved, as documented in the following Python bug report:  
http://bugs.python.org/issue1424152

Now, we need to add `CONNECT` support to Scrapy, which does not use `urllib`. For guidance on how to implement `CONNECT` support using Twisted, please refer to the following resource:
