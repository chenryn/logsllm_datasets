User: In the eventuality that Fabric exits cleanly or not, I need to execute a bunch of clean-up tasks (mostly delete temp files and folders).
How can I achieve this with Fabric?
Assistant: You could always use the new execute() and wrap that in a try/except or just look at the return codes from your run()s.
