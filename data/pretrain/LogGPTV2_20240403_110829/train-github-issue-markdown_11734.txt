I think this was just missed as part of the infix expansions, or is there a
reason these don't allow for their setindex variant? Looks like a parser
failure to me.
MWE:
    julia> a = [1]               
    1-element Vector{Int64}:     
     1                           
    julia> a[1] ⊽= 2             
    ERROR: syntax: unexpected "="
    Stacktrace:                  
     [1] top-level scope         
       @ none:1                  
    julia> a[1] ⊼= 2
