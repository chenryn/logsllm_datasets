Based on real-world measurements, we consider ﬁve dif-
ferent error models representing diﬀerent scenarios and mea-
surement environments, see Table 5. The ﬁrst scenario con-
siders high noise from our worst case measurements (Case 1).
On the other hand, the ﬁfth scenario includes the most sta-
ble position solutions that we measured (Case 5). The other
scenarios are intermediate steps between the two extremes
(Cases 2,3,4). Notably, the third scenario represents an error
model for which authentic and spooﬁng signals suﬀer from
the same extent of errors.
The simulation covers varying receiver distances given as
the radius r, which is step-wise increased from 0 m to 15 m
with a step size of 0.01 m. The amount of generated mea-
surements is 10,000,000 for each receiver position and each
simulation run. The standard deviation is modeled by Gaus-
sian distributions and we use correlations between generated
datasets.
As the ﬁrst measure of performance, we consider equal
error rates (EER), i. e.,
1 − pd
!= pfa.
(8)
In other words, our decision threshold λ is chosen in such
a way that the probability of a false alarm pfa is equal to
the probability of a missed detection pd. However, we notice
that spooﬁng and non-spooﬁng scenarios are not equally dis-
tributed. In most cases, the receivers operate with authen-
tic signals, whereas an actual attack is very unlikely. False
alarms are generally more likely to occur than false detec-
tions and thus need to be weighted more than missed detec-
tions. The usage of the EER gives us a worst case estimation
with a stronger focus on reliable detection; the receivers dis-
tances may be decreased further if we allow poorer detection
probabilities. At the same time, missed detections typically
incur a larger security risk than false detections. To ac-
count for these considerations, we later additionally report
results individually for the probabilities of false alarms pfa
and missed detection pd.
6.2 Simulation of the Countermeasure
We examine the detection performance of our detection
mechanism for m = 4 receivers. The results under consid-
eration of the noise scenarios from Table 5 are depicted in
Figure 9. The required receiver distances diﬀer substantially
for each of the simulated cases. For example, a radius of ap-
prox. 11 m is needed for an EER of 10−6 in the worst mea-
sured scenario (Case 1). An EER of 10−6 equals only one
triggered alarm on a sample size of 1,000,000 measurements
under normal operation, whereas only one instance of spoof-
ing remains undetected. For our best noise model the re-
quired radius is reduced to approx. 2 m (Case 5). The radii
for the other scenarios vary from approx. 6 m (Case 2), and
approx. 4 m (Case 3), to approx. 3.5 m (Case 4).

considering our proposed improvements (top left),
considering correlation (top right), lower standard
deviation under spooﬁng (bottom left), and the com-
bination of both (bottom right).
To integrate our results with theoretic prior work [26–28],
we take σ = 4 (assumed by Swaszek et al. [27]) as a starting
point to show the eﬀect of our measurement-based improve-
ments. Note that the oﬃcial performance standard [30] only
gives typical ranges for the standard deviation from σ ≈ 1
to σ ≈ 8. Figure 10 shows the performance improvements
as we introduce our assumptions. The top left curves are
generated with a standard deviation of σ = 4 and a corre-
lation of ρ = 0.5 between position changes for both normal
operation and spooﬁng. A more realistic assumption on the
standard deviation is introduced in the bottom left ﬁgure,
where we keep σlegit = 4 and change σspoof = 1 emulating
the reduced position shifts under spooﬁng. At the top right
corner, we introduce the eﬀect of higher correlation during a
spooﬁng attack by adjusting ρspoof = 0.9. The bottom right
ﬁgure combines both eﬀects, i. e., σlegit = 4, σspoof = 1,
ρlegit = 0.5, and ρspoof = 0.9.
In particular, the (red) dashed line in Figure 10 represents
the resulting false alarm rate as a function of the radius
by ﬁxing the detection probability to pd = 0.99. Without
considering reduced error characteristics under spooﬁng, we
obtain pfa = 10−5 for a radius of approx. 12.31 m. Using
our derived parameter set, the required radius is reduced to
approx. 3.63 m for the same false alarm rate. The resulting
square has edges of length approx. 5.13 m.

Summary of Results. We conclude that our proposed im-
provements reduce the required area for the countermeasure
from 200 m2 in [27] to approx. (5.13 m)2 ≈ 26.32 m2, which
is almost an order of magnitude smaller (square area). For
this comparison, we picked the same UERE values as in [27].
If we use the UERE we measured in our experiments instead,
the performance would be increased even further.
7. PROTOTYPE IMPLEMENTATION
To demonstrate the applicability of our proposed multi-
receiver spooﬁng detection mechanism, we developed a pro-
totype implementation. We deployed an experimental setup
with m = 4 receivers positioned in a square with edge length
d = 5.00 m, which is equivalent to a circle with r ≈ 3.54 m.
Two receivers are placed in close vicinity to a metal wall
introducing signal shielding and additional multipath com-
ponents. Figure 11 shows the measurement environment
(the metallic wall is close to the right hand side).
We tested this formation in two diﬀerent environments:
(i) We recorded measurements under authentic conditions,
see Figure 11. (ii) We targeted the same formation with an
indoor spooﬁng attack. Notably, we used the indoor setup to
prevent—in particular illegal—interference with surround-
ing devices. We captured data for spooﬁng and normal op-
eration for close to three hours. For this speciﬁc setup we
utilized the normalized majority voting approach for the re-
ceiver distance analysis. The threshold, which is represented
by the horizontal line, is an estimation that optimizes both
the detection and the false alarm probability.
Within the entire measurement period, we encountered no
false alarms while under spooﬁng our countermeasure de-
tected the spooﬁng attack reliably as depicted in Figure 12.
More than 80,000 GPS measurements were recorded during
the experiments. The normalized majority distance for the
authentic measurements is constantly above the threshold,
whereas in the spooﬁng case it is always below. If any of the
measurements cross the threshold line, either a false alarm or
a missed spooﬁng would occur. A sliding-window approach
could compensate single threshold under- or overcuts.
Summary. With our prototype implementation we have
demonstrated that the detection mechanism is applicable
to m = 4 receivers positioned in a square of edge length
d = 5.00 m or a circle with radius r ≈ 3.54 m. For the
duration of the experiment we encountered no false alarms
and no missed spooﬁng events.

tance for authentic GPS signals (top) and under
spooﬁng (bottom). The horizontal line represents

Outlook on Future Work. This investigation of multi-
receiver GPS spooﬁng detection leaves promising studies for
future work. Before the countermeasure is deployed on a
larger scale, more investigations regarding the stability of
GPS errors and their correlation for diﬀerent locations, en-
vironmental conditions, and time intervals are desirable. Re-
cently, Pesyna et al. [19] presented the potentiality of cen-
timeter positioning, which would greatly improve our detec-
tion performance. Our investigations provide an evaluation
framework that facilitates extended measurements and eval-
uations. We leave the evaluation of overlapping legitimate
and spooﬁng signals for future work.
8. MULTI-ANTENNA ATTACKER
We now discuss the multi-antenna attacker with respect to
our GPS spooﬁng countermeasure. To the best of our knowl-
edge, this type of attacker has only been proposed theoret-
ically [29]; practical realizations do not exist in the public
literature.
Implementing and realizing this multi-antenna
attacker is challenging as we will explain in the following.
Comprehensive results as well as extensive descriptions and
evaluations are beyond the scope of this paper.
The multi-antenna attacker utilizes (at least) four anten-
nas each sending out a diﬀerent satellite signal. These sig-
nals arrive at the receivers as individual signals with certain
attacker-chosen time oﬀsets. If chosen properly, the signals
can be resolved to a position that is determined by the ac-
tual satellite positions included in the ephemeris data and
the corresponding ToA. Per receiver, this is identical to what
a single-antenna attacker would achieve. However, if we po-
sition the antennas such that the ToA at an adjacent receiver
can be correctly resolved to a position that is a conﬁgurable
distance apart, we can realize a distance-preserving multi-
antenna attack.
Our test setup uses two receivers and four USRPs N210 [3]
each transmitting a GPS satellite signal realizing an attacker
with four antennas. The signal samples were generated using
the software project gps-sdr-sim [4] and are synchronized
using a control laptop. In order to spoof a single receiver, the
246
four USRPs are positioned equidistantly around the targeted
receiver. The correct ToA (as under normal operation) is
already considered during the signal generation. When we
extend the countermeasure to m = 2 receivers, we need
to rearrange the antennas such that the relative ToA for
both receivers corresponds to the actual relative ToA for
that speciﬁc time frame.
For instance, for a co-located receiver at a distance of
5 m the diﬀerences in the pseudoranges are in the range of
−5 m to +5 m. Consequently, the antennas need to be moved
based on the second receiver position and the emitted satel-
lite signal. Additionally, the setup needs to be adapted to
the current ephemeris data and spoofed GPS time since dif-
ferences in the pseudoranges change over time.
Implementation Challenges. Under normal operation,
GPS signals have roughly the same signal power. For the
single receiver with equidistant senders we achieved a GPS
lock by using four separated signal sources. However, when
we rearrange the antennas to simultaneously fulﬁll the ToA
at an adjacent receiver, the distances to the second receiver
now varies from 0.5 m to 7 m in contrast to 5 m to the ﬁrst
receiver. This results in substantially diﬀerent power levels
which leads to a very unstable lock. Unfortunately, for a
realistic attacker that is located, e. g., at a distance of about
100 m from the receivers, however, the diﬀerences in power
levels are getting less and less since the relative diﬀerences
shrink as well.
Our Countermeasure. For settings with m ≥ 4 receivers,
a multi-antenna attack (with the attacker trying to adjust
the ToAs) cannot preserve the relative distances of all re-
ceivers [29]. As a result, our proposed multi-receiver coun-
termeasure with four receivers is expected to be resilient
against multi-antenna attacks by design. With our limited
multi-antenna attacker implementation, we were only able
to spoof single receivers, and even our most basic counter-
measure with m = 2 is already complicating the attack sig-
niﬁcantly.
9. RELATED WORK
First experimental work on the topic of GPS spooﬁng was
published by Warner et al. [32, 33]. The authors demon-
strated that GPS spooﬁng attacks were feasible using a GPS
satellite simulator. They proposed countermeasures mostly
based on signal strength diﬀerences for spoofed signals.
A rich set of related work on GPS spooﬁng was published
by Humphreys et al. [7, 10, 13, 20, 21]. In [7], a spoofer was
constructed that would use legitimate GPS signals to obtain
correct GPS data, and then re-transmit this data with se-
lectively applied time oﬀsets, causing the victim’s receiver
to compute a wrong location. In [13], physical-layer signal
characteristics such as phase shifts between two antennas
were used to detect ongoing spooﬁng attacks. This counter-
measure required a custom two-antenna receiver setup.
In [24], Scott proposed changes to the GPS signals to in-
troduce data-level authentication based on a public-key in-
frastructure. Another authentication signal-based scheme
was proposed in [11]. In [20], the (encrypted) military GPS
signal was used to authenticate the civilian signal received
at the same time. In [10], a practical GPS spooﬁng attack
on a UAV was conducted.
Spooﬁng detection based on diﬀerent signal characteris-
tics (e. g., angle-of-arrival, signal power, etc.) was discussed
in [2,16,17]. In contrast to these detection schemes focusing
on physical-layer characteristics, we focus on the navigation
message information itself. In other words, instead of using
pseudoranges [23] we use the position solution for our coun-
termeasure, which is easy to obtain, process, and store on a
high abstraction level.
The multi-receiver countermeasure was analyzed theoret-
ically in [5, 26–28]. The authors of [5] derived performance
values for mutual distances of 20 m achieving a false rejection
rate of less than 0.1 and a false detection rate of 0.01 (loca-
tion noise σ = 5 m). Therefore, the countermeasure seems
hardly applicable to most moving vehicles, but instead only
suited toward large stationary installations. Swaszek et al.
theoretically investigated the countermeasure, using statisti-
cal models [26,28] extended by bias in the 2D noise distribu-
tion of the localization result [27]. For a four-receiver coun-
termeasure, they suggest that a square setup with 14 m edge
distance would achieve a false acceptance rate of ≈ 10−5 and
a detection rate of ≈ 0.99 (location noise σ = 4 m). Such a
formation would require an area of 200 m2.
Other recent works consider GPS spooﬁng attacks on the
time and phase synchronization in smart power grids [9,34].
In [34], the authors propose to use a set of modiﬁed static
GPS receivers with tight time synchronization to determine
the exact time of arrival of spoofed signals at each locations
with 1 ns precision. Based on that information, multilatera-
