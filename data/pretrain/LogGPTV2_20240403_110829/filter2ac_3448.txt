**Title: BotConf 2015 - A Moose Once Bit My Honeypot: The Story of an Embedded Linux Botnet**

In recent years, embedded Linux platforms, often referred to as "Internet of Things" (IoT) devices, have become increasingly targeted by malware authors. Most of these infections result in the compromised system becoming part of a botnet. While many such botnets are used for distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks or DNS hijacking, we had the opportunity to investigate a unique variant in the landscape of embedded Linux botnets.

Linux/Moose is a sophisticated botnet that targets Linux-based consumer routers. Its primary purpose is to facilitate fraud on social networking sites such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube. To achieve this, the malware is equipped with SOCKS and HTTP proxying capabilities, along with a generic packet sniffer and data exfiltration mechanism.

To expand its botnet, Linux/Moose employs multiple scanner threads that identify and infect new hosts. These scanners are aided by a command-and-control (C&C) server, which provides a binary specific to the victim's architecture. Additionally, the malware includes features to bypass firewalls and perform Network Address Translation (NAT) traversal, allowing the operator to access networks behind firewalls.
