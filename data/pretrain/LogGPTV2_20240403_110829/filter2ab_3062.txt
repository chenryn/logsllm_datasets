**ATT&CK ID:** T0814  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Denial of Service

Adversaries may employ Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks to disrupt the normal functionality of a target device. Common DoS attack methods include:

1. **Flooding the Target with Traffic:** Overwhelming the target device with a high volume of requests in a short period, causing it to become unresponsive.
2. **Sending Malformed Requests:** Transmitting requests that the target device is unable to process, leading to resource exhaustion or system crashes.

A successful DoS attack can temporarily render the target device unresponsive, often requiring a reboot to restore normal operation. During this state of disruption, the device may be unable to send or receive requests and may fail to perform its intended functions in response to other environmental events.
