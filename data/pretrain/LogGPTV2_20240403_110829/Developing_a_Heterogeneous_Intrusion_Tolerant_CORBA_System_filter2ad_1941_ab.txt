### Replication Domain and Fault Management

Values from a replication domain must be carefully managed to maintain the integrity of confidential communications. If an element within a replication domain is determined to be faulty, it must be removed from the domain. Currently, ITDOS does not replace faulty elements; it simply removes them from the system. The replacement mechanism remains to be implemented.

### Group Manager

The Group Manager in ITDOS is responsible for managing replication domain membership and virtual connection management. It consists of a replication domain of Group Manager processes, which are not CORBA servers. Instead, these processes function as part of the middleware transport layer rather than at the application level. These processes work together to regulate the formation and membership of replication domains, as well as the establishment of connections between clients and servers. Additionally, the Group Manager provides session keys (symmetric communication keys) used to protect communications.

### ITDOS Prototype and Platforms

The ITDOS prototype is built on the ACE ORB (TAO), an open-source CORBA ORB. The target platforms include Solaris and Linux.

### Threats and Security Guarantees

ITDOS is designed to protect against threats that cause observable deviations in expected server behavior. It relies on the underlying Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) multicast protocol to tolerate up to \( f \) simultaneous failures and uses a voting mechanism to detect and mask faulty values. Provided no more than \( f \) simultaneous failures occur, ITDOS guarantees service availability, integrity, and communications confidentiality. However, if a replicated server is compromised, it can provide keys to all traffic within the groups it belongs to until the keys are reissued. A malicious, undetected server can also leak server state to unauthorized recipients. While the BFT protocol provides some defense against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, ITDOS is not resilient against unrestricted DoS attacks.

### Assumptions

The ITDOS system operates under several key assumptions:
- The network does not partition such that more than \( f \) of the replicated servers become unreachable.
- Authentication and confidentiality mechanisms remain unbroken, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of ITDOS messages.
- There will not be more than \( f \) simultaneous faults in a replication domain, where the number of servers in the group is greater than \( 3f + 1 \).
- The deployment environment is not susceptible to common-mode failures and supports language and implementation diversity.
- Correct processes will eventually deliver a message.
- Correct servers exhibit deterministic behavior.
- Authentication tokens for each process are adequately protected and only available to authorized users.
- Additional assumptions are driven by the Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol.

### Architectural Features

#### Secure Reliable Multicast

ITDOS integrates an existing BFT multicast protocol, specifically the Castro-Liskov protocol, which uses a state-transfer approach coupled with a request/response mechanism. This protocol ensures that replicas are kept in sync and allows for efficient handling of nested invocations. ITDOS modifies the Castro-Liskov protocol minimally to add virtual synchrony, ensuring that replicas that do not participate correctly are expelled to make progress.

#### Connection Management

CORBA's General Inter-ORB Protocol (GIOP) requires connection semantics to integrate the Castro-Liskov transport into the ORB architecture. ITDOS creates virtual connections over the Castro-Liskov transport layer, and the Group Manager manages these connections in an intrusion-tolerant manner. The Group Manager itself is an ITDOS replication domain, providing high availability and integrity.

To support nested invocations, ITDOS executes the Castro-Liskov transport as a message delivery system running in one thread of the CORBA server process. All messages sent to the replication domain are delivered through this thread to the ORB thread. The reply expected at the Castro-Liskov layer acts as an acknowledgment message, while the CORBA reply is sent to the client through the Castro-Liskov transport, making it essentially unidirectional. Each replication domain element has two threads: one for ORB execution and one for Castro-Liskov message delivery.

#### Group Membership and Performance

The size of the ordering group directly impacts performance and scalability. Total-ordering protocols are resource-intensive, and the number of messages exchanged increases with the number of members in the ordering group. To minimize performance penalties, ITDOS restricts the ordering group to the replication domain, excluding clients from the message ordering process. This approach limits the size of the ordering group and enhances overall system performance.
