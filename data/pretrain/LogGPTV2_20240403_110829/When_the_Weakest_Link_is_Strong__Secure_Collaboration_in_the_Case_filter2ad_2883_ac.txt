tial users while at the same time putting secu-
rity of our work a priority. (J109)
Not been an expert, I believe the ICIJ team has
done a fantastic work on security. (J111)
As we will discuss further in Section 5, this trust
placed by contributors in the ICIJ team likely contributed
to that team’s ability to mandate security requirements.
4.2 Results from Interviews
We now turn to a discussion of our interview results, ac-
cording to the topics from the interview script. Where
relevant, we include verbatim quotes from participants
to illustrate our ﬁndings. We identify quotes using only a
letter (IT for technical staff, E for editorial staff, includ-
ing the journalist who originally received the Panama Pa-
pers documents) and participant number.
4.2.1 Security Goals and Threat Model
Because the documents at the center of the Panama Pa-
pers project related largely to tax evasion, government
actors—who could expect to recoup lost revenue through
their exposure—were explicitly not considered to be part
of the threat model for the project. That said, the compa-
nies, criminals (such as tax evaders, money-launderers
and drug-trafﬁckers), and politicians who were impli-
cated in the documents were all identiﬁed as actors who
could potentially conﬁscate locally-held data as well as
threaten, imprison ,or even kill the journalists involved
and/or block publication or access to the work. Given
the size and resources of ICIJ, the primary security goals
prior to publication therefore centered on protecting the
source of the documents, maintaining the secrecy of the
project, and maintaining the availability of the Black-
light, I-Hub, and Linkurious systems.
While our research participants only explicitly men-
tioned DDoS attacks and inadvertent project expo-
sure as risks,
training documents provided by par-
ticipants indicate a range of security concerns, such
as: spyware/malware, network monitoring, weak pass-
words/password reuse, physical interception of data (via
locally-stored, unencrypted data or printouts) and legal
attacks via third-parties. For example, a training docu-
ment explicitly warned contributors against using third-
party applications to translate, OCR or visualize the
Panama Papers data, and encouraged storing local data
from the project only in encrypted, hidden volumes.
These concerns informed the system design in myr-
iad ways. First, both the sheer volume of the data–and
the goal of protecting its source–led in part to the de-
cision to use a centralized, remotely-accessible method
of sharing the documents, rather than providing contrib-
utors with individual hard drives, as ICIJ had done in
previous projects. As one ICIJ staffer put it:
This is sensitive data that has been leaked to
ICIJ for a reason, and that those sources are
trusting us with being. . . guardians of that in-
formation and protectors. So it’s not for us to
give away to anybody, not even a trusted col-
league. (E2)
Instead, the centralized system allowed ICIJ to grant
all journalist contributors access to the documents, while
still allowing ICIJ to monitor–and restrict–the volume of
data that they could download from the system.
Second, the lack of a nation-state adversary–in con-
junction with the speciﬁcs of Amazon Cloud’s contrac-
tual agreements–made cloud-hosting an option. It was
also a technical requirement, due to the volume of data
involved and the need for substantial pre-processing.
4.3 System Design
Informing and interacting with ICIJ’s security goals for
the project were the organization’s driving journalistic
objectives: supporting high-quality, high-impact report-
ing and publications. Due to the enormous volume of
data and documents involved (2.6 TB consisting of about
11.5 million documents), as well as their global na-
ture, remote search and collaboration were essential—
priorities that were clearly shared by both the editorial
and technical staff:
The needs are... communicate, and search doc-
uments, and to do it collaboratively. (E3)
One of the more important impacts was that
journalists discovered how convenient, power-
ful and good it is to collaborate. . . I think that
the I-Hub contributed to this:
to teach them
how to interact, and it is a really good thing to
share knowledge, share documents, share data,
and build these networks. (IT2)
One reason the multi-national collaboration was es-
sential was the variety of formats and languages within
the source material, especially since participants were
warned–through training, tip-sheets, and regular messag-
ing from project leaders–against using third-party tools
like Google Translate due to security concerns.
ICIJ’s

tools were therefore crucial to effective collaboration
across timezone and language barriers:
With cultural barriers, with language barriers
and with time zones and all that... I think it was
just the speed and the friendliness...
it made
11 million documents look easy, look doable,
and look—because it was easy and friendly to
use, it became addictive to the reporters doing
searches... and I like that. (E2)
Indeed, explicitly cultivating collaboration was a key
design goal of I-Hub in particular, and it seemed to work:
You cannot collaborate on email, or encrypted
email, or Signal. You need a real space that
feels comfortable and friendly and it’s colorful,
and [I-Hub] was. (E2)
The forum was never as used and crowded as
this time... It felt like everybody was sharing
[and] working very collaboratively. (E1)
One reason that I-Hub may have been so easily
adopted was its explicit similarity to familiar technolo-
gies (see also Figure 2):
You can upload ﬁles, you can “like” a topic.
You know, which is something that we’re all
so used to in the Facebook world. But that
simple kind of “liking” thing also helped re-
porters bond together and encourage one an-
other. And they were not going crazy with the
likes, you know, most of the time people were
not “liking” things, they were actually con-
tributing useful information. But sometimes,
you know, when somebody has made an im-
portant discovery...it just helped tremendously
with providing a sense of team. (E2)
As we discuss further in Section 5, the fact that the
ICIJ explicitly cultivated and supported such a collabo-
rative culture—and that this collaboration was core to the
success of the project itself—helped lay the groundwork
for users’ acceptance of strong security requirements.
4.3.1 Selecting Journalist Collaborators
In line with prior research on investigative journalists
(e.g., [46]), our survey results indicate that the major-
ity of the journalist contributors to the Panama Papers
project were not security experts. Since any member of
the collaboration is a potential “weakest link”, we exam-
ine how these collaborators were chosen.
While ICIJ explicitly sought project contributors
based in as wide a range of countries as possible, the core
group of journalists (which numbered approximately 100
as of September 2015 and grew to nearly 400 by project
launch in April 2016) were all existing ICIJ members.
Interestingly, members who brought in non-member col-
leagues were considered responsible for disseminating
and enforcing security protocols set by ICIJ:
We would reach out to our member and trusted
person...
then the trusted journalist talks to a
very small group of people in his own media
organization... And then, if they get assigned
to do the story, then we would train them, we
would give them access to platforms... It’s up
to the trusted member and reporter to enforce
all the rules and regulations with any person
that that reporter bring on board. (E2)
Our interviews suggest that explicitly leveraging trust
relationships within an established social network helped
maintain the project’s security requirements even as new
members joined. While in practice this resembles a “web
of trust” model, we note that unlike some traditional
web-based implementations, each human “link” in this
chain had a strong-tie connection to their closest link.
4.3.2 System Security
We now turn to a discussion of the security decisions
made in the design and maintenance of ICIJ’s systems,
based on our interviews.
Technical Security. Key security aspects of all systems
includes careful vetting of the source documents (includ-
ing scanning them for known malware), deploying well-
tested HTTPS, and requiring two-factor authentication
for each of the three core systems.
The team experimented with multiple versions of two-
factor authentication, including virtual machines (dis-
carded as too complex) and browser extensions (dis-
carded as insufﬁciently secure). Eventually, they settled
on a smartphone-based app solution, which proved scal-
able despite initial concerns:
You have to have a smartphone. And, we
had a little discussion about, “Is this going to
work?” Because Africa is big on cell phones,
but mostly they’re not smartphones... And
then, when we started adding partners to the
Panama Papers, everybody pretty much ended
up having a smartphone. (E3)
Secure Defaults. One striking security decision was
making PGP-encrypted email the default communication
method for essential system functions. By summer 2016,
participants were required provide a PGP key in order to
obtain system credentials (including reset/recovery). To-
day, all notiﬁcation emails from those systems are also
encrypted by default.
Initially, however, contributors could receive pass-
word rest information via HushMail HushMail, and un-
encrypted system notiﬁcations still included details like

USENIX Association
the summary of an updated thread. As security concerns
increased post-launch, however, all details were elim-
inated from notiﬁcations until default PGP encryption
could be implemented. Yet we note that the security cul-
ture among these journalists was strong enough by this
point that they were willing to tolerate several months of
reduced functionality for security purposes.
Achieving these secure defaults, however, was not the
result of voluntary collective action: at some point, ICIJ
mandated that all contributors create and use a PGP key:
It was not a choice... If somebody did not get
themselves a PGP, he did not get access to the
forum and to the I-Hub. (E1)
A helpful side-effect of this requirement, however,
was that it became possible for PGP-encrypted email to
become a default for communication even beyond the I-
Hub—and it was, even for seemingly non-sensitive ma-
terial. As one core editorial afﬁliate put it:
We had a rule in our team that whatever is
about the Panama Papers—and if it’s only
about, I don’t know, “Let’s meet at nine,
okay?” then we encrypt it because we encrypt
everything that has to do with the Panama Pa-
pers. So that was our rule... the automatic step
was to encrypt. (E1)
By creating secure defaults—especially ones that were
useful outside of the project’s infrastructure—the secu-
rity achieved within the Panama Papers project systems
also enhanced journalists’ level of security beyond them.
Human Support and Communication with Users.
Both technical and editorial staff emphasized the incre-
mental was in which security features were rolled out.
Moreover, they highlighted that security mandates from
ICIJ were counterbalanced by increasing user investment
in the systems, supported in part by open feedback chan-
nels and the addition of user-requested features:
I said, “If you have any suggestions or any
questions regarding the platforms, email me.”
(E3)
We also encouraged the community to tell us
through the Global I-Hub. There was a group
called “data geeks” or something like that, and
we encouraged them to tell us where we could
improve. (E3)
ICIJ also provided accessible (human) technical sup-
port:
We also have a support channel... So we’re
always assisting them all the time with their
technological needs... Some of them forgot to
change their phones... [and] didn’t know how
to re-install or how to reconnect with a new au-
thenticator. (E2)
The result was a pace of security upgrades that
matched users’ investment in and need for the systems:
So we have people to teach them how to [set
up their PGP key], we have a support team
that can help them. . . It went well because they
were interested in keeping the access to the
[platform]. (IT2)
In addition, these open lines of communication led to
broad-based improvements in the platforms’ function-
ality. For example, the user-suggested functionality of
“batch search” was mentioned by four out ﬁve interview
participants as one of the most valuable features of the
Blacklight system:
I was very glad that we could do batch searches
in the end, which is a huge help. (E1)
Security Disagreements. Of course, security-related
disagreements did arise. As security concerns increased
post-launch, for example, reliance on the more usable
Hushmail was scrapped in favor of PGP:
It’s much easier to create a Hushmail account.
It’s like creating a Google account. You know,
like it takes that long [snaps ﬁnger]. Like noth-
ing. I think that they say it’s an encrypted sys-
tem end-to-end and other things, but the reality
is also that you don’t know. (E2)
At one point, I approached my managers and I
said, look, everyone has serious doubts about
HushMail... we just need to change our policy.
(IT1)
ICIJ technologists also considered using CryptDB [3,
49], to encrypt the source documents while keeping them
searchable. Yet while both primary technologists agreed
that CryptDB was not a good ﬁt, their reasoning around
this decision was different. While one participant cited
a mismatch in threat model, another had concerns about
CryptDB’s maturity:
I don’t think that there is any beneﬁt in en-
crypting data at rest. We had this discussion
early on in the project. One of the propos-
als was to use an encrypted version of MySQL
[CryptDB]... the passwords have to be stored
on the servers themselves... So what’s the
point? (IT1)
We tried to use CryptDB, which is an en-
crypted database, but it was a new project and
it didn’t work... because the project was not
stable enough. (IT2)
4.3.3 Security Weaknesses
Incidents. Our interviewees knew of no system breaches
that took place during the course of the Panama Papers
USENIX Association
26th USENIX Security Symposium    513
project. Prior to launch, there was only one occasion
when system monitoring suggested a possible attack:
We had to ask one of our partners to bring
his computer because we were detecting some
weird requests to our systems. (IT2)
Once the partner in question changed machines, the
requests stopped, though the underlying cause was never
determined (the device was reviewed by the partner’s or-
ganization, but no report was made to ICIJ).
Two security incidents occurred post-launch, both
centering on the exposure of the systems’ URLs, which
had been intentionally kept secret. Due in part to the cost
of more robust DDoS protection, project leads opted to
maintain endpoint secrecy:
If someone gets the location of the servers,
they can do several attacks... We are pre-
pared for this, for brute force [authentication]
attacks... But yeah they also can send a DDoS
