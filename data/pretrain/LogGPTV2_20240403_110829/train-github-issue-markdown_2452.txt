It appears that there is an inconsistency in the output between the `map` and `pmap` functions. Specifically, while `map` preserves the shape of the input, `pmap` does not. It would be beneficial for `pmap` to also maintain the shape of the input.

Here is a demonstration of the current behavior:

```julia
julia> map(prod, Base.product(1:5, 1:5))
5Ã—5 Matrix{Int64}:
 1   2   3   4   5
 2   4   6   8  10
 3   6   9  12  15
 4   8  12  16  20
 5  10  15  20  25

julia> pmap(prod, Base.product(1:5, 1:5))
25-element Vector{Any}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 2
 4
 6
 8
 10
 3
 6
 9
 12
 15
 4
 8
 12
 16
 20
 5
 10
 15
 20
 25
```

As you can see, `map` returns a 5x5 matrix, whereas `pmap` returns a 25-element vector. Ideally, `pmap` should also return a 5x5 matrix to ensure consistency with `map`.
