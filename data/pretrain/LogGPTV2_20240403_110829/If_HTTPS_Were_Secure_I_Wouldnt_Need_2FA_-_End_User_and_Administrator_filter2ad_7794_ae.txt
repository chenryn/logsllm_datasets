frequently contained protocol components and technical terms
without accompanying understanding of their functionality
and purpose within the protocol conﬁguration. Among other
insights, our ﬁndings suggest
that 1) many users confuse
encryption with authentication, 2) end users assume the om-
nipotence of attackers and signiﬁcantly underestimate the
security beneﬁts of HTTPS, and 3) many users of both types
generally ignore or even distrust security indicators.
Our work reveals reasons for the usability challenges deter-
mined by Krombholz et al. [4] that are often responsible for
vulnerable HTTPS conﬁgurations. Our results, furthermore,
explain why users often fail to correctly assess the implications
of clicking through warnings. And, ﬁnally, we provide founda-
tions for future designs of cryptographic protocols that are eas-
ier for administrators and developers to deploy or implement
related code in the most secure manner and therefore minimize
the exposure of end users to security-critical decisions when
communicating online.
As future work, it remains to show how our ﬁndings can be
used to inform the design of future cryptographic protocols.
We think that our results can inform a larger (quantitative)
study which could make use of closed-ended questions. Such
future work could also include questions on administrator
qualiﬁcations and knowledge questions to measure large-scale
effects and to perform multivariate analyses.
