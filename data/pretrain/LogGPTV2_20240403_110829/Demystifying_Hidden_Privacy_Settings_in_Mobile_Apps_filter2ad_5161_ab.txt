### User Study 2: Identifying Hidden Privacy Settings

In this study, we aimed to identify and evaluate the accessibility of 600 privacy settings across 200 different mobile applications. Participants were asked to locate these settings and provide feedback on their experience.

#### Participant Recruitment and Testing Environment
- **English Apps**: We recruited 405 participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) between October 23, 2017, and January 18, 2018. These participants tested the apps using an online mobile simulator, Appetize.io, which closely mimics the experience of using a real smartphone.
- **Chinese Apps**: For Chinese applications, we recruited participants from university campuses for in-lab testing, as few MTurkers are proficient in Chinese. The in-lab testing took place from June 10, 2017, to July 24, 2017, with participants using real mobile devices. To ensure familiarity with smartphones, participants were required to have at least one year of experience with such devices.

#### Task and Compensation
- Each participant was asked to find five privacy settings from five different apps in a single questionnaire.
- Participants were compensated $2 for completing the task on MTurk and 5 Chinese Yuan for in-lab testing.

#### Example Task
For instance, participants were instructed to find the setting that allows users to share their location in a dating app like "YouLove," which has over five million downloads on Google Play. They were asked to rate the difficulty of locating the setting on a scale from "very easy" to "very difficult." If they found the task challenging, they were prompted to explain why.

#### Data Collection and Validation
- We collected 338 completed responses from 405 MTurk participants. Those who did not complete the task cited its complexity as the main reason.
- We removed 38 responses from MTurk and 27 from in-lab tests due to illogical or careless answers, such as responding "Yes" to a "Why" question.
- In total, we gathered 300 valid responses from MTurk and 300 from in-lab participants, resulting in 600 valid responses.
- The demographic breakdown of participants was 64.66% male and 35.34% female, with 77.12% holding a Bachelor's degree or higher.

#### Quantifying Difficulty
To quantify the difficulty of finding privacy settings, we assigned numeric values to the difficulty levels:
- "Very Easy" = 1
- "Easy" = 2
- "Moderate" = 3
- "Difficult" = 4
- "Very Difficult" = 5
- If a participant could not find the setting, it was assigned a value of 5.

The average score for each setting was calculated. A setting was considered hidden if its average score was above 3. Our analysis revealed that nearly half (47.12%) of the 600 privacy settings were hidden: 50.50% in English apps and 44.33% in Chinese apps. Among the hidden settings, 9.64% were not found by any participant, and 42.83% were missed by at least one participant.

#### Reliability of Ratings
We calculated Fleiss’s kappa for each setting across all five participants. The average kappa was 71.93% (69.77% for English and 74.08% for Chinese), indicating a high level of agreement among participants regarding the difficulty of finding privacy settings.

### Root Causes for Hidden Privacy Settings

Participants provided 1,800 pieces of feedback, which helped us identify the following six main causes for hidden privacy settings:

| Cause | Feedback (%) |
|-------|--------------|
| Uncommon UI-path | 27.89% |
| Uncommon Indicator | 8.50% |
| Insufficient Text Descriptions | 17.17% |
| Long UI-path | 8.11% |
| Too Many UI Elements | 17.50% |
| Lengthy Text Descriptions | 19.50% |

These causes are related to the user interface (UI) path, which is the sequence of views leading from the app's home screen to the privacy setting. The last view containing the setting is called the key view. For example, in Figure 2, the UI-path is Home View → Profile → Settings.

### Design and Implementation of Hound

To understand the privacy implications of hidden settings, we developed an automatic tool called Hound. Hound consists of two components: the Privacy Setting Discoverer (PSD) and the Hidden Privacy Setting Identifier (HPSI).

#### PSD: Privacy Setting Discoverer
- **Function**: Extracts all settings from an app and filters out those unrelated to privacy.
- **Process**: 
  - Static analysis of the app's UI layout files (in XML) to find all settings.
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP) to determine if a setting is privacy-related.
  - Feature vector creation using tf-idf (term frequency-inverse document frequency) for each setting description.

#### HPSI: Hidden Privacy Setting Identifier
- **Function**: Detects hidden privacy settings based on user feedback.
- **Process**:
  - Uses 14 features derived from the six main causes of hidden settings.
  - Trains a classifier to predict whether a setting is hidden.

By leveraging Hound, we can systematically identify and address hidden privacy settings, enhancing the overall usability and privacy of mobile applications.
