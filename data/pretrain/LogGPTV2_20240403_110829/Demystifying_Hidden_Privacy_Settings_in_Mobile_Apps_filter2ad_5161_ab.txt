representing almost all of their opinions about what made a
privacy setting difﬁcult to ﬁnd.
User study 2: Identify hidden privacy settings. In this survey,
we asked the participants to locate the 600 given privacy settings
from the 200 apps and describe their experience in ﬁnding these
settings. For the English apps, we recruited 405 participants
from MTurk during Oct. 23th, 2017 and Jan. 18th, 2018. We
installed them on an online mobile simulator Appetize.io [7]
and gave the URL links to the participants for testing5. For the
Chinese apps, we recruited Chinese participants from university
279.62% if the careless responses are included.
356.23% if the careless responses are included.
463.94% if the careless responses are included.
5The mobile simulator is commonly used for testing mobile apps. The
operation experience is very similar to that on real smartphones.

campuses for in-lab testing, mainly due to the fact that very few
Turkers know Chinese. This study started on Jun. 10th, 2017
and ended on Jul. 24th, 2017, in which real mobile devices
were given to the participates for doing their tasks. To minimize
the bias introduced when one is unfamiliar with mobile devices,
we required the participants to have at least one-year experience
with the smartphone. In the experiment, each participant was
asked to ﬁnd ﬁve privacy settings from ﬁve apps in one
questionnaire and was compensated with two dollars for Turkers
and ﬁve Chinese Yuan for those attending the in-lab testing.
Use the dating app YouLove as an example, which has more
than ﬁve million downloads on Google Play. The participants
were told “Some social apps, such as ‘YouLove’, often provide
settings for users to set whether to share location”. Then we
asked them to ﬁnd the setting and comment on the difﬁculty in
locating the setting (“very easy”, “easy”, “moderate”, “difﬁcult”
and “very difﬁcult”). If the participant considered the task to
be hard, we further asked her why she thought so. Note that,
to avoid unnatural user behaviors induced by the wording in
the survey, our questions do not include the terms like “privacy
setting” and other privacy-related wordings (which may cause
users to focus more on privacy-related settings). The survey
link is given in Appendix X-A.
In the end, we collected 338 completed responses from 405
participants on MTurk. Those who failed to ﬁnish the responses
were mainly discouraged by the complexity of the task. Further,
we removed 38 responses on MTurk and 27 responses from the
in-lab test by checking whether the answers to the open-ended
questions [8] make sense (e.g., They answer “Yes” to a “Why”
question). In the study, 300 valid responses from MTurk (out
of 338) and 300 valid responses from the in-lab participants
(out of 327, with 5 valid responses for each questionnaire)
were gathered before the survey collection stopped. Among
all the participants, 64.66% are male and 35.34% are female,
with 77.12% holding a Bachelor or higher degree.
To quantify the difﬁculty in locating a privacy setting, we
score the responses we received. We ﬁrst assign each difﬁculty
level (“very easy”, “easy”, “moderate”, “difﬁcult” or “very
difﬁcult”) a numeric value, with 1 being the lowest and 5
the highest. When a participant did not ﬁnd the given privacy
setting, we gave the setting a 5. Then for each privacy setting,
we calculated its average score. If the value is above 3, we
view it as a hidden setting. Among the 600 privacy settings,
we ﬁnd that nearly half of them (47.12%) are hidden: 50.50%
of them are in English apps, and 44.33% are in Chinese apps.
Among the hidden privacy settings, 9.64% have not been found
by anyone; 42.83% of them have been missed by at least one
participant. In our study, we calculated the Fleiss’s kappa [9]
for every setting across all 5 participants, and the average result
is 71.93% (69.77% in English and 74.08% in Chinese), which
indicates that these participants’ ratings of difﬁculty levels for
the settings are in reliable agreement.
Root causes for hidden privacy settings. Also we asked the
participants to report why a setting is difﬁcult to ﬁnd. From the
survey, we get 1,800 feedback on privacy settings, which shed
light on the problem from the user’s perspective. For example,
116 participants (reporting 502 feedback) complain that some
apps do not put some privacy settings in their usual locations
as other apps do: e.g.,“I don’t see it anywhere. I go to privacy
setting. It’s not anywhere to be found. You seriously have it
there?”. 89 participants (reporting 351 feedback) mention that
it is hard for them to locate a privacy setting from a long list
of different conﬁgurations: e.g., “Too many items and texts
in one screen annoys me. I don’t want to read them one by
one.” These feedback are analyzed in our research to identify
six main causes, as shown in Table II, which cover 98.67%
of all the feedback. The rest 1.33% are less common, such
as “The fonts are too small.” that is reported by only one
participant. The percentage of each root cause summarized
from the feedback is shown in Table II.
These six causes are all related to UI-path, a sequence of
views that link an app’s home view (i.e., initial activity) to

a given privacy setting. When the user clicks on a certain
UI element on a view to move the UI to the next one, these
two views are connected (with direction) on the UI-path. The
last view containing the privacy setting is referred to as the
key view. For example, in Figure 2, the left screenshot is the
home view, and the right one is the key view hosting the
privacy setting “PHONE CONTACT VISIBILITY (Allow to be
found from phone number)”. The UI-path is home view →
P rof ile → Settings. Here the UI elements trigger the UI
transition are called indicators (e.g., “Proﬁle” and “Settings”
in the ﬁrst two UIs in Figure 2).
Coming back to the causes for the observed user confu-
sion, the ﬁrst three are related to user habits. Most users
tend to follow the UI-path: home view → Settings →
P rivacy Settings. For the settings that cannot be found
through this path, they could get lost (Cause 1). For example,
we ﬁnd a privacy conﬁguration on the view titled Messages,
which is very hard for the user to locate. Further the UI
items that lead the user down the path are often characterized
by certain text descriptions and icons. Once these indicators
cannot be identiﬁed from such familiar signs, the user can have
trouble in ﬁnding the related settings (Cause 2). For example,
Privacy Shortcuts rather than Privacy Settings is found to make
it harder for the user to get to the settings. As another example,
we observe that the participants were confused when Settings
and Proﬁle are not represented by their typical icons (gear and
portrait as illustrated in Figure 3). Another cause of confusion
is the lack of text descriptions. We discover that participants
can get lost in the presence of the indicators that do not have
text and represented with unusual icons (Cause 3).
Also causing the problem is the user’s patience. From the
participants’ feedback, in the presence of a long UI-path
(Cause 4) or a view with too many UI elements (Cause
5), the user becomes less likely to ﬁnd a privacy setting. For
example, a “difﬁcult” setting reported in our study is hidden
behind a UI-path with 5 views, which can only be reached
after the user clicks on 4 indicators, as shown in Figure 13 at
Appendix X-B. We even found a view carrying 47 elements.
Its privacy settings cannot be fully identiﬁed by all participants
in our study. Also interesting is that when a setting’s text
description is too long (see Figure 4), most people simply
ignore the setting (Cause 6).
III. DISCOVER HIDDEN PRIVACY SETTINGS
To understand the privacy implications of hidden settings,
we develop an automatic tool called Hound and utilize it
to perform a large-scale study on the usability of mobile
apps’ privacy conﬁgurations. Here we elaborate the design
and implementation of the tool.
A. Design Overview
The high-level design of Hound is illustrated in Figure 5,
which includes two components: Privacy Setting Discoverer
(PSD) and Hidden Privacy Setting Identiﬁer (HPSI). PSD runs
Natural Language Processing (NLP) on the descriptions of an
app’s settings to identify those related to privacy. Then from
those settings, HPSI further utilizes a classiﬁer, built on top of
the features discovered from our user study (see Section II-B),
to ﬁnd those considered to be hidden.
PSD. PSD is designed to extract all the settings from a given
app, and then ﬁlter out those unrelated to user privacy based
on its analysis of their text descriptions. More speciﬁcally,
its setting extractor statically analyzes the app’s UI layout
ﬁles after disassembling it to ﬁnd all its settings. The layout
ﬁles are in XML whose vocabulary [10] describes different UI
widgets. For example, the setting option widgets are usually
represented by  [11],  [12]
or  [13]. Moreover, the text descriptions
for the settings are in the widgets’ android : text attributes
or in those of other widgets nearby. Through checking widget
types and their text description, all the settings can be statically
discovered from the layout ﬁles6.
For each setting discovered, PSD uses NLP to determine
whether it is privacy-related. For this purpose, it ﬁrst runs
vectorizer to build a vocabulary with all 1-gram and 2-gram
terms in the description of each setting. Then it inspects the
description and transform it into a numeric feature vector based
on tf-idf (frequency-inverse document frequency), a standard
term-weighting scheme that measures the importance of a
word in the document. In this way, we can model each setting
description with a high-dimensional (the size of the vocabulary)
feature vector. The feature vector is then used by the privacy
classiﬁer to determine whether the setting is privacy-related.
The implementation of the PSD component is elaborated in
Section III-D.
HPSI. Most challenging here is how to detect hidden privacy
settings, those considered to be hard to ﬁnd by the ordinary user,
which has never been done before. To address this challenge,
HPSI leverages the feedbacks obtained from our user study
(Section II-B) to train a classiﬁer for predicting whether a
setting has the usability issue. More speciﬁcally, for each
privacy setting reported by PSD, HPSI extracts from it a set of
features and decides whether it is hidden by running a classiﬁer
(hiddenness classiﬁer) on the features.
Altogether, 14 features are used to characterize the hidden
settings, which are numeric values assigned based upon the
aforementioned six causes summarized over 1,800 feedbacks
6Some apps dynamically generate widgets and draw them in a view, which
is out of the scope of this paper. To capture them, one could analyze the code
for creating widgets in the apps.
