User:  How to protect the security of Web applications? What are some common web security vulnerabilities?
Assistant: Protecting the security of web applications needs to start from many aspects, the following are several key aspects: 1. Input verification: in the input phase of web applications, the data input by the user is verified, and the format, type and length of the input data are judged Whether it is legal, preventing front-end injection attacks, etc. 2. Identity authentication: To ensure that users can only access sensitive information or operate sensitive functions of the application after successfully passing the authentication, common authentication methods such as single sign-on (SSO) can be used. 3. Access control: Assign different access control permissions according to user roles to prevent users from unauthorized access to application data. At the same time, it is also necessary to strictly control the access permissions of applications and databases. 4. Data encryption: Encrypt the sensitive data in the application so that unauthorized personnel cannot read, modify, copy and delete the data. Common web security vulnerabilities include: 1. Cross-site scripting attack (XSS): An attacker submits malicious script code to a web application, causing the code to be executed on the victim's browser, thereby obtaining the victim's sensitive information. 2. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF): The attacker submits a request by constructing a malicious link or forging a form in order to use the victim's identity to complete illegal operations on the website. 3. SQL injection attack: The attacker injects malicious SQL code, causing the application to mistakenly execute the injected SQL code as a normal SQL command, resulting in the database being controlled by the attacker. 4. File inclusion vulnerability: Since the web application does not check or verify user input when processing files, attackers can control known file content by submitting malicious file inclusion paths, resulting in abnormal application functions and information leakage And other issues.
