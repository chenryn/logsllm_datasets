User: In Linux, how to check the status of each process on the server, and how to terminate abnormal processes?
Assistant: 1. Check process status In Linux, you can use the following commands to check the status of each process on the server: - ps command (Process Status): used to display the information about the currently running process. Syntax: `ps [options]` Common options: - `aux`: Display detailed information of all processes including other users; - `u`: Display information such as the user and start time of the process; - `f`: By tree structure Display process information; - `e`: Display all process information. - top command: display system resource usage and process information in real time, and sort by indicators such as CPU and memory. Syntax: `top` - htop command: the function is similar to top, but the interface is more beautiful and the operation is more convenient. Syntax: `htop` - pstree command: Display the parent-child relationship between processes in a tree structure. Syntax: `pstree` 2. Terminate the abnormal process If you need to terminate the abnormal process, you can use the following commands: - kill command: used to send a signal to the specified process, usually used to terminate the process. Syntax: `kill [options] PID` Common options: - `-9`: forcefully kill the process; - `-15`: send a SIGTERM signal to terminate the process. - pkill command: used to find the corresponding process according to the process name or other conditions, and send a signal to it to terminate the process. Syntax: `pkill [options] process_name` Common options: - `-9`: Forcefully kill the process; - `-15`: Send SIGTERM signal to terminate the process. Note: When using the kill or pkill command, you should operate carefully to ensure the correctness of terminating the process. If a critical system process or service process is accidentally killed, it may cause serious problems in the system.
