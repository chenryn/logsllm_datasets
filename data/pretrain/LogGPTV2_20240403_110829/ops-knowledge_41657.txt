User: I want to use the soundcloud python library in a web app I am developing in Google App Engine.   However, I can't find any file called "soundcloud.py" in the soundcloud library files I downloaded.  When using pip install it works fine on my local computer.
What files exactly do I need to move - or what exact steps do I need to take - in order to be able to "import soundcloud" within Google App Engine.
I already tried moving all the *.py files into my main app directory, but still got this error:
import soundcloud
ImportError: No module named soundcloud
Assistant: Ok, I think I figured out.  What I needed to do what copy the soundcloud folder, along with the fudge, simplejson and requests folders into the root folder of my webapp.  Thank you VooDooNOFX -- although you didn't directly answer the precise question, you sparked the thinking that helped me figure it out.
