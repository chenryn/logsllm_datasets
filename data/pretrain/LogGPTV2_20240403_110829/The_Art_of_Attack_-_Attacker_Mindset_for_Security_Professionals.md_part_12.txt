this country. “I will just phone up to James, I am sure he can come
down and sort this.” As I said it, I continued sorting the paperwork
back into its proper order.
“Don’t go anywhere. I will be at the desk checking into this.”
Literally the minute he turned the corner, I darted into the ele-
vator. This move was my least brilliant idea of the operation. Of
course, you needed a card to get the elevator to move so much as an
inch. My saving grace was that the security guard probably wasn’t
at his desk to see my idiocy on CCTV. As I sat back down, though,
resuming my position as a hurried lawyer, now dialing her boss,
luck came rolling through the turnstile in a three-p iece suit. As a
six- foot, brown-h aired, shiny- shoed man made his way to the eleva-
tor bank, so did I. “Yep, I am on the way up!” I said into the phone.
We stood in the elevator with me praying social norms would
prevail. After what in hindsight was probably 5 seconds, but at the
time felt like 3 weeks, this elevator hero said, “35 as well?”
“That’s the one,” I said back as smoothly as I could.
It was not the one. It was three floors short of my intended des-
tination. But it seemed close enough to the target and far enough
from the security guard.
After some small talk, the elevator doors opened, and I was
greeted by yet another set of turnstiles that I most definitely did not
have a fake card for now. I let my elevator companion go ahead as
I stayed back, again pretending to be on the phone. “Hey, James.
I won’t be long. I just have to make one call out here, and I’ll be
Curiosity, Persistence, and Agility 95
straight in . . . yeah, I know. I’m sorry, I will apologize profusely when
I get in. See you in a few!” After correctly assuming the coast was
clear, I did what any respectable female social engineer would: I
sucked in my belly like I was expecting to get punched, tilted my
pelvis, and slid through a rather tight gap between the turnstile and
the side gate.
It wasn’t ideal, but I was at least able to move about somewhat
freely now. I darted 30 feet down the corridor toward a sign beck-
oning me with its little stick figures. The bathrooms. I took out my
phone and, for the first time that day, attempted to make actual con-
tact with someone other than my imagination. When my teammate
picked up, I offered him what I thought was a fair solution to a
potentially growing problem 35 stories beneath me: “You’re going
to have to spoof an internal number and tell that security guard I
am up here and that ‘you’ will escort me down later for my badge
and ID.” After a little back and forth on the details, he agreed. Now
I was left with finding the solution to my newest problem: getting
three stories up without a key card for the elevator.
There was one thing that would definitely help me: continued
persistence.
Skills and Common Sense
There’s generic common sense, and there’s professional common
sense. A good measure of both is often advantageous. However, it’s
somewhat a dual modality for an ethical attack. Let’s consider what
“professional” common sense is.
Professional Common Sense
Professional common sense diverges from traditional common sense
only slightly; the latter dictates you use practical judgment concern-
ing everyday matters or have a basic ability to perceive, understand,
and judge—t his is common to nearly all people. Professional com-
mon sense dictates that we do that all of those things, but at work.
96 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
Professional common sense is essentially a collection of buz-
zwords that are meant to transcend personality types. Most
organizations would list trustworthy, competent, respectful,
courteous, dependable, cooperative, committed, approachable,
accountable, steady— the list goes on and on. However, much of
this is the antithesis of our jobs as attackers, right? How can we be
trustworthy, competent, respectful, courteous, dependable, coop-
erative, and steady when our jobs boil down to being dishonest, not
having a clue about our pretext’s job, influencing another human for
our own gain, and pivoting at any given opportunity? Well, there’s
another way to look at common sense: from the viewpoint of the
attacker. It starts with a hard-a nd- fast rule: stick to the scope of the
job as given by the client. You apply the rest to yourself as follows:
Trustworthiness When you are hired to do a job, there is an
expectation that you will not take advantage of your power. It’s such
a fine line for a client to trust you to take advantage of their disad-
vantage. You cannot exploit it for your own personal or selfish gain.
Maturity Being an EA is not a license to act however you feel
or carry out dangerous or daring activities on a whim. You should
never overreact when things go wrong or use high- stress situa-
tions to cover for a poor attitude or inability to deal with pressure.
Maturity means you act responsibly and respectfully at all times.
Respect Respect must be conveyed not only in your actions but
in your attitude. Maintaining a respectful tone and nature is two-
fold: you must apply this against your targets as the attacker in
motion and apply it against your teammates and the client.
Competence Since every attack may require something differ-
ent of you, there is a self- driving incentive to learn new techniques
and tools. Learning to pick a lock, write exploits (code that takes
advantage of a software vulnerability or security flaw), and carry
out surveillance are legitimate and valuable skills. If the route
you’ve planned requires something of you that you are not famil-
iar with and that could prove damaging to the attack or to your tar-
get and their environment, you should reconsider your approach.
Curiosity, Persistence, and Agility 97
Dependability As an attacker, you must be dependable. You
cannot flake out on jobs. It’s not just a matter of your reputation
being diluted or chipped away. You may be headed for serious legal
proceedings if you fail to execute as expected.
Cooperation As a professional attacker, you must be able to
work with the client’s fears. Working hand in hand with a client,
even after you’ve offered advice to better a campaign or opera-
tion, is needed and needed often. Not all clients want a full attack
mounted on them, and some don’t want their most valuable assets
gamified. However, you should remain accommodating and will-
ing to work with the environment given.
Approachability Being approachable is one of the highest
value skills you can offer your client. I urge all of us as attackers
to stay away from buzzwords and industry terms when talking to
someone outside of our field. As an EA and a professional, com-
municating with someone on their level will generally serve your
needs more expediently.
Compartmentalization Compartmentalizing helps stress man-
agement as it can reduce anxiety as well as tension. Sometimes
being able to mentally compartmentalize means being able to
avoid mental discomfort. The act of mentally compartmentalizing
is singling out an issue and applying all your energy and attention
to it. In psychology, compartmentalizing is considered a defense or
coping mechanism. Put simply, it’s how our minds deal with con-
flicting internal standpoints simultaneously, and internal conflicts
can be plentiful as an attacker. There are a few steps you can take to
help ease the mental burden of the job though:
1. Isolate the issues from all the other challenges you are dealing
with—personal and professional.
2. Focus on each isolated issue, moving forward in incremental steps.
3. Accept that you can go between isolated issues if progress in
one area cannot be made.
4. Do not ruminate if you are not solving. Thinking about some-
thing, replaying a moment or situation or reimagining an
98 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
internal narrative over and over is a catastrophic thought pat-
tern. Learn to apply solutions (typically for future events) to
what you are thinking about.
Finally, to compartmentalize, you have to be able to stomach
the idea that, no matter what you do, you are not the only person
who can do that job. There are literally backups for brain surgeons.
That’s not meant to make you feel lesser; it’s not to say you won’t do
the job better or differently, but sometimes compartmentalization
means isolating yourself from the project when need be.
Summary
• Curiosity is on a spectrum but is most often persistence’s
driving force.
• The best way to bait curiosity is to ask questions and then persist
in the pursuit of satisfactory answers.
• You will need persistence at all stages of a job and to have it as a
cornerstone of your own mindset. Giving up easily is not a good
trait for this industry.
• Mental agility forms part of the holy trifecta, too. You have to be
able to use information multiple ways for multiple outcomes,
especially when you need to pivot because something is not
panning out as you’d expected it to.
• Common sense, both in the traditional sense and the profes-
sional sense, are prerequisites for the ability to perform well.
• Ethics are not abstained from simply because of the nature of our
jobs as attackers. They are a fundamental feature of the mindset.
Key Message
Curiosity is a strong driving force of any attack— ethical or mali-
cious. It serves as a driving force in the pursuit of information and
knowledge. Persistence cannot exist without a goal. Morals are
at play for the sake of the greater good, and they influence each
moment in your intentions as an ethical attacker.

Observation and Thinking
Techniques
A long habit of not thinking a thing wrong, gives it a superficial
appearance of being right. . . Time makes more converts
than reason.

P
rocessing information to weaponize and leverage is a nec-
cessary cognitive skill to get into the attacker mindset and
use it to its greatest potential. To process information, you
have to collect it. You can collect information four main ways: by
obtaining, observing, theorizing, and inferring. If you choose the
latter two, you will then have to search for information to validate
your thoughts.
99
100 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
After you have collected the information, you have to parse it.
You will then put it in one of these three buckets:
• Recon: Made up of information that familiarizes you with your
targets and their environments
• Pretext: Consists of information that you can directly weaponize
in order to disguise yourself as a threat
• Disregard: Consists of items that aren’t useful in either of these
ways— information you simply dismiss
Once you’ve decided which bucket the information should go in,
you have to weaponize it within its limits, which means not stretch-
ing the information for more than it’s worth. For example, knowing
a company uses Splunk doesn’t permit you to call up impersonating
a system administrator, security engineer, or Splunk administra-
tor. You will likely not have enough information to fulfill your call
objective if you hope to learn more than just how the organization
reacts to your advances. For example, you cannot infer from a com-
pany’s use of Splunk which other software it uses. Splunk itself is a
software platform that can search, analyze, and visualize machine-
generated data gathered from websites, applications, and so forth. It
is helpful enough to go into the recon and pretext buckets, but you
will need more than that information alone.
You have to collect information to process it, but in many
instances, you must observe information, too. In this chapter, we
will deal primarily with observation. Observation is not just passive
viewing—i t’s an active mental process. French physiologist Claude
Bernard (1813–1878) distinguished two types of observation: (1)
spontaneous or passive observations, which are unexpected, and (2)
induced or active observations, which are deliberately sought. Effec-
tive spontaneous observation involves first noticing some object or
event haphazardly. The thing noticed will usually become significant
only if your mind either consciously or unconsciously relates it to
relevant knowledge or remembered past experience. However, con-
sciously choosing to think about something that you know nothing
about might lead you to reasoning, further research, or inference—
which will require a healthy dose of curiosity and persistence.
Information Processing 101
Observation is a tricky subject, though. Simple observations can
be computed in multiple ways. Through the lens of observation, we’ll
discuss intuition and heuristics, rationale, and reason, all of which we
will have to, at some point, rely on as attackers. This is why picking
apart observation is so vital; with the ability to observe your surround-
ings and targets accurately, you can process information with more
confidence and a higher likelihood of effecting real influence.
Observation’s driving force is attention. I once worked on a job
that required detailed and ‘‘in the weeds’’ type of observation to
achieve any meaningful facts. In this case, I was passed 10 or so
images that were seemingly benign. They were images that I hoped
would reveal the location of someone being tracked due to their
criminal activity. Figure 6.1–Figure 6.4 show some of the images.
Figure 6.1 Photo A
102 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
My observations of Photo A started with an unfair disadvantage;
I live in Los Angeles and recognized right away where that photo
was taken—this went from observation to inference quite quickly.
There were three other facts I was able to identify, the first
almost immediately, although the rest took some research. The
first thing I noticed was that a woman’s bag is pictured and
potentially taken from her point of view. The image also shows
pre- tuned radio stations; 102.7FM is KISS FM, and 101.9FM is
KSCA, a commercial FM radio station licensed to Glendale, Cali-
fornia and broadcasting to the Greater Los Angeles area. It is also
a Spanish- speaking broadcast. The audio system console shown
strongly resembles that of a Ford, possibly a Ford Focus, although
that took some further research to find. An ExifTool metadata
probe of these images also showed that they were taken on a
Motorola phone.
Photo B contains a bit of a gift as far as investigations go:
a receipt.
From here, you can see that the image must have been taken
on or after 05/18/2020. The time is printed as either 14:48 or 14:46.
Photo C shows a mask, from which I can infer this picture was
taken no earlier than 2020 due to COVID 19— not many of us in the
West were wearing masks prior to that, and there is no evidence to
support either of the people (the driver or the picture taker) were
in the medical field. The mask also has what appears to be makeup
transfer on it, further leading me to believe that the man I was track-
ing was with a woman. The one other thing to note is that the cable
doesn’t appear to be an iPhone cable. I cannot say for certain, since
I don’t have that expertise, but I would say that the ExifTool data I
found supports this theory.
Your Brain vs. Your Observation
Your brain isn’t wired to see everything. It focuses on specific
things— such as the fact that Photo A and Photo C are two com-
pletely different cars—a nd filters out everything else. Some of you
Information Processing 103
Figure 6.2 Photo B
may have neglected that detail, whereas others noticed it. That level
of observation is to your benefit most of the time because, if you
paid attention to everything, you’d often miss what’s important.
Because your brain is hardwired to disregard details and you
are, essentially, incapable of appreciating more than just a sliver of
your surroundings, you must train your brain to reconsider what it
sees as important. To train yourself in this way, it is extremely help-
ful to understand why our brains function the way they do. In every
sensory moment, our brains are swimming in a deluge of input.
The information that you are aware of or can recall later is relevant
to you at that specific time. Let me explain: If you’re a tourist in a
new city, the type of stores you notice (and later recall) will differ
104 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
Figure 6.3 Photo B zoomed in
depending on your interests and needs at the time. If you are hun-
gry or thirsty, you’ll most likely notice cafes and restaurants. If you
are interested in architecture, you will likely notice buildings and
be able to recall them in better detail than someone else, say, just
looking for a cab. If you’re scanning a guest list for your name, you
are not likely to notice names with configurations different from
your own. If you’re looking for a friend in a crowd with brown hair,
you will not focus on people with any other color of hair.
If I am walking into my friend’s house for the first time, I don’t
need to know what color their front door is—t hat’s rarely served me
before. Thankfully, society went with using street names and num-
bers as a way to identify house positions and not the color of the
houses and their parts. If we’d have gone the other way, my brain
would’ve been taught that color and hue were the important details
to observe and remember as they relate to homes, which is the
key here: you can re-t each your brain what is important to notice,
especially relating to engagements. In other words, you must use
your limited resources wisely and to attend to those features that
Information Processing 105

are most important. It might sound counterintuitive that the best
way to train yourself how to observe efficiently is to learn what to
