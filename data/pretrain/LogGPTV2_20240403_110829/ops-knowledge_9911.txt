User: I am creating Windows service class in Python that will eventually display a Window when certain conditions are met. Since (as I understand it) services cannot have GUIs, I'm trying to start up a GUI in a seperate process (using subprocess.Popen) when the conditions are right. This isn't working, presumably because the child process has the same privileges as the service.
So how do I start a process from a Python Windows Service that has the ability to display GUIs on the screen?
Assistant: If you give your Service the Allow service to interact with desktop permission it will be able to create windows without the need to launch a subprocess.
