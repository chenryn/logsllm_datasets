Question: A mobile application development company is working on an app that requires extensive logging of system interactions for debugging purposes. Considering the security model of Android, which SELinux mode should the developers initially configure to maximize logging capabilities while developing the app, and why might they choose to switch modes before releasing the app?
"A": "Initially configure SELinux in permissive mode to log permission denials without enforcing them, then switch to enforcing mode before app release to prevent disallowed actions.",
"B": "Initially configure SELinux in enforcing mode to prevent and log disallowed actions, then switch to permissive mode before app release to log permission denials.",
"C": "Keep SELinux in per-domain permissive mode throughout development and release to incrementally apply SELinux to the app.",
"D": "Disable SELinux during development for unrestricted logging, and enable it in enforcing mode before app release."
Answer: A
