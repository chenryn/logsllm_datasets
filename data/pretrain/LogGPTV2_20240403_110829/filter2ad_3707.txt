## Abstract
Large-scale darknet monitoring is an effective method for understanding global trends in malicious activities on the Internet, such as the worldwide spread of malware. However, there has been a gap between darknet monitoring and practical security operations on live networks, as global trends have limited direct contributions to protecting these networks. To address this, we propose a novel application of large-scale darknet monitoring that significantly enhances the security of live networks. Unlike traditional methods that observe packets from external sources, our approach uses a large-scale, distributed darknet consisting of multiple organizations that mutually monitor malicious packets originating from within their own networks. Based on this, we have developed an alert system called DAEDALUS (Direct Alert Environment for Darknet and Livenet Unified Security). This paper presents the primary experimental results obtained from the actual deployment of DAEDALUS.

## Introduction
The Internet faces significant amounts of unwanted traffic and attacks, primarily caused by malware. One effective way to understand global trends in malicious activities, such as the spread of malware, is to monitor a large-scale darknet (a set of globally announced unused IP addresses) [1,2]. However, there has been a gap between darknet monitoring and practical security operations on live networks (referred to as livenets), which include legitimate hosts, servers, and network devices. For example, while darknet monitoring can inform network operators about a global increase in scans on port 80/tcp, it does not ensure that specific security actions are taken. This means that darknet monitoring has not significantly contributed to the protection of livenets. Therefore, we propose a novel application of large-scale darknet monitoring that significantly enhances the security of livenets. Unlike traditional methods that observe packets received from the outside, we employ a large-scale, distributed darknet that consists of several organizations that mutually monitor malicious packets transmitted from within their own networks. Based on this approach, we have developed an alert system called DAEDALUS (Direct Alert Environment for Darknet and Livenet Unified Security), illustrated in Figure 1.

## DAEDALUS Overview
DAEDALUS consists of an analysis center and several participating organizations (referred to as "orgs"). Each org establishes a secure channel with the analysis center and continuously forwards darknet traffic to the center. Additionally, each org registers the IP address range of its livenet with the center beforehand. We categorize the darknet into two types: internal and external. From an org's perspective, the darknet within the org is an internal darknet, and the darknets in other orgs are external darknets.

When a malware infection occurs, for example, in org G (Figure 1(a)), and the infected host starts scanning the internal darknet, the analysis center can detect the infection by matching the source IP address of the darknet traffic from org G with the preregistered livenet IP address. The analysis center then sends an internal darknet alert to org G. If the infected host starts scanning the external darknet in another org, such as org A (Figure 1(b)), the analysis center can detect the infection in the same manner and send an external darknet alert to org G. These alerts include information on the IP address of the infected host, protocol, source/destination ports, duration of the attack, and any analysis results.

## Experimental Results
We conducted a trial of DAEDALUS using the darknet resources of Nicter [3]. With a /16 mixed network of livenet and darknet (as the preregistered livenet and internal darknet) and a pure /16 darknet (as the external darknet), over 2,500 internal darknet alerts and 9 external darknet alerts were issued in a month (July 2008). Some of these alerts triggered actual security operations in the org that owns the livenet.
