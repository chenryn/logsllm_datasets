Abstract.  Large-scale  darknet  monitoring  is  an  effective  approach  to  grasp  a 
global  trend  of  malicious  activities  on  the  Internet,  such  as  the  world-wide 
spread  of  malwares.  There,  however,  have  been  a  gap  between  the  darknet 
monitoring and actual security operations on live networks, namely the global 
trend  has  less  direct  contribution  to  protect  the  live  networks.  Therefore,  we 
propose a novel application of large-scale darknet monitoring that significantly 
contributes  to  the  security  of  live  networks.  In  contrast  to  the  conventional 
method, wherein the packets received from the outside are observed, we employ 
a large-scale distributed darknet that consists of several organizations that mu-
tually observe the malicious packets transmitted from the inside of the organiza-
tions.  Based  on  this  approach,  we  have  developed  an  alert  system  called 
DAEDALUS (direct alert environment for darknet and livenet unified security). 
We present the primary experimental results obtained from the actual deploy-
ment of DAEDALUS. 
Keywords: darknet monitoring, live network protection, alert system. 
The Internet encounters considerable amounts of unwanted traffic and attacks, which 
are mostly caused by malwares. An effective approach to grasp a global trend of ma-
licious activities such as the spread of malwares is to monitor a large-scale darknet (a 
set  of  globally  announced  unused  IP  addresses)  [1,2]. There,  however,  have  been  a 
gap  between  the  darknet  monitoring  and  actual  security  operations  on  the  live  net-
work (hereafter referred to as livenet), which comprises legitimate hosts, servers and 
network  devices.  For  instance,  although  darknet  monitoring  can  be  used  to  inform 
network  operators  about  a  global  increase  in  scan  on  80/tcp,  it  may  not  ensure  that 
any concrete security operations are carried out. This means that darknet monitoring 
does not significantly contribute to the protection of the livenet. Therefore,  we pro-
pose a novel application of large-scale darknet monitoring that significantly contrib-
utes to the security of the livenet. In contrast to the conventional method wherein the 
packets received from the outside are observed, we employ a large-scale distributed 
darknet  that  consists  of  several  organizations  that  mutually  observe  the  malicious 
packets transmitted from the inside of the organizations. Based on this approach, we 
have  developed  an  alert  system  called  DAEDALUS  (direct  alert  environment  for 
darknet and livenet unified security), which is illustrated in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1. Overview of DAEDALUS 
DAEDALUS consists of an analysis center and several organizations. Each organi-
zation  (hereafter  referred  to  as  org)  establishes  a  secure  channel  with  the  analysis 
center and continuously forwards darknet traffic toward the center. In addition, each 
org registers the IP address range of its livenet to the center beforehand. We divide 
the darknet into two types—internal and external darknet. From the viewpoint of an 
org, the darknet within the org is an internal darknet, and the darknets in other orgs 
are external darknets. 
When  a  malware  infection  occurs,  e.g.,  in  org  G  in  Fig.  1,  and  the  infected  host 
starts  scanning  the  inside  of  the  org,  including  the  internal  darknet  (Fig.  1  (a)),  the 
analysis center can detect the infection on the basis of the match between the source 
IP address of darknet traffic from the org G and the preregistered livenet IP address. 
The analysis center then sends an internal darknet alert to org G. When the infected 
host starts scanning the outside, including the external darknet in org A (Fig. 1 (b)), 
the analysis center can detect the infection in the same above-mentioned manner. The 
analysis center then sends an external darknet alert to org G. The alerts include infor-
mation on the IP address of the infected host, protocol, source/destination ports, dura-
tion of attack, and analysis results, if any. 
We are conducting a trial of DAEDALUS by using the darknet resources of nicter 
[3]. With a /16 mixed network of livenet and darknet (as the preregistered livenet and 
internal darknet) and a pure/16 darknet (as the external darknet), over 2,500 internal 
darknet alerts and 9 external darknet alerts were issued in a month (July 2008), some 
of the alerts triggered actual security operations in the org that owns the livenet.
