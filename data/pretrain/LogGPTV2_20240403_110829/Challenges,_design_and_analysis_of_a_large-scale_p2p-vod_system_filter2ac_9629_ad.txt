### Health Index Analysis

To obtain a finer granularity of the health index, we compare the number of replications of each chunk to the total demand for that chunk. The total number of demands for each chunk in one day is derived from user behavior data, MVRs, and collected at the same measurement time as the health index data (from 00:00, January 6, 2008, to 24:00, January 6, 2008). Based on the starting viewing time (ST), ending viewing time (ET), and the starting position (SP), one can determine which chunks a peer demanded during the viewing action.

**Figure 11: Comparison of the number of replicated chunks and chunk demand for three movies in one day.**

From the figure, we can conclude:
- The health index for these three movies is very good since the number of replicated chunks is much higher than the workload demand.
- The large fluctuation in chunk availability for Movie 2 is due to high user interactivity.
- Users tend to skip the last chunk of the movie (which corresponds to the movie epilog). To improve the quality of viewing, an anchor point may be provided at that position.

### Available to Demand Ratio

The available to demand ratio (ATD) for a chunk \(i\) at time \(t\) is given by:

\[
ATDi(t) = \frac{\text{Number of replicated chunk } i \text{ at } t}{\text{Number of demand for chunk } i \text{ at } t}
\]

The ATD for a movie \(m\) at time \(t\) is:

\[
ATDm(t) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} ATDi(t)
\]

where \(N\) is the total number of chunks for movie \(m\).

**Figure 12: The ratio of the number of available chunks to the demanded chunks within one day.**

**Figure 13: Temporal means and standard deviations of the number of replicas of all chunks of these three movies within one day.**

From Figure 12, we observe that \(ATDi(t) \geq 3\) for all times \(t\). This indicates that the replication health of these video objects is very good. Additionally, Figure 13 shows that these three movies have high temporal means and low standard deviations, indicating overall good replication health.

### User Satisfaction Index

The user satisfaction index measures the quality of viewing as experienced by users. A low user satisfaction index implies that peers are unhappy and may choose to leave the system, reducing the service capacity and scalability of the P2P-VoD system.

To measure the user satisfaction index, we use the fluency \(F(m, i)\) as defined in Equation (1). The computation of \(F(m, i)\) is carried out by the client software, which examines all MVRs generated during the viewing period. The client software reports all MVRs and the fluency \(F(m, i)\) to the log server whenever a "stop-watching" event occurs.

**Figure 14: Example of generating the fluency index.**

**Figure 15: Number of fluency records reported by users to the log server.**

Figure 15 shows the number of fluency records reported to the log server at different times during the one-day period. The number of viewers drops after 01:00, increases after 09:00, and reaches its peak around 16:00. The number of viewers drops afterward but picks up again after 19:00, reaching the second peak at 24:00.

**Figure 16: Distribution of fluency index of these three movies within a 24-hour period.**

The fluency interval [0, 1] is divided into ten sub-intervals: [0, 0.1), [0.1, 0.2), ..., [0.9, 1.0). A fluency value greater than 0.8 is considered acceptable.

### Server Load and Memory Usage

The server has implemented the memory-pool technique, making memory usage more efficient. This can be observed in the bottom sub-figure of Figure 18, where the memory usage is very stable.

**Figure 18: Memory usage and server load over a 24-hour period.**

This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the health, replication, and user satisfaction indices of the P2P-VoD system, ensuring optimal performance and user experience.
