**Code Example and Error Explanation:**

Consider the following code snippet:

```python
t = [[1]]
p = [[0]]
metrics.ndcg_score(t, p)
```

When executed, this code results in the following traceback:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in 
  File "/Users/cbournhonesque/.pyenv/versions/bento/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sklearn/utils/validation.py", line 63, in inner_f
    return f(*args, **kwargs)
  File "/Users/cbournhonesque/.pyenv/versions/bento/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sklearn/metrics/_ranking.py", line 1567, in ndcg_score
    _check_dcg_target_type(y_true)
  File "/Users/cbournhonesque/.pyenv/versions/bento/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sklearn/metrics/_ranking.py", line 1307, in _check_dcg_target_type
    raise ValueError(
ValueError: Only ('multilabel-indicator', 'continuous-multioutput', 'multiclass-multioutput') formats are supported. Got binary instead.
```

The error indicates that the `ndcg_score` function from `sklearn.metrics` only supports specific formats for the true relevance scores (`y_true`), namely 'multilabel-indicator', 'continuous-multioutput', and 'multiclass-multioutput'. The provided input, which is a single binary value, does not match any of these formats.

**Solution:**

The `ndcg_score` function works correctly when the number of elements is greater than one. For example, if you have more than one element, the function will execute without errors.
