Hacking Motion Sickness on the 
Cheap
INTRODUCTION
Motion Sickness
• No universally accepted definition
• Defined by signs and symptoms, which varies
• Agreed that it came about when man first 
tried to improve natural mobility
• Greeks had first recorded account, occurred at 
sea
– Where the term nausea came from
• “naus-” meaning of the sea
• “-ea” being related to sick
Statistics
• 90% of the world’s population suffer from it at 
one point in their lives
• 300 million sufferers live in the U.S.
– 9 to 75 have debilitating response
– 2 million are forced to visit a doctor
Susceptability
• Predisposition to motion sickness can be 
inherited
• Some races can be more effected than others
Types of Motion Sickness
• Car sickness
• Air sickness (occurs in an aircraft of some sort)
• Sea sickness
• Simulation sickness
Disproven Theories
• “Blood and Guts”
• Result of Respiratory Issues
• Reaction to shock to the central and 
autonomic nervous systems
• Infection similar to Cholera and Yellow Fever
• Overstimulation
FOVEAL SLIP THEORY
Overview of Foveal Slip
• Fixation disparity leads to lack of visual acuity
• Occurs when there is a misalignment of the 
eye
• Can be horizontal and/or vertical
• Results in over- or under-convergence of eyes 
at a fixation point
• Misalignment of the fovea is only a few 
arcminutes
– One-sixtieth (1/60) of a degree
• Foveal slip eventually leads to depth 
perception problems
Fovea
• Located in the center of the Macula region
– Oval-shaped, yellow spot
– Near the center of the retina
• Responsible for central vision
– Reading
– Driving
– Watching tv or movies
Foveal Slip and Motion Sickness
It’s hypothesized that motion sickness that 
occurs during opti-kinetic stimulation is a 
result of foveal slip. As a result, an increase of 
foveal slip more often than not results in an 
increase of symptoms associated with motion 
sickness.
MOTOR-SENSORY CONFLICT 
THEORY
The Theory
States that motion sickness is a defense 
mechanism against neurotoxins and is 
triggered when sensory information (usually 
visual) about the body’s position and 
movement is contradictory to the movement 
that is being sensed by your vestibular system, 
resulting in your body being unable to reach a 
state of homeostasis (basically a sense of 
balance).
Vestibular System
• Responsible for our balance and sense of 
spatial orientation
• Movement causes fluid from the 
endolymphatic sac to push against the cupula
• Cupula has hairs that translates mechanical 
movement into electrical signals
For the engineers…
• The semicircular canals can be compared to a 
damped oscillator:
• For humans, the time constants T1 and T2 are 
approximately 3 ms and 5 s, respectively. 
• For typical head movements, which cover the 
frequency range of 0.1 Hz and 10 Hz, the 
deflection of the cupula is proportional to 
head-velocity. 
• The velocity of the eyes must be opposite to 
the velocity of the head in order to have clear 
vision.
CURRENT PREVENTION 
TECHNIQUES AND “TREATMENT”
Prevention
• Sitting where motion is felt the least
• Don’t read
• Keeping head and body still
• Face forward in a reclining position
• Keep eyes on the horizon
• Keep window open
• Don’t drink or smoke
• Eating small, low-fat, bland, and starchy foods
Natural Healing
• Powder or liquid ginger
• Use acupuncture, acupressure, or mild 
electrical pulse at:
– Neiguian or Pericardium (3 finger widths above 
the wrist)
– Small intestine 17 (just below the earlobes, in the 
indentations behind the jawbone)
Drugs!
• Diphenhydramine
– Active ingredient in sleep aids
– Cannot be used with infants
– Not good for elderly, pregnant, or breast-feeders
– Not good for people with glaucoma, heart disease, 
constipation, or enlarged prostate
Drugs! (Cont.)
• Antihistamines
– Most effective 30-60 minutes before a trip
– Side effect: drowsiness and less alert
– Shouldn’t be used by people with emphysema or 
bronchitis
DAS GOODS
Auroscillator
• Little box that produces a sound in the .01-10 
kHz range
• Works using the motor-sensory theory as a 
basis
• It imitates the moving of your head in order to 
trick the brain
Material list, cost and schematics to 
be shown during the presentation.
Stroboscopic Glasses
• Lights flash at 20 Hz with 8 ms dwell time
• Mounted just outside the wearer’s peripheral 
vision
• Shouldn’t cause epileptic seizures
• Prevents your eyes from going into a foveal
slip
Material list, cost and schematics 
to be shown during the 
presentation.
