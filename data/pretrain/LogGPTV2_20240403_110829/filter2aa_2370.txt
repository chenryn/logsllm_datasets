### Good Vibrations: Hacking Motion Sickness on the Cheap

#### Introduction
**Motion Sickness**
- **Definition:** There is no universally accepted definition, but it is generally characterized by a set of signs and symptoms.
- **Historical Context:** The condition likely emerged when humans first sought to enhance their natural mobility. The ancient Greeks recorded the first known accounts of motion sickness, which occurred at sea. The term "nausea" originates from the Greek words "naus-" (of the sea) and "-ea" (sick).
- **Statistics:**
  - Approximately 90% of the world's population experiences motion sickness at some point in their lives.
  - In the U.S., about 300 million people suffer from it, with 9 to 75% experiencing debilitating symptoms, and 2 million seeking medical attention.

**Susceptibility**
- Predisposition to motion sickness can be hereditary.
- Some racial groups may be more susceptible than others.

**Types of Motion Sickness**
- Car sickness
- Air sickness (in aircraft)
- Sea sickness
- Simulation sickness

**Disproven Theories**
- Blood and Guts
- Respiratory issues
- Shock to the central and autonomic nervous systems
- Infection similar to Cholera and Yellow Fever
- Overstimulation

#### Foveal Slip Theory
**Overview of Foveal Slip**
- **Fixation Disparity:** This leads to a lack of visual acuity due to misalignment of the eyes, which can be horizontal and/or vertical.
- **Convergence Issues:** Misalignment results in over- or under-convergence of the eyes at a fixation point.
- **Foveal Misalignment:** The fovea, located in the center of the macula (an oval-shaped, yellow spot near the center of the retina responsible for central vision), can misalign by a few arcminutes (one-sixtieth of a degree). This misalignment can lead to depth perception problems.
- **Hypothesis:** It is hypothesized that foveal slip during optokinetic stimulation contributes to motion sickness. An increase in foveal slip often correlates with an increase in motion sickness symptoms.

#### Motor-Sensory Conflict Theory
**The Theory**
- This theory posits that motion sickness is a defense mechanism against neurotoxins. It is triggered when sensory information (usually visual) about the body's position and movement conflicts with the movement sensed by the vestibular system, leading to a loss of homeostasis (balance).

**Vestibular System**
- **Function:** Responsible for balance and spatial orientation.
- **Mechanism:** Movement causes fluid in the endolymphatic sac to push against the cupula, which has hairs that translate mechanical movement into electrical signals.
- **Engineering Analogy:** The semicircular canals can be compared to a damped oscillator. For humans, the time constants T1 and T2 are approximately 3 ms and 5 s, respectively. For typical head movements (0.1 Hz to 10 Hz), the deflection of the cupula is proportional to head velocity. To maintain clear vision, eye velocity must be opposite to head velocity.

#### Current Prevention Techniques and Treatments
**Prevention**
- Sit where motion is least felt.
- Avoid reading.
- Keep head and body still.
- Face forward in a reclining position.
- Focus on the horizon.
- Keep windows open.
- Avoid drinking and smoking.
- Eat small, low-fat, bland, and starchy foods.

**Natural Healing**
- Ginger (powder or liquid form).
- Acupuncture, acupressure, or mild electrical pulse at:
  - Neiguan (Pericardium 6, 3 finger widths above the wrist)
  - Small Intestine 17 (just below the earlobes, in the indentations behind the jawbone)

**Pharmacological Treatments**
- **Diphenhydramine:**
  - Active ingredient in sleep aids.
  - Not suitable for infants, elderly, pregnant, or breastfeeding individuals.
  - Contraindicated for those with glaucoma, heart disease, constipation, or enlarged prostate.
- **Antihistamines:**
  - Most effective 30-60 minutes before travel.
  - Side effects include drowsiness and reduced alertness.
  - Not recommended for people with emphysema or bronchitis.

#### Innovative Solutions
**Auroscillator**
- **Description:** A small device that produces sound in the .01-10 kHz range.
- **Mechanism:** Based on the motor-sensory conflict theory, it imitates head movement to trick the brain.
- **Details:** Material list, cost, and schematics will be provided during the presentation.

**Stroboscopic Glasses**
- **Description:** Lights flash at 20 Hz with an 8 ms dwell time, mounted just outside the wearerâ€™s peripheral vision.
- **Safety:** Should not cause epileptic seizures.
- **Function:** Prevents foveal slip.
- **Details:** Material list, cost, and schematics will be provided during the presentation.
