Abstract. This paper presents a ﬁrst example of secure identity based
encryption scheme (IBE) without redundancy in the sense of Phan and
Pointcheval. This modiﬁcation of the Boneh-Franklin IBE is an hybrid
construction that is proved to be secure (using proof techniques bor-
rowed from those for KEM-DEM constructions) in the random oracle
model under a slightly stronger assumption than the original IBE and
turns out to be more eﬃcient at decryption than the latter. A second con-
tribution of this work is to show how to shorten ciphertexts in a recently
proposed multiple-recipient IBE scheme. Our modiﬁcation of the latter
scheme spares about 1180 bits from a bandwidth point of view as, some-
what surprisingly, redundancies are not needed although all elements
of the ciphertext space are not reachable by the encryption mapping.
This shows that in public key encryption schemes, redundancies may be
useless even when the encryption mapping is not a surjection.
Keywords: ID-based encryption, provable security, redundancies.
1 Introduction
Identity based cryptosystems were introduced by Shamir in 1984 [35] in order
to simplify key management and avoid the use of digital certiﬁcates by letting
a public key be publicly derivable from a human-memorizable information on
its owner (e-mail address, IP address combined to a user name,...) while the
associated private keys must be computed by a trusted Private Key Generator
(PKG) thanks to a master secret. This paradigm avoids key management prob-
lems arising in traditional public key infrastructures: as long as a public key “is”
its owner’s identity, nothing must be certiﬁed except the PKG’s public key and
a single public key per domain is thus needed.
Finding a practical identity based encryption scheme (IBE) remained an
long-standing open challenge until two independent works of Boneh-Franklin
[10] and Cocks [14] which appeared in 2001. Among those solutions, Boneh and
Franklin’s one happens to be the most practical one.
In provable security purposes, motivated by the design of public key encryp-
tion schemes that provably reach the widely admitted required level of security
against adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks [34] in the random oracle model [6],

Bellare and Rogaway introduced the notion of plaintext-awareness [7] that cap-
tures the general idea to render a decryption oracle useless by making impossible
the creation of valid ciphertexts by the adversary. As mentioned in [21], several
works [2, 13, 20, 31, 33], gave (knowingly or not) evidence that chosen-ciphertext
security is achievable without plaintext-awareness in the random oracle model.
Among them, salient results of Phan and Pointcheval [31, 33] showed designs
of strongly secure [34] public key encryption schemes for which all ciphertexts
are valid and have a corresponding plaintext. Those results were very recently
extended by a work [13] exhibiting a ‘redundancy-optimal’ generic construction
of IND-CCA secure public key encryption.
Meanwhile, Kurosawa and Matsuo [28] showed how to turn the DHIES [1]
hybrid construction into a redundancy-free encryption scheme in the standard
model (but under the non-standard oracle Diﬃe-Hellman assumption that ac-
tually looks as strong as the random oracle model) by removing the message
authentication code (MAC) and replacing the IND-CPA symmetric encryp-
tion scheme with an IND-CCA one. Their approach is actually a KEM-DEM
[17, 18, 36] construction that can also be proved secure in the random oracle
model under a more standard assumption in the same way as the oracle Diﬃe-
Hellman assumption was shown [1] to imply the Gap Diﬃe-Hellman assumption
[30] in the random oracle model.
The contribution of the present paper is two-fold. We ﬁrst extend the tech-
nique of Kurosawa and Matsuo to the identity based setting in the random
oracle model and show a hybrid variant of the Boneh-Franklin IBE [10] that
reaches the IND-ID-CCA2 security level (under a slightly stronger assumption)
without introducing redundancies in ciphertexts that are thus shorter than in
the FullIdent scheme of [10]. As a side eﬀect, the decryption operation is more
eﬃcient in the resulting scheme than its counterpart in the fully secure original
IBE [10]. We mention that an independent work [8] of ours recently considered
identity based and certiﬁcateless [3] extensions of KEMs. When combined to a
suitable symmetric encryption scheme, the ﬁrst identity based KEM proposed
in [8] provides a hybrid IBE that is quite similar to ours. However, as explained
in section 3, our variant enjoys a better security reduction in the random oracle
model.
The second contribution of the paper is a method to shorten ciphertexts
produced by a recently proposed [5] multiple-receiver IBE by the size of an RSA
modulus. The modiﬁed scheme has the particulary that, although the encryption
function is not surjective, no validity checking must be performed at decryption
and the decryption algorithm never returns any error message.
2 Preliminaries
2.1 Admissible Bilinear Maps
Let k be a security parameter and q be a k−bit prime number. Let us consider
groups G1 and G2 of the same prime order q. For our purposes, we need a bilinear
map e : G1 × G1 → G2 satisfying the following properties:
Identity Based Encryption Without Redundancy
287
1. Bilinearity: ∀ P, Q ∈ G1, ∀ a, b ∈ Z∗
2. Non-degeneracy: ∀ P ∈ G1, e(P, Q) = 1 for all Q ∈ G1 iﬀ P = O.
3. Computability: ∀ P, Q ∈ G1, e(P, Q) can be eﬃciently computed.
As shown in [10], such non-degenerate admissible maps over cyclic groups can
be obtained from the Weil or the Tate pairing over algebraic curves.
q , we have e(aP, bQ) = e(P, Q)ab.
2.2 Underlying Hard Problems
This section recalls deﬁnitions of underlying hard problems on which the security
of our scheme is shown to rely.
Deﬁnition 1. Given groups G1 and G2 of prime order q, a bilinear map e :
G1 × G1 → G2 and a generator P of G1,
– The Bilinear Diﬃe-Hellman Problem (BDH) in (G1, G2) is, given ele-
ments (cid:4)P, aP, bP, cP(cid:5) for unknown a, b, c ∈ Zq, to compute e(P, P )abc ∈ G2.
– The Decision Bilinear Diﬃe-Hellman Problem (DBDH) is to distin-
guish the distributions D1 := {(P, aP, bP, cP, e(P, P )abc)|a, b, c R← Z∗
q} and
q, h R← G2}. Tuples from D1 are denoted
D2 := {(P, aP, bP, cP, h)|a, b, c R← Z∗
as “BDH tuples” in the sequel in contrast to those from D2 which will be
called “random tuples” .
– The Gap Bilinear Diﬃe-Hellman Problem (Gap-BDH) in (G1, G2)
consists of, given (cid:4)P, aP, bP, cP(cid:5), to compute e(P, P )abc with the help of a
DBDH oracle.
The security of the schemes presented in this paper relies on the Gap-BDH
assumption which is the intractability of the latter problem.
2.3 Deﬁnition of IBE
We recall here the formalism introduced in [10] for identity based encryption.
Such a primitive consists of the following algorithms.
Setup: is a probabilistic algorithm run by a private key generator (PKG) that
takes as input a security parameter to output a public/private key pair
(Ppub, mk) for the PKG (Ppub is its public key and mk is its master key that
is kept secret).
Keygen: is a key generation algorithm run by the PKG on input of a master
key mk and a user’s identity ID to return the user’s private key dID.
Encrypt: this probabilistic algorithm takes as input a plaintext M, a recipient’s
identity ID and the PKG’s public key Ppub to output a ciphertext C.
Decrypt: is a deterministic decryption algorithm that takes as input a cipher-
text C and the private decryption key dID to return a plaintext M or a
distinguished symbol ⊥ if C is not a valid ciphertext.
In sections 3 and 4, we shall use the above deﬁnition with the restriction that
the decryption algorithm never outputs a rejection message.

2.4 Security Notions
Deﬁnition 2. An identity based encryption scheme (IBE) is said to be adap-
tively chosen-ciphertext secure (IND-ID-CCA2) if no probabilistic polyno-
mial time (PPT) adversary has a non-negligible advantage in the following game.
vate key associated to it.
1. The challenger runs the Setup algorithm on input of a security parameter k
2. In a ﬁnd stage, A starts probing the following oracles:
and sends the domain-wide parameters to the cca-adversary A.
• Key extraction oracle: given an identity ID, it returns the extracted pri-
• Decryption oracle: given an identity ID ∈ {0, 1}∗ and a ciphertext C,
it generates the private key dID associated to ID and returns a plaintext
M ∈ M or (optionally, in schemes where ciphertexts may be invalid) a
distinguished symbol ⊥ indicating an ill-formed ciphertext.
A can present her queries adaptively in the sense that each query may depend
on the answer to previous ones.
3. A produces two equal-length plaintexts M0, M1 ∈ M and a target identity
ID∗
4. The challenger computes C = Encrypt(Mb, ID∗
), for a random hidden bit
b R← {0, 1}, which is sent to A.
5. In the guess stage, A asks new queries as in the ﬁnd stage but is restricted
not to issue a key extraction request on the target identity ID∗
and cannot
submit C to the decryption/veriﬁcation oracle for the identity ID∗
for which she has not corrupted the private key in stage 2.
.
6. A eventually outputs a bit b(cid:3) and wins if b(cid:3) = b.
A’s advantage is deﬁned as Adv(A) := |2 × P r[b(cid:3) = b] − 1|.
As the modiﬁcation of DHIES presented in [28], our hybrid modiﬁcation of the
Boneh-Franklin IBE [10] makes use of a symmetric cipher (i.e. a deterministic
length-preserving symmetric encryption scheme) that is chosen-ciphertext secure
in the ﬁnd-then-guess sense instead of one that only withstands passive attacks
as required by the Fujisaki-Okamoto transform [23].
Recall that a symmetric encryption scheme is a triple of algorithms SE =
(K, E, D). The key generation algorithm K generates a key k R← {0, 1}λ for a
security parameter λ. The encryption algorithm E takes a key k and a plaintext
m to produce a ciphertext c = E(k, m) while the decryption algorithm takes
a key k and a ciphertext c to return m/reject = D(k, c). In the deﬁnition of
chosen-ciphertext security for symmetric encryption schemes, the adversary can
query a decryption oracle D(k, .) as well as an encryption oracle E(k, .). We
recall below a security notion for ciphers that is considered in [32] and [28].
Deﬁnition 3. A symmetric cipher (E, D) is secure in the IND-CCA sense if
no PPT adversary A has a non negligible advantage in the following game:
1. The challenger chooses a key k R← {0, 1}λ.
2. A queries the encryption oracle E(k, .) and the decryption oracle D(k, .).
2. A outputs (m0, m1) that were not submitted to E(k, .) (which is determinis-
tic) or obtained from D(k, .) and gets c∗ = E(k, mb) for b R← {0, 1}.

of c∗ and the encryptions of m0 and m1.
3. A issues new queries1 as in step 2 but is disallowed to ask for the decryption
4. A eventually outputs a guess b(cid:3) for b.
As usual, her advantage is Advsym(A) := |2 × P r[b(cid:3) = b] − 1|.
The modes of operations CMC [25] and EME [26] are both length preserving
and they were shown to be secure in the sense of IND-CCA if the underlying
block cipher is a strong pseudo-random permutation.
3 A Modiﬁcation of the Boneh-Franklin IBE
This section presents a secure modiﬁcation of the Boneh-Franklin IBE that is
(almost) as eﬃcient as its basic version (that is only secure against chosen-
plaintext attacks and was called BasicIdent in [10]) while the original fully secure
version of IBE (that was called FullIdent) has computational and bandwidth
overheads induced by the application of the Fujisaki-Okamoto transform [23].
The new scheme, that we call Hybrid-IBE, produces shorter ciphertexts than the
original FullIdent while it is slightly more eﬃcient for the receiver who does not
have to compute a scalar multiplication in G1 upon decryption.
We have to mention that other transformations such as REACT [29] or GEM
[16] could be applied to BasicIdent or to some of its variants to turn them into
fully secure identity based encryption schemes without requiring the receiver to
Setup: given security parameters k and λ so that λ is polynomial in k, this algo-
rithm chooses a k-bit prime number q, groups G1, G2 of order q, a generator
P ∈ G1, a bilinear map e : G1 × G1 → G2, hash functions H1 : {0, 1}∗ → G1,
1 × G2 → {0, 1}λ, as well as a chosen-ciphertext secure cipher (E, D) of
H2 : G
keylength λ. It ﬁnally picks a master key mk := s R← Z
