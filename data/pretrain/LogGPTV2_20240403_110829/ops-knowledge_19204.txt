User:  Analyze the possible fault causes of the following phenomena, and give a solution source: not found error under ubuntu system
Assistant: Possible fault cause: The reason may be that the interpreter of the shell is not bash, and the interpreter of the shell needs to be changed to bash. Solution: Execute the ls -l /bin/sh command, if the result /bin/sh -> dash is obtained, it means that the shell interpreter is dash. You can execute the sudo ln -sf /bin/bash /bin/sh command to change the Shell interpreter to bash.
