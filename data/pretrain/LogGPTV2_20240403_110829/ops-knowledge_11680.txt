User: I'm on Windows 7 and if I type "python" in the command prompt as my regular user, I get the old, "'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file." but if I open the prompt as the administrator, python initiates like it should. 
The very first thing I did was edit the PATH variables through Control Panel, which seemed to add the environment variable, but there's a disconnect between doing this and cmd recognizing that I've done it. 
I have changed the permissions on the Python27 folder to allow full access to all users, I've tried adding a pythonexe variable and add that to the PATH, as another StackOverflow question suggested. 
When I type PATH = C:\Python27 into cmd as a regular user, that also wont work. 
and if I type in set PATH, "C:\Python27;" is in the returned line. 
I'm fairly certain it's a permission problem, which is the only reason I've re-posted my own version of this age old question. How do I run Python, given this error and these circumstances?
Assistant: So, one of the things I noticed when I had that problem is that the USERNAME environment variable was only set to system which is the administrator environment variable. I simply looked up the username in the regular command prompt, using echo %USERNAME% and appended a semicolon and the username to the %USERNAME& environment variable. That fixed the issue. Everything you can do in the administrator is now able to be done in the regular user command line as well.
