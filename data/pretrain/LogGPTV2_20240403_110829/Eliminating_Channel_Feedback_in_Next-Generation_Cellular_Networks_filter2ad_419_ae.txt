functions plotted in Fig. 3 (c), start to become narrower and
thus, two sincs for different paths do not impact each other.
This would lead to the AoA power proﬁles in Fig. 3 (d) to
look identical at different frequencies and hence, improve
the performance of this approach.
Since we have a 5 antenna base station, we are unable to
test this hypothesis empirically. However, we test this hy-
pothesis using a simulation. We simulate a wireless testbed
of size 200 m × 200 m. Channels are modeled using equa-
tion the standard wireless propagation model (Eqn. 2 [47]).
The signals from the base station to the client and vice-versa
travel through the direct line of sight path and also after re-
ﬂecting off up to 10 different obstacles along the way. The
positions of the reﬂectors are randomly selected and so is
the attenuation faced by each path. The number of antennas
on the base station is varied from 4 to 16 in steps of 4. The
frequency of operation is 650 MHz (uplink) and 680 MHz
(downlink), as used in the rest of the results. Random addi-
tive white Gaussian noise is added in order to vary the SNR.
We plot the variation of the SNR gains achieved by dif-
ferent systems in Fig. 10(c). As the number of antennas in-
creases, the ideal beamforming gain with the true channels
increases as 20log(N) on average, where N is the number
of antennas. R2-F2 keeps up with this increase in gain, as
the number of antennas increases and stays within 1 dB of
the ideal gain. With more antennas, R2-F2 has more infor-
mation to estimate the path parameters underlying the wire-
less channels and hence, improves its estimates. On the other
hand, the AoA proﬁle based approach can only achieve half
of the gain achieved by the beamforming with the true chan-
nel information, even as the number of antennas is increased
to 16. This is because of two main reasons: a) as the num-
ber of antennas increases, the directionality of the antenna
array increases and hence, a better estimation of channels is
required to maintain the ideal gain and b) even if the sincs
become narrower, as is expected, with increasing number of
antennas, the phase of each of the sincs is still frequency
dependent. When these sincs combine to give the channels,
these phase add errors in the channel estimates.
To conclude, this simulation provides two interesting in-
sights. First, R2-F2 maintains its performance even as the
number of antennas is increased. Second, it does not sufﬁce
to use AoA power proﬁles to infer wireless channels at the
target frequency. One needs to go further and separate the in-
dividual paths and their phases to achieve accurate channel
inference, as done by R2-F2.
9. CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this paper, we present, R2-F2 a system that uses wire-
less channel measurements on one frequency band to infer
channels on a different frequency band. By doing so, R2-F2
enables multi-antenna techniques to be used in LTE systems
with zero feedback from the client. R2-F2’s performance was
demonstrated empiricaly with uplink and downlink channels
separated by 20-30 MHz, as in the majority of LTE deploy-
ments in United States [49]. Beyond LTE, our work has im-
plications on the general concept of reciprocity across fre-
quency bands, for other wireless technologies such as wire-
less LANs and whitespace networks. However, we note that
the relatively small separation of uplink and downlink fre-
quencies in LTE ensures that reﬂection properties of ob-
jects in the environment and the divergence between physical
propagation characteristics is limited. We believe extending
the results presented by us to technologies that require sig-
niﬁcantly larger frequency separations is non-trivial and falls
in the realm of future work.
