### Functions and Sinc Function Behavior

As illustrated in Fig. 3(c), the functions start to become narrower, resulting in minimal interaction between sinc functions representing different paths. This leads to the Angle of Arrival (AoA) power profiles in Fig. 3(d) appearing identical at different frequencies, thereby enhancing the performance of this approach.

### Simulation Setup

Given our base station with 5 antennas, empirical testing of this hypothesis is not feasible. Instead, we conducted a simulation to test it. The simulation environment was a 200 m × 200 m wireless testbed. Channels were modeled using the standard wireless propagation model (Eqn. 2 [47]). Signals from the base station to the client and vice versa travel through both the direct line of sight path and after reflecting off up to 10 randomly positioned obstacles. The attenuation for each path was also randomly assigned. The number of antennas on the base station was varied from 4 to 16 in increments of 4. The operating frequencies were 650 MHz (uplink) and 680 MHz (downlink), consistent with the rest of the results. Random additive white Gaussian noise was added to vary the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).

### Results and Analysis

The SNR gains achieved by different systems are plotted in Fig. 10(c). As the number of antennas increases, the ideal beamforming gain with true channel information increases by approximately \(20 \log(N)\) dB on average, where \(N\) is the number of antennas. R2-F2 maintains this increase in gain, staying within 1 dB of the ideal gain. With more antennas, R2-F2 has more information to estimate the underlying path parameters, thus improving its estimates. In contrast, the AoA profile-based approach only achieves half the gain of beamforming with true channel information, even when the number of antennas is increased to 16. This is due to two main reasons:
1. Increased directionality of the antenna array as the number of antennas grows, requiring better channel estimation to maintain ideal gain.
2. Even though the sinc functions become narrower with more antennas, their phase remains frequency-dependent, introducing errors in channel estimates when combined.

### Conclusions

This simulation provides two key insights:
1. R2-F2 maintains its performance as the number of antennas increases.
2. Using AoA power profiles alone is insufficient for accurate channel inference at the target frequency. It is necessary to separate individual paths and their phases, as done by R2-F2, to achieve accurate channel inference.

### Concluding Remarks

In this paper, we present R2-F2, a system that leverages wireless channel measurements on one frequency band to infer channels on a different frequency band. This enables multi-antenna techniques in LTE systems without requiring feedback from the client. R2-F2's performance was empirically demonstrated with uplink and downlink channels separated by 20-30 MHz, as is common in most LTE deployments in the United States [49]. Beyond LTE, our work has implications for the general concept of reciprocity across frequency bands in other wireless technologies such as wireless LANs and whitespace networks. However, the relatively small separation of uplink and downlink frequencies in LTE ensures that the reflection properties of objects in the environment and the divergence between physical propagation characteristics are limited. Extending these results to technologies requiring significantly larger frequency separations is non-trivial and is an area for future work.
