User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How can I get Transaction Logs to auto-truncate after Backup Setup: Sql Server 2008 R2, databases set up with Full recovery mode. 

I have set up a maintenance plan that backs up the transaction logs for a number of databases on the server. It is set to create backup files in sub-directories for each database, verify backup integrity is turned on, and backup compression is used. The job is set to run once every 2 hours during business hours (8am-6pm). 

I have tested the job and it runs fine, creates the log backup files as it should. However, from what I have read, once the transaction log is backed up, it should be ok to truncate the transaction log. I do not see any option for doing this in the Sql Server Maintenance Plan designer. How can I set this up?

Assistant: Strictly speaking, the log backup is truncating the portion of the log that's just been backed up. However, truncating the log simply marks the log entries for reuse - it doesn't imply that the physical log file will shrink. That would be a separate (manual) step, and really, if your log files needed to grow to that size in the first place, then repeatedly shrinking/growing them will only add to fragmentation and hurt performance.

Summary: If you're doing regular log backups, then you don't need to worry about manually truncating the logs (and if you do it manually anyway, you'll ruin your log backup chain).
