**ATT&CK ID:** M1026  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Privileged Account Management

**Description:**
To enhance security, restrict the permissions of domain administrator accounts to domain controllers and a limited set of servers. Delegate other administrative functions to separate, dedicated accounts with the minimum necessary privileges. This practice helps to minimize the potential impact of a compromised account and reduces the attack surface.
