User: How to deploy and manage containerized applications? Please provide a common container management tool and how to use it.
Assistant: One common container management tool is Kubernetes. To deploy and manage containerized applications using Kubernetes, the usual steps are as follows: 1. Create a Kubernetes cluster. The cluster contains Master nodes and Worker nodes. The Master node is responsible for managing the Worker nodes, and is also the scheduler and control node. Worker nodes are responsible for running containers and implementing business logic. 2. Define a Deployment in Kubernetes. Deployment is an object used to describe information about containerized applications, such as container images, number of Pods, container ports, etc. Define the number of Pods to run in the Deployment, and the Kubectl command will create these Pods. 3. Deploy the Deployment to the Kubernetes cluster. Deployment can be done through the Kubectl command line tool, for example: kubectl create -f <filename.yaml> 4. Use Kubernetes to manage containerized applications. Management operations include: scaling the number of Pods, upgrading/rolling back container images, log monitoring and troubleshooting, etc. You can use the Kubectl command line tool or management tools such as Kubernetes Dashboard to complete the above operations. To sum up, to deploy and manage containerized applications using Kubernetes, the core concepts that need to be mastered include: Pod, Deployment, Service, etc. At the same time, you need to master how to use the Kubectl command line tool, understand the core components of Kubernetes such as API Server, Etcd, Controller Manager, and Scheduler, and how to use Kubernetes for capacity expansion and fault recovery.
