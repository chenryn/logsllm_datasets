    8. Examine Amazon VPC Flow Logs and AWS WAF logs for any anomalous network activity.
8. If you are *aware* of the AWS resources involved:
    1. Consider the following steps to identify suspicious activity or unauthorized access in Amazon S3:
        1. [Review Amazon Macie policy findings related to your S3 data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/macie/latest/user/findings-types.html#findings-policy-types)
        2. [Analyze S3 protection in Amazon GuardDuty](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/s3-protection.html) 
    2. For unintended access to an Amazon S3 bucket refer to [this incident response playbook.](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-incident-response-playbooks/blob/master/playbooks/IRP-DataAccess.md)
9. As previously stated, you maintaining a clear chain of custody is crucial in ensuring the immutability of all evidence. Some of the techniques are mentioned in blog post - [Forensic investigation environment strategies in the AWS Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/forensic-investigation-environment-strategies-in-the-aws-cloud/). In summary, here are the techniques:
    1. Snapshots of Amazon EBS disks: The original EBS disks can be snapshotted, shared to a forensics account, converted into a volume, and mounted in read-only mode for offline analysis.
    2. Manually captured Amazon EBS volumes: Linux tools such as dc3dd can be used to stream the volume to an S3 bucket, along with a hash, and made immutable using an S3 method.
    3. Artifacts stored in an S3 bucket, such as memory dumps: Object Lock in S3 can prevent deletion or overwriting of objects for a specified duration or permanently. MFA delete requires multi-factor authentication to delete an object permanently. Glacier provides a Vault Lock feature to retain evidence in an immutable state over the long term.
    4. Disk volumes: Read-only mode can be used for Linux and write-blocker applications for Windows, some of which are specifically designed for forensic use.
    5. CloudTrail logs: Log file integrity can be validated using CloudTrail's SHA-256 hash and SHA-256 with RSA signing. S3 Object Lock - Governance Mode can be used for protection.
    6. AWS Systems Manager inventory: By default, metadata on managed instances is stored in an S3 bucket and can be secured using the above methods.
    7. AWS Config data: Data stored by AWS Config in an S3 bucket can also be protected through the aforementioned methods.
10. Check if there are any open support tickets for the data storage service, and search for connections with any alerts or information related to the incident. Note any perceived effects on end-users, which may encompass but are not limited to:
    1. Missing data from the storage service
    2. Unexpected presence of new data in the storage service
    3. Changes in access settings (such as permissions) of data, especially if they have been made public
    4. Modified data storage service permissions, access controls, or settings that prevent public access (these may be less noticeable to regular users, but still a possibility)
11. The following are recommendations for internal and external communication regarding a data breach incident, however they may vary based on legal requirements. This example is based on an organization governed by GDPR regulations.
    1. For internal communication, it is important to quickly gather relevant information and assess the scope and impact of the breach. This information should then be shared with the incident response team and relevant stakeholders within the organization. Regular updates should be provided throughout the investigation process to keep everyone informed.
    2. For external communication, it is important to consider the privacy rights of individuals whose PII may have been compromised, as well as the organization's obligations under the GDPR or other relevant legislation/protocols for your jurisdiction. In general, organizations are required to report data breaches to relevant authorities within 72 hours and to notify affected individuals without undue delay. 
### Part 2: Contain the Incident
Early identification of unusual actions taken by users or strange network activity is crucial in minimizing the harm caused by incidents involving a PII data breach. To prevent the situation from worsening, it's important to take steps to contain the incident, as well as collaborating with your organization's legal and compliance team on any necessary responses and following the incident response plan outlined. Here are a few examples of containment actions for specific AWS services:
1. In this scenario, PII data breach was in an Amazon S3 bucket. Here are the steps you can take to contain the incident:
    1. Identify IAM identities with access to AWS resources
        1. The first step in the process is to identify the IAM identities (which can be either human users or non-human roles) that have access to the AWS resources in question. This is important because it helps to determine the scope of the breach and the extent to which sensitive data has been compromised. Based on this information, you can then take appropriate actions to mitigate the impact of the breach.
    2. Remove access granting policy for the specific IAM role or user
        1. In order to revoke S3 access from an IAM role or user, you need to navigate to the specific S3 bucket where the data breach has occurred. This is where the sensitive data was stored and where unauthorized access occurred.
        2. Once you have navigated to the specific S3 bucket, you need to click on the "Permissions" tab. From there, select the "Bucket Policy" option.
        3. The next step is to remove the access granting policy for the specific IAM role or user.  Here is a example policy on how to [Managing user access to specific folders.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-bucket-policies.html#example-bucket-policies-folders)This will effectively revoke the access of the IAM role or user to the S3 bucket, preventing further unauthorized access to the sensitive data
2. In this scenario, external vendor accounts have been accessing PII stored in DynamoDB tables through SQS and AWS Lambda. The PII data is encrypted using a KMS key at rest and in transit by application, however, due to a defect in the application, some of the PII information may not have been encrypted properly in transit. To contain this PII data breach, you can take the following actions: 
    1. Please evaluate the potential business impact of limiting or revoking vendor access to the DynamoDB table, if applicable.
    2. If it is acceptable to revoke the access of the vendor, you can do so by updating the access policy to remove their permissions to access the impacted DynamoDB tables and the corresponding SQS queue. This will help to prevent any unauthorized access or use of the resources, which will limit the potential impact of the security breach.
    3. Remove the PII data from the logs of the Lambda function that consumes SQS messages. This helps prevent the sensitive information from being further disclosed or compromised. By using Amazon Comprehend and a Lambda function, you can automatically detect and redact PII data in your S3 objects. Following  is a tutorial on explaing how this can be accomplished:
        1. [Tutorial: Detecting and redacting PII data with S3 Object Lambda and Amazon Comprehend](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/tutorial-s3-object-lambda-redact-pii.html)
        2. [Sample project to demonstrate how to use AWS SDK for Amazon Comprehend to detect and redact PII data from logs generated by Java applications](https://github.com/aws-samples/comprehend-logging-redact)
    4. Conduct a table scan to identify all the rows with unencrypted PII data and update/delete columns. 
### Part 3: Eradicate the Incident
First step is to determine the affected resources using log data, resources, and automated tooling and then assess each affected resource to determine the business impact of deletion or restoration. Below is an example of eradication steps that can be taken for a personal data exposure that happened due to wide open security group:
1. Identify the potential immediate cause or causes for the PII exposure at hand:
    1. Analyze the collected log data, resources, and tooling to determine the source of the exposure.
    2. Identify if the cause, and then work back through the “5 whys” to get to the root cause https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/why-you-should-develop-a-correction-of-error-coe/.
2. It may be helpful to review the infrastructure deployment pipelines, such as those implemented with CloudFormation via AWS Code Pipeline or Terraform, and the data pipelines to determine which mechanism led to the misconfiguration or misclassification of data injection mechanisms. Are there enough checks and balances in the pipeline? If not, it may be necessary to address this issue.
3. If there are any specific issues that have been identified, take steps to remove any resources or configurations that were identified as the immediate causes. For example:
    1. If the cause is a misconfigured security group, adjust the security group rules to prevent unauthorized access.
    2. If the cause is an unauthorized user, revoke their access to the affected resources.
    3. If the cause is a vulnerability, apply patches or upgrades to fix it.
    4. There may be other causes, take the appropriate action. 
4. Clean up the environment:
    1. Delete any PII data that may have been exposed.
    2. If PII data must be kept, encrypt it to prevent unauthorized access.
5. Restore normal operations:
    1. Restore permissions and access for authorized users.
    2. Reconnect systems or resources to the network.
### Part 4: Recover from the Incident
In addition to restoring the service to a stable and reliable state, it is crucial to inform and provide clear guidance to affected users. Here are the steps you can follow:
1. Coordinate with PR and Legal teams:
    1. Work with your organization's public relations and legal teams to determine the most appropriate approach for communicating with affected users.
1. Update FAQ and Help Center pages:
    1. Utilize your organization's FAQ and Help Center web pages to provide clear and concise information to affected users.
    1. Ensure that the FAQ and Help Center web page are updated regularly with the latest information regarding the incident, including any measures that users can take to safeguard themselves. Here are some sample guidelines that you can provide to your affected external customers in case of identity theft via your application:
        1. *Verify the breach*: Confirm that your personal information has been exposed in the data breach by checking our help centre website. 
        2. *Secure your accounts*: Change passwords for any accounts that use the breached information, such as email and financial accounts, and enable two-factor authentication.
        3. *Monitor your accounts*: Regularly monitor your accounts associated with the breached information for any unauthorized activities.
        4. *Place a fraud alert*: Consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report to alert lenders and banks to check with you before opening new accounts.
        5. *Consider credit monitoring:* Consider enrolling in a credit monitoring service to receive alerts about any changes or suspicious activity on your credit report.
        6. *Report the breach*: Report the data breach to relevant government agencies if applicable. 
        7. *Stay vigilant*: Be mindful of phishing scams and other attempts to steal your information, and take steps to protect your information going forward.
1. Provide timely information:
    1. Make sure that information is updated in a timely manner to keep affected users informed of the latest developments.
    2. Ensure that the information provided is accurate and easy to understand.
By taking these steps, you can help affected users to stay informed and feel confident that their information and interests are being protected during an incident.
### Part 5: Post-Incident Activity
>**Note**
>
> It is important to contact legal counsel **early** to determine if public and individual communication needs to be initiated. Legal counsel can provide guidance on the specific legal requirements and obligations associated with the notification of personal data breaches, including any applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards.
Once you have removed the affected resources, it's recommended that you perform a security assessment of your AWS account. This assessment can be accomplished by utilizing AWS Config rules, open-source tools like Prowler and ScoutSuite, or other providers. Furthermore, we suggest conducting vulnerability scans on your publicly accessible resources to identify any lingering risks.
In the aftermath of a personal data breach, it is critical to conduct a comprehensive post-incident review to identify areas for improvement and prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. The following post-incident activities can be performed in accordance with the correction of error (COE) concept that is discussed in the following links:
[Why you should develop a correction of error (COE)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/why-you-should-develop-a-correction-of-error-coe/)
[Correction of Error (COE)](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.coe.en.html)
1. Review the incident: Perform a thorough review of the incident, including the causes, severity, and impact. This information will be used to determine the effectiveness of the incident response plan and identify areas for improvement.
2. Document lessons learned: Document lessons learned from the incident and use this information to update the incident response plan. This information should include details about the attack vector, the methods used by the attacker, and any other relevant information.
3. Update the incident response plan: Based on the lessons learned, update the incident response plan to reflect any changes or improvements that should be made to the incident response process.
4. Perform a root cause analysis: Conduct a root cause analysis to determine the underlying causes of the incident and to identify any additional areas for improvement.
5. Update policies and procedures: Based on the results of the root cause analysis, update policies and procedures to ensure that the incident response plan is aligned with best practices and regulatory requirements.
6. Implement corrective actions: Implement any necessary corrective actions to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.
