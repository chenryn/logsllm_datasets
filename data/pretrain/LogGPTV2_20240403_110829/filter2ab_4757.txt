### Title: Blackhat EU-19: Mobile Network Hacking, IP Edition

Over the past decade, mobile networks have seen significant security enhancements, including improved GSM encryption, stronger SIM card protections, and more robust SS7 configurations. These advancements have been largely driven by research presented at hacking conferences like this one.

However, as mobile networks have evolved, they have also become increasingly complex, integrating a wide array of IT technologies such as SIP, WiFi, IPSec, and, most notably, web technologies. This integration has introduced new vulnerabilities and security challenges.

In this talk, we will highlight the security shortcomings that arise from merging IT protocols into mobile networks. We will revisit and demonstrate how previously mitigated hacking techniques, such as IMSI catchers for intercepting mobile identities, remote SMS interception, and universal caller ID spoofing, can still be exploited in modern mobile networks.

We will also examine the current gaps in protection measures within mobile networks and discuss how to effectively implement best practices from the IT security domain to enhance the overall security of mobile networks.
