We should be able to get away with using umbrellas and not individual libs to
link.
This represents shaking the tree to get rid of the duplication.
That is, I think we can get away with just using one of these:
  1. windowsapp.lib
  2. onecoreuap.lib
  3. onecoreuap_apiset.lib
  4. onecore.lib
  5. onecore_apiset.lib
and none of things like this:
  * kernel32.lib
  * gdi32.lib
  * user32.lib  
etc.
This represents someone groveling around `common.build.post.props` and friends
and shaking them out.
