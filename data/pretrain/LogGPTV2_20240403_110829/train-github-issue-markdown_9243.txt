Right now it's "firebase_storage" instead of
"plugins.flutter.io/firebase_storage"
I think we should also rename `FirebaseStorage._channel` to
`FirebaseStorage.channel` and mark it `@visibleForTesting` so it can only be
used in tests, like we do for firebase_auth. Then we wouldn't need to
duplicate the channel name in tests.
