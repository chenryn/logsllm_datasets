### Preface
This story takes place from January to April 2013, before the PRISM/NSA spying scandal. Daniel was serving his first term as a freshman legislator, focusing on privacy legislation, while Eric worked behind the scenes to formulate the legislation. Daniel is planning to run for the 2015 Montana legislature.

### Need for Privacy Laws
The goal is to create legislation that enforces Montana’s constitutional right to privacy:

**"RIGHT OF PRIVACY. The right of individual privacy is essential to the well-being of a free society and shall not be infringed without the showing of a compelling state interest."**

Rights and liberties are meaningless without laws that clearly protect them.

### Policy Frameworks
The proposed Montana law is based on existing frameworks:
- California's Civil Code 1798.14-1798.23
- Massachusetts' 201 CMR 17.00
- EU’s Privacy Directive
- Germany’s Data Privacy Laws (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz or BDSG)

#### Key Provisions of Existing Frameworks:
- **California's Civil Code 1798.14-1798.23:**
  - "Each agency shall maintain in its records only personal information which is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency..."
- **Massachusetts' 201 CMR 17.00:**
  - Section 2: Regulations to safeguard personal information of commonwealth residents.
  - Section 3: Duty to report known security breaches or unauthorized use of personal information.
- **Germany’s Data Privacy Laws:**
  - Prevents organizations from collecting personally identifiable information without obtaining permission.
  - Permissions must be specific, including how, where, how long, and for what purposes the data will be used.
  - Individuals may revoke permissions at any time.
  - Organizations must implement policies, procedures, and controls to protect all data.

### Creation Process
- The bill was initially compiled from external sources and introduced in the previous legislative session.
- We refined the bill by adding explanations, definitions, and clarifications.
- The updated bill was submitted to legislative services and then proposed to the House.

### HB400 in Depth
**Main Points of HB 400:**
1. Data subjects must be notified when their personal information is being collected.
2. Personal information may be used only for the stated purpose and not for any other purposes.
3. Personal information may not be collected or disclosed without the data subject's consent.
4. Collected personal information must be kept secure from potential abuses.
5. Data subjects must be informed about who is collecting their personal information.
6. Data subjects must have access to their personal information and the ability to correct inaccurate data.
7. Data subjects must have a method to hold data collectors accountable for following these principles.

### First Bill Draft - Document Issues
- **Definitions:** 
  - Almost 30 definitions, including "Agency," "Blocking," "Business," "Collection," "Communication," "Consent," "Controller," "Customer," "Data subject," "Disclose," "Entity," "Erasure," "Governmental entity," "Individual," "Maintain," "Mobile telecommunications services," "Modification," "Person," "Personal information," "Processing," "Processor," "Record," "Storage," "System of records," "Third party," "Use."
  - Phrases like "Data Subject" were hard to differentiate from "Customer" and "Individual."
  - Defining "Personal Data" was challenging.
- **Overreaching Clauses:**
  - A business may not refuse to conduct commerce with an individual solely because they refuse to consent to the collection, processing, or use of their personal information, except when genuinely needed for the service, product, financial transaction, or legal compliance.

### Small Business Burden
- Can small businesses comply?
- Could this create another burdensome regulation on small businesses, making it harder to compete?
- Should small businesses collect information if they can't safely store it?

### First Bill Draft - People Issues
- **Leadership Issues:**
  - Conservative leadership promised the bill would go to the Judiciary committee, which focuses on rights and liberties.
  - Leadership was not concerned about privacy legislation and didn't fully understand it.
  - The bill ended up in the Business and Labor committee to be killed.
- **Push Back from Lobbyists:**
  - Some representatives voted according to lobbyist preferences without questioning intentions.
  - Lobbyists claimed concern over regulation but were worried about losing the ability to profit from consumer information.
  - Daniel earned the nickname "Mad Russian" due to his low tolerance for lobbyists.
- **Understandability Problems:**
  - Partially a generational issue; younger representatives understood the bill better than older ones.
  - Lack of awareness (no longer an issue).
- **Bill Sizing Issues:**
  - The bill was 26 pages long, complex, and interacted with multiple state laws.
  - It proposed many new ideas and paradigms in one document.

### The Committee Meeting
- **Proponent Testimonies:**
  - ACLU and Eric Fulton
- **Opponent Testimonies:**
  - MT Retail Association, MT Telecommunications Association, Multiple Insurance Companies, MT Auto Dealers Association, MT Bankers Association, Multiple Hospitals, Chamber of Commerce, MT Collectors Association, MT Data Association
- **Committee Members:**
  - Unengaged and largely unsupportive.

### Tabled in Committee
- **Reasons for Tabling:**
  - Wrong committee assignment.
  - Nearly all lobbyists opposed privacy legislation due to special interests.
  - The bill was large and complex.
  - Most legislators did not understand the need for such legislation.
  - Many saw HB400 as growing government and creating unnecessary laws.

### The Demise of HB400 - Death By Committee
- **Factors Contributing to Failure:**
  - HB400 tried to achieve too much.
  - Privacy issues did not directly affect people at the time.
  - We did not compromise with opposing interests.
  - We were new to the process and missed informal formalities.
  - Lack of funding for awareness.
  - No motivating story.

### Unexpected Consequences/Results
- **Passed Cell Phone Privacy Bill:**
  - Required law enforcement to obtain a search warrant before collecting location information from electronic devices.
  - Short and simple, only one page.
  - Included emergency opt-outs.
  - Considered a "common sense" bill.

### Revising Our Legislative Strategy
- **Break HB400 into smaller, more digestible pieces.**
- **Create clear cases for each new bill.**
- **Work with businesses to ensure they understand our goals and we understand their challenges.**

### Privacy Legislation Goals
- **Implement the 7 core points of HB400:**
  1. Data subjects must be notified when their personal information is being collected.
  2. Personal information may be used only for the stated purpose.
  3. Personal information may not be collected or disclosed without the data subject's consent.
  4. Collected personal information must be kept secure.
  5. Data subjects must be informed about who is collecting their personal information.
  6. Data subjects must have access to their personal information and the ability to correct inaccuracies.
  7. Data subjects must have a method to hold data collectors accountable.

### Privacy Legislation Goals - 2015
- **Priority: Pass the Consent Section:**
  - Personal information may be collected, processed, or used by an entity only if the data subject has consented or if any other legal provision explicitly permits or allows an activity without the need for consent.
  - Consent implies ownership of private information and is a critical step.

### Conclusion
- **Model Privacy Legislation:**
  - Protect states' rights.
  - Set a legal precedent for privacy.
  - Ensure George Orwell was a dreamer and not a predictor.
