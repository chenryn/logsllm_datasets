Preface
Entire story takes place January - April 2013, 
before PRISM/NSA spying fiasco
Daniel was serving his first term as a freshman 
legislator, focusing on privacy legislation.Eric 
worked behind the scenes formulating the 
legislation.
Daniel will be running for the 2015 Montana 
legislature. 
Need For Privacy Laws
Create legislation to enforce Montana’s 
constitutional right to privacy
“RIGHT OF PRIVACY. The right of individual 
privacy is essential to the well-being of a free 
society and shall not be infringed without the 
showing of a compelling state interest.”
Sadly, rights and liberties have no meaning 
without laws clearly protecting them.
Policy Frameworks
Base proposed Montana law on existing 
frameworks
● California's Civil Code 1798.14-1798.23
● Massachusetts' 201 CMR 17.00
● EU’s Privacy Directive
● Germany’s Data Privacy Laws 
(Bundesdatenschutzgesetz or BDSG)
California's Civil Code 1798.14-
1798.23
“Each agency shall maintain in its records only 
personal information which is relevant and 
necessary to accomplish a purpose of the 
agency...”
Massachusetts' 201 CMR 17.00
Section 2 - Regulations to safeguard personal 
information of commonwealth residents
Section 3 - Duty to report known security 
breach or unauthorized use of personal 
information
Germany’s Data Privacy Laws
● Prevents organizations from collecting any 
personally identifiable information without 
obtaining permission from an individual
● Permission for the collection of data must be 
specific including how, where, how long and 
for what purposes the data will be used.
● Individuals may revoke permissions at any 
time. 
● Policies, procedures, controls must be put in 
place by the organization to protect all data.
Creation Process
● Our Bill was originally put together from 
outside sources and tried the previous 
session. 
● Polished the previous bill, added additional 
explanations, definitions, and clarifications.
● Handed updated bill to legislative services
● Proposed bill to House
HB400 in Depth
Main Points of HB 400
     (1) data subjects must be given notice when 
their personal information is being collected;
     (2) personal information may be used only 
for the purpose stated and not for any other 
purposes;
     (3) personal information may not be 
collected or disclosed without the data subject's 
consent;
Main Points of HB 400 (continued)
     (4) personal information that is collected must 
be kept secure from any potential abuses;
     (5) data subjects must be informed as to who is 
collecting personal information;
     (6) data subjects must be allowed to access 
their personal information and make corrections to 
any inaccurate data; and
     (7) data subjects must have a method available 
to them to hold data collectors accountable for 
following the principles contained in this section.
First Bill Draft - Document Issues
Definitions 
Opt Outs and Extenuating Circumstances
Created paperwork issues for small businesses
Definition Issues
Almost 30 definitions 
"Agency", "Blocking", "Business", "Collection", "Communication", "Consent", "Controller", "Customer", 
"Data subject", "Disclose", "Entity", "Erasure", "Governmental entity", "Individual", "Maintain", "Mobile 
telecommunications services", "Modification", "Person", "Personal information", "Processing", 
"Processor", "Record", "Storage", "System of records", "Third party", "Use"
Phrases like "Data Subject" are hard to 
differentiate from "Customer" and "Individual"
How to define "Personal Data"
Overreaching Clauses
"A business may not refrain from conducting 
commerce with an individual solely because the 
individual refuses to consent to the business's 
collection, processing, or use of the individual's 
personal information except when the personal 
information is genuinely needed for the 
business to provide the service or product 
requested, to complete a financial transaction, 
or to comply with the law".
Small Business Burden
Can small businesses comply? 
Could this create another burdensome 
regulation on small businesses that make it 
harder to compete? 
Should mom and pop shops be collecting 
information if they can't safely store it?
First Bill Draft - People Issues
● Leadership issues
● Extensive push back from lobbyists
● “Too Long” (at 26 pages)
● People didn't understand it / read it
Leadership Issues
● Conservative leadership promised the bill 
would end up in the Judiciary committee. 
● Judiciary committee focuses on rights and 
liberties. For example, gun bills, gay rights 
and abortion bills. 
● Leadership was not concerned about privacy 
legislation and didn't fully understand it. 
● The bill ended up in Business and Labor to 
be killed. 
HB 400
37 Signatures, 
mostly from 
members of the 
House and Senate 
appropriations 
committee. 
Push Back From Lobbyists
● Some Representatives serve as easy votes 
to their sponsors, the lobbyists and took their 
side without ever questioning intentions.  
● Lobbyists said they were concerned about 
more regulation. In truth, they were 
concerned about possibly losing the ability to 
profit from consumer information. 
● I obtained a reputation rather quick with my 
low tolerance for lobbyists.. Was referred to 
as the "Mad Russian". 
Understandability Problems
● Partially a generational problem. 
● Young Democrats and Republicans worked 
together. Older Representatives barely knew 
what facebook was. 
● Lack of awareness (not any more)
Bill Sizing Issues
The bill: 
● Was 26 pages long.  This is big by MT 
Standards
● Complex. It interacted with a number of 
other state laws increasing reading 
complexity.
● Proposed a lot of new ideas and paradigms 
in one document.
The Committee Meeting
● Two Proponent Testimonies, ACLU and Eric
● A line of Opponents: MT Retail Association, 
MT Telecommunications Association, 
Multiple Insurance companies, MT Auto 
Dealers Association, MT Bankers 
Association, Multiple Hospitals, Chamber of 
Commerce, MT Collectors Association, MT 
Data Association
● Unengaged Committee Members
Tabled in Committee
● Wrong committee in the first place
● Nearly all of the lobbyists were not supportive of 
any type of privacy legislation. Special interests 
profit from this data
● The bill was large.
● Most legislators didn't understand the premise on 
why we needed this legislation. 
● Many legislators saw HB400 as growing 
government and creating unnecessary laws.
The Demise of HB400 -
Death By Committee
● HB400 tried too much
● Privacy (currently) didn’t affect people 
DIRECTLY. We were two or three months 
ahead of our time.
● We didn't compromise with opposing 
interests. 
The Demise of HB400 - 
Additional Thoughts
● We are new to the process.  There were a 
lot of informal formalities we didn’t realize 
had to be done
● Lack of $$$ for awareness
● No motivating story
Unexpected Consequences/Results
A Privacy Bill Was Passed 
Through...
Cell Phone privacy
● Required law enforcement to obtain a search 
warrant before being able to collect location 
information from electronic devices.
● It was short and simple. Only 1 page.
● It had emergency opt-outs 
● It was a “common sense” bill
Revising Our Legislative Strategy
● Break HB400 into smaller, more digestible 
pieces
● Create clear cases for each new bill
● Work with businesses to ensure they 
understand our goals, and we understand 
their hardships
Privacy Legislation Goals
Implement the 7 core points of HB400:
     (1) data subjects must be given notice when their personal information is 
being collected;
     (2) personal information may be used only for the purpose stated and not for 
any other purposes;
     (3) personal information may not be collected or disclosed without the data 
subject's consent;
    (4) personal information that is collected must be kept secure from any 
potential abuses;
     (5) data subjects must be informed as to who is collecting personal 
information;
     (6) data subjects must be allowed to access their personal information and 
make corrections to any inaccurate data; and
     (7) data subjects must have a method available to them to hold data 
collectors accountable for following the principles contained in this section.
Privacy Legislation Goals - 2015
We need to have the consent section passed:
Consent. (1) Personal information may be collected, processed, or used by an 
entity only if the data subject has consented or any other legal provision 
explicitly permits or allows an activity without the need for consent.
Consent implies ownership of private 
information. This section is also relatively 
simple and the most important step that can be 
taken. 
It all leads to...
Model privacy legislation
States rights
Setting a legal precedent for privacy
Ensuring Orwell was a dreamer and not a 
predictor
