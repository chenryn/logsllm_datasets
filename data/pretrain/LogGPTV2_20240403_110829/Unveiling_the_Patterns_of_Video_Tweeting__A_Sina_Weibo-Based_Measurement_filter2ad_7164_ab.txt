Fig. 6. Distribution of mobile clients
The retweet or the comment of a tweet also contains the device type of a Weibo
user. Thus, we are able to know which devices Weibo users are commonly using
to watch tweeted videos. Fig. 5 shows that 32% of viewers use mobile devices
to watch videos, and the left 68% use personal computers. We further plot the
distribution of mobile clients in Fig. 6, which shows that among all the mobile
clients, iPhones and Android phones account for 32.7% and 34.2% respectively.
For other devices, iPads, Android Pads, and Symbian devices account for 8%,
1.8%, and 10% respectively. The percentage of Windows Phones is less than
0.1%. In addition, there are 12% devices with unknown types. As the number of
mobile users continues to increase, P2P-based solution may not be a practical
approach considering the limited battery and bandwidth of mobile clients. In
addition, due to the diversity of mobile clients (e.g., diﬀerent screen sizes, video
codec, etc), the video service provider should provide multiple versions of a video
so as to be compatible with diﬀerent devices.

ular videos

video tweet and its n-th view
For a Weibo user, we use the timestamp embedded in a retweet or comment
to approximate the viewing time of a video. Such approximation is feasible as
most Weibo users prefer to retweet/comment a video right after viewing the
video. In Fig. 7, we show the evolution of the number of views (approximated
by the sum of retweets and comments) for the top 5 popular videos in our
dataset. Note that the number of views shown in Fig. 7 is only a lower bound
of the actual number of views. In Fig. 7, we can clearly observe the occurrence
of ﬂash crowds. For Video 1, the number of views can suddenly increase to
nearly 20,000 within one hour. Such ﬂash crowds are possibly induced by a
social star’s retweet/comment, or the Weibo system’s recommendation. Due to
the huge number of followers (e.g., the top 1 social star in Weibo, Chen Yao,
has 24 million followers), ﬂash crowds incurred by popular tweets (with over
1000 comments and retweets) happen more frequently and ﬁercely than that of
unpopular tweets (with less than 1000 comments and retweets) in the Weibo
system. The underlying distribution infrastructure should be able to eﬃciently
meet such sudden surging demand of video traﬃc.
In Fig. 8, we plot the distribution of time lag between the original video tweet
and its n-th view. It depicts how fast the followers start to watch the tweeted
videos. We observe that, for 87% of tweeted videos, the ﬁrst viewing event occurs
less than 10 minutes after the root video tweet is posted. For 60% of tweeted
videos, the ﬁrst 1000 views arrive within one day. It is largely due to the fast
spreading nature of microblog service.
To further investigate the viewing patterns of tweeted videos, we deﬁne a
new metric called k-active period, k ∈ N+. A period is composed of multiple
consecutive time slots, and each slot lasts for one hour. A k-active period refers
to a period in which each of its slot contains at least k views. For 6,500 tweeted
videos, we identiﬁed 7,039 50-active periods, 4,974 100-active periods, 2,856 150-
active periods and 2,186 200-active periods6. We plot the distribution of the
number of k-active periods per video in Fig. 9. It is observed that most of tweeted

k-active periods, but for k ≥ 50 less than 2% of the active periods show ﬂuctuations.

videos are not highly active with 49% of them having no 50-active period. In the
left 51%, around 39% of tweeted videos have less than three 50-active periods.
Fig. 10 shows the distribution of the duration of active periods. 48% of 50-active
periods, 55% of 100-active periods, 59% of 150-active periods and 63% of 200-
active periods are no greater than one hour. Over 90% of all active periods are
less than ten hours. It means that the popularity of tweeted videos cannot last
for a long period.
3.3 Eﬀects of Social Links
In this section, we will investigate how the social links among users impact video
tweeting. For a tweeted video, we deﬁne the Propagation Distance between the
original tweet publisher and the Weibo viewer as the number of social hops
between them. For example, suppose A is the publisher of a root video tweet,
B, who is A’s follower, retweets that video, then we can think the propagation
path is A → B and the associated propagation distance is one. For each video,
we obtain all its viewers by crawling the video tweet’s RRL, RCL and SCL, and
then calculate the propagation distance between the publisher and viewers.
Fig. 11 depicts the distribution of propagation distance. We ﬁnd that, for over
90% of viewers, their propagation distance is not greater than 3 (see Fig. 11(a)). It

means that video tweeting mostly occurs among close friends/followers. Fig. 11(b)
further shows the distribution of propagation distance for videos with diﬀerent
popularities. We observe a common pattern for all types of videos. Namely, no
matter the popularity of a tweeted video, the majority of viewers are within 3
hops from the original tweet publisher.
3.4 Discussion
In this section, we discuss a few implications of patterns of video tweeting on
the design of future microblog-oriented video distribution platforms: (1) Short
video length: Like UGC sites, most of the tweeted videos are short videos. The
design of content distribution infrastructures should take the patterns of user-
generated contents into account. (2) Diverse user devices: The diversity of user
devices requires to distribute videos in diﬀerent versions. A promising direction
is to conduct real-time transcoding for diﬀerent devices (e.g., cloud-based video
transcoding). (3) Frequent ﬂash crowds: Real-time tweeting enables many users
to learn and watch a new video almost simultaneously. The induced ﬂash crowds
pose a large challenge to the video distribution platform. Online bandwidth
provisioning strategies are needed to meet the unpredictable surging demand.
(4) Small propagation distance: The majority of viewers are within 3 hops of the
publisher. It is possible to perform eﬃcient prefetching based on social distance
to improve the user experience.
4 Related Work
In recent years, researchers have conducted extensive measurement work to un-
derstand the characteristics of popular Web 2.0 applications.
In the aspect of user-generated contents, most of previous work focused on
the measurement of YouTube, including its video sharing patterns [4], traﬃc
characterization[9], etc. To realize eﬃcient distribution of user-generated con-
tents, Liu et al. [8] proposed a peer-assisted approach to reduce the load on
CDN servers. In [5], Cheng et al. conducted an online Web survey among tens
of users and proposed a P2P-based design for video sharing. Krishnappa et al.
[7] performed a measurement study of Hulu-like TV services and studied the
feasibility of prefetching and caching.
Diﬀerent from previous work, our work focuses on analyzing the characteristics
of microblog-triggered video sharing, and our main purpose is to direct the design
of future video distribution infrastructure. We are among the ﬁrst to study video
tweeting by real measurements. In addition, our measurements are based on Sina
Weibo, which is the largest microblog service in China. To our knowledge, no
similar work has been conducted on either the Weibo or Twitter systems before.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we perform a measurement study on video tweeting over the Sina
Weibo system. With a customized measurement platform, we collect the video
Unveiling the Patterns of Video Tweeting
175
tweets posted by 1 million Weibo users and further obtain video information
from their corresponding web sites. We ﬁnd that most of tweeted videos are
short videos and there exist frequent ﬂash crowds for video tweeting. Diverse
mobile devices are used to watch tweeted videos. In addition, Weibo users mostly
intend to only watch videos tweeted by their friends within a few hops. Next,
we plan to extend our measurement to a larger scale, and to design eﬃcient
caching and prefetching strategies to further improve the eﬀectiveness of social
video distribution.
