# Analysis of User Device and Viewing Patterns in Weibo Video Sharing

## 1. Introduction
This study examines the characteristics of video sharing on Sina Weibo, a leading microblogging platform in China. The analysis focuses on the types of devices used for video viewing, the dynamics of video popularity, and the impact of social links on video sharing. 

## 2. Device Distribution
### 2.1 Overview
The retweet or comment of a tweet includes the device type used by a Weibo user. This allows us to determine which devices are commonly used to watch tweeted videos.

### 2.2 Results
- **Figure 5** shows that 32% of viewers use mobile devices, while 68% use personal computers.
- **Figure 6** provides a detailed breakdown of mobile clients:
  - iPhones: 32.7%
  - Android phones: 34.2%
  - iPads: 8%
  - Android Pads: 1.8%
  - Symbian devices: 10%
  - Windows Phones: <0.1%
  - Unknown devices: 12%

### 2.3 Implications
- As the number of mobile users increases, peer-to-peer (P2P) solutions may become impractical due to limited battery life and bandwidth.
- The diversity of mobile devices (e.g., different screen sizes, video codecs) requires video service providers to offer multiple versions of videos to ensure compatibility.

## 3. Popularity Dynamics
### 3.1 Methodology
We use the timestamp embedded in retweets or comments to approximate the viewing time of a video. This is feasible as most Weibo users tend to retweet or comment immediately after watching a video.

### 3.2 Results
- **Figure 7** shows the evolution of the number of views for the top 5 popular videos. The number of views is approximated by the sum of retweets and comments.
- **Flash Crowds**: For example, Video 1 experienced a sudden increase to nearly 20,000 views within one hour, likely induced by a social star's retweet or the Weibo system's recommendation.
- **Figure 8** illustrates the distribution of time lag between the original video tweet and its n-th view:
  - 87% of videos have their first viewing event within 10 minutes.
  - 60% of videos receive their first 1000 views within one day.

### 3.3 k-Active Periods
- A **k-active period** is defined as a period where each hour contains at least k views.
- **Figure 9** shows the distribution of k-active periods:
  - 49% of videos have no 50-active period.
  - 39% of videos have less than three 50-active periods.
- **Figure 10** depicts the duration of active periods:
  - 48% of 50-active periods, 55% of 100-active periods, 59% of 150-active periods, and 63% of 200-active periods last no more than one hour.
  - Over 90% of all active periods last less than ten hours.

## 4. Effects of Social Links
### 4.1 Propagation Distance
- **Propagation Distance** is defined as the number of social hops between the original tweet publisher and the viewer.
- **Figure 11(a)** shows that over 90% of viewers are within 3 hops of the original publisher.
- **Figure 11(b)** further breaks down the propagation distance for videos with different popularities, showing a similar pattern regardless of video popularity.

## 5. Discussion
- **Short Video Length**: Most tweeted videos are short, and content distribution infrastructures should be designed to handle this characteristic.
- **Diverse User Devices**: The need to distribute videos in different versions can be addressed through real-time transcoding (e.g., cloud-based transcoding).
- **Frequent Flash Crowds**: Real-time tweeting leads to simultaneous viewing, posing challenges for video distribution platforms. Online bandwidth provisioning strategies are necessary.
- **Small Propagation Distance**: Prefetching based on social distance can improve user experience.

## 6. Related Work
- Previous studies have focused on YouTube and other video-sharing platforms, but this work is unique in analyzing microblog-triggered video sharing, particularly on Sina Weibo.

## 7. Conclusion
This study provides insights into the characteristics of video sharing on Sina Weibo, including device usage, popularity dynamics, and the impact of social links. Future work will extend the measurement scale and explore efficient caching and prefetching strategies.
