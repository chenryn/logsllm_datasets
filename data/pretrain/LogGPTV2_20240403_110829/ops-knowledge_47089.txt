User: i have a large number of files/folders coming in each day that are being sorted automatically to a wide variety of folders. I'm looking for a way to automatically find these files/folders and create symlinks to them all within an "incoming" folder. Searching for file age should be sufficient for finding the files, however searching for age and owner would be ideal. Then once the files/folders being linked to reach a certain age, say 5 days, remove the symlinks to them automatically from the "incoming" folder. Is this possible to do with a simple shell or python script that can be run with cron? Thanks!
Assistant: Use incron to create the symlink, then find -L in cron to break it.
