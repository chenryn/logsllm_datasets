Abstract. A small part of the IPv4 address space has still not been
assigned for use to any organization. However, some of this IP space
is announced through BGP, and is, therefore, globally reachable. These
preﬁxes which are a subset of the bogon preﬁxes, constitute what we call
the blackspace.It is generally admitted that the blackspace stands to be
abused by anybody who wishes to carry out borderline and/or illegal
activities without being traced.
The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we propose a novel
methodology to accurately identify the IP blackspace. Based on data
collected over a period of seven months, we study the routing-level char-
acteristics of these networks and identify some benign reasons why these
networks are announced on the Internet. Second, we focus on the security
threat associated with these networks by looking at their application-
level footprint. We identify live IP addresses and leverage them to ﬁn-
gerprint services running in these networks. Using this data we uncover
a large amount of spam and scam activities. Finally, we present a case
study of conﬁrmed fraudulent routing of IP blackspace.
1 Introduction
The global BGP (Boder Gateway Protocol) routing table now contains over 600 k
distinct IPv4 preﬁxes. A few of these preﬁxes should not be globally announced
(such as the private IP space) and are collectively referred to as bogon preﬁxes.
A subset of bogon preﬁxes, which we call the blackspace, is composed only of
preﬁxes that have not been assigned for use to any organization.
These unallocated, yet globally announced and reachable blackspace pre-
ﬁxes traditionally hold a bad reputation. On top of uselessly cluttering up the
global routing table, there have been reports of DDoS (Distributed Denial of
Service) attacks originated from blackspace address blocks [19]. Spammers are
also believed to abuse the blackspace in order to stealthily announce and abuse
routes [8]. By extension, it is admitted that the blackspace stands to be abused
by anybody who wishes to carry out borderline and/or illegal activities without
being traced.

Q. Jacquemart et al.
Because it is unallocated, hijacking a blackspace preﬁx is more likely to
go unnoticed. Traditional hijacking detection tools, such as Argus [16], focus
on “regular” preﬁx hijackings, i.e. situations in which the hijacked preﬁx is
announced by the attacker alongside the owner’s legitimate announcement. In
the case of blackspace preﬁxes, there is no rightful owner, and thus no legitimate
announcement that can be used to ﬁnd an anomaly. Consequently, hijacking
blackspace preﬁxes is out of the detection scope of state-of-the-art monitoring
tools. Hijacking a blackspace preﬁx is also diﬀerent from hijacking a dormant
preﬁx, as analyzed in [22]. Dormant preﬁxes have been handed out for active use
to organizations, but are globally unannounced; whereas blackspace preﬁxes are
unallocated, and should not be globally announced.
Therefore, it is recommended to ﬁlter out bogons (including the blackspace),
so as to minimize the window of opportunity of potential abusers. Unfortu-
nately, the blackspace constantly varies in size and shape, according to new pre-
ﬁx assignments and preﬁx returns that are carried out daily by diﬀerent Internet
actors. Filtering out bogons is therefore inconvenient and tricky. In order to auto-
mate the process as much as possible, Team Cymru provides multiple lists with
diﬀerent levels of granularity that can be included directly in a BGP router’s
conﬁguration [18].
This paper focuses on the study of blackspace preﬁxes and aims to clarify
what the blackspace contains. A partly similar study, which encompassed all
bogon preﬁxes [8], was carried out over 10 years ago. The formal reporting of
malicious events carried out from the blackspace, [19], is even older. Back then,
the IPv4 landscape was much diﬀerent from today’s, and the results provided
by these works are not applicable anymore in today’s Internet.
We start by detailing the method that we use to isolate the blackspace pre-
ﬁxes from the BGP routing table. We then provide a thorough study of the
blackspace networks on two diﬀerent levels. First, we look at the information we
extract from the BGP control plane and study the size of the blackspace. We then
study the persistence and change in the blackspace through time. We character-
ize the origin ASes (Autonomous Systems) that actively announce blackspace
by using semantic information (e.g. WHOIS records). Second, we look at the
data plane and focus exclusively on the security threat associated with the
blackspace preﬁxes. In order to do so, we actively seek live IP addresses and
extract the domain name for these machines. We check the websites running in
the blackspace, analyze their content, and check if their URLs are known to be
malicious. We use an IP blacklist to locate hosts that are associated with adware,
scam, phishing, and other malicious activities. Finally, we check for spamming
activities and show how some spammers skillfully abuse the unallocated IP space
in order to remain anonymous.
This paper is organized in the following way. Section 2 details the method
and the datasets we use in order to locate the blackspace inside the BGP rout-
ing table. Section 3 details our analysis results: Sect. 3.1 studies the size and
variation of the blackspace; Sect. 3.2 details the BGP topology characteristics
of the blackspace preﬁxes; Sect. 3.3 details the active measurements we do on
blackspace networks, as well as a detailed threat analysis. Section 4 discusses

the shortcomings of our approach. Section 5 provides a summary of the existing
work and this domain, and how our eﬀorts diﬀer, and improve the current state-
of-the-art. Finally, Sect. 6 summarizes our ﬁndings and provides a few ways to
improve our system.
2 Isolating the Blackspace
In this Section, we detail how we isolate the blackspace preﬁxes within the global
BGP routing table by using a combination of distinct datasets that provide
information about IP assignments. This step is necessary because there is no
information on how the current bogon list [18] is populated. We show later, in
Sect. 5, that our methodology for identifying the IP blackspace is more accurate
and ﬁner grained than previous eﬀorts.
2.1 IP Space Assignation Hierarchy
To better understand our methodology, it is perhaps best to ﬁrst brieﬂy mention
how the IP address space is divided into multiple blocks by distinct institutions
before being assigned to end users, such as ISPs, corporations, or academic insti-
tutions. First, the IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) is in charge of
distributing /8 preﬁxes to RIRs (Regional Internet Registries). There are ﬁve
RIRs, each responsible for a diﬀerent geographical area. In turn, RIRs allocate
IP address space to LIRs (Local Internet Registries), such as ISPs, large corpora-
tions, academic institutions, etc. LIRs enforce their RIR’s policies and distribute
IP address blocks at the local level, i.e. to end users [1,14].
2.2 Deﬁnitions
Bogon preﬁxes have traditionally been loosely deﬁned as any IP preﬁx in the
BGP routing table that should not be globally reachable. More precisely, fol-
lowing the deﬁnitions of [18], a preﬁx is a bogon if any of the three following
conditions is true: (i) it is a martian preﬁx, i.e. if it is a preﬁx that was reserved
for special use by an RFC, such as the private IP address space; (ii) the preﬁx
belongs to a block that was not assigned to any RIR by the IANA; (iii) the preﬁx
belongs to a block that was not assigned by a RIR to a LIR, or to an end user.
We deﬁne the blackspace preﬁxes as the set of bogon preﬁxes that are not
martians and that are announced in BGP. In other words, it is the set of BGP-
announced preﬁxes that have not been assigned for use – either because it still
belongs to the IANA pool, or because a RIR has not assigned it to an ISP or
an end user. We explicitly remove martian preﬁxes because they are most likely
the result of a local route leak caused by a misconﬁguration [8]. Moreover, since
these preﬁxes are internally routed in a lot of networks, we are unlikely to reach
martian-originating networks from our own, rendering any standard network
diagnostics utility such as ping or traceroute pointless.

2.3
Internet Routing Registries
The IRRs (Internet Routing Registries) are a set of distributed databases main-
tained by the ﬁve RIRs where network operators can provide information regard-
ing their network on a voluntary basis. In particular, the inetnum objects contain
information regarding IP address space assignment [2]. Consequently, the IRR
databases sound like the ideal starting point to isolate the IP blackspace. We
need to access the database of each RIR, and extract the IP ranges mentioned in
inetnum objects. We then have to check the preﬁxes announced in BGP against
the ones we found in the IRRs, and keep those that do not match.
Unfortunately, things are not quite that simple. Like previously stated, pro-
viding information in the IRR databases is in no way mandatory, and even
though it is considered as a good practice for LIRs to maintain their allocation
information up to date, they are in no way required to do so. Additionally (and
somehow consequently), the IRR databases are manually updated, and thus are
plagued with typical human errors, such as typos. For example, some inetnum
objects end their network on a .225 IP address, where the right value would be
255; some objects explicitly discard their net address, and/or their broadcast
address, etc. Due to these reasons, we cannot expect to have an exact mapping
between the BGP preﬁxes and the IRR preﬁxes. As a result, if we cannot match a
BGP preﬁx to an IRR preﬁx, we take into consideration inetnum objects that are
within the BGP preﬁx (i.e. inetnum objects that are more speciﬁc than the BGP
preﬁx). If over 95 % of the address space of the BGP preﬁx is covered by more
speciﬁc IRR preﬁxes, we consider the BGP preﬁx has having been assigned, and
that providing a matching IRR entry was overlooked. Our reasoning is that each
customer of LIRs (which may be other ISPs) potentially wishes to update the
IRR database, if only to update the management information of their network,
such as technical and administrative contact details.
2.4 RIR Statistics Files
Every day, each RIR publishes a report – sometimes known as the delegation
report – on the current status of the use they make of resources they have been
allocated, including IP address space [3]. This report breaks down each RIR’s
IP address pool into four distinct states: allocated, assigned, available,
and reserved. The ﬁrst two states, allocated and assigned, are similar in
the fact that they both have been marked as usable by someone by the RIR,
i.e. these addresses can be announced. The diﬀerence is that allocated space
ought to be used by LIRs for suballocation, whereas assigned space should not
– i.e. it should be used directly by the LIR or end user. As the name suggests, the
available state contains addresses that have not been allocated or assigned
to any entity. Finally, the reserved state is somehow an intermediate between
the other states: it has not been allocated (or assigned) to anybody, but is
also not available for such purposes. For example, these addresses might be
reserved for the growth of a LIR, returns that have not been cleared yet, or
experimental space [3]. In this classiﬁcation, the blackspace is shared between
reserved and available states: in both cases there should not be any public
BGP announcement for these addresses.

2.5 Blackspace Computation Process
Our BGP dataset is built on the data provided by the RIPE RIS collectors [15].
We daily fetch the routing table of each of the 13 active, geographically diverse
routers, and create a list of all globally reachable routes. In the same time, we
daily extract all inetnum objects from each IRR database, and we compare these
two datasets as described in Sect. 2.3. We then remove from the remaining BGP
preﬁxes the parts for which there exists an IRR entry. For illustrative purposes,
let’s consider (a real-world case) where a /21 preﬁx is announced in BGP, and
where only one of the /22 more speciﬁc preﬁxes has an inetnum entry. We
remove the /22 that is in the IRR from the blackspace, leaving only the other
/22 in it. At this point, there is a one-to-n relationship between the preﬁxes in
the blackspace and the preﬁxes as announced in BGP: a single BGP-announced
preﬁx can result in multiple entries in the blackspace once the registered parts
have been removed.
We further ﬁlter the results by discarding preﬁxes that are marked as
assigned or allocated by RIRs in their statistics ﬁles. Once more, there are
cases in which the remaining preﬁxes are in multiple states wrt. the statistics
ﬁles states, e.g. the IP space is allocated and reserved. In this situation, we
only keep the part of address space that is either reserved or available.
It is noteworthy that, although using both the IRRs and the statistics ﬁles
might appear redundant, there are documented inconsistencies between the two
distinct datasets [10]. Because we aim at investigating the blackspace, it is essen-
tial to use these multiple sources in order to circumvent the limitations inherent
to each dataset and to focus exclusively on real blackspace preﬁxes so as to avoid
introducing bias in our results.
3 Blackspace Analysis
In this Section, we study the blackspace networks over a period of seven months,
between September 2014 and March 2015. In Sects. 3.1 and 3.2, we consider the
routing-level characteristics of the blackspace networks, and identify some pat-
terns for legitimate blackspace announcements. Then, in Sect. 3.3, we seek to
determine the security threat posed by the blackspace networks by looking at the
application-level services running in these networks, and by checking whether they
were involved in some malicious activities like spamming or scam website hosting.
Finally we provide a case study of a conﬁrmed case of cybercriminals who carried
out nefarious activities such as spamming by abusing available IP space.
3.1 Prevalence and Persistence
In this Section, we focus on a few essential aspects of the blackspace by looking
at the size, temporal characteristics, and variation of the blackspace. In order to
116
Q. Jacquemart et al.
observe those, we computed the blackspace once per day between September 1st,
2014 and March 31, 2015 with the method detailed in Sect. 2. We compute the
blackspace once a day because the IRR databases we use and the RIR statistic
ﬁles are updated with this same frequency.
During our observation, the number of globally distinct preﬁxes from our
collector routers varied between 550k and 600k preﬁxes. These preﬁxes route
around 180 equivalent /8 IP addresses, i.e. the equivalent of 180 class A networks,
or 180 × 224 IP addresses. The reason we focus on the number of IP addresses
instead of the number of preﬁxes is that, because of the methodology explained
in Sect. 2, the relationship between a BGP preﬁx and a blackspace preﬁx is a
one-to-many. By taking an aggregated BGP preﬁx and removing parts of it,
we virtually inﬂate the number of preﬁxes in the blackspace, even though this
larger number of preﬁxes actually represents a smaller IP space, rendering the
preﬁx count meaningless. Figure 1 plots the daily number of IP addresses in
the blackspace, as seen from a global BGP point of view. It shows that the
blackspace size normally varies between 10−2 and 10−1 eqv. /8. It also shows
that this number is relatively stable, apart from two peaks in October 2014 and
January 2015. We investigated the reasons behind these peaks and attributed
them to the announcement of 192.0.0.0/2 between October 15, 2014 and October
20, 2014; and a series of smaller preﬁxes between January 24, 2015 and January
29, 2015. We classify these events as routing leaks because they meet the criterias
behind BGP misconﬁgurations detailed in [11]: a relative short-duration, and
low visibility. Only three collector routers received the a route for 192.0.0.0/2 in
October, and only one received the multiple preﬁxes in January 2015. Moreover,
in both cases, only a single Autonomous System path (AS path) was seen, and
the origin AS was a private AS number. All in all, Fig. 1 shows that the entirety
of the blackspace could generally be contained in a single preﬁx, whose CIDR
length would be between a /10 and a /15.
