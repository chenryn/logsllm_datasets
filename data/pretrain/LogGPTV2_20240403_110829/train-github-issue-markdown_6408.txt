It is a situation that occurs after minification with mangling, but I tried to
reproduce without minification by using the same class name for both
components (since I don't know how to easily provide a minified example in
Plunkr). Mangling will typically convert all class names to something like
"a".  
As you can see, both components are rendered with the template of Component2,
unless you switch back to beta.0.
I have found several other issues about minification, but not any open one
that is exactly the same as this.  
#6397 mentions there might be name collisions in TemplateCompiler.
