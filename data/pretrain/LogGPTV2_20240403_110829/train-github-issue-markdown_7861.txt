### Issue Description
I have thoroughly searched the issues in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

#### Expected Behavior
When the Dialog is closed, the Tooltip should not reappear.

#### Current Behavior
After closing the Dialog, the Tooltip reappears. To make it disappear, an additional click is required.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Wrap a Button, which will open a Dialog on click, with a Tooltip.
2. Hover over the Button; the Tooltip appears.
3. Click the Button; the Tooltip disappears, and the Dialog opens.
4. Close the Dialog; the Tooltip reappears. An additional click is needed to make it disappear.
