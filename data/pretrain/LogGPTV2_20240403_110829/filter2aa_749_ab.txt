How to React?
✦ Option 1: Use HTTPS
✦ Encryption prevents in-ﬂight changes
✦ But... costly and rigid
✦ Can’t allow security checks, caching, etc.

Why monitor P2P?
Copyright infringement: 
movies, music, software, books, etc.
P2P Monitoring Today
1. Crawl P2P networks
2. Identify infringing users
3. Report infringement to ISP
Sample complaint
XXX has reasonable good faith belief that use of the material 
in the manner complained of in the attached report is not 
authorized by YYY, its agents, or the law. The information 
provided herein is accurate to the best of our knowledge. 
Therefore, this letter is an ofﬁcial notiﬁcation to effect 
removal of the detected infringement listed in the attached 
report. The attached documentation speciﬁes the exact 
location of the infringement.
to the best of our knowledge.
What does this mean?
Our work
✦ Goal: Reverse engineer P2P monitoring and
           copyright enforcement in BitTorrent
✦ Findings:
1. Monitoring is sometimes inconclusive
(and can be manipulated)
2. Some monitoring agents are highly 
distinguishable

Framed complaints generated during May, 2008
Avoiding Monitoring
✦ IP blacklists prevent communication with 
suspected monitoring agents
✦ But, blacklists do not cover some some hosts:
✦ ...that refuse incoming connections
✦ ...that are listed in 10s of swarms per day
✦ ...that are hosted at colocation facilities
Lessons & Challenges
✦ Direct monitoring would reduce false positives, but it  
would also signiﬁcantly increase overhead.
✦ ISPs should sanity-check complaints, but increasing 
complaint volume increases costs.
✦ Blacklisting techniques are likely to improve, but 
direct involvement of ISPs in monitoring is increasing.

Discovering and 
Exploring New 
Attack Classes  
Properties of these projects
✦ Sometimes we discover a new way -- or class of ways 
-- to attack and existing system
✦ When we do so, we try to deeply study these new 
attacks.  For example
✦ Intensive experiments to help us fully understand 
the attacks
✦ Explorations of multiple instantiations or 
generalizations of the attacks
✦ Explore extensions to the attacks
✦ Explore potential defenses

Information 
Leakage Vector 
(TCP)
 “The timestamp value to be sent in [each outgoing 
packet] is to be obtained from a (virtual) clock that we 
call the timestamp [TSopt] clock.  Its values must be at 
least approximately proportional to real time. ”
RFC 1323 deﬁnes the TCP Timestamps Option:
Information leakage in TCP
This is information leakage because different devices 
may have TSopt clocks that advance at different rates 
(based on the devices’ TSopt clock skews).
Information leakage in TCP
A device’s TSopt clock may be different from its system 
clock.  NTP adjustments to a devices system clock may 
not affect the device’s TSopt clock.
Information leakage in TCP
Extracting information
Let t denote the value of the measurer’s system 
clock when it recorded the i-th packet.
Let C denote the value of the sender’s TSopt 
clock when it generated the i-th packet.
i
i
Extracting information
Assume (for now) that
•the t values reﬂect the true time at which 
the i-th packet was recorded;
•the C values have inﬁnite precision;
•there is no network delay;
•the sender’s TSopt clock has constant clock 
skew s; common values for s are between 
-100 and 100 ppm;
•t = C = 0.
Then, by the deﬁnition of clock skew,
C = t + st
for all i.

Extracting information
Under these assumptions, 
we learn the sender’s clock 
skew as follows:
For each packet, plot
(t , C - t ) .

Since, by deﬁnition
C - t = st ,
the skew s is the slope 
between any two points.

Artiﬁcial data
Example
✦ One of UCSD’s undergraduate computing 
laboratories has 69 Micron 448 MHz PII 
machines, all running Windows XP SP1.
✦ measurer1 runs Debian 3.0 and synchronizes 
its system time with NTP.
measurer1 is 3 hops away from the 
undergraduate laboratory.
Example
1. From measurer1 and at random intervals 
between 0 and 5 minutes, open connections to 
each machine in the lab.
2. Record a trace on measurer1.
3. Create a plot of (t , C - t ) for each machine in 
the lab.

Obtaining data
The TCP Timestamps Option is an option.
✦ Not all packets will have the option enabled.
✦ There are cases when a measurer cannot

Windows-initiated ﬂows
✦ When a Windows machine initiates a TCP 
connection, the initial SYN packet will not 
have the TCP Timestamps Option enabled.
✦ According to RFC 1323, none of the 
subsequent packets in the ﬂow will contain the 
TCP Timestamps Option.
A “Yes” means that a measurer can force the 
system to use the TCP Timestamps Option.

A “trick” for the measurer
✦ An active measurer could re-write packets in a 
Windows-initiated ﬂow so that the Windows 
machine receives packets containing the TCP 
Timestamps Option.
✦ The Windows machine will subsequently include 
the TCP Timestamps Option in its outgoing 
packets for this ﬂow.
A “trick” for the measurer
Examples:
✦ An ISP could re-write all outgoing SYN 
packets so that the re-written packets 
contain the TCP Timestamps Option.
✦ A website could reply to all SYN packets 
with SYN/ACK packets containing the TCP 
Timestamps Option.
Advantage to active measurers
An active measurer can force a device to 
send a large number of packets, or send 
packets over a long duration of time.

Generalizations 
(e.g, ICMP)
Information leakage in ICMP
✦ RFC 792 deﬁnes ICMP Timestamp Request 
and Timestamp Reply messages.
✦ If a measurer sends a ﬁngerprintee a 
Timestamp Request message, some 
ﬁngerprintees will reply with a Timestamp 
Reply message containing the ﬁngerprintee’s 
system time.
✦ A measurer receiving these Timestamp Reply 
messages could estimate the ﬁngerprintee’s 
system time clock skew.
A “Yes” means that a measurer can use our 
ICMP-based method to ﬁngerprint a device.

For the remainder of this talk we shall focus on 
our TCP-based method because:
✦ If a measurer can use our ICMP-based 
method, then the measurer could also use 
our TCP-based method.
✦ The results of most of our experiments on 
our TCP-based method should generalize to 
our ICMP-based method.
