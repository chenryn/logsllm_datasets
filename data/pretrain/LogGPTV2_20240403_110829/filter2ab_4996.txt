**ATT&CK ID:** T1596  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Search Open Technical Databases

Adversaries may exploit freely available technical databases to gather information about potential targets. This information, which can be used in subsequent attack planning, is often found in various online resources, including:

- **Domain and Certificate Registrations:** Publicly accessible records that provide details on domain ownership and SSL/TLS certificate registrations.
- **Public Network Data Repositories:** Collections of network data and artifacts gathered from internet traffic and scans, which can reveal information about the target's infrastructure and vulnerabilities.

By leveraging these sources, adversaries can gain valuable insights into their targets, facilitating more effective and targeted attacks.
