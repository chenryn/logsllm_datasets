ABSTRACT 
Twitter is one of the most popular Online Social Networks (OSNs) 
nowadays. Twitter users retrieve information from other  users  by 
subscribing  to  their  tweets.  Twitter  users,  especially  those  who 
have many followees, may receive hundreds or even thousands of 
tweets  daily.  Currently,  all  tweets  are  shown  to  users  in  chrono-
logical order. Consequently, a Twitter user may accidentally over-
look  useful  and  interesting  tweets  because  the  user  is  over-
whelmed by the huge volume of uninteresting tweets. Researchers 
in  the  recommendation  system  community  have  proposed  using 
recommendation techniques such as collaborative filtering to pre-
dict  users’  preference  of  tweets  and  highlight  those  tweets  in 
which  users  are  most  likely  to  be  interested.  At  the  same  time, 
while OSNs such as Twitter have enabled people to conveniently 
share information and interact with each other online, OSN users 
are  getting  increasingly  concerned  about  their  online  privacy. 
Researchers in the security community have proposed using tech-
niques such as  encrypted  tweets  to  protect  users’  privacy.  In  this 
paper,  we  propose  a  privacy-preserving  personalized  tweet  rec-
ommendation  framework,  pTwitterRec,  in  a  Twitter-like  social 
network  where  users’  tweets  are  hidden  from  the  OSN  provider. 
pTwitterRec provides users with personalized tweet recommenda-
tions  while  keeping  users’  tweets  and  interests  hidden  from  the 
OSN provider as well as other unauthorized entities. pTwitterRec 
splits the tweet recommendation task between the  provider  and  a 
semi-trusted third party, so that neither can derive users’ sensitive 
information  alone  while  working  together  to  provide  users  with 
personalized  tweet  recommendations.  We  implement  a  prototype 
and demonstrate through evaluation that pTwitterRec incurs toler-
able overhead on today’s smartphones.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
Twitter is a popular online social networking website  and  micro-
blogging  service  that  allows  users  to  conveniently  share  short 
messages  of  up  to  140  characters,  known  as  “tweets”,  with  their 
online  followers.  With  more  than  550  million  active  registered 
Twitter users nowadays, approximately 58 million tweets are gen-
erated  per  day  [38].  Twitter  users  on  average  follow  80  people 
[29],  which  leads  to  hundreds  or  even  thousands  of  new  tweets 
received  by  each  user  every  day.  Currently,  all  tweets  are  shown 
to users in  chronological  order,  which  may  lead  to  users  missing 
some informative and interesting tweets simply because users are 
overwhelmed by other tweets that do not interest them at all. Re-
searchers [10, 14, 21] have proposed using various recommenda-
tion  techniques  that  utilize  all  kinds  of  information  available  on 
Twitter (such as users’ tweet history and social relations) to rank 
tweets  and  display  those  tweets  that  might  interest  the  user  most 
on top. 
In the meantime, users of Online Social Networks (OSNs) such as 
Twitter  are  increasingly  concerned  about  privacy  issues  [30].  In 
general, OSN providers are considered to be trustworthy,  as  they 
have a valuable reputation to maintain and any suspicion of mali-
cious behaviors could potentially lead to a significant loss of users. 
As a result, users trust OSN providers by default to properly safe-
guard and manage the contents published by users. Unfortunately, 
users’ privacy is at risk by placing trust completely on OSN pro-
viders.  For  example,  OSNs’  Terms  of  Service  typically  include 
clauses  that  explicitly/implicitly  allow  the  provider  to  mine  user 
content for the purpose of delivering targeted advertising or resel-
ling to third party services [12]. Also, in regions where OSNs are 
closely  monitored  by  unscrupulous  and  suppressive  governments 
[32],  it  is  crucial  to  guarantee  that  only  users’  explicitly  autho-
rized  followers/friends  can  access  their  data.  Researchers  in  the 
security community have proposed several approaches [3, 12, 16, 
23] to achieve this goal by delegating control over content to end 
users. 
The  contributions  of  this  paper  are  as  follows:  Our  work  is  the 
first, to our best knowledge, to propose a privacy-preserving per-
sonalized  tweet  recommendation  framework,  pTwitterRec.  We 
enhance  an  existing  personalized  tweet  recommendation  algo-
rithm with a few cryptographic protocols and split the recommen-
dation task between the provider of the Twitter-like service and a 
semi-trusted  third  party,  so  that  users  obtain  personalized  tweet 
recommendations  without  leaking  any  sensitive  information  to 
unauthorized  entities.  We  demonstrate  the  practicality  through 
365implementation and evaluation of the overhead incurred by pTwit-
terRec.  pTwitterRec  only  introduces  minimum  overhead  on  the 
user  side  while  achieving  the  privacy  goal,  compared  with  the 
original  tweet  recommendation  algorithm,  which  was  designed 
with  no  privacy  in  mind.  In  this  paper,  we  positively  answer  the 
following  question:  in  a  Twitter-like  OSN,  can  we  provide  users 
with  the  benefits  of  personalized  tweet  recommendations  while 
keeping  the  contents  of  users'  tweets  and  users'  interests  hidden 
from the provider as well as other unauthorized parties? 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, 
we  overview  the  related  work.  In  Section  3,  we  introduce  the 
background of our work. In Section 4, we describe our system and 
threat  models.  In  Section  5,  we  present  in  detail  our  proposed 
privacy-preserving  personalized  tweet  recommendation  frame-
work  pTwitterRec.  In  Section  6,  we  discuss  the  security  and  pri-
vacy  aspects  and  a  possible  extension  of  pTwitterRec.  We  de-
scribe  the  server-side  implementation  in  Section  7.  We  analyze 
and  evaluate  the  overhead  incurred  by  pTwitterRec  in  Section  8. 
Finally we conclude our work in Section 9. 
2.  RELATED WORK 
2.1  Tweet Recommendations 
Researchers  have  proposed  recommendation  systems  for  Twitter. 
Chen  et  al.  [9]  focus  on  recommending  URLs  on  Twitter  that  a 
Twitter  user  might  find  interesting.  Hannon  et  al.  [17]  develop  a 
followee  recommender  system  for  Twitter  that  utilizes  Twitter’s 
real-time information as a source of recommendation knowledge. 
Diaz-Aviles  et  al.  [13]  propose  using  collaborative  filtering  to 
recommend hash tags on Twitter in real-time.  
Some researchers focus on recommending tweets that are interest-
ing to users. Duan et al. [14] propose using learning to rank algo-
rithms  to  rank  tweets  based  on  the  user  query.  Their  approach 
considers  quality  of  tweets  and  authority  of  the  publishers  but 
does  not  consider  user  personalization.  Ramage  et  al.  [31]  pro-
pose using latent variable topic models like Labeled LDA to map 
the  content  of  the  Twitter  feed  into  dimensions  and  then  filter 
Twitter  feeds  for  users.  Their  approach  uses  content-based  filter-
ing and does not consider users’ social relations. Naveed et al. [21] 
propose using a learning approach based on pure content features 
to  predict  the  probability  of  a  message  being  retweeted.  Their 
work  does  not  consider  user  personalization,  either.  Chen  et  al. 
[10]  propose  using  collaborative  ranking  to  recommend  tweets 
that are personally interesting to a user. Their approach considers 
not only explicit features such as quality of the tweet and authori-
ty  of  the  publisher,  but  also  tweet  topic  level  latent  factors  and 
social relation latent factors. Experiments on real-world data show 
that their approach outperforms other tweet recommendation algo-
rithms in terms of mean average precision (MAP). 
Our  work  is  based  on  the  tweet  recommendation  algorithm  pro-
posed by Chen et al. [10]. In addition, we provide users with per-
sonalized tweet recommendations while preserving user privacy. 
2.2  Privacy-preserving Recommendations 
Privacy for traditional recommender systems such as collaborative 
filtering has been extensively studied. Canny [7, 8] propose using 
homomorphic  encryption  and  a  peer-to-peer  protocol  to  provide 
privacy  for  model-based  collaborative  recommender  systems. 
Polat  and  Du  [25–28]  propose  that  customers  adopt  randomized 
perturbation  techniques  to  disturb  their  private  data  before  send-
ing  the  data  to  the  service  provider  for  recommender  systems. 
Aïmeur et al. [1] propose using a semi-trusted third party to distill 
encoded  sensitive  customer  information,  which  can  be  used  to 
produce recommendations but cannot be decrypted by any  of  the 
concerned parties alone. 
In  personalized  tweet  recommendations,  tweets  are  regarded  as 
items and many unique Twitter features such as content informa-
tion and social relation information need to be utilized to improve 
recommendation  accuracy.  None  of  the  abovementioned  ap-
proaches can be trivially adapted to  offer  personalized  tweet  rec-
ommendations while preserving user privacy. 
2.3  Privacy-preserving OSNs 
There  has  been  significant  work  in  OSN  privacy.  Our  work  is 
most related to approaches that aim to protect social network  us-
ers’  privacy  from  a  curious  OSN  provider.  Systems  such  as  Fly-
ByNight  [22],  NOYB  [16]  and  Facecloak  [23]  store  users’  data 
with the untrusted provider but protect its content with encryption. 
Conti  et  al.  [11]  propose  establishing  a  virtual  private  network 
between friends on OSNs to share sensitive information. Singh et 
al.  [34]  propose  Twitsper,  a  wrapper  around  Twitter  that  enables 
private group communication among Twitter users while preserv-
ing  Twitter’s  business  interests.  Feldman  et  al.  [15]  propose 
Frientegrity,  a  framework  where  an  OSN  provider  observes  only 
encrypted data and cannot deviate from correct execution without 
being detected. De Cristofaro et al. [12] propose Hummingbird, a 
variant of Twitter that protects users’ tweets as well as  users’  in-
terests from a semi-trusted OSN provider. 
Our work, however, focuses primarily on protecting users’ privacy 
from  a  curious  OSN  provider  while  offering  users  personalized 
tweet recommendations. Our privacy-preserving tweet recommen-
dation  framework  pTwitterRec  can  be  built  upon  any  of  the  ab-
ovementioned approaches as long as the OSN provider is able to 
distribute  tweets  to  the  corresponding  followers  without  learning 
the tweets.  
3.  BACKGROUND 
3.1  Twitter 
Twitter is one of the most popular OSNs that enable users to send 
and read tweets, which are text messages limited to 140 characters. 
A  user  receives  tweets  from  other  users  by  subscribing  to  their 
tweets. Twitter terminology relevant to this paper includes: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Publisher: A user who posts a tweet. 
Follower: A user who follows others’ tweets. 
Followee:  A  user  whose  tweets  are  being  followed  by 
others. 
Tweets: short messages posted by a user/publisher. 
Retweets:  someone  else’s  tweets  that  a  user  chooses  to 
share with all of the user’s followers. 
Service  Provider  (SP):  the  centralized  entity  of  Twitter 
that maintains all user profiles and tweets, and distributes 
users’ tweets to followers. 
Tweets are public by default; that is, any registered user can read 
other users’ public tweets. However, upon registration, a user has 
the  option  of  keeping  the  tweets  only  visible  to  the  user’s  ap-
proved Twitter followers, known as protected tweets. Nonetheless, 
all tweets published by users are not hidden from the SP.

Recommending  useful  tweets  to  a  user  is  a  challenging  problem. 
The key of the problem is how to use any information available on 
Twitter  to  decide  whether  or  not  a  user  is  interested  in  a  tweet. 
Such information available on Twitter includes the quality of  the 
tweet,  the  authority  of  the  publisher,  the  user’s  previous  tweets, 
etc.  With  such  information  as  input,  the  SP  adopts  various  ma-
chining learning techniques such as Collaborative filtering [4, 6], 
LDA [5] or RankSVM [19] to learn a model to predict users’ inter-
ests  in  tweets.  Among  existing  recommendation  algorithms  for 
social updates [5, 10, 14, 18, 19, 21, 35], we adopt the collabora-
tive  personalized  tweet  recommendation  algorithm  proposed  by 
Chen  et  al.  [10]  as  the  building  block  of  our  privacy-preserving 
tweet  recommendation  framework  pTwitterRec.  We  choose  their 
algorithm  over  others  because:  a)  their  tweet  recommendation 
model  not  only  incorporates  explicit  tweet  features  such  as  the 
quality  of  the  tweet  and  the  authority  of  the  publisher,  but  also 
uses topic level latent factors of tweets to capture users’ interests 
and  uses  latent  factors  to  model  users’  social  relations;  b)  their 
model outperforms other up-to-date recommendation models with 
reasonable  computation  cost.  For  example,  the  empirical  results 
show  that  their  method  achieves  46.84%  and  17.41%  improve-
ments  compared  with  the  RankSVM  method  and  joint  matrix 
factorization  method  [35]  in  terms  of  Mean  Average  Precision 
(MAP). 
We briefly describe their tweet recommendation algorithm. For a 
given  user  u  and  two  received  tweets  k  and  h,  assuming  that  the 
hr respectively (user u is more 
ranks of tweets k and h are 
kr and 
u
u
interested  in  tweet  k  than  tweet  h  if 
hr ), 
the authors model the probability of the orders of  tweets k  and  h 
for user u as follows: 
kr is  larger/higher  than u
u
u
(
P r
k

u

                       (1) 
where yu,k represents the predicted rating of user u for tweet k.  
Then, the authors define the rank preference set D as follows: 
D
=   ∈
k Re u h Re u
( ),
( )}
∉

                  (2) 
where Re(u) represents the set of tweets user u has retweeted. D is 
built  based  on  the  assumption  that  users  are  more  interested  in 
those  tweets  that  they  have  retweeted  than  those  they  have  not 
retweeted.  For  a  tuple    in  D,  an  ideal  rating  prediction 
model yu,k maximizes the probability of the ranking order that user 
u ranks tweet k higher than tweet h. To solve this problem for all 
tuples  in  D,  it  is  equivalent  to  solve  the  following  objective  by 
learning  the  optimal  parameters  for  the  rating  prediction  model
