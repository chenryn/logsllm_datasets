spam email was received.
the fastest turnaround of 5 days, while medium turnaround
times of less than two months are observed for harvester A,
B, F and H. Harvester C and E show the longest turnaround
time of more than one year. Long turnaround times suggest
emails being sold on the market and used by entities other
than the harvester. As previous research showed [21], the
purchase of email lists on underground sites is heavily inﬂu-
enced by the reputation of the creator of the list. A reason
for longer turnaround times might be that the reputation of
the harvester is not yet established, and therefore spammers
are less likely to purchase his lists.
3.2 Analysis of the SMTP Dialects
We learned the SMTP dialects for all the clients that sent
emails to the mailserver, as described in Section 2.2. We dis-
carded any SMTP conversation that generated an error, or
for which the client abruptly closed the connection. There-
fore, each SMTP conversation analyzed in this section cor-
responds to an email being delivered to the mailserver. We
logged 2,024 correctly sent emails in total.
Our system identiﬁed seven diﬀerent dialects among the
clients that sent emails to the mailserver. A summary of
these results is shown in Table 5. As it can be seen, the
mailserver was targeted by three of the largest active spam-
ming botnets (Cutwail, Lethic, and Kelihos).
It was also
targeted by MyDoom, which is a generic name used by an-
tivirus companies to refer to email-spreading worms. Our
mailserver was also contacted by two types of MTAs, set up
by miscreants to send spam (Postﬁx and Sendmail ). Note
that, in principle, multiple spammers might use the same
botnet, or set up the same MTA to send spam. We discuss
this possibility in Section 3.4.
The modus operandi of the spammers using each botnet,
worm, and MTA setup is rather diﬀerent. For instance, the
spammers using Lethic did not send emails only to harvested
email address, but also to generic ones (e.g., info, admin).
All other setups leveraged the email addresses harvested by

vesters. 73% of the harvester IP addresses were
located in Germany, while 9% of them came from
China.
also originates from the Google AS. It suggests that har-
vesters use search engines as a proxy to either i) hide their
own identity or ii) optimize the harvesting process itself. We
identiﬁed harvesting software that oﬀers the functionality of
querying search engines. For example, the advertisement
for ECrawl v2.63 [17] states: “Access to the Google cache
(VERY fast harvesting),” while the description of the Fast
Email Harvester 1.2 reports that the “collector supports all
major search engines, such as Google, Yahoo, MSN” [6].
It is interesting to look at where the harvesters are lo-
cated. By using the Maxmind geolocation database [16],
we map harvester IP addresses to geolocation. We addition-
ally map harvester IP addresses to AS numbers. We observe
harvesters from ten countries (eleven Autonomous Systems),
respectively. Figure 3 shows the country distribution of the
IP addresses that harvested the email addresses that we dis-
seminated. A darker color in the map represents a larger
fraction of IP addresses from that country. As it can be
seen, Germany is the country hosting the largest number of
harvesters (73% of the total), followed by China (9%), and
Spain (5%). The prevalence of German IP addresses can be
explained with the fact that the IP addresses of harvester
C, which is composed of 56 IP addresses, are all located in
Germany. On the other hand, the IP addresses of harvester
D, which was the one that was able to gather the highest
number of IP addresses, are located in the Netherlands.
We next focus on harvesting activity periods. The har-
vesting time of email addresses that received spam during
the measurement dates back to 2010. We show the number
of addresses harvested per year in Figure 2. We split the
harvesting activity in activity periods. We deﬁne activity
periods as periods of time in which the harvester connected
to our pages at least once in each of two consecutive hours.
The number of activity periods with their respective start
and end time is shown in Table 2. The harvesting behavior
that we observed during an activity period was typically in-
tense, with a larger number of crawled web sites in a small
time period of several seconds to minutes.
We investigated what happens to e-mail addresses after
they have been harvested by focusing on the usage of har-
vested addresses. Concretely, we denote the time between
the address being harvested and the ﬁrst spam email re-
ceived at that address as the turnaround time and show
their median value in Table 3. Harvester D and G show

Table 5: Summary of the SMTP dialects, the email lists, and the spam campaigns observed. The horizontal
line separates dialects that belong to botnets or generic malware from those that belong to regular Mail
Transfer Agents (MTAs). “None” means that the botnet sent emails to email addresses that were not
harvested, but that are popular default addresses (e.g., admin). We omitted the list of campaigns spammed
by Mydoom, for simplicity.
one or more harvesters. The way in which these addresses
are used varies according to the type of setup too. In gen-
eral, botnets tend to send several emails to each harvested
address, while MTAs limit themselves to one email per ad-
dress, on average.
Table 5 also shows the number of IP addresses that we
observed belonging to each botnet and MTA. As it can
be seen, botmasters use diﬀerent strategies while manag-
ing their bots: Each email sent by Cutwail came from a
diﬀerent IP address (i.e., bot), while Lethic bots are reusing
their email addresses. The time at which the diﬀerent bot-
nets or MTAs contacted the mailserver also varies. In par-
ticular, the Cutwail botnet constantly sent spam emails to
our harvested addresses during the observation period, send-
ing a small number of emails per day, while Lethic started
contacting the mail server in April 2013, sending a higher
number of emails. Mydoom, on the other hand, focused its
activity during March 2013. A summary of the activity of
the various botnets and MTAs that contacted us is pictured
in Figure 4. The size of the circles is proportional to the
number of emails sent by each botnet or MTA during that
day.
As a last element, the diﬀerent botnets show a very dif-
ferent country distribution of their bots: Figure 5 shows
the country distribution for the Cutwail botnet. As it can
be seen, most Cutwail bots are located in Korea (18% of
the total), India (13%), and Serbia (9%). Lethic, on the
other hand, has 92% of its bots located in South Korea
(see Figure 6). This country distribution is not necessar-
ily representative of all Cutwail and Lethic instances: as
previous research showed, spammers rent single instances of
command and control servers and buy their malware instal-
lations separately [3,21]; spammers can go as far as selecting
the countries in which they want their bots to be located.
Therefore, our observation suggests that the botnet users
that sent spam to us purchased their bots in a small number
of countries. Other instances (and customers) of the same
botnet might show very diﬀerent country distributions. The
fact that each spammer uses bots located in diﬀerent coun-
tries is consistent with previous work, which showed that
the physical location of a bot does not inﬂuence the overall
spamming performance of the botnet [10].
On the other hand, the Mydoom worm has most of its
victims in Poland (19% of the total IP addresses) and in
the United States (17%) (see Figure 7). We omit Kelihos
because this botnet sent a very small amount of spam, and
the map would not be meaningful.
We also wanted to understand in which countries spam-
mers set up their mailservers to send spam. Figure 8 shows
the country distribution of the Postﬁx and Sendmail instal-
lations that contacted the mailserver. Two servers were lo-
cated in Russia, while the United States and Canada hosted
one server each. The United Kingdom and Spain also hosted
one server.
3.3 Analysis of the Spam Campaigns
We applied the clustering technique described in Section 2.3
to the emails that we received. In total, we obtained 63 spam
campaigns. Table 6 reports a summary of some of these cam-
paigns. We omitted the 55 spam campaigns carried out by
Mydoom. We suspect that Mydoom might be a generic label
that antivirus companies give to unknown malware samples,
and therefore analyzing the diﬀerent spammers grouped un-
der this label is not very meaningful. For this reason, we
did not analyze this botnet any further.

Table 6: Summary of the observed spam campaigns.
The topic of the campaign was selected by manual
analysis of the spam emails. We omitted the cam-
paigns carried out by Mydoom for simplicity.
As it can be seen in Table 6, the spam campaigns that we
logged cover a large variety of goods and services. Surpris-
ingly, we did not observe any email advertising pharmaceu-
tical products, which has been the focus of the majority of
the underground economy research in the past [11]. While
this might arguably be an artifact in our dataset, it might
also suggest that spammers are moving on to exploring other
ways of generating revenue, such as blackhat Search Engine
Optimization (SEO). We leave a detailed investigation of
changes in spamming trends for future work.
3.4 Relations Between the Actors
In this section, we discuss the relations between the dif-
ferent parties involved in the spam delivery process: email
harvesters, spammers, and botmasters.
First, we try to understand how many spammers con-
tacted the spamtrap system. The basic relations are re-
ported in Table 5. As we mentioned, we consider a speciﬁc
spam campaign as being indicative of a single spammer.
However, a spammer might perform multiple spam cam-
paigns, either at the same time, or at two diﬀerent points
in time. We consider two campaigns as being carried out
by the same spammer if both the botnets or MTAs and the
email lists used to carry out the two campaigns are the same.
Interestingly, all the botnets that we observed were used
by a single spammer each. Lethic and Kelihos carried out
a single spam campaign, while Cutwail carried out two dif-
ferent campaigns, at two distinct points in time. However,
