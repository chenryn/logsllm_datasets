User: How to strengthen the security of Linux system to prevent it from being attacked by hackers?
Assistant: 1. Update system patches: Update system patches in time to ensure system security and reduce the chance of exploiting vulnerabilities. 2. Delete unnecessary services and software: When installing a Linux system, some services and software are often installed by default, such as FTP, Telnet and other services. These services will increase the risk of system being attacked. Therefore, it is recommended to remove unnecessary services and software and keep only necessary services and software. 3. Disable root remote login: By restricting root remote login, you can prevent hackers from using the default password to attack the server. 4. Install a firewall: Installing a firewall can effectively prevent unauthorized network access. Firewalls can be configured using tools such as iptables or firewalld. 5. Strengthen the password policy: Setting a strong password policy can prevent hackers from attacking the system by cracking passwords violently. For example, set password length, password complexity, password validity period, etc. 6. Configure SELinux: SELinux is a mandatory access control mechanism that can limit the permissions of processes and prevent malicious processes from attacking. 7. Enable log management: Centralized management of system logs can detect abnormal events and security threats in time. 8. Use encrypted transmission protocols: use encrypted transmission protocols (such as SSH, HTTPS, etc.) to protect the transmission security of sensitive information. 9. Regularly back up data: Regularly backing up data is an important means of restoring the system, which can prevent data loss and unrecoverable situations after being attacked. 10. Use security software: You can use some security software to check system risks and fix vulnerabilities, such as ClamAV, Nessus, etc.
