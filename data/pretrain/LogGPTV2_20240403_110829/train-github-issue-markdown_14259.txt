# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
In some rare instances, and I have reported this via Windows Feedback, a
window can get stuck outside of the visible desktop. The label in the taskbar
may or may not be visible ( I have it set to only show from current window )
regardless of setting - this is likely due to how far off-screen it is or it
could be outside the bounds of the mirrored L shape I use for my desktop
environment and Windows may thing it is in a top-left monitor which doesn't
exist, or somewhere else.
In these rare instances, WIN + Arrow does NOT let you move the window back
onto any normal monitor.
Because Shortcut Guide draws the window which is selected, fully even if off
screen, allow us to drag it while holding alt while this screen is up.
In most cases we can target the window, but the win + arrow system breaks in
this rare instance. Allowing us to drag within the Win popup would help. In
some cases, restarting the application does NOT fix the positioning of it
either. In these instances, unplugging a monitor, or temporarily disabling it
can help recover the window.
It doesn't happen often, but when it does it is more than a minor annoyance.
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
While holding WIN key, since only the selected window is drawn fully, even if
off-screen, allow us to move it with the mouse by dragging it.
