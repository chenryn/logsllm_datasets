Hi all,

I have been investigating the source of some segmentation faults (segfaults) that I encountered while using the `linkage` function in `scipy.cluster.hierarchy`. With the assistance of our cluster's IT specialist, Chris Walker, I have identified the root cause.

In the `linkage` function within `hierarchy.c`, the variables `n`, `np`, and `npc2` are declared as `int` types. When `n` is set to a large value, such as 50,000 (which is the case with my input files), the value of `NCHOOSE2(n)` overflows. This overflow results in a negative number of bytes being requested, causing `malloc` to return a null pointer and leading to a segfault.

To verify this, you can uncomment the debug message at line 461, which will confirm the issue.

To resolve this problem, the data types for `n`, `np`, and `npc2` should be changed to `long int` or a similar type that can accommodate larger input matrices.

Thank you!

Best regards,  
Uri
