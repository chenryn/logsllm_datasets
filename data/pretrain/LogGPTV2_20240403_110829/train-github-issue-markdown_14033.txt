Hi all,
I have been looking for the source of some segfaults I have been getting when
trying to use the linkage function in scipy.cluster.hierarchy, and I finally
found the reason (with the help of our cluster's IT person, Chris Walker).
In the 'linkage' function in hierarchy.c, the three variables `n`, `np`, and
`npc2`, are declared as int types. However, if `n=50000`, which is the case
with my input files, then the value of NCHOOSE2(n) overflows, leading `malloc`
to return a null pointer because the requested number of bytes is negative.
If you uncomment the debug message at l. 461, you will find this to be true.
These three variables should be changed to be long ints, or something similar,
to accomodate larger input matrices.
Thanks!  
Uri
