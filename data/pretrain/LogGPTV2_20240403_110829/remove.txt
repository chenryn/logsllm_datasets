remove
Removes a drive letter or mount point from the volume with focus. If the all parameter is used, all current drive letters and mount points are removed. If no drive letter or mount point is specified, then DiskPart removes the first drive letter or mount point it encounters.
The remove command can also be used to change the drive letter associated with a removable drive. You can't remove the drive letters on system, boot, or paging volumes. In addition, you can't remove the drive letter for an OEM partition, any GPT partition with an unrecognized GUID, or any of the special, non-data, GPT partitions such as the EFI system partition.
Note
A volume must be selected for the remove command to succeed. Use the select volume command to select a disk and shift the focus to it.
Syntax
remove [{letter= | mount= [all]}] [noerr]
Parameters
Parameter
