RSVP uses the specified key chain to authenticate each RSVP message exchanged with that set of RSVP neighbors after the association is configured. Subsequently the specified ACL has been reconfigured such that the key chain association is no longer valid for one or more RSVP neighbors in the set. This causes RSVP to search the configuration for another suitable key chain to use with those neighbors. If no such key chain is found RSVP will no longer be able to provide authentication for messages exchanged with those RSVP neighbors. This causes RSVP to discard RSVP messages from that set of neighbors. Because this may ultimately lead to loss of RSVP functionality with those neighbors RSVP generates this system message. This system message may also be generated if the ACL is subsequently changed so that it re-associates RSVP neighbors with the specified key chain. If RSVP is not using another key chain for the set of RSVP neighbors specified by the ACL RSVP will begin using the specified key chain to exchange authenticated RSVP messages with that set of RSVP neighbors potentially restoring RSVP functionality with those neighbors."
