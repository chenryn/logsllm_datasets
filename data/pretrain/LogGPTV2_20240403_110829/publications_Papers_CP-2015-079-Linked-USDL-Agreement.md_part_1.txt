**Abstract:**
As the use of web services becomes more prevalent, the formalization of contracts and legal aspects between providers and consumers is essential. Current proposals for modeling service level agreements (SLAs) often focus on technical aspects, lack semantic clarity, and do not adhere to web principles. These limitations hinder adoption, automatic processing, and effective sharing of agreements. Linked USDL Agreement is a Linked Data-based semantic model that extends Linked USDL to describe and share service agreements. This model provides domain-independent means for capturing SLAs, ensuring semantic consistency and addressing heterogeneity issues. By leveraging Linked Data principles, Linked USDL Agreement facilitates the discovery, interpretation, reuse, and management of SLAs in online service transactions. This paper presents the design, evaluation, and tooling support for Linked USDL Agreement.

### 1. Introduction

Despite the importance of services in developed economies and the widespread adoption of e-commerce, most service transactions are still conducted through traditional, often manual, means. Activities such as searching for services, understanding their characteristics, and customizing contracts with service level guarantees are typically performed manually. The vision of a web of services that complements existing brick-and-mortar services has led to the development of conceptual models and prototypes like e3Service, USDL, and Linked USDL. These contributions aim to support the automated, open, and scalable trading of services over the web.

Recently, USDL and its evolution, Linked USDL, have emerged as versatile tools for capturing formal service descriptions, including participants, distribution channels, interactions, and resources. However, these models underestimated the need for openness, flexibility, and extensibility. To address these limitations, Linked USDL was designed to provide a comprehensive, flexible, and web-centric solution for describing services.

### 2. Related Work

**USDL [5]:**
USDL is a comprehensive approach for describing services for automated processing, covering various aspects such as interfaces, pricing models, SLAs, and legal issues. Despite its comprehensiveness, USDL lacks the necessary openness and extensibility to fully support the diverse range of services available today.

**WSLA and WS-Agreement:**
These specifications, introduced by IBM and the Global Grid Forum, respectively, are prominent in the industry but primarily focus on technical aspects and lack semantic clarity. They also do not fully cover the lifecycle activities of SLAs, such as negotiation, creation, and monitoring.

**Linked USDL:**
Linked USDL builds on USDL, incorporating lessons learned and integrating research on Semantic Web Services, business ontologies, and Linked Data. It aims to promote trading at web scale by adopting Linked Data principles and using lightweight formal ontology representation languages to capture the semantics of services and related entities.

### 3. Requirements and Use Case

We have identified several key requirements for modeling service level agreements, which are reflected in a motivating scenario in the cloud computing domain:

**A. Requirements:**

1. **Shared Meaning of Content:**
   Effective trading requires that service providers and customers understand each other. Descriptions must be based on a shared format or schema and expressed in mutually understandable terms. Previous SLA languages, such as WSLA and WS-Agreement, only partially meet this requirement. Linked Data, on the other hand, supports the publication, discovery, and interpretation of schemas and content in a machine-understandable form.

2. **Open, Web-based Solution:**
   To promote adoption and enable the sharing and processing of SLA descriptions online, the technological approach should be open, allowing anyone to publish and exploit such descriptions. It should also be extensible to address unanticipated needs and scenarios. Our approach embraces web principles and technologies to provide a highly interoperable and scalable solution.

3. **SLA Lifecycle Automation:**
   The negotiation and creation of SLAs are crucial activities in the SLA lifecycle. Other activities include validity checking, conformance, and monitoring, which aim to detect contract conflicts and breaches. Automating these activities is essential for efficiency and accuracy. Our solution supports the automation of SLA validation and violation detection.

**B. Cloud Computing Services Use Case:**

Cloud computing has emerged as a cost-effective and efficient way to provision computing services on demand. Businesses can dynamically use external services, reducing operating and maintenance costs and supporting high scalability. Cloud computing architectures are typically divided into four layers: hardware, infrastructure, platform, and application. Each layer offers various services depending on user needs. For example, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides infrastructure resources such as servers and virtual machines. Examples of IaaS providers include Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.

### 4. Modeling Service Agreements

Based on the identified requirements and driven by the competency questions discussed, we designed an agreement module integrated with the Linked USDL family of vocabularies. The Linked USDL Agreement module is publicly available on GitHub, including the use cases presented in this paper.

To provide a shared meaning of SLAs, our model uses formal ontology representation languages to handle the structural and semantic heterogeneity of current SLAs. This ensures that SLAs are unambiguously defined and can be processed automatically.

### 5. Evaluation

We evaluated our proposal in a cloud computing scenario, comparing its expressiveness with existing models. The results show that Linked USDL Agreement effectively captures the semantics of SLAs and addresses the heterogeneity issues found in existing specifications. Additionally, we demonstrate a concrete tool that helps model and check the validity of agreements.

### 6. Tooling Support

Our tooling support includes a reference implementation and validation methods for essential SLA analysis. This tooling enables users to discover, interpret, reuse, and manage SLAs involved in any service transaction, thereby facilitating the automated processing and effective sharing of agreements.

### 7. Conclusions and Future Work

In conclusion, Linked USDL Agreement provides a robust, domain-independent, and semantically rich model for capturing and sharing SLAs. By adhering to web principles and leveraging Linked Data, it addresses the limitations of existing SLA models and supports the automated, open, and scalable trading of services. Future work will focus on further refining the model and expanding its applicability to a broader range of service domains.
