A Study of MVNO Data Paths and Performance
89
The ﬁgure illustrates large performance diﬀerences and unique behaviors
between carriers. Some MVNOs appear to mimic the underlying base carrier,
while others behave in drastically diﬀerent ways. Perhaps the most interesting
performance is seen on carriers A and A-1. Carrier A experiences vastly diﬀerent
round trip times between diﬀerent CDN locations. Additionally, carrier A favors
CDN sites (Dallas, Seattle, Los Angeles) that have the slowest median RTT
compared to the other locations. The latency to Los Angeles servers is the sec-
ond longest, despite Los Angeles being the data center nearest our measurement
location of Santa Barbara. Carrier A-1 (Fig. 2(b)) displays the broadest range
of RTT values across all CDN sites, and also favors servers located in Dallas,
TX. However, carrier A-1’s second and third most popular locations are Chicago
and New York, respectively. We believe these results are due to A-1 being a full
MVNO; thus, they employ their own core infrastructure and have service and
peering arrangements independent from the base carrier A.
Carriers B and B-1 (Fig. 2(c) and (d)), on the other hand, perform more sim-
ilarly in both latency measurements and preferred destinations. In fact, MVNO
B-1 slightly outperforms the base MNO in terms of RTT in our experiments.
Both carriers tend to route traﬃc toward Los Angeles. Los Angeles also tends
to correspond to the lowest RTT values for both carriers. The striking similarity
can be explained as carrier B-1 is a ‘light MVNO,’ thus B and B-1 use the same
infrastructure to handle client traﬃc. In this regard, it stands to argue that cus-
tomers considering carriers B and B-1 are essentially choosing between the same
service when it comes to connecting to our speciﬁed CDN sites.
Carriers C and C-1 are quite diﬀerent from one another in terms of perfor-
mance even though they favor the same three data center locations. Interest-
ingly, carrier C (Fig. 2(e)) routes the highest percentage of its traﬃc to servers
in Los Angeles, which achieve highly variable RTT values (seemingly bimodal).
We speculate that this result is due to the carrier load-balancing ﬂows across
dissimilar paths. Latency values on carrier C-1 (Fig. 2(f)) are rather consistent
to all CDN locations, with higher RTTs overall compared with carrier C. Car-
rier D (Fig. 2(g)) experiences the lowest network latencies overall. This carrier
tends to favor CDN servers located in San Jose, CA, which also has the lowest
median RTT value for carrier D. MVNO carrier D-1 (Fig. 2(h)) shows the most
