title:blackhat:us-20 Election Security: Securing America's Future 
The United States Government is intensely focused on election security and is working together with election partners better than ever before. The Department of Homeland Securityâ€™s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is leading the federal effort to support state and local officials in their important mission to secure elections in 2020. We are sharing intelligence, resources, support and cybersecurity services to secure election infrastructure against malicious activity.Since 2017, federal, state, local and private sector partners have been building up our defenses and preparing for the 2020 elections. We know this election will be a target and the bad guys are still out there, but we are trained, exercised and ready.While preparing for the threats that we knew about, our nation has been confronting another threat in the form of a pandemic. This has forced election officials to make quick operational decisions determining how to run elections in the time of COVID-19. We have had to quickly adapt and provide support and resources as officials look for safe, healthy and secure ways to ensure that elections continue to take place.
