Title: Black Hat US-20: Election Security - Safeguarding America's Future

The United States Government is deeply committed to election security and is collaborating more effectively than ever with its election partners. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) of the Department of Homeland Security is spearheading the federal initiative to assist state and local officials in securing the 2020 elections. CISA is providing intelligence, resources, support, and cybersecurity services to protect election infrastructure from malicious activities.

Since 2017, federal, state, local, and private sector partners have been bolstering our defenses and preparing for the 2020 elections. We are well aware that this election will be a target, and that adversaries remain active. However, we are well-trained, prepared, and ready to face these challenges.

While addressing known threats, our nation has also had to confront an unprecedented challenge in the form of the COVID-19 pandemic. This has required election officials to make rapid operational decisions on how to conduct elections safely and securely during the pandemic. CISA has swiftly adapted to provide the necessary support and resources, ensuring that elections can proceed in a manner that is both safe and secure.
