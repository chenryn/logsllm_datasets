The class `AnimatedBuilder` should have its name replaced. As it is not
related to animation in reality.
For example, the following is possible :
    final valueNotifier = ValueNotifier(0);
    AnimatedBuilder(
      animation: valueNotifier,
      builder: (context, _) {
        return Text(valueNotifier.value.toString());
      },
    )
Same goes for `ScrollController`, ...
I suggest to rename it to `ListenableBuilder` as it makes more sense.
