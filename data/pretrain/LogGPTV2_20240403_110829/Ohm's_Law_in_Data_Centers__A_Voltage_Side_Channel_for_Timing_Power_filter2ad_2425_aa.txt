ABSTRACT
Maliciously-injected power load, a.k.a. power attack, has recently
surfaced as a new egregious attack vector for dangerously com-
promising the data center availability. This paper focuses on the
emerging threat of power attacks in a multi-tenant colocation data
center, an important type of data center where multiple tenants
house their own servers and share the power distribution system.
Concretely, we discover a novel physical side channel — a volt-
age side channel — which leaks the benign tenants’ power usage
information at runtime and helps an attacker precisely time its
power attacks. The key idea we exploit is that, due to the Ohm’s
Law, the high-frequency switching operation (40 ∼ 100kHz) of the
power factor correction circuit universally built in today’s server
power supply units creates voltage ripples in the data center power
lines. Importantly, without overlapping the grid voltage in the fre-
quency domain, the voltage ripple signals can be easily sensed by
the attacker to track the benign tenants’ runtime power usage and
precisely time its power attacks. We evaluate the timing accuracy
of the voltage side channel in a real data center prototype, demon-
strating that the attacker can extract benign tenants’ power pattern
with a great accuracy (correlation coefficient = 0.90+) and utilize
64% of all the attack opportunities without launching attacks ran-
domly or consecutively. Finally, we highlight a few possible defense
strategies and extend our study to more complex three-phase power
distribution systems used in large multi-tenant data centers.

1 INTRODUCTION
In the age of cloud computing and Internet of Things, data centers
have experienced an exponential growth at all scales and unde-
niably become mission-critical infrastructures without which our
society cannot function. In fact, even a single data center outage
can egregiously affect our day-to-day life. For example, an outage
in Delta Airlines’ data center in 2016 stranded tens of thousands of
passengers in transit, costing more than 150 million U.S. dollars [1].
Moreover, a recent survey shows that unplanned data center-wide
outages caused by malicious attacks have increased by 11 times
from 2010 to 2016 [2]. Thus, securing data centers against attacks
has been of paramount importance.
While data center’s cyber security has been extensively inves-
tigated [3–5], a much less studied security aspect — power infras-
tructure security — has also emerged as an equally, if not more,
important concern. Even worse, besides being afflicted with random
system failures, data center power infrastructures are also increas-
ingly becoming a target for malicious attacks due to the criticality of
their hosted services [2, 6]. Concretely, recent studies [7–11] have
found and successfully demonstrated that an attacker can inject
malicious power loads (referred to as power attacks) to overload
the data center power infrastructure capacity, thus creating more
frequent data center outages. Such power attacks are achieved by
increasing the attacker’s own server power usage [8, 11] and/or
sending more workloads to the target data center [9, 10].
The primary reason for data centers’ vulnerability to power
attacks stems from the common practice of power capacity over-
subscription. Data center power infrastructures are very expensive
(and sometimes impossible because of local grid capacity or other
constraints) to build to accommodate the growing demand, costing
10 ∼ 25 dollars per watt of power capacity delivered to servers and
taking up 25 ∼ 60% of an operator’s total cost of ownership over a
15-year lifespan [12–15]. As a consequence, to maximize utilization
of existing power infrastructures, data centers (even Facebook and
Google data centers [14, 16]) commonly oversubscribe their power
capacity by housing more servers than can be supported. The cur-
rent industry average is to oversubscribe the infrastructure by 120%
(i.e., provisioning 100kW power capacity to servers whose total
power can reach 120kW) [11, 17], and recent research [9, 13, 14] has
suggested even more aggressive oversubscription. The rationale
for oversubscription is statistical multiplexing: not all servers peak
their power usage simultaneously. Additionally, various techniques
(e.g., throttling CPU and halting services [14, 15, 18, 19]) have been
proposed to handle the very rare, albeit possible, power capacity
overload resulting from oversubscription.
Nonetheless, power attacks, especially maliciously timed attacks
[7, 8, 11], can alter the servers’ total power usage and create frequent
power capacity overloads. Despite safeguards (e.g., infrastructure re-
dundancy), power attacks at best invoke power capping more often
In this paper, we focus on the emerging threat of power attacks
in a multi-tenant colocation data center (also called colocation
or multi-tenant data center), an important but less studied type
of data centers [20]. A multi-tenant data center is a shared data
center facility, in which multiple companies/organizations (each
as a tenant) houses their own physical servers and the data center
operator is responsible for providing reliable power and cooling
to tenants’ servers. Even large companies, like Google and Apple
[21, 22], lease multi-tenant data center capacities to complement
their own data centers.
Compared to an owner-operated data center whose operator
can perform power capping/throttling to mitigate power attacks,
a multi-tenant data center is more vulnerable to power attacks,
because the data center operator has no control over tenants’ power
usage. Alternatively, the operator of a multi-tenant data center
sets contractual constraints: each tenant can continuously use a
certain fraction (usually 80%) of its subscribed power capacity, but
can only use its full subscribed power capacity on an occasional
basis; non-compliance can result in forcible power cuts [11, 23].
Therefore, to launch successful power attacks while meeting the
contractual constraint in a multi-tenant data center, a malicious
tenant (attacker) must precisely time its power attacks: it needs to
increase its server power to the full capacity only at moments when
the benign tenants are also using a high power [8, 11]. Nonetheless,
a key challenge for the attacker to precisely time its power attacks
is that it does not know benign tenants’ power usage at runtime.
Importantly, attack opportunities (i.e., benign tenants’ high power
usage moments) are highly intermittent, making random attacks
unlikely to be successful (Fig. 16 in Section 5.2).
than otherwise, significantly degrading application performances
(due to, e.g., CPU throttling [9, 14]). More importantly, they signif-
icantly compromise the data center availability and create more
frequent outages, which can lead to catastrophic consequences (see
Delta Airlines’ example [1]).
In order to achieve a good timing of power attacks, we discover
a novel physical side channel — voltage side channel — which
leaks information about benign tenants’ power usage at runtime.
Concretely, we find that a power factor correction (PFC) circuit
is almost universally built in today’s server power supply units
to shape server’s current draw following the sinusoidal voltage
signal wave and hence improve the power factor (i.e., reducing
reactive power that performs no real work) [24]. The PFC circuit
includes a pulse-width modulation (PWM) that switches on and
off at a high frequency (40 ∼ 100kHz) to regulate the current.
This switching operation creates high-frequency current ripples
which, due to the Ohm’s Law (i.e., voltage is proportional to cur-
rent given a resistance) [25], generate voltage ripples along the
power line from which the server draws current. Importantly, the
high-frequency voltage ripple becomes more prominent as a server
consumes more power and can be transmitted over the data center
power line network without interferences from the nominal grid
voltage frequency (50/60Hz). As a consequence, the attacker can
easily sense its supplied voltage signal and extract benign tenants’
power usage information from the voltage ripples.
We build a prototype that represents an edge multi-tenant data
center [26] to demonstrate the effectiveness of our discovered volt-
age side channel in terms of timing attacks. Our results show even
Figure 1: Data center power infrastructure with an attacker.
though the attacker restricts itself from launching continuous at-
tacks to meet the data center operator’s contractual limit, it can
still successfully utilize more than 64% of the available attack op-
portunities with a precision rate of 50%. If attacks can be launched
consecutively, the attacker can even detect 80+% of attack opportu-
nities. Importantly, the attacker’s total cost is just a small fraction
(3% ∼ 16% in our study) of the resulting financial loss. Next, we
extend our study to a three-phase power distribution system used in
large multi-tenant data centers. Finally, we highlight a few defense
strategies (including direct current power distribution, jamming
signals, power infrastructure resilience, and attacker identification)
and discuss their limitations in practice.
2 PRELIMINARIES ON POWER ATTACKS
In this section, we provide preliminaries on power attacks, highlight-
ing the importance of multi-tenant data center, the vulnerability
and impact of power attacks, and limitations of the prior work.
2.1 Overview of Multi-Tenant Data Centers
Importance of multi-tenant data centers. Multi-tenant coloca-
2.1.1
tion data centers, also commonly called multi-tenant data centers
or colocations, are a critical segment of the data center industry,
accounting for as much as five times the energy consumption by
Google-type owner-operated data centers combined altogether [20].
A multi-tenant data center significantly differs from a multi-
tenant cloud: in a multi-tenant cloud (e.g., Amazon), the cloud
operator owns the physical servers while renting out virtualized
resources (e.g., virtual machines) to cloud users; in a multi-tenant
data center, the data center operator only owns the data center
facility and physical power/cooling infrastructures, whereas tenants
manage their own physical servers in shared spaces.
There are more than 2,000 large multi-tenant data centers in the
U.S. alone, serving almost all industry sectors that even include
large IT companies (e.g., Apple, which houses 25% of its servers in
leased multi-tenant data centers) [22, 27]. Importantly, the multi-
tenant data center industry is experiencing a double-digit growth
to meet the surging demand [28].
Moreover, many emerging Internet of Things workloads, such as
augmented reality and assisted driving, are hosted in geo-distributed
edge multi-tenant data centers in proximity of the data sources for
latency minimization. For example, Vapor IO, a data center opera-
tor, plans to build thousands of edge multi-tenant data centers in
wireless towers [29, 30].
2.1.2 Data center power infrastructure. Typically, data centers em-
ploy a tiered power infrastructure as illustrated in Fig. 1. An unin-
terrupted power supply (UPS) takes the grid voltage as input and
UPSPDUATSUtilityGeneratorAttackerBenignTenantsoutputs voltage to the lower-tier power distribution unit (PDU).
The PDU acts as a local power distribution hub and delivers power
to server/racks. Each infrastructure has a power capacity protected
by a circuit breaker. An automatic transfer switch (ATS) will switch
to the backup generator (if any) during grid outages.
The power infrastructure shown in Fig. 1 represents an edge
multi-tenant data center where the total power capacity is small
(usually in the order of 10+kW or less) and each tenant houses a few
servers in a shared server rack. In Section 6 and Appendix H, we
also show (three-phase) power infrastructures used in large multi-
tenant data centers where an individual tenant houses at least one
dedicated server rack and the data center operator oversubscribes its
more expensive upper-level PDUs each with 40 ∼ 200kW capacity.
for a medium-size 1MW data center experiencing power attacks for
only 3.5% of the time, a total financial loss of 3.5 ∼ 15.6 million U.S.
dollars can be incurred per year. The financial loss is incurred not
only by tenants which experience service outages, but also by the
data center operator which loses its capital expense in strengthening
the infrastructure resilience (let alone the reputation damage and
high customer churn rate).
More importantly, the attacker only needs to spend a tiny fraction
(as low as 3%) of the total loss, thus providing strong motivations
for malicious tenants (e.g., organized crime groups that try to bring
down services and create societal chaos, the victim data center’s
competitor, etc.) [8]. Interested readers are referred to [8, 11] for a
detailed cost analysis of power attacks.
2.2 Vulnerability and Impact of Power Attacks
As stated in Section 1, the common practice of power capacity over-
subscription improves the utilization of power infrastructures, but
