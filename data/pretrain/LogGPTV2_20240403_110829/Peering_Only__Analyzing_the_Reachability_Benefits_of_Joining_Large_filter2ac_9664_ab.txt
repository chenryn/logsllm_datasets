### Traffic Volume and Direct Peering

High traffic volumes often necessitate direct peering sessions on dedicated physical infrastructure with guaranteed capacity. This form of interconnection typically involves monetary compensation for specific Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). Although private peering keeps the peering policies of an Autonomous System (AS) hidden and often provides dedicated capacity, it can still be affected by outages, such as when an entire colocation facility goes down. According to Giotsas et al., this is not uncommon, with 160 outages reported over five years [32].

### Cloud and Content Provider Connectivity

Cloud and content providers frequently establish peering at hundreds of physically distinct locations [11] and connect to thousands of different networks [6]. While they often require private peering connections, they may also rely on bilateral peering to directly connect with as many eyeball ASes as possible [24] or to achieve latency improvements of tens of milliseconds over their transit providers [69]. Consequently, these providers dominate the peering LAN traffic, as demonstrated by Cardona et al. [19] for two medium-sized Internet Exchange Points (IXPs). To facilitate these connections, colocation facilities have introduced cloud exchanges—specific ports that provide virtual private interconnection (VPI) to multiple cloud service providers within the same facility [79].

### Identifying Peering Partners

Many network operators use PeeringDB, a community-driven database, to identify potential peering partners [62]. PeeringDB categorizes peering policies into four types:
1. **Open**: Networks that peer with any other network.
2. **Selective**: Networks that will peer under certain conditions, such as minimum traffic volume or location.
3. **Restrictive**: Networks that already have an existing set of peers and require strong, convincing arguments to establish a new peering connection.
4. **No Peering**: Networks that do not engage in peering and rely entirely on transit [58].

Most entries in PeeringDB are of the 'open' type, but the database is known to contain some inaccurate entries [45,74]. Additionally, many small networks, especially in developing regions, do not register in PeeringDB [45].

### Data Sets Overview

#### Main Data Sets
- **PeeringDB Snapshots (2010/08/01–2021/06/01, Monthly)**: A community-maintained database containing information about IXPs, colocation facilities, peering LANs, and networks [62]. CAIDA produces monthly snapshots of this database [17].
- **Route Server Snapshots (2021/06/06–2021/06/21, Once)**: We compiled Route Server snapshots for the largest peering LANs of eight major IXPs, obtained via personal contacts over 15 days.
- **IXP Traffic Data (2021/05/01–2021/06/07)**: IPFIX traffic captures from one of the largest European IXPs, sampled at a rate of 1:10k flows, encompassing all traffic exchanged via the peering LAN.
- **ISP Traffic Data (2021/06/10)**: A single workday of egress traffic captured from all border routers of a large European eyeball network, sampled at a rate of 1:1K packets.
- **Domain-Based Prefix Top List (2021/04/30)**: A recently recomputed domain-based prefix top list from Naab et al. [55], which relies on Umbrella’s domain top list [25] for input.

#### Orthogonal Data Sets
- **Maxmind GeoLite2 Snapshot (2021/06/01)**: Used to geolocate Route Server prefixes, achieving near-perfect continent-level predictions [52].
- **CAIDA’s AS Relationships Snapshot (2021/06/01)**: Monthly snapshots of business relationships inferred by ASRank based on routing data from RouteViews and RIPE/RIS [14,47,61,56].
- **CAIDA’s IP-to-AS Mapping Snapshot (2021/06/10)**: Daily IP to AS mappings based on selected Route Views collectors [18].
- **CAIDA’s AS-to-Org Mapping Snapshot (2021/04/01)**: Quarterly snapshots of AS-to-Organization mappings generated from WHOIS databases [16].

### Multilateral Peering Analysis

We begin our analysis with multilateral peering, focusing on Route Server snapshots from the largest peering LANs of various IXPs. Out of ten IXPs, Nl-IX and EPIX did not fulfill our request. The eight Route Server snapshots, taken between June 6th and June 21st, 2021, contain the entire routing information base for each session. Our key findings include:

- **Similarity Across Large Route Servers**: They share a similar distribution of routes per peer and a majority of reachable prefixes and IPs, indicating that joining additional Route Servers has a negligible impact on reachability.
- **Limited In-Continent Routes**: Due to the growing trend of remote peering, Route Servers provide a limited number of in-continent routes.
- **Lengthy AS Paths**: Most routes contain at least three hops, with members often preferring one-hop Route Server routes.

#### Consistency in Route Distribution

Our snapshots show that connecting to the Route Server provides routes from up to 650 IXP members. However, not all members announce the same number of prefixes. Figure 3 illustrates the number of prefixes announced by each peer per Route Server, showing strong consistency across different IXPs. For example, the top 1.5%, 10%, 30%, and 70% of Route Server peers at AMS-IX announce routes for more than 10K, 1K, 100, and 10 IPv4 (1K, 100, 20, and 5 IPv6) prefixes, respectively. Notably, 31.3% of IPv4 and 11.2% of IPv6 Route Server prefixes are not globally exported due to BGP communities controlling redistribution rules.

#### Local Traffic Localization

Initially, IXPs were established to "keep local traffic local." However, many peers now announce tens of thousands of prefixes to hundreds of millions of hosts. Figure 4 shows the AS path length for Route Server prefixes, indicating that around half of all prefixes have a shortest path containing three or more ASes. This contradicts the "keep local traffic local" idea, as local routes would likely lead directly to an access/eyeball network or indirectly via a national service provider.

To gain a more accurate perspective, we mapped visible prefixes to countries and continents using Maxmind’s GeoLite2 database [52]. Figure 5 shows the geographic distribution of Route Server prefixes, revealing that approximately two-thirds of all prefixes lead to out-of-continent hosts. This trend is influenced by the growing practice of remote peering [57].

To further investigate the correlation between path length and distance, we conducted ping measurements from a server directly connected to the switching fabric of L-IXP towards each member interface.
