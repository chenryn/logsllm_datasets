### Expected Behavior
I am using net.request. usually net.request will return set-cookie in the
response only in 200 response. In case of redirect response like 301, 304, the
set-cookie header will not be returned even though it exists on the header. It
should be returned.
### Actual Behavior
set-cookie response header is not coming in the response
