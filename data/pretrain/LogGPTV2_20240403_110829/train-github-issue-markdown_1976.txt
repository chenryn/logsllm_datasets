## ðŸš€ Feature
I would like to see a PyTorch feature to generate a dataset, ideally Pandas
DataFrame with the image name as index and lists of labels for each image.
## Motivation
For multi-label image classification, it is important to generate the dataset
from scratch given a custom datasets. Most likely, the images would be
duplicated in multiple folder if the image has multiple label, similar to how
`ImageFolder` works. Unfortunately, I have not seen any of such features
offered in most PyTorch implementation.
## Pitch
Multi-label image classification is definitely an important topic as most
images can be classified with multiple labels. It is also much easier to
implement compared to object detection if such level of detection is not
required.
## Alternatives
@SpandanMadan had proposed a working solution. I would like to clean it up and
make it consistent with PyTorch implementation.
