First, we see that
has
WebMoney
been a consistent
pay-
and reliable
ment provider
for
MaxiDed, basically
from the start. Other
instruments
from
that period proved
more
problematic.
For example, Paypal
became much more
difﬁcult
to use in
the course of 2015
and was abandoned
completely in early
2018. We can see
the operators deploy-
ing new ones and also abandoning some of them again.
This process seems to suggest responding to potential or
manifest disruptions via payment providers. Consistent with
this interpretation is the increase in options to pay with
cryptocurrencies. We ﬁrst see a major shift to bitcoin at
the end of 2013. Then, around the end of 2017, MaxiDed
added 8 new cryptocurrencies. A preference to move to
cryptocurrencies was also observed in backend data, where
MaxiDed’s operators maintained an explicit preference order
for the different payment methods.
Figure 8: Payment instrument monthly
transaction volume
tomers used only one payment method. Disruption of
MaxiDed’s payment ﬂow via WebMoney would have been a
viable chokepoint in earlier phases. The self-imposed lim-
its on using Paypal probably reﬂect the fact that those
payments were vulnerable to countermeasures by Paypal.
The shift
towards
cryptocurrency pay-
ments demonstrates
that MaxiDed rec-
ognized this depen-
dency, as well as il-
lustrates how it was
attempting to reme-
diate it. It is clear
that this shift makes
disruption more difﬁcult, though it is hard to gauge how re-
silient the bitcoin payment option actually was. This would
require a study of the blockchain and the role of currency ex-
changes, which is out of scope for this study. That being said,
the proliferation of cryptocurrency options might counteract
the vulnerabilities associated with each speciﬁc instrument.
7.5 Package Pricing
BPH businesses are typically understood as charging cus-
tomers high markup prices for allowing illicit activities and
offering protection against takedowns. There is anecdotal
evidence (e.g., [2, 5]) that suggests prices are well above
those for bonaﬁde services. Our data, however, questions this
widely-held understanding.
Figure 9: Revenue
We ﬁrst distinguished VPS packages from physical dedi-
cated servers. In each category, we then compared the distri-
bution of the monthly lease price of packages that allowed
abuse versus those that did not. The results are plotted in Fig-
ure 10a. We observe that indeed abuse-enabling servers cost
more, but the difference are modest across most of the dis-
tribution. For dedicated servers, the median price was 95.00
USD for non-BP packages and 146.00 USD for BP packages.
For virtual servers, the median prices were 25.00 USD versus
35.00 USD. These numbers suggest that customers payed a
median markup ranging from 40% to 54% for being allowed
to abuse. This includes both the fee of MaxiDed as well as
the margin of the merchant. The rest goes to the upstream
provider.
Figure 9 plots the cumulative generated revenue for the top
5 most popular payment instruments. While WebMoney had
brought in the most revenue, the total amount of bitcoin
payments was growing rapidly and poised to overtake the
leading position, until the takedown happened.
All in all, MaxiDed’s revenue was generated through
a small set of payment methods. The bulk of their cus-

Figure 10b illustrates the results
with median group prices indicated in the plot. Here, we
observe larger prices differences. The median price of the
highest risk packages are 3.5 times higher than those for the
non-abuse packages.
The limited markup seen in the lower risk packages might
reﬂect the fact that the platform has an oversupply of BP
packages. Many packages never got sold. The platform also
sets up the merchants to compete with each other. All of
this might push prices down, towards the cost of the upstream
package. Relatively low markup might also reﬂect less cost on
the side of the merchant and marketplace because of takedown.
Low prices may also be the result of MaxiDed’s business
model which pushes takedown risks to customers by requiring
prepayment.
8 Customers
Law enforcement takedowns of online anonymous markets
(a.k.a., dark markets) have targeted the platforms, the sup-
ply chains, but also the customers on these platforms, in an
attempt to disrupt the demand side. The most ambitious op-
eration was the coordinated Alphabay-Hansa market action,
which de-anonymized many merchants and buyers [23]. As
of yet, it is unclear if these actions will have any impact on
the demand for these services. Nevertheless, we will take a
closer look at the population of MaxiDed customers to under-
stand how demand has evolved over time and whether it offers
starting points for disruption.
MaxiDed’s registration data shows that 308,396 unique
users signed up to its platform. Figure 11 plots the cumulative
number of registered, active and paying users over time. We
ﬁnd three outlier events, during which a large number of users
appear to have been artiﬁcially created, that distort the num-
bers. Only 6,782 of the user population ever purchased server
packages. Of these, 4,498 users were active in the sense that
they logged into the platform’s CRM at least once after having
signed up. On average, the platform saw a daily growth of 3
user sign ups, excluding the three outlier events.
Cross referencing the user data, customer orders, and server
package data, we ﬁnd that the majority of the customers were
interested in and may have engaged in abusive activities.
This is observable
in Figure 12 (left)

the

evolution, they still had a signiﬁcant number of customers
Figure 11: User number over time
who never bought BP packages. A few years in, they attract
an increasing number of users that do buy BP packages.
At the time of its disruption, 66% of all customers ever to
register had purchased BP packages. The remaining 34% was
a mix of bonaﬁde customers and customers who may have
undertaken abusive activities on non-BP packages.
Figure 12: (left) Customer types; (right) Customer locations (XX =

Customers could specify language preferences in their pro-
ﬁle: 5,085 selected English and 1,697 selected Russian. They
were also asked to supply location information. Assuming
that user-speciﬁed locations are correct, a crude assumption,
then most users came from 3 countries, namely RU, US and
NL (see Figure 12 - right), followed by a long tail of other
countries.
9 Use and Abuse
Next, we explore server use and abuse by customers. We
examine how customers manage takedown risks transferred
to them by MaxiDed and look at the measure of last-resort,
namely blacklisting BP servers once they are detected.
In Demand Abuse Categories
9.1
Our data contains timestamps of when servers were provi-
sioned and when they were taken ofﬂine. Servers were deac-
tivated when their lease expired or when abuse complaints
caused the upstream provider to terminate the lease early.

number of

servers across var-
risk proﬁles.

sought to purchase.
After a start as a
legitimate provider,
BP servers become
dominant over time (see Figure 13). Initially, customers were
interested in spamming, operating phishing domains (which
triggered DMCA complaints), running counterfeit pharma
and gambling sites (risk proﬁle G3). Then we see a steady
growth in demand for G1: ﬁle sharing, streaming, adult con-
tent, and WAREZ forums. The rapid growth of MaxiDed, start-
ing around the end of 2014, saw a diversiﬁcation of the abuse
and an increase of VPNs and seedboxes for ﬁle sharing (G2),
shows

These shifts reﬂect a wider
trend towards commoditization of cybercrime services, such
as the provisioning of DDoS-as-a-Service [1]. At its peak,
MaxiDed administered 1,620 active BP and non-BP servers.
9.2 Abusive Server Uptime
MaxiDed and its merchants shifted the risk of takedown to
their customers. They required prepayment, offered no reim-
bursements, and provided minimal resilience support with
considerable attached “abuse fees”.

Table 4: Server lifespan statistics
How do customers deal with this risk? In essence: by choos-
ing shorter lease periods for more risky activities. Table 4 lists
the median lease periods that customers opt for across var-
ious risk groups. The more risky the abuse, i.e., the higher
the probability of a takedown, the shorter the lease time. The
table also provides statistics on the proportions of BP servers
that were prematurely terminated due to abuse complaints,
proportions of lease expirations, extensions, in addition to the
number of usage days that customers lost from termination of
their lease. Customers with the most risky activities manage
to mitigate the cost of takedown to a median of 6 lost days.
We also see that at most 23% of the BP servers were prema-
turely taken down. Most BP server ran uninterrupted for their
entire lease period. This speaks to the low rate of blacklisting,
questioning the effectiveness of this practices in disincentiviz-
ing abuse. An interesting pattern is that customers also abused
servers that did not allow abuse. 15% of these servers were
also taken down.
Overall 2,656 servers were deactivated prior to the expiry
of their lease plan. Another 6,483 active servers were deac-
tivated when they reached their normal expiry term. 5,117
servers remained active beyond their initial lease plan.
9.3 Detected Abusive Resources
We next explore a ﬁnal chokepoint: blocking the BP servers
and abusive content hosted on them once they are discovered.
We triangulated these results by looking directly at several
blacklists. We used three years of passive DNS data from Far-
sight Security’s DNSDB to identify domain based resources
on MaxiDed’s IP addresses: fully qualiﬁed domain names
(FQDNs) and 2nd-level domains (2LDs). Table 5 lists the
quantities of resources associated with MaxiDed from 2016
to 2018. This period corresponds to when MaxiDed had the
highest number of active servers. We examined the intersec-
tion between these resources and those ﬂagged or blocked
by several leading industry abuse feeds. The feeds capture
a mix of spam, phishing, malware and botnet C&C abuse.
Detailed information on these feeds is provided in Table 5.
The quantities of ﬂagged MaxiDed customer resources within
each of these abuse feeds are also listed in the table. When
no historical feed data was available, we left the cell empty.
While coverage of blacklists is known to be limited, it is
quite disappointing to see the small fraction of the abuse that
gets picked up by the feeds. This conﬁrms, with ground truth,
the observation in prior work that blacklisting is generally
ineffective in disrupting abuse.
10 Marketplace Finances
Disruption of BPH is also determined by how proﬁtable the
business is. Lower margins mean that the provider is more
vulnerable to raised operating costs in the supply chain. In
this section, we analyze MaxiDed’s revenue, costs and proﬁts.
To get a sense of the company as a whole, we include both
BP and non-BP services.
