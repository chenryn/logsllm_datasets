### Payment Methods and Their Evolution

First, it is evident that WebMoney has been a consistent and reliable payment provider for MaxiDed from the beginning. Other payment methods from that period proved to be more problematic. For example, PayPal became increasingly difficult to use starting in 2015 and was completely abandoned by early 2018. Over time, we observe the operators deploying new payment methods and subsequently abandoning some of them, suggesting a response to potential or actual disruptions via payment providers. Consistent with this interpretation, there has been an increase in options to pay with cryptocurrencies. A significant shift towards Bitcoin occurred at the end of 2013, and by the end of 2017, MaxiDed had added eight new cryptocurrencies. Backend data also indicates that MaxiDed's operators maintained a clear preference order for different payment methods.

**Figure 8: Monthly Transaction Volume by Payment Instrument**

Most customers used only one payment method. Disruption of MaxiDed’s payment flow via WebMoney would have been a viable chokepoint in earlier phases. The self-imposed limits on using PayPal likely reflect the vulnerability of these payments to countermeasures by PayPal. The shift towards cryptocurrency payments demonstrates that MaxiDed recognized this dependency and attempted to mitigate it. While this shift makes disruption more difficult, it is challenging to gauge the resilience of the Bitcoin payment option without a detailed study of the blockchain and the role of currency exchanges, which is beyond the scope of this study. However, the proliferation of cryptocurrency options may counteract the vulnerabilities associated with each specific instrument.

### Package Pricing

BPH (Bulletproof Hosting) businesses are typically understood to charge high markup prices for allowing illicit activities and offering protection against takedowns. Anecdotal evidence suggests that prices for BPH services are well above those for legitimate services. Our data, however, questions this widely-held understanding.

**Figure 9: Revenue by Payment Instrument**

We first distinguished VPS (Virtual Private Server) packages from physical dedicated servers. In each category, we compared the distribution of the monthly lease price of packages that allowed abuse versus those that did not. The results are plotted in Figure 10a. We observe that abuse-enabling servers do cost more, but the difference is modest across most of the distribution. For dedicated servers, the median price was $95.00 for non-BP packages and $146.00 for BP packages. For virtual servers, the median prices were $25.00 versus $35.00. These numbers suggest that customers paid a median markup ranging from 40% to 54% for being allowed to abuse. This includes both the fee of MaxiDed and the margin of the merchant, with the rest going to the upstream provider.

**Figure 10: Package Pricing (See Table 3 for risk group labels)**

We also compared package prices based on associated risk groups. Figure 10b illustrates the results with median group prices indicated in the plot. Here, we observe larger price differences. The median price of the highest-risk packages is 3.5 times higher than those for non-abuse packages.

The limited markup seen in lower-risk packages might reflect an oversupply of BP packages, with many packages never sold. The platform also sets up merchants to compete with each other, potentially pushing prices down towards the cost of the upstream package. Relatively low markups might also reflect lower costs on the side of the merchant and marketplace due to takedown risks. Low prices may also result from MaxiDed’s business model, which pushes takedown risks to customers by requiring prepayment.

### Customer Analysis

Law enforcement takedowns of online anonymous markets (also known as dark markets) have targeted platforms, supply chains, and customers in an attempt to disrupt the demand side. The most ambitious operation was the coordinated Alphabay-Hansa market action, which de-anonymized many merchants and buyers. As of yet, it is unclear if these actions will impact the demand for these services. Nevertheless, we will take a closer look at the population of MaxiDed customers to understand how demand has evolved over time and whether it offers starting points for disruption.

MaxiDed’s registration data shows that 308,396 unique users signed up to its platform. Figure 11 plots the cumulative number of registered, active, and paying users over time. We find three outlier events during which a large number of users appear to have been artificially created, distorting the numbers. Only 6,782 of the user population ever purchased server packages. Of these, 4,498 users were active, logging into the platform’s CRM at least once after signing up. On average, the platform saw a daily growth of 3 new user sign-ups, excluding the three outlier events.

**Figure 11: User Numbers Over Time**

Cross-referencing user data, customer orders, and server package data, we find that the majority of customers were interested in and may have engaged in abusive activities. This is observable in Figure 12 (left), which plots the cumulative number of customers, separating those who eventually purchased BP servers. In the earlier stages of MaxiDed’s evolution, they still had a significant number of customers who never bought BP packages. A few years in, they attracted an increasing number of users who did buy BP packages. At the time of its disruption, 66% of all customers who ever registered had purchased BP packages. The remaining 34% was a mix of legitimate customers and customers who may have undertaken abusive activities on non-BP packages.

**Figure 12: (left) Customer Types; (right) Customer Locations (XX = Location Not Specified)**

Customers could specify language preferences in their profile: 5,085 selected English, and 1,697 selected Russian. They were also asked to provide location information. Assuming that user-specified locations are correct, most users came from three countries: Russia (RU), the United States (US), and the Netherlands (NL), followed by a long tail of other countries.

### Use and Abuse

Next, we explore server use and abuse by customers. We examine how customers manage takedown risks transferred to them by MaxiDed and look at the measure of last-resort, namely blacklisting BP servers once they are detected.

**9.1 Demand for Abuse Categories**

Our data contains timestamps of when servers were provisioned and when they were taken offline. Servers were deactivated when their lease expired or when abuse complaints caused the upstream provider to terminate the lease early. Figure 13 plots the number of active servers across various risk profiles, showing what customers mostly sought to purchase. After starting as a legitimate provider, BP servers became dominant over time (see Figure 13). Initially, customers were interested in spamming, operating phishing domains (which triggered DMCA complaints), running counterfeit pharmaceutical and gambling sites (risk profile G3). Then, we see a steady growth in demand for G1: file sharing, streaming, adult content, and WAREZ forums. The rapid growth of MaxiDed, starting around the end of 2014, saw a diversification of abuse and an increase in VPNs and seedboxes for file sharing (G2), scanning (G4), and spoofing (G5). These shifts reflect a wider trend towards the commoditization of cybercrime services, such as the provisioning of DDoS-as-a-Service. At its peak, MaxiDed administered 1,620 active BP and non-BP servers.

**Figure 13: Active Servers Over Time**

**9.2 Abusive Server Uptime**

MaxiDed and its merchants shifted the risk of takedown to their customers by requiring prepayment, offering no reimbursements, and providing minimal resilience support with considerable attached “abuse fees.” Table 4 lists the median lease periods that customers opted for across various risk groups. The more risky the abuse, the shorter the lease time. The table also provides statistics on the proportions of BP servers that were prematurely terminated due to abuse complaints, proportions of lease expirations, extensions, and the number of usage days that customers lost from termination of their lease. Customers with the most risky activities managed to mitigate the cost of takedown to a median of 6 lost days. At most, 23% of the BP servers were prematurely taken down. Most BP servers ran uninterrupted for their entire lease period, indicating a low rate of blacklisting and questioning the effectiveness of this practice in disincentivizing abuse. An interesting pattern is that customers also abused servers that did not allow abuse, with 15% of these servers being taken down.

**Table 4: Server Lifespan Statistics**

Overall, 2,656 servers were deactivated prior to the expiry of their lease plan. Another 6,483 active servers were deactivated when they reached their normal expiry term. 5,117 servers remained active beyond their initial lease plan.

**9.3 Detected Abusive Resources**

We next explore a final chokepoint: blocking the BP servers and abusive content hosted on them once they are discovered. We triangulated these results by looking directly at several blacklists. We used three years of passive DNS data from Farsight Security’s DNSDB to identify domain-based resources on MaxiDed’s IP addresses: fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) and second-level domains (2LDs). Table 5 lists the quantities of resources associated with MaxiDed from 2016 to 2018, corresponding to when MaxiDed had the highest number of active servers. We examined the intersection between these resources and those flagged or blocked by several leading industry abuse feeds, which capture a mix of spam, phishing, malware, and botnet C&C abuse. Detailed information on these feeds is provided in Table 5. The quantities of flagged MaxiDed customer resources within each of these abuse feeds are also listed. When no historical feed data was available, we left the cell empty.

While coverage of blacklists is known to be limited, it is disappointing to see the small fraction of abuse that gets picked up by the feeds. This confirms, with ground truth, the observation in prior work that blacklisting is generally ineffective in disrupting abuse.

**Table 5: Quantities of Flagged MaxiDed Resources**

### Marketplace Finances

Disruption of BPH is also determined by the profitability of the business. Lower margins mean that the provider is more vulnerable to increased operating costs in the supply chain. In this section, we analyze MaxiDed’s revenue, costs, and profits. To get a sense of the company as a whole, we include both BP and non-BP services.
