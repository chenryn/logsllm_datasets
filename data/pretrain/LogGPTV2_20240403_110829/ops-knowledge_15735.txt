User: I recently attempted to upgrade our Python install on a CentOS server from 2.4.3 to 2.7, however it lists 2.4.3 as the newest stable release.  This is a problem because I have a Python program that requires at least 2.7 to run properly.  After contacting support they installed Python 2.7 in a separate directory, however I'm not sure how to access this version.  Anytime I try to run the python program it uses the 2.4.3 version.  I have looked into changing the PythonHome variable, but can't get it to work correctly.  Is there anything I can do via the command line or inside the program itself to specify which Python version I want to use?
Assistant: Try specifying the full path to the python executable (i.e. /opt/python27/python) rather than using a bare python command. Alternatively, place /opt/python27/ on your PATH earlier than /usr/local/bin (where the python command is presumably already present, you can check with which python).
