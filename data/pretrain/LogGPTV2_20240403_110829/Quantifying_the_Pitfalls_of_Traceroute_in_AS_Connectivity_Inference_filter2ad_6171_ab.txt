(both ‘−’ and ‘+’) patterns. Among the extra mismatch fragments, 39% are
loops. Overall, there are 12∼37% of path pairs containing one or more mismatch
fragments. And we also observe that the appearance frequency of mismatch frag-
ments follows a heavy-tailed distribution, which means that there are a small
number of mismatch fragments shared by a large number of the path pairs.
6 Inferring the Causes of Mismatch
In this section we look into causes of mismatch between BGP paths and tracer-
oute derived paths, and classify them into 7 types as described in Sec. 2. Our
classiﬁcation algorithm follows an if-then-else process, i.e. it starts by checking
whether the mismatch is of type 1, if yes then the classiﬁcation stops, otherwise
it continues and checks for type 2, and so on until it’s put in Unknown bin.
1. Divergence: These are cases where the control plane is not aligned with
the traceroute path. We detect these cases whenever the edit distance of the
mismatch fragment (i.e. the number of modifying operations), has a high
value, i.e. greater than 3 for substitute and loop patterns, or greater than 2
for missing and extra patterns. Below are two examples we ﬁnd in our data:
(a) Tunneling: The Amateur Packet Radio Network (AMPR.org) uses the
preﬁx 44/8 announced by AS7377 (UCSD) and an overlay network on
the Internet to tunnel traﬃc (including ICMP) between diﬀerent parts
of the network. So the BGP path to 44/8 ends at AS7377, while the
traceroute path comes in AS7377, travels cross the overlay network on
other ASes, and then ends in AS7377.
(b) Routing Dynamics: We observed some substitute and extra mismatch
fragments at the end of paths, where AS2512 (CalREN), the provider of
UCLA, is appended. An example is ‘= AS12969, −AS43571, +AS2512,
=$’, where AS12969 is more than 2 AS hops away from AS2152. This
happened because some of our traceroute probes were actually falling in
a routing loop within AS2152 immediately after reaching AS12969.
2. Unannounced Preﬁxes: In a substitute fragment, only ‘?’ is inserted.
3. Non-responsive Hops: In a substitute fragment, only ‘∗’ is inserted.
For each following cause, given a mismatch fragment M, we conduct the speciﬁc
tests on one or more AS pairs which are adjacent operands in M. Once one AS
pair pass the test, the corresponding cause for M is determined. Let the AS pair
be X and Y . For extra pattern, the pair is ‘+X’ and ‘= Y ’. For missing pattern,
the pair is ‘= X’ and ‘−Y ’. For substitute pattern, the pair is ‘+X’ and ‘−Y ’,
or ‘+X’ and ‘= Y ’.
4. MOAS Preﬁxes: The matching preﬁx is announced by both X and Y .
5. IXPs: X is an IXP ASN, or the IP addresses mapped to X are used in
IXPs.
6. Siblings: X and Y belong to the same sibling group.

7. Neighbors: Three types of tests are conducted: 1) According to the iPlane’s
alias list, the IP address mapped to X belongs to a router that has another
interface mapped to Y . 2) X and Y are neighbors in BGP topology. 3) X
and Y are neighbors in the topology from the IRR. The contributions of
these three tests are 18%, 77% and 5%, respectively.
Table 2 shows the fraction of cases in each class, measured in the percentages of
paths and fragments. The path values are relevant for comparison with previous
work [13,10]. We can see that the majority of mismatch cases are the result of
foreign addresses including IXPs, siblings and BGP neighbors. And over half of
mismatch fragments are due to IP addresses sharing between BGP neighbors,
that supports the view of [7]. The contribution of IXPs, siblings and MOAS only
sum up to nearly 14%, although the previous work [13,10,12] considered them
as the major causes. In addition, 6∼9% of mismatch cases are due to holes, i.e.
unannounced or non-responsive hops, in traceroute paths.
Comparing the results in units of path and fragment side by side, we note
that the fragment-based results is more robust to the monitor location and the
possible ﬂaws in cause inference than the path-based. And there are two types
of bias in path-based counting: (1) Overestimating the inﬂuence of some causes,
such as IXPs in ucla and she-cn. This is mainly because multiple paths may
often share a single point of mismatch close to the monitor. (2) Underestimating
the diﬃculty to infer causes. In Unknown bin, only about 1% of paths contain
9∼14% of fragments. About 93% of fragments in Unknown bin are at the end of
path. Most of these cases may either correspond to BGP sessions not visible in
the current BGP topology or due to misclassiﬁed Divergence cases.
7 Accuracy of Traceroute-Derived AS Connectivity
In this section we assess the accuracy of traceroute-derived AS adjacencies. Ac-
cording to our previous work [14], the BGP table of a monitor should reveal
almost all its AS neighbors over time. The BGP AS graph from UCLA IRL is
denoted by Gbgp. There are about 180 monitors providing full tables residing

in 112 diﬀerent ASes connected to 13.6K unique ASes through a total of 43K
links. Let Gtruth denote this set of AS adjacencies. A traceroute-derived AS link
X − Y is bogus, if either X or Y is in our set of 112 ASes but the link X − Y
dose not exist in Gtruth.
To evaluate the inaccuracy of traceroute-derived AS links, we inspect two
/L and Lbogus/L, where L is the number of links discovered by
bgp is the number of extra links not in Gbgp; Lbogus is the number
/L can be considered as a upper bound of the error
values: L

of bogus links. The value L
rate, while the value Lbogus/L should be seen as a lower bound of inaccuracy.
To understand how the extra links and bogus links were created, we search for
these links in our mismatch fragments and group them in the causes described
in the previous section. Table 3 shows the inaccuracy of traceroute-derived AS
topology by causes. The results from diﬀerent monitors are similar. We see that
the cause Neighbors are responsible for most of the links not seen in BGP, and
contribute to the highest chunk of bogus links.
We also verify the accuracy of the AS adjacency sets provided by Ark and
DIMES in Table 4. About 47% of AS adjacencies in the traceroute-derived
topologies are not seen in BGP. In addition, we verify that about 16% of the
traceroute AS adjacencies are false. Discarding the indirect links, that is caused
by non-responsive hops or unannounced preﬁxes, in CAIDA’s data can reduce
the fraction of bogus links from 13% to 8%. However still 31% of the extra links
not seen in BGP are actually bogus (Lbogus/L ¯bgp).

8 Conclusion
In this paper we develop a systematic approach to identify and classify errors
in AS paths inferred from traceroute using the LPM method. Our results shed
light into the major pitfalls of traceroute-based AS topology measurement and
show the limitations of publicly available AS topologies derived from traceroute.
Since most of the inconsistencies originate from IP address sharing between
BGP neighbors, we believe that building an accurate database of router interface
aliases can bring signiﬁcant improvement to the accuracy of the router path to
AS path conversion process, and this is part of our future work.
