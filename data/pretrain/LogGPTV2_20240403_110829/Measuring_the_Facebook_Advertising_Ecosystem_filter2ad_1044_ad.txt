(3) A non-trivial fraction (12%) of ads are part of Retargeting,
meaning an advertiser is trying to reach a user who had
previously interacted with them.
(4) While a small share of ads (3%) are part of P II − based
targeting (note that this targeting type has one of the lowest
precedences and it is underestimated), a large number of users
(79%) have been targeted with at least one P II − based ad
(i.e., there exists at least one advertiser that knows the email
or the phone number or some other identiﬁable information
about the user). To date, there is no veriﬁcation process of
how advertisers gathered such information and lists of phone
numbers and emails can be easily bought online [10]. It is
important to give special attention to this targeting mechanism
especially because it has been shown that it can be used for
discriminatory advertising [38] and has been exploited to leak
users’ personal information [40].
(5) Surprisingly, Social neighborhood targeting only accounts
for a very small fraction of ads (2%). This is somewhat unex-
pected as this is a marketing strategy for which social media
have a competitive advantage over traditional advertising.
In addition, Table IX presents the frequency of each
targeting type in terms of ads, advertisers and users in Europe,
North America, Brazil, and the rest of the world.9 We see that:
(1) Data brokers and PII-based targeting types seem more
frequent in North America, reaching 2% and 6% of the ads,
respectively (compared to 1% and 2% in Europe). PII-based
targeting types seem more prominent among users as well:
81% of our North American users have received such ads,
while there only 73% Europeans have. This might reﬂect the
differences regarding privacy laws and handling of personal
data in general [11].
(2) European advertisers appear to use Retargeting and Looka-
like audiences less frequently and Age/gender/location more
frequently. This is intriguing as it might show that current
privacy discussions and laws [11] have an impact on European
advertisers’ strategies.
2) Persistent vs. one-shot targeting: We deﬁne a persistent
advertiser as an advertiser that has advertised to at least one
user over a period of more than two weeks and with more
9Note that we assume that the precedence we observe in explanations is
consistent across countries.
than ﬁve ads; we similarly deﬁne a one-shot advertiser as an
advertiser that targeted all users no more than once.
Impact of biases and limitations in the dataset: In order not
to overestimate the fraction of one-shot advertisers we report
results on only advertisers for users for which we have more
than 2 weeks of data. We also looked at one-shot advertisers
for users for which we have more than 4 and 6 weeks of data
and the results are similar so we omit them.
Our results show that the large majority of advertisers
(65%) are one-shot and only a small minority (3%) are ob-
served persistently targeting users (64% and 4%, respectively,
for DATA-BRAZIL). The vast majority (88%) of persistent
advertisers have persistently targeted only one or two users;
however, some have targeted persistently up to 17 users in
DATA-WORLDWIDE and 63 in DATA-BRAZIL (these include
Facebook, Netﬂix, Google, and Udemy). Table X compares the
characteristics of the two types of advertisers for both datasets
combined. We can see the following:
Popularity: In general, persistent advertisers are more popular
and are more likely to be veriﬁed, but there exist also persistent
advertisers who are niche(e.g., SEMY Awards, an organization
that gives industry awards; and Vianex-Fast-Remit, a money
transfer company with only 53 Likes).
Targeting types: We observe

ers use PII-based and Retargeting more frequently and
Age/Gender/Location less frequemently (compared to Ta-
ble VIII). For one-shot advertisers, we observe that
they
use Age/Gender/Location and Attribute-based more frequently,
and Lookalike audiences, PII-based and Retargeting less fre-
quently. Surprisingly, a large fraction (8%) of targeting types
for one-shot advertisers are Location-based and Social neigh-
borhood (compared to 4% in Table VIII).
Advertisers’ IAB categories: 10% of persistent advertisers are
part of the News and Politics IAB category (e.g., PokerGO, a
Facebook page that covers news in Poker; Vanessa Grazziotin,
a Brazilian politician; the European Parliament); while only
5% of one-shot advertisers are part of this category. Regarding
there exist 13 Medical Health
more sensitive categories,
persistent advertisers such as THINX (related to women’s
health), and Merck Group (a pharmaceutical company).
In the next section, we discuss how the text of the ads
changes across time when a user receives multiple ads from
the same advertiser.
3) Who targets what types?: In this section we investigate
which advertisers use opaque and more invasive targeting types
such as Data brokers, PII-based and Lookalike audiences more
frequently. Table XI shows for each targeting type the top two
advertiser categories with regards to the fraction of advertisers
from the category that have used the respective targeting type.
Overall, we see that the IAB categories of advertisers that
make use of such targeting types are consistent across datasets
and include a sensitive category, Business and Finance.
Advertisers in Automotive (8.7%; 5.7% in DATA-BRAZIL)
and Business and Finance (5.9%; 7.7% in DATA-BRAZIL),
use Data brokers more frequently in both datasets. In all cases
it is a signiﬁcant increase compared to 2% of all advertisers
which overall use Data brokers (Table VIII).
Automotive advertisers that use Data brokers include many
well known companies like Opel, Volkswagen, and Peugeot,
indicating a possible industry practice, since data brokers are
known to collect data about vehicle ownership [22]. Business
and Finance advertisers, which also use Lookalike audiences
very frequently in both datasets (31.2% in DATA-WORLDWIDE
and 27.7% in DATA-BRAZIL), include insurance companies
like AXA Deutschland, ﬁnancial services like germantaxes.de
and banks like Santander Brasil.
4) Takeaways: Thus far, we have observed a variety of
marketing practices by advertisers both big and small. The tar-
geting mechanisms sometimes invasive (e.g. PII-based, Data
brokers) and often opaque (e.g. Lookalike audiences). The
data used from targeting comes from a multitude of sources:
advertisers (e.g. PII-based), the ad platform (e.g. Interests),
