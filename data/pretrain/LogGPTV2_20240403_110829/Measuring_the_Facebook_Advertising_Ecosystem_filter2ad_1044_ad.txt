#### Key Observations
1. **Retargeting:**
   - A non-trivial fraction (12%) of ads are part of retargeting, meaning advertisers are trying to reach users who have previously interacted with them.

2. **PII-Based Targeting:**
   - A small share of ads (3%) use PII-based targeting, which is one of the lowest precedence methods.
   - However, a large number of users (79%) have been targeted with at least one PII-based ad, indicating that advertisers have access to identifiable information such as email or phone numbers.
   - There is no verification process for how advertisers gather this information, and lists of personal data can be easily bought online. This raises concerns about privacy and potential misuse, including discriminatory advertising and leaks of personal information.

3. **Social Neighborhood Targeting:**
   - Surprisingly, social neighborhood targeting only accounts for a very small fraction of ads (2%). This is unexpected given the competitive advantage of social media in this area compared to traditional advertising.

#### Regional Differences
- **Data Brokers and PII-Based Targeting:**
  - These methods are more frequent in North America (2% and 6% of ads, respectively) compared to Europe (1% and 2%).
  - More North American users (81%) have received PII-based ads compared to European users (73%), reflecting differences in privacy laws and data handling practices.

- **European Advertisers:**
  - Use retargeting and lookalike audiences less frequently but age/gender/location more frequently.
  - This suggests that current privacy discussions and laws may influence European advertisers' strategies.

### Persistent vs. One-Shot Targeting
- **Persistent Advertiser:**
  - An advertiser that has advertised to at least one user over more than two weeks with more than five ads.
- **One-Shot Advertiser:**
  - An advertiser that targeted all users no more than once.

- **Impact of Biases and Limitations:**
  - To avoid overestimating one-shot advertisers, results are reported for users with more than two weeks of data.
  - Results for users with more than four and six weeks of data show similar trends.

- **Key Findings:**
  - The majority of advertisers (65%) are one-shot, while only a small minority (3%) are persistent.
  - Most persistent advertisers (88%) target only one or two users, but some have targeted up to 17 users globally and 63 in Brazil.

### Characteristics of Advertisers

  - Persistent advertisers are generally more popular and likely to be verified, but niche advertisers also exist.

- **Targeting Types:**

    - Use lookalike audiences, PII-based, and retargeting less frequently.
