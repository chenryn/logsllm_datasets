##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Feature Idea
##### COMPONENT NAME
azure_rm_common.py
##### SUMMARY
The current definition of the azure_rm common module utils doesn't allow
overriding the various built-in endpoints (auth, table/blob storage, service
bus, etc). This will be necessary to allow connection to other Azure instances
(eg, AzureChinaCloud, private Azure Stack instances).
The new Python SDK seems to support overriding the endpoints via host_base, so
we should add the override capability to the env credential mapping and common
module utility code.
List of AzureChinaCloud endpoint URLs is at: Azure/azure-sdk-for-python#284
