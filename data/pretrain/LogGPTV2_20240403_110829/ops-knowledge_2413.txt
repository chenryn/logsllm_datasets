User: Please provide some common container security problems and propose corresponding solutions.
Assistant: Common container security issues include: 1. Injection attack: An attacker injects malicious code into a container to obtain permissions or information inside the container. Solution: - You should always use the latest container images and security updates to avoid hijacking or contamination of container images. - Avoid installing and executing unknown or untrusted applications inside containers, allowing only reliable and verified code to run. 2. Unauthorized access: Attackers can illegally access the internal content of the container by exploiting the vulnerabilities in the container image. Solution: - You should use trusted repositories to obtain container images and avoid downloading images from unknown sources. - Use a container firewall to limit the network traffic in and out of the container. - The container image should be updated in time to fix container vulnerabilities and deny attacks. 3. Privilege escalation: The attacker controls the entire container by obtaining the root privilege of a process in the container, causing major security incidents. Solution: - Avoid operating with root privileges in the container to reduce the risk of leakage. - Avoid mounting sensitive directories or files of the host inside the container, and use container storage volumes instead. - Automatically generate temporary and random user IDs or authorization codes to avoid conflicts with host or container master users. 4. Data leakage: Sensitive data or keys stored in the container are leaked by system or user misoperation. Solution: - Use encryption technology in the container to keep the data safe. - When the data is no longer used, information related to sensitive data should be cleared or deleted immediately. - Strengthen container monitoring and auditing functions to facilitate timely discovery and location of security issues. 5. Dependency attack: An attacker can exploit a vulnerability in the application or its components to attack the container. Solution: - Regularly update container images or application versions, including components or libraries. - Restrict container network access to only a limited scope of access. - Hierarchical management of container images to avoid duplication or redundant dependencies.
