### 4. Malicious IoT Implant

#### 4.1 Design Criteria

To achieve its objectives, the attacker must adhere to specific design criteria for the malicious IoT implant:

1. **Small Dimensions**: The implant must be small enough to be concealed within the enclosure of the target device. Smaller dimensions also make detection more difficult.
2. **Wireless Connectivity**: For remote control, the implant requires a radio transceiver that can communicate with a Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) infrastructure, such as LoRa, to avoid the need for the attacker's physical presence.
3. **Access to Serial Communication**: The implant should act as a legitimate participant on the serial bus, enabling it to eavesdrop on transactions and insert malicious ones.
4. **Invisibility**: The implant should not interfere with the normal operation of the target device except during an active attack.
5. **Low-Power Consumption**: The implant can be powered by an external source (e.g., battery or accumulator) or by the target device itself. To maximize the lifespan of both the implant and the target device, the implant should consume minimal energy.
6. **Low-Cost**: The implant should be designed using primarily off-the-shelf components to keep costs low.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scientific endeavor to design and implement an implant that meets all these criteria.

#### 4.2 Attack Procedures

To achieve the attacker's high-level objectives, we propose hardware-level attacks that interfere with the communication on the I2C bus. The implant must be connected to the SDA and SCL signal lines of the target device.

**Eavesdropping**: This passive attack involves the implant observing and storing data transmitted on the I2C bus. The data can then be relayed to the attacker via the wireless interface.

**Denial-of-Service (DoS)**: A DoS attack disables all communication on the I2C bus. The implant can perform this active attack by permanently pulling the SDA and SCL lines to a low voltage state, preventing further data transmission. Other bus participants will be unable to communicate until the implant releases the signal lines.

**Injection of Transactions**: In this active attack, the implant acts as an additional master on the bus. By exploiting time gaps between transactions, the implant can execute its own transactions, allowing for further implicit attacks:
   - **Memory and Configuration Readout**: The implant can read data from memory chips and slave configurations, which can then be exfiltrated to the attacker.
   - **Reconfiguration**: The implant can send commands to modify slave configurations, such as altering pre-configured thresholds or disabling slaves. This can lead to slave impersonation attacks, where the implant responds to messages intended for the legitimate master.

**On-The-Fly Bit Modification**: During the transmission of a logical 1 on the I2C bus, the transmitting IC releases the SDA signal, and a pull-up resistor pulls the voltage to a high level. The implant can use this idle state to pull the SDA signal to a low level, changing the transmitted bit to a logical 0. Due to the electronic characteristics of the I2C bus, modifying a logical 0 to a logical 1 is not possible.

#### 4.3 Implementation

**Wireless Connectivity**: We use LoRa technology for the wireless communication interface. While other LPWAN standards like SigFox, Weightless, and LTE Narrowband IoT exist, LoRa has a larger community of industrial and private partners. The Things Network (TTN) serves as the service provider, allowing application builders to register and connect to their deployed IoT nodes via LoRaWAN.

**Hardware Architecture**: The implant consists of a PCB equipped with various integrated circuits (ICs), as shown in Figure 2. It can be powered by an input voltage between 3.3 V and 16 V, supplied either by the target device or a battery. The front side of the implant includes a power converter, I/O interface, MCU, capacitors, and an optional indicator LED. The MCU, STM32F303CBT6, features an ARM Cortex-M4 core and 128 Kbytes of Flash memory. The RFM95W-868S2 radio transceiver supports LoRa and operates in the 868 MHz frequency band. A simple wired monopole antenna is soldered to the transceiver. A removable programming and debug interface (SWD) is provided for firmware development and debugging.

**Software Architecture**: The software architecture is based on the STM32CubeMX platform, which includes the hardware abstraction layer and link layer for the MCU. The FreeRTOS real-time operating system is used, along with libraries such as the board support package, LMiC for LoRaWAN, and Arduino JSON for message encoding and decoding. Tasks are defined for different functionalities, such as the "attack task" for implementing attack procedures and the "LED task" for managing the indicator LED.

### 5. Evaluation

**Dimensions**: The implant's size is 19.5 × 17.8 mm with a height of 4.5 mm and weighs 3 g. These dimensions are suitable for many threat scenarios, especially when the enclosure provides adequate space. Further miniaturization may be possible by using custom components instead of off-the-shelf ones.

**Power Consumption**: The implant consumes 110 µA in sleep mode and 42 mA in attack mode. A 3.7 V Lithium polymer battery with a capacity of 2000 mAh can power the implant for over two years in sleep mode or 176 hours in attack mode.

**Wireless Range**: Using LoRa, the implant can achieve a wireless range of 2–5 km in urban areas and up to 15 km in suburban areas. The actual range depends on factors such as the enclosure, building structures, and interference from other wireless networks.

**Cost**: The hardware cost for a batch of 10 implants is approximately 194 Euros, decreasing to about 11 Euros per unit for a batch of 100 units. These costs include the PCB and all electronic components but exclude laboratory equipment, labor, shipping, and consumables.

### 5.1 Effort of Insertion

The process of inserting the implant into the target device involves three steps:
1. **Identifying Access Points**: Open the case, identify the PCBs, and list the ICs. Use datasheets to confirm I2C support and find suitable solder points.
2. **Analyzing Communication**: Use a logic analyzer to inspect the I2C bus communication, identifying ICs, bus frequency, and transmitted data.
3. **Inserting the Implant**: Solder wires onto the identified solder points, attach them to the implant, and secure the implant within the device. Test the implant and ensure it can be remotely controlled before closing the casing.

**Feasibility of Attacks**: We demonstrated the feasibility of the attacks by inserting the implant into an evaluation board, a First Alert 3040DFE cash box, and a Syma X5C-1 drone. Each scenario showed that the implant could perform eavesdropping, DoS, and transaction injection without affecting the normal operation of the target device during sleep mode.

### 5.2 Feasibility of Attacks

**Evaluation Board**: The evaluation board mimics a temperature monitoring system. The implant successfully performed all described attacks, including eavesdropping, DoS, and on-the-fly bit modification, without interfering with normal operations during sleep mode.

**Cash Box**: The implant was inserted into a First Alert 3040DFE cash box, allowing the attacker to eavesdrop on and set the master pin, thus accessing the content of the box. The implant did not affect normal operations during sleep mode.

**Drone**: The implant was attached to a Syma X5C-1 drone, enabling eavesdropping and DoS attacks. The implant did not affect the drone's normal flight characteristics during sleep mode but could disable the I2C bus upon receiving a DoS command, causing the drone to lose stability.

These demonstrations confirm the practicality and effectiveness of the malicious IoT implant in various real-world applications.
