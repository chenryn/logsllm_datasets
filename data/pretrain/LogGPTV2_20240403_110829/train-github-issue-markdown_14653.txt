I know that the new IO is being worked on, but I could see this being a sneaky
thing that gets lost.
    #![feature(io)]
    use std::io::Write;
    fn main() {
        write!(&mut std::io::stdout(), "Hello world").unwrap();
    }
This code prints nothing. If we use `stderr` instead, there is output.
