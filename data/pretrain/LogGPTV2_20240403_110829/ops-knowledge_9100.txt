User: I'm using PyGTK for a small app I've developing. The usage of URLlib2 through a proxy will freeze my GUI. Is there anyway to prevent that?
My code that actually does the work is seperate from the GUI, so I was thinking may be using subprocess to call the python file. However, how would that work if I was to convert the app to an exe file?
Thanks
Assistant: Calling urllib2 from the main thread blocks the Gtk event loop and consequently freezes the user interface.  This is not specific to urllib2, but happens with any longer running function (e.g. subprocess.call).
Either use the asynchronous IO facilities from glib or call urllib2 in a separate thread to avoid this issue.
