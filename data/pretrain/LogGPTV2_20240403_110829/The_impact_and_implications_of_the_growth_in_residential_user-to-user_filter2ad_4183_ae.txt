Table 6 shows the ranking of protocols and ports. To
rank port numbers in TCP and UDP, we took the smaller
of the source and destination ports for a ﬂow. TCP ports are
further divided into well-known ports that are smaller than
1024, and dynamic ports that are equal to or larger than
Table 7 shows the traﬃc matrix among residential users
(RBB), domestic data-centers and leased-lines (DOM), and
international addresses (INTL). Note that the data covers
only the ISP’s residential customer traﬃc so that the results
depict only the behavior of residential users. Residential
user-to-user traﬃc accounts for 63% of the total residential
traﬃc. This is a conservative estimate since the interna-
tional group also includes residential users.

A surprisingly large portion, about 90%, is domestic com-
munication where both ends are either domestic residential
users or other domestic addresses. One possible explanation
is language and cultural barriers; the majority of content
is in the Japanese language and/or is popular only with
the Japanese. However, there are many Japanese worldwide
who may access content in Japan, and Japanese content such
as animation is popular with non-Japanese as well. Another
plausible explanation is that domestic ﬁber users are con-
nected so well in terms of bandwidth and latency that super-
nodes in peer-to-peer networks are interconnected mainly
among domestic heavy-hitters.
A small degree of mis-classiﬁcation is found in the ta-
ble; 1.5% among DOM and INTL. Since the data is taken
from residential traﬃc, and non-residential ﬂow entries, e.g.,
management ﬂows for routers, were ﬁltered by the ISP in
advance, the traﬃc not including RBB should be zero. The
disparity is caused by new residential address blocks not
listed in the geo-IP database. Although it was possible to
ﬁx the database using the information from the ISP, we did
not do so since errors of the same kind are expected in ad-
dress blocks of other ISPs at a similar error rate.
Table 7 is further divided into heavy-hitters and normal
users in Table 8 where ﬂows with a heavy-hitter’s address at
either end are classiﬁed to the heavy-hitter traﬃc and the
rest of the ﬂows are classiﬁed into the normal user traﬃc.
The ratio of user-to-user traﬃc is 69% (48.4/69.7) for heavy-
hitters and 49% (14.9/30.3) for normal users. The ratio of
download traﬃc from DOM or INTL to RBB is much larger
for the normal users.
To show the geographic distribution of domestic user-to-
user traﬃc, a prefectural traﬃc matrix is shown in Figure 18
in which the prefectures are ordered by geographic locations
for source (row) and destination (column). In order to ob-
serve diﬀerences among prefectures, the traﬃc volumes are
normalized to the source prefecture so that the sum of the
columns for each row becomes 100%.

1024. We do not distinguish registered ports from dynamic
ports since many implementations use the registered port
range from 1024 through 49151 for dynamic ports.
Port 80 (http) accounts only for 9% of the total traﬃc.
TCP dynamic ports account for 83% but the usage of each
port is small, probably because the most popular peer-to-
peer ﬁle-sharing software in Japan, WINNY [13], uses ar-
bitrary ports. The largest one, port 6699, is only 1.4%. It
is evident that it is no longer possible to make use of port
numbers for identifying applications.
4.5 Geographic Trafﬁc Matrices
To investigate geographic communication patterns among
residential users, we classify traﬃc using the geo-IP databases.

Figure 18: Traﬃc matrix of 47 prefectures normal-
ized to the source prefecture. The columns have
similar values indicating that the distributions of
destinations are similar among diﬀerent prefectures.
All the rows in the matrix have similar distributions, that
is, users access similar destinations regardless of the user
location. It is also conﬁrmed that traﬃc volume is roughly
proportional to prefectural population. The traﬃc local to
the prefecture is on the diagonal line from the upper left to
the bottom right, and is only 2-3% of the total volume for all
the prefectures. On the other hand, we cannot identify any
increase in traﬃc to neighbor prefectures. A similar result
was found when the distribution is normalized to the desti-
nation prefecture. The results suggest that Internet traﬃc
has very poor locality, in contrast to telephone communica-
tion where users tend to talk to nearby neighbors. However,
this phenomenon might just be the behavior of dominant
applications rather than the fundamental nature of Internet
communication.
In order to distinguish application types in user-to-user
traﬃc, we investigated the number of peers for each user.
Before the experiment, we expected to observe two applica-
tion types: a small number of peers for video-streaming and
downloading from servers, and a large number of peers for
peer-to-peer ﬁle-sharing.
To observe the number of peers by unique IP address, it is
necessary to exclude peers with small traﬃc volumes since
the tail of the distribution is long due to small transactions
such as DNS lookups and web browsing. Thus, each user’s
peers are sorted inversely by volume, and then, the number
of peers exceeding the 50th-percentile of the user’s traﬃc
volume is counted. We call this number, the dominant peer
count. Our data set consisted of traﬃc from one day taken
on July 5th, 2005. The inbound traﬃc for those users who
used more than 1GB were extracted for analysis. The desti-
nation peer types are classiﬁed by the geo-IP databases into
residential users, domestic and others. Then, each user is
classiﬁed by the largest destination type into the user-to-
user group, the user-to-domestic group and others.
Figure 19 shows the (complementary) cumulative distri-
bution of dominant peer counts for user-to-user and user-
to-domestic for comparison. For the majority of the users
in the upper left region in the graph, the user-to-user group
has a much larger number of peers than the user-to-domestic
group; 80% of the user-to-user group at the horizontal line
have less than 18 dominant peers while 80% of the user-to-
domestic group have only less than 4.7 dominant peers. For
those who have many peers, the diﬀerence becomes smaller
