User: How to merge multiple folders into one using command line?
Assistant: You can use the following steps to merge multiple folders into one folder: 1. Open a command prompt window and go to the directory where the folders you want to merge are located. 2. Use the following commands to merge all folders into one folder: ``` xcopy /s folder1\*.* merged_folder\ xcopy /s folder2\*.* merged_folder\ xcopy /s folder3\*.* merged_folder\ .. . ``` `xcopy` is a command-line tool for copying files and folders. In the above command, the `/s` parameter means to copy all subdirectories and files together. `*.*` means to copy all files and folders into the new destination folder. 3. Wait for the command-line tool to finish merging the folders. The merged folder will appear in the `merged_folder` directory. Note: If the `merged_folder` directory already exists, the command will overwrite the files in it. Therefore, be sure to backup and check the folders you are merging before using this command.
