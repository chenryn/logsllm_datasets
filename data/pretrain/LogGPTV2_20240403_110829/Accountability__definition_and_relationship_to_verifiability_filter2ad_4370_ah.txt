on the only remaining number x has been posted on the bulletin
board.
Otherwise, as the machine has to assign l − 1 commitments from
the bulletin board to that receipt and open them (after shufﬂing and
masking, what is done correctly due to F), a would state dis(M),
what conﬂicts with X. Further suppose that a commitment on
the only remaining number has been posted on the bulletin board.
Then, this commitment cannot be assigned to the considered re-
ceipt (as this would mean that the machine assigned l previously
published commitments to one receipts which would imply that a
states dis(M) what contradicts X). If it were assigned to some other
receipt, then, by F, x would be also printed on this receipt, which
would contradict αtwice (and X). Finally, if it were not assigned to
any receipt, then it would be opened (with overwhelming probabil-
ity) and a would state dis(M) (Step J4), which, again, contradicts
X.
CLAIM 2. Assume that F and X hold. Then the probability that
M posts commitments on (a,R) and (b,R) (that share the same
number R) for candidates a (cid:54)= b on the bulletin board in the ini-
tialization phase is negligible.
Otherwise, as the machine eventually opens correctly every com-
mitment (possibly after masking and shufﬂing, what is done cor-
rectly due to F), R would occur twice with overwhelming probabil-
ity, which conﬂicts with X (either we have αtwice or a states dis(M)
).
Now, Claim 1 implies the following.
If, for some voter who
choses candidate i, (i) the number xi printed next to the chosen can-
didate is the number provided by the RNG and (ii) no commitment
to this number was posted on the bulletin board in the initialization
phase, then the machine produces a receipt which corresponds to
a vote for candidate i (i.e. the machine assigns exactly one com-
mitment (that has not been assigned to a receipt so far) for each
candidate but i to this receipt).
Hence, if the machine changes a vote of an honest voter, then
one of the following cases must hold: (a) the receipt handed out to
the voter does not match the receipt that is published on the Bul-
letin Board, (b) this receipt matches but condition (i) is violated,
or (c) this receipt matches and condition (ii) is violated. Case (a)
can happen undetectedly, only if the voter does not check whether
her receipt appears on the bulletin board, which has probability
(1 − qrec). Case (b) can only happen undetectedly, if the voter
does not check her receipt in the voting booth, which has proba-
bility (1− qnum). Finally, case (c) holds, by the well-formedness
of ballots, when it happens that the candidate j in the commitment
comm( j,xi) on the number xi produced by the RNG coincides with
the candidate chosen by the voter, that is if j = i. As the machine
does not know in the initialization phase which candidate the voter
will choose, and the RNG cannot learn the voters choice (assump-
tion A1), this happens only with probability ≤ max j=1,...,l p j. Note
that, by Claim 2, the candidate j is uniquely determined by xi.
Summing up, the probability that the machine changes unde-
tectedly the vote of a (ﬁxed) honest voter, given F, is bounded
by max((1 − qnum), (1 − qrec), max j=1,...,l p j) and some negligi-
ble function. Hence, the probability that, given F, the machine
changes undetectedly the votes of k + 1 honest voters is smaller
than max((1− qnum), (1− qrec), max j=1,...,l p j)k+1 + f ((cid:96)). As by
our assumption A4, the machine cannot vote on behalf of abstain-
ing voters, the goal γk is not achieved only if there are k +1 changed
votes, we get (13), which completes the proof.
A.4 Variant II
In this section, we discuss Variant II mentioned in Section 5, i.e.
the variant where the judge ignores that a voter complained in the
voting booth and the voting process simply continues.
For this purpose we will consider in this section a version of the
system where the judge does not blame anybody if a voter com-
plains in the voting booth.
Clearly, in this case, the machine can change the votes of the
voters by just ignoring the number transmitted from the RNG: an
honest voter will complain in that case, but the election will not be
aborted. For this variant of the system, we will therefore further
weaken the goal γk obtaining a goal γ(cid:48)
k which is already achieved
in a run if the result produced by the machine is correct up to votes
of dishonest voters, up to votes of voters complaining in the voting
booth, and up to k votes of honest voters who do not complain in
the booth.
We denote by Pa
Bingo2 this variant of the protocol, deﬁned as
Pa
Bingo1 with the difference that J2 is omitted (for reasons already
discussed).
Accountability of Pa
Bingo2 As already stated in Section 5, a severe
problem with Theorem 1 is that in case a voter complains, it is not
clear who to blame speciﬁcally, the authority (which M and the
RNG are part of) or a voter.
With the new judging procedure, this problem disappears, but at
the price of a weaker goal. More speciﬁcally, we have the following
accountability property:
Φ2 = {αtwice ⇒ dis(M)∨ dis(RNG),
¬γ(cid:48)
k ∩¬αtwice ⇒ dis(M) | dis(RNG)}.
For this, we obtain the following theorem:

PROOF. The proof of Theorem 5 is very similar to that of

complaining voters have to be changed. This can be done in the
same ways as in Theorem 1. But now, if the machine does not use
the number transmitted from the RNG at the correct place on the
receipt, that does not change the vote of an honest non-complaining
voter if the voter complains. Hence, also in this case, in order to
change an honest, non-complaining voters vote (by wrongly using
the number transmitted from the RNG), the machine has to hope
that the voter does not check the number. Hence we are exactly in
the situation of Theorem 1.
This theorem says that, in Pa
Bingo2, the probability that the goal
γ(cid:48)
k is not achieved and still a does not blame anybody is at most

Bingo. Since now a always (rightly) accuses authorities, it is eas-
ier to hold them accountable, even though not always individually.
Moreover, unlike in Pa
Bingo1, no voter can spoil the voting process.
On the downside, the goal now is weaker, and hence, the published
result may deviate more from the actual votes than previously, with-
out a blaming anybody.
Veriﬁability of Pa
Bingo2 As already discussed in Section 5, the ver-
iﬁability property stated in Corollary 1 reﬂects the weakness of the
system Pa
Bingo1(n,qnum,qrec,s,(cid:126)p) already revealed by Theorem 1:
By wrongly complaining, every single dishonest voter can spoil
the election process. This weakness is not present in the system
Pa
Bingo2 as stated in the corollary below, which, however, comes at
a price of a weaker goal:

B. THE PRST PROTOCOL
B.1 Our Improved Version
In this section, we describe in details our version of the PRST
protocol.
For our protocol, we assume an independent and honest bulletin
board, replacing the bulletin board controlled by the auctioneer: the
auctioneer A and every bidder Bi can post messages on the bulletin
board. The messages posted on the bulletin board appear with a
time-stamp, provided by the bulletin board. We implicitly assume
that the messages posted by A are signed by him; messages posted
by bidders are not. For privacy of the bidders, one can assume
that bidders can post messages on the bulletin board anonymously.
Notaries are superﬂuous in our protocol.
Now, our version of the protocol consists of the following steps,
where Steps S1’ and S6’ are exactly like the corresponding steps in
the original version of the protocol:
S1’. A posts (on the bulletin board) basic information about the
auction: the terms of the auction, an identiﬁer Id, the dead-
lines T1,T2,T3 for different stages of the auction, and his pub-
lic encryption key.
S2’. Bidder Bi computes her encrypted bid Ci = EA(bi,ri), gen-
erates a nonce qi, and computes her commitment as Comi =
(cid:104)hash(Ci), hash(qi),Id(cid:105). The bidder is supposed to keep the
nonce qi secret, except for the situation described below. Bi
posts (on the bulletin board)
Id, EA(sigBi [Comi],r(cid:48)
i)
(14)
before time T1. The (hash of the) nonce qi will be used to pre-
vent Problem 4 (see Step S7’). Posting (14), instead of send-
ing the signed commitment directly to A will prevent Prob-
lem 1. The signature in (14) is encrypted to hide Bi’s identify
from other bidders and observers. Note that Bi does not use
notaries and does not send her signed commitment directly to
A. Also, A is not required to send receipts.
S3’. At time T1, the auctioneer decrypts and collects all the com-
mitments posted in the previous step and posts these commit-
ments in a random order:
Comπ(1), . . . ,Comπ(n)
(15)
where π is a randomly chosen permutation of the indices of
previously posted commitments.
17
If two or more commitments in this list have the same value,
then the auctioneer additionally posts the list of bidder’s sig-
natures on all these commitments. The bidder whose signa-
ture is at the ﬁrst position on this list is challenged: she is
supposed to open her commitment before time T2 (see the next
step). This procedure enables the judge to resolve the conﬂict
described in Problem 2.
S4’. Between time T1 and T2 any bidder Bi whose bid is not in-
cluded in the list of commitments posted by A in the previous
step, appeals by posting
Id, sigBi [Comi], r(cid:48)
i.
(16)
(If the identity of Bi is to be kept secret, this message may be
sent to the judge only).
Also, before time T2, a bidder Bi who has been challenged in
the previous step, opens her commitment (if she does not do
it, she will be blamed; otherwise all the other bidders whose
signatures are on this list will be blamed; see V2’).5
S5’. After time T2, every Bi opens her commitment by posting
(cid:104)Comi,Ci(cid:105) on the bulletin board (posting (cid:104)Comi,Ci(cid:105) instead
of sending Ci to A prevents Problem 2). After time T3, A posts
(17)
(while this step is redundant, we keep it for compliance with
the original version of the protocol) and posts bidder’s signa-
ture on every unopened commitment.
Cπ(1), . . . ,Cπ(n)
S6’. A recovers the bids b1, . . . ,bn, by decrypting the encrypted
bids with his private decryption key, and determines the win-
ner Bw of the auction and the price bu the winner has to pay,
which is supposed to be the second highest bid. He also con-
structs a (universally veriﬁable) zero-knowledge proof P that
the result is correct, i.e. Cw contains the biggest bid and Cu
contains the second biggest bid bu: This is done by proving
appropriate inequalities between the bids in the ciphertexts
C1, . . . ,Cn, without revealing these bids, and by revealing the
random coin used in Cu, which he can recover using his pri-
vate key. The auctioneer posts
Bw, bu, sigBw [Comw], P.
(18)
(If more than one committed bid contains the highest value,
then the winner/winners are determined according to some
pre-agreed policy; due to space limitation, we do not consider
this case further.)
S7’. A bidder B j (cid:54)= Bw checks whether the signed commitment
Comw posted by the auctioneer in (18) is her own commit-
ment. If it is the case, she claims the fact, by posting q j on
the bulletin board, before some determined time. Note that by
this B j does not reveal her identity.
The new judging procedure performed by V is as follows:
V1.’ If A does not publish the list of commitments when expected
in Step S3’, then V blames A (states dis(A)).
V2.’ If two or more commitments in (15) have the same value
c and A does not post signatures on these commitments as
required in S3’, then A is blamed.
If A posts such a list
(c) then the following verdicts are stated:
sigBi1
If the commitment c is opened before time T2 (supposedly
by the challenged bidder Bi1), then V states dis(Bi2 ) ∧ ··· ∧
dis(Bil ); otherwise, V states dis(Bi1 ).
(c), . . . , sigBil
5One could extend this procedure such that, if the challenged bid-
der does not open the commitment, then the next bidder is chal-
lenged, and so on. By this we could guarantee higher precision of
blaming.
V3.’ If in Step S4’, message (16) is posted such that there is a cor-
responding encryption in a message of the form (14) posted
before time T1 and Comi is not included in the list of commit-
ments posted by A in Step S3’, then V blames A.
V4.’ After Step S5’, if the bulletin board does not contain an entry
that opens some commitment Comi, then: If A has not pro-
vided the required signature in Step S5’, then V blames him.
Otherwise, the party identiﬁed by this signature is blamed.
Furthermore, if A does not post (17), then A is blamed.
V5.’ If, in Step S6’, A does not post a result with a valid zero-
knowledge proof and a valid signature sigw[Comw], then V
blames A.
V6.’ If, in Step S7’, a nonce qw is posted such that Comw contains
hash(qw), then V blames Bw.
We, again, consider a few variants of the protocol: By PJ
PRST (cid:48) we
denote our version of the protocol with an additional, honest party,
the judge, who runs the judging procedure described above. By
PRST (cid:48), for X ∈ {A,B1, . . . ,Bn}, we denote our version of the pro-
PX
tocol, where X is assumed to be honest and his/her honest program
is extended by the judging procedure.
B.2 Symbolic Model of Processes
In this section we instantiate the abstract notion of a protocol
by a symbolic model, where atomic processes, following [31], are
represented as functions that for a sequence of input messages (the
messages received so far) produce output messages.
This model, unlike many other symbolic models (like π-
calculus), by means of a so called master process (a scheduler),
enables us to precisely model phases of the protocol so that every
