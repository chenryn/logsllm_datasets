 4 20:10:41 INFO MemoryStore started with capacity 17.7 GB
The first three parts of the log are index, timestamp, and log level. Without considering these three parts, Here we assume that the variables in the logs are represented as '<*>', separated by spaces between tokens. What is the specific log template for the above logs?

A: Block <*> stored as bytes in memory (estimated size <*>, free <*>) 和 MemoryStore started with capacity <*> GB
B: Changing view acls to: <*> 和 Changing modify acls to: <*>
C: Registered signal handlers for [TERM, HUP, INT] 和 Slf4jLogger started
D: Registered signal handlers for [TERM, HUP, INT] 和 SecurityManager: authentication disabled; ui acls disabled; users with view permissions: Set(yarn, curi); users with modify permissions: Set(yarn, curi)
