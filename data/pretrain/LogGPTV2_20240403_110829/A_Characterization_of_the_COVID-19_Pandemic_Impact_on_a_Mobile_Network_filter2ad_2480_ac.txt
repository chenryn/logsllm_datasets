reference value for mobility entropy is higher (20% above
the average, see Figure 5b). This shows that within London,
in general, people move more randomly and with less pre-
dictable mobility pattern, but cover smaller areas than the
national average. This analysis also bring to our attention
the regional differences in how people relax the mobility re-
strictions, with an increase in mobility in London and West
Yorkshire in weeks 18-19. This is not the case for the regions
of Greater Manchester and West Midlands, where mobility is
consistently low after week 13. Finally, metrics distributions
have little variance in all regions, and all percentiles are close
to the median, following similar trends.
Takeaway: The impact of the lockdown is consistent over
different regions in the UK, showing that people respected
the lockdown, regardless where they live. We do, however,
find regional differences in how people relax the mobility
restrictions, with an increase in mobility in London and West
Yorkshire in weeks 18-19. This is not the case for the regions
of Greater Manchester and West Midlands, where mobility
is consistently low after week 13.

3.3 Geodemographic Mobility
To capture the changes in users’ mobility in correlation with
different social and demographic characteristics of their resi-
dence area, we study the variation of mobility metrics across
different geo-spacial clusters as defined by the UK Office for
National Statistics (ONS)[13]. This consists of eight groups
meant to be illustrative of the characteristics of areas in
terms of their demographic structure, household composi-
tion, housing, socio-economic characteristics and employ-
ment patterns. Each of the eight categories provides the most
generic descriptions of the corresponding population group
in the UK (Table 1).
We break down the mobility metrics variations per week
in each of the above-mentioned area groups (Figure 6). We
find that mobility in rural areas is normally higher than the
nation average and people usually cover wider areas in their
daily movement (weeks 9-11 in Figure 6a). Contrariwise, in
highly populated urban areas (such as Cosmopolitans or Eth-
nicity central), the population covers smaller areas (weeks
9-11 in Figure 6a), but the predictability of their mobility
patterns is lower (higher entropy in weeks 9-11 in Figure 6b).
All the different socio-economic groups present the same
significant drop in mobility, with a transition period in week
12 and a steep drop from week 13. Gyration decreases across
all groups by more than 50% of the national average in week
9. As it was observed in the previous section, the ethnicity

frame. To evaluate the temporary relocation of Inner London
residents to secondary locations, we generate its mobility
matrix at a county level (see Figure 7). For each Inner London
resident (obtained using the method described in 2.3), we
check the top 20 locations (at county level) that they visit
during each day (cf. Section 2.3). If none of the visited loca-
tions during a day matches their home county (Inner London
in this case) we are able to identify relocations, i.e. people
with residence in London that are elsewhere. Figure 7 shows
the variation in the number of Inner London residents who
are present in the different counties (we capture a different
county per row) per day, compared to the average number
we identified in week 9, before the lockdown.
By looking at the Inner London line we observe a perma-
nent 10% decrease in the number of Inner London residents
who actually are present in their area of residence from week
13 onward (after the lockdown is imposed). Contributions to
the decrease in the number of Inner London residents who
remain in their inferred homes during the lockdown period
may include, for example, students who left campuses in
London after schools closing on the 19th of March, or long-
term tourist leaving Inner London center areas, or London
residents who decided to spend the lockdown in their second
residences. In particular, we observe an increase in the num-
ber of people from London who relocated to the Hampshire
area during most of the duration of the lockdown.
Further, we note that mobility patterns of Inner London
residents changed significantly after the stay-at-home order
was imposed. Specifically, before the stay-at-home recom-
mendations, we observe an increase of Londoners spending
the weekend in other counties in the UK. This pattern dis-
appears starting from weeks 11 and 12, concurrent with the
recommendation of social distancing. We capture a large
variation in the number of people travelling from Inner Lon-
don to outside areas such as East Sussex on the 21st-22nd of
March, just prior to the stay-at-home order. We also observe
an additional increase of Londoners going to Hampshire for
the weekend by the end of April (also in Kent but less so),
consistent with the overall (slight) increase observed at the
end of the period in the overall mobility metrics.

central group (which would basically correspond to Inner
London), the reduction of gyration is the highest of all the
groups but their reduction in entropy is the smallest, imply-
ing that they have reduced they area of mobility the most,
but within that area their movement is more random. This is
probably related to the high density of commercial services
in central London. Finally, we observe that metrics’ distribu-
tion has little variance in all geodemographic clusters.
Takeaway: All users in different geodemographic clus-
ters present the same significant drop in mobility, with a
transition period in week 12 and a steep drop from week 13.
3.4 Temporary Relocation from London
In this section, we measure how many people from London
decided to move elsewhere during (part of) the analyzed time

variation per day (on the x axis) in the number of resident from Inner London active in the county marked in the y axis
compared to the median value over week 9. We include in our mobility matrix the top 10 counties in terms of receiving
inbound residents from Inner London according to the average in week 9.
Takeaway: We find a sustained 10% decrease in the num-
ber of Inner London residents who actually are present in
their area of residence from week 13 onward (after the lock-
down is imposed). We capture a large variation in the number
of people travelling from Inner London to outside areas such
as East Sussex on the 21st-22nd of March, just prior to the
stay-at-home order being enforced.
4 MOBILE NETWORK PERFORMANCE
In this section, we analyze mobile network performance indi-
cators to investigate how changes in people’s mobility induce
shifts in the usual traffic patterns we observe in the radio
network, and further impact the mobile network operations.
4.1 Data Traffic Evolution
We investigate the dynamics of the network performance
metrics we defined in Section 2.4 across the UK, aggregating
all bearers per cell, including voice and data traffic (i.e., we
aggregate all bearers for QCI 1 to 8). Our analysis spans a
period of 10 weeks, from 23rd of February until the 10th of
May. Unless otherwise stated, for all metrics we present the
delta variation percentage of each metric from its median
value over week 9.
Figure 8: Downlink Data Volume captures the variation of
the downlink data volume during the weeks we mark on the
x-axis. Throughout the UK, we note an increase of 8% in the
average data volume per cell in week 10. This is followed by
a steady decrease, with the lowest registered volume in week
17 (-24% compared to week 9). Our observation is consistent
with people’s mobility decrease after the stay-at-home order
(Section 3). We conjecture that after lockdown people relied
less on the cellular network for data connectivity (e.g., using
home WiFi connectivity instead), thus contributing to the
surge of traffic reported by residential ISPs.3
Indeed, we observe in Figure 8: Uplink Data Volume a sig-
nificant reduction of active downlink users per hour per cell
compared to week 9 throughout the entire UK (all regions),
with a minimum number of active users in week 19 (-28.6%

Figure 8: MNO performance characterization, using met-
rics for all data traffic. Each plot corresponds to a metric, as
we indicate in the title of the plot. We show the median val-
ues for the delta variation percentage for each metric over
one week week (each point on the x-axis corresponds to a
week #), using as a baseline for comparison the median value
in week 9. Each line corresponds to different geo-regions
within the UK, including "UK - all regions", which accounts
for the entire country.
users compared to week 9). Note that, despite we observe a
slight recovery of mobility in week 14 (cf. Section 3), this is
not sufficient to have an impact on the downlink data vol-
ume, the number of active users, or the radio load per cell,
which do not increase.
We find a small reduction in the downlink user through-
put in the 10 weeks we analyze (Figure 8: User Downlink
Throughput)), with the lowest value being a 10% drop com-
pared to week 9. This follows the same trend as the decrease
in downlink traffic volume. This is unexpected, as in pres-
ence of less traffic (cf. Figure 8: Downlink Data Volume) and
8
overall lower active downlink users per cell (cf. Figure 8:
Downlink Active Users), the per user throughput should in-
crease. We also observe that congestion in the radio network
is not the cause of this decrease because the radio load also
decreases ( Figure 8: Cell Resource Utilization shows a 15.1%
radio load decrease in week 16 compared to week 9). We
conjecture the per-user throughput is application limited
and not network limited during the weeks of the analysis.
This is in line with the choice of many content providers to
reduce content quality during the pandemic and by the shift
of more data-intensive applications to wifi access. 4
We also investigate the variation of the total uplink data
volume per cell in the UK (Figure 8: Uplink Data Volume). We
find overall modest changes for this metric, with, less than 5%
decrease in the median daily volumes in week 18. This sug-
gests that applications making intensive use of the downlink
(e.g., video streaming) suffered a significantly higher traffic
reduction than applications with symmetric uplink/downlink
usage (e.g., audio/video conferences, or voice traffic). In par-
ticular, as we present in the next section, we observe that
voice traffic (corresponding to QCI=1) has significantly in-
creased during the lockdown period.
Altogether, because the downlink data volume is one order
of magnitude larger than the uplink data volume, the volume
of data traffic carried by the network experienced an overall
reduction of roughly 20%, reverting to 2019 traffic volume
(when the MNO had less customers and applications were
less bandwidth hungry).
Finally, we note that metrics’ distribution across cells does
not significantly change across weeks with respect to the
reference week 9. A wide distribution is common in large op-
erational environments, where cells support different RATs
types across the country (e.g, LTE, LTE-A), different number
of customers each cell serves, different radio coverage, etc.
The only exception we note is in the 90th percentile in the
downlink active user per hour per cell (not picture for read-
ability reasons), which slightly reduces during the lockdown
phase, thus showing the nation-wide impact on the users
connectivity habits.
Takeaway: We find an overall reduction (-24% in week
17 compared to week 9) in downlink data traffic volume
throughput the UK during lockdown. Unintuitively, we also
note a decrease in the average user throughput. Though a
decrease in radio cell resource utilization and in overall traffic
may have hinted to the opposite, we find the throughput to
drop by at most 10%, likely due to application throttling. We
also observe uplink traffic volume has little variation.

Figure 9: Analysis of 4G voice traffic (corresponding to
QCI=1) patterns in the UK. We show the median values for
the delta variation percentage, which we generate compared
to the national average during week 9 for all the UK, over
a period of 10 weeks (each point corresponds to a week #
we mark on the x-axis), from the end of February until mid-
May. Each line corresponds to different metric.
4.2 Voice Traffic
We now analyze the changes in voice traffic patterns, to
further drill down on the potential dynamics that impact the
total volumes of data traffic we observe. We filter 4G traffic
marked with QCI equal to 1 (conversational traffic), and
analyze the performance metrics we previously explained
in Section 2.4. Figure 9 shows the evolution of these metric
