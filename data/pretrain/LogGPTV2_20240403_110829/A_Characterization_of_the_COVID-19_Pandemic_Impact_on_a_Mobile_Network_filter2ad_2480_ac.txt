### Reference Value for Mobility Entropy

The reference value for mobility entropy is 20% above the national average (see Figure 5b). This indicates that, within London, people generally move more randomly and with less predictable mobility patterns, but they cover smaller areas compared to the national average. The analysis also highlights regional differences in how people relax mobility restrictions. For example, there is an increase in mobility in London and West Yorkshire during weeks 18-19, which is not observed in Greater Manchester and the West Midlands, where mobility remains consistently low after week 13. Additionally, the distributions of metrics across all regions show little variance, with all percentiles close to the median, following similar trends.

**Takeaway:** The impact of the lockdown is consistent across different regions in the UK, indicating that people generally respected the lockdown regardless of where they lived. However, regional differences in how people relaxed mobility restrictions are evident, with increased mobility in London and West Yorkshire during weeks 18-19, while mobility in Greater Manchester and the West Midlands remained consistently low after week 13.

### Geodemographic Mobility

To understand the changes in users' mobility in relation to the social and demographic characteristics of their residence areas, we analyzed the variation of mobility metrics across different geospatial clusters as defined by the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) [13]. These clusters consist of eight groups that illustrate the characteristics of areas in terms of demographic structure, household composition, housing, socio-economic characteristics, and employment patterns. Each category provides a general description of the corresponding population group in the UK (Table 1).

We examined the weekly variations in mobility metrics for each of these area groups (Figure 6). Our findings indicate that mobility in rural areas is typically higher than the national average, with people covering wider areas in their daily movements (weeks 9-11 in Figure 6a). Conversely, in densely populated urban areas (such as Cosmopolitans or Ethnicity Central), the population covers smaller areas (weeks 9-11 in Figure 6a), but their mobility patterns are less predictable (higher entropy in weeks 9-11 in Figure 6b). All socio-economic groups experienced a significant drop in mobility, with a transition period in week 12 and a steep decline from week 13. Gyration decreased across all groups by more than 50% of the national average in week 9. As observed in the previous section, the ethnicity central group (corresponding to Inner London) had the highest reduction in gyration but the smallest reduction in entropy, suggesting that they reduced their area of mobility the most, but within that area, their movement became more random. This is likely related to the high density of commercial services in central London. Finally, the distribution of metrics showed little variance across all geodemographic clusters.

**Takeaway:** Users in different geodemographic clusters experienced a significant drop in mobility, with a transition period in week 12 and a steep decline from week 13.

### Temporary Relocation from London

In this section, we measured the number of people from London who decided to move elsewhere during the analyzed period. We generated a mobility matrix at the county level to evaluate the temporary relocation of Inner London residents (see Figure 7). For each Inner London resident, we checked the top 20 locations (at the county level) they visited each day. If none of the visited locations matched their home county (Inner London), we identified relocations. Figure 7 shows the variation in the number of Inner London residents present in different counties per day, compared to the average number in week 9, before the lockdown.

We observed a permanent 10% decrease in the number of Inner London residents present in their area of residence from week 13 onward (after the lockdown was imposed). This decrease can be attributed to factors such as students leaving campuses after schools closed on March 19th, long-term tourists departing, or London residents choosing to spend the lockdown in their second residences. Specifically, we noted an increase in the number of people from London relocating to the Hampshire area during most of the lockdown period.

Additionally, we observed a significant change in the mobility patterns of Inner London residents after the stay-at-home order. Before the recommendations, there was an increase in Londoners spending weekends in other counties. This pattern disappeared starting from weeks 11 and 12, coinciding with the recommendation for social distancing. We recorded a large variation in the number of people traveling from Inner London to outside areas such as East Sussex on March 21st-22nd, just before the stay-at-home order. We also observed an additional increase in Londoners going to Hampshire for the weekend by the end of April, consistent with the overall slight increase in mobility metrics at the end of the period.

**Takeaway:** We found a sustained 10% decrease in the number of Inner London residents present in their area of residence from week 13 onward. There was a large variation in the number of people traveling from Inner London to outside areas such as East Sussex on March 21st-22nd, just before the stay-at-home order.

### Mobile Network Performance

#### Data Traffic Evolution

We analyzed mobile network performance indicators to investigate how changes in people's mobility affected traffic patterns in the radio network and impacted mobile network operations. We examined the dynamics of network performance metrics across the UK, aggregating all bearers per cell, including voice and data traffic (i.e., aggregating all bearers for QCI 1 to 8). Our analysis spanned 10 weeks, from February 23rd to May 10th. Unless otherwise stated, we presented the delta variation percentage of each metric from its median value in week 9.

**Downlink Data Volume:** Throughout the UK, we noted an 8% increase in the average data volume per cell in week 10, followed by a steady decrease, with the lowest volume in week 17 (-24% compared to week 9). This trend is consistent with the decrease in people's mobility after the stay-at-home order (Section 3). We conjecture that after the lockdown, people relied less on the cellular network for data connectivity, instead using home WiFi, contributing to the surge in traffic reported by residential ISPs [3].

**Uplink Data Volume:** We observed a significant reduction in the number of active downlink users per hour per cell compared to week 9, with the minimum number of active users in week 19 (-28.6% compared to week 9). Despite a slight recovery in mobility in week 14, this did not significantly impact the downlink data volume, the number of active users, or the radio load per cell.

**User Downlink Throughput:** We found a small reduction in downlink user throughput over the 10 weeks, with the lowest value being a 10% drop compared to week 9. This trend was unexpected, given the decrease in downlink traffic volume and the lower number of active downlink users per cell. The radio load also decreased (15.1% in week 16 compared to week 9), suggesting that the per-user throughput was application-limited rather than network-limited. This aligns with the decision of many content providers to reduce content quality and the shift of data-intensive applications to WiFi access [4].

**Total Uplink Data Volume:** We found modest changes in the total uplink data volume per cell, with less than a 5% decrease in the median daily volumes in week 18. This suggests that applications with symmetric uplink/downlink usage (e.g., audio/video conferences, voice traffic) suffered less than those with intensive downlink usage (e.g., video streaming). In particular, we observed a significant increase in voice traffic (QCI=1) during the lockdown period.

**Overall Data Traffic Volume:** The downlink data volume is one order of magnitude larger than the uplink data volume. Therefore, the overall volume of data traffic carried by the network experienced a reduction of roughly 20%, reverting to 2019 levels (when the MNO had fewer customers and applications were less bandwidth-hungry).

**Metrics Distribution Across Cells:** The distribution of metrics across cells did not significantly change across weeks compared to the reference week 9. A wide distribution is common in large operational environments, where cells support different RAT types (e.g., LTE, LTE-A), serve different numbers of customers, and have varying radio coverage. The only exception was a slight reduction in the 90th percentile of downlink active users per hour per cell during the lockdown phase, indicating a nationwide impact on users' connectivity habits.

**Takeaway:** We found an overall reduction (-24% in week 17 compared to week 9) in downlink data traffic volume throughout the UK during the lockdown. Unintuitively, we also noted a decrease in the average user throughput, likely due to application throttling. Uplink traffic volume showed little variation.

### Voice Traffic

We analyzed changes in voice traffic patterns to further understand the dynamics impacting the total volumes of data traffic. We filtered 4G traffic marked with QCI equal to 1 (conversational traffic) and analyzed the performance metrics previously explained in Section 2.4. Figure 9 shows the evolution of these metrics.
