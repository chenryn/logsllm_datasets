### Ode to the DEFCON 15 Badge

**By Joe Grand (Kingpin)**

- **Total Time Spent:** 170 hours
- **Honeymoon Sacrifice:** 2 nights (a regrettable but necessary trade-off)
- **Circuit Board Revisions:** 3
- **Total Components:** 863,600
- **Hackers Wearing the Badge:** 6,800

For a more detailed account, please read on.

#### Badge Features

- **LED Matrix:** 95 LEDs (5 columns by 19 rows)
- **Power Source:** Two CR2032 3V Lithium coin-cell batteries
- **Text Cutouts and Soldermask Colors:** Six, indicating different roles (human, speaker, goon, vendor, press, or uber)

#### Initial Setup

Upon powering up, the badge remains silent, designed to be in a sleep state. To activate it, follow these steps:

1. **Activate the Badge:**
   - Press the top icon (which is actually a button).
   - A scrolling text message will appear.

2. **Custom Text Entry:**
   - Press the top icon again to enter custom text mode.
   - Use the bottom icon to cycle through characters.
   - Tap both icons to save a character to your queue (maximum 16 characters).

3. **Finalize Your Message:**
   - When finished, find the solid block.
   - Tap both icons to display your message on the screen.

4. **Adjust Scroll Speed:**
   - Select the scroll speed between 1 and 5, where 1 is slow and 5 is fast.
   - Tap both icons to apply the changes.

5. **Persistence-of-Vision (POV) Mode:**
   - Wave the badge in one direction to reveal a secret message.
   - If the message appears jumbled, try adjusting the light conditions or modifying the hard-coded bytes.

#### Additional Information

- **Open Source and Free Schematics:**
  - The source code and schematics are freely available.
  - Unpopulated footprints for a wireless transceiver and accelerometer are included.
  - Modify the badge to suit your needs and potentially win development tools, T-shirts, or other prizes.

- **Talk and Resources:**
  - Join my talk on Friday morning for an in-depth look at the badge's creation.
  - Complete source code and schematics can be found on the DEFCON CD and at [Grand Idea Studio](http://www.grandideastudio.com).
  - Development environment: Codewarrior Development Studio for HC(S)08 Microcontrollers, available for free (up to 16KB) from [Freescale](http://www.freescale.com/codewarrior).
  - Hardware debugging tools: SPYDER08 module and P&E Micro HCS08 MultiLink USB-ML-12.

- **Badge Hacking Contest:**
  - The top three most innovative, obscure, or mischievous badge hacks will be recognized and awarded at the DEFCON Award Ceremonies on Sunday.
  - A table in the vendor area will provide a soldering iron, tools, extra components, and engineering support for your hacking pleasure.

See you there!

This year’s badge is centered around a Freescale MC9S08QG8 microcontroller, featuring a 95 surface-mount LED matrix (5 columns by 19 rows) for user-customizable scrolling text messages. It requires two CR2032 3V Lithium coin-cell batteries. Optional circuitry, fully designed but unpopulated, supports a Freescale MMA7260QT Triple-Axis Accelerometer for motion-control applications and an MC13191FC 2.4GHz RF Transceiver for 802.15.4 or ZigBee applications. The badge is entirely hackable—wear it, use it, modify it, break it, and learn from it.
