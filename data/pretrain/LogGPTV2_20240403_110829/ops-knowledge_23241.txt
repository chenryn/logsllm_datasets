User: I use ubuntu 10.10, and I have both Python 2.x and Python 3.x. I have a program that needs to run with python 3.x (blender 2.5x).
How do I run a program with python 3.x?
Assistant: Do you have a separate python executable for python 2.x and for python 3.x?  On my system I have /usr/bin/python2.5 and /usr/bin/python2.6.  I also have a /usr/bin/python2, which is a symbolic link to /usr/bin/python2.6.  I presume that you have a /usr/bin/python3 too.  In which case, you simply run the program using /usr/bin/python3 instead of the more generic /usr/bin/python.
I hope this helps.
