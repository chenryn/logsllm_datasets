## Abstract
This paper presents a detailed comparison of the performance characteristics of a 3G network operated by a nationwide provider and a metro-scale WiFi network operated by a commercial ISP, specifically in the context of vehicular network access. Our findings indicate that, over a wide geographic region and under vehicular mobility, these networks exhibit distinct throughput and coverage characteristics. While WiFi experiences frequent disconnections even in a commercially operated, metro-scale deployment, it delivers high throughput when connected. In contrast, the 3G network offers consistent but generally lower throughput, with excellent coverage and less variability. The complementary nature of these network characteristics suggests the potential for a hybrid network design, where 3G data can be offloaded to WiFi to improve performance, reduce congestion, and lower costs.

## 1. Introduction
3G cellular data and WiFi are the two primary wireless broadband access technologies available today. These networks have significant differences. 3G operates on licensed bands with macrocells covering large areas, requiring substantial capital and operational costs. WiFi, on the other hand, uses unlicensed spectrum, with smaller coverage areas and typically lower costs. Users often expect WiFi to be free or inexpensive and provide higher bit rates (in the order of tens of Mbps), but with limited local coverage, whereas 3G is more ubiquitous.

Recent advancements in outdoor and vehicular WiFi access have started to blur the lines between 3G and WiFi. Metro-scale WiFi deployments have made it possible to achieve good coverage in urban areas, making it feasible to use WiFi in mobile scenarios at vehicular speeds. This raises the question: Can WiFi be effectively used in outdoor and mobile scenarios to reduce the load on expensive 3G networks? Demonstrating the technical viability of this approach could lead to the development of more efficient and cost-effective wireless broadband access solutions.

Our paper makes the following contributions:
1. An in-depth evaluation of WiFi access with vehicular mobility using a commercially operated metro-scale WiFi network, contrasting with prior studies that focused on open APs or limited deployments.
2. A head-to-head comparison of WiFi and 3G access under vehicular mobility, highlighting the key features of each network and providing insights for future hybrid network designs.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses related work, Section 3 describes the measurement setup, Section 4 presents the analysis of the results, and Section 5 concludes the paper.

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Vehicular WiFi Access
Several experimental studies have explored the potential of using intermittently available WiFi connectivity from moving vehicles for data transfers. For example, the Drive-thru Internet project [23, 24] conducted controlled experiments with a single car driving past a single access point to measure range and connectivity. The CarTel project [7] focused on upload performance using open APs, while the ViFi project [5] improved link layer performance by exploiting macrodiversity and opportunistic receptions.

Download performance and intermittent connectivity have been studied in the Cabernet project [11], which used an improved handoff scheme and a new transport protocol. Our previous work [9] also focused on downloads, emphasizing predictive methods for improving handoffs and prefetching in APs for better download performance. Other research has addressed issues such as maintaining sessions in the presence of intermittent connectivity [11, 24].

### 2.2 Characterizing 3G Access
Characterizing 3G access in mobile or stationary environments has received less attention, likely due to the closed nature and tight operator control of 3G networks. Key works in this area include cross-layer measurement studies to evaluate TCP performance over 1xRTT [19] and EVDO networks [15], capacity evaluation of UMTS networks [26], and bandwidth predictability in HSDPA networks [28]. A city-wide measurement system for WiFi and EVDO networks was developed in [22].

### 2.3 Augmenting Mobile 3G Using WiFi
A recent study [4] explored augmenting mobile 3G by offloading data to WiFi whenever possible. However, they primarily used open APs, resulting in lower median WiFi throughput. Our work focuses on the performance of a single commercially operated WiFi network.

## 3. Measurement Setup

### 3.1 Network
For our study, we used a metro-scale WiFi deployment in the Long Island area of New York, provided by Cablevision's 'Optimum WiFi' service. This network extends to most populous areas of Long Island and parts of New York City, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and New Jersey, with approximately 18,000 APs. WiFi access is free for Cablevision subscribers.

For 3G access, we used Verizon’s EVDO Rev. A service with the USB760 USB-based air interface. EVDO Rev. A supports a maximum bit rate of 3 Mbps, with a claimed maximum TCP throughput of 1.5 Mbps. In our tests, we occasionally achieved higher throughputs of around 2 Mbps.

### 3.2 Testbed
We used a Dell Latitude laptop running Linux as the client machine. The original miniPCI WiFi interface was replaced with a carrier-grade interface (Ubiquity XR2) with a transmit power of 25 dBm and a high-gain (12 dBi) omni-directional antenna. We experimented with various antennas and transmit powers, finding the 12 dBi antenna to provide the best connectivity. The antenna was carried inside the car, with its top part protruding from the sunroof.

The laptop also included Verizon’s USB760 EVDO Rev. A modem and a USB-based Garmin GPS receiver, logging the GPS location every second. A server program on a lab machine with a public IP address continuously transmitted 1500-byte packets over TCP to the client, enabling download throughput tests.

### 3.3 Driving Scenarios
Two driving scenarios were used for our evaluations:

- **Long Drive:** A 500-mile drive (Figure 1) conducted in a continuous fashion, taking about 5 hours. The vehicle speed varied depending on road traffic. Each road was driven in both directions to account for differences in AP visibility and signal strength. This drive was performed once, providing a sample of WiFi access quality in a metro-scale deployment. The association records showed over 900 unique APs.

- **Short Repeated Drives:** A 9-mile stretch of Route 25 (Figure 2) was driven multiple times to gather more detailed and repeatable data.
