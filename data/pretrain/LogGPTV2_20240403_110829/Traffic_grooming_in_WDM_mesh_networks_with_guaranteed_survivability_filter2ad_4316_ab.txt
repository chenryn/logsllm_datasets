not an issue in the above papers. Our approach is signiﬁcantly
different in that we simply exclude disrupted lightpaths, rather
than rerouting them.
III. ILP FORMULATIONS FOR SURVIVABLE TRAFFIC
GROOMING
Existing approaches for survivable routing presented in the
literature assume that a logical topology has already been
determined, and is given as an input. So, it is quite possible
that a feasible survivable routing does not exist for the given
topology. Our approach differs from the existing schemes in
that
i) we ensure a survivable routing exists, as part of the
logical topology design process, and
ii) we guarantee that the surviving lightpaths (after any
single link failure) can handle, using trafﬁc re-routings
alone, all the trafﬁc that was ﬂowing on the network
before the fault occurred.
In this section, we will formulate the combined logical
topology design and survivable routing problem as two ILP
formulations. The objective of the ﬁrst ILP formulation, ILP1,
is to maximize the throughput by utilizing the given resources.
The objective of the second formulation, ILP2, is to minimize
the number of lightpaths while accommodating all requests.

Constraints (6) – (12) are used to perform RWA for each
selected lightpath. Constraint (6) ensures that,

exactly one route over the physical topology. Constraint (7)
enforces the wavelength continuity constraint and ensures that
exactly one wavelength is assigned to each selected lightpath.

maximizes the weighted sum of trafﬁc requests, (cid:88)
The above formulation uses an integer variables yq, which
speciﬁes whether trafﬁc request q can be accommodated in
the network. If request q is handled by the above formulation,
yq = 1. Thus tq · yq gives the contribution of request q to the
network throughput. Equation (1) is the objective function that
yq · tq,
which can be handled by the network. This value depends
on available resources such as the number of transceivers per
node, the capacity of a lightpath and the number of available
channels per ﬁber.
q∈Q
Constraint (2) gives the standard ﬂow conservation con-
straint for each possible failure scenario. This enforces the
ﬂow constraints only for commodities that are accommodated
in the network (i.e., yq = 1).
Constraint (3) is used to enforce the capacity constraint on
each lightpath, by ensuring that the maximum trafﬁc is less
than the lightpath capacity g, if the lightpath is selected. It also
ensures that if edge e fails, no data is routed over a logical
edge p that includes edge e. Constraint (4) ((5)) ensures that
p,r = 1 and wk,p = 1,
k,p ≥ 1, 1 ≥ βe
k,p and
constraints (9), (10) and (11) become βe
1 ≥ βe
k,p, forcing βe
k,p to be 1.
We note that βe
k,p is deﬁned as a continuous variable, even
though it is constrained to take on integer values of 0 or 1 only.
The use of this technique signiﬁcantly reduces the number of
integer variables in this formulation and hence the time needed
to solve it [19]. Finally, constraint (12) ensures that a particular
channel k on a physical edge e cannot be assigned to more
than one lightpath.
C. Formulation for Survivable Trafﬁc Grooming for minimiz-
ing the number of lightpaths (ILP2)
Formulation ILP2 is a modiﬁcation of ILP1 to handle the
problem of minimizing the total number of lightpaths while
accommodating the entire set of trafﬁc requests. Unlike ILP1,
which always succeeds, ILP2 fails if the resources available
in the network is not sufﬁcient to accommodate all the trafﬁc
requests. The formulation is given below.
