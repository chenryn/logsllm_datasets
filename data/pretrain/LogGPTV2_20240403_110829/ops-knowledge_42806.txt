User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Exim listed in htop, but not installed - server sending spam So, I have a Ubuntu 12.04 server on Amazon. It recently started sending spam emails. When I do htop to see the proceess list, I can see the exim process there, but it's NOT installed! We're using postfix.

What I tried so far:


kill the process (reappears immediately)
upgrade everything (apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get upgrade)
Enable X-PHP-Originating-Script in my logs (But it doesn't show in the logs)
ps aux: www-data 22612  0.4  0.1  35660  7152 ?        Ss   09:24   0:01 exim

netstat -lp

Any help appreciated...I tried searching but found nothing.

Assistant: exim is running as www-data which should not normally be the case. Your server has probably been compromised by some malware.

You can have some more info on the exim process by looking at /proc//exe which is a symlink to the actual binary. You may also use ps axjf to get its parent process.

I would suggest you to restore your server from the last safe backup.
