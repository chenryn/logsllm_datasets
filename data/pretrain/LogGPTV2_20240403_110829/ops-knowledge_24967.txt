User: Please provide a high availability database schema design.
Assistant: 1. Active-active architecture design scheme: The active-active architecture refers to deploying databases in two different data centers, and ensuring data consistency through a two-way synchronization mechanism. One of the data centers is the main node, which provides services for all updates; the other data center is a backup node, which can take over the service if the main node fails. In the active-active architecture, multiple nodes with read-write separation can be used to improve performance and availability. 2. Master-slave replication structure design scheme: The master-slave replication structure refers to read and write operations in the master database, and the slave database periodically synchronizes data from the master database to ensure the consistency of the slave database and the master database. When there is a problem with the master database, the service can be quickly suspended and the slave database can be switched to the master database. At the same time, read-only nodes can be set in the slave database to increase performance and reliability. 3. Distributed database architecture design scheme: The distributed database architecture disperses and stores data in different nodes according to different strategies. Improve availability through methods such as load balancing, data slicing, and replication. Distributed databases can be freely expanded according to application requirements, reducing the risk of single point of failure, while providing high availability, high performance and high scalability. 4. Containerized database architecture design scheme: The containerized database runs the database as a service in a container, and multiple container instances can be created to improve availability and reduce the risk of single point of failure. At the same time, containerized databases can flexibly adjust resource allocation to improve system elasticity and flexibility. Containerized databases can be managed and deployed through container orchestration tools such as Kubernetes, Docker swarm, etc., providing high availability and high flexibility services.
