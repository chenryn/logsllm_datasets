**Current behavior**
Here is my code: the template is:  
` 时间: {{DataContext.时间}} `
Here '时间' is Chinese char which means time, and in the typescript file. I
define a DataContext property.
    export class TestClass{
     @Input()
     DataContext:any;  }
But it not work, I got a error. Here is the error message, "Template parse
errors: Parser Error: Unexpected token Lexer Error: Unexpected character
{{时间}}......"
**Expected behavior**
I hope the data binding can work with Chinese property name.  
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
I really need it support Chinese char, because the json data from a old
system, and all the data's properties use Chinese char. Without this, I will
have to convert all the json files.
