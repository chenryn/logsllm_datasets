### Bug report
**Bug summary**
When saving the figure as a PDF, the items are grouped unusually, which leads
to unexpected results when shown in a viewer that supports knockout effects.  
While this is not problematic most of the time, the issue causes troubles if
the PDF created by matplotlib is edited within Illustrator (possibly other PDF
editors as well).
**Code for reproduction**
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    x = [42,43,44]
    y=[42,43,44]
    plt.scatter(x,y,alpha=0.7,sizes=[500], linewidths=[5])
    plt.savefig('sample.pdf')
**Actual outcome**  
Because I initially thought this is an Illustrator related problem, I posted a
(very detailed) description in one of the Adobe Forums.
In (MacOS) Preview.app

In Adobe Illustrator:

In the Adobe Illustrator forum I got the feedback that the grouping of the
items is unusual and causes the confusion. Indeed, ungrouping the elements
resolved all of my problems.
**Expected outcome**  
Same as in default preview app.
**Matplotlib version**
  * MacOS 10.14.5
  * Matplotlib v3.1.1
  * Matplotlib backend: MacOSX
  * Python 3.6.7
