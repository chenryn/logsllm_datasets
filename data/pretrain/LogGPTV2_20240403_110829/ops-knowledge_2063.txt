User: My question is how can I open a given path in a window and continue the script? I'd also like to select where to put that window.
This is aimed to Ubuntu, where I can set a window in any corner by pressing cntrl + alt + 1/7/9/3.
I've tried this so far, but appart from not being able to continue the script, I can't select where to position the window:
import subprocess
subprocess.Popen(["xdg-open", "/home/user/Desktop"])
Thanks
Assistant: The window placement is performed according to the placement policy of ones user interface. This can be influenced by add-ons, but depends on the user interface you use.
As to the continuation of the script, you could call the subprocess.Popen(...) in a thread you create for that purpose.
