User: How to configure network load balancing?
Assistant: The network load balancing configuration process is as follows: 1. Build a network load balancer to distribute network traffic to multiple servers by installing load balancing software or professional load balancer hardware. 2. Configure the health check to determine whether the server is working normally by checking the status of the server, such as CPU load, disk space, network delay and other indicators. If a server fails, the load balancer stops forwarding traffic to it. 3. Configure the load balancing algorithm. You can select different load balancing algorithms as required. For example, round robin, weighted round robin, least connections, IP hashing, etc. These algorithms will determine how to distribute traffic evenly among the servers. 4. Configure the cluster servers Add the cluster servers to the load balancer, making sure they are connected to the correct network ports. Make sure the server's network configuration is correct, and add servers if needed. 5. Test and monitor After you have configured, test and monitor to make sure the load balancer is working properly. Monitor the performance of your servers, and check your load balancer's logs and reports to determine if changes or tuning are required.
