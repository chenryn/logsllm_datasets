If you use setSource on a SearchRequestBuilder and then call to string the
SearchRequest will appear to be cleared.
    SearchRequestBuilder srb = client().prepareSearch().setSource("{\"query\":\"match\":{\"foo\":\"bar\"}}");
    srb.execute().get();
Will execute the correct search, however
    SearchRequestBuilder srb = client().prepareSearch().setSource("{\"query\":\"match\":{\"foo\":\"bar\"}}");
    logger.debug("About to execute [{}]",srb.toString());
    srb.execute().get();
Will execute an empty search.
The problem is that `toString()` calls `internalBuilder()` which calls
`sourceBuilder()`
        private SearchSourceBuilder sourceBuilder() {
            if (sourceBuilder == null) {
                sourceBuilder = new SearchSourceBuilder();
            }
            return sourceBuilder;
        }
Then when the `SearchRequestBuilder.execute` is called the request that was
constructed via `setSource` is replaced by an empty sourceBuilder.
        @Override
        protected void doExecute(ActionListener listener) {
            if (sourceBuilder != null) {
                request.source(sourceBuilder());
            }
            client.search(request, listener);
        }
