### Abstract
Mouse dynamics, the process of identifying individual users based on their mouse operating characteristics, has shown promising results but remains an emerging technique with performance that is not yet fully acceptable. This study introduces a novel approach using a pattern-growth-based mining method to extract frequent behavior segments, leading to more stable mouse characteristics. One-class classification algorithms are then employed to perform continuous user authentication. Experimental results demonstrate that mouse characteristics extracted from frequent behavior segments are much more stable than those from holistic behavior, achieving a practically useful level of performance with a False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 0.37% and a False Rejection Rate (FRR) of 1.12%. These findings suggest that mouse dynamics can significantly enhance traditional authentication systems. Our dataset is publicly available to facilitate future research.

## 1. Introduction
Cybersecurity threats, including attacks by external and internal impostors, have been a significant problem. Common approaches, such as passwords and malware, often fail to provide adequate protection. User authentication mechanisms, particularly continuous authentication, offer a solution by monitoring user behavior throughout a session without active user involvement. Among the various techniques, mouse dynamics is a promising direction. It utilizes features in mouse operations to detect masqueraders, offering a non-intrusive and seamless integration into normal computer use.

Previous work on mouse dynamics has shown some promising results, but the technique has not yet reached an acceptable level of performance. The main challenge is the intrinsic variability in mouse behavior, which can be influenced by human factors, software environments, and emotional states. This study addresses these issues by proposing a new approach that uses a pattern-growth-based mining method to extract frequent behavior segments, leading to more stable and accurate characterization of mouse behavior.

### 1.1 Contributions
1. **Addressing Behavioral Variability:** We propose a novel approach using a pattern-growth-based mining method to extract frequent behavior segments, leading to a more accurate and fine-grained characterization of mouse behavior.
2. **One-Class Classification:** We employ one-class learning and anomaly detection methods to perform the task of continuous user authentication, eliminating the need for samples from impostors.
3. **Practical Application:** Using a newly established mouse behavioral data set, we demonstrate the practicality of our approach in real-world applications.
4. **Public Dataset:** We make our mouse behavioral data set publicly available to facilitate repeatable and objective evaluations and comparisons.

## 2. Background and Related Work
### 2.1 Review of Mouse Dynamics
Mouse dynamics involves using human interface devices (HIDs) like the keyboard and mouse to record user behavior. Everitt and McOwan [21] first investigated whether users could be distinguished by their mouse operating styles in 2003. Since then, several studies have explored the use of mouse dynamics for user verification. For example, Pusara and Brodley [1] proposed a re-authentication scheme using raw mouse data, achieving a false-acceptance rate (FAR) of 1.75% and a false-rejection rate (FRR) of 0.43%.

### 2.2 Continuous Authentication Based on Mouse Dynamics
Continuous authentication monitors user behavior throughout a session to ensure security. Pusara and Brodley [1] proposed a re-authentication procedure, while Ahmed and Traore [6, 12] analyzed the feasibility of mouse dynamics combined with keystroke biometrics. Nan et al. [25] presented a user verification system using newly-defined angle-based metrics, achieving high accuracy. However, most previous studies required both legitimate and imposter samples for training, which is not realistic in practice.

## 3. Methodology
### 3.1 Data Collection
We collected mouse behavior data from several HP workstations equipped with identical hardware and software. Each desktop was connected to a central server via the Internet. The server, running Windows Server 2003, stored the collected data along with subject IDs. The data collection process involved recording about thirty minutes of a user's mouse activity in each session.

### 3.2 Pattern-Growth-Based Mining
Our approach uses a pattern-growth-based mining method to extract frequent behavior segments from the collected data. This leads to a more stable and accurate characterization of mouse behavior. We then employ one-class classification algorithms to perform the task of continuous user authentication, eliminating the need for imposter samples.

## 4. Experimental Results
Experimental results show that mouse characteristics extracted from frequent behavior segments are much more stable than those from holistic behavior. The proposed approach achieves a FAR of 0.37% and an FRR of 1.12%, indicating a practically useful level of performance. These findings suggest that mouse dynamics can significantly enhance traditional authentication systems.

## 5. Discussion
The intrinsic variability in mouse behavior is a major challenge in mouse dynamics research. Our approach addresses this issue by extracting frequent behavior segments, leading to more stable and accurate characterization. The use of one-class classification algorithms further enhances the practicality of the approach by eliminating the need for imposter samples.

## 6. Conclusion
This study presents a novel approach to continuous authentication using mouse dynamics. By employing a pattern-growth-based mining method and one-class classification algorithms, we achieve a practically useful level of performance. Our dataset is publicly available to facilitate future research and objective evaluations.
