Certainly! Here's a more polished and professional version of your text:

The list in the provided CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/vqk87kvj1y) contains 10,000 items. When I move an item from the bottom to the top, React performs 9,999 `insertBefore` operations, which is highly inefficient.

In contrast, take a look at the InfernoJS example (https://jsbin.com/qeqatiruko/1/edit?html,js,output). It only performs a single `insertBefore` operation for the same action, regardless of the list size. This results in significantly better performance.

This version is more structured and clearly conveys the issue and the comparison between React and InfernoJS.
