User: I written a simple shell in python and compiled it with nuitka.
My shell as some simple commands, such as "say string", "braille string", "stop" etc.
This program uses python accessible_output package to communicate with screen reader in windows.
Ok, this works well froma a normal shell, or executing it from windows.
Now, I would like run this program from within emacs, such as normal shell in emacs.
I tried some functions, "start-process", "shell-command", but I can't write commands.
My program displays a prompt, like python interpreter, where I can put my commands.
Elisp is able to run python shells, mysql shells, but I'm unable to run my own shell.
Help!
Assistant: What about just launching your script from inside an emacs shell buffer?
M-x shell RET /path/to/my/script RET
