**ATT&CK ID:** S0363  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Empire

Empire can enumerate Security Support Providers (SSPs) and leverage PowerSploit's `Install-SSP` and `Invoke-Mimikatz` modules to install malicious SSPs and log authentication events. [2]

### Detailed Explanation:
- **Enumeration of SSPs:** Empire can list the available Security Support Providers, which are components responsible for handling security-related operations such as authentication.
- **Malicious SSP Installation:** By using PowerSploit's `Install-SSP` module, Empire can install a custom, malicious SSP on the target system.
- **Logging Authentication Events:** The `Invoke-Mimikatz` module can be used to log authentication events, allowing an attacker to capture sensitive information such as credentials.

This technique enables attackers to intercept and manipulate authentication processes, potentially leading to unauthorized access and credential theft.
