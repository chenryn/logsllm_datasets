from #5895:
"  
After discussion with @Crell, we agreed that the RequestContext is a burden in
reusing the routing component. That's because it only duplicates information
of the Request and is not really useful without it anyway. Since we probably
cannot remove it fully as it would be a big BC break, my idea is to make it
optional. So the symfony generator and matcher both work with a RequestContext
and a Request. I removed the RequestContextAwareInterface from the interfaces
so a custom router does not need a RequestContext anymore. The default symfony
generator/matcher still implements RequestContextAwareInterface but can also
work with a Request. So UrlMatcher::match(Request) is now also possible. And
the generator can use UrlGenerator::setRequest() instead of setContext().
I think it makes the routing more useable in symfony and more reusable for
other libraries.  
And it will probably make it easier to integrate content negotiation as
matching a request directly with all it's metadata (like Accept header) is now
possible.
One more point: symfony allowed to use matching a Request with #4363. But it's
not integrated in symfony as symfonys router does not use it at all. And the
important interfaces like the RouterInterface required the RequestContext
anyway. So there was no way to use Request matching without RequestContext.
This PR replaces the other extension point.
The only bc break is in terms of interfaces. People should be aware that
RequestContextAwareInterface is not part of
UrlGeneratorInterface/UrlMatcherInterface/RouterInterface anymore. And the
RequestMatcherInterface was changed.
