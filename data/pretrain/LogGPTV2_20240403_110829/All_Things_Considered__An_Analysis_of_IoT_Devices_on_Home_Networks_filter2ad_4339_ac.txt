primarily due to the three regions sharing a similar fraction of
storage devices (Table 4). Still, the regions vary in terms of
their IoT usage: 57.2% of Western European homes have at
least one IoT device, compared to 25.7% in Eastern European
homes.
Manufacturers in Western Europe are similar to the global
distribution with a handful of exceptions. Sagemcom and
Free, two French companies that sell media boxes and IP
cameras, are the ﬁrst and third largest media vendors in West-
ern Europe, accounting for 15.7% and 9.3% of all devices
compared to 5.7% and 3.2% globally. The markets of both
companies are highly localized, as 99% of their devices in
our dataset are located in Western and Northern Europe. In
other device categories, such as work appliances, game con-
soles, and home automation, there is limited variance from
the global distribution. Outside of North America and Ocea-
nia, Western Europe is the only other region where more than
1% of homes have a home automation device.
There are signiﬁcantly more surveillance devices in Eastern
Europe than Western Europe (14% versus 5.6% of devices).
Eastern Europe is also unlike most other regions in that its
rank ordered device type distribution changes as more IoT
devices are added over time. For homes with one IoT device,
surveillance devices only make up 5.3% of all IoT devices,
but this changes drastically for homes with 3 IoT devices,
where the number of surveillance devices shoots up to 13.8%.
The fraction of surveillance devices continually increases as
more IoT devices are added to Eastern European homes. In
homes with 10 IoT devices, surveillance devices are the most
popular device, accounting for 42.7% of all devices.
3.4 Asia
We analyze the four regions (East, Central, South, and South-
east) of Asia separately as they have different IoT proﬁles.
For example, surveillance devices make up 54.5%, 37%, and

(a) Vendors per Region
(b) Vendors per Device Type
Figure 4: IoT Vendors per Region and Device Type—There is a long tail of IoT manufacturers worldwide. However, in all
regions, 100 vendors account for more than 90% of devices and 400 vendors account for 99%. In contrast, some device types are
almost entirely dominated by one or two vendors. For example, Amazon and Google produce 91.9% of voice assistants and
Hikvision produces 18.6% of surveillance devices.
30.3% of devices in South, Southeast, and Central Asia (Fig-
ure 3), whereas only 9.1% of devices are surveillance related
in East Asia. This is not due to a large number of homes
with cameras, but rather that other types of IoT devices are
sparse. For example, only 9% of S.E. Asian Homes and
2.5% of South Asian homes contain a media device whereas
more than 40% homes in North America and Western Europe
do. Similar to other regions, Hikvision is the most prevalent
vendor of surveillance devices in S.E. Asia and South Asia,
making up 25.8% and 34.7% of surveillance devices in each
region respectively. Unlike other regions, a private5 vendor
accounts for 15.5% of all surveillance devices in Southern
Asia.
East and Central Asia are more similar to Eastern Europe
and Africa than they are to South and Southeast Asia. East
Asia, for example, is most similar to Sub-Saharan Africa
because its largest device type is work appliances, which
make up 44.5% of the devices in the region. Central Asia
more closely follows Eastern Europe with media devices
accounting for 54.2% of devices. All Asian regions do have
one thing in common: they are all the least similar to North
American homes, indicating fundamental differences in IoT
device usage between the Asian countries and North America.
3.5 Africa and Middle East
The North Africa, Middle East (combined) region is most
similar to Eastern Europe. Media devices are the most preva-
lent, appearing in 9.4% of homes and accounting for 35.7%
of devices. Again, we observe a local media vendor with
a large presence: Vestel, a Turkish TV manufacturer, is the
third largest media vendor after Samsung and LG. Surveil-
lance devices make up 28.5% of their overall devices, and
appear in 5.2% of homes. Sub-Saharan Africa is distinct in

that work appliances are most popular (50% of devices). 11%
homes in the region have at least one work appliance. The
most popular vendor is HP (33.6%), followed by a long tail
of other manufacturers.
3.6 Oceania
Oceania ranks third to North America and Western Europe in
terms of fraction of homes that contain an IoT device (49.2%
of homes). Similar to other regions, the most popular device
type in the region are media devices, which are found in
30.7% of homes. This is followed by work appliances (19.8%
of homes) and gaming consoles (10.1% of homes). Oceania
is one of the only regions that contains home automation
devices, appearing in 0.7% of homes in our dataset. Similar to
North America and Western Europe, Oceania has a moderate
number of voice assistant devices, which appear in 3.2% of
homes and account for 4.2% of all devices. Unlike North
America and Western Europe, homes in Oceania contain
many networked storage devices. They account for 4.3% of
all devices, which is most similar to homes in Eastern Europe
and East Asia.
IoT Device Vendors
3.7
While we ﬁnd devices from 14.3K unique vendors, 90% of
all devices globally are manufactured by 100 vendors (Fig-
ure 4a). Globally, there are 4,157 vendors (29%) that only
appear in one home. Unlike device type distributions, which
are consistent across region, vendor distributions vary heavily
across device type (Figure 4b). Some device types are domi-
nated by a small handful of vendors. For example, Amazon
and Google account for over 90% of voice assistant devices
globally. Other device types like media devices and surveil-
lance devices are split across many vendors. Media devices
are the most heterogeneous by vendor: the top 10 vendors
only account for 60% of devices.

Table 6: Vendor Correlation by Device Type—We show
the mean correlation in rank ordered vendor distributions per
device type across every pair of regions across all vendors as
well as the top 10 vendors in each category. The correlations
in bold are statistically signiﬁcant, and indicate consistency
in vendors for these device types across all regions in our
dataset.
Regional differences in vendor preferences may cause the
observed variance in vendor distributions across device types.
To measure this, we compute the pairwise Spearman’s corre-
lation for each vendor distribution across every pair of regions
(e.g. vendor distribution for voice assistants in North America
vs. East Asia). We then aggregate6over device type by taking
the average correlation across each pair of regions (Table 6).
We observe that device types dominated by a handful of
vendors globally (Figure 4b) show moderate to strong cor-
relations across all regions, indicating stability in popular
vendors across geographic areas. For example, game con-
soles are dominated by three major players (Microsoft, Sony,
Nintendo) in almost every region across the world. In con-
trast, there are a number of device types, such as media and
storage devices, for which there are no correlations across
region, even when looking only at the top 10 vendors. This
indicates that for these device types, regions have differing
vendor preferences. This result aligns with our investigation
of individual regions, where we observed many regions pre-
fer local media vendors that are less prevalent in the global
distribution.
4 Home Security
Beyond understanding the landscape of IoT devices, we in-
vestigate the security proﬁle of devices in homes, including
devices that allow weak authentication, the security proﬁle of
6We note that correlation coefﬁcients are not additive, so to aggregate
we convert the respective correlation r-values to z-values using a Fisher’s
Z transform [13], take the average of the Z values, and convert back to an
r-value. In addition, we could only compare rank order for vendors who
appeared in all 11 regions in the dataset. There were three device categories
(wearables, home appliances, generic IoT) for which no vendors appeared in
all regions; we could not compute correlations in these cases.

home routers, and the presence of homes that exhibit scanning
behavior on a large darknet.
Many IoT devices act as embedded servers: 67.5% of de-
vices provide at least one TCP- or UDP-based service. Many
of these services are not surprising—network printers nec-
essarily run services like IPP. However, we also note that
devices commonly support older protocols like Telnet (7.1%
of IoT devices) and FTP (7.8%). The most common proto-
col is Universal Plug and Play (UPnP), which is prevalent
on 46.2% of devices. We also observe HTTP and mDNS on
nearly half of devices. We show the top protocols in Table 7.
4.1 Weak Device Credentials
WiFi Inspector identiﬁes devices that allow authentication
with weak default credentials by attempting to log in to FTP
and Telnet services with a small dictionary of common default
credentials (Section 2). We ﬁnd that 7.1% of IoT devices and
14.6% of home routers support one of these two protocols.
