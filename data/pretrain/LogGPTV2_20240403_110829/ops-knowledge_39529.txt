In our company, we are planning to develop an application on Google App Engine that will handle user provisioning for Google Workspace. However, we are uncertain about which data source to use. We have considered two options:

1. A spreadsheet containing user data, which we would access using the Google Sheets API.
2. The Datastore, which would also store user data and be accessed via the Datastore API.

Our company currently has 3,493 users, and we are not fully aware of the pros and cons of each solution. We would appreciate any suggestions.

**Analysis:**

- **Using the Datastore:**
  - **Advantages:**
    - **Scalability:** Datastore is designed to scale automatically, making it suitable for a growing number of users.
    - **Integration:** It can be seamlessly integrated into your application, providing a more cohesive and efficient solution.
    - **Reliability:** Datastore offers high availability and durability, ensuring that user data is consistently accessible and secure.
  - **Disadvantages:**
    - **Complexity:** You will need to build out a way to manage and update user data within the Datastore, which may require additional development effort.
    - **Cost:** While Datastore is cost-effective, it may incur higher costs compared to using a free or low-cost spreadsheet solution, especially as the amount of data and queries increase.

- **Using Spreadsheets:**
  - **Advantages:**
    - **Simplicity:** Spreadsheets are easy to set up and manage, and they provide a familiar interface for administrators to update user data.
    - **Flexibility:** You can easily export, import, and manipulate data in spreadsheets, making it a versatile option.
    - **Collaboration:** Multiple team members can access and edit the spreadsheet simultaneously, facilitating collaboration.
  - **Disadvantages:**
    - **Scalability:** Spreadsheets may not scale as well as Datastore, especially with a large number of users and frequent updates.
    - **Performance:** Accessing and updating data via the Sheets API may introduce latency and performance issues, particularly if the application needs to handle a high volume of requests.
    - **Security:** While Google Sheets offers robust security features, managing sensitive user data in a spreadsheet may pose additional risks compared to a dedicated database like Datastore.

**Recommendation:**

Given the size of your user base (3,493 users), I recommend using the **Datastore** for the following reasons:
- **Scalability and Performance:** Datastore is better suited to handle a large and growing number of users, ensuring that your application remains performant and responsive.
- **Integration and Reliability:** Integrating Datastore with your application will provide a more seamless and reliable solution, reducing the risk of data inconsistencies and improving overall user experience.
- **Long-term Maintenance:** While there may be an initial development effort, using Datastore will likely result in a more maintainable and scalable solution in the long run.

If you choose to use Datastore, consider building a simple admin interface or dashboard within your application to manage and update user data, making it easier for administrators to interact with the system.
