### Improved Text

#### Introduction
A specific type of attack sends a small amount of traffic, which can cause conflicts in the kernel of vulnerable targets running earlier versions of Windows, leading to system crashes. In Figure 6, we present a 2-dimensional view of network activity over a ten-minute period, where two attacks were launched at 300 and 360 seconds. Figure 4 shows the number of packets on the network every five seconds during a UDP flood. By applying the signature axis, we can distinguish between normal and abnormal traffic.

#### Legitimate High Traffic Situations
One challenge is distinguishing high data transfer rates in legitimate circumstances from malicious activities. For example, "flash crowds" (as described in [23]) occur when a large number of users attempt to connect to a popular web server. This sudden surge in TCP traffic and the large number of connecting source IP addresses are similar to characteristics of a TCP SYN flood. However, there is a key difference: in a TCP SYN flood, spoofed IP addresses are used to tie up resources by holding half-open connections awaiting a non-existent reply. In a "flash crowd," the demand is so great that not all users can establish a connection, but some connections are still established.

#### TCP SYN Flood Attack
Figure 5 illustrates a TCP SYN flood attack, with two 20-second attacks launched at 300 and 360 seconds. Each attack involves approximately 1,000 individual IP addresses attempting to connect with the victim. The rise in network packets is due to SYN packets that initiate the first part of the TCP 3-way handshake without completing the connection. These spikes are caused by SYN packets sent to the victim.

#### 2-Dimensional vs. 3-Dimensional Detection
The 2-dimensional view in Figure 6 does not allow us to distinguish attack traffic from other network traffic. Even when viewed by protocol, it is challenging to differentiate between normal and abnormal traffic. When our early detection approach is applied to the same data, we can distinguish attack traffic from normal traffic. In Figure 7, despite only 9 packets being sent in the attack, the addition of the s-axis allows us to detect the attack. The main signature of this attack is that traffic is targeted at port 139, which is used for internal networking within Microsoft networks. External traffic connecting to this port is highly unlikely unless for malicious intent, making it an indicator of an attack.

#### Future Work
The perimeter model provides effective defenses against several security problems but is inadequate against DoS attacks when security devices are located on the victim system. An alternative approach is to detect and respond to DoS attacks in the communication medium before they reach their intended target. The controlled and finite architecture of the perimeter model allows for clear signature definitions, but by the time an attack is detected, it may have already achieved its goal. Our research has identified generic patterns or signatures of DoS attacks in the communication medium. These patterns are a combination of multiple factors rather than a single definitive signature, providing a distinction between normal and abnormal traffic.

We are currently working on implementing our approach, which complements the perimeter model to provide effective defense against DoS attacks. Key issues include balancing positive and false-positive reports, providing a response mechanism that does not adversely affect legitimate users, ensuring scalability, and addressing administration and control of the defense mechanisms. These issues form the basis of our future research.

#### Conclusions
The threat of network attacks, particularly DoS attacks, is very real. Current defenses rely on the perimeter security model, which is inadequate for DoS attacks. We propose a new approach that focuses on detecting DoS attacks beyond the perimeter, in the communication medium. This approach uses early detection signatures that are different from those used in the perimeter model. We have demonstrated the applicability of our approach through examples and a case study. Our future work will focus on developing a cost-effective defense against DoS attacks.
