that only sends a small amount of traffic. This traffic
causes conflicts in a vulnerable target's kernel running
earlier versions of Windows, resulting in the machine
crashing. In figure 6 below, we see a 2-dimensional view
of network activity over a ten-minute period. Two
attacks were launched at 300 seconds and 360 seconds.

in legitimate circumstances. For example,
One problem faced is that a high rate of data transfer
in a short period of time, targeted at a particular host, can
occur
in
occurrences of “flash crowds” such as [23], a large
amount of users attempt to connect to a popular Web
server. This large amount of connection attempts is
difficult to distinguish from a TCP SYN flood as both
phenonema have characteristics in common; sudden
volume increase of TCP traffic,
large amount of
connecting source IP addresses, and sustained time
period. However, there is a difference between the two.
As discussed earlier, a TCP SYN flood requires that
spoofed IP addresses are used to tie up resources on the
vicitim by holding half-open connections awaiting a non-
existent reply. In a “flash crowd” the demand is so great
that not all users wishing to establish a connection can do
so. However,

In figure 5, we see an example of a TCP SYN flood
attack. The graph shows two attacks, both lasting 20
seconds each, the first launched at 300 seconds and the
second at 360 seconds. In both attacks, we see unusual
sudden spikes caused by TCP traffic directed at a
particular host on the network. In both attacks, there are
approximately 1000 individual IP addresses attempting to
connect with the victim within each 20 second attack
period. The rise in the packets on the network is caused
by traffic that matches our signature: SYN packets that
belong to the first part of the TCP 3-way handshake with
no resulting connections being established. In this case,
we observe that the spikes are caused by SYN packets
being sent to the victim, represented by the number of

As we can see, the 2-dimensional view does not allow us
to distinguish the attack traffic from other traffic on the
network. Even when viewed by protocol, we can still not
clearly differentiate normal from abnormal traffic.

attack. Attacks are indistinguishable and were
launched at 300 and 360 seconds.
When we apply our early detection approach to the
same data as used in the 2-dimensional view of figure 6,
we are able to distinguish attack traffic from normal
traffic. In figure 7 below, despite only 9 packets being
sent in the attack, we can see that the attack is detected
by adding the s axis. Due to the small number of TCP
packets sent, we are not afforded the number of factors
observed in the UDP attack in figure 4 above. However,
the main signature of this attack is that traffic is targeted
at port 139. As this port is used for internal networking
within Microsoft networks it
is highly unlikely that
external traffic would connect to this port unless for
malicious intent. Therefore, we use this port use as an
indication of an attack.
Figure 7. View of network activity during anuke
attack. The 3-dimensional spikes allow us to
determine attack traffic.
The above examples have demonstrated that using
our 3-dimensional approach allows us to detect an attack
that cannot be seen in a 2-dimensional approach. 
6. Future work
The perimeter model provides effective defences
against a number of security problems. However, whilst
the security devices are located on the victim system,
they do not provide an adequate solution against DoS
attacks. An alternative approach is to detect and respond
to DoS attacks in the communications medium before
they are able to reach their intended target. In this way,
we are able to provide an effective defence against DoS
attacks. 
The controlled and finite architecture of the perimeter
model allow signatures to be clearly defined. However,
with perimeter model detection of DoS attacks, we face
a dichotomy. On the one hand, we have definite control
over the signatures that we detect, and on the other, by
the the time we have detected the attack, it has already
achieved its goal. The clear distinction afforded by
security policies is not available beyond the perimeter.
Therefore, signatures that are applicable to this external
environment are required. Our research has already
identified a number of generic patterns, or signatures, of
DoS attacks that are observed in the communications
medium. These patterns are a blending of a number of
factors, rather than one definitive signature. Combined,
they provide the distinction between normal and
abnormal
traffic. The more quantitative relationships
further
between pattern constituents will
require

We are currently working on an implementation of our
approach. The architecture required for our approach
does not attempt to replace the perimeter model, but
provides the effective defence against DoS attacks that is
required. Our approach must address a number of issues
to provide the protection needed. First, as the case study
presented in this paper demonstrates, attack detection
must balance reports of positives and false positives to be
effective. Second, related to the first issue, the approach
must provide a response mechanism that does not

scaleable. Fourth, we must consider the administration of
our early detection approach. Whilst detection beyond
the perimeter has distinct advantages in the face of DoS
attacks, it lacks one advantage of the perimeter model: a
central control authority. Therefore,
issues such as
control and administration of the defence mechanisms,
responsibility for signature updates when required, and
responsibility for policy management
require further
work. These issues form the basis of our future research
work.

Therefore, there is a need for a new approach to
provide an effective defence against DoS. Within this
paper, we have presented a new approach which focuses
on detecting DoS beyond the perimeter. This approach
detects attacks on the communication medium that all
traffic, whether valid or invalid, must traverse to reach
the intended destination. Current approaches to DoS
provide neither the power nor flexibility required for
early detection. We have presented a means by which
this early detection of attacks can be achieved. Attack
signatures used by the perimeter model cannot be applied
to an approach that does not
rely on this model.
Therefore, we have presented signatures required for
early detection. To demonstrate the applicability of our
approach, we have used examples of DoS attacks and a
case study. Our future work will concentrate on the
issues raised in section 6 to develop a cost-effective
defence against DoS attacks.
