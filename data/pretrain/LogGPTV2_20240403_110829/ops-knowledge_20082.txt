User: I went thought and installed pip and then added a bunch of libraries that I like to use and then, only after installing everything, did I realize that everything went into the 2.7.2 sit-packages directory, so the Python2.7.5 version doesn't see anything. 
Now, If I type python --version in the terminal, the correct version is started. However, pip is still "tied" to the default version of Python. 
How do I go about telling OSX to look at the new version of Python for everything?
Assistant: Honestly, one way around this is to make sure that virtualenv works with the right version, and just use pip inside the virtualenv.
