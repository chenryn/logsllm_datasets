We summarize applications of PoL from [20] with a few revisions
and classify them by domains in table 4.
Proof of Solvency. Proof of solvency [7, 13, 19, 25, 32, 73] is
used to prove that a custodial service possesses sufficient assets to
settle all clients‚Äô accounts. Although Bitcoin is gaining population in
using decentralized digital currencies, a large proportion of applica-
tions and tradings still happen in centralized exchanges. As clients
deposit their assets in exchanges, there is a risk of losing money
due to bankruptcy, theft or technical mistakes of exchanges. Clients
have lost billions of dollars worth of bitcoins in exchanges [55].
It is important for clients to be aware of the well functioning of
exchanges and that their deposits are not lost.
In particular, proof of solvency aims to demonstrate ùëôùëñùëéùëèùëñùëôùëñùë°ùëñùëíùë† ‚â§
ùëüùëíùë†ùëíùëüùë£ùëíùë†. It consists of two components, i.e., proof of liabilities and
proof of assets. Proof of liabilities prevents an exchange from cheat-
ing about the total balances of its clients, thus further lower bound-
ing the reported amount of assets when proving solvency. PoL can
be implemented independently from the underlying blockchain pro-
tocol which the corresponding proof-of-assets mechanism depends
on, thus it applies to any blockchain or even traditional banking
systems.
As noted in Provisions [25], proof of solvency doesn‚Äôt prevent
bankruptcy or money theft, but is important for clients to estimate
the status of a financial institution and their own risks. It also has
a potential in mitigating insolvency caused by panic.
Fundraising. Fundraising is the process of aggregating financial
contributions from voluntary individuals or entities for a common
project or goal. Charitable donation is an example of fundraising.
It is critical for the charity to prove that all donations are included
in their total reported amount [66] but there is no easy way. Cur-
rently charities select auditors by themselves for auditing. A study
shows that the willingness of donors are affected by both a charity‚Äôs
reputation and the quality of auditor the charity chooses [45].
PoL enables decentralized auditing without trusting an audi-
tor, which in many donation campaigns doesn‚Äôt exist anyway. It
helps increase transparency while preserving privacy in fundrais-
ing activities, thus further enhance trust and participation. The
main difference between solvency and donations is that some of
the privacy features might be optional in fundraising. For instance,
disclosing the total amount raised or how many donors contributed
might be considered a feature rather than a privacy leakage.
Credit score and financial obligations. Credit score [64] is a
measurement of a person‚Äôs credit risk, i.e., having a higher credit
score indicates that you are more creditworthy, and thus it is easier
for you to get a loan or a lower insurance rate, etc. To compute
an individual‚Äôs credit score, we need all relavent credit reports
covering financial history records including loans and debts.
Usually centralized credit bureaus collect credit reports and use
them to compute credit scores and report to creditors. A hacker
successfully accessing the database of a credit bureau can lead to se-
vere consequences. For instance, data breach [39] of a major bureau
in 2017 resulted in leakage of hundreds of millions of customers‚Äô
personal data.
PoL can be used to allow people to maintain credit scores on
their own and report to creditors directly without third party in-
termediaries. This provides better privacy protection of personal
data. In addition, the PoL commitment of a credit score can also
be combined with other cryptographic primitives, such as MPC,
for comparison (i.e., if it meets a threshold) without revealing the
actual value.
Sales tax reporting. Enterprises have to report revenues at
regular intervals for taxing. PoL can be complementary to the
current auditing system and may mitigate tax evasion by allowing
customers to automatically or voluntarily contribute on verifying
tax liabilities proof for every purchase.
For that to work, each PoL inclusion proof should be considered
a decentralized invoice. Briefly, each signed receipt is an entry in
merchant‚Äôs liabilities data set. Then buyers could have an app to
automatically and privately check the inclusion of their receipts at
the end of the tax year for every purchase they had; and report it
to the tax authorities in case of a mismatch.
Among the others, a high participation from citizens would
eventually lead to less resources required by the tax authorities to
audit companies and as a result IRS for example would no longer
need to issue centralized invoices for taxation.
Obviously, motivations to encourage decentralized participation
from citizens is an interesting topic of research; some ideas include
tax discounts or impacting credit scores for those who contribute.
Moreover, there are cases where dual incentives for applying
PoL aligning with each other. One example is charity fundraising
where apart from the charity‚Äôs PoL, tax payers can automatically
claim charitable tax deduction on donations they make by using
their inclusion proof as proof of expense.

a group of lenders to a large borrower, i.e., a corporation, a project,
or a government. The large loan is jointly contributed by lenders in
the syndicate and the lending risk is shared among them. Usually
there is a lead lender arranging all other lenders and administering
the loan. However, this doesn‚Äôt provide any privacy for lenders.
The total loan amount and the amount lent by each lender is at least
visible to the arranger. In addition, a malicious arranger might fake
the total loan or report inconsistent contribution of each individual
lender.
PoL can be applied to this case and solves the problems above.
The borrower acts as the prover and has no incentive to exaggerate
his total liabilities to lenders. And each lender can check his contri-
bution independently by requesting the corresponding inclusion
proof. The contribution amounts can be concealed, and no arranger
is needed for managing this.
Disapproval voting. Verifiability, i.e., the ability of voters to
check all the cast ballots are correctly tallied in the voting result,
is a critical property in e-voting systems. Yet there is no easy way
to achieve it and there are known attacks against existing e-voting
systems on verifiability, i.e., trash attacks [6] and clash attacks [47].
A disapproval vote is a vote against one or multiple candidates.
If the voting system manager is a stakeholder in some of the candi-
dates, e.g., being or owning the candidates, thus has no incentive to
increase the amount of negative votes, PoL can be applied for veri-
fiability. In particular, PoL allows the manager to prove inclusion
of disapproval votes in the voting result in a distributed manner as
all other applications mentioned above. A voter can find out if the
manager maliciously discards his disapproval vote. In some cases,
the candidates can run the poll for themselves instead of requiring
a third party to run the voting system. And each candidate just
needs to provide PoL proofs to voters to prove that no disapproval
vote is discarded in the final count. The candidates may run an
MPC protocol to output an ordering of the amounts of dispproval
they receive without revealing the exact values.
Note that voting systems are complex and there are many crucial
issues that need to be resolved other than verifiability, e.g., coer-
cion, bribery and sybil attacks. PoL guarantees verifiability under
certain incentive assumptions but need to be combined with other
cryptographic tools, such as anonymous credentials, for building
up a complete solution satisfying other requirements of a voting
system.
Negative reviews/ratings. Similarly to disapproval voting, it
is critical to guarantee verifiability in negative reviews including
reporting illegal behaviors e.g., hate speech, violence promotion,
fake news, or negative reviews and complaints on rating platforms
for commodities, restaurants, services, etc. PoL can be applied to
allow reviewers to check if their negative reviews are properly
included in the rating systems without a centralized auditor.
Again, PoL relies on the assumption that there is no incentive
for the prover to increase the amount of negative reviews, so it is
required that the prover shares similar interests as the reviewed
identity. The reviewee or the owner of the reviewee can generate
PoL proofs on his own without involving a third party, since there
is no incentive for him to maliciously increase the negative rating.
PoL doesn‚Äôt prevent malicious reviewers from rating maliciously
Similar examples of official liability reports include the number
of work accidents in companies [58] and unemployment cases [57].
The common characteristic of the applications above is that the
count represents liabilities and obligations, thus there is no incen-
tive for the counter to overstate the number.
Data accuracy and timeliness are particularly important for pub-
lic good in these applications. PoL can be applied to provide trans-
parent verifiability while preserving confidentiality of people‚Äôs
personal information. Interestingly, authorities of different districts
can also compare the count without leaking their actual values via
MPC. In addition, the hierarchical DAPOL+ could be applied here
particularly to enable hierarchical proofs, where institutions report
to local authorities and in turn local authorities report to the state.
Lottery prizes. Lotteries are a form of gambling and are strictly
regulated even in districts where they are not outlawed by the
government. Usually there is an auditor making sure fairness and
preventing frauds in a lottery. However, there have been reports
