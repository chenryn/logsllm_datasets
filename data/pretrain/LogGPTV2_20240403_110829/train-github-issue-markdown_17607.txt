# Description of the new feature/enhancement
As far as I can see, there is no option to make the cursor see through, like
in Mintty, for example. There is the "emptyBox" cursor shape, but that one
feels very unfamiliar when editing text.
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
Either allow rgba (like in css) in "cursorColor" or add a "cursorOpacity"
option.
