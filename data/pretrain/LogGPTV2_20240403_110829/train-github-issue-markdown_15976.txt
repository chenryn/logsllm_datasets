Subject: Inquiry About Multi-Select Feature for Select Fields and Auto-Complete

Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. I am currently making extensive use of select fields and auto-complete features within my application. As such, I am writing to inquire whether there are any plans to introduce a multi-select option for these components. 

In my experience, the ability to select multiple options from a single field is a highly desirable feature that could significantly enhance functionality and user experience. I believe many developers would greatly benefit from this addition.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
