# Environment
Windows build number: 10.0.18362.239  
Windows Terminal version (if applicable): 0.3  
Relatively clean OS, Ubuntu and WSL installed.
# Steps to reproduce
  1. Open the Terminal app
  2. Close the Terminal app
Only happens when the terminal is closed and PS is the active tab. Does not
happen if Ubuntu or command line is the active tab or if I close a PS tab but
Terminal app stays open.
# Expected behavior
I expect it to close with no errors
# Actual behavior
An error pops out telling me that "PowerShell has stopped working" as in the
screenshot.  
"Standard" PowerShell works just fine.
