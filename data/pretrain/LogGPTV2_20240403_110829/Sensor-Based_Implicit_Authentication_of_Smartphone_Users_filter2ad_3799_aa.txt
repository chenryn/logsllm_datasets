## Abstract
Smartphone user authentication is critical due to the sensitive data stored on these devices and their use in accessing cloud services. However, smartphones are vulnerable to theft or unauthorized access. Continuous re-authentication of users during ongoing access to security-critical services and data is highly desirable. This paper introduces a novel system for implicit, continuous authentication of smartphone users based on behavioral characteristics, utilizing the built-in sensors of smartphones. We propose context-based authentication models to differentiate between legitimate and unauthorized users. Our systematic evaluation demonstrates how to achieve high authentication accuracy through various design alternatives, including sensor and feature selection, machine learning techniques, context detection, and multi-device integration. The system achieves 98.1% accuracy with minimal system overhead and less than 2.4% battery consumption.

## 1. Introduction
The increasing storage of private and sensitive information on smartphones makes them attractive targets for attackers. According to studies, 92.8% of Android smartphone users store private information on their devices [1], [2]. Smartphones also serve as personal computing platforms for accessing cloud services such as e-banking and online social networks. User authentication is essential to prevent privacy, confidentiality, and integrity breaches.

Current login mechanisms, such as passwords and fingerprints, require explicit user participation. Iris scanning [3] and facial recognition [4], [5] are also used for explicit authentication. However, re-authenticating users for very sensitive information via these mechanisms is inconvenient [6]. After the initial authentication, the system does not re-authenticate the user, creating a significant risk for adversaries to gain control of the device and access sensitive data and services.

To address this, we propose SmarterYou, a secure, implicit, and continuous re-authentication system. SmarterYou leverages the built-in sensors of smartphones, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes, and integrates with wearable devices like smartwatches. The system has several advantages over existing methods:
1. **Implicit, Continuous Authentication:** Unlike one-time explicit authentication (e.g., passwords, fingerprints, touchscreen patterns [7], [8]), SmarterYou provides background authentication without user interruption.
2. **No User Permissions Required:** Unlike previous approaches that require permissions for GPS [9] and microphone [10], SmarterYou does not need such permissions.
3. **High Accuracy:** SmarterYou achieves up to 98.1% accuracy, compared to high error rates in some past work [11], [12].
4. **Privacy Protection:** Unlike touchscreen-based methods that can leak sensitive information [13], [14], SmarterYou uses non-intrusive sensors.
5. **Context-Agnostic Design:** Unlike context-specific approaches [15], [16], [17], [12], [18], SmarterYou uses multiple contexts and a context detection method that is user-agnostic.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of our system, covering sensor and feature selection, context detection, multi-device integration, and machine learning algorithms. Our key contributions include:
- **Design of an Implicit Authentication System:** Combining information from smartphones and wearables to continuously monitor and re-authenticate users accurately, efficiently, and stealthily.
- **User-Agnostic Context Detection:** Determining the minimum number of contexts for optimal authentication performance.
- **Systematic Evaluation:** Evaluating design alternatives for efficient authentication, achieving up to 98.1% accuracy with minimal overhead and low battery consumption.

## 2. Background and Related Work
Traditional authentication methods rely on secret information like passwords or physiological biometrics such as fingerprints and iris patterns. Recently, behavior-based authentication has gained attention, leveraging distinct user behaviors for identity verification.

### Touchscreen-Based Authentication
Several studies have explored touchscreen-based authentication:
- Trojahn et al. [17] combined keystroke and handwriting-based mechanisms, achieving 11% FAR and 16% FRR.
- Frank et al. [19] used 22 analytic features from sliding traces, achieving 4% equal error rate.
- Li et al. [20] utilized basic movements on the touchscreen, achieving 95.7% accuracy.
- Feng et al. [21] recorded fine-grained gesture information, achieving 4.66% FAR and 0.13% FRR.
- Xu et al. [22] combined slide, keystroke, handwriting, and pinch gestures for authentication.
- Zheng et al. [23] integrated accelerometer and touchscreen data for PIN entry authentication.

While touchscreen-based methods can be accurate, they can also leak sensitive information [28].

### Sensor-Based Authentication
Other studies have focused on sensor-based authentication:
- Conti et al. [15] used arm movement patterns, achieving 4.4% FAR and 9.3% FRR.
- Kayacik et al. [24] proposed a lightweight, temporally and spatially aware model but did not quantify performance.
- SenSec [11] used accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data, achieving 75% accuracy.
- Nickel et al. [16] used k-NN for accelerometer-based authentication, achieving 3.97% FAR and 22.22% FRR.
- Lee et al. [25] demonstrated improved performance with more sensors, achieving 90% accuracy.
- Yang et al. [26] used hand-waving patterns for authentication, achieving 15% FAR and 10% FRR.

Buthpitiya et al. [9] proposed a geo-based authentication using GPS, which can detect anomalies in user mobility patterns.

## 4. Conclusion
SmarterYou provides a robust, implicit, and continuous authentication system for smartphone users, leveraging built-in sensors and context detection. Our systematic evaluation demonstrates high accuracy, efficiency, and minimal impact on system resources. Future work will focus on further improving the system's adaptability to changing user behaviors and expanding its application to other devices.
