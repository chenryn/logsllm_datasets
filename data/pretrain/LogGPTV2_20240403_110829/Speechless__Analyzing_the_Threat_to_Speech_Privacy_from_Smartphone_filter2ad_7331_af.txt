Fig. 6: Comparison of sensor behavior under ambient locations and in presence of speech in the Phone-Different-Surface sce-
nario. Maximum variance in sensor readings (in absence of speech) at quiet locations 1, 2, 3, 4 is plotted along side maximum
variance in sensor readings (in presence of speech) to determine the effect of speech on sensors. The blue line (maximum
variance in presence of speech) closely follows rest of the lines (that represent maximum variance in absence of speech)
indicating similar behavior of sensors in quiet locations and under the effect of speech from a phone speaker placed on a
different surface.
