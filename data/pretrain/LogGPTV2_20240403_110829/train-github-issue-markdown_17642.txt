#### Description
This maybe a possible bug or my assumption is wrong regarding the Incremental
PCA's fit / partial_fit methods. For valid parameters, the error thrown is
_ValueError: Number of input features has changed from 10 to 100 between calls
to partial_fit! Try setting n_components to a fixed value._
#### Steps/Code to Reproduce
Example:  
I want to perform the pca on the below matrix with dimensions (n_samples,
n_features) = (100, 1000).  
I want to reduce it to a 100 dimension feature space and hence, I am setting
the number of components to 100.
    import numpy as np
    input_matrix = np.random.randn(100, 1000)
    ipca = IncrementalPCA(n_components=100, batch_size=10)
    ipca.fit(input_matrix) # Error at this line
    reduced_matrix = ipca.transform(input_matrix)
#### Expected Results
No error is thrown and the reduced matrix shape must be (n_samples,
n_features) = (100, 100)
#### Actual Results
ValueError: Number of input features has changed from 10 to 100 between calls
to partial_fit! Try setting n_components to a fixed value. Commenting out the
condition check produces expected result.
    if (self.components_ is not None) and (self.components_.shape[0] != self.n_components_):
    	raise ValueError("Number of input features has changed from %i "
    		"to %i between calls to partial_fit! Try "
    		"setting n_components to a fixed value." %
    		(self.components_.shape[0], self.n_components_))
