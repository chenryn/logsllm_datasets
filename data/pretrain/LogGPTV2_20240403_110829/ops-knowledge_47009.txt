User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Are popular browser extensions for anonymity as safe as Tor? There are many different browser extensions that people use in order to hide their IP addresses and protect their anonymity. Can the reliability of these proxy extensions be considered as being on the same level as that of Tor?

Tor works fairly slow, but it is relatively reliable service. Browser extensions allow more quick surfing. Due to the lightness and quickness during work with all these extensions I feel that it is probably not as safe as Tor and I should not consider it as a reliable service for anonymity. But I may be wrong.

Assistant: No. They are different safe than TOR!
Anonymity is complex and there is no "X is better than Y" answer.

If the extension uses a simple unencrypted proxy, for example, everyone between you and the target server can read all your data. The proxy server provider knows your IP and can log everything you do.

If it is a encrypted VPN, between you and the VPN Provider, no one on that path, like your ISP, can read your data. The VPN provider can see all your data, log everything you do and knows your IP.

If you use TOR, the data is encrypted between you and the TOR exit node in multiple layers. The TOR exit node owner (some random person which you can't identify) can read all your data. She doesn't know your IP, but does know everything you send over the connection. There are some malicious exit nodes!

In all cases, everything you do over an unencrypted connection (not https) can be read by someone.
