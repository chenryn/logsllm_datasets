I'm not sure if this is a bug or corruption experienced during the upgrade but
as of 1.2.0, we're now experiencing duplicate results in all queries:
{  
took: 0  
timed_out: false  
_shards: {  
total: 5  
successful: 5  
failed: 0  
}  
hits: {  
total: 2  
max_score: 13.58639  
hits: [  
{  
_index: media6  
_type: Media  
_id: 534918829017389526_260014085,  
_score: 13.58639,  
_source: {}  
},  
{  
_index: media6  
_type: Media  
_id: 534918829017389526_260014085,  
_score: 12.815866,  
_source: {}  
}]  
}}
There have been no changes to indexes, types, or other mappings. My
understanding was that a unique ID really depends on index/type/id/routing.
The routing, by  
default, is derived from the ID. No parent-child relationships are in use
here.
Cross-posted but unrelated to sort as initially suspected:
