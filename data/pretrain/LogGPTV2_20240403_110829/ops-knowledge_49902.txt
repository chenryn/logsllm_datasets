User: Let's say I've written a script in python, program.py. I decide to run this in the Terminal using python program.py. 
This code runs through an exceptional amount of data, and takes several hours to run. 
Is there any way I can check on the status of this code without stoping the program?
Assistant: Ah the classic halting problem: is it really still running?  There is no way to do this if you've already started the program, unless you've written in some debugging lines that check an external configuration for a debug flag (and I assume you haven't since you're asking this question).
You could look to the output or log of the script (if it exists), checking for signs of specific places in the data that the script has processed and thereby estimate the progress of the data processing.
Worst case: stop the thing, add some logging, and start it tonight just before bed.
