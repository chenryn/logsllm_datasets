Pickling `imshow` objects (I'm using them used for heatmaps) fails with the
following error in IPython after `%matplotlib inline` magic has been used. If
inline figures are not set they work as expected.
    UnpickleableError: Cannot pickle  objects
Using `matplotlib.tests.test_pickle.recursive_pickle` fails reporting the
following (similar to #1719):
    Failed to pickle attribute "gridline" in (list/tuple item #0 in (attribute "majorTicks" in (attribute "xaxis" in (list/tuple item #1 in (list/tuple item #1 in (list/tuple item #0 in (attribute "_elements" in (attribute "_axstack" in (top level object))))))))).  Type: 
However, using `matplotlib.tests.test_pickle.depth_getter` its possible to
identify the object that is the cause of the initial error. It's at:
    140628613187224 (8, , u'attribute "_imcache" in (list/tuple item #0 in (attribute "images" in (list/tuple item #1 in (list/tuple item #1 in (list/tuple item #0 in (attribute "_elements" in (attribute "_axstack" in (top level object))))))))')
It looks as though this is a cache of the rendered image. Can these be ignored
when pickling?
