When attempting to pickle `imshow` objects (used for generating heatmaps) in IPython after using the `%matplotlib inline` magic, I encounter the following error:

```
UnpickleableError: Cannot pickle <object>
```

If the inline figure setting is not used, pickling works as expected. Additionally, running `matplotlib.tests.test_pickle.recursive_pickle` results in a failure, with the following message (similar to issue #1719):

```
Failed to pickle attribute "gridline" in (list/tuple item #0 in (attribute "majorTicks" in (attribute "xaxis" in (list/tuple item #1 in (list/tuple item #1 in (list/tuple item #0 in (attribute "_elements" in (attribute "_axstack" in (top level object))))))))).  Type: <type>
```

Using `matplotlib.tests.test_pickle.depth_getter`, it is possible to identify the specific object causing the initial error. The problematic object is located at:

```
140628613187224 (8, , u'attribute "_imcache" in (list/tuple item #0 in (attribute "images" in (list/tuple item #1 in (list/tuple item #1 in (list/tuple item #0 in (attribute "_elements" in (attribute "_axstack" in (top level object))))))))')
```

This appears to be a cache of the rendered image. Is there a way to exclude this cache when pickling?
