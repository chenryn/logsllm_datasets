## 3. Observations

1. **Receiver Sensitivity Variability**: The receiver sensitivity varies within a ±1 dB range due to multipath distortion, noise floor variation, and other interference mechanisms.
2. **DTV Receiver #3 Sensitivity**: DTV Receiver #3 consistently showed higher de-sensitisation, attributed to its more sensitive tuner and susceptibility to multipath distortion.
3. **Signal Reflections and Multipath Effects**: Signal reflections within the building created standing waves, resulting in up to 3 dB higher received signal levels compared to free-space propagation. Multipath effects increased with distance from the transmitter.
4. **NTSC vs. DTV Sensitivity**: NTSC receivers experienced more de-sensitisation than DTV receivers, likely due to NTSC's higher S/N requirement.
5. **Narrowband Interference Impact**: A narrowband interference signal positioned across the NTSC channel followed the "S" curve, with increased sensitivity at the color sub-carrier location.

## 4. Test Procedure

### 4.1 Setup
- **RF Channel Selection**: Choose an RF channel between CH14 and CH51, ensuring minimal off-air interference in co- and first adjacent channels.
- **Interference Emissions**: 
  - Wideband emission (5.6 MHz BW)
  - Narrowband emission (0.429 MHz BW)
  - Mediumband emissions (1.3 MHz BW)
  - Three narrowband emissions (3x0.43 MHz) distributed over the 6 MHz channel
- **Interference Signal Power Level**: Set to 3 dB below the FCC emission limit (P(dBm) = -75.5 + dBuV/m – 20 log(Frequency in MHz)).
- **Wanted Signal**: ATSC DTV and NTSC, using TOV as the test threshold.

### 4.2 DTV Test
- **3 Meters Test**: Measure off-air interference, adjust interference power, and find TOV with and without interference.
- **12 Meters Test**: Repeat the 3 meters test at 12 meters.
- **24 Meters Test**: Repeat the 3 meters test at 24 meters.

### 4.3 NTSC Test
- **6 and 18 Meters Test**: Repeat the 3 meters test at 6 and 18 meters with NTSC as the wanted signal.
- **Narrowband Interference Test**: Transmit the interference signal at several in-band frequency locations across the 6 MHz channel.
