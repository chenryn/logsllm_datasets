It was noticed that the receiver sensitivity varies in a +/-1 dB range for different test points.  This 
is attributed to one or all of these factors: multipath distortion, noise floor variation and other 
interference mechanisms.  It was also noticed that DTV Receiver #3 always showed a higher de-
sensitisation than other DTV receivers.  This is attributed to Receiver 3 having a more sensitive 
tuner and being more susceptible to the multipath distortion (requiring a higher S/N under 
multipath environment). 
It was also observed that signal reflection within the building created standing waves. The result 
of this phenomenon was that the received signal could be up to 3 dB higher than what it would 
be for free-space propagation.  There were also signal “nulls” in the room, which could result in 
signal level drops of several dB over small changes in location.  Moreover, multipath effects 
were observed to increase as the distance from the transmitter was increased.

De-Sensitisation of DTV Receivers by UD Sideband Signals Transmitted Through A 
Wall.
In these tests, the interference signals were transmitted through one wall before reaching the 
DTV receivers.  The walls are typical interior office fire protective dry wall. 
The calibration was done at 3 m as explained in the test procedure in Annex 1. Tests were 
conducted on Off-Air channel 48 (674 – 680 MHz). The interfering signal power was adjusted to

be at -89.1 dBm/120 kHz at 3 meters from the receivers. The receivers tested using this 
interference source are listed in Annex 2.
The results of the test using the various DTV receivers each separated from the interference 
source by one wall such that the DTV receiver was 5 m from the interference source which was 
3m from the wall are presented in Table 4.

Similarly, tests were conducted at 12 m the results of which are shown in Table 5. For this case 
the test were conducted with and without a wall between the interference source and the DTV 
receivers.
The test results show that the interference signal is attenuated by about 3-6 dB, when going 
through a typical fire rated office drywall.

De-Sensitisation of NTSC Receivers in an Indoor Environment
The NTSC and the interference signals were transmitted and received in the same room. The 
calibration was done at 3m as explained in the test procedure in Annex 1. The interference signal 
Communications Research

MSTV Tests – Page 13
power was adjusted to obtain -86.1 dBm/120 kHz at 3 meters.  The lists of the NTSC receivers 
used in the tests are also presented in Annex 2. 
The de-sensitisation tests were carried out on CATV channel 66 (474 – 480 MHz) equivalent to 
UHF off-air Channel 14 and 15.  (Note: a cable TV NTSC modulator was used in the test, as an 
off-air NTSC modulator was not available. However, this should have no impact on the test 
results, since there is only a slight frequency range difference, the signal modulation is the same).  
The results are presented in Tables 6 and 7 for tests conducted for distance of 6m and 18m 
respectively.  The greater than sign “>” indicates that de-sensitisation was beyond the limits of 
the test-bed.

The test results show that there is more desensitisation for NTSC than that of DTV. This is most 
likely because the NTSC system requires a higher S/N to operate. 
The test also shows that the NTSC Receiver 2 requires 5-10 dB more power (sensitivity) than 
Receiver 1 and 3 for TOV and ITU-R Grade 3.

De-Sensitisation of NTSC Receivers with the Narrowband Signal Transmitted 
Across NTSC Band 
The purpose of this test was to study the impact of a narrowband interfering signal positioned at 
various frequencies across the NTSC channel would have on the NTSC signal itself.
Communications Research 
Centre Canada 
MSTV Tests – Page 14
The NTSC signal and the narrowband interference signal were transmitted and received in the 
same room. The calibration was done at 3m as in previous cases. The interference signal power 
was then adjusted to obtain -86.1 dBm/120 kHz at 3 meters. The test for this case was completed 
with only the NTSC receiver #1 (see the list of the NTSC receivers in Annex 2). 
Again, CATV Channel 66 (474 – 480 MHz), which is equivalent to UHF off-air Channels 14 and 
15, was used for the test. Table 8 presents the test results at 6m and at different frequencies 
across the NTSC channel. An NTSC visual signal RF subjective weighting curve shown in 
Figure 7 was used as reference for the interference calculation. Figure 7 shows that the NTSC 
visual signal is most sensitive to interference positioned between 1.5 and 2.5 MHz above the 
lower channel edge.

Figure 7. NTSC Visual Signal RF Subjective Weighting Curve (“S” Curve). 
The test results match well with the NTSC visual signal weighting curve (“S” curve), except at 
the colour sub- carrier location (about 4.75 MHz from the lower channel edge), where it is more 
sensitive to the interference.  This is because the colour-bar test pattern, which is very sensitive 
to the colour sub-carrier interference, was used for the subjective assessment. 
3.5 Cable Ingress Created by the UD Sideband Signals 
The purpose of these tests was to determine the possible cable ingress created by the interfering 
signals.
For these tests, an indoor portable UD was assumed. This UD was set to transmit a 100-mW 
wideband signal through a Silver Sensor antenna with about 5-dB gain. The closest distance 
between the antenna and the cable was about 1 meter. Two types of cable were used. One being 
an RG-6 double shielded cable; and the other an RG-59 single shielded cable. The length of the 
cable used in the test was about 10 meters. The cable was stretched across a room with one end 
connected to a Vector signal analyser for ingress signal power measurement. Tests were 
conducted with the other end of the cable either terminated in its characteristic impedance or un-
terminated.  The results of the tests are presented in Table 9.

The results confirmed, as expected, that the double shielded RG-6 cable will pick up 
interference, if it is not terminated (in our test the un-terminated cable end is about 5m away 
from the transmitting antenna).  RG 6 cable is probably the most widely used cable for home 
installation of cable TV and Satellite TV systems.  For the case of the single shielded RG-59 
cable, the test show that regardless of weather it is terminated or not, significant ingress 
interference was detected. RG 59 is often used by non-professionals to install additional cable 
outlet at home.

Findings & Observations 
1. To avoid measurement errors, the interference signal level was set at 3 dB below the FCC 
recommended emission limit, thus, the actual receiver desensitisation could be up to 3 dB 
higher than the measurement results. 
2. For different interfering signal bandwidth, the results are very much proportional to the 
interference signal bandwidth. For example, the wideband interference signal, 5.6 MHz BW, 
will cause 10 log (5.6/0.43) = 11.1 dB more desensitisation than a narrowband interference 
signal with a 0.43 MHz bandwidth.  Test results show that, for each DTV receiver, the 
discrepancy is within +/- 1 dB over calculated results (see Table 1, 2, and 3).  When 
desensitisation is small as shown in Table 3, the power calculation method is not accurate, 
since the receiver noise floor will impact the desensitisation.  For example, if the interference 
is at the same level as the receiver noise floor, the desensitisation will be 3 dB rather than 0 
dB.
3. It is interesting to note that a 1.3 MHz bandwidth interfering signal has almost the same 
impact as three individual 0.43 MHz (3 x 0.43 = 1.29 MHz) interference signals (+/- 1 dB 
accuracy) spread across a TV channel as shown in Tables 1 and 2.
4. Indoor multipath reflection forming standing waves, which results in signal peaks and nulls 
over few inches distance (RF frequency dependent) were observed.  The peak can be 3 dB 
above free space propagation curve, while nulls can easily cause several dB of signal loss.  
The further away from the UD, the greater the potential for multipath reflection, which could 
cause possible desensitisation in extended areas. 
5. There was more desensitisation for the case of NTSC than for that of DTV. This result is 
expected, since the NTSC system requires higher S/N than the DTV system to operate. 
6. A narrow band interference signal located in an NTSC channel follows the behaviour of the 
“S” curve.

ANNEX 1: TEST PROCEDURE 
Test Procedure for Unlicensed Devices Interference Signal Emissions into the ATSC DTV 
and NTSC Channel. 
Set Up: 
•
Select an RF channel between CH14 and 51. 
-Make sure there are minimum off-air interference in co- and first adjacent channels. 
•
Interference emissions signals:  
1. Wideband emission signal, 5.6 MHz BW 
2. Narrowband emission signal, 0.429 MHz BW 
3. Mediumband emissions signals, 1.3 MHz BW 
4. Three narrowband emissions signals distributed over the 6 MHz channel, 3x0.43 MHz 
•
Interference signal power level set up: 
-   FCC emission requirement: 200 uV/m, or 46 dBuV/m within a 120 kHz BW. 
-   Convert to dBm: P(dBm) = -75.5 + dBuV/m – 20 log(Frequency in MHz)  
-   The emission signal level should be measured at 3m from the unlicensed devices, within a 
120 kHz BW. 
-   The signal level should be 3 dB below the above calculated emission level P(dBm) to 
avoid possible measurement errors.  Since allowed interference signal power is calculated and 
fed to the receiver directly, the type of antenna used for transmission and reception is irrelevant. 
•
Wanted signal:
-   ATSC DTV and NTSC. 
-   TOV is used as the test threshold. 
-   Test point: 3m, 12m and 18m away from the unlicensed devices. 
-   Tests will also be done with signals transmitted thought a wall. 
-   Television channel multipath distortion should be minimum. 
DTV TEST 
1. Test at 3m with wideband and narrowband interference emissions signals: 
•
At 3m, measure the off-air interference level (co- and first adjacent-channels), and the 
equipment noise level in 6 MHz and in 120 kHz bandwidth; 
•
Adjust interference emission signal power level, measured 3m away, to be P(dBm) – 3 dB 
over the 120 kHz BW; 
•
Turn off the interference, transmit ATSC DTV, and find TOV, record the transmitted signal 
power level in 6 MHz and in 120 kHz bandwidth; 
•
Turn on the interference emission signal. If DTV reception is not possible, increase the DTV 
signal power level until TOV, record the DTV Tx signal power level in 6 MHz and 120 kHz 
bandwidth. The difference between the DTV signal power level with and without the 
interference emission signal is the receiver de-sensitisation.

MSTV Tests – Page 18
2. Test at 12m: 
•
Keep the interference emission signal power unchanged and moves the test point to 6m. 
•
Repeat the 3m test. 
•
The result will be the de-sensitisation at 6m. 
3. Test at 24m: 
•
Keep the interference emission signal power unchanged and moves the test point to 24m,  
•
Repeat the 3m test. 
•
The result will be the de-sensitisation at 24m. 
NTSC TEST 
•
Keep the interference emission signal power unchanged, repeat test at 6m, and 18m with 
NTSC as the wanted signal. 
•
For narrowband interference test, the interference emission signal should be transmitted at 
several in-band frequency locations across 6 MHz channel. 
•
NTSC signal power is measured as peak average power.
