### Sensor Cluster Data Transmission and Power Management

The decision for a Sensor Cluster to transmit data is based on the perceived "interestingness" of the data. Typically, the cluster transmits at a 0.1 Hz rate to conserve power. However, if the data becomes interesting, the transmission rate increases to 1 Hz. This prioritizes capturing critical information over battery life, as losing the ship would be more detrimental than depleting the battery.

At a lower frequency (0.01 Hz), the Sensor Clusters activate their receivers, resynchronize, and determine whether they need to receive downlink data. If required, they process the downlink frame. This operational scheme ensures that the clusters spend 97% of their time in sleep mode, with only a timer running to generate the next wake-up. The radio transmitter is off 99.8% of the time, and the receiver is off 99.99% of the time. To achieve this, the radio was designed to be highly power-efficient and capable of transitioning from dormancy to operation within milliseconds. Additionally, transducers were chosen to minimize warm-up periods.

### Use of MEMS-Based Transducers

MEMS-based transducers offer advantages such as low power consumption, high reliability, and stability, which are crucial for low-maintenance operation. MEMS sensors are used for temperature, humidity, pressure, differential pressure, acceleration, and strain. Conventional sensors, which are less power-efficient and bulkier, are used for oxygen, carbon monoxide, photoelectric, and ionization measurements. These non-MEMS sensors are the primary factors limiting the volume and power utilization of the Sensor Clusters.

### Radio-Frequency Communication

RSVP radios operate in the 2.4 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band, allowing unlicensed operation and the use of readily available components and small antennas. Several distinct protocols are employed, tailored to the characteristics of the devices and the nature of the messages.

The choice of communication protocol at each interface is influenced by the power requirements of the units involved, as summarized in Table 2. Other considerations include the required data rate and the appropriateness of connection-oriented or connectionless interfaces. Data transfers between Sensor Clusters (SCs) and Access Points (APs) benefit from connection-oriented communication, ensuring service levels during damage events when many SCs transmit at the highest rate. In contrast, data transfers between Personnel Status Monitors (PSMs) and APs are naturally connectionless to maintain responsiveness as the wearer moves around the ship. Consequently, three different protocols are used within the 2.4 GHz band, as detailed in Table 3.

For communication between SCs and APs, and between PSMs and APs, the band is divided into 142 continuous-wave channels. Two of these channels use an Aloha media-access method without acknowledgment. These channels, one primary and one backup, are used throughout the ship. Using Aloha, senders transmit asynchronously without checking the channel's status, resulting in a low-power, connectionless communication method. However, some messages may be lost due to concurrent transmissions. The RSVP implementation of Aloha does not include acknowledgments or retransmissions to minimize power consumption, as no single data sample is critical enough to warrant retransmission.

The remaining 140 channels are used for uplink and downlink communication with SCs, operated in a time-division multiplex fashion. Each AP has exclusive use of a single channel for both uplink and downlink, with frequency reuse in compartments far enough apart to avoid interference. On each channel, SCs are assigned specific time slots in a repeating 1 Hz frame. They can choose to transmit or not during their reserved slot, allowing for a 1 Hz transmission rate when the data is interesting and a lower rate (0.1 Hz or less) otherwise.

### Wired-Network Communication

RSVP communication over the shipâ€™s LAN follows a publish/subscribe paradigm. Access Points (APs) receive sensor data directly from the subset of Sensor Clusters (SCs) they communicate with and subscribe to data from other APs in the same compartment. A Watchstation subscribes to the necessary data, including alarms, and displays relevant information when an alarm is generated. The Watchstation obtains video by subscribing to it, with the connected AP acting as the publisher.

### Redundancy, Fault Tolerance, and Survivability

The RSVP concept employs more Sensor Clusters and Access Points than the minimum required, achieving three objectives:
- **Spatial Diversity:** Increased data sources for data fusion algorithms, reducing false alarms and missed detections.
- **Graceful Degradation:** No immediate repair or replacement unless a compartment suffers a disproportionate number of failures.
- **High Survivability:** A single AP can communicate with 100 SCs and 100 PSMs, ensuring continued operation even if all APs in a space are damaged or compartment boundaries are destroyed.

Sensor Clusters are generally not internally redundant, but two specific sensors in the ESCs are replicated:
- **Thermistor:** One thermistor is triplicated to improve data fidelity. Onboard logic selects either the middle value or the mean of the two closest values.
- **Oxygen Sensor:** Due to its limited lifetime, the oxygen sensor is also replicated to ensure reliable operation.
