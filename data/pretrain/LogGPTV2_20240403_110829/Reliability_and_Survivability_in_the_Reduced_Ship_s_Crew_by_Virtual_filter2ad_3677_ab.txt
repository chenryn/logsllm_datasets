Sensor  Cluster  decides  to  transmit  or  not  depends  on 
whether the data is judged to be “interesting.”  Typically 
the Sensor Cluster transmits at a 0.1 Hz rate to conserve 
power, but if the data suddenly becomes interesting it will 
transmit at a 1-Hz rate.  (It is preferable to run the battery 
down than to lose the ship.)  At a lower frequency (0.01 
Hz),  the  Sensor  Clusters  enable  their  receivers,  resync, 
determine whether they are required to receive downlink, 
and  if  so  receive  and  process  a  downlink  frame.    This 
scheme  results  in  Sensor  Clusters  spending  97%  of  the 
time  in  the  sleep  mode,  with  just  a  timer  running  to 
generate  the  next  wake  up,  99.8%  of  the  time  with  the 
radio transmitter being off, and 99.99% of the time with 
the  radio  receiver  being  off.    To  achieve  this,  it  was 
necessary  to  design  a  radio  that  not  only  made  efficient 
use  of  power  when  on,  but  also  that  could  be  brought 
from dormancy to operation in milliseconds.  It was also 
necessary  to  choose  transducers  that  could  be  sampled 
with minimal warm-up periods. 
The use of MEMS-based transducers provides benefits 
of  small  power  consumption,  high  reliability,  and  high 
stability,  all  of  which  contribute  to  low-maintenance 
operation.    MEMS  sensors  were  used  where  readily 
available: for temperature, humidity, pressure, differential 
pressure,  acceleration,  and  strain.    Conventional  sensors 
were  used  where  MEMS  devices  were  unavailable:  for 
oxygen,  carbon  monoxide,  photoelectric,  and  ionization.  
The  non-MEMS  sensors  were  the  limiting  factors  in 
determining SC volume and power utilization. 
2.2.  Radio-frequency communication 
RSVP  radios  operate 
in 
the  2.4-GHz 
industrial, 
scientific,  and  medical  band,  which  allows  unlicensed 
operation and the use of readily available components and 
small  antennas,  namely.    Several  distinct  protocols  are 
employed,  due  to  differences  in  characteristics  of  the 
devices involved and the nature of the messages. 
The choice of communication scheme at each interface 
is  influenced  by  the  power  requirements  of  the  units  at 
each  end,  which  are  summarized  in  Table  2.    Other 
considerations  that  dictate  the  choice  of  communication 
are  the  required  data  rate  and  whether  a  connection-
oriented or connectionless interface is appropriate.  Data 
transfers  between  SCs  and  APs  lend  themselves  to 
connection-oriented  communication,  because  a  service 
level  can  be  guaranteed  during  a  damage  event,  when  a 
large  number  of  Sensor  Clusters  transmit  at  the  highest 
rate.  Data transfers between PSMs and APs are naturally 
connectionless,  because  it  would  degrade  responsiveness 
to  continually  establish  and  break  down  connections  as 
the wearer moves about the ship.  The upshot is that three 
different  protocols  are  employed  within  the  2.4-GHz 
band, as summarized in Table 3. 
For  communication  between  Sensor  Clusters  and 
Access Points and between PSMs and APs, the band has 
been divided into 142 continuous-wave channels.  Two of 
these  channels  are  operated  with  an  Aloha  media-access 
method without acknowledge.  These same two channels, 
one a primary and the other a backup, are used throughout 
the ship.  
Using  Aloha,  a  sender 
transmits  asynchronously 
without first monitoring the channel to determine whether 
it is in use.  This results in a low-power, connectionless 
means  of  communicating.    However,  a  percentage  of 
messages  will  be 
transmitting 
concurrently.   
to  senders 
lost  due 
The RSVP implementation of Aloha is unconventional 
in that there are no acknowledgements or retransmissions.  
Acknowledgements  were  avoided  to  minimize  power 
consumption.   A sender  will  soon send another  message 
with  similar  content,  and  no  one  data  sample  is  so 
important that it cannot be lost.   
The Aloha channels are used by PSMs to uplink data, 
and  are  the  means  by  which  a  Sensor  Cluster  finds  out 
which  channels  are  being  used  for  SC  uplink  by  nearby 
Access Points.   
The remaining 140 channels are used for uplink from 
and  downlink  to  Sensor  Clusters.    These  channels  are 
operated  in  a  time-division  multiplex  fashion,  with  each 
AP  having  exclusive  use  of  a  single  channel  for  both 
uplink and downlink.  Frequency reuse is employed where 
compartments are  far enough away  that there  will be  no 
interference.    On  each  channel,  Sensor  Clusters  are 
assigned a particular time slot in a repeating frame (1 Hz) 
by  the  channel’s  AP,  and  thereafter  have  the  option  of 
transmitting or not transmitting during that reserved time 
slot.    This  scheme  allows  a  Sensor  Cluster  to  transmit

Communication  between  SHM  and  AP  is  carried  out 
using commercial radios operating under the IEEE 802.11 
standard.  Commercially available 802.11 AP software to 
perform network management is installed in every AP of 
the  compartments  that  contain  machinery.    An  SHM 
communicates  with  a  single  AP  in  the  compartment.    If 
that AP fails, another AP in the compartment takes over 
the communication function. 
Communication  between  ICHM  and  SHM  is  also 
carried  out  using  commercial  radios  operating  under  the 
IEEE  802.11  standard. 
  ICHM/SHM  and  SHM/AP 
communication  employ  different  spreading  strategies, 
which allows both to use 802.11 without interfering with 
each other.

sensor data corresponding to the subset of Sensor Clusters

subscribing  to  that  data.    This  data  is  a  function  of  the 
active displays on the Watchstation.  At the highest level, 
the Watchstation subscribes to alarms and has nothing to 
do  until  an  alarm  is  generated.    When  an  alarm  is 
generated,  there  is  a  need  at  the  Watchstation  to  display 
information  about  that  alarm  and  to  display  information

When  a  Watchstation  subscribes 
in  a 
compartment,  any  Access  Point  in  the  compartment  has 
the  capability  to  publish  it.    The  APs  designate  one 
member of their group, the “prime,” to do the publishing.  
If  the  “prime”  fails,  one  of  the  other  APs  in  the 
compartment takes over this function. 
A Watchstation obtains video by subscribing to it.  The

2.4.  Redundancy, fault tolerance, and 
survivability 
The RSVP concept employs more than the minimal set 
of Sensor Clusters and Access Points needed to meet the 
sensor monitoring requirements.  This accomplishes three 
objectives: 
·  Spatial  diversity  of  transducers  with  increased  data 
sources for data fusion algorithms.  This results in a 
lower number of false alarms and missed detections. 
·  Graceful degradation following failures.  There is no

suffered 
·  High  degree  of  survivability.    A  single  AP  can 
communicate  with  100  SCs  and  100  PSMs.    This 
allows  the  system  to  continue  functioning  with  a 
single  surviving  AP  in  a  compartment.    Operation 
continues even if all APs in a space are damaged or 
compartment boundaries are destroyed. 
For  the  most  part,  Sensor  Clusters  are  not  internally 
redundant  because  it  is  necessary  to  install  redundant 
units  for  survivability.    Two  particular  sensors  were 
replicated in the ESCs. 
·  Thermistor:    One  thermistor  was  triplicated  to 
demonstrate  the  use  of  redundancy  to  improve  the 
fidelity  of  the  data.    Logic  onboard  the  Sensor 
Cluster performs a selection algorithm and provides 
a  single  temperature  value,  either  the  middle  value 
or the mean of the two values closest together.
