After Loading in the page, without changing any code, there are two #Target5's
on the left-well. As soon as any code is changed on the page, the 2nd #Target5
goes away, and if you delete any code you have put on there, as well as "reset
to default" it comes back. Doing a hard refresh does not change this.
