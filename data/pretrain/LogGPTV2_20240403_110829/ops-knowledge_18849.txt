User: How to implement distributed locks in the application? Please provide code implementation and detailed description.
Assistant: Distributed locks can be implemented using distributed coordination tools, such as ZooKeeper or Redis. Let's take Redis distributed lock as an example to explain. The implementation process of Redis distributed lock: 1. Call the setnx(key, value) method of Redis to set the key to the specified value. 2. The return value of the setnx method is 1, indicating that the setting is successful and the lock is acquired successfully. 3. The return value of the setnx method is 0, indicating that the key has been occupied by other threads, and the lock acquisition failed. 4. After the lock acquisition fails, you can retry, wait, or directly return an error according to business needs. 5. After successfully acquiring the lock, execute the business logic and call the del(key) method of Redis to release the lock. The following is the code implementation of the Redis distributed lock, including the method of locking and releasing the lock: ``` public class RedisLock { private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(RedisLock.class); private JedisPool jedisPool; public RedisLock(JedisPool jedisPool ) { this.jedisPool = jedisPool; } /** * Add lock * @param key lock name * @param timeout lock timeout (unit: millisecond) * @return whether the lock is successfully acquired */ public boolean lock(String key, long timeout) { Jedis jedis = jedisPool.getResource(); long start = System.currentTimeMillis(); try { while (true) { // Call the setnx method to try to lock Long result = jedis.setnx(key, "" + start ); if (result == 1L) { // lock successfully, set the expiration time of the key to avoid deadlock jedis.expire(key, (int) (timeout / 1000)); LOGGER.info("lock success! key :{}", key); return true; } // Failed to acquire the lock, wait for a period of time and try again Thread.sleep(100); if (System.currentTimeMillis() - start > timeout) { // Timed out when trying to acquire the lock LOGGER.warn("get lock timeout! key:{}", key); return false; } } } catch (InterruptedException e) { LOGGER.error("lock error! key:{}", key, e); return false; } finally { jedis.close(); } } /** * Release the lock* @param key the name of the lock*/ public void unlock(String key) { Jedis jedis = jedisPool.getResource(); try { jedis.del (key); LOGGER.info("unlock success! key:{}", key); } finally { jedis.close(); } } } ``` Note that there may be problems with Redis locks: 1. Competition condition problem under high concurrency: If multiple threads call the lock method at the same time and acquire the lock at the same time, there will be a competition condition problem, which needs to be solved by using a more refined locking mechanism. 2. Lock invalidation problem: If the thread acquiring the lock exits abnormally or is blocked after the lock is successfully added, the lock may become invalid. In this case, manual lease renewal or reentrant lock is required to solve the problem.
