User: After installing Apache, MySQL and PHP on a Linux server, how to test whether these services are working properly?
Assistant: You can use the following steps to test whether Apache, MySQL and PHP work normally: 1. Test whether Apache works normally: open a web browser, enter the IP address or domain name of the server, if you can see the default page of Apache, Apache is working normally. 2. Test whether MySQL works normally: use the command line or GUI tool to connect to the MySQL database server. If you can successfully connect and execute the SQL statement, MySQL is working normally. 3. Test whether PHP is working properly: Create a simple PHP file and add the following code to it: <?php phpinfo(); ?> Save the file and upload it to the web root directory of Apache, then access the file in your browser , if you can see the relevant information of PHP, then PHP is working normally. If one of the services fails to work properly, you need to check the configuration files, log files, etc., and troubleshoot the problems one by one.
