question and mitigate the eﬀect of this type of caching on our
measurement analysis, we conduct a series of experiments.
First, we collect a list of commonly searched keywords (e.g.,
“mobile cloud computing”) as listed in the drop-down “search
suggestion box” used by both Bing and Google. We also gen-
erate a list of search words not listed by the suggestion bar.
A total of 40,000 keywords are used in the experiments. We
perform two sets of experiments. In the ﬁrst set, all mea-
surement nodes submit the same search query sequentially
to a ﬁxed FE server. In the second set, each node submits
a diﬀerent search query to a ﬁxed FE server. We repeat the
experiments with diﬀerent search queries and vary the FE
server used. Analysis and comparison of the measurement
results (in particular, the characteristics and distributions
of Tdynamic) suggest that FE servers do not appear to cache
any (dynamically generated) search result. This may not be
too surprising, as most search engines attempt to personalize
search results for individual users.
4. DISSECTING END-USER PERFORMANCE
In this section, we present the analysis of search query
traces collected by us using Bing and Google. In particular,
we use the model described in Sec. 2 to extract the Tstatic
and Tdynamic from the traces. We present our methodology
to understand how the round trip delay between user and FE
web servers aﬀects the distribution of Tstatic and Tdynamic.

4.1 Extracting & Analyzing Tstatic and Tdynamic
Guided by the basic abstract model in Sec. 2, we per-
form temporal analysis of the packet-level events at the user
(client) side using the collected packet traces.
Figure 4
plots ﬁve sample timelines of packet generation and recep-
tion events at the client side, where ﬁve PlanetLab nodes
are used as clients, each submitting the same search query
to the Bing FE server. The x-axis represents the elapsed
time since the start of the session, when the ﬁrst TCP SYN
packet is sent to the FE web server. The y-axis represents
the round trip time (RTT) between the client and the FE
server. Each horizontal array of dots/markers represents the
timeline of packet-level events, where each blue cross/red
dot marker indicates the sending/receiving time of a TCP
packet. When RTT values are small, the temporal clus-
ters of packet events are clearly visible: correlating with the
application-layer packet payloads, we ﬁnd that the ﬁrst clus-
ter represents the three-way TCP handshake between the
client and the FE server; the second and third cluster rep-
resent the delivery of static and dynamic contents, respec-
tively, from the server to the client. As the RTT increases,
the gap between the end of the second and the beginning
of the third clusters decreases, and eventually the two are
lumped together, as predicted exactly by our model.
Using the datasets B collected via the second type of ex-
periments (see Sec. 3) conducted for both Bing and Google,
we extract and analyze the parameters Tstatic, Tdynamic and
Tdelta. Figure 5 shows the distribution of these parameters
using a sample of measurement data for one Bing FE server
(IP address 198.189.255.208) and one Google FE server (IP
address 74.125.224.18), where 720 repeated experiments us-
ing the same search query are performed over time at each
PlanetLab node. In these plots, x-axis represents the RTT
between a PlanetLab node and the FE server, while y-axis
represents the median value of Tstatic, Tdynamic and Tdelta
observed at each of the PlanetLab nodes. With a few out-
liers, the leftmost plot shows that for both Bing and Google,
Tstatic is relatively stable and is largely independent of the
PlanetLab node that had sent the query. Similarly, Tdynamic
is roughly a constant when RT T is small. However, when
RT T is large, Tdynamic increases linearly with RT T .
In
the case of Tdelta, when RT T is small, it decreases linearly
with RT T ; and it becomes zero when RT T is beyond a cer-
tain threshold (for Google, this threshold is around 50ms to
100ms, for Bing, around 100ms to 200ms).
All these observations can be explained using our simple
abstract model. First note that in the deﬁnition of Tstatic,
we have subtracted the (initial) eﬀect of RT T . Hence Tstatic
depends mostly on the time to generate and deliver the
(same) static content portion at the FE server (assuming the
available bandwidth and the server load seen by all the Plan-
etLab node is roughly the same). When RT T is small, the
delivery of the static content portion will be ﬁnished before
the FE receives the dynamically generated search result from
the BE data center (the time at which this is received at the
FE server is independent of where the client is). Hence when
RT T is small, Tdynamic is roughly a constant while Tdelta de-
creases as a function of RT T . When RT T increases beyond
a certain threshold, the dynamic content portion will be re-
ceived by the FE server before the static content portion is
entirely delivered to the client. Hence Tdynamic increases as
a function of RT T (due to the TCP window mechanism),
while Tdelta becomes zero. The observations therefore match
the prediction by our simple abstract model. Our analysis
also suggests that below a certain threshold, reducing the
RTT further will not drastically improve the overall user
perceived performance.

Comparing RTT Distributions. In Figure 6, we com-
pare the RTTs between the PlanetLab nodes and their de-
fault FE servers (as determined by the DNS resolution). As
seen in this plot, in general, Bing has FE servers (Akamai
CDN servers) which are closer to PlanetLab nodes than for
Google. In particular, more than 80% of PlanetLab nodes
observe an RTT of less than 20ms for reaching the Bing FE
servers. On the other hand, only 60% of PlanetLab nodes
observe this latency for Google.

for both Google and Bing. As seen in this ﬁgure, although
the Bing FE servers are generally closer to the clients (Plan-
etLab nodes), it has signiﬁcantly higher value of Tstatic and
Tdynamic than Google. In contrast, Google has slightly far-
ther FE servers from the clients, but has signiﬁcantly lower
Tstatic and Tdynamic. In addition, Bing exhibits more vari-
able performance (i.e., higher variances) in the measured
values of Tstatic and Tdynamic than Google. These results
illustrate that placing FE servers closer to clients does not
necessarily reduce Tstatic and Tdynamic. We speculate that
a plausible reason that Bing has higher and more variable
Tstatic values may be due to the higher and more variable
loads at the Akamai FE servers, as they are shared with a
number of other services; while that Google FE servers have
smaller and more stable Tstatic values may be attributed to
the fact that these servers are likely dedicated to distribution
of search results. Similarly, the Tdynamic values for Bing FE
servers are larger, and have more variability. The contribut-
ing factors may involve the processing capability and load
ﬂuctuations on the BE data centers, the search algorithm
being used, the quality of the connection between FE and
BE servers, e.g.
loss rate, jitter, throughput, etc. A dedi-
cated connection between FE and BE servers via “internal”
network usually provides better connection than that built
on the general Internet connections.

we compare the overall responsive time for individual search
queries performed on both Bing and Google, as shown in Fig-
563ure 8. The x-axis represents the PlanetLab nodes, and the y-
axis represents the box-plot for the distribution for diﬀerent
samples. The results show that comparing Google, users us-
ing the Bing search service tend to experience slightly longer
and more variable overall response times.
