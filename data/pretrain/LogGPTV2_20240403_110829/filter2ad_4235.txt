ABSTRACT
With the introduction of femtocells, cellular networks are
moving from the conventional centralised architecture to a
distributed one, where each network cell should make its
own radio resource management decisions, while providing
inter-cell interference mitigation. However, realising this dis-
tributed cellular network architecture is not a trivial task.
In this paper, we (cid:12)rst introduce a simple self-organisation
rule under which a distributed cellular network is able to
converge into an eﬃcient resource allocation pattern, then
propose a novel resource allocation model taking realistic re-
source allocation constraints into account, and (cid:12)nally eval-
uate the performance of the proposed self-organisation rule
and resource allocation model using system-level simulations.

1. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION
Femtocells, which are low-cost, low-power cellular base
stations (BSs) deployed by end-users in homes and oﬃces,
have been widely considered as a cost-eﬀective solution to
enhance indoor coverage and spectral eﬃciency in cellular
networks. By reducing the distance between BSs and end-
users and alleviating the traﬃc burden on macrocells, femto-
cells can potentially improve spatial reuse, allow higher user
data-rates and provide energy savings. However, femtocell
roll-outs are facing their own technical challenges. For in-
stance, since the user-provided backhaul connection between
an femto BS and the operator’s core network usually has lim-
ited capacity, it is diﬃcult to manage inter-cell interference
using classic centralised network planning and optimisation
tools. This has led to a new inter-cell interference manage-
ment problem that must be solved in a decentralised and
distributed manner. However, to achieve good performance
across the network with each cell taking its own radio re-
source management decisions is an intricate problem [1].
2. RADIO RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
In orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)
-based networks, e.g., Long Term Evolution (LTE) and Wire-
less Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), the
smallest resource unit that can be assigned is a resource
block (RB). An RB is comprised of a set of adjacent sub-
carriers in the frequency domain and OFDM symbols in the

time domain. The scheduling question to be addressed by
each cell is how RBs are to be allocated to users and how
much transmit power is to be applied to each RB, so that
network capacity is enhanced. This radio resource allocation
problem is complex because users may have diﬀerent quality
of service demands and may experience various channel and
interference conditions in each RB. Moreover, both LTE and
WiMAX standards have a scheduling constraints, e.g., when
more than one RB are allocated to a user, all these RBs must
utilise the same Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) [2].
3. OUR SELF-ORGANISATION RULE
For the independent and dynamic optimisation of radio
resource assignments at each cell, it is necessary to have an
objective that results in a good self-organising behaviour.
Accordingly, our proposed cell optimisation rule is de(cid:12)ned
as: each cell assigns MCSs, RBs and transmit power levels
to users independently, while minimising the cell total trans-
mit power and meeting its users’ throughput demands. The
reasons for minimising the cell total transmit power are two:
1. A cell that aims at minimising its own transmit power
mitigates inter-cell interference to neighbouring cells,
because less power is allocated to those users with
good channel conditions or lower throughput demands.
This is straightforward from Shanon-Hartley theorem.
2. A cell that aims at minimising its own transmit power
tends to allocate those RBs that are not being used by
its neighbouring cells, because less transmit power is
required for a less interfered and/or faded RB to get a
targeted signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR).
Following this rule, a cell will tend to allocate users that
are closer to the BS or have lower data-rate requirements
(hence requiring lower MSCs as well as transmit powers)
to RBs that are used by cell-edge users in neighbouring cells.
4. RESOURCE ALLOCATION MODEL
The transmit power pf
u;k;r that femtocell Ff should assign
to every subcarrier of RB k assign in the downlink to user u
to achieve the SINR threshold (cid:13)r of its assigned MCS r is
u;k;r = (cid:13)r (cid:1) wu;k + (cid:27)2
pf
(cid:0)f;u
(1)
(cid:0)f;u is the channel gain between femto BS Ff and user u,
wu;k is the inter-cell interference power suﬀered by user u in
RB k, and (cid:27)2 is the noise power. Femtocell Ff can ‘know’
(cid:0)m;u and wu;k from its user measurement reports (MRs) [2].
Thus, the joint MCS, RB and power allocation problem in
femtocell Ff , following our proposed self-organisation rule,
can be formulated as the following integer linear problem:

for each MCS assignment to cell users, the optimal RB and
power allocation can be found by using our network sim-
plex algorithm. Since network simplex runs fast, RB and
power allocations to users can be updated on a millisecond
basis (dealing with fast channel variations), while the MCS
assignment can be updated in a half-second basis (dealing
with traﬃc load and mobility).
5. PERFORMANCE AND CONCLUSIONS
The performance of the proposed self-organisation rule
has been investigated in an enterprise femtocell scenario
(Fig. 1). Simulation results show that compared to exist-
ing radio resource management techniques in the literature,
i.e., random [3], network listening mode (NLM) [4] and in-
terference minimisation (IM) [5], our approach is able to
signi(cid:12)cantly decrease the number of user outages, increase
the average number of simultaneously transmitting users in
the network (around 15%), and enhance the average network
sum throughput (around 12%) (Tab. 1). This is because our
approach (self-organization rule) achieves inter-cell interfer-
ence coordination without the need of assigning orthogonal
RBs among neighbouring cells. Instead, it allows all cells to
allocate all RBs to their users in an intelligent manner: A cell
that minimises its own transmit power assigns less power to
those RBs allocated to users having good channel conditions
or with lower data-rate demands. Thus, neighbouring cells
will ‘see’ low interference in such RBs and will allocate them
to users having bad channel conditions or with large data-
rate demands, thereby improving spatial reuse. To illustrate
this self-organising feature, Fig. 2 shows the transmit power
allocated by 3 neighbouring femtocells at a given time in
8 available RBs. We can see that each femtocell tends to
allocate higher power levels in RBs in which neighbouring
femtocells assign lower power levels and vice versa. In this
way, a same RB can be dynamically reused in neighbouring
femtocells. Therefore, our proposed se(cid:13)-organisation rule
and resource allocation model eﬀectively introduce an im-
plicit coordination among independently operating femto-
cells through distributed dynamic radio resource allocations.

where (cid:31)u;k;r (2g) is a binary decision variable that is equal to
1 if user u uses MCS r in RB k, or 0 otherwise, (cid:26)u;r (2f) is a
binary decision variable that is equal to 1 if user u makes use
of MCS r, or 0 otherwise, constraint (2b) makes sure that
RB k is only assigned to at most one user u, constraints (2c)
and (2d) together guarantee that each user is allocated to
at most one MCS, and constraint (2e) makes sure that each
user u obtains a throughput no less than its demand T P req
u .
Average channel quality in the form of instantaneous wu;k
averaged over tens of user MRs is utilised to compute pf
u;k;r,
thus avoiding rapid (cid:13)uctuations of pf
u;k;r due to fast-fading,
which may result in fast variations of resource assignments.
One possible approach to solve (2) is to apply integer lin-
ear programming (ILP) techniques readily available in soft-
ware packages. However, although ILP solvers are able to
solve (2) up to optimality, their running times are unpre-
dictable (exponential in the worst case), which renders them
inappropriate for real-time use at femto BSs. Hence, to solve
(2) in short time, we propose a two-level decomposition ap-
proach based on an heuristics search and a minimum cost
network (cid:13)ow problem. Assuming that a MCS ru has been as-
signed to user u 8u, i.e., (cid:26)u;r8u8r is known a priori as part of
the input, (2) can be reduced to a simpler form, i.e., a user-
8u8k. This
to-RB assignment problem weighted by pf
assignment problem can be formulated as a minimum cost
network (cid:13)ow problem, an optimally solved using a network
simplex algorithm. Thereafter, a heuristic search can be
performed over the MCS assignment solution space, where
