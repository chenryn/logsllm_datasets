User: Describe the TCP three-way handshake process and its functions.
Assistant: The TCP three-way handshake is a protocol step when the TCP protocol establishes a connection. It is mainly used to enable the two ends of the communication to confirm their communication sequence number (SEG.SEQ) and window size (WND) to ensure that the two ends can communicate normally. The process of the TCP three-way handshake is as follows: 1. The first handshake (SYN): The client sends a SYN message to the server, where SYN = 1, indicating a request to establish a connection, and the client selects an initial SEQ (Initial Sequence Number) sequence Number. 2. The second handshake (SYN/ACK): After receiving the SYN message, the server sends SYN and ACK messages to the client, where SYN = 1, indicating that the connection is requested, and ACK = 1, indicating that the client has been confirmed The SYN message of the client, and the server also selects an initial SEQ. 3. The third handshake (ACK): After receiving the SYN and ACK messages from the server, the client sends an ACK message to the server, where ACK = 1, indicating that it has received the message from the server, and the connection is established at this time success. The role of the TCP three-way handshake: 1. Confirm that both parties support the TCP protocol: the SYN message tells the server that the client requests a connection, and the SYN/ACK message tells the client that the server supports the TCP protocol. 2. Mutual confirmation of the initial sequence number of the connection: Both the server and the client select an initial SEQ, so that in subsequent communications, they can confirm whether the received data is correct and orderly. 3. Confirm the window size of both parties: The window size (WND) refers to the maximum value that data can be sent, and the window size of both parties can be confirmed by the three-way handshake.
