I would appreciate it if the zone editor included an option to specify which monitor's zones are being edited. While there may be a current method to achieve this, I believe the process should be simplified for users who are less technically inclined. A straightforward solution would be to allow selection between "Monitor 1" and "Monitor 2," as identified in the Windows display settings.

I have encountered significant difficulties in configuring the zones on my secondary, vertically oriented monitor and have yet to find a simple solution. Any advice on how to resolve this issue would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.
