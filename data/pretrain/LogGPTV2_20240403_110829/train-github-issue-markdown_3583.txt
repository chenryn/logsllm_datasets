If possible I would love to see an option for which monitor the zone editor is
editing zones for. Even if there is a proper way to do it, I feel it should be
simplified for less tech-savvy people. Just a simple Monitor 1 and Monitor 2,
identified in the Windows display settings would work fine.  
It's been a hassle to get it to work on my other vertical monitor and I
haven't found a simple solution to this day.
Any feedback on how I could fix my problem currently would be appreciated!  
Thank you
