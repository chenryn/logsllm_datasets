Barcodes have been around for decades. They are the vertical lined images printed on various products that 
allow registers to identify the product and price. Today’s barcodes are much more advanced and can contain a 
large amount of text data within a small image. Some newer barcodes exist in order to allow individuals to scan 
them with a cell phone. The images can provide a link to a website, instructions for downloading a program, or 
a secret text message. I generally advise against scanning any unknown barcodes with a mobile device since 
malicious links could be opened unknowingly. However, an online barcode reader can be used to identify what
This site allows you to upload a digital image. After successful upload, it will display the image in normal view. 
Below this image will be a darkened duplicate image. Any highlighted areas of the image indicate a possible 
manipulation. While this site should never be used to definitively state that an image is untouched or 
manipulated, investigators may want to conduct an analysis for intelligence purposes only. Figure 21.07 displays 
original and manipulated images while Figure 21.08 displays the analysis of the images from Foto Forensics. 
This site will provide an analysis of an image from die internet or a file uploaded from a computer. It is important 
to note that any images uploaded become part of the website's collection and a direct URL is issued. While it 
would be difficult for someone to locate the URL of the images, it could pose a security risk for sensitive files.
Figure 21.06 displays die barcode search options from Online Barcode Reader. These include ID, PDF417, 
Postal, DataMatrix, QR, and ID barcodes. After selecting the type of barcode image, you can select any PDF, 
TIFF, JPEG, BMP, GIF, or PNG file on your computer up to 4Mb in size. This could be a photo that possesses 
a barcode in the content or a digital code downloaded from a website. Screen captures of codes also work well. 
While sitting on a plane with Wi-Fi, I captured a photo of an abandoned boarding pass in the magazine holder 
in front of me. The barcode reader identified text information stored inside the code that was not present in 
text on the document.
It is common to find images on die internet that have been manipulated using software such as Photoshop. 
Often it is difficult, if not impossible, to tell if these photos have been manipulated by visually analyzing diem. 
A handful of websites use a technique to determine which portions of the photo have changed.

The Magnifier allows you to see small hidden details in an image. It does this by magnifying the size of the 
pixels and the contrast within the window. There are three different enhancements available at the moment: 
Histogram Equalization, Auto Contrast, and Auto Contrast by Channel. Auto Contrast mostly keeps the colors 
intact; the others can cause color shifts. Histogram Equalization is the most robust option. You can also set this 
to none.
Forensically is a robust image analyzer that offers a huge collection of photo forensic tools that can be applied 
to any uploaded image. This type of analysis can be vital when image manipulation is suspected. Previous tools 
have offered one or two of the services diat Forensically offers, but this new option is an all-in-one solution for 
image analysis. Loading the page will present a demo image, which is used for this explanation. Clicking the 
"Open File" link on the upper left will allow upload of an image into your browser for analysis. Images arc NOT 
uploaded to the server of this tool; they are only brought into your browser locally. Figure 21.09 (left) is the 
standard view of a digital photo. The various options within Forensically are each explained and example images 
arc included. Due to the black & white environment of this book, I have replicated all of this instruction in color 
on my blog at the following address.
The Clone Detector highlights copied regions within an image. These can be a good indicator that a picture 
has been manipulated. Minimal Similarity determines how similar die cloned pixels need to be to the original. 
Minimal Detail controls how much detail an area needs; dierefore, blocks with less detail than this are not 
considered when searching for clones. Minimal Cluster Size determines how many clones of a similar region 
need to be found in order for them to show up as results. Blocksize determines how big the blocks used for the 
clone detection arc. You generally don't want to touch diis. Maximal Image Size is the maximal width or height 
of the image used to perform the clone search. Bigger images take longer to analyze. Show Quantized Image 
shows the image after it has been compressed. This can be useful to tweak Minimal Similarin* and Minimal 
Detail. Blocks that have been rejected because they do not have enough detail show up as black. Figure 21.09 
(right) demonstrates this output.

Luminance Gradient analyzes the changes in brightness along the x and y axis of the image. It's obvious use 
is to look at how different parts of the image arc illuminated in order to find anomalies. Parts of the image which
Level Sweep allows you to quickly sweep through the histogram of an image. It magnifies the contrast of certain 
brightness levels. To use this tool simply move your mouse over the image and scroll with your mouse wheel. 
Look for interesting discontinuities in the image. Sweep is the position in the histogram to be inspected. You 
can quickly change this parameter by using die mouse wheel while hovering over the image, this allows you 
sweep through the histogram. Width is the amount of values (or width of the slice of the histogram) to 
inspected. The default should be fine. Opacity is the opacity’ of the sweep layer. If you lower it you will see more 
of the original image.
Noise Analysis is basically a reverse dc-noising algorithm. Rather than removing the noise it removes the rest 
of the image. It is using a super simple separable median filter to isolate the noise. It can be useful for identifying 
manipulations to the image like airbrushing, deformations, warping, and perspective corrected cloning. It works 
best on high quality images. Smaller images tend to contain too little information for this to work. Noise 
Amplitude makes the noise brighter. Equalize Histogram applies histogram equalization to the noise. This can 
reveal things but it can also hide them. You should try both histogram equalization and scale to analyze the 
noise. Magnifier Enhancement offers three different enhancements: Histogram Equalization, Auto Contrast, 
and Auto Contrast by’ Channel. Auto Contrast mostly’ keeps the colors intacr; the others can cause color shifts. 
Histogram Equalization is the most robust option. You can also set this to none. Opacity is the opacity of the 
noise layer. If you lower it you will see more of the original image. The result can be seen in Figure 21.10 (right).
Error Level Analysis compares the original image to a rccompressed version. This can make manipulated 
regions stand out in various ways. For example, they can be darker or brighter than similar regions which have 
not been manipulated. ) PEG Quality should match the original quality of the image that has been photoshopped. 
Error Scale makes the differences between the original and the rccompressed image bigger. Magnifier 
Enhancement offers different enhancements: Histogram Equalization, Auto Contrast, and Auto Contrast by 
Channel. Auto Contrast mostly keeps the colors intact; the others can cause color shifts. Histogram Equalization 
is the most robust option. You can also set this to none. Opacity displays the opacity’ of the Differences layer. 
If you lower it you will see more of the original image. Figure 21.10 (left) displays manipulation.

MetaData displays any Exif metadata in the image. Geo Tags shows the GPS location where the image was 
taken, if it is stored in the image. Figure 21.12 displays the result.
This option requires a free account, and only magnifies the overall image. It simply doubles everything in size. 1 
have not found this extremely valuable.
There may be times when you have an image of poor quality which you may wish to enhance. Typically, this is 
not advised since you may be manipulating evidence, but there are scenarios where this may be justified. A blurry’ 
image of a license plate or address could warrant the manipulation of an image for clarity. Let's look at two 
options.
The next time you identify’ a digital image as part of your online investigation, these tools will peek behind the 
scenes and may display evidence of tampering.
Thumbnail Analysis shows any hidden preview image inside the original image. The preview can reveal details 
of the original image or the camera used. Figure 21.13 displays the online image (left) while the original thumbnail

are at a similar angle (to the light source) and under similar illumination should have a similar color. Another 
use is to check edges. Similar edges should have similar gradients. If the gradients at one edge are significantly 
sharper than the rest it's a sign that the image could have been copied and pasted. It does also reveal noise and 
compression artifacts quite well. Figure 21.11 (left) displays this view.
PCA performs principal component analysis on the image. This provides a different angle to view the image­
data which makes discovering certain manipulations and details easier. This tool is currently single threaded and 
quite slow when running on big images. Choose one of the following Modes: Projection of the value in the 
image onto the principal component; Difference between the input and the closest point on the selected 
principal component; Distance between the input and the closest point on the selected principal component; or 
the closest point on the selected principal Component. There are three different enhancements available: 
Histogram Equalization, Auto Contrast, and Auto Contrast by Channel. Auto Contrast mostly keeps the colors 
intact; the others can cause color shifts. Histogram Equalization is the most robust option. You can also set this 
to none. Opacity is the opacity’ of the sweep layer. If you lower it you will see more of the original image. Figure

This option does not require an account and uses various software programming to truly enhance an image. In 
2021,1 uploaded a blurry vehicle with a license plate which barely identified half of die digits. This tool clarified 
two additional digits which led to die discovery of the full registration.
I do not recommend manually typing this all into a web browser. It would be more efficient to navigate to each 
image search site and paste the photo URL. However, 1 have created an online tool that automates this entire 
process. The first search options replicate the reverse-search techniques explained for Google, Bing, TinEye, 
andex, Baidu, and KarmaDecay. The final option on this page executes keyword searches across all popular 
networks into separate tabs on your browser. Figure 21.14 displays the current state of this tool.

Many people use YouTube as a social network, leaving comments about videos and participating in discussions 
about various topics. If you locate a video of interest, it is important to also retrieve this text information. Each 
comment below a video will include the username that created the comment, which will link to that user’s profile.
Online videos may now be more common than online photographs. The cameras in smart data phones can act 
as video cameras. In some situations, uploading a video to the internet is easier than a photograph. Most social 
networks now act as independent video hosts for their platforms. Video sharing sites such as YouTube have 
made video publication effordess. For investigations, a video can contain a huge amount of intelligence. When 
any abnormal event happens, people flock to their phones and start recording. These videos may capture 
criminal acts, embarrassing behavior, or evidence to be used in a civil lawsuit. Obtaining these videos is even 
easier than creating them.
Several YouTube videos have been tagged as violent, sexual, or otherwise inappropriate for young viewers. 
Others demand that you log in to a Google account in order to view the content for unclear reasons. Either 
way, this is an unnecessary roadblock to your investigation. As an OS1NT investigator, I prefer to not be logged 
in to any personal or covert account while I am researching. Any time you are searching through a Google 
product while logged in to an account, Google is documenting your ever}7 move. This can be unsetding. One 
easy technique should remove this restriction. Navigate to the folloxring website and notice the inability to view 
the video. If you are not logged in to a Google account with a verified age, you should see a warning about
