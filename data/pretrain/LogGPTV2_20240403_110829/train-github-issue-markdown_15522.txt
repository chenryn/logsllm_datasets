Hello,

After researching various frameworks, I found Playwright to be one of the best options for UI test automation. My requirements include automating tests on desktop browsers (real browsers), mobile browsers, and mobile applications on both Android and iOS. Does Playwright support these requirements?

I understand that Playwright primarily supports browser-level emulation. If I have missed any information or if there is additional support available, please let me know.

Thank you.
