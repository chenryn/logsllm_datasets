MoveWithMe: Location Privacy Preservation
for Smartphone Users
Jian Kang , Doug Steiert, Dan Lin , and Yanjie Fu
Abstract— With the prevalence of
smartphones, mobile
websites have been more and more popular. However, many
mobile websites collect the location information which greatly
increases users’ risks of being tracked unexpectedly. The cur-
rent location access control setting is not sufﬁcient since it
cannot prevent the service providers which have been granted
location-access permissions from tracking the users. In this
paper, we propose a novel location privacy preservation mobile
app, called MoveWithMe, which automatically generates decoy
queries to hide the real users’ locations and intentions when
they are using location-based mobile services. Unlike the existing
works on dummy trajectories which may be easily discovered
by attackers through data analysis, the uniqueness of the Move-
WithMe app is that our generated decoys closely behave like
real humans. Each decoy in our system has its own moving
patterns, daily schedules, and social behaviors, which ensures
its movements to be semantically different from the real user’s
trace and satisfying geographic constraints. Thus, our decoys
can hardly be distinguished even by advanced data mining
techniques. Another advantage of the MoveWithMe app is that it
guarantees the same level of user experience without affecting the
response time or introducing extra control burdens. Decoys move
independently in the back end and automatically submit queries
to the same service provider whenever the user does so. Our
proposed MoveWithMe app has both iOS and Android versions
and has been tested on different brands of smartphones against
various location-based services, such as Yelp and TripAdvisor.
Experimental results demonstrate its practicality, effectiveness,
and efﬁciency.

Location Based Services (LBSs). While many users typically
do not explicitly recognize these services being used, they are
also unaware of the risks that are associated with them. Such
loose control on location data by existing mobile websites
has caused different types of privacy threats. To name a few,
an adversary who learns the locations that a person visited may
gain clues of that person’s daily movement pattern, hobbies,
political afﬁliations, and medical problems.
To mitigate risks to users’ location privacy when they are
visiting location-based services on their smartphones, several
strategies have been proposed. One typical approach is to
add an access control mechanism to control
the location
disclosure to the selected service providers such as the loca-
tion privacy settings in iOS and Android systems. However,
such access control approaches [1] do not prevent service
providers which have been granted location access permissions
from tracking the users. In order to provide better privacy
protection, some approaches [2] have been proposed based
on the spatial-temporal cloaking or k-anonymity. The basic
idea is to let
the user submit a bigger region instead of
the exact location to the service provider when requesting
location-based services. In this way,
the service provider
may only have some rough ideas about where the user is
around but is not able to pinpoint the user’s exact location.
However, the existing spatial-cloaking-based approaches have
limited protections against the attacks that exploit aggregated
information collected via continuous queries to obtain the
moving trends and even narrow down possible places that
a user has visited. Another common approach for location
privacy preservation is to generate dummy trajectories. How-
ever, existing algorithms for dummy generations [3]–[7] are
still vulnerable to attacks that employ data mining techniques
such as the sequential pattern mining as reported in [4]. This is
because the dummies are mostly randomly generated with very
little consideration of the real-world geographical constraints
and behavior patterns. Moreover, existing works lack the
considerations of the user experience on how to adopt these
location privacy preservation mechanisms in the real world
settings.
To overcome the aforementioned limitations, in this paper,
we present a novel location-privacy preservation mobile app,
called MoveWithMe. It is called MoveWithMe since it auto-
matically generates a number of decoys to move with the user
like real human beings and serve as distractions to the service
providers. In the MoveWithMe system, each decoy has its
own moving patterns, favorite places, daily schedules, social

behaviors, etc. Based on the user’s privacy needs, the initial
number of decoys,
the decoys’ social and travel patterns,
and their personalized proﬁles can be varied. Unlike previous
dummy-based approaches which only generate dummies in
the nearby region and the same city where the real user is
located, our decoys may be in the same city as the user, or
in different cities of different countries in order to further
confuse the attackers about the locations of the real user. The
factors such as GPS error and changing of speed are also
considered. In this way, the user’s privacy is protected since
the attackers or service provider will not be able to identify
the real user’s trajectories out of all the decoys’ trajectories
to proﬁle the real user. Figure 1 depicts the real user (say
Bob)’s trajectory in New York City who uses the Move-
WithMe system to help generate four decoys’ trajectories in
three different cities in different countries. With the activated
MoveWithMe system running in the background, the decoys
continuously move throughout the day as real humans. In the
example, Decoy1 will follow a postman’s daily routine and
may visit many houses, Decoy2 is a lawyer who may visit
clients during the day, and Decoy3 and Decoy4 will move
based on their proﬁles as a teacher and a student, respectively.
As time passes, when Bob has been to his research lab and
a fast food restaurant, his decoys may have visited residential
areas, other schools, hotels, pizza places, parks, etc. Whenever
Bob visits a location-based service website such as Yelp,
the MoveWithMe will intercept Bob’s request before it goes
out to the location-based service, mix Bob’s request with other
simulated requests from the four decoys, and then send ﬁve
requests altogether to Yelp. Even if Bob continuously access
the same location-based service, the service provider will still
have a hard time to discover Bob’s locations out of ﬁve
trajectories that demonstrate different moving patterns, jobs,
social behaviors, etc. In order to prove the effectiveness of the
privacy protection offered by MoveWithMe, we show in our
experiments that the users’ real trajectories are well hidden
among decoys’ trajectories since they are not only impossi-
ble to be distinguished from decoys’ trajectories visually by
humans, but also hard to be distinguished by advanced data
mining techniques that the attackers or service providers may
use. Our contributions are summarized as follows:
• Compared with existing dummy generation algorithms,
our algorithms to the generation of decoys are funda-
mentally different and much more sophisticated. In our
system, the decoys are not only geographically different
but also semantically different from the real user’s tra-
jectories. Moreover, to closely mimic real humans, our
generated decoys not only follow real humans’ social
behavior proﬁles but also integrate a variety of uncertainty
that could happen in the real human trajectories. For
example, among a consistent set of frequent places to be
visited by a decoy throughout days and weeks, we also
consider reasonable changes of moving speed and stay
time, possible GPS errors, and occasionally change of
behavior such as change of restaurants for lunch.
• Compared with most of the existing location privacy
preservation approaches, our system is more practical.
We have built the prototype of the proposed MoveWithMe
system in both iOS and Android systems. The Move-
WithMe app guarantees the same level of user experience
without affecting the response time or introducing extra
control burdens to users. It is capable of intercepting any
location-based services and providing the privacy preser-
vation for users in real time without any involvement of
a trusted third party or central server.
• In the experiments, we evaluated the MoveWithMe sys-
tem against a variety of existing location-based services
such as Yelp and TripAdvisor in different brands of smart-
phones. The experimental results demonstrate feasibility,
effectiveness, and efﬁciency.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
reviews related works. Section III presents the details of our
proposed MoveWithMe system. Section IV conducts privacy
analysis. Section V reports the experimental results. Section VI
discusses the limitations of this system. Lastly, Section VII
concludes the paper.
II. RELATED WORK
Various approaches have been proposed to preserve location
privacy, which can be classiﬁed into four main categories:
A. Spatial-Temporal Cloaking Based Approaches
The key idea of spatial-temporal cloaking is to generate a
cloaking region that contains the user’s real location and K −1
other users. In this way, the service provider would not be
able to distinguish the K users in the same region and hence
users achieve K -anonymity. The idea was ﬁrst introduced
by Gruteser and Grunwald [8] and later has been extended
by many [9]–[14] with different ways of generating the

cloaking regions. Although this kind of approaches can hide
the user’s exact location, the coarse location information of
the user such as the user’s moving trend is still not well
protected. For example, even though the attackers cannot know
the exact location of the user’s home, it is still possible for
them to know which city the user lives, and the approximate
trajectory of the user by connecting the cloaking regions.
Lin et al. [15] propose a remedy solution that transforms
all the real locations to a new domain, which fully prevents
the leak of the exact and continuous locations but can only
support limited types of queries such as queries on the friends’
locations.
B. Differential Privacy Based Approaches
Another way to hide the user’s exact locations from the
service provider is to utilize the differential privacy theory
to add noises to the users’ real
locations. Andres et al.
apply Laplacian noise to location data in a discrete Carte-
sian plane in [16]. In this model, users are able to adjust
the level of the desired privacy, which in turn increases or
decreases the amount of noise added to the location data.
Chen et al. [17] propose to adjust noises based on unob-
servability and a Kalman ﬁlter. Xiao et al. [18] propose to
adjust the privacy protection levels based on users’ location
proﬁle and mobility history. Ngo and Kim [19] introduce
the differential privacy geo-indistinguishability notion that
help reduce the average size of cloaking regions. Similarly,
Wang et al. [20] also use differential geo-obfuscation to hide
the user’s exact location. Although these differential based
approaches can obfuscate the user’s locations,
the noises
that are added to the location data still need to be limited
to ensure the service quality. That means the adversaries
will still be able to know the city where the user lives,
the approximate user trajectories, the time pattern of the user’s
daily routine, and hence be able to proﬁle the user. Moreover,
by observing non-sensitive contexts, the adversary may also
be able to infer the user’s sensitive information as pointed
out in [21].
C. Encryption Based Approaches
The encryption-based approaches aim to fully preserve the
location privacy by encrypting the location data and conduct-
ing queries directly on the encrypted data. One representative
work is by Ghinita et al. [22] who propose a framework
to support private nearest neighbor queries based on Private
Information Retrieval. Puttaswamy and Zhao [23] propose to
encrypt location coordinates before sharing which ensures
that only designated users can decrypt the location informa-
tion. Huang et al. [24] use smartphones to perform secure
multi-party computation over users’ location data. Wei et al.
in [25] propose a system named MobiShare to support the
location sharing among trusted friends and untrusted strangers
while preserving user’s location privacy. Guha et al. [26]
introduce a privacy-preserving framework which provides a
cloud-based matching service to return attributes and their
values in an encrypted fashion. In [27], Li and Jung devise a
privacy-preserving location query protocol which encrypts the
location data using Pallier encryption to ensure that adversaries
cannot intercept transmitted data. Later, Puttaswamy et al. [28]
attempt to preserve location privacy in geo-social applications.
To improve query efﬁciency, Paulet et al. [29] combine oblivi-
ous transfer and private information retrieval techniques. Based
on the improved homomorphic encryption, Zhu et al. [30]
present a query framework in which users can query LBS
results in a polygon range without leaking the information
of the query polygon. These encryption-based approaches
can provide a strong privacy guarantee of user’s location
information. However, to support the encryption-based fea-
tures, the current architecture of the LBS server and client
have to be signiﬁcantly changed, which may not be eas-
ily deployed in the near future due to the capital cost
involved.
D. Dummy-Based Approaches
This category of work is most
related to ours. The
dummy-based approaches generate dummies and send fake
locations along with the user’s real location to the service
provider so as to protect the user’s location privacy [31]. For
example, Niu et al. [3], [32] propose dummy swapping and
dummy selection strategies. Xue et al. [33] propose to place
