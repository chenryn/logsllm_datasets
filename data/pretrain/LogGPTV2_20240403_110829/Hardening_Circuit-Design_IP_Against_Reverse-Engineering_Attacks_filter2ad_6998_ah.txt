(X0( ˆF ) = (X1(H) \ S0) ∪ S1.)
By construction, the hamming weight of all functions in
RL will fall in the window [hw(H) − ∆, hw(H) + ∆], i.e.,
hw( ˆF ) ∈ [hw(H) − ∆, hw(H) + ∆] for all ˆF ∈ RL.
Since F 0
[h,h] comprises of functions with hamming weight
h only, we can construct
by only keeping
functions ˆF ∈ RL whose hw( ˆF ) = h. That is, for each
, the hamming weight of ˆF will satisfy:
|X1(H)|−|S1(H, ˆF )|+|S0(H, ˆF )| = h. Also, by construction

of OneChaffhd, the total number of distinguishing inputs will
be ∆. Hence, |S1(H, ˆF )| + |S0(H, ˆF )| = ∆. Solving these
two equations, and using hw(H) = h + α gives us:
|S1(H, ˆF )| = (∆ + α)/2;|S0(H, ˆF )| = (∆ − α)/2.
These equations tell us that given H, each function ˆF in the
set F[h,h]∩RL has (∆ + α)/2 distinguishing inputs in X1(H)
and (∆ − α)/2 distinguishing inputs in set X0(H). Total
number of such functions will be Bin (|X1(H)|, (∆ + α)/2)×
Bin (|X0(H)|, (∆ − α)/2), where α = hw(H) − h and
|X0(H)| = 2n − hw(H) in the previous equation gives us
the ﬁnal bound in the claim. (cid:4)

Proof of Claim 2. We will use the sets Xi(F ) and Si(F, H) =
Si = I(cid:54)=(F, H) ∩ Xi(F ), where i ∈ {0, 1}, to deﬁne Xi(H)
similar to how we used sets Xi(H) and I(cid:54)=(F, H)∩Xi(H) to
deﬁne Xi(F ) in the proof of Claim 1. Note that the set Xi(F )
is used as the base function in this proof; in Claim 1, we used
Xi(H) as the base function. Following the same three steps as
in the proof of Claim 1, we will get X1(H) = (X1(F )\S1)∪S0
and |X1(H)| = |X1(F )| − |S1| + |S0|.
Next, we need bounds on Si’s. Before that, observe that
the set I(cid:54)=(F, H) = {X1, X2, . . . , X∆} is a random variable
that follows a uniform distribution, i.e., I(cid:54)=(F, H) ←$ (Un)∆.
Since hw(F ) = h, Pr[ X ∈ X1(F ) ] = h/2n, and
Pr[ X ∈ X0(F ) ] = 1 − h/2n, where X ←$ I(cid:54)=(F, H).
Now, the size of Si, i.e., |Si| is a random variable that
is binomially distributed, with E[|S1|] = µ1 = ∆(h/2n) and
E[|S0|] = µ0 = ∆(1−h/2n). By a standard Hoeffding bound,
we have, for all  > 0, Pr[|Si| ≥ µi + ∆ ] ≤ exp(−2∆2).
Setting  = (cid:112)(ln ∆)/∆, we get with probability at most
∆ ln ∆
1/∆2, Pr
. We can write this other-
wise as: Pr
with probability at least
1− 1/∆2. We will assume that the bounds on Si are tight; we
will reﬂect the uncertainty in the claim/theorem statements.
Using the bounds on Si in |X1(H)| = |X1(F )| − |S1| + |S0|,
we get
|X1(H)| = |X1(F )| − (µ1 +
∆ ln ∆) + (µ0 +
