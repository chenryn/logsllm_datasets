User: Please explain the difference between HTTPS and HTTP, and why you need to use HTTPS when transmitting sensitive information?
Assistant: HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a protocol for data transmission over the network in an encrypted manner. Compared with HTTP, the HTTPS protocol adds SSL/TLS encryption technology to protect data security during data transmission, ensuring that data is not tampered with, eavesdropped and forged. The HTTPS protocol uses a public key encryption algorithm to realize end-to-end encrypted transmission. When transmitting sensitive information, such as user account passwords, bank card numbers and other private information, there are certain risks in using the HTTP protocol, because the data transmission of the HTTP protocol is in clear text, which is vulnerable to hacker attacks and data leakage risks. Using the HTTPS protocol, the encryption technology protects the security of the data and disrupts the data during transmission, making it impossible to be intercepted and analyzed by malicious code, thus effectively protecting the privacy and data security of users. Therefore, the HTTPS protocol can provide more secure data transmission and protect user information and privacy.
