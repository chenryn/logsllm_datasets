Question: A mobile security auditor is evaluating an iOS application's compliance with best practices for user privacy. They claim that unlike earlier versions of Android, iOS has always utilized runtime permissions, asking users to grant permissions as the app attempts to use a sensitive API for the first time. Is this statement accurate, and why might an auditor need to understand this system when assessing an application?
"A": "True, understanding this permissions system allows the auditor to verify that the application properly requests permissions at runtime, which is crucial for user privacy and security.",
"B": "False, iOS applications have pre-assigned permissions and do not request permissions at runtime, thus making the auditor's understanding irrelevant.",
"C": "True, but only because iOS applications request all permissions upfront at installation, making runtime permissions irrelevant.",
"D": "False, although iOS uses runtime permissions, the auditor's understanding is only relevant for assessing permissions on Android devices."
Answer: A
