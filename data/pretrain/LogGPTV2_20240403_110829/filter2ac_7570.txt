### Title: BotConf 2020 - An Overview of the Botnet Simulation Framework

Botnet research often focuses on the analysis of active botnets, which limits researchers' ability to test detection and tracking mechanisms against potential future threats. This limitation is particularly pronounced in the domain of peer-to-peer (P2P) botnets, where configuration parameters, network churn, and anti-tracking mechanisms significantly influence the success of monitoring operations. Given that developing and deploying botnets for testing at scale is not feasible, this paper introduces a simulation framework for P2.P botnets to address these challenges.

The proposed Botnet Simulation Framework (BSF) offers several key capabilities:
- **Scalability**: It can simulate P2P botnets with over 10,000 bots.
- **Realistic Churn Behaviors**: The framework incorporates realistic network churn behaviors, which are crucial for accurate simulations.
- **Monitoring Mechanisms**: It implements common P2P botnet monitoring techniques, allowing researchers to evaluate their effectiveness.

Additionally, BSF enables the injection of simulated traffic into arbitrary network files (e.g., PCAP files) using the Intrusion Detection Dataset Toolkit (ID2T). This feature enhances the versatility and applicability of the framework, making it a valuable tool for researchers and security professionals.
