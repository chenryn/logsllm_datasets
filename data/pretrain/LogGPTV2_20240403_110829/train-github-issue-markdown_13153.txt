### Apache Airflow version
2.4.2
### What happened
We upgraded airflow from 2.4.1 to 2.4.2 and immediately notice that every task
log line is duplicated _into_ CloudWatch. Comparing logs from tasks run before
upgrade and after upgrade indicates that the issue is not in how the logs are
displayed in Airflow, but rather that it now produces two log lines instead of
one.
When observing both the CloudWatch log streams and the Airflow UI, we can see
duplicate log lines for ~~_all_~~ most log entries post upgrade, whilst seeing
single log lines in tasks before upgrade.
This happens _both_ for tasks ran in a remote `EcsRunTaskOperator`'s as well
as in regular `PythonOperator`'s.
### What you think should happen instead
A single non-duplicate log line should be produced into CloudWatch.
### How to reproduce
From my understanding now, any setup on 2.4.2 that uses CloudWatch remote
logging will produce duplicate log lines. (But I have not been able to confirm
other setups)
### Operating System
Docker: `apache/airflow:2.4.2-python3.9` \- Running on AWS ECS Fargate
### Versions of Apache Airflow Providers
    apache-airflow[celery,postgres,apache.hive,jdbc,mysql,ssh,amazon,google,google_auth]==2.4.2
    apache-airflow-providers-amazon==6.0.0
### Deployment
Other Docker-based deployment
### Deployment details
We are running a docker inside Fargate ECS on AWS.
The following environment variables + config in CloudFormation control remote
logging:
                - Name: AIRFLOW__LOGGING__REMOTE_LOGGING
                  Value: True
                - Name: AIRFLOW__LOGGING__REMOTE_BASE_LOG_FOLDER
                  Value: !Sub "cloudwatch://${TasksLogGroup.Arn}"
### Anything else
We did not change any other configuration during the upgrade, simply bumped
the requirements for provider list + docker image from 2.4.1 to 2.4.2.
