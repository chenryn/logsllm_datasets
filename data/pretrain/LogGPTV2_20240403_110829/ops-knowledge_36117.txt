User: 请选择LogParser领域相关问题的正确答案及解释如下是一些常见的日志
 0 20:10:48 INFO Reading broadcast variable 4 took 18 ms
 1 20:10:54 INFO Reading broadcast variable 18 took 12 ms
 2 20:10:52 INFO Reading broadcast variable 11 took 15 ms
 3 20:10:54 INFO Reading broadcast variable 17 took 12 ms
 4 20:11:10 INFO Reading broadcast variable 39 took 716 ms
 5 20:10:53 INFO Reading broadcast variable 13 took 41 ms
日志最前面三部分别为序号、时间戳和日志Level，在不考虑这三部分内容的情况下，此处我们设定日志的变量用'<*>'代替，token与token之间用空格分隔，那么请问上述日志的日志模版具体是什么？

A: Changing modify acls to: <*>
B: Changing view acls to: <*>
C: Reading broadcast variable <*> took <*> ms
D: Registered signal handlers for [TERM, HUP, INT]

Assistant: Answer: C
