**Describe the current behavior**
Hi, when I am using the hessian_vector_product() to computer the
hessian_vector_product of my model, it returns results organized as
IndexedSliceValue. This is OK because the model include data structure like
embeddings.
However, when I do the assert on the indices of the returned
IndexedSliceValue. I notice that there are duplicated indices with different
corresponding values. May I know how to deal with these conflict ? Thanks in advance.
