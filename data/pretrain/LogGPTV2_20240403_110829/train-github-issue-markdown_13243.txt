Just a suggestion: do not ignore the src and examples folders when installing
three.js from npm and/or bower.
This would not break compatibility with existing projects that use npm or
bower to install three.js, but provide a valid use case: it would allow to
integrate a custom build process for three.js into our existing build
pipelines for our apps.
The current way for custom builds as outlined in
https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/build.py,-or-how-to-generate-a-
compressed-Three.js-file is focused on a manual process: clone the repo, run
the build, and add the finished custom JS file to your app's git repo. However
that cannot be automated conveniently within the context of existing build
processes for our own apps. Upon updates of three.js you have to repeat these
steps every time.
On the other hand if the src and examples files would not be excluded, one
could use the package managing power of npm or bower to include your three.js
dependency in your project (with the ability to target specific versions,
version ranges, the dev branch...), and have your build workflow of choice
(gulp, grunt, whatever) automate the custom build process, as it would be able
to pick the individual src files from the installed package
(node_modules/bower_components) now. This would allow for effortless updates,
integration in CI server workflows etc.
I can file a PR (easy enough ;)), just wanted to know if there might be
objections?
