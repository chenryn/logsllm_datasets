Markham, recognized as a high-tech capital in Canada, also boasts one of the best-preserved historic zones in its Unionville district. The city employs nearly 1,000 full-time staff and is supported by an additional 800 to 1,500 part-time, seasonal, and temporary employees. Its focus on leadership and innovation has attracted numerous businesses, including IBM, American Express, and Toshiba.

The collaboration with the Institute without Boundaries (IwB) occurred at a pivotal moment when Markham was redefining itself. In 2011, it was still classified as a township and a rapidly growing suburb of Toronto. However, in 2012, it was officially designated as a city. As Markham transitioned from a town to a city, the municipal government aimed to address business closures and a declining population, particularly among the youth moving to Toronto's city center. Markham realized the need to be proactive in fostering economic and cultural growth to attract and retain residents, especially the younger generation, while continuing to make the city attractive for businesses.

Between 2011 and 2012, municipal management, staff, community members, and local business representatives worked closely with IwB students, who acted as advisors during charrettes, reviewed proposals, attended presentations, and provided ongoing feedback. This collaborative process ensured that a wide range of perspectives and insights from the Markham community were incorporated. The city generously sponsored the project, contributing cash, staff time, organizing community gatherings, and providing an incubator space at the Markham Convergence Center and an exhibition space at the Varley Art Gallery for the year-end student exhibit.

Asma Khanani Caporaletti, an IwB alumna involved in the COLAB project, noted that city managers and staff were extremely open and generous with their time and resources. They had a clear understanding of their demographic composition and cultural identity, particularly regarding the needs of their large Asian immigrant population. For Khanani Caporaletti, the city's self-awareness, recognition of inevitable growth, openness to new ideas, and forward-thinking leadership were key to the success of the collaboration.

Through design thinking and systems analysis, the IwB students generated ideas for infrastructural and service design improvements across the city. They explored alternative uses for parking lots and green fields, created tools to empower small businesses, identified and celebrated community landmarks, and defined creative industry hubs. The focus was on main streets like Old Kennedy Road and Highway 7, which are more car-friendly than pedestrian-friendly, with limited public and green spaces. The students proposed a 'complete streets' approach to restructure these main thoroughfares, enhancing accessibility, residential and commercial infill, and public infrastructure.

Ultimately, the students' work culminated in a proposal for a pilot project called COLAB, an interdisciplinary design solutions unit for Markham. COLAB aims to create a neutral space where political, social, design, business, and technical forces of innovation can converge and be leveraged. It utilizes the resources of the municipality, the dynamism of the private sector, and the wisdom of the community to research, design, develop, and prototype innovative solutions to 21st-century urban challenges. The goal was to establish a change lab in Markham, both onsite and online, that would be project-based and ongoing, serving as a virtual and physical space to explore the city's innovation ecosystem.

According to Khanani Caporaletti, Markham had the resources but needed guidance on how to direct the city's potential growth. The city needed to address gaps in infrastructure and cultural planning through softer, creative processes. The IwB brought tangible, creative ideas that resonated with citizens and city employees. Khanani Caporaletti emphasized that COLAB, as a pilot project, would enable the implementation of these ideas and introduce an interdisciplinary perspective to break the routine of everyday bureaucracy. She noted that good solutions take time to implement and become part of everyday life.

Markham benefited from the commitment, enthusiasm, and immersion of the IwB students, who focused on the city for nine months, as well as the support and expertise of IwB mentors. The IwB pairs students with mid-career professionals and expert mentors from various fields, ensuring that contemporary knowledge and deep industry insights are combined. This partnership created a community of knowledge where ideas could be explored from multiple perspectives.

Stephen Chait, Director of Economic Development at the City of Markham, highlighted that the IwB partnership provided unique and valuable opportunities for alternative service delivery solutions inspired by diverse precedents and cutting-edge thinking. He believes that working with interdisciplinary design entities like the IwB offers financial benefits, as the city can pool a talented and interdisciplinary team instead of hiring a consulting firm or using city resources. Chait also noted that the students' involvement and enthusiasm were unparalleled, making it a "financial imperative" for municipalities to consider such partnerships in light of shrinking budgets and growing challenges.

Unlike traditional consulting firms, the IwB students' objective was not to diagnose problems but to identify strategic opportunities and leverage existing public and private assets for maximum impact. Through public charrettes, exhibitions, and internal critiques, proposals were refined and presented for internal and public scrutiny. The most significant outcome was the framework used to achieve design innovation, emphasizing interdisciplinarity and collaboration between the community, industry, and government. The COLAB model envisions a unifying space where different stakeholders, including the municipality, private sector, and citizens, can collaborate, contributing both funds and human capital.

In 2013, the IwB began a partnership with Dublin City Council (DCC), the municipal authority for the City of Dublin. DCC employs 6,000 staff and provides over 500 services, including planning, housing, roads, water, wastewater, culture, recreational, and emergency services. Dublin, one of Europe's oldest cities, is considered a 'global city' despite its relatively small size. It led Ireland's expansion during the Celtic Tiger economic boom but also faced significant challenges during the 2009 economic crisis, including derelict properties, rising crime rates, and budget cuts.

In 2010, DCC established The Studio, a multidisciplinary unit within the city government, following a project series called Designing Dublin. This initiative, a collaboration between the firm Design Twentyfirst Century (D21C) and several creative professionals, including an IwB alumnus, aimed to improve Dublin's city center in the wake of the economic crisis. The project highlighted the potential of a city innovation incubator, leading to the creation of The Studio. Comprising an interdisciplinary team, The Studio was envisioned as a space to cultivate new ideas to address the city's socio-economic problems and rebuild public trust in the municipal authority.

The relationship between the IwB and The Studio developed over four to five years, involving various projects, including Designing Dublin. In 2010, The Studio approached the IwB to discuss a full partnership, motivated by an interest in connecting with other interdisciplinary design studios and the IwB's high standards and scope of past projects. Deirdre Ni Raghallaigh, The Studio's Senior Executive Officer, emphasized that the partnership offered an opportunity to grow DCC's international network and encouraged looking beyond local boundaries. It also inspired the idea of setting up a similar academic program in Dublin to teach design methodology locally.

The Dublin Project collaboration included minor partners like D21C and a major academic partner, the Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT). Dublin staff and students were embedded in the IwB's 2013-2014 curriculum, participating as mentors and contributors. In October and November 2012, IwB students and staff spent five weeks conducting primary research and working with DCC and The Studio staff in Dublin, culminating in a charrette at DIT. Throughout 2012-2013, the IwB students presented case studies suggesting cultural projects, urban regeneration initiatives, and transparency measures. DCC ultimately chose to focus on improving communication and trust between the city and the public.

The IwB students proposed Our Dublin, a system of programs to support and activate civic engagement and collaboration. Our Dublin aims to innovate and create intelligence around public engagement and improve trust between citizens and the municipal government. The project focuses on better connections with citizens and data collection through sensor software, data mission applications, and an accessible digital dashboard. Users can analyze, understand, and react to the data through interactive tools. Additionally, the program includes a Project-Maker Starter Kit, a resource kit to foster public imagination and problem-solving around city challenges, helping citizens start and collaborate on community-building projects.

While Our Dublin emphasizes new technologies like sensors and digital applications, it also includes on-the-ground components, such as the DubBus, a rotating bus with regular stop points in Dublin City where citizens can gather and share ideas with local staff. The program's focus on circulating, storing, and implementing ideas is central to The Studio's agenda and the IwB's proposal for Our Dublin.

Currently, Our Dublin is being proposed to the DCC City Manager's bureau. Whether fully implemented or partially adopted, the project's circulation and the opening of minds to facilitate change in service provision are crucial. Ni Raghallaigh notes that the implementation of an idea depends on its ambition and scope, but the broader impact lies in the new perspectives and possibilities it introduces.
