as a high tech capital in Canada, but it also has one 
of the best maintained historic zones in its Unionville 
district. The City of Markham employs close to 1,000 
regular full time staff, and is supported by 800 to 1,500 
part time, seasonal, and temporary staff. Its emphasis on 
leadership and innovation has drawn many businesses 
to Markham, like IBM, AMEX, and Toshiba. 
The IwB partnership took place at a crucial time 
during which Markham was redefining itself. In 
2011, The City of Markham was still a township, and 
a rapidly expanding suburb of Toronto, but in 2012 
it was officially recognized as a city. As Markham 
changed designation from town to city, the municipal 
government wanted to address business closures 
and a shrinking population due to youth moving to 
Toronto’s city centre. Markham realized it needed to be 
proactive to fuel economic and cultural growth that 
would attract people to their city and prevent young 
people in particular from moving away, simultaneously, 
continuing to make itself attractive for business. 
Between 2011-2012, municipal management, staff, 
108
members of the community, and local business 
representatives, worked with IwB students acting 
as advisors during charrettes, reviewing proposals, 
attending presentations, and providing ongoing 
feedback and support; the ‘client’s’ voice included 
a wide spectrum of observations and comments 
from the wider Markham community. The City was a 
generous sponsor that contributed cash, staff time, 
organized community gatherings and advising groups 
to aid the students’ research, provided an incubator 
space in the Markham Convergence Center, and an 
exhibition space at the Varley Art Gallery in Markham 
for the year-end student exhibit. Asma Khanani 
Caporaletti, an IwB alumna who worked on the COLAB 
project, claims city managers and staff were extremely 
open and generous with their time and resources, and 
understood well their own demographic composition 
and cultural identity. They took a realistic approach to 
“Ultimately, the students’ 
work culminated in a proposal 
for a pilot project called 
COLAB - an interdisciplinary 
design solutions unit for 
Markham that creates a 
space where the political, 
social, design, business, and 
technical forces of innovation 
can meet and be leveraged in 
a neutral space.”
their large Asian immigrant population and its needs, 
in terms of new immigrant resources, employment, 
cultural programming, etc. For Khanani Caporaletti, it 
was the city’s self-knowledge, understanding that their 
growth is inevitable, their openness to new ideas, and 
their forward thinking and encouraging leadership that 
made the collaboration a success.5
Through design thinking and systems analysis, the 
IwB students generated ideas for infrastructural and 
service design improvements citywide. They considered

alternative uses for parking lots and green fields; 
created tools to empower small business; identified 
and celebrated community landmarks; and defined 
creative industry hubs. The focus became Markham’s 
main streets like Old Kennedy Road and Highway 
7, roads that are more accommodating to car than 
pedestrian traffic, with low-density of public and green 
areas. The students took a ‘complete streets approach’6 
and made project proposals to restructure Markham’s 
main streets by enhancing accessibility, residential and 
commercial infill, and public infrastructure. 
Ultimately, the students’ work culminated in a proposal 
for a pilot project called COLAB - an interdisciplinary 
design solutions unit for Markham that creates a 
space where the political, social, design, business, 
and technical forces of innovation can meet and be 
leveraged in a neutral space. COLAB uses the resources 
of the municipality, the dynamism of the private sector 
and the wisdom of the community to research, design, 
develop and prototype innovative solutions to twenty-
first century urban challenges. Ultimately, the student’s 
work became about demonstrating the usefulness 
and suitability of a change lab in Markham that would 
be onsite and online, project based, and ongoing - a 
virtual and physical space where Markham’s ecology of 
innovation could be explored. 
According to Khanani Caporaletti, Markham had the 
resources but needed help on how to direct the city’s 
potential growth. The City needed to direct the ‘softer’ 
and creative processes that could address the gaps 
in infrastructure and cultural planning in Markham. 
The IwB was able to bring in many tangible, creative 
ideas that resonated with citizens and city employees. 
Khanani Caporaletti explains that COLAB as a pilot 
project for the city would enable implementation 
of these ideas and introduce an interdisciplinary 
perspective that could break the formula of everyday 
bureaucracy; it presents a way to invigorate 
government, give it a creative outpost in which city 
officials and interdisciplinary design staff could meet 
and think through city problems together. She notes: 
“For me it was a realization that good solutions take 
time to implement, time to settle and become part of 
everyday life.”7 COLAB is a pilot project for Markham that 
gives a space for ideas to develop locally over time.

Markham gained the commitment, enthusiasm, and 
immersion of the IwB students whose sole focus 
was the City of Markham for nine months, but also 
the support and expertise of the IwB mentors. The 
IwB works by teaming its students with mid-career 
professionals and expert mentors from fields such as 
architecture, urban planning, digital media and design, 
marketing, fine arts, finance, public policy, geography, etc. 
The student’s enthusiasm and energy is matched with 
contemporary knowledge from professionals working on 
current projects, as well as experts further in their career 
that can provide a deep knowledge of their industries. 
Thus, Markham gained not only the commitment of IwB 
students, but its network of professionals and experts. 
Together the IwB and Markham’s different stakeholders 
created a community of knowledge where ideas could 
be explored from multiple perspectives. 
For Stephen Chait, Director of Economic Development 
at the City of Markham, the IwB partnership “provided 
a unique and valuable opportunity for alternate 
service delivery solutions that were inspired by a 
wide diversity of precedents and innovative, cutting 
edge thinking.”8 Chait believes that in addition to the 
conceptual and creative value, there are financial 
benefits to working with interdisciplinary design 
entities like the IwB. Instead of hiring a consulting firm 
or using city resources and employees, the city is able 
to pool a talented and interdisciplinary team. Further, 
according to Chait, the experience was unique because 
for the students the project was the central focus 
and not one of many company projects on the table: 
“there is an involvement and enthusiasm that would 
be difficult to find elsewhere.”9 Ultimately, Chait claims 
it is a “financial imperative” for municipalities to look 
at alternate solutions in view of shrinking city budgets 
and growing city challenges. 
Unlike a consulting firm that uses proven formulas, 
IwB students’ objective was “not to diagnose problems, 
but to identify strategic opportunities and leverage 
existing public and private assets to effect the greatest 
impact.”10 Through the design process that includes 
public charrettes, exhibitions, and internal critiques, 
proposals were presented, refined and represented for 
internal and public scrutiny. More important than one

particular strategy or proposal was the framework the 
students used to achieve design innovation that included 
an emphasis on interdisciplinarity and collaboration 
between community, industry, and government.  Figure 
2, the COLAB Organizational Model, situates the future 
change lab as a unifying space for Markham’s different 
stakeholders, the municipality, private sector, and citizens. 
The innovation made in the COLAB model is that these 
players would collaborate contributing both funds and 
human capital. Here, COLAB is featured at the intersection 
of these different stakeholders. Indeed, in the COLAB 
proposal book the IwB students maintain that:
Our most consistent and high quality results 
were achieved when we worked at the 
intersection of the municipality, community 
and private sector, harnessing the knowledge 
and resources of each to develop strategies 
that went above and beyond. Innovation in 
this context is about enabling dialogue and 
collaboration between diverse partners, and 
providing a laboratory for new ideas and best 
practices to be shared and celebrated.11
The students’ work became about creating an 
environment where ideas about enhancing and 
restructuring Markham could continue to take place. The 
project work mapped out the systems and challenges 
in Markham, and proposed new tools and strategies for 
addressing these issues. But the COLAB project proposes 
more than new urban regeneration strategies, it shows 
an understanding that innovation is an ecology that 
needs to address problems by leveraging community, 
industry, and government and providing a neutral 
space for these entities to brainstorm, finance, and test 
solutions together. These networks provided the base 
understanding for the challenges facing Markham, 
and when synergized they created the best solutions 
to Markham’s challenges because they stemmed from 
ideas generated in tandem with Markham community, 
government, and industry stakeholders. 
The Studio, Dublin City Council, and Service Design 
Innovation 
Beginning in 2013, the IwB began a partnership with 
Dublin City Council (DCC), the municipal authority 
for the City of Dublin. DCC employs 6,000 staff and 
provides over 500 services to Dublin City and the

wider Dublin region. These services include, planning, 
housing, roads, water, wastewater, culture, recreational 
and emergency services. Dublin is one of the oldest 
cities in Europe. It is small in comparison to most world 
capitals, but is considered a ‘global city.’12 It led Ireland’s 
expansion during the Celtic Tiger economic boom, it 
also felt the equal brunt of the economic crisis starting 
in 2009; along with a host of challenges, the recession 
has meant dealing with derelict properties known 
as ‘ghost estates,’ rising crime rates, and a decreased 
budget for the city to deal with these new problems. 
In 2010, DCC created The Studio, a multidisciplinary 
unit within city government. The Studio is a new and

experimental phenomenon in city governance that 
came out of a project series called Designing Dublin, 
a collaboration between the firm Design Twentyfirst 
Century (D21C) and several creative professionals in 
Dublin and Europe, including an IwB alumni.13 The 
Designing Dublin collaborative looked at how Dublin 
City could be improved in the wake of an economic 
crisis that left many derelict properties in the city 
centre. The project looked to find potential in these 
spaces and to generally make the city centre more 
attractive to people. The project materialized the 
potential of a city innovation incubator and gained the 
attention of Dublin City Manager John Tierney, who 
decided to form The Studio to make organizational

brought together as an interdisciplinary team, including 
an architect, planner, human resource specialist, 
financial advisor, information science researcher, etc. 
Tierney envisioned The Studio as both an interior and 
fringe space in city government that would enable 
the City of Dublin to cultivate new ideas to confront 
the city’s socio-economic problems and to counter 
the public’s suspicions of the municipal authority. The 
Studio has worked on Public Realm Projects, improving 
service design in the city, and initiated programs such 
as Dublinked, and the DCC Staff Ideas Scheme.14 
The relationship between the IwB and The Studio 
developed over a four to five year period during which 
the two entities worked together in different capacities 
on several projects, including Designing Dublin. In 
2010, The Studio approached the IwB to discuss a 
full partnership. The Studio’s Senior Executive Officer, 
Deirdre Ni Raghallaigh, describes the motivation for the 
partnership as in part an interest in connecting with 
other interdisciplinary design studios, and a particular 
interest in working with the IwB.15 She emphasizes that 
the partnership offered The Studio an opportunity to 
grow its international network, and encouraged DCC 
and The Studio to look outside itself; it was important 
from her perspective to give DCC and The Studio’s 
staff this experience. Further, the high standard and 
the scope of the IwB’s past projects demonstrated to 
Ni Raghallaigh the usefulness of setting up a similar 
academic program in a Dublin institution, where design 
methodology could be taught locally. Thus, The Dublin 
Project became a partnership that also included minor 
project partners: Design Twentyfirst Century (D21C), an 
Irish not for profit, charitable organization dedicated 
to innovating Irish society, and a major academic 
institution the Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT), and 
their School of Art, Design, and Printing in Dublin. 
The Dublin Project collaboration has created a strong 
and unique partnership. Dublin staff and students 
became embedded in the IwB’s 2013-2014 curriculum 
and have given time and energy as mentors and 
participants in many respects. In October and November 
2012, the IwB students and staff spent five weeks doing 
primary research and working with DCC and The Studio 
staff in Dublin; the visit culminated in a charrette held

for all participants at DIT. Throughout 2012-2013, the 
IwB students presented small case studies to the client 
suggesting cultural projects and agendas to encourage 
public engagement, urban regeneration projects to 
create better public spaces, and a range of propositions 
to create transparency and clearer communication 
between the city and the public. Ultimately DCC, choose 
the latter as the focus of the major project. The IwB 
students proposed Our Dublin, a system of programs 
intended to support and activate civic engagement 
and collaboration. Our Dublin responds to DCC’s aims 
to innovate and create intelligence around the issue of 
public engagement and to improve trust between the 
citizens and the municipal government. 
The project is focused on making better connections 
with citizens and gathering data from citizens about 
the city. Figure 3, shows the Our Dublin Project 
Overview. “Sense it, see it, make it” frames the 
organizational, and digital components of the program. 
Through sensor software, data mission applications, 
and an open and accessible digital dashboard DCC 
is able to collect information about city issues from 
citizens. Users can analyze, understand, and react 
to the data through interactive tools. In addition, 
the program features a Project-Maker Starter Kit, 
an information and digital resource kit that fosters 
public imagination and problem solving around city 
challenges and helps citizens start and collaborate on 
projects to build their community. 
While Our Dublin strives to embed interactive tools 
in city space and in the citizens’ hands, the program’s 
focus on new technologies such as sensors and digital 
applications is balanced by on the ground delivery of 
program components like the DubBus, a rotating bus 
with regular stop points in Dublin City where citizens 
can assemble and share ideas onsite with local staff, and 
participate in community engagement around service 
planning. Indeed, how ideas are circulated, stored, and 
locally implemented are on the forefront of The Studio’s 
agenda and the IwB’s proposal for Our Dublin.
Currently, Our Dublin is being proposed to the DCC City 
Manager’s bureau. Our Dublin may become the new face 
of the DCC, or parts of its vision may be implemented. 
What is most important however, is that proposals like 
Our Dublin are being circulated, and are opening up 
staff and citizens’ minds to facilitate change in service 
provision. Ni Raghallaigh explains that whether an idea 
112
is implemented or not is dependent on the ambition 
and scope of the concept, but not exclusively so, “A
