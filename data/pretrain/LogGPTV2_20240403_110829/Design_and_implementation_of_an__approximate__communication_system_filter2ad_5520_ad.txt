### Priority Queues and Data Processing in 802.11a Pipeline

Our system supports four priority levels, with each level having its own queue. In the provided figure, we illustrate three queues containing data for I, P, and B frames. In a standard 802.11a pipeline, all incoming data is placed into a single queue, and an Ethernet-style frame can have a maximum payload of 1500 bytes. In our system, the total data per wireless frame remains at 1500 bytes, but this data is distributed among the I, P, and B queues. Each fragment from these queues is independently processed through the scrambler and convolutional encoder, similar to a regular 802.11 pipeline, and then arrives at the interleaver.

At the interleaver, the scrambled and convolutionally encoded data are still separated by their priority levels and placed in separate queues. The bits are then positioned based on a greedy algorithm. Each bit-sequence generated corresponds to a symbol and typically includes bits from the different queues. Similar to a standard 802.11 interleaver, we allow the interleaving of bit values across multiple OFDM sub-carriers if they are used. However, unlike a standard interleaver, we restrict the interleaving of bits within a single sub-carrier to those allocated to the same priority class.

Finally, based on the application data value and the Bit Error Rate (BER) feedback from the receiver, one of the data constellation maps is selected. The bit-sequences are mapped to the corresponding symbol values using a simple table lookup process, as in a regular pipeline, and then handed over to the RF front-end. A similar, but reverse, process occurs in the receive chain.

### Evaluation of Performance Benefits

We now evaluate the performance benefits offered by Apex in detail. Additionally, we demonstrate that the advantages of approximate communication complement other mechanisms for adding unequal error protection, such as application-layer Forward Error Correction (FEC) and data re-transmissions.

#### Experiment Configurations

We describe the new aspects of our experimental configuration for evaluating the performance of video streaming in Apex. We use the same WARP Software-Defined Radio (SDR) platform, with signal processing functions implemented in laptops connected to these radios.

**Video Content:**
- **Claire and Foreman Video Clips:** Encoded to MPEG-4 format using the `ffmpeg` tool.
- **Encoding Rate:** 384 kbps
- **Frame Rate:** 30 frames per second
- **GOP Size:** 30 frames
- **Buffering:** 1 second to collect all frames in a GOP
- **Playback Length:** 500 seconds (looped multiple times)
- **Repetitions:** 20 times unless otherwise stated
- **Streaming Tool:** Evalvid, modified to provide information about frame type and priority during streaming.

**Metrics:**
- **Quality Comparison:** Visual and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)
- **PSNR Correlation:** Well-correlated with perceived video quality
- **Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and PSNR Range:** Summarized in Table 3

**Schemes Compared:**
- **Approximate Communication (Apex):** Aware of relative protection levels of different bit positions.
- **Traditional Communication (Trad.):** Unaware of relative protection levels.
- **Partial Recovery:** Allowed for bits not in error [18].

We compare the re-transmission volumes needed for Apex and traditional systems to achieve similar PSNR. We also measure the additive gains of Apex in the presence of application-layer FEC.

**Complementary Mechanisms:**
- **MAC-Layer Mechanisms (ZipTx and MRD)**
- **PHY-MAC Mechanisms (PPR and SOFT)**

Implementing all these schemes within the WARP SDR platform was challenging. In Section 5, we provide an intuitive explanation of why other schemes (PPR, SOFT, MRD, and ZipTx) are expected to provide complementary gains to Apex.

**Trace-Based Evaluation for Dynamic Rate Adaptation:**
- **High Latency Issue:** High latency in processing RF samples and sending feedback.
- **Solution:** Trace-driven analysis, commonly used in rate adaptation algorithms with PHY layer processing needs [34].
- **Process:** Iteratively send small packets (200 bytes) at different rates, ensuring monotonically increasing BER with increasing data rate for coherent channel conditions.

#### Experimental Results

**Apex vs. Traditional — Representative Scenario:**
- **Performance Comparison:** Figure 12 shows the PSNR differences between traditional and approximate communication with dynamic rate and constellation map adaptation.
- **Average Uncoded BER:** 4.1 × 10^(-3), corresponding to a coded BER of O(10^(-5)).
- **PSNR Improvement:** About 16 dB across 20 runs.
- **Performance Gain:** Due to importance-aware mapping of data bits to bit positions within symbols.

**Impact of Constellation Map Selection:**
- **Factors:** Channel conditions (pj values) and differential value of application bits (vi values).
- **Dependence on Application Data:** Table 4 shows the relative performance for Claire and Foreman videos with statically chosen constellation maps.
- **Dynamic Adaptation:** Figure 13 illustrates dynamic switching of data encoding schemes based on utility (Block and Gray).

**With External Interference:**
- **Interference Levels:** Varying external interference generated by a third node.
- **Performance Gains:** Figure 14 shows PSNR for traditional and approximate communication under varying external interference.
- **Relative Gains:** Higher gains for Apex due to informed placement of application bits.

**Complementarity to Application-Level FEC:**
- **Evaluation:** Comparison of traditional and approximate communication with and without application-level FEC (Reed-Solomon RS(255,233) code).
- **Results:** Apex outperforms traditional communication in both scenarios, as shown in Figure 15.

**Comparison with MAC Layer Scheme:**
- **Variant:** MAC-layer variant where I-frames are sent at a lower rate, and P- and B-frames at a higher rate.
- **Performance:** Apex outperformed the MAC layer variant by at least 4 dB or more.
- **Re-transmissions:** Number of symbols required by the MAC layer scheme is 1.85× that of Apex to achieve the same PSNR performance.

**Error in Estimating BER:**
- **Table 5:** Error of BER estimation for different bit positions in 64-QAM, Block coding, with varying numbers of pilot symbols.

This comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the significant performance benefits and complementary nature of Apex in various communication scenarios.
