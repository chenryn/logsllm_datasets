**What happened** :
  1. Node has a pod with AWS EBS attached
  2. Docker restarts, kubelet restarts
  3. Pod goes to `Error` status, with messages
     1m            1m              1       {kubelet ip-10-50-195-252.eu-west-1.compute.internal}                   Warning         FailedMount     Unable to moun

    try-341515849-b1f4k"/"default". list of unattached/unmounted volumes=[storage]
      1m            1m              1       {kubelet ip-10-50-195-252.eu-west-1.compute.internal}                   Warning         FailedSync      Error syncing
    pod, skipping: timeout expired waiting for volumes to attach/mount for pod "registry-341515849-b1f4k"/"default". list of unattached/unmounted volumes=[storage
    ]
  4. EBS volume is correctly attached and mounted to the node, `volumesAttached` and `volumesInUse` is correct on the node. Controller manager detects no problems, and doesn't do anything.
  5. Pod never recovers. Manual unmount/detach/pod delete is required to recover.
**What you expected to happen** :  
After a kubelet restart, pod should be healthy and pod sync succeeds.
**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):
  1. Create a pod with attached EBS
  2. Restart kubelet
**Anything else do we need to know** :
I think this is a regression from #33616, since it worked for me in 1.3. But
not sure, need to dig further.
