### Impact of Blacklist Knowledge on Attackers

As described in Section III-A, we assume the attacker is aware of the blacklisting strategy employed by the system and can optimize their guessing strategy by avoiding items on the blacklist. In this section, we evaluate the benefit this optimization provides. Table VII presents the net gains and losses for guessing PINs when the attacker has knowledge of the blacklist.

#### Placebo and Click-Through Treatments
For the placebo (Pla-4 and Pla-6) and click-through treatments (iOS-4-wC and iOS-6-wC), knowledge of the blacklist is unhelpful. The blacklist effectively contains only one item for the placebo, as the first choice of a participant is dynamically blacklisted. Knowing that a PIN was blocked offers little advantage to the attacker, resulting in no clear gain or harm. Therefore, we model a blacklist-knowledgeable attacker for the placebo treatments (see Table VI).

In the case of a non-enforcing blacklist where users can click through the warning message, the situation is more nuanced. If the attacker explicitly avoids PINs on the blacklist, even though these PINs may still be selected due to non-enforcement, the guessing strategy is harmed (as shown by negative values in Table VII). None of the tested modifications, such as incorporating the observed click-through rate, improve the guessing strategy. Consequently, we consider an attacker who does not use the blacklist to change their guessing strategy for the click-through treatments (iOS-4-wC and iOS-6-wC).

For the remaining treatments (iOS-4-nC, DD-4-27, DD-4-2740), there are clear advantages when the attacker knows the blacklist.

### Blacklisting Impact on Security

We now examine how different blacklists perform in terms of improving security. The primary results are summarized in Table VI, which reports the guessing performance against each treatment. As described in Section III-A, rate limits are implemented on Android and iOS, so we report on throttled attacks with 10, 30, and 100 guesses.

#### Smaller Blacklists
In the throttled setting with 100 guesses, there is little difference among iOS-4-digit-wCt (15%), iOS-4-digit-nCt (11%), DD-4-digit-27 (15%), and Placebo-4-digit (16%) compared to Control-4-digit (17%). Post-hoc analyses (Bonferroni-corrected for multiple testing) support this, finding no significant difference between the smaller blacklists. This makes it difficult to justify the combination of throttling and small blacklists, especially given the negative sentiments associated with blacklist warnings (see Section VI-F).

In the unthrottled setting, however, differences emerge. The smallest blacklist (DD-4-digit-27) outperforms the 10× larger iOS blacklist (iOS-4-digit-nCt). We conjecture this is due to iOS' inclusion of PINs based on repetitions, which were chosen less often by our participants. Thus, in an unthrottled setting, blacklisting can offer real benefits. The median guess numbers for both 4- and 6-digit placebos suggest that simply pushing users away from their first choice can improve security. However, direct use of a placebo blacklist is unlikely to be effective and problematic in practice, as users will quickly figure out the deception.

#### Large Blacklist
We also consider a very large blacklist in the DD-4-digit-2740 treatment, containing 2740 PINs and blocking 27.4% of the key space. At this scale, noticeable effects on security are observed in the throttled setting. Even after 100 guesses, the attacker finds only 1% of 4-digit PINs. Our χ2 tests support this, showing a significant difference (p < 0.01). Post-hoc analyses (Bonferroni-corrected) found a significant difference between the large DD-4-2740 blacklist and Con-6 (p < 0.01) as well as all other 4-digit treatments: Con-4 (p < 0.001), Pla-4 (p < 0.01), iOS-4-wC (p < 0.01), iOS-4-nC (p < 0.05), and DD-4-27 (p < 0.01). This suggests that a larger blacklist can improve security in a throttled setting.

While similar positive security results are present in the unthrottled setting, Section VI-E shows that a larger blacklist leads to perceived lower usability. Balancing user experience with security gains is crucial.

#### Correctly Sizing a Blacklist
While a large blacklist offers clear benefits, it is important to find the right size to counteract negative usability and user experience issues. We simulate user responses to shorter blacklists using data from the DD-4-digit-2740 treatment. The results, shown in Figure 7, reveal several troughs and peaks in the curves, which we speculate relate to changes in user choices as they move from their first-choice PIN to subsequent choices due to expanding blacklist restrictions.

Based on these cycles, we conclude that an appropriately-sized blacklist should be based on one of the troughs where the attacker is most disadvantaged. For throttled attackers limited to 100 guesses, a blacklist of ∼10% of the key space (∼1150 PINs) appears ideal. This minimizes user discomfort and frustration, as seen in the first trough at about 10% of the 4-digit PIN space.

### Enforcing the Blacklist

In the 4-digit case, we compared enforcing (iOS-4-digit-nCt) and non-enforcing (iOS-4-digit-wCt) blacklists and found that enabling a click-through option does not significantly affect security. This suggests that using a click-through option does not reduce security in the throttled attacker setting, despite the fact that clicked-through PINs are extremely weak (see row Clicked-through-4 in Table VI).

We also investigated why participants chose to ignore and click through the warning messages. From the 28 participants who saw a blacklist warning in the iOS-4-wC treatment, we observed a click-through-rate (CTR) of 68% (19 participants). In the 6-digit treatment iOS-6-wC, 10 out of 15 (67%) ignored the warning, which is twice the rate at which TLS warnings are ignored (∼30%).

The three most common reasons for clicking through were:
1. **Memorability Issues**: "Because this is the number I can remember."
2. **Incomplete Threat Models**: "Many people don’t tend to try the obvious PIN as they think it’s too obvious, so people won’t use it."
3. **Indifference**: "I don’t give [sic] about the warning. Security is overrated."

These findings align with prior work where users do not follow external guidance for various reasons.

### PIN Changing Strategies

In our study, we asked 367 participants who faced a blacklist how their creation strategy changed in response to the warning. We sampled 126 responses (10% of total participants) and grouped them into three categories: participants who continued using the "Same" strategy, those who made "Minor" changes, and those who came up with a completely "New" strategy. Examples can be found in Appendix E, Table XIII. Inter-rater reliability between coders measured by Cohen’s kappa was κ = 0.96.

About 50% of participants chose a new strategy when confronted with a blacklist warning. Only participants in the DD-4-27 treatment with a very small blacklist tended to keep their pre-warning strategy. Edit distances varied slightly across treatments, supporting self-reported behavior: participants in the 4-digit scenario changed, on average, 3 digits, while some changed their PIN completely and others only changed 2 digits. Similar conclusions can be drawn from the edit distances in the 6-digit case.

### User Perception

We analyzed participants’ perceptions regarding PIN selections in terms of security and usability. Participants were asked to complete the phrase “I feel the PIN I chose is” with three adjectives: "secure, memorable, and convenient."
