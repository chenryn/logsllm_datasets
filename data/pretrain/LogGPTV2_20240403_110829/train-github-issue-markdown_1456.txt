I'm creating API on server.js that uses user authentication via passport.
I already add code to use passport and it works fine. If the user is not
authorized, then redirect to login page for page, or return 403 Forbedden for
APIs.
    const isAuthenticatedAPI = (req, res, next) => {
        if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
            return next();
        } else {
            res.sendStatus(403);
        }
    };
    server.get("/api/item/:id", isAuthenticatedAPI, (req, res) => {
        // API implementation
    });
But it is too strong. The code reject API calls during SSR. I hope to omit
authentication check during SSR. I thought two solutions, but they were
fragile:
  * Checking user-agent is `node-fetch/1.0 (+https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch)` or not.
  * Checking req.ip is local or not (via is-local-ip)
Is there any cool solution to identify the API client is for SSR or CSR?
thanks,
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
We will get any good solution to decide authentication check should be omitted
or not.
## Current Behavior
I couldn't identify API call is for SSR/CSR in Express.js's handler.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Add passport to next's server.js
  2. Call the API during SSR (it's ok on CSR)
  3.   4. 
## Context
I am creating the website that has uses user authentication via passport.
