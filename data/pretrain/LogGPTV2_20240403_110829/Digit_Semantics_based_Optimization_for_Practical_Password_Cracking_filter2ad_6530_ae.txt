of JtR, the efficiency improvement on Chinese passwords is more
significant.
Another important feature shown in Figure 6 is that we can
already obtain a promising result when adding the top 100 digit
semantics rules. We further compare the top 100 digit semantics
rules (referred to as Digits_100) and the full set of Digits with 10,000,
100,000, and 500,000 random rules generated by Hashcat (referred
to as HR_10000, HR_100000, and HR_500000, respectively). Note
that since one digit semantics rule can generate multiple guesses
when processing one word, Digits_100 usually generates more
guesses compared to the rule set with 100 built-in rules. We present
more detailed information about the Digits_100 in Appendix D.
Table 6 shows the number of extra guesses and the relative in-
crease after adding each additional rule set. In general, our digit
semantics rules can crack much more new passwords with fewer
guesses. In the experiment of Chinese passwords, we can see a
significant advantage of digit semantics rules. The relative increase
of Digits_100 is much higher than that of HR_10000, which gener-
ates a similar amount of guesses with Digits_100, especially under
T0XlC (2.01×) and the large rule set Generated2 (28.79×). Even
when compared to HR_100000, which generates guesses of one
more order of magnitude, the increase of Digit_100 is still evidently
higher. As for the full set of Digits, the results is promising, too.
The increase of Digits exceeds that of HR_100000, even that of
HR_500000 under Generated2. By contrast, the advantage of digit
semantics on English passwords is less significant but still evident.
Digits_100 brings a much higher increase compared to HR_10000,
which generates a similar amount of guesses. It even exceeds the
performance of HR_100000, which generates guesses of one more
order of magnitude under Generated2. It is similar in the case of
the full set of Digits.
7 DISCUSSION
In this section, we discuss our matching method used in our extrac-
tion tool, some guidelines on the password security based on our
work, and further work.
Matching Method. The matching method used in Section 3.2.1 is
essentially an expansion of the type-based tagging method proposed
in [46], which is highly adaptive for new type-based tags. In our
work, we focus on digit semantics and propose 12 tags of digit
semantics. Based on the type-based method and our 12 tags, we
propose an automatic, highly configurable extraction tool to extract
digit semantics. Besides, we arrange the matching order to reduce
false positives for those tags of Information Represented with Digits
in Step A and use S1 as a dictionary to extract Combination of Single
Tags. Moreover, we add Step C to segment the unmatched segments
to obtain a finer-grained dictionary.
Password Policies and Guidelines. Our analysis also reveals
the vulnerabilities of selecting digit semantics. The results in Sec-
tion 4.2.1 show the significant role of Date in passwords. This fea-
ture can be exploited by attackers and has an impact on password
security, which is also shown in the analysis of digit semantics rules
with high performance in Section 6.2.3 and Appendix D. Therefore,
we suggest that users use password managers to create random
passwords to avoid those vulnerable digit semantics including Date.
Besides, when using digit semantics segments, users prefer to
place them at the end, at the front, or as a whole password, as
is shown in Section 4.2.2. Such behaviors would have a serious
impact on the password security. Take a pure dictionary for ex-
ample, attackers can utilize these position features to filter out
most guesses, and use a minor subset of guesses to match most
passwords with digit semantics. This threat can also be avoided
by using password managers. However, for users prefer to create
passwords on their own [33] and use digit semantics, we highly
recommend that users should put those digit semantics segments
in passwords with offsets.
Further Work. In future, we will apply more types of semantics
which are represented with letters, like the names, cities, into the
rule-based attack in practical password cracking tools.
8 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we optimize practical password cracking tools by
utilizing the rich digit semantics in passwords. We first propose
an automatic and configurable digit semantics extraction tool and
further conduct a comprehensive analysis on the digit semantics
in real-world passwords. Furthermore, we optimize practical pass-
word cracking tools to crack passwords more efficiently on the level
of digit semantics. The evaluation results show that our work sig-
nificantly improves the guessing efficiency. For example, compared
523ACSAC ’21, December 6–10, 2021, Virtual Event, USA
H. Zhang, C. Wang, W. Ruan, et al.
with the extended rule set used in the work of Liu et al. [29], with
our digit semantics rules applied, JtR can obtain increases of up to
17.58% (under 1011 guesses) and 28.47% (under 107 guesses) when
cracking Chinese and English passwords with digit segments. In
the evaluation of Hashcat, after adding the top 100 digit semantics
rules in the large rule set Generated2, the newly guessed passwords
are 4.2× as much as that after adding 100,000 random rules, even
though those random rules generate guesses with one more order
of magnitude. Our study would help better understand the digit
semantics in passwords and shed light on a way to optimize the
guessing efficiency of practical password cracking tools by utilizing
semantics.
