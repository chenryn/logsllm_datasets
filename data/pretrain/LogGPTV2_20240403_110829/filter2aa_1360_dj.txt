the effectiveness of said policy. It is for these reasons that appropriate and 
responsible use, rather than specific products or technologies, are the 
foundation of this section.
For those in the public sector, specifically law enforcement, always be thoughtful regarding any reasonable 
expectation of privacy. U.S. courts have ruled consistently in favor of online undercover infiltration tactics based 
on the fact that a reasonable person knows that others on the internet may not be who they purport to be. 
Where we can get ourselves into trouble is when we cross over into what could be considered private 
communication. One example is recovering an unlocked smart phone from an arrestee and noticing that the 
phone is receiving social media messages. You would not want to pretend to be the phone's owner and engage 
in conversations without appropriate court granted authority, such as a search warrant. Another scenario is a 
victim allowing you to use their social media account for direct communication. Some jurisdictions consider any 
communication outside a "group chat" private and you may be required to obtain a legal order to continue any 
type of private or direct messaging using a third party's identity, even if it is with consent. Much depends on the 
jurisdiction in which you are working, which can get complicated when your cooperating victim and the suspect 
are in two different states, or in some cases, different countries.
are typically presented in
If your organization requires language around "interaction", such as "friending", make this as non-specific as 
possible. Some agencies also restrict the use of covert social media accounts, which will extremely limit the 
effectiveness of your OSINT work. You have to educate management and legal advisors on the importance of 
covert accounts in building actionable intelligence. Decades of case law supports the use of "undercover" 
operations for traditional investigations and online investigations should be treated no differendy. If you are 
forced to accept some restrictions related to covert accounts or infiltration, push for them to be contained within 
SOPs rather than agency policy. Continue to lobby for a reasonable standard utilizing appropriate concepts and 
language that is not overly specific. Common phrases of this type of language include "for lawful purposes", 
"consistent with agency training and standards", and "when feasible and reasonable".
I am not an attorney and the best path is always to solicit advice from legal counsel that is familiar with the local, 
state, and federal laws affecting your jurisdiction. Common sense goes a long way and I always ask myself if

3) Report the incident to law enforcement: Reporting requirements will vary between jurisdictions, but ethical 
responsibilities for reporting are universal. Although your local law enforcement agency may not have the 
capabilities to investigate the incident fully, you will have created a trail of documentation which demonstrates 
personal due diligence and effort on behalf of your organization.
4) Report the incident to NCMEC: Report the content to the National Center for Missing & Exploited 
Children (missingkids.org/gethelpnow/cybertipline). Memorialize this reporting in your notes and consider 
saving a screenshot of your submission.
In the course of our investigative work, there are times where we might locate content that is, by its very nature, 
illegal. If we are investigating crimes such as child exploitation, this might be intentional. We should be fully 
trained on how to appropriately document that digital evidence. Investigative units which do that type of specific 
work are less scrutinized than those who unintentionally stumble into digital contraband. These people often 
find themselves unprepared to deal with the ramifications. Those who work specifically in roles investigating 
child exploitation will already have more detailed processes and policies in place.
Although there is a range of digital contraband which could potentially fall into this category, the most critical 
issue to address in your process and policy is Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM). Within the open source 
intelligence community, specifically the crowd-sourced programs investigating missing or exploited persons, we 
see an increase of investigators locating material with a reporting requirement. 1 am not an attorney. 1 
recommend investigators within the U.S. becoming familiar with Title 18 Part 1 Chapter 110 Section of 2258A 
of the U.S. legal code (https://www.law.comell.edu/uscode/text/18/2258/\).
There are a couple of important distinctions when it comes to CSAM in regard to semantics. Many laws in the 
U.S. and elsewhere still use the term "child pornography", which is widely considered as dated and inaccurate. 
Although you may need to use that terminology in the charging documents required by your jurisdiction, I 
recommend using the term "child sexual abuse material" in your notes and incident documentation. This, or the 
acronym CSAM, are generally accepted as the preferred terminology. First, let's address what you should do if 
you stumble onto content which you feel may be CSAM, or otherwise require reporting responsibility. The 
following are recommendations for those who do not already have a policy.
2) Notify a supervisor Due diligence is essential in these incidents. One of your first actions should be 
notifying a superior to show that everything is above board. This can also ensure that all appropriate procedure 
and policy requirements are met. They may have additional responsibilities related to the scenario of which you 
are unaware. Even if mistakes are made along the way, we must show that we made every effort to act in good 
faith.
1) Do not capture it: We typically want to capture any online content for preservation when we find potential 
evidence of a crime. However, there are two primary' reasons to avoid capturing CSAM. The first is to protect 
the victims. The last thing we want is unnecessary' copies of harmful material being created, and possibly leaked, 
due to mishandling of data. Next, many jurisdictions define mere possession of CSAM images and video as a 
felony offense. Although your intentions may be noble, collecting this material could create legal consequences. 
If you are trained to handle evidence in these types of investigations, follow your defined procedure. Otherwise, 
it is best to only record URLs and other non-graphic material.
there is any way a target could argue a reasonable expectation of privacy. Additionally, being good stewards of 
privacy is important when building trust with our communities. We never want to portray any hint of 
recklessness during intelligence gathering. Practice good documentation during the process in order to build 
favorable case law and maintain as many' of our tools as possible.

Policy, Ethics, & Development 505
Employees in the course of their normal duties may encounter materials on the 
internet which by their very nature demand action in regard to notifications and 
proper handling. This policy aims to provide a baseline set of procedures which 
support the proper handling of any incident involving illegal digital content 
and/or specifically child sexual abuse material (CSAM).

they were under 18 years of age.
an analogue or digital format.
6) Document the incident: Create a concise record to memorialize encountering the contraband material. If 
you are uncertain what to document, consider including the date, time, investigator, supervisor, URLs, and 
description of the contents. You want to convey an understanding of why you believe the material may be 
contraband.
The previous recommendations are not a replacement for preparing a proper and well defined procedure for 
handling illegal digital material. Although I am not a believer in having policy just for the sake of policy, this is 
an area of potential liability. You would be wise to also consider a written policy reflecting and supporting your 
prescribed best practices. You might need it to defend yourself or a colleague against allegations of criminal or 
negligent behavior. If that occurs, a written policy shows your organization is professional and squared away. 
The following is a very general framework for a CSAM policy.
Instances of illegal online content to include CSAM will be reported to the 
appropriate legal authority. Additionally, employees will notify a supervisor
The largest pitfalls in properly handling this material are in the reporting. Again, we do not create copies of the 
photos or videos unless we are trained to do so. We want to document enough information to direct authorities 
to intervene, and yet we want to be certain that we are not making things worse for the victim(s).
CSAM - Child sexual abuse material consists of any still, video, or audio data 
depicting any sexually explicit conduct involving a minor.
7) Wellness: Even for seasoned investigators, exposure to CSAM or other materials depicting victimization can 
be very disturbing. There can be lasting personal emotional impacts if not properly addressed. It is entirely 
appropriate to speak with a professional counselor or other support personnel following an exposure to images, 
video, and even secondhand accounts of inhumane acts. It is important to take care of yourself, subordinates, 
and colleagues following a CSAM exposure, whether due to an investigation or an unintentional discover}' while 
doing other online research.
5) Report it to the involved platform: The timing and appropriateness of this will depend on the platform. If 
the platform itself is potentially involved in the criminal activity, we do not want to tip our hand. Also, we want 
to make sure we notify law enforcement first so they have an opportunity to preserve evidence. Most platforms 
will retain digital evidence in CSAM incidents, but not all. Law enforcement will typically serve them with a 
preservation letter to request that an offline backup is maintained in the course of executing content removal.

immediately upon discovering said content. The supervisor will document the 
incident and ensure that material which is exploitive in nature is not further 
propagated.
Once you have a policy drafted it is wise to have it reviewed by your in-house council or other legal advisory 
body. Remember to provide training for employees on both the policy and procedures. A baseline of awareness 
will save you a fair amount of stress when an incident involving CSAM occurs during an investigation or 
intelligence operation.
Personnel will not copy or otherwise reproduce any material that is believed to 
be child sexual abuse material. Every effort will be made to capture location 
information such as internet addresses, IP addresses, and/or domain names without 
including any media that could cause further exposure or harm to the depicted 
victim(s).
If you are a student or non-professional OSINT practitioner, consider starting a conversation with your 
instructors and peers about the proper handling of illicit materials. If you join a crowd-sourced or charity event 
related to crimes against children, please ask the organizers for direction and education regarding appropriate 
procedures for responding to occurrences of CSAM or other digital contraband. As with most other aspects of 
online investigations, the key is having a plan and showing that a reasonable level of due diligence applied.
Equipment exposed to sensitive and potentially illegal material will be examined 
by appropriate technology personnel to ensure that any digital contraband is 
removed and that the workstation or systems in question are appropriately 
sanitized prior to further use.

Privacy’ is certainly the cornerstone of ethical considerations related to open source intelligence gathering, but I 
will also be discussing issues of intent and deception. Privacy is a broad issue and will pertain to almost every 
portion of our case. Deception becomes pertinent when we engage in active covert measures such as undercover 
accounts or "friending" targets.
My decision to press forward on the second scenario is based on the seriousness of the crime. or a situation 
like crimes against children, you need to exhaust all reasonable means up until there is a certainty’ at t e persons 
of interest bear no public threat. I am still obeying all laws, but it is far more reasonable for me to sort t roug 
the entirety’ of someone's public data if failing to do so might cause extraordinary’ harm to someone. e 
seriousness of the crime being investigated justifies a far broader scope of investigation and level of intrusion.
While some data on the internet is clearly public, there is questionable data that is publicly accessible and legally 
obtained, despite the owner intending it to be private. An example of this might be an Elasticsearc ata ase 
that was improperly configured. If we can access it via a browser and providing no credentials, we s ou e in

difference in deciding if it is appropriate to use them.
Examples of strong use cases would be defensive vulnerability assessments or investigations into crimes against 
children. We always want to balance the degree of impact on another individual s privacy’ with the greater goo 
being served by the mission. If I am merely investigating a misdemeanor crime or gathering intelligence a out 
what looks to be a peaceful community’ event, I am going to be far less aggressive in accessing any sites or ata

deep are you going to dig and what is the appropriate balance between purpose and level of intrusion? Here are 
two scenarios from the law enforcement world that represent opposing ends of the spectrum.
Scenario #1:1 receive a report of online threats against a public official and am asked to make an assessment 
and if necessary’, identify the owner of the account. I locate the account and posts in question and immediately’ 
see that although they are mean spirited, the comments do not articulate a true intended threat. A common 
example of this is similar to, "I hope you get cancer". It is a terrible thing to say, but there is no threat implied. 
At this point, I can report back to my boss that there is no threat If necessary’, I can show her a screenshot of 
the post. 1 have accomplished the mission and there is no justification to dig into the details of that person's life.
Scenario #2: We receive a tip from an internet service provider that a specific IP address is pushing traffic 
containing a large amount of child pornography’. I investigate the IP address and find that it is a listed Tor exit 
node. That means the person operating the router at the associated residence or business is allowing people on 
Tor to funnel their internet traffic through their device. So now I know there is a fair chance that the person at 
that residence is not direcdy’ involved in the child pornography and may be completely’ unaware of its presence. 
I do not stop my investigation. I dig up every’ piece of public data that I can on the people controlling that 
router.
508 Chapter 31
Deception is any behavior that misleads another person to believe something that is not true. This seems wrong 
when taken at face value, but there are occasions when deception is ethical and warranted. Take for example 
using social engineering to get your home address removed from a site-run data-mining company. You are doing 
no harm to others, but you are most certainly using deception to accomplish your goal.
The two most common forms of deception in open

or groups. Let's look at each of these and their ethical
Finally, I believe that we have an ethical responsibility to engage in ongoing training in both OSINT and privacy. 
Lack of familiarity with both technique and legal requirements leads to mistakes. Sloppy casework does a 
disservice to us all. We owe it to the people we serve, whether they are clients or victims of crimes, our best 
efforts and discretion in making sure that we uncover the truth and bring it to light. A big piece of protecting 
our tradecraft is showing that we wield our tools and talents with restraint and thoughtfulness.
Infiltration: Infiltration, such as "friending" individuals or joining social media groups, is far more invasive than 
merely using covert accounts to run queries. When you join a group, you are, to a small degree, changing the 
dynamics of that group. When you interact with a target on Facebook or in a forum by commenting on their 
posts, you are directly affecting them, even if it is in a very small or positive manner. Just as we demonstrated 
when making a comparison of scope, infiltration has its place in an ethically conducted OSINT investigation. 
Joining a criminal forum to gain the confidence of, and to deanonymize, child predators is a case where the 
greater good significantly outweighs the level of intrusion. I do not like limiting these types of tactics by policy, 
as that type of framework tends to be too rigid. However, I do want to always be able to articulate my justification 
before interacting with targets online.
Typically, my OSINT work is the result of a public safety event or statutory obligation, which allows for well- 
defined ethical grounds and clear justification. When I do run into "gray areas", it is usually when doing contract 
work for private sector clients. It is perfectly acceptable to conduct investigative work on behalf of a for-profit 
organization, but we do need to be clear on the intended use of any gathered intelligence. Often this is very 
straightforward. Common use cases are the vetting of vendors or potential employees. Another is vulnerability 
assessments on both the organization or C-level management. How the client intends to use our work product 
matters. We never want to be an unwitting part)7 to a harassment or cyberstalking situation.
1 don't always know all of the details of a case, but I need to be able to articulate the reasonable operational 
justification for digging into a person's life. This is not a high bar, but just as 1 do not follow a stranger on the 
street for no reason, I too show care and consideration when conducting investigative work on the internet. /\ 
good rule of thumb is that any OSINT work that provides personal gratification is a red flag. We don't stalk 
exes or someone that caught our eye on the train, even out of innocent curiosity7. Likewise, we don't cyber-stalk 
the guy in the car behind us in heavy traffic, who expresses his feelings towards us with a crude gesture. We are 
professional investigators and always leverage our skills in a professional manner.
Covert Accounts: The use of covert accounts violates the "terms of service" of most social media platforms 
and online services. However, covert accounts are critical to successful queries into social media platforms, and 
not authenticating with these services would hamper the effectiveness of our work. If our intent is good, we 
have articulated the reasonable justification for the use of these accounts and stayed within the confines of our 
investigation, this deception will not be invasive to the other users. We are one of many anonymous accounts.
One of the clearest examples of using OSINT for ill-intent is the practice of doxing. Doxing is using online 
research to profile an individual and then posting that information publicly on the internet with the intent of 
creating fear or embarrassment. The goal is to make the person feel exposed and show that you have power 
over them. It is cyber-harassment and it can even rise to the level of being a chargeable criminal offense.

inquiries I receive is regarding the establishment of a career in open source 
comes from individuals in the private sector who are new to online investigations and 
those in the public sector looking to move into OSINT as a specialization. Although some concepts are 
universal, let’s look at each of these scenarios. I will share some considerations for your new career.
If you look at practitioners in the open source intelligence field, you will find a wide variety of educational 
backgrounds. While there are universities that offer degrees and programs specific to analysis, intelligence, or 
investigations, I do not think you need to necessarily have that specific educational background. Many successful 
colleagues have degrees completely unrelated to this line of work, and many more received their education from 
the military or other organizations which provide internal training. Some employers will require a degree or a 
certain number of years of secondary education, but these prerequisites tend to be arbitrary. Many will accept 
work experience in place of educational requirements.
• 
Military Service: Many colleagues received their initial intelligence training and experience in the 
military. It is also one of the only paths which builds education and real-world experience while also 
affording you a modest living. Military sendee may also provide opportunities for language studies and 
exposure to other cultures, both of which are very valuable in our field.
• 
Law Enforcement/Gov: Many LE and government agencies have units or entire branches which 
provide intelligence operations, investigations, or other OSINT products on a daily basis. The downside 
to this approach is that those types of positions often require working through the ranks. You may need 
to provide many years of sendee prior to being eligible for placement into one of these specialized 
teams.
•
