how small ∆relay is. The reason the impossibility theorem
does not apply can be traced back to Lemma 1: even given
identical local traces, correct nodes can resort to location
information to distinguish setting S a from S b. The proof is
similar to that of the T-protocol case, found in App. A.
Protocol. Informally, the P GT protocol requires that nodes
send authenticated messages containing a time-stamp set at
the time of sending and their own location. Upon receipt
of such a message m sent from a node B, the receiver A
calculates two estimates of the A, B distance. The ﬁrst esti-
mate is based on the diﬀerence of its own clock at reception
time (the start of reception) and m’s time-stamp. The sec-
ond one is calculated with the help of the location in m and
A’s location. If the two distance estimates are equal, and
m is authenticated, A accepts B as a neighbor. Note that
this protocol is a combination between the temporal and the
geographical packet leash [13].
Message Space. We specify the message space as follows:
{authA(t, l)}A∈V,t∈R(cid:62)0,l∈R2 ⊆ M
We call the message authA(t, l) a beacon message, t the
beacon-time of the message, and l the beacon-location of the
message.
Feasibility. With the following we deﬁne feasibility with
respect to to P GT.

to P GT, if the following conditions are satisﬁed:

6. DISCUSSION
6.1
Implications
The impossibility result points to a fundamental limitation
in securing communication ND with T-protocols. Any T-
protocol, regardless of the node clock accuracy or processing
power, can be attacked by an adversary capable of relaying
messages with a small enough delay. As we discuss in the
next paragraph, the space for attacks can seem relatively
small if v = vadv. Nevertheless, it can be large enough to
constitute a realistic threat, depending essentially on three
factors. One of these is very speciﬁc to the operational envi-
ronment, and deals with the following question: How prob-
able is it to have no link between two nodes at distance d?
This is because for every non-existing link the adversary can
set up a short-range relay attack.
For the two other factors, we turn to theorems 1 and 3.
These show that for an attack to be successful, the relay-
ing delay of the adversary has to be below the threshold
R
v . This implies the second factor - the expected threat
level. If the system designer aims at protecting the network
only against relatively limited, slow-relaying adversaries, T-
protocols can provide suﬃcient security (details in Section
6.3). The third factor is the ND range R. In some cases, the
system designer might be able to select a low R: this forces
the adversary to relay messages faster, but it also precludes
the discovery of nodes that are directly reachable but farther
than R. Nonetheless, R needs to be typically equal to the
communication range. Thus, for some wireless technologies,
ND using T-protocols will be more vulnerable than for oth-
ers. For example, if we can consider relatively short-range
802.11 radios, communicating typically at 100 to 150m, the
threshold is 100m
sible 40ns relaying delay reported by [23]. For WiMAX,
with a range up to 50km, the threshold is around 166µs
leaving much more space for attacks. In fact, as R → ∞,
c ≈ 333ns, still signiﬁcantly above the fea-
T-protocols become useless for securing ND, if obstacles can
be present in the environment.
In short, T-protocols need to be used with a lot of caution to
secure ND. Unless there are no obstacles in the environment,
the ND range is low, or only slow-relaying adversaries are
of concern, T-protocols cannot provide reliable security, as
they are able to prevent only wormholes ranging beyond
R. For generally applicable secure ND it is necessary to
go beyond the T-protocol class. As Theorem 4 shows, one
possibility is the TL-class with protocols such as P GT which
can secure ND regardless of ∆relay or R. Unfortunately, P GT
is more demanding on the nodes (location awareness), and
it requires line-of-sight communication (Section 6.3).
Simple Quantitative Results. Theorem 1 and Theorem 2
show that it is impossible to secure ND even if the adversary
cannot utilize an adversarial channel for the communication
of the nodes it controls (but in that case it uses directional
antennas). However, quantitatively, the relative magnitude
of v and vadv, the signal propagation velocity across the
system wireless channel and the adversary channel, respec-
tively, determine the impact of the adversary.
To illustrate this, we consider ﬁrst an A(cid:48)(cid:48)
∆relay adversary and
the S b setting in Figure 2, with A, B correct and C adversar-
ial nodes, for which dist b(A, C) + dist b(B, C)+ v∆relay (cid:54) R.
These conditions are necessary for the attack to be possible.
The last inequality yields, when combined with the trian-
gle inequality dist b(A, B) (cid:54) dist b(A, C) + dist b(B, C), that
dist b(A, B) (cid:54) R − v∆relay. Note that the relative locations
and thus the distance of A and B are not controlled by
the adversary. This implies that the adversary can violate
ND1, only if the distance between A and B is smaller than
R − v∆relay and C is conveniently located.
∆relay and setting S c in Figure 2,
On the other hand, for A(cid:48)
dist c(C, D) + v∆relay (cid:54) R.
dist c(A, C) + dist c(D, B) + v
vadv
Utilizing this and the triangular inequality twice, that is,
dist c(A, B) (cid:54) dist c(A, C) + dist c(C, D) + dist c(D, B), we
v (R − v∆relay). If the last inequality
get dist c(A, B) (cid:54) vadv
holds, the adversary can succeed with the use of an adver-
sarial channel and two nodes C, D. It is interesting that the
bound on dist c(A, B) is multiplied by a factor of vadv
v . In
other words, if v (cid:191) vadv, as it holds, for example, for ul-
trasound and radio frequency velocities [24], the use of the
adversarial channel magniﬁes the impact on ND: the ad-
versary can mislead nodes at remote locations (thus unable
to communicate directly) that they are neighbors. Thus,
whenever possible, the system designer should aim at hav-
ing v = c, which she can expect to be the choice of the
adversary. This is further strengthened by the fact that the
P GT can be proven correct only if v = vadv.
Relation among Adversary Models. Intuitively, adver-
sary A2 is stronger than adversary A1, if A2 can do ev-
erything that A1 can. Formally, this is expressed as follows:
Definition 20. Adversary model A1 is (non-strictly) weaker
than adversary model A2 (A1 (cid:54) A2), if ΘS,P,A1 ⊆ ΘS,P,A2
9
for every setting S and every protocol model P.
Given this deﬁnition, we can order the considered adversary
models:
A(cid:48)
∆relay (cid:185) 4
∆relay (cid:54) A∆relay (cid:54) AT
A(cid:48)(cid:48)
∆relay
The relation among adversary models is interesting because
one can intuitively expect that if a protocol P can solve ND
for A1, it can also solve ND for a weaker adversary model
A2.5Thus, our impossibility result, proven for the minimal
elements, and the proof of correctness of protocol P T for the
maximal element, hold for all adversary models considered
in this paper. This clariﬁes that ∆relay is the most signiﬁcant
factor aﬀecting the security of ND, as opposed to the ability
to use directional antennas, the adversary channel, or to
generate arbitrary messages (in a Dolev-Yao fashion).
6.2 Modeling assumptions
Our ND speciﬁcation and assumptions about wireless com-
munication, protocols, and adversarial behavior all aim at
a simple model. Nonetheless, these assumptions do not im-
pair the generality and meaningfulness of our results. The
discussion below establishes this mostly with respect to the
impossibility result, as it is easy to see that most of these
simplifying assumptions do not aﬀect the ND protocols we
model and prove correct.
Protocol Model. Recall that our deﬁnition of a protocol
model only requires that the behavior of the protocol is de-
termined by the local view. This is much broader than the
typical approach, in which a protocol is modeled by a Turing
machine. But as our deﬁnition is an over-approximation, our
impossibility result remains valid for more realistic protocol
models.
Settings and Traces. We emphasize that the general forms
of settings (correct nodes being able to communicate at ar-
bitrary distances), and Medium Access Control modeling
(Deﬁnition 4 not prohibiting a correct node from sending
and receiving an arbitrary number of messages at the same
time) is not essential to the impossibility result. It is pos-
sible to add additional constraints to make the model more
realistic, but this would impair generality and clarity.
4We use a diﬀerent notation, A(cid:48)
∆relay (cid:185) A∆relay , as the “(cid:54)”
relation does not hold:
in one case the adversarial nodes
can only use Bcast and in the other only Dcast. However,
Bcast(m) is equivalent to a Dcast(0, 2π, m). Accordingly, we
can deﬁne a renaming function ρ, and show that the (cid:54) rela-
) ⊆ ΘS,P,A∆relay
tion holds up to renaming: ρ(ΘS,P,A(cid:48)
.
5This can be proven under the assumption that the adver-
sary model allows the adversarial nodes to remain silent,
which is the case for all the adversary models that we con-
sider. There exist adversarial models for which this does not
hold, but they are of no practical importance.
∆relay
Events. We model correct nodes equipped with omnidirec-
tional antennas. We can extend our model so that correct
nodes use directional antennas, but from the structure of the
impossibility result proof it should be clear that this would
not lift the impossibility. Mounting a successful relay attack,
however, would require adversarial node(s) to be located on
or close to the line connecting A and B.
We model success and failure (in fact, complete unawareness
of failure) in receiving a message, but not the ability of a
receiver to detect a transmission (wireless medium activity)
without successfully decoding the message. An extension
of our model to include this is straightforward and would
not aﬀect the impossibility result. Intuitively, if nodes were
able to solve the ND problem if they cannot decode all the
messages they receive, then they would also be able to solve
ND when all messages are received correctly. We emphasize
that the above argument relies on the assumption that nodes
cannot control their wireless transmission power. However,
if nodes had this ability, the notion of neighborhood would
change, and our model would need to change as well. We
will investigate this in future work.
ND Speciﬁcation. In light of the impossibility result, one
could consider an alternative, less restrictive neighbor dis-
covery speciﬁcation, notably, the already mentioned multi-party
ND that requires the participation of more than two nodes
to securely conclude on a neighbor relation. This is an inter-
esting direction resonating with emergent properties of ad-
hoc networks [9]. Technically, this ND speciﬁcation would
diﬀer in the ND2 property, where the requirement that the
protocol needs to work for some two-node setting would be
changed to an arbitrary setting. As discuss in Section 7,
there exist protocols in the literature related to our notion
of multi-party ND, but they are eﬀective under weaker ad-
versary models. Whether some other T-protocol can solve
multi-party ND in our model is an open question we plan to
investigate in future work.
Line-of-sight Propagation. Deﬁnition 4 implies signal prop-
agation over a straight line. In reality, this is not always the
case, as two nodes could communicate even if there is no
line-of-sight between them, and the signal is, for example,
reﬂected. We could include this phenomenon in our model,
for example, by introducing an additional link-speciﬁc delay
to the propagation time. This would not aﬀect any of our
results. However, from a practical point of view, for such
additionally delayed links, P T and especially P GT could re-
ject valid neighbor relations. This problem relates to the
discussion on inaccuracies in time and location information
these protocols need to cope with in practice, in Section 6.3.
6.3 Protocol Design
We discuss some of the more important aspects for actual
deployment of secure neighbor discovery protocols. First,
we consider one side of ND: A discovers if B is a neighbor.
However, with asymmetric links, a dual problem exists: A
discovers if it is a neighbor to B. The protocols we con-
sider are not designed to solve this problem, but we note
that challenge-response schemes, such as distance bounding
protocols [2], can.
