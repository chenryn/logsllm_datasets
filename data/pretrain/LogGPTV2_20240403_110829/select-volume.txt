**Applies to:**

- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `select volume` command is used to choose a specific volume and shift the focus to it. This command can also be used to display the volume that currently has the focus on the selected disk.

**Syntax:**
```plaintext
select volume=<volume_number|drive_letter|mount_point>
```

**Parameters:**
- **`<volume_number>`**: The number of the volume to receive the focus. You can view the numbers for all volumes on the currently selected disk by using the `list volume` command in DiskPart.
- **`<drive_letter>`**: The drive letter of the volume to receive the focus.
- **`<mount_point>`**: The mount point path of the volume to receive the focus.

**Remarks:**
- If no volume is specified, the command displays the volume that currently has the focus on the selected disk.
- On a basic disk, selecting a volume also gives the focus to the corresponding partition.
- If a volume with a corresponding partition is selected, the partition will be automatically selected.
- If a partition with a corresponding volume is selected, the volume will be automatically selected.

**Examples:**
- To shift the focus to volume 2, type:
  ```plaintext
  select volume=2
  ```
- To shift the focus to Drive C, type:
  ```plaintext
  select volume=C
  ```
- To shift the focus to the volume mounted on a folder named `c:\mountpath`, type:
  ```plaintext
  select volume=c:\mountpath
  ```
- To display the volume that currently has the focus on the selected disk, type:
  ```plaintext
  select volume
  ```

This command is essential for managing volumes and partitions in DiskPart, allowing you to specify which volume or partition you are working with.
