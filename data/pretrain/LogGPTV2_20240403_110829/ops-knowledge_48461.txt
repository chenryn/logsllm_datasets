User: Is there a way to access variables in the current python kernel from within a %%bash or other %%script cell?
Perhaps as command line arguments or environment variable(s)?
Assistant: No, %%script magic are autogenerated and don't do any magic inter-process data communication. (which is not the case for %%R but which is a separate magic in its own class with extra care from R peoples)
But writing your own magic that does it is not too hard to do.
