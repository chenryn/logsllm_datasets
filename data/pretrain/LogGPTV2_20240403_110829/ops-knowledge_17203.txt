Assistant: This log chunk shows the process of reading a broadcast variable, storing it in memory, and then executing tasks related to it. The log also shows the time taken for each step of the process. The broadcast variable was read in 8 ms, stored in memory with an estimated size of 9.7 KB, and five tasks were executed with times ranging from 38-41 ms. Two additional tasks were assigned to the executor backend.
