Abstract—In  Ciphertext  Policy  Attribute  Based  Encryption 
(CP-ABE)a  previously  defined  association  between 
the 
attributes  of  a  user  and  the  ciphertext  associated  with  these 
attributes is exploited to determine the secret key of the user. 
However, for a user with multiple attributes, the length of the 
key depends on the number of attributes. The existing methods 
that  use  reasonably  computable  decryption  policies  produce 
the ciphertext of size at least linearly varying with the number 
of  attributes.  In  this  paper,  we  propose  two  schemes.  One 
scheme  is  of  variable  length  based  on  Bethencourt  et  al. 
construction.  In  second  scheme,  the  ciphertext  remains 
constant in length, irrespective of the number of attributes. It 
works for a threshold case: the number of attributes in a policy 
must be a subset of attributes in a secret key. The security of 
scheme is based on Decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) 
problem. 
Keywords-Attribute;  Attribute  based  encryption;  ciphertext

INTRODUCTION 
to 
(PKC)  proposed 
Encryption is the one of primitive that provides security and 
confidentiality to the digital communications. In traditional 
symmetric key cryptography (SKC),the sender and receiver 
both share the same secret key. However, use of the SKC is 
besieged  with  the  problems  related  to  the  key  distribution 
and  management.  On  the  other  hand,  the  Public  Key 
Cryptography 
circumvent  key 
management  issues  is  not  efficient  in  a  multicast  setup  as 
also for bulk encryption/decryption [1]. In addition the PKC 
suffers  from 
in  key  assignment  and 
the  complexity 
certificate management issues.  
Identity  Based  Encryption  (IBE)  was  proposed  to 
obviate the need for a user to possess a certificate obtained 
using PKI, a priori IBE, proposed first in [2] relies on using 
the  global  identities  of  a  user  as  his  public  key,  with  the 
corresponding (i.e. associated with his identity) private key 
being assigned by a globally trusted Key Generation Centre 
(KGC)  after  due  authentication  of  a  user.  Any  user  could 
encrypt a message using the global identity of the destined 
user,  whereas  a  user,  whose  identity  in  his  secret  key 
matches  with  the  same  in  the  ciphertext,  alone  would  be 
able to decrypt the same.  
In the traditional IBE systems, the identity of a user is 
specified using either the name, the email ID, or the network 
address – a string of characters. This makes it cumbersome

to  establish  the  necessary  correlation  between  a  user’s 
identity (in his private key) and the same associated in the 
ciphertext  that  he  intends  to  decrypt.  This  is  so,  because 
even slight mismatch would render the match as a failure.  
Hence, in a variant of the traditional IBE, the identity is 
specified in the form of descriptive attributes. In the first of 
such scheme proposed as Fuzzy Identity Based Encryption 
(FIBE)  in  [3],  a  user  with  identity  W  could  decrypt  the 
ciphertext meant for a user with identity W’, if and only if 
|W  -  W’|  >  d,  where  d  is  some  threshold  value    defined 
initially.  
In  [4],  the  authors  propose  more  expressive  ABE 
schemes  in  the  form  of  two  different  systems  viz.  Key 
Policy Attribute Based Encryption (KP-ABE). In KP-ABE, 
a ciphertext is associated with a defined set of attributes and 
user’s  secret  key  is  associated  with  a  defined  policy 
containing  those  attributes.  Hence,  the  secret  key  could  be 
used successfully only if the attribute access structure policy 
defined  in  the  key,  matches  with  the  attributes  in  the 
ciphertext.  As  compared  to  the  same,  the  authors  in  [5] 
propose a fully functional Ciphertext Policy Attribute Based 
Encryption  (CP-ABE)  in  which  a  user’s  secret  key  is 
associated with a defined set of attributes and the ciphertext 
is  associated  with  a  defined  policy.  In  [6],  the  authors 
propose  a  protocol  for  conversion  from  KP-ABE  to  CP-
ABE. One of the limitations of CP-ABE schemes is that the 
length  of  ciphertext  is  dependent  on  the  number  of 
attributes.  That  is,  with  s  being  the  number  of  attributes 
involved in the policy, the ciphertext length is O(s3). 
An  efficient  construction  of  the  CP-ABE  in  terms  of 
ciphertext length can be found in [7-8]. In these schemes, the 
size  of  ciphertext  depends  linearly  on  the  number  of 
attributes.  For  example  in  (t,n)  threshold  scheme,  with  t  or 
more  attributes  to  be  used  of  out  a  total  of  n  attributes  for 
decryption  by  a  user,  the  size  of  the  ciphertext  is  either 
n+O(1)[7]  OR  2(n-t)+O(1)  [8].  Both  these  schemes  are 
based on the secret sharing schemes by Shamir [9] and use 
the monotonic access structure. In [10], the size of ciphertext 
is  2n+O(1).  However,  as  is  clear  from  these  expressions 
itself the ciphertext length in all these cases is dependent on 
the number of attributes in one way or the other. Ideally, one 
would  desire  to  break  this  relationship  further  and  make 
ciphertext length independent of the attributes.

the authors propose a constant length ciphertext using the (t, 
t)  threshold  system  i.e. the  number  of  attributes  in  a  user’s 
secret  key  is  equal  to  the  number  of  attributes  in  the 
ciphertext policy. In addition, this scheme achieves constant 
secret  key  length,  too.  A  further  improved  version  is 
proposed  in  [12],which  is  a  (t,  n)constant  length  ciphertext 
ABE  scheme.  This  scheme  is  based  on  the  dynamic 
threshold encryption scheme in [13]. 
Apart  from  the  constant  ciphertext  length,  it  is  also 
necessary to ensure the collusion resistance. That is, when a 
number of users collude to decrypt a ciphertext, they should 
be able to decrypt the ciphertext only if one of them on his 
own is able to do so [5].  
All of these approaches use a single authority in ensuring 
either  variable  or  constant  ciphertext  length  with/without 
collusion resistance. In a single authority system, the entire 
trust  is  on  the  single  authority,  so  if  the  authority  is 
compromised then the entire system is compromised.  
To  deal  with  single  point  of  failure,  the  traditional 
approach followed in distributed systems is to distribute the 
responsibility amongst multiple entities. In [14], the authors 
propose the idea of a multi-authority system in which there 
are arbitrary numbers of attribute authorities (AA) with one 
central  authority  (CA).  Obviously,  such  schemes  require 
mutual  trust  between  the  AAs  and  the  CA.  In  [15-19] 
authors  propose  different  approaches  to  deal  with  this 
limitation of the multi authority system.  
However, our focus here in this paper is on investigating 
whether  is  it  possible  to  ensure  constant  ciphertext  length 
ABE scheme with collusion resistance using multi-authority 
approach?  
We  attempt  to  propose  the  first  collusion  resistant  multi 
authority  ABE  with  the  constant  size  ciphertext.  However, 
our approach necessitates that the attributes in the ciphertext 
must  be  a  subset  of  user’s  attributes  in  his  secret  key.  For 
if  we  had  one  user  Harry  with  attributes 
example, 
“Name=Harry”, “University = Stanford”, “Branch = EE”. In 
this scenario, if some arbitrary sender sends a message to all 
the EE branch students of Stanford University, Harry would 
be  able  to  decrypt  the  message  because  the  number  of 
attributes in his policy is the subset of the user’s attributes. 
We  propose  a  protocol  for  the  purpose.  We  believe  that 
our  scheme  is  an  improvement  over  [5]  as  it  works  with 
multi-authorities unlike [5]. The security of our protocol is 
based on DBDH assumptions as that in [5] 
The  rest  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In  the
