User: I started learning Python 3.4 and would like to start using libraries as well as Google App Engine, but the majority of Python libraries only support Python 2.7 and the same with Google App Engine.
Should I learn 2.7 instead or is there an easier way? (Is it possible to have 2 Python versions on my machine at the same time?)
Assistant: YES! Google App engine supports python v3, you need to set up flexible environments.
I got a chance to deploy my application on app engine and It's using python 3.6 runtime and works smoothly... :)
