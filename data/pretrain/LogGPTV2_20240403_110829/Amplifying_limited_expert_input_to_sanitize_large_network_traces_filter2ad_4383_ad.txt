### Variables of Interest and Model Formulation

In our analysis, we distinguish between variables that are not of primary interest (such as the specific datasets used or the varying skill levels of our workers) and those that are of particular interest (e.g., the use of clustering and alignment). The random effects in our model account for the former, while the fixed effects incorporate the latter.

The model can be formulated as:
\[ y = \beta_c \cdot x_c + \beta_a \cdot x_a + \beta_{ca} \cdot x_c \cdot x_a + \epsilon \]
where:
- \( x_c \) and \( x_a \) are binary variables indicating whether clustering and alignment are used, respectively.
- \( y \) is the performance measure under consideration (e.g., F-score or efficiency).
- \( \beta_c \), \( \beta_a \), and \( \beta_{ca} \) are the coefficients for clustering, alignment, and their interaction effect, respectively.
- \( \epsilon \) represents the random effects derived from workers and datasets.

### F-Score Analysis

To test the null hypotheses \( \beta_c = \beta_a = \beta_{ca} = 0 \), we fit all observations of the F-scores (\( F_\alpha \)) of the best workers using the above model, with \( \alpha \) set to 1.2. We consider a p-value < 0.05 as the threshold for rejecting a null hypothesis.

**Results:**
- **Clustering**: The hypothesis \( \beta_c = 0 \) is rejected (p-value = 0.011), and the estimate of \( \beta_c \) is positive (0.217), indicating a significant positive relationship between clustering and \( F_\alpha \).
- **Alignment**: Similarly, the hypothesis \( \beta_a = 0 \) is rejected (p-value = 0.017), and the estimate of \( \beta_a \) is 0.197, suggesting that alignment significantly increases \( F_\alpha \).
- **Interaction Effect**: There is little evidence of an interaction effect between clustering and alignment (p-value = 0.123), meaning the hypothesis \( \beta_{ca} = 0 \) stands. Even if the hypothesis had been rejected, the estimate of \( \beta_{ca} \) (-0.160) is smaller in absolute value than both \( \beta_c \) and \( \beta_a \), indicating an additive effect of these two factors in improving \( F_\alpha \).

### Efficiency Analysis

Another important consideration is how clustering and alignment influence efficiency, defined as:
\[ \text{Efficiency} = \frac{\mid \{\text{identified fields}\} \mid}{t} \]
where \( t \) represents the total time to completion in each trial.

**Results:**
- **Clustering**: The estimate for the clustering term (3.311) shows a strong, statistically significant correlation between clustering and efficiency (p-value = 0.007).
- **Alignment and Interaction**: No statistically significant effect of alignment or the interaction term is found (p-values of 0.271 for \( \beta_a \) and 0.147 for \( \beta_{ca} \)). However, the tests still indicate that a user's efficiency benefits from both clustering and alignment together, due to the strong positive influence of clustering.

### Discussion

Our methodology yielded a recall of 0.9 and even better precision for the UNV-DNS dataset, which is encouraging given the complexity of the DNS protocol. While it might seem beneficial to allow more time for packet marking, our observations suggest that this would yield diminishing returns. Packet inspection is a tiresome process, and none of our participants chose to continue past 30 minutes, despite the option to do so. Therefore, additional innovations may be required to assist workers in identifying sensitive fields more accurately.

Our methodology provides a framework for identifying sensitive fields in packets, but additional steps must be taken to anonymize those fields according to the desired policies. A natural question is whether the workers' F-scores were "good enough" to provide a basis for sanitizing the full datasets. This depends on the data owner's goals for sanitization, which are often difficult to specify or measure. Our accompanying technical report [13] suggests that the approach works well when applied to trace sanitization.

### Conclusion

We presented a methodology for supporting the task of sanitizing network packet payloads. Our approach is inspired by cognitive science studies and addresses the complexity of modern protocols. By involving humans in the process, we can handle the diversity and size of network traces. Our evaluation demonstrated the effectiveness of our methodology through a user study, showing that it can be effective in supporting the sanitization of large network datasets.

### Appendix

Our prototype graphical user interface (GUI) used in the user study is composed of one main panel and two sub-panels. The main panel displays representative packets from one cluster, with each row corresponding to a representative and each column to a token in the packet. The sub-panels show the raw bytes of the packet currently in focus, in hexadecimal and printable ASCII formats, allowing the worker to focus on specific tokens and view them in different formats.
