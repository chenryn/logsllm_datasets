## Problem Description
If I render the slider with code like:
And then I call `setState` to increase `max`, the slider does not update the
position of the marker. If I increase `max` again, then the marker position
updates to be where it should have been on the previous render (e.g. it is
still wrong).
For example,
  * first render, max={100} value={50} and the marker appears in the middle of the slider as it should.
  * second render, max={200} value={50} and the marker is _still_ in the middle of the slider (it should be at the 25% position)
  * third render, max={400} value={50} and the marker is now at the 25% mark (it should be at the 12.5% position).
This issue seems related to #3619.
