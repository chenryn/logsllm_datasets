The Voice Interoperability Plan for Emergency Responders (VIPER) 
system will be fully operational Statewide by FY 2009.  The ambitious 
project will integrate communications with state and local entities and 
is being managed by the North Carolina State Patrol.  This will be very 
helpful in response efforts and providing assistance across jurisdictional boundaries.

Current Interoperable Communications Initiatives 
North Dakota is working to ensure that they have interoperable 
communications throughout the state by updating their equipment and 
placing towers/repeaters.  Their major concern is that with rural nature 
of their state. As a result, they have been creative is setting up their 
systems. 
North Dakota continues to 
improve their communications 
to ensure that they can 
communicate within the 
counties as well as throughout 
the state.

• Ohio has implemented the Multi-Agency Radio Communication 
System (MARCS) within the state.  It currently provides 800 MHZ 
voice and data communications to first responders and public safety 
personnel within 14 state agencies.  Also, interfaced into the system are 
all Ohio County Sheriffs, emergency management agencies/Emergency 
Operations Centers (EOC) and hospitals and health departments.  The 
MARCS is open to all who are interested with over 600 local 
government agencies currently interfaced into the system. To date, they have 
accomplished 97.5% mobile voice and data coverage per county.  A pilot project was 
implemented in Union County, Ohio, placing all first responders on the MARCS as their 
primary radio system.  The pilot was highly successful providing all county users with 
greater coverage, clarity, system capacity and full interoperability.  
• Ohio has purchased 11 mobile communications vehicles equipped with all radio 
frequencies, cellular and landline phones, weather monitoring equipment, internet access 
and gateway patching 
devices.  These vehicles 
also include surveillance 
capabilities through 
regular and infrared 
cameras.  The vehicles 
have already 
demonstrated their benefit 
during special events, 
exercises and actual 
incidents by improving 
the communications 
capabilities of the 
responders.

Current Interoperable Communications Initiatives 
Oklahoma has dedicated over $28 million in grant funds towards 
interoperable communication projects.  The major initiative is a multi-
phased 800 MHz project to increase interoperability along the Interstate 
44 corridor where the majority of the State's population is located.  
Phase I should be complete by November 2006. Phase II will complete 
the I-44 corridor and is expected to be completed by Spring of 2007. To ensure interoperability, 
all 800 MHZ equipment including repeaters, dispatch base consoles, control stations, antennas, 
mobile units and handheld units are capable of APCO Project 25 Phase One standards.  
The Oklahoma Office of Homeland Security (OKOHS) has also focused interoperable 
communication funds on achieving tactical interoperable communications for the response units 
in each of the 8 regions. All of the 20 intermediate response units - both WMD response and 
Technical Rescue response -  and the 
5 large WMD response units - 
are being equipped with Tactical 
Interoperable Communications 
bridging technology. Future 
phases of the Interoperable 
Communications project will 
focus on continuing to expand 
the 800 MHZ system and 
achieving Tactical Interoperable 
Communications, to include 
rural communities, using 
solutions such as quick response 
mobile communications units 
and other cost effective means.

• 
Clackamas County: Clackamas County is currently working on an 800 
MHZ radio system. The system will provide coverage for highly populated 
areas such as Sandy and Estacada as well as large portions of HWY 26, 
Mount Hood recreational areas and Damacus, and the newly designated 
urban growth area.  FY2004 funded the four-site phase II of this project. 
• 
Polk County: Polk County has been working in conjunction with Yamhill 
county on a microwave project that will link Polk, Marion, and Yamill counties. The microwave 
radio equipment supports technologies that will be used in partnership with neighboring 
jurisdictions to enhance all entities voice radio coverage and to provide for new interoperability 
opportunities for everyone who is sharing this equipment and sites.  
• 
State Police: Oregon State Police implemented an Interstate Hwy 5 Interoperable 
communications project.  The completed project will provide communications connectivity up 
and down the I-5 corridor 
(the main and most 
traveled route through 
Oregon). 
•
