## The Problem

Compromising a network is not always straightforward. Traditional methods often face significant challenges, especially when dealing with well-secured networks.

---

## Compromise Scenario

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - **You:** Attacker
   - **Network:** Internet-connected
   - **Components:**
     - Servers
     - Workstations
     - Domain Controllers

2. **Disconnected Network:**
   - **Physical Boundary:** Separates the internet-connected network from a disconnected network.
   - **Components:**
     - Servers
     - Workstations
     - Domain Controllers

---

## The Solution

Sometimes, compromising a network might be closer than we think. This presentation explores how the Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) can be leveraged to compromise its clients.

---

## Potential Compromise Scenario

1. **Internet-Connected Network:**
   - **Components:**
     - WSUS Server
     - Servers
     - Workstations
     - Domain Controllers

2. **Disconnected Network:**
   - **Physical Boundary:** Separates the internet-connected network from the disconnected network.
   - **Components:**
     - WSUS Server
     - Servers
     - Workstations
     - Domain Controllers

## Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)

### Overview
- **Enterprise Network:**
  - **Protocols:**
    - HTTPS
    - HTTP
  - **Components:**
    - Microsoft Update
    - WSUS Server
    - WSUS Clients
    - Upstream and Downstream WSUS Servers
    - External Devices

### Updates Journey within a WSUS Server

1. **Windows Service:**
   - Downloads update metadata (binaries size, download URL, command-line arguments, etc.)
   - Transmits the metadata to the database

2. **Database:**
   - Parses metadata inputs and incorporates them into its tables

3. **Approval:**
   - Updates are approved either by an admin or by automatic approval rules

4. **Binary Download:**
   - Approved updates binaries (psf, cab, exe, etc.) are downloaded
   - Each binary signature is checked and stored for the Web service

5. **Client Interaction:**
   - Clients look for new updates
   - Web service gets approved updates metadata from the database
   - Metadata is transmitted to the WSUS clients
   - Each client evaluates if the update is installable
   - If installable, the associated binary is downloaded
   - Each downloaded binaryâ€™s signature is checked
   - Each binary is executed with SYSTEM privileges, using possible command-line parameters from the metadata

### Attack Steps

1. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Position:**
   - Gain a MitM position on the network
   - No network limitations in place
   - TLS must be disabled

2. **Intercept New Update Queries:**
   - Infect the on-network metadata with a new, malicious update

3. **Client Interaction:**
   - Client sees a new available and installable update
   - Fetches the related binary
   - Checks if the binary signature is valid
   - Installs the binary with SYSTEM privileges, using metadata command-line arguments

### Limitations
- Requires a MitM position
- TLS must be disabled
- Does not provide access to the disconnected network

## Introducing WSUSpendu

### Overview
- **Open-Source Project:**
  - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AlsidOfficial/WSUSpendu)
  - Special thanks to Maman

### Attack Steps

1. **Injection:**
   - Injects update metadata into the database and signed binary into the Web service

2. **Client Interaction:**
   - Client sees a new available and installable update
   - Fetches the related binary
   - Checks if the binary signature is valid
   - Installs the binary with SYSTEM privileges, using metadata command-line arguments

## Demonstration

### Compromising a Connected Network

- **Setup:**
  - Internet-connected network
  - Disconnected network
  - Physical boundary

### Compromising a Disconnected Network

- **Setup:**
  - Internet-connected network
  - Disconnected network
  - Physical boundary

---

## Conclusion

- **Key Takeaways:**
  - Regularly review and control the relationship between WSUS servers and their clients
  - Consider the potential risks and implement robust security measures
