Subject: Issue with Atom Installation on Windows

Hello Everyone,

I recently installed the latest version of Atom using the new installer from the official website, after completely removing the previous version that was installed via Chocolatey.

I am experiencing a peculiar issue: when I launch Atom from the command line using `atom .` or `atom ./myfile`, everything works as expected. However, if I open Atom using the desktop shortcut (or even by right-clicking and selecting "Open with Atom"), I encounter several problems. Specifically, I am unable to write anything or create new files, and the console is filled with "module did not register" errors for numerous modules.

This issue did not occur with my previous installation via Chocolatey, which worked perfectly fine.

Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
