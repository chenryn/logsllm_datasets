Hi all !
I'm on windows : installed with the new installer on the website after doing a
clean remove from chocolatey.
I have a weird problem : if i open atom from the commandline, with atom . or
atom ./myfile , then everything work fine. If i open it from the desktop
shortcut (or even right click open with atom) then, i can't write anything or
create new files, and i've got a bunch of "module did not register" in the
console from a load of module (all of them i guess ?)
It's a pretty weird bug, everything worked fine with my old chocolatey
version.
