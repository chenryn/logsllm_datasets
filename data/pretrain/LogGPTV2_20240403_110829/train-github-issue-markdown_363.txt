by **axel.schreiner** :
    This is using 'hg update release' on MacOS X Lion (hg update default and ./all.bash fail
    early on).
    Based on the package documentation I believe that data can be transfered to and from an
    interface-typed variable. This does not seem to be the case.
    The attached program can be run with the arguments ss is si ii to select a transfer from
    and to a struct or an interface. Additionally, the argument reg will register the
    structure with gob, but that does not change anything.
    What steps will reproduce the problem?
    1. compile the attached file
    2. run it with options ss and is -- no error message.
    3. run it with options si or ii -- error message from gob. 
    What is the expected output?
    No error message in case 3.
    What do you see instead?
    decoding error gob: wrong type received for local value main.Mer: Foo = struct { Bar
    string; Beque string; }
    Which compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?
    6g
    Which operating system are you using?
    MacOS X Lion
    Which revision are you using?  (hg identify)
