It's possible to interact with form controls by their ``, but not to
select them.
Other elements can also be labelled with `aria-label`/`aria-labelledby`, such
as:
    A list of things
      ...
but there isn't a way (that I'm aware of) to select an element with the label
'A list of things'.
The selector documentation gives the example
    await page.locator('[aria-label="Sign in"]').click();
which is enough when using `[aria-label]`.
## Suggestions
  * A `label` selector that works similar to `text` (`'label=A list of things'`, `'label="A list of things"'`, `'label=/A\\s*list\\s*of\\s*things/i'`) that works on `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby` and ``.
  * Recognise the `aria-labelledby` attribute and fill in `aria-label` with its text content. (Don't feel great, but means not extra selector.)
