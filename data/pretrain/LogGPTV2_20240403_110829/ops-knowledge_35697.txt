My colleague and I both use Macs, and we have the same version of PyCharm Professional (2016.3.2, build from December 28, 2016). We maintain our project directories in sync using a shared repository, and currently, these directories are identical. In our PyCharm preferences, we both have "Enable Google App Engine support" enabled, and the same directory is set as the "SDK directory," containing the same files.

When I select the menu option **Tools > Google App Engine > Upload App Engine app...**, the App Config Tool panel appears at the bottom of my PyCharm window. The first line in this panel is:

```
/usr/bin/python
  /Applications/GoogleAppEngineLauncher.app/Contents/Resources/GoogleAppEngine-default.bundle/Contents/Resources/google_appengine/appcfg.py
  update .
```

The last line is:

```
appcfg.py >
```

I can also execute the `update` command from a Terminal window without any issues.

However, when my colleague runs the same menu option, the App Config Tool panel only displays:

```
appcfg.py >
```

Despite extensive research and multiple attempts to resolve the issue, we have not been able to find a solution. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

**Additional Information:**

I recently performed a clean installation and no longer use the AppEngineLauncher, as it may not even be included with the newer SDK versions. My Google App Engine (GAE) is located here:

```
/usr/local/google-cloud-sdk/platform/google_appengine
```

It seems that you might be using an older version of the AppEngine SDK.
