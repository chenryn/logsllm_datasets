User: I installed homebrew and 
    which python
gives /usr/local/bin/python . However when I type which pip I get/usr/local/bin/pip and not the desired /usr/local/share/python/pip
How do I fix this?
Assistant: A linux command must be in a bin directory so you have no problem. Pip should be store in /usr/local/bin/pip not in /usr/local/share/python/pip.
