Abstract

This workshop summary gives a brief overview of
the workshop on HArchitecting Dependable Systems"
held in conjunction with DSN 2008. The main aim of
this workshop is to promote cross-fertilization between
the
dependability
communities. We believe that both ofthem will benefit
from clarifying approaches that have been previously
tested and have succeeded as well as those that have
been tried but have not yet been shown to be
successful.

Architecting Dependable Systems was organised
during the International Conference on Software
Engineering (leSE) 2002. Since then seven workshops
were organised and four books were published [1].
This series of workshops have shown to be a fertile
ground for both communities to clarify previous
approaches, thus helping to promote new topical areas
where the most promising research may lie, while
avoiding the reinvention of the wheel.

practice when dealing with dependability issues at the
architecture level. We are interested in submissions
from both industry and academia on all topics related
to software architectures for dependable systems.

4. Workshop Program
4.1. Keynote Speaker
Rick Schlichting will be our keynote speaker. He is
the Director of Software Systems Research at AT&T
Labs Research in Florham Park, NJ. He is well known
for his work on distributed systems, highly dependable
computing and fault tolerance, operating systems, and
networks. The title of his talk will be "Keys to
Architecting Dependable SOAs".

This year we are building on the theme of service
oriented architectures. Service oriented architectures
imply the organization and utilization of

different ownership domains, while providing uniform

capabilities to produce desired overall effects. They
provide new challenges
and opportunities when
considering the architecting of dependable systems.
The first question is
to analyze whether well(cid:173)
established approaches still hold in this context. The
fault models and other basic assumptions regarding
dependability may need to be revisited, giving rise to
