disc or CD, is inserted into a Windows PC (and autorun
is enabled), Windows looks on the disc for a ﬁle called
autorun.inf and executes commands contained in it.
Autorun is commonly used to pop up a splash screen or
simple menu (for example) to offer to install software
found on the disc. However, the autorun mechanism will
run any program that the disc speciﬁes.
Other popular operating systems, including MacOS X
and Linux, do not have an autorun feature, so this mecha-
nism does not work on those systems. XCP ships only
Windows code and so has no effect on other operat-
ing systems. MediaMax ships with both Windows and
MacOS code, but only the Windows code can autorun.
The MacOS code relies on the user to double-click an in-
staller, which few users will do. For this reason, we will
not discuss the MacOS version of MediaMax further.
Current versions of Windows ship with autorun en-
abled by default, but the user can choose to disable it.
Many security experts advise users to disable autorun
to protect against disc-borne malware. If autorun is dis-
abled, the XCP or MediaMax active protection software
will not load or run. Even if autorun is enabled, the user
can block autorun for a particular disc by holding down
the Shift key while inserting the disc [11]. This will pre-
vent the active protection software from running.
Even without disabling autorun, a user can prevent the
active protection software from loading by covering up
the portion of the disc on which it is stored. Both XCP
and MediaMax discs contain two sessions, with the ﬁrst
session containing the music ﬁles and the second session
containing DRM content, including the active protection
software and the autorun command ﬁle. The ﬁrst session
begins at the center of the disc and extends outward; the
second session is near the outer edge of the disc. By cov-
ering the outer edge of the disc, the user can prevent the
drive from reading the second session’s ﬁles, effectively
converting the disc back to an ordinary single-session au-
dio CD. The edge of the disc can be covered with non-
transparent material such as masking tape, or by writing
over it with a felt-tip marker [19]. Exactly how much of
the disc to cover can be determined by iteratively cover-
ing more and more until the disc’s behavior changes, or
by visually inspecting the disc to look for a difference in
appearance of the disc’s surface which is often visible at
the boundary between the two sessions.
4.2 Temporary Protection
Even if the copy protection software is allowed to auto-
run, there is a period of time, between when a protected
disc is inserted and when the active protection software
is installed, when the music is vulnerable to copying. It
would be possible to have the discs immediately and au-
tomatically install the active protection software, mini-
mizing this window of vulnerability, but legal and ethical
requirements should preclude this option. Installing soft-
ware without ﬁrst obtaining the user’s consent appears
to be illegal in the U.S. under the Computer Fraud and
Abuse Act (CFAA) as well as various state anti-spyware
laws [2, 3].
Software vendors conventionally obtain user consent
to the installation of their software by displaying an End
User License Agreement (EULA) and asking the user to
accept it. Only after the user agrees to the EULA is the
software installed. The EULA informs the user, in theory
at least, of the general scope and purpose of the software
being installed, and the user has the option to withhold
consent by declining the EULA, in which case no soft-
ware is installed. As we will see below, the DRM ven-
dors do not always follow this procedure.
If the discs didn’t use any other protection measures,
the music would be vulnerable to copying while the in-
staller waited for the user to accept or reject the EULA.
Users could just ignore the installer’s EULA window
and switch tasks to a CD ripping or copying application.
Both XCP and MediaMax employ temporary protection
mechanisms to protect the music during this time.
4.2.1 XCP Temporary Protection
The ﬁrst time an XCP-protected disc is inserted into
a Windows machine,
the Windows autorun feature
launches the XCP installer, the ﬁle go.exe located in
the contents folder on the CD. The installer displays
a license agreement and prompts the user to accept or de-
cline it. If the user accepts the agreement, the installer
installs the XCP active protection software onto the ma-
chine; if the user declines, the installer exits after eject-
ing the CD, preventing other applications from ripping or
copying it.
While the EULA is being displayed, the XCP installer
continuously monitors the list of processes running on
the system. It compares the image name of each process
to a blacklist of nearly 200 ripping and copying appli-
cations hard coded into the go.exe program. If one or
more blacklisted applications are running, the installer re-
places the EULA display with a warning indicating that
the applications need to be closed in order for the installa-
tion to continue. It also initiates a 30-second countdown
timer; if any of the applications are still running when
the countdown reaches zero, the installer ejects the CD
and quits.3
This technique might prevent some unsophisticated
users from copying the disc while the installer is running,
but it can be bypassed with a number of widely known
techniques. For instance, users might kill the installer
process (using the Windows Task Manager) before it can
eject the CD, or they might use a ripping or copying ap-

plication that locks the CD tray, preventing the installer
from ejecting the disc.
The greatest limitation of the XCP temporary protec-
tion system is the blacklist. Users might ﬁnd ripping or
copying applications that are not on the list, or they might
use a blacklisted application but rename its executable
ﬁle to prevent the installer from recognizing it. Since
there is no mechanism for updating the blacklist on ex-
isting CDs, they will gradually become easier to rip and
copy as new applications not on the blacklist come into
widespread use. Application developers may also adapt
their software to the blacklisting technique by randomiz-
ing their process image names or taking other measures
to avoid detection.4
4.2.2 MediaMax Temporary Protection
MediaMax employs a different—and highly controver-
sial—temporary protection measure. It defends the mu-
sic while the installer is running by installing, and at least
temporarily activating, the active protection software be-
fore displaying the EULA. The software is installed with-
out obtaining consent, and it remains installed (and in
some cases, permanently active) even if the user explic-
itly denies consent by declining the license agreement.
MediaMax discs install the active protection driver by
copying a ﬁle called sbcphid.sys to the Windows
drivers directory, conﬁguring it as a service in the reg-
istry, and launching it. Initially, the driver’s startup type
is set to “Manual,” so it will not re-launch the next time
the computer boots; however, it remains running until
the computer is shut down, and it remains installed per-
manently [11]. Albums that use MediaMax version 5
additionally install components of the MediaMax player
software before displaying a license agreement. These
ﬁles are not removed if the EULA is declined.
Even more troublingly, under some common circum-
stances—for example, if the user inserts a MediaMax
version 5 CD and declines the EULA and later inserts a
MediaMax CD again—the MediaMax installer will per-
manently activate the active protection software (by set-
ting its startup type to “Auto,” which causes it to be
launched every time the computer boots). This behav-
ior is related to a mechanism in the installer apparently
intended to upgrade the active protection software if an
older version is already installed.
We can think of two possible explanations for this be-
havior. Perhaps the vendor, SunnComm, did not test
these scenarios to determine what their software did, and
so did not realize that they were activating the software
without consent. Or perhaps they did know what would
happen in these cases and deliberately chose these behav-
iors. Either possibility is troubling, indicating either a
deﬁcient design and testing procedure or a deliberate de-
cision to install software after the user denied permission
to do so.
Even if poor testing is the explanation for activating
the software without consent, it is clear that SunnComm
deliberately chose to install the MediaMax software on
the user’s system even if the user did not consent. These
decisions are difﬁcult to reconcile with the ethical and le-
gal requirements on software companies. But they are
easy to reconcile with the vendor’s platform building
strategy, which rewards the vendor for placing its soft-
ware on as many computers as possible.
Even if no software is installed without consent, the
temporary activation of DRM software, by both XCP
and MediaMax, before the user consents to anything
raises troubling ethical questions.
It is hard to argue
that the user has consented to loading running software
merely by the act of inserting the disc. Most users do not
expect the insertion of a music CD to load software, and
although many (but not all) of the affected discs did con-
tain a statement about protection software being on the
discs, the statements generally were confusingly worded,
were written in tiny print, and did not say explicitly that
software would install or run immediately upon insertion
of the disc. Some in the record industry argue that the
industry’s desire to block potential infringement justiﬁes
the short-term execution of the temporary protection soft-
ware on every user’s computer. We think this issue de-
serves more ethical and legal debate.
4.3 Passive Protection
Another way to prevent copying before active protection
software is installed is to use passive protection mea-
sures. Passive protection exploits subtle differences be-
tween the way computers read CDs and the way ordi-
nary CD players do. By changing the layout of data
on the CD, it is sometimes possible to confuse comput-
ers without affecting ordinary players. In practice, the
distinction between computers and CD players is impre-
cise. Older generations of CD copy protection, which
relied entirely on passive protection, proved easy to copy
in some computers and impossible to play on some CD
players [10]. Furthermore, computer hardware and soft-
ware has tended to get better at reading the passive pro-
tected CDs over time as it has become more robust to all
manner of damaged or poorly formatted discs. For these
reasons, more recent CD DRM schemes rely mainly on
active protection.
XCP uses a mild variety of passive protection as an
added layer of security against ripping and copying. This
form of passive protection exploits a quirk in the way
Windows handles multisession CDs. When CD burners
came to market in the early 1990s, the multisession CD
format was introduced to allow data to be appended to

partially recorded discs. (This was especially desirable
at a time when recordable CD media cost tens of dollars
per disc.) Each time data is added to the disc, it is written
as an independent series of tracks called a session. Multi-
session compatible CD drives see all the sessions, but
ordinary CD players, which generally do not support the
multisession format, recognize only the ﬁrst session.
Some commercial discs use a variant of the multises-
sion format to combine CD audio and computer accessi-
ble ﬁles on a single CD. These discs adhere to the Blue
Book or “stamped multisession” format. According to
the Blue Book speciﬁcation, stamped multisession discs
must contain two sessions: a ﬁrst session with 1–99 CD
audio tracks, and a second session with one data track.
The Windows CD audio driver contains special support
for Blue Book discs. It presents the CD to player and
ripper applications as if it were a normal audio CD. Win-
dows treats other multisession discs as data-only CDs.
XCP discs deviate from the Blue Book format by
adding a second data track in the second session. This
causes Windows to treat the disc as a regular multises-
sion data CD, so the primary data track is mounted as a
ﬁle system, but the audio tracks are invisible to player
and ripper applications that use the Windows audio CD
driver. This includes Windows Media Player, iTunes, and
most other widely used CD applications. We developed a
procedure for creating discs with this passive protection
using only standard CD burning hardware and software.
This variety of passive protection provides only lim-
ited resistance to ripping and copying. There are a num-
ber of well-known methods for defeating it:
• Advanced ripping and copying applications avoid
the Windows CD audio driver altogether and issue
commands directly to the drive. This allows pro-
grams such as Nero and Exact Audio Copy to rec-
ognize and read all the audio tracks.
• Non-Windows platforms,
including MacOS and
Linux, read multisession CDs more robustly and do
not suffer from the limitation that causes ripping
problems on Windows.
• The felt-tip marker trick, described above, can also
defeat this kind of passive protection. When the sec-
ond session is obscured by the marker, CD drives
see only the ﬁrst session and treat the disc as a regu-
lar audio CD, which can be ripped or copied.
5 Disc Recognition
To accomplish this, the schemes install a background
process that interposes itself between applications and
the original CD driver. In MediaMax, this process is a
kernel-mode driver called sbcphid.sys. XCP uses a
pair of ﬁlter drivers called crater.sys and cor.sys
that attach to the CD-ROM and IDE devices [21]. In both
schemes, the active protection drivers examine each disc
that is inserted into the computer to see whether access
to it should be restricted.
If the disc is recognized as
copy protected, the drivers monitor for attempts to read
the audio tracks, as would occur during a playback, rip,
or disc copy operation, and corrupt the audio returned by
the drive to degrade the listening experience. MediaMax
introduces a large amount of random jitter, making the
disc sound like it has been badly scratched or damaged;
XCP replaces the audio with random noise.
Each scheme’s active protection software interferes
with attempts to rip or copy any disc that is protected
by the same scheme, not merely the disc from which
the software was installed. This requires some mecha-
nism for identifying discs that are to be protected. In this
section we discuss the security requirements for such a
recognition system, and describe the design and limita-
tions of the actual recognition mechanism employed by
the MediaMax scheme.
5.1 Recognition Requirements
Any disc recognition system detects some distinctive fea-
ture of discs protected by a particular copy protection
scheme. Ideally such a feature would satisfy four require-
ments: it would uniquely identify protected discs with-
out accidentally triggering the copy protection on other
titles; it would be detectable quickly after reading a lim-
ited amount of audio from the disc; it would be indelible
enough that an attacker could not remove it without sig-
