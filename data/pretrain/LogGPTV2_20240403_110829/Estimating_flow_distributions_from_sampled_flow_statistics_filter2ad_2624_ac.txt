Although there is no generally agreed standard for the necessary
accuracy of length distributions, we expect the accuracy to within
1% will be sufﬁcient for many applications.
3.3 TCP Speciﬁc Assumptions
We now examine the assumption of Section 2.4 that TCP ﬂows
contain one SYN packet. First: how frequently do TCP ﬂows con-
tain at least one SYN packet? The answer depends on the ﬂow deﬁ-
nition: a short interpacket timeout may split a TCP connection into
several ﬂows, not all of which contain a SYN packet. We ﬁnd some
indication in the FLOW dataset, where we found that 84% of TCP
ﬂows were SYN ﬂows; similar proportions were found in other
ﬂow traces. Investigating the same question using packet traces is
problematic, since initial SYN packets will not be measured from
ﬂows already in progress when trace collection starts.
Second: how frequently do TCP ﬂows contain at most one packet?
In the packet traces we determined the proportion of those TCP
ﬂows containing at least one SYN packet, that contained exactly
one SYN packet. For CAMPUS, it was 98.8%; in PEERING 94.6%.
A single SYN packet in an original TCP ﬂow is expected to be
the ﬁrst packet of the ﬂow. However, our method is insensitive to
the position of the SYN packet in the ﬂow, since the probability to
sample a single packet is assumed independent of its position.
3.4 Sampling, Components and Nonadditivity
As discussed further in Section 8, trace COS contains packets
generated by hosts infected by the Slammer worm. These are man-
ifested as (overwhelmingly) single packet ﬂows. The impact on
the original ﬂow length distribution can be seen in Figure 2, which
shows the ﬂow length distribution of the original trafﬁc, complete,
and with worm packets excluded (upper two curves). The two
curves are practically identical except for ﬂows of length 1.
The lower two curves in Figure 2 show the sampled ﬂow length
frequencies for independent sampling with period 1, 000. The con-
tribution of the work trafﬁc is barely visible at the scale of the ag-
gregate. This reiterates the example of Section 1.1 where we saw
that sampled ﬂow length distributions alone does not contain sufﬁ-
cient information to infer all details of the original distribution.
The motivates making maximal use of the information that is
present in the ﬂows, or otherwise available. Since different ap-
plications are not expected to exhibit the same ﬂow length distri-
butions, trafﬁc may be segmented into classes of interest, e.g. by
TCP/UDP port number. Both inference techniques presented in this
paper (scaling with enhanced smoothing, and th EM-method) gen-
erally produced estimates that are non-additive in the sampled fre-
quencies. Hence segmentation will reduced cross-contamination of
estimates between applications, and potentially increase accuracy.
As an example, we identify worm trafﬁc by a combination of port
number and packet length, and analyze it separately in Section 8.
Finally, Figure 2 illustrates another point. It is sometimes thought
that the original ﬂow length distribution can be recovered exclu-
sively by scaling and extrapolating the sampled ﬂow length distri-
bution. This would amount to translating the sampled frequencies
curve within the ﬁgure. This example shows that no such transla-
tion would yield a convincing overlap with the curve of the original
frequencies.
4. SCALING-BASED INFERENCE & TCP
Our starting point the simple scaling model described in the in-
troduction: an original ﬂow of length N k is attributed to each sam-
pled ﬂow of length k. To overcome the limitations described in the
introduction, we apply a smoothing to this simple distribution, and
use reported TCP ﬂags to draw inferences about ﬂows for which no
packet was sampled. Thus this method is limited to inferring char-
acteristics of TCP ﬂows, and assumes the TCP ﬂags are reported in
the ﬂow statistics, in the manner of NetFlow.
For a single ﬂow the scaling idea can be made rigorous through
Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation. The idea of ML-estimation
is that we are given a family of statistical models each member of
which is speciﬁed by a parameter value θ. The actual parameter
value is to be estimated from measured data X. For each pos-
sible parameter θ, the model speciﬁes the probability Pθ[X] that
the measured data would be obtained. The maximum likelihood
estimator (MLE) (cid:5)θ is the value which maximizes this probability:
(cid:5)θ = arg max Pθ[X]. Maximum likelihood estimators enjoy some
useful general properties: they are consistent (they converge to the
true value as the amount of data grows) and they are efﬁcient (they
have minimal asymptotic variance in the same limit).
4.1 Inference of a Single Flow Length
Sampling the packets of an individual ﬂow of length (cid:2) with prob-
ability p should yield a ﬂow of average length (cid:2)p, ignoring splitting.
This suggests an inversion based on dividing measured ﬂow lengths
by p. The following lemma partially justiﬁes this approach.
Lemma 1. Consider (cid:2) objects, sampled independently with prob-
ability p  1 we can
smooth this weight over an (integer) interval of width N with (cid:2)j as
close to its center as possible. This can be done while satisfying the
conservation law that the average number sampled SYN ﬂows and
sampled packets are equal to gSYN
and j respectively.
j
j
The case j = 1 is different. This corresponds to original ﬂows
comprising a single SYN packet, and so the number of sampled
non-SYN packets is zero. The only smoothing of the weight of
N gSYN
1 ﬂows that conserves average ﬂow length is that which con-
centrates all the weight at length 1. But this is undesirable, since
it leaves a gap in the estimated distribution for which there is no
particular justiﬁcation in the data.

Clearly we need to extract more information from the gSYN
in
order to better distribute the weight from gSYN
1 . Our strategy here
is motivated by the expectation that the dominant contributions to
gSYN
2 will be from shorter ﬂows. To see this, assume the

extreme case that original ﬂows all have length L. Then E[gSYN

−2(1−1/N )L−2,

To smooth the dominant weight, we use a more detailed argu-
ment. The aim is to jointly smooth the weights of gSYN
2 uni-
formly over integer intervals I1 = [1, t] and I2 = (t,(cid:9)3N/2(cid:10)] re-
spectively, i.e., the weights at points in the two intervals are h1(t) =
2 /((cid:9)3N/2(cid:10) − t) respectively. (Since
N gSYN
higher integer multiples of N are chosen to be at or near midpoints
of intervals of with N, the upper boundary (cid:9)3N/2(cid:10) of I2 lies adja-
cent to the lower boundary of the interval containing the mass from
j = 3). Our task is to choose t.

Using the smoothings described above for a given choice of t,
the expected number of sampled ﬂows with lengths i = 1 or 2 that
are generated by original ﬂows with lengths in I1 ∪ I2 are

From the foregoing discussion, we expect the dominant contribu-
tions to gSYN
to originate in from shorter ﬂows. This mo-
tivates us to chose t such that the ratio G1(t)/G2(t) is close to
gSYN
1 /gSYN
2 . Since t is an integer variable, we cannot expect the ra-
tios to be equal for some t. Instead, we look for

Finally, we also wish to avoid having t too high; otherwise we run
the risk of unduly favoring larger original ﬂow lengths in our esti-
mator, without strong evidence that we should. One measure of the
accuracy of the inferred distribution is comparison of the average
predicted length with the estimator L(1). A detailed argument that
we do not reproduce here shows that further restricting t above en-
ables us to bound the mean length according to the inferred distri-
bution to within a small multiple of L(1). In this paper, we restrict t
