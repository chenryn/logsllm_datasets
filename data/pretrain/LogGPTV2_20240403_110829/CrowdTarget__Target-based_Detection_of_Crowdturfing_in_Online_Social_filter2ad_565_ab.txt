vinced that workers of collusion-based crowdturﬁng services
are either real humans or advanced human-like bots. Un-
like casual bots, the crowdturﬁng workers are more popular
than normal accounts and do not have synchronized group
activities. Therefore, the conventional bot detectors cannot
detect the crowdturﬁng accounts.
3. DATA COLLECTION
In this section, we explain our ground-truth tweets col-
lected from three sources: Twitter, crowdturﬁng sites, and
black-market sites. We only consider tweets that received
≥ 50 retweets because a small number of retweets cannot
manipulate the popularity of accounts. Note that every
black-market site analyzed assures ≥ 50 retweets, so this
treatment is acceptable. Also, every tweet we collected was
created between November 2014 and February 2015. Table 1
summarizes our dataset.
3.1 Ground-truth Tweets
Normal tweets on Twitter. We collected normal tweets
from Twitter. We regarded a tweet as a normal tweet if it
was created by a veriﬁed Twitter account that has ≥ 100,000
followers. We randomly selected 1,044 veriﬁed Twitter ac-
counts that satisfy the requirements and monitored their
timeline to collect tweets and retweets.
Crowdturﬁng tweets. We collected crowdturﬁng tweets
from nine diﬀerent crowdturﬁng sites. We registered at the
crowdturﬁng sites and retrieved tasks requesting retweets
posted on the sites.
Black-market tweets. We collected black-market tweets
from ﬁve diﬀerent black-market sites, e.g., retweets.pro [4]
and socialshop.co [5]. We ﬁrst wrote 282 tweets containing
URLs by using our fake Twitter accounts. Then, we regis-
tered at the black-market sites and purchased retweets for
our tweets. On average, we paid $5.6 for 100 retweets and
$13.4 for 1,000 retweets. All black-market sites provided the
retweets about a day.
3.2 Methods to Collect Retweets
We explain our approach to collect retweets. Although
Twitter provides a REST API to retrieve retweets that a
tweet received (statuses/retweets), this API only returns
up to 100 latest retweets. Our objective is to collect as
many retweets for each target tweet as possible. We take two
approaches to achieve it. First, for a target tweet recently
posted, we use a streaming API to monitor retweets it will
receive in the next three days. Second, for a target tweet
posted in the past, we use a Twitter search function to ﬁnd
as many retweets of the target tweet as possible.
3.3 Ethics
In this study, we have encountered several legal and eth-
ical problems on experimenting and collecting data. We
referenced Thomas et al. [25]’s approach to ethically study
underground services. We designed our data collection and
subsequent experiments to follow the exemption guideline
from a formal review of the institutional review board (IRB)
of our institute.
First, we have not collected any data that can be used
to distinguish individual subjects. We deleted detailed per-
sonal information (e.g., names and proﬁles) that were unre-
lated to our experiments.
Second, to minimize our eﬀects to underground services,
we only retrieved public tasks posted on crowdturﬁng sites
and purchased a small number of retweets from black-market
sites. Further, we neither attempted to inspect who operate
such services nor contacted them via other channels.
Third, to avoid the negative eﬀects of using black-market
services against Twitter and its users, we deleted our fake ac-
counts right after receiving and collecting purchased retweets.
Since we made our fake accounts only follow each other and
post tweets with harmless and meaningless contents, legiti-
mate users would rarely see or retweet our tweets.
4. CROWDTURFING WORKERS
In this section, we analyze crowdturﬁng workers to know
whether they are humans, bots, or something else. We check
two sets of features: account popularity and synchronized
group activity.
4.1 Account Popularity
We compare the popularity of crowdturﬁng accounts on
Twitter with other account groups by using three features:
follower to following ratio, the number of received retweets
per tweet, and Klout score [3] (Figure 2). First, we mea-
sure the ratio of the number of followers to the number of
followings in each account group. Figure 2a shows that ap-
proximately 70% of the crowdturﬁng accounts have a larger
number of followers than followings; this ratio is much higher
than the normal (37%) and black-market account groups
(20%).
Second, we check the tweets of each account group to
know how many times they are retweeted (Figure 2b). We
observe that tweets posted by crowdturﬁng accounts are
more frequently retweeted than tweets posted by normal
or black-market account groups. Approximately 43% of

accounts have similar patterns.
counts and 4% of tweets posted by black-market accounts
are retweeted more than once.
Third, we query Klout scores of the three account groups,
which is a popular OSN inﬂuence score. Figure 2c shows that
crowdturﬁng accounts have a higher Klout score than those
of other groups. The median Klout score of the crowdturﬁng
accounts is 41. In contrast, the median Klout scores of the
normal accounts and black-market accounts are 33 and 20,
respectively.
Consequently, we are convinced that crowdturﬁng accounts
successfully boost their popularity by gaining followers and
retweets from crowdturﬁng services. They diﬀer from black-
market accounts and resemble inﬂuential users in OSNs.
4.2 Synchronized Group Activity
Next, we aim to identify whether crowdturﬁng accounts
have synchronized group activities. We use two measures to
check it: following similarity and retweet similarity.
(c) Klout score

groups: normal, crowdturﬁng, and black-market ac-
count groups. Crowdturﬁng accounts are more pop-
ular than normal and black-market accounts.
tweets posted by crowdturﬁng accounts are retweeted more
than once. In contrast, 5% of tweets posted by normal ac-

Fsim between two accounts ui and uj as follows:
Fsim(ui, uj) =
|F (ui) ∩ F (uj)|
|F (ui) ∪ F (uj)| ,
where F (ui) is a set of ui’s followings. We compute the fol-
lowing similarity between two accounts only when at least
one of their retweets originate from the same tweets. Fig-
ure 3a shows that the crowdturﬁng and normal account
groups have the same pattern:
low following similarities.
In contrast, the black-market account group has the highest
following similarity.
Retweet similarity. To compute the retweet similarity,
we ﬁrst deﬁne a set of retweets of ui, RT (ui), as follows:
RT (ui) = {(ui, T1, tid1), (ui, T2, tid2), . . . , (ui, Tn, tidn)},
where Ti represents retweet time and tidi is the ID of a
tweet retweeted by ui. A retweet (ui, Tk, tidk) in RT (ui) is
matched with another retweet (uj, Tl, tidl) in RT (uj) if they
satisfy the following two properties:
1. The two retweets are for the same tweet: tidk = tidl.
2. The two retweets are created within a threshold time
window: |Tk − Tl| ≤ Tthreshold.
Based on the deﬁnitions, we compute the retweet similar-
ity RTsim between two accounts ui and uj as follows:
RTsim(ui, uj) =
|RT (ui) ∩ RT (uj)|
|RT (ui) ∪ RT (uj)| .
Figure 3b shows the statistics of the retweet similarities
of the three account groups. We observe that the crowdturf-
ing and normal account groups have the same pattern: low
retweet similarities. In contrast, the black-market account
group has the highest retweet similarity.
Consequently, we conﬁrm that the crowdturﬁng account
group shows no or weakly synchronized group activity. Thus,
we should not rely on conventional detection methods using
synchronized group activity to detect them.
5. CROWDTURFING TARGETS
In this section, we analyze the characteristics of crowdturf-
ing targets on Twitter: tweets receiving artiﬁcial retweets
generated by crowdturﬁng workers. Note that all charac-
teristics explained in this section were never considered in
previous work and we will use all of them to build our clas-
siﬁers explained in Section 6.
5.1 Retweet Time Distribution
We ﬁrst consider the time distribution of retweets that a
tweet received. Our key insight is that the time pattern of
artiﬁcial retweets diﬀers from that of normal retweets. Fig-
ure 4 shows example retweet time distributions of normal,
crowdturﬁng, and black-market tweets. We have counted
the number of retweets generated every hour from the cre-
ation of the individual tweets. Figure 4a shows that the nor-
mal tweet is intensively retweeted within a few hours after
posting, and number of retweets decreases as time goes on.
In contrast, Figure 4b shows that the crowdturﬁng tweet
is constantly retweeted because the tweet is continuously
exposed to crowdturﬁng workers as long as it is posted on
crowdturﬁng services. In the black-market case (Figure 4c),

(b) Crowdturﬁng tweet
(c) Black-market tweet
Figure 4: Retweet time distributions of normal,
crowdturﬁng, and black-market tweets. They diﬀer
from each other.
a large number of retweets are generated within a certain
time period, and no other retweet is generated later.
To extract features from the retweet time distribution,
we use four popular measures to ﬁgure out the shape of a
distribution.
797(a) Mean
(b) Standard deviation
(c) Skewness
(d) Kurtosis
Figure 5: Statistical characteristics of retweet time distribution. The characteristics of normal, crowdturﬁng,
and black-market retweets diﬀer from each other.
5.1.1 Mean
We use the mean of a retweet time distribution to know
the average time diﬀerence between posting and retweeting.
The mean retweet time of a normal tweet is usually smaller
than that of a crowdturﬁng tweet. The mean retweet time
of a black-market tweet depends on when bots begin to op-
erate; usually, they perform retweets as soon as possible to
satisfy their customers.
Figure 5a shows the mean retweet time of the three groups.
The mean retweet time of the crowdturﬁng tweets is larger
than other groups, since they are continuously retweeted.
Also, approximately 90% of the black-market tweets, 60%
of the normal tweets, and 20% of the crowdturﬁng tweets
receive 50% of their retweets within 24 hours. Therefore, we
decide to use the mean of a retweet time distribution as a
feature.
5.1.2 Standard deviation
We use the standard deviation of a retweet time distribu-
tion to know how many retweets are generated around the
mean time. Crowdturﬁng retweets are evenly distributed
such that their standard deviation is larger than those of
normal and black-market tweets.
Figure 5b shows the standard deviation of the retweet time
distribution of the three groups. The crowdturﬁng tweets
have higher standard deviation than other groups. Further,
the smallest standard deviation of the black-market tweets
shows that most of them are retweeted around the mean
time. Therefore, we decide to use the standard deviation of
a retweet time distribution as a feature.
Skewness
5.1.3
We use the skewness of a retweet time distribution to know
when a tweet is mostly retweeted. Skewness is a measure of
the asymmetry of the distribution. Positive skewness means
that the right side tail of the distribution is longer than the
left side. In contrast, negative skewness means that the tail
on the left side is longer than the right side.
Figure 5c shows the skewness of retweet time distribu-
tions of the three groups. Most of the crowdturﬁng tweets
have near-zero skewness, which implies that they are evenly
retweeted. In contrast, the skewness of the normal tweets is
larger than zero, which implies that the number of retweets
they receive gradually decreases as time goes on. Skewness
of black-market tweets depends on how the black-market
services operate their bots. Most of the black-market tweets
collected have negative skewness, implying that the num-
798ber of retweets gradually increases at ﬁrst, but suddenly
decreases later. Thus, we decide to use the skewness of a
retweet time distribution as a feature.
5.1.4 Kurtosis
We use the kurtosis of a retweet time distribution to know
the intensity of retweets within a short time period. Kur-
tosis is a measure of the peakedness of the distribution. If
a distribution is sharper than the normal distribution, its
kurtosis is positive. In contrast, if a distribution is ﬂatter
than the normal distribution, its kurtosis is negative. Note
that the kurtosis of the normal distribution is zero.
Figure 5d shows that the crowdturﬁng tweets have the
lowest kurtosis among the three groups, i.e., their retweets
are evenly distributed. The kurtosis of the normal tweets
is much higher than that of the crowdturﬁng tweets be-
cause, usually, a normal retweet time distribution has a peak
around the posting time. The black-market tweets have the
highest kurtosis because black-market services should gener-
ate a number of retweets within a given deadline [11]. Con-
sequently, we decide to use the kurtosis of a retweet time
distribution as a feature.
