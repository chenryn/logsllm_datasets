User: In the "Memcache Viewer", is there any way to dump a list of existing keys? Just for debugging, of course, not for use in any scripts!
I ask because it doesn't seem like the GAE SDK is using a "real" memcache server, so I'm guessing it's emulated in Python (for simplicity, as it's just a development server).. This would mean there is a dict somewhere with the keys/values..
Assistant: Memcache is designed to be quick and there's no convincing use case for this functionality
which would justify the overhead required for a command that is so at odds with the rest of memcached.
The GAE SDK is simulating memcached, so it doesn't offer this functionality either.
