User: All seemed to be working fine in my anaconda distribution on Mac. Then I tried to install the postgres library psycopg2 with conda install psycopg2. That threw an error. Something about permissions. But now nothing works. Now it can't even find the conda executable or start ipython. 
-bash: conda: command not found
Should condo executable be in ~/ananconda/bin.
The directory is there but no conda executable. 
Anyone know what might have happened or how I can recover from this?
Assistant: You're going to have to reinstall Anaconda to fix this. Without conda, there's not much you can do to clean up the broken install.
