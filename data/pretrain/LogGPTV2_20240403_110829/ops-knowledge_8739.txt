User: How to configure a reverse proxy through Nginx to distribute traffic between multiple application servers?
Assistant: To configure a reverse proxy through Nginx to distribute traffic between multiple application servers, you can follow the steps below: 1. Install Nginx: If you have not installed Nginx, you can install it on Ubuntu with the following command: ``` sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install nginx ``` 2. Modify the Nginx configuration file: We need to forward the request traffic to multiple application servers through Nginx. Open the default configuration file `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default` or create a new configuration file and add the following: ``` upstream backend { server 10.10.10.1:8080; server 10.10.10.2:8080; } server { listen 80; server_name example.com; location / { proxy_pass http://backend; } } ``` In the above configuration, the `upstream` block defines the addresses and ports of multiple application servers. The `server` block defines the port and domain name that Nginx listens on, and where requests are forwarded. The `proxy_pass` directive is used to forward requests to one of the list of application servers defined by `backend`. 3. Reload the Nginx configuration: After modifying the configuration file, you need to reload Nginx for the changes to take effect. Run the following command: ``` sudo service nginx reload ``` Now, through the reverse proxy configured by Nginx, requests from clients will be distributed to multiple application servers according to the defined load balancing algorithm.
