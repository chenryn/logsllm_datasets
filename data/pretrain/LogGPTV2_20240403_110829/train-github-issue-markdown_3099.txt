 **Apache Airflow version** :
2.0.0
**Kubernetes version (if you are using kubernetes)** (use `kubectl version`):
1.15.x
**Environment** :
  * **Cloud provider or hardware configuration** : AWS
**What happened** :
Apparently `removed` task state causes Airflow to consider `dag_run` as
active, due to `removed` not being part of `finished` frozenset:
https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/v2-0-stable/airflow/utils/state.py#L103
**What you expected to happen** :
Removed state is counted as finished
**How to reproduce it** :
Create a dag run, backfill with success (-m) and then deploy a change removing
some tasks. Airflow will now count it as active
