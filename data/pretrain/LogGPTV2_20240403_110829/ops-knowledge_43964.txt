User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Change the default SCP command flags in Linux I am trying to move a file from a virtual machine (Ubuntu 18.04) on my local system to a remote server using a very basic scp command. This issue is present only on one particular server, others work fine so it is not a generic thing.

scp &lt;file name&gt; &lt;user&gt;@&lt;complete_hostname&gt;:~/


But this command does not proceed beyond authentication which is successful.

Same happens when I use FileZilla.

The IT team advised me to use 'WinSCP' which works fine. 

scp debug log 

debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic,password
debug1: Trying private key: /home/username/.ssh/id_dsa
debug1: Trying private key: /home/username/.ssh/id_ecdsa
debug1: Next authentication method: password
'user'@'full hostname's password: 
debug1: Authentication succeeded (password).
debug1: channel 0: new [client-session]
debug1: Requesting no-more-sessions@openssh.com
debug1: Entering interactive session.
debug1: Sending environment.
debug1: Sending env LANG = C
debug1: Sending env LC_ALL = C
debug1: Sending command: scp -v -t ~/


There is no progress after this, FileZilla times out after 20 seconds in similar fashion. while WinSCP works fine.

What can cause scp to hang, as I am using this in some of my scripts, this issue with one particular server has made my scripts unusable on them, this applies to SFTP methods also.

The IT Team advised me to not use the flags -d and -t while issuing the command as the same shows up on the debug log and is not supported by the remote server. Can these be removed? I did not explicitly issue them with the command.

Edit 2:

-t - That's a total nonsense. SCP protocol cannot work without the -t flag. See How is SCP (secure copy protocol) file transfer working?

-d - It's used, when you specify more than one source. It indicates to the server that the "target should be directory".

In both cases I doubt that the server does not support any of them. As it's Ubuntu, it's running OpenSSH with 99.9% certainty. And OpenSSH supports those flags ever since it exists. See scp.c from 1999.



I'm pretty sure that the advice you got is just a nonsense. The "IT team" probably just didn't found those switches in scp man page and got an easy way out of really helping you. But those flags are internal flags used for communicating between scp as a "client" and scp as a "server". They are not documented by purpose.

Also FileZilla does not even support SCP protocol. What only contributes to the above - Your problem has nothing to do with any "scp flags".
