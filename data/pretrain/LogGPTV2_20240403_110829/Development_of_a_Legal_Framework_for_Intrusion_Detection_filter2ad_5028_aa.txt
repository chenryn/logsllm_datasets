Abstract.  To  meet  demands  for  increased  interconnectivity,  efficiency  or
competitiveness,  organizations  increasingly  rely  on  technology.    This  trend
creates significant opportunities to improve  service  delivery  and  to  move  into
new areas of endeavour.  But reliance on an inherently insecure infrastructure
exposes  organizations  to  a  constantly  evolving  threat  environment.    Not  only
has  the  nature  of  the  threat  changed,  so  too  has  the  scope  of  the  protection
problem.    Protection  of  information  systems  is  now  seen  as  a  component  of
national  security.    As  organizational  assets  move  online,  so  does  the  threat.
Key sources of threat information are now online, including within the network
communications themselves.  This puts organizations in a position where they
must  monitor  network  communications  in  order  to  obtain  intelligence,
indications  and  warnings  of  intrusions  and  evidence  to  support  criminal
prosecution  as  appropriate.    One  method  of  performing  this  monitoring  is
through  the  use  of  intrusion  detection  systems  (IDS).    However,  this  may
involve the monitoring of private communications, which introduces a number
of  legal  (privacy  and  criminal  law)  concerns.    While  existing  legislation
adequately addresses interception by S&I and law enforcement agencies, they
generally  fail  to  address  interception  of  network  traffic  by  other  public  or
private sector organizations.  This paper seeks to identify and discuss some of
the key legal issues affecting the development of a general legal framework for
intrusion detection for network protection.

1   Introduction
Organizations  of  all  types,  in  both  the  public  and  private  sectors,  are  increasingly
dependent  on  information  technology.    This  dependency  results  from  demands  for
increased  interconnectivity,  efficiency  or  competitiveness  –  on  the  part  of  the
organizations themselves and/or their clients.  These organizations have increasingly

been turning to information system technology for a variety of purposes: e-commerce,
e-government,  and  improvements  in  information  access  and  sharing  among  others.
Reliance on an inherently insecure infrastructure exposes organizations to a variety of
new threats.  They must now contend with new cyber-threats such as fast-spreading
malicious code and criminal hacking.
The scope of the protection problem has also dramatically increased over the past
few years.  Protection of computer systems and networks has been an issue of concern
for some time.  In the last few years, however, the protection of these same systems
and networks has come to be viewed as a component of national security.  This is due
in  large  part  to  the  work  of  the  President’s  Commission  on  Critical  Infrastructure
Protection  (PCCIP),  which  broadened  the  definition  of  national  security  to  include
protection of critical infrastructures1, one of which is the telecommunications sector.
Arguably, the telecommunications sector is the most important of the sectors, as all of
the  others  are  dependent  in  some  way  or  another  (many  of  which  may  not  be  well
understood) on telecommunications.
Traditionally,  the  emphasis  of  the  protection  effort  has  been  on  the  use  of
cryptography, firewalls, anti-virus applications and so on.  Although this is still very
important,  greater  emphasis  is  being  placed  on  detection  of  and  response  to
anomalous events – in recognition of the fact that perfect protection is impossible to
achieve.  A key element of this strategy is the use of intrusion detection systems IDS),
which  examine  network  or  host  activity  to  detect  indications  of  malicious  activity.
However, this may involve the interception of personal or private information, which
introduces a number of legal (privacy and criminal law) concerns.
2   Aim
The ability to copy, save and/or log personal information transmitted over a network
exists in technologies that  are  already  in  widespread use,  such  as  firewalls,  servers,
and  anti-virus  software.  Indeed,  logging  of  personal  information  is  a  far  easier
proposition in the context of these network infrastructure and security administration
tools.  The implications of criminal and anti-terrorism legislation are thus not limited
to IDS alone, however, this paper will focus on their application to intrusion detection
systems.
It  is  the  intent  of  this  paper  to  examine  key  provisions  of  criminal  and  anti-
terrorism  legislation,  and  examine  some  of  the  implications  for  the  use  of  IDS  in
protecting  computers  and  networks.    Reference  will  be  made  to  legislation  from
Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States in order to demonstrate
that these are issues of general interest. It is not the intent of this paper to substitute

incapacitation  or  destruction  would  have  a  debilitating  impact  on  defense  or  economic
security.”  Anonymous,  “Critical  Foundations:  Protecting  America’s  Infrastructures”,  The
President’s  Commission  on  Critical  Infrastructure  Protection,  October  1997,  page  19.
Although  the  actual  delineation  of  these  infrastructures  varies  somewhat  from  country  to
country,  it  is  generally  agreed  that  critical  infrastructures  include  energy,  banking  and
finance,  transportation,  water  and  sewage,  government  services,  emergency  services  and
telecommunications.

3   Interception Requirements
The  manner  in  which  public  and  private  sector  organizations  conduct  business  and
offer services to their clients has changed dramatically over the past several years, as
organizations move to e-business, e-government or any other form of online activity.
An increasing percentage of organizational assets are moving online, stored in file and
mail  servers,  data  warehouses  and  storage  area  networks.    These  assets  include
financial,  medical  or  personnel  records,  strategic  plans,  and  trade  secrets  –  all  of
which represent some of the organization’s most valuable assets.  Similarly, business
communications are increasingly carried by networks of one form or another.
Individuals  and  organizations  that  pose  a  threat  to  these  assets  are  also  moving
online.  This is partly because this is “where the money is”.  It is also partly because
the  use  of  these  technologies  confers  flexibility,  speed  and  anonymity  on  their
activities.    Cyber-threats  are  difficult  to  anticipate  (other  than  in  a  generic  way),
detect, verify and trace. As the threat is increasingly cyber-based, information about
the  threat  can  also  be  found  online.    Hacker  websites,  e-zines,  Internet  Relay  Chat
channels and e-mail can be important sources of threat information, as is the network
traffic  itself.    A  number  of  functions  performed  by  public  and  private  sector
organizations  depend  upon  access  to  and  analysis  of  that  information,  including
intelligence, evidence, and indications and warnings to name a few.
Intelligence is defined as information and knowledge about an adversary obtained
through  observation,  investigation,  analysis,  or  understanding.  2    The  collection,
analysis and reporting of timely, accurate intelligence on threats to national security is
generally  the  responsibility  of  security  and  intelligence  (S&I)  agencies  such  as  the
National  Security  Agency  (NSA)  or  the  Central  Intelligence  Agency  (CIA).3    The
intelligence function is no longer the exclusive domain of ‘national security’ agencies
–  private  sector  organizations  need  to  generate  competitive  business  intelligence.
They may also receive intelligence from law enforcement and S&I agencies under the
auspices of programs such as the FBI’s Infragard)4.

Intelligence includes identifying and monitoring groups or individuals  deemed  to
pose a national  security  threat.   Intelligence  may  be gathered  in  a number  of  ways,
ranging  from  sophisticated  technical  means  (e.g.  satellites  and  signals  intelligence
efforts) to human intelligence sources (e.g. spies, defectors and informants).  In order
to  fulfill  their  mandates,  these  agencies  now  undoubtedly  include  intercept  and
analysis  (of  both  traffic  and  content)  of  open  (i.e.  public)  information  sources  and
network  traffic  as  sources  of  intelligence  about  both  conventional  and  cyber-based
threat activity.5
Technological  advances  and  the  Internet  provide  expanded  opportunities  for
criminal  activity. As  a  result,  law  enforcement  agencies  face  many  new  challenges,
notably  building  the  knowledge  and  skills  necessary  to  effectively  combat  cyber
crimes.    Part  of  this  knowledge  may  derive  from  an  examination  of  open  sources,
including  intercept  and  examination  of  network  communications  as  a  source  of
criminal intelligence.  Interception activity is also undertaken to collect evidence of an
(criminal) offense to support prosecution efforts.6  The use of cyber-based evidence is
becoming  more  important,  and  there  is  no  reason  to  suppose  that  law  enforcement
agencies would not consider IDS logs as a potential source of cyber-based evidence.7
While  the  collection  of  evidence  to  support  criminal  prosecution  has  traditionally
been a law enforcement responsibility, S&I agencies are increasingly being tasked to
support  law  enforcement  in  this  regard,  particularly  in  support  of  anti-terrorism
efforts.8
Specific  legislation  exists  to  govern  interception  activities  of  S&I  and  law
enforcement  agencies.    A number  of  conditions  must  be  met  before  an  interception
authorization  can  be  granted,  and  certain  conditions  must  be  also  be  met  while
conducting  the  interception.    These  conditions  may  be  spelled  out  in  the  relevant

communications  (ECHELON  interception  system)  (2001/2098(INI)),  report  reference  A5-
0264/2001, dated 11 July 2001.  The report refers to claims that ECHELON has ‘the ability
to intercept any telephone, fax, Internet or e-mail message sent by any individual and thus to
inspect  its  contents’  (Section  1.6,  page  23)  while  acknowledging  that  limitations  on
interception  and  analysis  make  this  kind  of  global  surveillance  ‘impossible  in  practice’
(Preamble, page 11, Item D).

June 2002.  In this case, FBI review of network audit and monitoring logs revealed that al
Qaeda  operatives  were  spending  time  on  sites  dealing  with  supervisory  control  and  data
acquisition  (SCADA)  systems  –  the  systems  that  control  power,  water,  transport  and
communications  grids.    See  also:  Pruitt,  S.,  IDG  News  Service,  “FBI  gets  new  Web

7 While the admissibility of electronic records has been the subject of past case law, it is not
clear  if  IDS  logs  have  been  included.    For  issues  associated  with  the  use  of  IDS  logs  as
evidence, see: Sommers, P., “Intrusion Detection Systems as Evidence”, First International

governing  legislation  (e.g.  CSIS  Act)  or  other  legislation  (e.g.  criminal  or  anti-
terrorism law).9 
Other public and private sector organizations also have a requirement to intercept
and  examine  network  traffic.    While  these  organizations  may  need  to  do  this  for
intelligence  or  evidentiary  purposes,  most  such  interception  would  likely  be
conducted by law enforcement or S&I agencies.  Instead, interception performed by
these organizations is more commonly done in order to identify an attempted or actual
intrusion  into  a  protected  system  or  network,  and  to  initiate  an  incident  response
process  (of  course,  this  also  applies  to  law  enforcement  and  S&I  agencies).    While
existing legal regimes adequately address  interception by  S&I  and  law  enforcement
