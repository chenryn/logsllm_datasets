## Abstract
To meet the demands for increased interconnectivity, efficiency, and competitiveness, organizations are increasingly reliant on technology. This trend offers significant opportunities to enhance service delivery and explore new areas. However, it also exposes organizations to a constantly evolving threat environment. The nature and scope of these threats have changed, and protecting information systems is now considered a component of national security. As organizational assets move online, so do the threats. Key sources of threat information, including network communications, must be monitored to detect intrusions and gather evidence for potential criminal prosecution. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are a common method for this monitoring, but they may involve the interception of private communications, raising legal concerns related to privacy and criminal law. While existing legislation adequately addresses interception by security and intelligence (S&I) and law enforcement agencies, it often fails to address interception by other public or private sector organizations. This paper aims to identify and discuss key legal issues in developing a general legal framework for intrusion detection.

## 1. Introduction
Organizations in both the public and private sectors are increasingly dependent on information technology to meet demands for interconnectivity, efficiency, and competitiveness. This reliance has led to the adoption of various technologies such as e-commerce, e-government, and improved information access and sharing. However, this dependency on an inherently insecure infrastructure exposes organizations to new cyber-threats, including fast-spreading malicious code and criminal hacking.

The scope of the protection problem has expanded significantly in recent years. The protection of computer systems and networks, once a niche concern, is now seen as a critical component of national security. This shift is largely due to the work of the President’s Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection (PCCIP), which broadened the definition of national security to include the protection of critical infrastructures, particularly the telecommunications sector.

Traditionally, the focus of protection efforts has been on cryptographic methods, firewalls, and anti-virus applications. However, there is now a greater emphasis on detecting and responding to anomalous events, recognizing that perfect protection is unattainable. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are a key part of this strategy, examining network or host activity for signs of malicious activity. However, this can involve intercepting personal or private information, raising legal concerns related to privacy and criminal law.

## 2. Aim
This paper aims to examine the key provisions of criminal and anti-terrorism legislation and their implications for the use of IDS in protecting computers and networks. It will reference legislation from Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States to highlight the general interest in these issues. The opinions expressed in this paper are those of the author and do not reflect the position of the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) or the Government of Canada (GoC).

## 3. Interception Requirements
The way public and private sector organizations conduct business and offer services has changed dramatically with the shift to e-business and e-government. An increasing percentage of organizational assets, including financial, medical, and personnel records, strategic plans, and trade secrets, are moving online. Similarly, business communications are increasingly carried over networks.

Threat actors are also moving online, attracted by the flexibility, speed, and anonymity offered by these technologies. Cyber-threats are difficult to anticipate, detect, verify, and trace. As the threat landscape becomes more cyber-based, threat information can be found online, including hacker websites, e-zines, Internet Relay Chat channels, and email. Public and private sector organizations rely on this information for intelligence, evidence, and early warnings.

Intelligence, defined as information and knowledge about an adversary, is traditionally the responsibility of S&I agencies like the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). These agencies collect, analyze, and report on threats to national security. Private sector organizations also need to generate competitive business intelligence and may receive intelligence from law enforcement and S&I agencies through programs like the FBI’s Infragard.

Technological advances and the internet provide expanded opportunities for criminal activity, presenting new challenges for law enforcement agencies. These agencies may use open sources, including intercepted network communications, to gather criminal intelligence and evidence for prosecution. The use of cyber-based evidence, such as IDS logs, is becoming increasingly important.

Specific legislation governs the interception activities of S&I and law enforcement agencies, outlining the conditions under which interceptions can be authorized and conducted. However, this legislation often does not address interception by other public or private sector organizations. These organizations may need to intercept and examine network traffic to detect and respond to intrusions, but they face legal uncertainties in doing so.

In conclusion, while existing legal regimes adequately address interception by S&I and law enforcement agencies, there is a need for a broader legal framework to address the unique challenges faced by other organizations in using IDS for network protection.
