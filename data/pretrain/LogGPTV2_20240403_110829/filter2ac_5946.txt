**ATT&CK ID: M1047**
**ATT&CK Technique Name: Audit**

Administrators should conduct a comprehensive audit of all access lists and the permissions granted for web applications and services. This initial audit should cover all resources to establish a baseline. Subsequently, periodic audits should be performed on new or updated resources to ensure ongoing security. Any suspicious accounts or credentials identified during these audits should be thoroughly investigated and, if necessary, removed.
