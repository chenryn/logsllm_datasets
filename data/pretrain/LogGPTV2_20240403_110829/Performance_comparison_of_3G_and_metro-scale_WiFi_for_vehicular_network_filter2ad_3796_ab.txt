coverage is reasonably good. See Figure 2. Once again
this drive constitutes a round-trip for the same reason.
This drive was repeated 10 times to get a statistical
conﬁdence in the experimental results.

age taken from the provider [2]. Verizon coverage map for

4. MEASUREMENT RESULTS
The laptop logs per second TCP throughputs (called in-
staneous throughputs) on both the connections along with
GPS location and vehicle speed. The logs are postprocessed
to develop the following analysis.
4.1 Quality of WiFi Coverage
To determine the quality of WiFi coverage we plot the
CDF of run lengths (consecutive 1 sec segments) with zero
and non-zero throughputs seen on WiFi. See Figure 3. Note
that the 90-percentile zero throughput run length is 25 sec
and 45 sec, for the short and long drives respectively. The
same non-zero throughput numbers are 90 sec and 30 sec,
respectively. The median numbers for non-zero throughputs
are very short, however, just a few seconds. This reinforces
the general experience that there are frequent disconnections
on WiFi with vehicular mobility. However, we will note in
the next subsection that we are nevertheless able to demon-
strate impressive performance with respect to 3G.
It is important to note that this evaluation does not re-
ﬂect true AP visibility; rather it shows whether there is ac-
tual connectivity and non-zero throughput on TCP. True
AP visibility periods are likely to be longer than non-zero
TCP throughput periods as we do not use any optimized

handoﬀ technique here. The TCP is also not optimized ei-
ther except limiting the timeout period. Optimizing both of
these will likely produce a much better WiFi experience [11].
Thus, our experience could be viewed as a lower bound for
the WiFi performance.
4.2 Comparing WiFi and 3G Throughputs
In Figure 4 we compare the CDFs of instantaneous TCP
throughputs on WiFi and 3G links. The long and short
drives are shown separately. Note that WiFi throughputs
are generally better in the short drive because of better
coverage and slightly slower average driving speed experi-
enced. However, 3G throughputs are very similar. While
WiFi provides substantially better median throughput in
the short drive (roughly 2400 Kbps vs. 500 Kbps) the me-
dian throughputs are similar in the long drive. However,
WiFi has zero throughput on more occasions (roughly 25%
vs. 10% for the long drive and 42% vs. 15% for the short
drive). As noted before, this is expected as no special opti-
mized handoﬀ mechanism has been used. Also, WiFi cover-
age holes do exist (See Figures 1 and 2).
Also, notable is the fact that the 3G throughputs are well
distributed in its entire range while WiFi demonstrates ap-
proximately tri-modal distribution – zero or very low through-
put, 0-2700 Kbps, higher upto about 3300 Kbps. Depending
on the scenario each of these three modes persists for about
25%-40% of the times. The latter high throughput regions
are speciﬁcally interesting for WiFi in our context.
Now we turn our attention to relative performance dif-
ferentials between WiFi and 3G in the same time instants.
See Figure 5 that plots the CDF of the algebraic diﬀerence
between WiFi and 3G throughputs in the same time in-
stants. This plot is done only for the long drive. Note
that the fraction of times 3G performs better (45%) is only
slightly higher than the times when WiFi has zero through-
put (42%). In other words, when WiFi does have network
layer connectivity, it is very likely that WiFi demonstrates
better throughput. This again points to optimizing handoﬀ
making a serious impact.
Also, when WiFi outperforms 3G, it does it overwhelm-
ingly so. The median diﬀerence is over 1500 Kbps. On the
other hand, when 3G outperforms WiFi, the median diﬀer-
ence is roughly 500 Kbps.
We have evaluated the correlation between WiFi and 3G
throughputs for the same 1 sec intervals. The correlation is
very poor. For the short drives it is 0.03 and for the long
drive it is −0.03. This shows that these two networks can
complement each other quite well.
4.3 Correlation with Vehicle Speed
It is also interesting to ﬁnd out whether high throughputs
are speciﬁcally correlated to slow vehicular speeds. In Fig-
ure 6 we present speedwise throughput statistics by breaking
up the throughput data in the previous plot in three cate-
gories of speed – slow (0-20 Km/h), medium (20-40 Km/h)
and high (40 Km/h and up). Note that the 3G throughput
plots at diﬀerent speeds are roughly similar. They also pro-
vide similar median throughputs. But the same cannot be
claimed for WiFi, where slow speed has a clear advantage.
This is expected as the WiFi physical layer is not built to
support vehicular mobility, and the stock WiFi handoﬀ im-
plementations are not optimized for speed. The diﬀerences
are much more for the short drive. This is likely because

a better coverage better exposes the relationship between
performance and speed.
Still at the fast speed, the median WiFi throughput is
comparable to 3G for short drive. At slow speeds, it roughly
doubles (for the long drive) or quadruples (for the short
drive). WiFi is indeed impressive at slow speeds – providing
over 2500 Kbps for over 60% or 35% of the times for short
and long drives respectively. Thus, it is likely that WiFi
would be much preferred in urban roadways in rush hour
traﬃc, relative to high speed drives on rural highways. In-
cidentally, the former scenarios are likely to see metro-scale
WiFi deployments.
4.4 Correlation with Location
Here, we evaluate how throughput is correlated with lo-
cation. Previous research has indicated that WiFi signal
strength in the same location has a reasonable degree sta-
bility and this property has been utilized to develop location-
based handoﬀ techniques [9]. However, throughput stability
has not been evaluated. In regards to 3G, throughput sta-
bility has been evaluated to conclude that the entropy of
the throughput distribution reduces signiﬁcantly when con-
ditioned on location [28]. However, no direct comparison
between WiFi and 3G exists in this aspect.
For our analysis here, we use the general approach re-
ported in [28]. The idea is to use the notion of information
entropy that measures the level of uncertainty associated
