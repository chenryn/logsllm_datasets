duration T, for different values of the activation probability a. As for the success ratio, s is also an increasing func-
tion of T. Indeed, the larger the duration T, the lengthier the paths that become successful, and these very long 
paths increase the average stretch.
It is important to note that the shortest paths between two nodes in M G S
) may be much longer than the 
shortest path in the corresponding static maps, because of time-respecting paths. This is particularly true for very 
sparse temporal networks, i.e. with low activation probability. Therefore, s is always greater in temporal maps than 
in the corresponding static ones, as shown in Fig. 1, demonstrating that the activation dynamics is responsible for 
creating lengthier successful paths.
This effect is clearly visible in those data sets where ps in the static networks is low, such as the ArXiv or 
Commodities. In these networks, the large increase in the success ratio due to the activation dynamics comes with 
a large growth in the average stretch. The probability of finding much more successful tracks is increased at the 
cost of choosing longer paths. On the contrary, if ps in the static maps is high, such as for the Internet or the 
WTW, s shows a small increase in the temporal maps. These different profiles correspond to the different geome-
tricity of the considered networks. In fact, the less congruent topology and geometry are, the larger the number 
of topological traps present in 
 and the larger the potential increase in success. Temporal maps with 
limited congruency, such as ArXiv or Commodities, show the larger gains in success overcoming traps at the 
expenses of a notable increase in s, and longer durations T. On the contrary, networks with a conspicuous latent 
geometry, like the Internet and the WTW, are not characterized by a large number of topological traps, hence s 
does not rise as much.
Interestingly, different effects are obtained on the success ratio and the stretch depending on the activation 
probability. The lowest values of s are found for intermediate values of a, while ps generally increases as the activa-
tion probability decreases, down to a value for which the network becomes too inactive, and then ps becomes 
lower again. In most networks, ps remains almost unchanged if the activation probability is set equal to a = 0.3 or 
to a = 0.1 in the limit of large T, while s significantly increases if the activation decreases from a = 0.3 to a = 0.1, 
specially for the Internet and the WTW. Conversely, choosing a = 0.6, ps grows from 0.96 in the static case to 0.99 
for the Internet and from 0.99 to 0.997 in the WTW, but the stretch increases very little from s

Optimal activation probability.  Top row of Fig. 3 shows s as a function of the activation probability a, for 
several values of the network’s duration T. Interestingly, the average stretch is not a strictly decreasing function of 
a, but it reaches a minimum for some intermediate value. On the one hand, when the activation probability is very 
small, the stretch is typically large because of the lack of available active neighbors. The packet will usually remain 
1 , 
in the holding node or it will be transferred erratically, resulting in an increase of s. On the other hand, if a
 is similar to the static one, so the packet tends to fall into the same topological traps 
the topology of 
spending a long time moving in cycles (thus increasing the stretch) before it succeeds to escape the loop. 
Remarkably, the minimum of s is reached for some optimal value of the activation probability, a = aO.

However, it is important to remark that the p s/s

ones. For instance, the static value for the Internet is

bounded with a top value of 1, necessarily comes with an increase in the stretch, which can be quite limited, as for 
the Internet or the WTW, but it is unbounded.
Heterogeneous activation dynamics. 
In this section, we analyse how navigation is affected by an activa-
tion probability which varies across nodes. We do it in two different fashions: (i) constant activation probability 
a  0, the activation probability is proportional to the node’s degree so the larger the degree the more 
active is the node; if b < 0, the opposite is true, and if b = 0 we recover the case of constant activation probability. 
The average activation probability a of the whole network,  =
, varies depending on the choices of 
the coefficients b and c. We set the average activation probability a as an independent parameter, and choose c so 
bk. The constraints for the coefficient b arise from the network’s minimum and maximum degree,
