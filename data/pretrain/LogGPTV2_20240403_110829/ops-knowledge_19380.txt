User: How to configure firewall to protect system security?
Assistant: The method of configuring the firewall to protect the system security is as follows: 1. Set up a reasonable firewall policy: according to the network topology and business requirements, set the access rules and security policies for the entrance and exit to prohibit unauthorized access. 2. Filter unnecessary services: close all unnecessary services and keep only required services. This reduces the attack surface and enhances system security. 3. Enable security authentication mechanism: enable security authentication mechanism, password policy and authority control functions, and manage and monitor users and management accounts. 4. Prohibit external protocol access: Prohibit external protocol access, such as Telnet, FTP, SMTP and other plain text protocols, to enhance the security of the firewall. 5. Audit firewall logs: regularly audit firewall logs to discover any security holes and attacks in time. Tools such as intrusion detection systems (IDS) can be used to assist in identifying and analyzing intrusion events. 6. Update firewall rules: regularly update firewall rules, patch vulnerabilities and upgrade patches in time. This reduces the possibility of an attacker exploiting the vulnerability.
