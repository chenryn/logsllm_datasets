Once again, this information is available, albeit not from Oyez, should some intrepid future 
researcher find value in filling in the lacunae that remain in this initial paper.
Finally, it is important to note that the findings for the individual justices have 
differing weights. For a justice who speaks only rarely at oral argument, or a justice who is new 
to the court, even a seemingly stark pattern may not justify a strong conclusion, simply 
because there is not enough data to go on.
The Justices
This section provides an overview of the findings for each justice. The first item 
is a scorecard with a brief numerical synopsis of the justice’s record on the court. The second 
section presents analysis of the oral argument data for cases in which the justice participated.
The oral argument transcripts identify the speaker of each utterance. For the 
purposes of this analysis, no attempt was made to differentiate between utterances based on 
their nature (e.g., questions, comments, jokes, etc.): it is simply assumed that every time a 
justice speaks, it is to ask a question. Questions come in only three classes, therefore, based on 
the identity of the last party to speak: the petitioner, the respondent, or a current fellow justice 
(questions asked to justices no longer on the court were excluded15). 
Cases for which either the justices’ voting records or the advocates’ roles (i.e., 
whether they appeared for the petitioner or the respondent) were not available were excluded 
14 Compare, e.g., The Oyez Project, Altria Group v. Good , 555 U.S. ___ (2008) available at: 
(http://oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2008/2008_07_562) (last visited Saturday, May 7, 2011) with The Oyez

(last visited Saturday, May 7, 2011). 
15 In retrospect, this may have been a mistake, because it tends to understate the value of justice-to-justice 
questions for justices with greater seniority on the court. The intent behind the decision was to avoid potential 
overstatement of the value resulting from arguments or dialogs with justices no longer present.

from the analysis, because it would be impossible to link the justices’ votes with whatever they 
did at oral argument.

Discussion
The perception of Justice Kennedy as a swing vote seems supported by the fact 
that he has voted with the majority in over 87% of the 2,057 cases heard by the Supreme Court 
since his appointment: as Justice Kennedy rules, so does the court. In a 5-4 decision, of course, 
each of the five votes in the majority is equally decisive–  the changing of any would tip the 
outcome in the other direction. Justice Roberts, for example, has been with the majority in 
roughly the same percentage of the cases he has heard. The phrase “swing vote,” in the context 
of the Supreme Court, must therefore mean something more than “strongly correlated with 
the outcome of cases,” and must connote a vote that is less easy to predict on policy or 
ideological grounds.
Of the 2,057 cases heard during Justice Kennedy’s time on the court, 734 were 
included in the oral argument study (i.e., there was complete information about the justices’ 
rulings in these cases, there was complete information about who represented each party, and 
Justice Kennedy said at least one thing in the course of the oral arguments).  Over the course of 
those cases, Justice Kennedy spoke 8,753 times: 4,378 times to the petitioner, 3,837 times to the 
-8-
respondent, and 438 times to another sitting member of the court. Along with Justice Ginsburg, 
he is a very even-handed questioner, with only a very slight bias in favor of speaking to the 
petitioner. He is also the court’s most even-handed writer of special opinions, balancing 
between 51% concurrences, and 49% dissents. Most justices lean in favor of writing dissents.
This even-handedness carries through to the distribution of his questions at oral 
argument: even when the cases are grouped by the party for whom Justice Kennedy voted, no 
significant pattern emerges.
Questioning Patterns by Vote
Justice Kennedy has a slight tendency to ask more questions of the petitioner in cases where he 
votes for the respondent.16 This is not as reliable a metric with Justice Kennedy as it is with 
some other justices. For example, in Maryland v. Pringle, 540 U.S. 366 (2003), Justice Kennedy 
asked 20 questions of the petitioner and only one of the respondent, and voted for the 
petitioner. Likewise in NASA v. FLRA, 527 U.S. 229 (1999), Justice Kennedy voted for the 
respondent, having asked the respondent 19 questions and the petitioner only two.
At least at this level of analysis, Justice Kennedy remains one of the most 
inscrutable members of the court: his questioning behavior at oral argument does not 
telegraph what his vote will be.
16 This will be a recurring trend: many justices tend to ask fewer questions of the party for whom they eventually 
vote.

Discussion 
As the senior member of the court, Justice Scalia has the left the most abundant 
statistical trail. He stably in the majority (82.3%), and is a vigorous author of both dissents and 
concurrences. Like Justices Thomas, Ginsburg, Alito and Breyer, he has written more of each 
than he has majority opinions, and he is only barely in second place behind Justice Thomas 
among his fellow justices in terms of overall likelihood of submitting a written opinion in any 
given case (Justice Scalia has written  in 671 of the 2213 cases in which he has participated, for 
a rate of 42.9%).
Justice Scalia is also an enthusiastic participant in oral argument: in the 754 
arguments considered for this analysis, he spoke 17,954 times, for an average of nearly 24 
questions per argument. He shows a slightly stronger than average tendency to side with the 
petitioner (457 cases, or 60.6%). In cases where he votes for the petitioner, his questioning 
pattern at oral argument practically a precise mirror of his questioning in cases where he votes 
for the respondent.

Questioning Patterns by Vote
Most of the justices are at least somewhat “antagonistic” in their questioning, in the sense that 
they tend to ask  more questions of the party for whom they will not be voting. In a nutshell, 
the party who receives fewer questions from Justice Scalia at oral argument can have some 
degree of confidence in Justice Scalia’s support at voting time. With Justice Scalia, this is a more 
reliable indicator than it is for most other justices: in the 40 cases in which he asked more than 
25 questions of the petitioner, he voted for the respondent only 10 times. Correspondingly, in 
the 40 cases in which Justice Scalia asked more than 27 questions of the respondent, he voted 
for the petitioner only 7 times. 
In the 67 cases where the questions were evenly distributed (i.e., less than a 
2-question difference between questions asked of the petitioner and questions asked of the 
respondent), he voted for the petitioner 60 times (roughly 89.5%). As a result, it would seem 
that Justice Scalia’s vote can be inferred with some degree of confidence from the distribution 
of his questions at oral argument. Of course, Justice Scalia’s vote may generally also be 
predicted based on the content of his questions at oral argument, but in cases where his vote is 
in doubt, the distribution of questions might be a worthwhile metric for those seeking to 
handicap the court.

Discussion
Not much can be said about Justice Thomas’s speech patterns at oral argument. 
He has spoken in only 12 cases eligible for in this study, uttering a total of 37 questions. 
Although the balance is quite lopsided (30 of the 37 questions were asked of the respondent), 
even such a striking pattern should not be taken as a serious statistical indicator in a sample 
this small. In cases where Justice Thomas spoke, he voted for the petitioner 8 times (75%), but 
again, that apparent bias may not be indicative of anything in particular. 
Justice Thomas’s silence at oral argument is countered, however, by his 
outspokenness in the written word: he has written an opinion of some sort (whether majority, 
concurrence, or dissent) in 671 of the 1,525 in which he has participated (44%), making him the 
court’s leader in terms of likelihood of submitting a written opinion in any given case.

Discussion
Thus far, Justice Kagan’s record with the court is remarkable mostly for the 
number of cases in which she has not participated: she has recused herself in 58% of the cases 
heard between the time she ascended to the bench and the time when the data for this study 
were collected. Of the 14 cases she has heard, only 13 were eligible for inclusion in the oral 
argument study. As the court’s newest member, there is not yet much data to go on, but her 
behavior thus far is different from that of her fellow justices.
In the first place, she has voted for the respondent in eight of the 13 cases 
studied: most justices, and the court as a whole, show at least a moderate statistical preference 
for the petitioner. Second, Justice Kagan tends to ask more questions of the petitioner 
regardless of what her vote turns out to be: in only three cases has she asked more questions of 
the respondent. While it is obviously too early to claim that these trends are in any way 
significant, it is interesting to note that Justice Kagan is bucking the court’s trends, at least at 
the outset of her tenure. 
As a final footnote, the fact that Justice Kagan has such a high rate of 
non-participation in cases has had an interesting side-effect: even though there are only 10 
cases in which she has voted with the majority, she has written three majority opinions. This is 
well over twice the  rate experienced by her more senior colleagues, and it shows an amusing 
-13-
(if predictable) dynamic in assignments: the fewer cases in which one participates, the more 
likely one will have to write the court’s opinion in those cases where one sides with the 
majority.

Justice Roberts spoke at oral argument in 265 cases suitable for inclusion in this 
study. In the cases examined, Justice Roberts voted for the petitioner 173 times (65%), and for 
the respondent 93 times (35%). He has asked a total of 2,475 questions of petitioners (an 
average of 9.34), 2,777 questions of respondents (an average of 10.48), and 166 questions of his 
fellow justices. These are not distributed evenly, however.
Questioning Patterns by Vote
In other words, in cases where Justice Roberts votes for the respondent, he asks an average of 
11.1 questions of the petitioner (and 9.66 of the respondent), and in cases where he votes for 
-14-
the petitioner, he asks an average of 10.9 questions of the respondent (and of the 8.4 of the 
petitioner). These numbers support the theory that, statistically speaking, Justice Roberts has a 
mildly antagonistic questioning style: he tends to ask more questions of the party against 
whom he will vote. This is a weaker correlation than we have observed with other justices, 
however.
Additionally, Justice Roberts sides with the majority in just over 90% of his votes. 
Surprisingly, this is slightly higher than Justice Kennedy’s percentage. The number of 
questions Justice Roberts asks of each party is therefore at least weakly correlated with the 
outcome of the case. Obviously, this does not establish any sort of causative relationship: one 
could not hope to win a case merely by confining one’s oral argument to topics unlikely to 
draw questions from Justice Roberts. Nevertheless, litigants seeking to divine the outcome of 
their cases after oral argument may wish to count the questions Justice Roberts asks of each 
side.
