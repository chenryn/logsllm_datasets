User: I have a python web service. My problem is when I changed my web service classes. I can't see the changes on the browser and I see last version of web service on the browser all the time.
I used Bottle framework and cgi.
Assistant: This is from my experience of using Django with Apache, but have you tried restarting your web server? Sometimes the web server will hold a copy of the  code in memory to speed up execution, but restarting your web server will make it reload all *.py files.
Providing more information about the technology stack you are using would help us help you :-)
