It sounds like you are experiencing an issue with your Python web service where changes to your classes are not being reflected in the browser. You mentioned that you are using the Bottle framework along with CGI.

Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Restart Your Web Server**: Sometimes, the web server caches the code in memory to improve performance. Restarting the web server will force it to reload the updated `.py` files. If you are using a standalone server (e.g., `bottle.run()`), simply stop and start the server again.

2. **Check for Caching**: Ensure that your browser is not caching the old version of the web service. You can do this by clearing your browser cache or using a private/incognito window.

3. **Verify File Changes**: Double-check that the changes you made to your classes have been saved correctly and that you are editing the correct files.

4. **Environment Configuration**: Make sure that your development environment is configured to pick up the latest changes. For example, if you are using an IDE, ensure that it is set to automatically save changes.

5. **Debugging**: Add some debug statements (e.g., `print` statements) to your code to verify that the new version is being executed. This can help you determine if the issue is with the server or the client.

If the problem persists, providing more details about your technology stack, such as the specific versions of the Bottle framework and any other relevant components, would be helpful in diagnosing the issue further.
