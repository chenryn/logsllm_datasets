I am attempting to run a Python 2.7 program on HTCondor, but after submitting the job and using `condor_q` to check its status, I noticed that the job is in a "held" state.

When I queried the job with `condor_q -analyze <jobNo>`, the error message was: 
```
Hold reason: Error from Ubuntu: Failed to execute '/var/lib/condor/execute/dir_12033/condor_exec.exe': (errno=8: 'Exec format error')
```

I am unsure how to resolve this issue, and any help would be greatly appreciated. As I am relatively new to both HTCondor and Ubuntu, step-by-step guidance would be very helpful.

**Update:**
I managed to solve the problem. The issue was related to the directory paths. I found that HTCondor was looking within its own files for the resources used by my submission program. To resolve this, I defined a variable in the `.py` file that contains the correct path to the resource.
