**Table 10: Selected Example Phishing Domains for 15 Different Brands**

Note: 
- "CID:32" indicates a web page only.
- "CID:35" indicates a mobile page only.
- The rest have both web and mobile pages.

### Analysis of Phishing Pages

The confirmed phishing pages target 281 brands, with 247 brands on the web and 255 on the mobile version. The remaining 421 brands do not have squatting phishing pages under their domains. Figure 11 illustrates the number of verified phishing pages for each brand, showing that the majority of brands have fewer than 10 squatting phishing pages. Most brands are impersonated by tens of squatting phishing pages.

Figure 13 highlights the brands most frequently targeted by squatting phishing domains. Google stands out as the most impersonated brand, with 194 phishing pages across web and mobile. This is significantly higher than the second and third most-targeted brands, which have 40 or fewer squatting phishing pages. Popular brands such as Ford, Facebook, Bitcoin, Amazon, and Apple are also heavily targeted.

Figure 14 provides examples of squatting phishing pages that mimic the target brands at both the content and domain levels.

### Mobile vs. Web Phishing

An interesting observation is that the number of phishing pages differs between mobile and web. There are more mobile phishing pages, indicating a cloaking behavior where phishing websites only respond to certain types of user devices. Among the 1,175 phishing domains, only 590 have both web and mobile phishing pages. 318 domains show phishing pages only to mobile users, while 267 return phishing pages only to web users. A possible reason for this targeting of mobile users is that mobile browsers often do not display warning pages like web browsers. During manual analysis, we used Chrome on a laptop and a mobile Chrome browser to visit the confirmed phishing domains. The laptop Chrome was more likely to show alert pages compared to the mobile browser for the same domain. We observed the same phenomenon with Safari on both platforms.

Recent studies suggest that the UI design of mobile browsers can make users more vulnerable to phishing. For example, mobile browsers often cannot fully display long URLs in the address bar, limiting a user's ability to examine the domain name. In our dataset, the longest domain name is "buy-bitcoin-with-paypal-paysafecard-credit-card-ukash.com," which has 57 characters.

### IP Location

We examined the geolocation of the IP addresses of the phishing domains. We were able to determine the geolocation of 1,021 IP addresses, hosted in 53 different countries. Figure 15 shows the distribution of IP addresses in different countries, with the U.S. hosting the most sites, followed by Germany.

### Domain Name Registration

We obtained the WHOIS records of the phishing domain names and analyzed their registration times and registrars. As shown in Figure 16, most squatting phishing domain names were registered within the past four years. Based on the WHOIS records, only 738 domains contain registrar information. Out of 121 different registrars, the most popular is GoDaddy.com, with 157 squatting phishing domain names.

### Squatting Types and Case Studies

We examined the squatting methods used by the phishing domains. Figure 12 shows that there are squatting phishing pages for each method. Combo squatting domains contain the largest number of phishing pages, as they are less competitive to register. We found over 200 phishing pages in homograph, bitsquatting, and typo squatting domains, which are more difficult to register. Table 10 provides examples of phishing domains using different squatting types. We selected six examples and presented their screenshots in Figure 14, along with inferred motivations behind the squatting phishing pages.

- **Fake Search Engine**: Figure 14a shows an example of bitsquatting. The phishing domain "goofle.com.ua" impersonates Google’s search engine hosted in Ukraine by changing one character. Possible motivations include censorship to monitor search queries or serving specific advertisements.
- **Offline Scam**: Figure 14b shows an example of combo squatting. The phishing domain "go-uberfreight.com" impersonates Uber Freight, likely to steal truck drivers' accounts for offline scams.
- **Payroll Scam**: Figure 14d shows a payroll scam on ADP. The phishing page "mobile-adp.com" impersonates the official mobile domain "mobile.adp.com" through combo squatting.
- **Tech Support Scam**: Figure 14c shows a tech support scam with the combo-squatting domain "live-microsoftsupport.com," impersonating Microsoft’s online support.

### Evasion Techniques

We examined whether and how squatting phishing pages adopt evasion techniques. Table 11 compares verified squatting phishing pages with non-squatting phishing pages from PhishTank. Squatting phishing pages have a higher level of layout obfuscation and a higher ratio of string obfuscation (68.1%–68.2%) compared to non-squatting phishing pages (35.9%). Code obfuscation is less common among squatting phishing pages.

To test how likely these phishing pages can evade existing blacklists, we ran the list of verified squatting phishing domains against several popular blacklists in May 2018. Only 2 of our squatting phishing domains were reported in PhishTank (0.1%). VirusTotal, which contains over 70 blacklists, marked 110 (8.2%) of the squatting phishing domains. eCrimeX, a phishing blacklist maintained by the Anti-Phishing Work Group (APWG), did not detect any of the squatting phishing domains.

### Conclusion

This study provides insights into the nature and behavior of squatting phishing domains. The findings highlight the need for improved detection and prevention measures, especially for mobile users and in the context of new and evolving squatting techniques.
