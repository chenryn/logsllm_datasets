testing data is orders of magnitude larger, it is possible that certain
variances are not captured during the small-scale training. A poten-
tial way of improvement is to feed the newly confirmed phishing
pages back to the training data to re-enforce the classifier training
(future work).
As shown in Table 8, the confirmed phishing
Targeted Brands.
pages are targeting 281 brands (247 brands on the web, and 255
brands on the mobile version). The rest of the 421 brands do not have
squatting phishing pages under their squatting domains. Figure 11
shows the number of verified phishing pages for each brand. We
show the vast majority of brands have fewer than 10 squatting
phishing pages. Most brands are impersonated by tens of squatting
phishing pages.
To illustrate the brands that are highly targeted by squatting
phishing domains, we plot Figure 13. We observe that google stand-
out as the mostly impersonated brands with 194 phishing pages
across web and mobile. Google’s number if much higher than the
second and third brands which all have 40 or below squatting phish-
ing pages. We observe the popular brands such as ford, facebook,
bitcoin, amazon, and apple are among the heavily targeted brands.
Figure 14 shows a few example squatting phishing pages that mimic
the target brands at both the content level and the domain level.
An interesting observation is that mobile and
Mobile vs. Web.
web does not have the same number of phishing pages. There are
more mobile phishing pages. This indicates a cloaking behavior —
the phishing websites only respond to certain types of user devices.
Among the 1175 phishing domains, only 590 domains have both
web and mobile phishing pages. 318 domains only show phishing
pages to mobile users but not to web users; 267 domains return
phishing pages to web users only. A possible reason for attackers to
target mobile users is that mobile browsers do not always show the
warning pages like the web browsers. During manual analysis, we
used a Chrome browser on the laptop and a mobile Chrome browser
to visit the confirmed phishing domains. The laptop Chrome is more
likely to show the alert page compared to the mobile browser for
the same domain. We also tested the laptop and mobile version of
Safari and observed the same phenomenon.
As a related note, recent studies show that mobile browsers’ UI
design could make users more vulnerable to phishing [44, 52]. For
example, mobile browsers often cannot fully display very long URLs
in the address bar, and thus only show the leftmost or the rightmost
part to users. This design limits a user’s ability to examine the do-
main name of the (phishing) URL. In our case, we only a few long
domain names from the 1175 phishing domains. For example, the
longest domain name is “buy-bitcoin-with-paypal-paysafecard
-credit-card-ukash.com” which has 57 characters.
IP Location. We further examine the geolocation of the IP
addresses of the phishing domains. In total, we are able to look

and we highlight the top countries with the most IP addresses.
These phishing sites are widely spread all over the world. The U.S.
has most of the sites, followed by Germany (DE).
Finally, we obtain the whois

records of the phishing domain names and examine their regis-
tration time and registrars. As shown in Figure 16, most of the
squatting phishing domain names were registered within the re-
cent 4 years. Based on the whois records, only 738 domains contain
the registrar information. We find that out of 121 different registrar
institutions, the most popular registrar is godaddy.com with 157
squatting phishing domain names.
6.2 Squatting Types & Case Studies
Next, we examine the squatting methods used by squatting phishing
domains. As shown in Figure 12, there are squatting phishing pages
under each every squatting method. It is not too surprising that
combo squatting domains contain the largest number of phishing
pages since they are less competitive to register, i.e., attackers can
add arbitrary strings to the target brand names. We find over 200
phishing pages within homograph squatting domains, bits squatting
domains and typo squatting domains, which are more difficult to
register. Table 10 shows a few examples of the phishing domains of
different squatting types. We select 6 examples and present their
screenshots in Figure 14, and infer the motivations behind the
squatting phishing pages.
Figure 14a presents an interesting ex-
Fake Search Engine.
ample of bits squatting. The phishing domain “goofle.com.ua” is
trying to impersonate Google’s search engine hosted in Ukraine
“google.com.ua”, by changing one character “g”. A possible mo-
tivation of this page is to perform censorship to monitor what
searching queries that Ukraine citizens are performing. Another
(more likely) motivation is that this website impersonates Google
search to serve specific advertisements to users. Through manual
examination, we find that the fake search engine not only displays
more advertisements, but the advertisements are also different from
those on the real site, given the same searching query (the searching
results are relatively consistent).
Figure 14b shows an example of combo squatting.
Offline Scam.
The squatting phishing domain is “go-uberfreight.com”, which
impersonates Uber Freight, a new service of Uber to connect truck
drivers with shippers. The official site is freight.uber.com. The
purpose of the phishing page is likely to steal truck drivers’ Uber
accounts. Note that truck drivers’ accounts are very difficult to reg-
ister which takes background checks and virtual/on-site interviews.
It is possible that the attacker is trying to steal truck driver’s account
for offline scams, for example, to impersonate a Uber truck driver to
pick up and steal valuable goods. Another related example is shown
in Figure 14e where the phishing domain “driveforuber.com” is
impersonating the official Uber site “drive.uber.com”.
Figure 14d shows a payroll scam on ADP. ADP
Payroll Scam.
offers payroll services for employees of various companies. ADP’s
official mobile domain is “mobile.adp.com”. The phishing page
“mobile-adp.com” is impersonating the mobile page of ADP through
combo squatting. Interestingly, the login form on the phishing page
is dynamically loaded by a JavaScript. We find that the login form
will show up only if a user did not have an adblocker.
Figure 14c shows an example of tech sup-
Tech Support Scam.
port scam with a combo-squatting domain. The phishing domain
“live-microsoftsupport.com” is impersonating the online sup-
port of Microsoft “support.microsoft.com”. The page either tries
to compromise a user’s Microsoft account or tricks the user to call
the listed phone number. For tech support scams, scammers behind
the phone often guide the victim to install malware or pay the
“service fee” [49].

Stealing Payment Accounts. More commonly, squatting phish-
ing pages aim to compromise user accounts at payment services.
For example, Figure 14f is a phishing page that impersonates Citi-
zens Bank’s official page “citizenslc.com”. The phishing domain
is a combo squatting domain “securemail-citizenslc.com”.
6.3 Evasion
We next examine whether and how squatting phishing pages would
perform evasion against common detection techniques.
Squatting vs. Non-Squatting Phishing. We first examine
whether squatting phishing pages are more likely to adopt evasion
techniques. In Table 11, we directly compare the verified squat-
ting phishing pages with non-squatting phishing pages labelled in
PhishTank (URLs without squatting domains). As shown in Table 11,
squatting phishing pages have a higher level of layout obfuscation.
In addition, there is a higher ratio of squatting phishing pages that
adopted string obfuscation (68.1%–68.2%) than that of non-squatting
phishing pages (35.9%). Code obfuscation is less common among
squatting phishing pages.
The phishing pages detected
Evading Popular Blacklists.
by our system are largely previous-unknown phishing pages. To
examine how likely they can evade existing blacklist, we perform a
quick test. As shown in Table 12, we run the list of verified squat-
ting phishing domains against several popular phishing blacklists
in May 2018. First, we checked the PhishTank and find that only
2 of our squatting phishing domains have been reported (0.1%).
Then we query VirusTotal [16], which contains over 70 different
blacklists. These 70 blacklists collectively marked 110 (8.2%) of
squatting phishing domains. Finally, examine eCrimeX [4], a phish-
ing blacklist maintained by the Anti Phishing Work Group (APWG).
