User: I want to set permission (777) to my directory ( including all the files and subdirectories ) in one line, don't want to use any os.walk or for loop
Assistant: You can call subprocess and run normal system command from there:
did not test but I think this should work:
subprocess.call(["chmod", "-R 777 /PATH"])
