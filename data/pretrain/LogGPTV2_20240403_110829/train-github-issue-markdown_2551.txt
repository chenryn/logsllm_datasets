When using responsive classes to show or hide elements, it is recommended to use `inline-block` instead of `block` if you want to apply these classes to inline elements. Using `block` can disrupt the natural flow of the content, whereas `inline-block` will maintain the inline layout while still allowing for responsive behavior.
