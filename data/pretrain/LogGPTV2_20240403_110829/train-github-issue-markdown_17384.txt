# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
Make it easier to create a terminal similar to Windows Terminal that capable
of running on Windows 7.
# A clear and concise description of what the problem is that the new feature
would solve.
Provide a better terminal experience for organizations that still utilize
Windows 7.
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
Missing features:
  * You'll need conpty to be able to serve as the console API server on windows 7. You'd have to take the conhost.exe and bring it with you to be able to run on Windows 7. Dependent on the next item:
  * Conhost.exe was changed for Windows 8 to use condrv to handle console API calls, instead of _whatever it was using before_. So if you want to run conhost on Windows 7, you'll need to update it to be able to handle the windows 7 style connection. - Help wanted
  * You'll need XAML Islands ported to windows 7 to be able to host our UI - XAML Islands can be used in WPF. See this blog post.
  * Need appx infrastructure to be able to install the .msix on Windows 7. Msix packaging supports Win7.
  * Need SxS WinRT activation downlevel to be able to support running  
the terminal as administrator. WPF can be used for this instead.
Probably more. Add to the list as needed.
