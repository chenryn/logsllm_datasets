User: I'm taking a python course, I save exercise scripts in /this/is/where/I save/exercises/exercise.py.
Now whenever I type python in terminal it immediately gives me this:
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/this/is/where/I save/exercises/exercise.py'
I know it's not found since I deleted the file. But why is python running that script whenever it runs? It's annoying.
INFO
Linux OS
Python2 and Python3 both show same error
Assistant: Python has a special script that is run on startup. On my platform it is located at /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sitecustomize.py IIRC. You may want to check that file for any script calls to that directory. Also, if you are on a linux machine you could check /etc/bashrc or /etc/profile.d. If that doesn't help, try to update your question with more specific information.
