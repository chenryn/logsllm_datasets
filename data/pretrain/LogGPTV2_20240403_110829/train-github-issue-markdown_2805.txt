**TypeScript Version:**
1.8.9

**Documentation Reference:**
According to the TypeScript documentation at [http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html), `--traceResolution` is listed as a compiler option. I intended to use this option to help diagnose errors, but it seems that this option has either been removed or renamed.

**Command Executed:**
```bash
tsc -p . --traceResolution
```

**Expected Behavior:**
I expected the command to provide information on why my module cannot be found, even though it is located in the `node_modules` folder and the `package.json` file contains the correct `main` and `typings` paths.

**Actual Behavior:**
The following error message was displayed:
```
error TS5023: Unknown compiler option 'traceresolution'.
```

**Additional Context:**
- The module in question is present in the `node_modules` directory.
- The `package.json` file for the module includes the `main` and `typings` fields, which are set up correctly.
- I am using TypeScript version 1.8.9, and I suspect that the `--traceResolution` option may have been introduced in a later version or may have a different name in this version.
