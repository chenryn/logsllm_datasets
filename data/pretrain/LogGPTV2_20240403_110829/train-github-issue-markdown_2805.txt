**TypeScript Version:**
Version 1.8.9
The documentation here:  
http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html  
Lists `--traceResolution` as a compiler option to which I intended to use to
help diagnose errors; however, it appears this was removed or changed names.
**Code**
     tsc -p . --traceResolution
**Expected behavior:**  
I expected this to tell me why my module cannot be found even though it is in
the node_modules folder and has package.json with main and typings paths setup
correctly.
**Actual behavior:**  
`error TS5023: Unknown compiler option 'traceresolution'.`
