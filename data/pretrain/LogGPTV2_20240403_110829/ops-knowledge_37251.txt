User: I have a project that already written in php, and now i am using python in google app engine, actually i want to use the api that google support for python, for example : datastore, blobstore ... and also to save my time to re write the code again in python !
so, is it possible to run php script in python code ?
Assistant: Those runtimes (Py, PHP, Java. etc.) are isolated from each other and are tightly sandboxed. So when you deploy a Python app, for example, it doesn't have access to the PHP or Java runtime. So, it's not possible to run PHP inside a python sandbox, at least not in the appengine platform.
