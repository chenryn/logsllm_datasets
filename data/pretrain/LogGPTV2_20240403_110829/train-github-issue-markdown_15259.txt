When a form is submitted with an invalid CSRF token, the current error message displayed is: `The CSRF token is invalid. Please try to resubmit the form.` This message inadvertently provides instructions that could be misused to bypass CSRF protection, making the security measure less effective.

To improve the messaging and enhance security, please update the error message to: `Your session has expired. Please return to the home page and try again.`

This revised message will provide a more secure and user-friendly experience.
