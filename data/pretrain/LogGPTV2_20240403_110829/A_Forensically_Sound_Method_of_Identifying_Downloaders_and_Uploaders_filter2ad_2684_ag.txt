PROOF: We bound the Power probability from below. That is,
we show that the probability of an actual requester issuing less
than ϱ falls exponentially. We make use of a well-known Chernoff
bound [64].
Pr[X ≤ ϱ] =
(16)
for 0  0 and д  0.38 > 1/3. Since the derivative f ′(x) = ln(1 + x) is
greater than ln(2) for all x ≥ 1, our claim is true. Next, we start
with the well-known Chernoff bound [64]:
We need only show that
Pr[A ≥ (1 + δ)µ] ≤
, for δ > 0.

The last inequality is true because of our earlier claim.
