### Title: Optimistic Dissatisfaction with the Status Quo: Steps We Must Take to Improve Security in Complex Landscapes

Working in security is a principled decision. Many of us choose this path because we are committed to making technology more reliable and safer for our friends, families, and society at large. While your skills may have secured you a job, it is your principles and drive that have honed those skills.

Transforming your ideals into tangible, scalable outcomes is a formidable challenge. The landscape is riddled with interconnected networks, billions of lines of ever-evolving code, third-party dependencies, legacy requirements, competing priorities, conflicting incentives, and dubious solutions. These technical challenges are compounded by social and communication barriers, as well as endless philosophical debates.

So, how do we actually make technology safer in such complex environments, and on a large scale?

In this talk, Parisa will offer guiding advice that security practitioners and leaders must embrace to succeed. Drawing from her extensive experience leading some of the largest, ongoing security initiatives aimed at enhancing user safety, she will share several key insights:

1. **Rethinking Vulnerability Disclosure**: Parisa will discuss how redefining the rules of vulnerability disclosure has pushed major software companies to achieve measurably faster patching and enhanced end-user security.
   
2. **Grassroots Efforts and Secure Transport**: She will share the story of a grassroots side project that successfully shifted a majority of the web ecosystem to secure transport, nearly 25 years after the technology was first introduced.

3. **Implementing an Intern’s Publication**: Finally, Parisa will review the significant effort to implement an intern’s research in one of today’s largest open-source projects. This project, which took over five years of refactoring and faced numerous attempts to defund the work, ultimately helped the world's most popular browser mitigate a new class of hardware vulnerabilities earlier this year.

By embracing these strategies and lessons, we can move closer to making technology safer and more secure for everyone.
