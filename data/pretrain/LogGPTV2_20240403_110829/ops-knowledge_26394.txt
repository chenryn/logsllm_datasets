User: Please explain what is container technology? How is it different from a virtual machine? How to use Docker to manage and run containers?
Assistant: Container technology is a lightweight virtualization technology that packages applications and their dependencies into a portable container so that it can run in multiple environments. Unlike traditional full operating system virtualization, container technology only virtualizes the running environment of applications, so it is lighter, faster, and easier to manage than virtual machines. A typical representative of container technology is Docker. Different from virtual machines, container technology packages applications in a container, and containers share the same operating system kernel. Containers use operating system resources, while virtual machines use hardware resources. The advantage of container technology is that it runs fast, is more lightweight, and can be deployed, upgraded and configured quickly. On the other hand, a virtual machine needs to run a complete operating system, which will occupy more resources and is difficult to quickly deploy and manage. Docker is an application container engine that helps users build, publish and run containers. Users can use Docker to manage and run containers. First, they need to select a Docker image (like a container template), and then use the Docker command to create and start a container. Users can configure the environment and run applications inside the container, and use Docker commands to stop and delete the container. Docker also provides a wealth of tools and plug-ins for users to manage and monitor the running status of containers. By using Docker, users can easily deploy, upgrade, configure and manage containers.
