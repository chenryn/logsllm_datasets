User: I write a Python 2.5 Command Line program on CentOS 5.5 and it has been running for 1 day and is still running. Now I want to end this program but get the value of a global variable.
I have done some Google. It seems the only way to get the value of a global variable is to attach the Python program to a GDB.
Suppose the global variable is a List, and its name is resultlist. How can I get its value?
Assistant: I'm afraid names won't help you much. Since you didn't build in some printing mechanism and your process is already running you're pretty much screwed.
If you have an idea what the values might be your best bet would be using a process memory scanner and start messing around. Though I estimate your chances of success very low, I'm sorry.
