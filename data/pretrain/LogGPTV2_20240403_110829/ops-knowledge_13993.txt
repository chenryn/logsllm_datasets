### Summary of the Log Chunk

This log chunk, consisting of 20 lines, provides a detailed record of activities in a distributed file system, specifically focusing on the interactions between the `DataNode` and `FSNamesystem` components. Here is a step-by-step summary of the key events:

1. **Block Reception by DataNodes:**
   - Multiple `DataNode$DataXceiver` and `DataNode$PacketResponder` instances are receiving blocks from various sources.
   - Each block is identified by a unique block ID (e.g., `blk_-8703611999267892995`).
   - The source and destination IP addresses and ports are logged for each block transfer.
   - For example, at `2008-11-11 05:04:14`, a block with ID `blk_-8703611999267892995` is received from `/10.250.15.101:32889` to `/10.250.15.101:50010`.

2. **Block Map Updates by FSNamesystem:**
   - The `FSNamesystem` component updates the `blockMap` with the new block information.
   - This includes adding the source IP address and port to the block map and recording the block size.
   - For instance, at `2008-11-11 05:04:26`, the `blockMap` is updated to include `10.250.15.101:50010` for block `blk_-5352085087037370841` with a size of `67108864` bytes.

3. **PacketResponder Terminations:**
   - Several `PacketResponder` instances terminate after completing their tasks.
   - For example, at `2008-11-11 05:07:10`, `PacketResponder 2` for block `blk_-2268450354164990110` terminates.

### Key Observations:
- **Block Size Consistency:** Most blocks have a consistent size of `67108864` bytes, except for one block (`blk_4777657900314457675`) with a size of `3546628` bytes.
- **High Frequency of Block Transfers:** The log shows frequent block transfers and updates, indicating active data movement within the distributed file system.
- **Multiple DataNodes Involved:** Various DataNodes (identified by different process IDs) are involved in receiving and processing blocks, suggesting a distributed and load-balanced system.

### Conclusion:
The log entries demonstrate the dynamic and continuous operation of the distributed file system, with DataNodes efficiently handling block transfers and the FSNamesystem maintaining an up-to-date block map. The system appears to be functioning correctly, with no errors or warnings noted in this log chunk.
