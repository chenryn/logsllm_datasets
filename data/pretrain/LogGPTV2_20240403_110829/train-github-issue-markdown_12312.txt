For the sake of clarity/modularisation in my XML I am trying to separate out
certain service definitions into separate files. It would be nice to see the
re-emergence of 'merge' on the util: collection definitions in a way that
definitions with the same ID are merged.
For example (hope this submits in a readable way):
[services.xml]  
[service1.xml]  
[service2.xml]  
There are probably workarounds for this, but for the moment I would be forced
to have the serviceMap defined completely in a single place.
