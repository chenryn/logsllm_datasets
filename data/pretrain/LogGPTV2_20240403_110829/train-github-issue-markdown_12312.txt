**Thomas Timbul** opened **SPR-5199** and provided the following comment:

For the sake of clarity and modularity in my XML, I am attempting to separate certain service definitions into individual files. It would be beneficial to reintroduce the 'merge' functionality for `util` namespace collection definitions, allowing definitions with the same ID to be merged.

For example (I hope this is presented in a readable format):

- [services.xml]
- [service1.xml]
- [service2.xml]

While there may be workarounds for this, currently, I am required to define the `serviceMap` entirely within a single file.
