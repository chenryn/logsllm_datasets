Introductions 
What’s this talk about? 
•  De-evolution of User Security Experience (in Mobile 
Devices) 
•  History and Types of SSL Attacks 
•  Lack of Testing Tools for Mobile Applications 
•  How Various App and Devices Perform Under “SSL Stress” 
•  A Tool Release to Help Solve this Problem

Primer / History: SSL and MITM Attacks 
What is SSL? 
•  Stands for “Secure Sockets Layer” 
•  Developed by Netscape in 1994 
• 
Implemented in Netscape Navigator 1.0 
•  A protocol to secure a client->server data transmission 
•  Uses Asymmetric Keys to establish a Symmetric Key 
• 
This happens during a “handshake” before actual data is transmitted 
Copyright Trustwave 2011 
Primer / History: SSL and MITM Attacks 
• 
Where is SSL (certs) Used? 
• 
To Establish Secure Client to Server Communication 
• 
Client Identity (User Authentication) 
• 
Application Signing 
• 
Log File Integrity 
Copyright Trustwave 2011 
Primer / History: SSL and MITM Attacks 
• 
How is SSL used in Mobile Devices? 
• 
To Secure Communication Over Public Networks 
• 
To Establish “App” to Server Communication 
• 
“App” Code Signing (Android, IOS, BlackBerryOS) 
• 
Mobile Device Management Profiles (Signed)

Primer / History: SSL and MITM Attacks 
• 
What is a Man-in-the-Middle Attack? 
• 
Injecting an “Attacker” between a Client and a Server Session. 
• 
“Attacker” intercepts Client request to Server 
• 
“Attacker” established a SECURE Session with Server 
• 
“Attacker” established a UNTRUSTED Session with Client 
• 
“Attacker” can then view / modified data between Client and 
Server

Primer / History: SSL and MITM Attacks 
• 
What tools exist to help w/ MITM Attacks? 
• 
thicknet – MITM framework developed by Steve Ocepek 
(SpiderLabs) 
• 
ettercap – “is a suite for man in the middle attacks on LAN” 
• 
arpspoof – facilitates “arp poising”  
• 
mitmproxy – “is an SSL-capable, intercepting HTTP proxy” 
• 
sslstrip – relies on arpspoof then“strips” the SSL session to 
force Client to talk HTTP to attacker

Primer / History: SSL and MITM Attacks 
• 
Why is true SSL MITM difficult? 
• 
SSL certificates have a “chain of trust” 
• 
Attacking public CAs not impossible, but not practical 
• 
Self-Signed Certs throw Client errors 
• 
Malformed Certs are difficult to generate

Mobile SSL User Experience 
• 
No Standard UI 
• 
Most Cases -> No UI At ALL! 
• 
Cryptic Warming Messages 
• 
Users Don’t Know the Difference 
• 
Pop-up could be BS 
Copyright Trustwave 2011 
Research Motivations 
• 
The Browser Community spent almost two decades 
tweaking the UI behavior when it comes to SSL 
• 
The Mobile Device market destroyed that in less 
than five years 
• 
There are no standards that today’s mobile users 
expect to see when their data is transmitted via SSL 
Copyright Trustwave 2011 
Research Motivations 
•  Most apps completely ignore the UI aspect of security 
•  There is zero functionality difference between an 
app that sends data in the clear vs. encrypted 
• 
App developers need to pay attention to this, but also 
need tools to help them test SSL behavior easily 
and consistently  
Copyright Trustwave 2011 
Research Implications 
• 
Attackers are focusing more mobile app weaknesses 
• 
If a popular app mishandles SSL, their users are more 
susceptible to attacks 
• 
Credential Stealing 
• 
Data Interception 
• 
Response Manipulation 
• 
These attacks will go unnoticed due to: 
• 
Lack of User Awareness of the Risks 
• 
Lack of UI Cues within Apps

Data Transmission Assault Course Components 
• 
How do you build a test lab? 
• 
Wireless Switch 
• 
WRT-54GL running Tomato Firmware 
• 
Attacker System 
• 
Linux (must be connect via Ethernet to Switch) 
• 
ettercapNG-0.7.3 (w/ SpiderLabs patch) 
• 
Victim Clients 
• 
Android (Nexus S – v2.3.4) 
• 
iPod Touch 4th Gen (v4.3.3)

Data Transmission Assault Course Components 
What types of SSL certs do you need? 
1.  Valid for Target Domain (i.e. www.myapp.com) 
2.  Various Malformed SSL Certificates: 
•  Null Prefix (big news in 2010) 
•  CRLF 
•  Self-Signed 
•  Signed by Parent Cert (set CA:FALSE) 
•  Invalid ASN.1 Structures (Fuzzing) 
•  Broken Encodings 
3.  A Method to Generate the Above Easily…  
Copyright Trustwave 2011 
Introducing SSLizzard - About  
• 
SSLizzard is an open source toolkit to easily generate 
multiple types of invalid SSL certs for ANY given domain. 
• 
The output is then used in various MITM frameworks to 
perform the SSL attack 
• 
Successfully tested with ettercap (see patch on DVD) 
• 
A thicknet module is being developed by Steve Ocepek. 
• 
Can be used against any OS, Application or Browser.   
Copyright Trustwave 2011 
Introducing SSLizzard – Uses / Usage  
• 
Command Line 
• 
ruby sslizzard.rb mydomain.com 
• 
Generates a key and a number of certificates 
with various invalid structures for testing.  
• 
Output is written in the current working 
directory 
Copyright Trustwave 2011 
Introducing SSLizzard – Setup a Test  
• 
Execute SSLizzard to generate certs 
• 
Set up ettercap (patched) with –x flag to specify cert 
type you want to test 
• 
Use your app as normal and see if you get error msgs 
• 
If you don’t get errors, check ettercap to see if data 
was intercepted 
• 
You will need to execute ettercap once per cert type 
generated by SSLizzard to comprehensively test 
Copyright Trustwave 2011 
Introducing SSLizzard - Demo  
• 
Generating a collection of certs 
• 
Using the certs in ettercap (SpiderLabs patch) 
• 
Video of interception of traffic 
• 
Video of victim devices throwing errors/not 
throwing errors

Conclusions 
We need a world where: 
•  Developers use SSL for all data transmission 
•  Consistent, simple, UI that users can understand 
•  Apps and Devices that fail closed when there is a 
secure transmission problem
