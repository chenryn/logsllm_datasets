### Problem description
The v1 documentation here states that, "The CSS injected by Material-UI to
style a component has the lowest specificity possible as the is injected at
the top of the ". However, I am observing locally that the styles are being
injected at the _bottom_ of . I do not have any custom configuration set for
JSS, so I don't believe anything in my codebase would be causing the
difference in behavior.
I'm trying to follow the JSS docs to customize the insertion point via a
comment, but everything I do within `jss.setup()` seems to be overriden with a
MUIThemProvider that uses`muiThemeProviderFactory.js`, which I don't have
direct access to.
The docs examples use `getContext`, but that seems like a _lot_ of extra
boilerplate just to set a CSS insertion point. Does anyone have any advice on
how I can get the JSS styles to actually render at the bottom of the `` element?
I'm reporting this here instead of SO, because I believe that the
documentation is incorrect, and could use some examples for what I would
expect to be a common use case for MUI consumers that don't also rely on JSS
as their primary styling solution.
