work effectively, capturing non-English promotional infections
(see Section V).
Searching for inconsistency. The Inconsistency Searcher is
designed to Ô¨Ånd out the IBTs with great semantic gaps with
a given sTLD, and use the terms to search the sTLD for
suspicious (potentially compromised) FQDNs. To this end, we
Ô¨Årst selected a small set of seed IBTs as an input to the system.
These IBTs were collected from spam trigger word lists [13],
[14] and SEO competitive word list [15], which are popular
terms used in counterfeit medicine selling, online gambling
and Phishing. From those terms, the most irrelevant ones are
picked up for analyzing a given sTLD. Such terms are found
by comparing them with the semantics proÔ¨Åle of the FQDN,
that is, the set of keywords output by the Semantics Finder.
SpeciÔ¨Åcally, such a semantic comparison is performed by
SEISE using a word-embedding tool called word2vec [12],
a neural network that builds a vector representation for each
term by learning from the context in which the term occurs. In
our research, we utilized the English Wikipedia pages as the
context for each term to compute its vector and measure the
distance between two words using their vectors. In this way,
the IBTs irrelevant to a given sTLD can be found and used to
search under the FQDN for detecting the suspicious ones. The
approach works as follows:
‚Ä¢ We downloaded all 30 GB Wikipedia pages and ran a program
to preprocess those pages by removing tables and images while
preserving their captions. Individual sentences on the pages
were further tokenized into terms using a phrase parser.
‚Ä¢ Given an input term (an IBT or a keyword in the sTLD‚Äôs
semantics proÔ¨Åle), our approach runs word2vec to train a
skip-gram model, which maps the term into a high-dimensional
vector (cid:4)d1, d2, ...di, ...(cid:5) to describes the term‚Äôs semantics. This
vector is generated from all the sentences involving the term,
with individual elements describing the term‚Äôs relations with
other terms in the same sentence across all such sentences in
the Wikipedia dataset.
‚Ä¢ Given the vectors of an IBT and an sTLD keyword, our
approach measures the semantic distance between them by
calculating the cosine distance between their vectors. For
each IBT, its average distance to all the keywords is used to
determine its effectiveness in detecting promotional infections.
In our research, we found that when the distance becomes
0.6 (at least 20 terms are still there within our seed set) or
more, almost no compromised site is missing (see Figure 5(a) in
Section V). The IBTs selected according to such a threshold are
then sent to the search engine together with the sTLD through
the query site:sTLD+IBT (e.g.,site:edu casino). From the search
result page, top 100 items (URLs) are further inspected by
the Context Analyzer to determine whether related FQDNs
are indeed compromised, which is detailed in the followed
subsection.
As an example, again, let us look at Figure 3: in this case,
the IBT ‚Äúcasino‚Äù has a distance of 0.72 with regard to the
semantics of .edu and therefore was run under the sTLD; from
the search pages, top FQDNs, including mysau3.arbor.edu,
www.unlv.edu, were examined to detect compromised FQDNS.
Analyzing IBT context. As mentioned earlier, even the terms
most irrelevant to an sTLD could show up on some of its pages
for a legitimate reason. For example, the word ‚Äòcasino‚Äô has a
signiÔ¨Åcant semantic distance with the sTLD .edu, which does
not mean, however, that the .edu sites cannot carry a poster
about one‚Äôs travel to Las Vegas or a research article about a
study on the gambling industry. Actually, a direct search of the
term site:edu casino yields a result page with some of the items
being legitimate. To identify those compromised FQDNs, the
Context Analyzer automatically examines the individual FQDN
on the result page, using a differential analysis (Figure 2) to
detect those truly compromised.
More speciÔ¨Åcally, the differential analysis involves two
independent queries, one on the suspicious FQDN together
with the IBT (e.g., site:life.sunysb.edu casino) and the other on
the FQDN alone (e.g., site:life.sunysb.edu) whose results page
serves as the reference. The idea is based on the observation
that in a promotional infection, the adversary has to post
similar text on many different pages (sometimes pointing to
the same site) for promoting similar products or content. This

Fig. 4: IBT SET Extension. The process to Ô¨Ånd IBTs in new category consists of Ô¨Åve steps: Injected URLs are collected to Ô¨Ånd the injected
directory path (¬ñ). Then, the injected directory path is used as search keyword, i.e., site:www.lgma.ca.gov/play to list more search result
items (¬ó). After fetching search result snippets(¬ò), critical terms are extracted (¬ô), and those that show semantics irrelevance are Ô¨Åltered for
clustering (¬ö). Once a new cluster is formed, we manually check and label it with its semantics.
is necessary because the target site‚Äôs rank needs multiple
highly-ranked pages on the compromised site to promote.
The problem for such an attack is that the irrelevant content,
which is supposed to rarely appear under the FQDN, becomes
anomalously homogenous and pervasive under a speciÔ¨Åc IBT.
As a result, when we look at the search results of the IBT
under the FQDN, their URLs and snippets tend to carry the
words rarely showing up across the generic content (i.e., the
reference) with much higher frequencies than their accidental
occurrences under the FQDN. On the other hand, in the case of
legitimate content including the IBT, the search results (for the
IBT under the FQDN) will be much more diverse and the words
involved in the IBT‚Äôs context often appear on the reference
and are compatible with the generic content of the site; even
for the irrelevant terms in the context, their frequencies tend
to be much lower than those in the malicious context. This is
because it is unlikely that the term irrelevant to the theme of
the site accidentally appears in similar context across many
pages, which introduces an additional set of highly-frequent
irrelevant terms. As an example, let us look at Figure 3(a) that
shows a compromised FQDN and Figure 3(b) that illustrates a
legitimate FQDN. The highly-frequent words extracted from
the former under the IBT ‚Äòcasino‚Äô, such as ‚Äòbookmarkporlet‚Äô,
‚Äòdealers‚Äô, ‚Äòslot‚Äô, never show up across the URLs and snippets of
the reference that represents the generic content of the FQDN
(the result of the query site:mysau3.arbor.edu). In contrast, a
query of the legitimate FQDN using the same IBT yields a
list of results whose URLs and snippets have highly diverse
content, with some of their words also included in the generic
content, such as ‚Äòclass‚Äô, ‚Äòeducation‚Äô and ‚Äòuniversity‚Äô, and most
others (except the IBT itself) occurring infrequently.
To compare the two search result pages for identifying the
truly compromised site, the Context Analyzer picks up top
10 search results from each query and converts them into a
high dimensional vector. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, our approach focuses
on the URL and the content snippet for each result item.
We segment them into words using delimiters such as space,
comma, dash, etc., and remove stop words (those extremely
common words like ‚Äòshe‚Äô, ‚Äòdo‚Äô, etc.) using a stop word list [10].
In this way, each search item is tokenized and the frequency
of each token, across all 10 results is calculated to form a
(cid:3)Vb(cid:3)(cid:3)Vg(cid:3).
vector V =, where wi is the frequency
of a word corresponding to that position. For the two vectors
Vb (the search page under the IBT) and Vg (the reference, that
is, the search page of the FQND without the IBT), SEISE
calculates their Cosine distance: 1 ‚àí Vb¬∑Vg
In Figure 3(a), the distance of the vector for the IBT ‚Äòcasino‚Äô
with the reference vector is 0.97. In Figure 3(b), where the
FQDN is not compromised, we see that the vector under the
IBT ‚Äòcasino‚Äô is much closer to that of the reference, with a
distance of 0.14. In our research, we chose 0.9 as a threshold
to parameterize our system: whenever the Cosine distance
between the results of querying an FQDN under an IBT and
the reference of the FQDN goes above the threshold, the
Context Analyzer Ô¨Çags it as infected. This approach turns out
to be very effective, incurring almost no false positives, as
elaborated in Section IV.
Discussion. SEISE is carefully designed to work on search
result pages instead of the full content of individual FQDNs.
This is important because the design helps achieve not only high
performance but also high accuracy. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, a semantic
analysis on a small amount of context information (title,
URL and snippet of a search result) is certainly much more
lightweight than that on the content of each web page. Also
interestingly, focusing on such context helps avoid the noise
introduced by the generic page content, since the snippet of
each search result is exactly the text surrounding an IBT, the
part of the web page most useful for analyzing the suspicious
content it contains. In other words, our approach leverages the
search engine to zoom in on the context of the IBT, ignoring
unrelated content on the same web page.
C. IBT SET Extension
A critical issue for the semantic-based detection is how to
obtain high-quality IBTs. Those terms need to be malicious
and irrelevant to the semantics of an sTLD. Also importantly,
they should be diverse, covering not only different keywords
the adversary may use in a speciÔ¨Åc category of promotional
infections, like unlicensed pharmacy, but also those associated
with the promotional activities in different categories, such
as gambling, fake product advertising, academic cheating, etc.
Such diversity is essential for the detection coverage SEISE
is capable of achieving, since a speciÔ¨Åc type of promotional

attack (e.g., fake medicine) cannot be captured by a wrong
IBT (e.g., ‚Äògambling‚Äô).
As mentioned earlier, the seed IBT set used in our research
includes 30 terms, which were collected from several sources,
including spam trigger word lists [13], [14] and SEO competi-
tive word list [15]. These IBTs are associated with the attacks
such as blackhat SEO, fake AV and Phishing. To increase the
diversity of the set, SEISE expands it in a largely automated
way, both within one category and across different categories.
More speciÔ¨Åcally, our approach leverages NLP techniques to
gather new IBTs from the search items reported to contain
malicious content, and further cluster these IBTs to discover
new categories. Here we elaborate on this design.
Finding IBTs within a category. Once a compromised FQDN
has been identiÔ¨Åed using an IBT, the search results that lead
to the detection (for the query ‚Äúsite:FQDN+IBT‚Äù) can then
be used to Ô¨Ånd more terms within the IBT‚Äôs category. This
is because the result items are the context of the IBT, and
therefore include other bad terms related to the IBT. SpeciÔ¨Åcally,
similar to the Semantics Finder, the IBT Collector runs the term
extraction tool on each result item, including its title, URL and
snippet, to gather the terms deemed important to the context of
the IBT. Such terms are further inspected, automatically, against
the semantics of an sTLD by measuring their average distances
with the keywords of the FQDN (that is, converting each of
them into a vector using word2vec and then calculating
the Cosine distance between two vectors). Those sufÔ¨Åciently
away from the FQDN‚Äôs semantics (with a distance above the
aforementioned threshold) are selected as IBTs.
Finding new categories. Extracting keywords from the context
of an IBT can only provide us with new terms in the same
category. To detect the infections in other categories, we have to
extend the IBT set to include the terms in other types of illicit
promotions. The question is how to capture new keywords such
as ‚Äòprescription-free antibiotic‚Äô that are distinguished from the
IBTs in the known category such as ‚Äògambling‚Äô, ‚Äòcasino‚Äô, etc. A
key observation we leveraged in our study is that the adversary
sometimes compromises an FQDN to perform multiple types
of advertising: depending on the search terms the user enters,
an infected website may provide different kinds of promotional
content, for drug, alcohol, gambling and others. Further the
ads serving such a purpose are often deposited under the same
