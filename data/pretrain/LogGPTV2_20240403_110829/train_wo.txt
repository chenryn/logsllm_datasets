### Overview
The `/proc/meminfo` file can be read and written. It provides information on the number of configured huge TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) pages and their size through three variables: `hugepages_total`, `hugepages_free`, and `hugepagesize`.

### Conformance
These system calls were specific to Linux on Intel processors. However, they are now obsolete and existed only in Linux 2.5.36 through 2.5.54. The `hugetlbfs` filesystem can be used as an alternative.

### Usage
To obtain memory backed by huge pages (if the CPU supports them), use the `mmap(2)` function to map files in this virtual filesystem.

### Configuration
The maximum number of huge pages can be specified using the `hugepages=` boot parameter.

### Notes
- Requires `CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE` (under "Processor Type and Features") and `CONFIG_HUGETLBFS` (under "Filesystems").
- To mount the `hugetlbfs` filesystem:
  ```sh
  mount -t hugetlbfs hugetlbfs /huge
  ```

### frexp, frexpf, frexpl
**Synopsis:**
```c
#include <math.h>

double frexp(double x, int *exp);
float frexpf(float x, int *exp);
long double frexpl(long double x, int *exp);
```
**Link with:** `-lm`

**Feature Test Macro Requirements:**
- `frexpf()`, `frexpl()`: `_ISOC99_SOURCE` || `_POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L` || `_DEFAULT_SOURCE` (since glibc 2.19)

**Description:**
These functions convert a floating-point number to its fractional and integral components.

**Example:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <math.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    double x, r;
    int exp;
    x = strtod(argv[1], NULL);
    r = frexp(x, &exp);
    printf("frexp(%g, &e) = %g: %g * %d^%d = %g\n", x, r, r, FLT_RADIX, exp, x);
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

### pthread_mutex_consistent
**Synopsis:**
```c
#include <pthread.h>

int pthread_mutex_consistent(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
```
**Compile and link with:** `-pthread`

**Feature Test Macro Requirements:**
- `pthread_mutex_consistent()`: `_POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L`

**Description:**
This function makes a robust mutex consistent if it is in an inconsistent state. A mutex can be left in an inconsistent state if its owner terminates while holding the mutex. The next owner who acquires the mutex will succeed and be notified by a return value of `EOWNERDEAD` from a call to `pthread_mutex_lock()`.

**Return Value:**
- On success, returns 0.
- On error, returns a positive error number.

**Errors:**
- `EINVAL`: The mutex is either not robust or is not in an inconsistent state.

**Versions:**
- `pthread_mutex_consistent()` was added to glibc in version 2.12.

**Conformance:**
- POSIX.1-2008

**Notes:**
- `pthread_mutex_consistent()` informs the implementation that the state (shared data) guarded by the mutex has been restored to a consistent state.
- Before the addition of `pthread_mutex_consistent()` to POSIX, glibc defined the following equivalent nonstandard function if `_GNU_SOURCE` was defined:
  ```c
  int pthread_mutex_consistent_np(const pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
  ```
  This GNU-specific API, which first appeared in glibc 2.4, is now obsolete and should not be used in new programs. Since glibc 2.34, it has been marked as deprecated.

**Examples:**
- See `pthread_mutexattr_setrobust(3)`.

**See Also:**
- `pthread_mutex_lock(3)`
- `pthread_mutexattr_getrobust(3)`
- `pthread_mutexattr_init(3)`

### ioctl_fideduperange
**Synopsis:**
```c
#include <linux/fs.h>  // Definition of FIDEDUPERANGE and FILE_DEDUPE_* constants
#include <sys/ioctl.h>

int ioctl(int src_fd, FIDEDUPERANGE, struct file_dedupe_range *arg);
```

**Description:**
If a filesystem supports files sharing physical storage between multiple files, this `ioctl(2)` operation can be used to share some of the data in the `src_fd` file with the `dest_fd` file. Both files must reside within the same filesystem. This reduces storage consumption by allowing the filesystem to store one shared copy of the data. If a file write occurs to a shared region, the filesystem ensures that the changes remain private to the file being written ("copy on write").

**Structure:**
```c
struct file_dedupe_range {
    __u64 src_offset;
    __u64 src_length;
    __u16 dest_count;
    __u16 reserved1;
    __u32 reserved2;
    struct file_dedupe_range_info info[0];
};

struct file_dedupe_range_info {
    __s64 dest_fd;
    __u64 dest_offset;
    __u64 bytes_deduped;
    __s32 status;
    __u32 reserved;
};
```

**Fields:**
- `reserved1` and `reserved2` must be zero.
- `dest_count` specifies the number of destinations.
- `bytes_deduped` and `status` are set upon successful completion.

**Return Value:**
- On error, returns -1 and sets `errno` to indicate the error.

**Errors:**
- `EBADF`: `src_fd` is not open for reading, `dest_fd` is not open for writing, or the filesystem does not support deduplication.
- `EINVAL`: The filesystem does not support deduplicating the ranges of the given files.
- `EISDIR`: One of the files is a directory and the filesystem does not support shared regions in directories.
- `ENOMEM`: Insufficient memory to perform the operation.
- `EOPNOTSUPP`: The filesystem does not support deduplicating either file descriptor.
- `EPERM`: `dest_fd` is immutable.
- `ETXTBSY`: One of the files is a swap file.
- `EXDEV`: `dest_fd` and `src_fd` are not on the same mounted filesystem.

**Versions:**
- This `ioctl` operation first appeared in Linux 4.5. It was previously known as `BTRFS_IOC_FILE_EXTENT_SAME` and was private to Btrfs.

**Conformance:**
- This API is Linux-specific.

**Notes:**
- `fallocate(2)` may unshare shared blocks to guarantee subsequent writes do not fail due to lack of disk space.
- Some filesystems may limit the amount of data that can be deduplicated in a single call.

**See Also:**
- `ioctl(2)`
