Typically .env these files are small and manageable, but there are times when
you run into situations where you duplicate the same data within the file.
Here is an example:
MAIL_USERNAME=PI:EMAIL  
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=PI:EMAIL
The dotenv package that Laravel relies on can use variables with other defined
variables in this same file. For example:
MAIL_USERNAME=PI:EMAIL  
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=${MAIL_USERNAME}
This simple trick allows you not to repeat yourself and can be useful when you
have multiple services requiring the same piece of data.
I tried using this with the deno dotenv package and the deno standard library
for env files and both parsers don't pick up the variable, intead the console
log value in the MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS example above would be just
${MAIL_USERNAME} instead of hello@laravel-news.com.
