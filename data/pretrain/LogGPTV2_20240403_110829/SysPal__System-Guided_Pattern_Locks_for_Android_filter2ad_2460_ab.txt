### Pattern Recall Test and Notification System

Participants were invited to a series of pattern recall tests. Steps 5 and 6 were repeated after 15 minutes for the second recall test and again after 24 hours for the third recall test. To ensure participants were reminded of these subsequent tests, our Android application was designed to send vibration notifications at the appropriate times. Additionally, each participant received an email 24 hours after completing the second recall test, inviting them to the third recall test.

The intervals of 15 minutes and 24 hours were chosen to reflect real-world smartphone usage patterns. According to [14], the average daily number of interactions with smartphones is 57 times, which translates to a mean break duration of about 15 minutes between unlock sessions, assuming a 14-hour daytime period. A 24-hour interval was also used, based on the assumption that users would unlock their devices at least once a day, even during vacations.

To prevent cheating, the screen capture feature was disabled in our application. Before conducting the main study, several pilot studies involving 1,118 participants were conducted to identify and fix bugs, as well as to clarify instructions and descriptions.

### Data Collected

Throughout the user study, the following information was recorded:

- **Selected Pattern and Policy:** The selected pattern and the assigned pattern policy for each participant.
- **Number of Initialization Attempts:** The number of times each participant tried to reset the grid during pattern setup.
- **Number of Unlock Attempts:** The number of attempts made by each participant to draw the selected pattern across all three recall tests.
- **Time for Pattern Setup:** The time taken from the first view of the pattern screen until the successful selection of a pattern.
- **Time for Authentication:** The time taken to complete an authentication attempt, from the first touch on the login screen until the correct pattern was drawn or the attempt failed.
- **Pattern Recall Results:** The results of each recall test, indicating whether the correct pattern was entered.
- **Survey Answers:** Participants' responses to the survey questions listed in Table II.

### Survey Questions

| Q1 | Did you use an external storage (e.g., a sheet of paper or a text file) to write down your pattern? | Yes/No |
|----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Q2 | How difficult was it for you to remember your pattern?                                             | Likert scale: "very difficult," "difficult," "neutral," "easy," "very easy" |
| Q3 | Did you use any special technique (e.g., creating character patterns, forming dictionary words) to help you create and remember your pattern? | Yes/No |
| Q4 | If you answered "Yes" to Q3, what was the special technique that you used?                         | Open-ended |

### Mechanical Turk Recruitment

To conduct a large-scale study, we used Amazon Mechanical Turk to recruit a sufficient number of participants. Participants had to be located in the United States and at least 18 years old. Those who completed the first and second recall tests were rewarded with $1.50, and those who completed the third recall test received an additional $0.50.

### Statistical Tests

We performed Fisher’s Exact Test (FET) to compare the proportion of cracked patterns, starting/end/overall points, and pattern recall success rates across the five policies in Table I. For normally distributed data (tested by Shapiro-Wilk’s test), we used a two-tailed unpaired t-test to compare pattern setup time, authentication time, and the number of attempts. The recall difficulty was tested using the unpaired Mann-Whitney U test (MW U test) due to the skewed distribution of Likert scale responses. Post-hoc comparisons were corrected for multiple testing using the Bonferroni correction when appropriate.

### Usability Results

#### Demographics

A total of 1,717 participants completed the first pattern recall test, 1,603 returned for the second test, and 1,236 completed the third test. Most participants were white (71%), with the majority in the 18–29 (61%) and 30–39 (29%) age groups. About 51% were male, 54% had a university degree, and 37% had a high school diploma. Detailed demographics are provided in Table XIII (see Appendix A).

#### External Storage Usage

After each pattern recall test, participants were asked about the use of external storage (Q1 in Table II). Only 44 participants used external storage for at least one of the tests, with 54.5% of them assigned to the Random policy. Most (84.1%) used a piece of paper. These participants' records were discarded to accurately measure the pattern recall success rate. All participants were paid regardless of their answer to this question.

#### Recall Success Rate

We analyzed the number of participants who successfully recalled their pattern in the three recall tests to compare the effects of the five policies in Table I.

1. **Survival Rates:**
   - **First Test:** The recall success rate for the SysPal policies (98.16–99.42%) and Original policy (99.48%) was significantly higher than the Random policy (82.63%) (all p < 0.001, corrected FET).
   - **Second Test:** The recall success rate difference increased, with SysPal policies (95.71–95.77%) and Original policy (95.05%) showing significant superiority over the Random policy (79.34%) (all p < 0.001, corrected FET).
   - **Third Test:** The recall success rate further increased, with SysPal policies (70.09–73.68%) and Original policy (72.40%) demonstrating significant superiority over the Random policy (50.60%) (all p < 0.001, corrected FET).

2. **Excluding Dropouts:**
   - **First Two Tests:** Similar survival rates were observed across all policies.
   - **Third Test:** The recall success rate for the Random policy (60.79%) was significantly lower than all other policies (94.31–96.19%).

For all three tests, no statistically significant difference in recall success rate was found between the Original and all SysPal policies. However, all policies showed significant superiority over the Random policy (all p < 0.001, corrected FET).

#### Authentication Time and Attempts

We measured the authentication time by adding the preparation time (time until the first touch) and the input time (time from the first touch until the device is unlocked). Table V shows the mean time taken to complete the authentication process for all three recall tests. Appendix B provides a visual comparison of authentication times between all policies.

| Policy | First Test (μ, σ) | Second Test (μ, σ) | Third Test (μ, σ) |
|--------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Original | 3.56, 4.60 | 3.64, 4.73 | - |
| 1-Point | 4.26, 2.76 | 4.07, - | - |
| 2-Point | 2.94, 4.17 | - | - |
| 3-Point | 4.30, 4.47 | - | - |
| Random | 12.90, 10.70 | - | - |
