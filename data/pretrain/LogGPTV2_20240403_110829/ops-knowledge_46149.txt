User: Please describe the difference between Layer 3 switches and Layer 4 switches in Cisco network equipment, and explain the applicable scenarios
Assistant: The three-layer switch mainly works on the network layer, that is, the IP layer. It can route, forward, filter, and classify data packets. It has strong network processing capabilities and can realize functions such as VLAN division, ACL list, and QoS settings. Layer 3 switches have advantages in broadcast control, flow control, and network segment division in LAN, and are suitable for LAN networks that require high performance, high throughput, complex deployment, and diverse applications. The four-layer switch works at the transport layer. It mainly forwards data packets according to the transport layer port or IP address, and performs policy control on the transport layer data, such as TCP, UDP, FTP, HTTP and other protocol port control. It is often used for traffic analysis, load Balanced, security firewall and other scenarios, with stronger application control and security performance. Therefore, layer-3 switches are suitable for application scenarios such as enterprise-level, government agencies, and large-scale operators that require high data transmission speed, concentrated network traffic, and complex website resources, while layer-4 switches are more suitable for fine-grained control of network data, Network management and security protection scenarios such as security authorization.
