used to sense the ambient environment, the attacker can use a piece
of clothing to wrap around the terminal to easily create the same
dark ambient environment. Second, these solutions are generally
designed for the scenario that the card and the reader are located
in two remote locations with distinct environments, and therefore
would not work when the devices are located in the same place,
e.g., in an mPoS-based passive attack.
Comparison. OPay is a new orientation-based solution that
does not require an explicit user action nor depends on the ambient
environment. The user action involved in the payment is implicit
and has been seamlessly integrated into a natural payment process.
Therefore, it preserves the existing usage model. Table 4 compares
OPay with related works. As compared to other solutions, OPay is
reasonably fast, taking only 0.228 seconds in our prototype. The
error rates (FRR = 4.76%, FAR = 0.96% for the random guessing
attack and FAR = 15.24% for the target guessing attack) present a
reasonable trade-off in security and usability. It substantially re-
duces the chance of a successful attack with little inconvenience to
users in a legitimate transaction. Some other works report better
error rates than ours. However, we should highlight that a direct
comparison of the error rates may not be appropriate since the
test conditions are different. As an example, in Czeskis et al. [5],
although the authors reported 0% FRR and 0% FAR, their user study
involved only three participants, and all three participants were
trained to practice a certain handshake before starting the experi-
ments. In our user study, none of the twenty participants had any
prior training on how to use OPay. They were asked to make a
simulated contactless payment as they would normally do in a real-
life transaction. In general, ambient environment-based solutions
preserve the existing usage model but are not effective when the
attacker’s device and the victim’s card have the same or similar
environment, or share the same location. Solutions based on user
activation can prevent the same environment/location attacks but
change the existing usage model. To our best knowledge, OPay
is the first solution that protects not only PR attacks but also MP
attacks where the attacker is in the same environment or location
as the victim, while preserving the existing usage model.
6 DISCUSSION
Feasibility of adding sensors: As shown in Table 4, using sensors
is common in the proposed solutions to prevent passive attacks in
contactless payments. The main research question pursued in this
paper is to identify which set of sensors we should use to prevent
attacks without changing the existing usage model. We note that
some commercialized bank cards have already been equipped with
sensors, e.g., fingerprint sensor in Mastercard Biometric Card7,
which shows the feasibility of embedding sensors on bank cards.
(However, note that the Master Biometric card requires the user to
press the fingerprint sensor to make a payment, hence changing
the existing usage model.)

Usability: SUS is a widely used framework to assess users’ sat-
isfaction with the usability of computer systems [3]. It has been
used in previous studies [19, 20] to compare the usability among
similar systems for pairing. We chose SUS over other usability tests
such as Single Ease Question (SEQ) in order to establish a compa-
rable benchmark for the usability of contactless payment systems.
In our user study, we decided to use the original SUS questions
without modification [3]. Users generally found the questions easy
to understand. However, some users were puzzled by the word
“inconsistency” in Q6 and “cumbersome” in Q8 (see Table 3), which
shows a limitation of using SUS in our usability study. However, it
is well-known that SUS questions are phrased for general purposes,
and in a specific context, users may occasionally find the wording
of some questions to not fit exactly [3].
Extension: In future, we plan to investigate the feasibility of
using OPay for wearable payment devices such as NFC-enabled
jewellery and key fobs that are vulnerable to both PR and MP
attacks. Applying OPay to these devices requires some adaptation
of the definition of orientation for each device as the usage model
varies with different payment devices.
7 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed OPay, a novel orientation-based solution
to prevent both passive replay attacks and mPoS-based passive
attacks against contactless payment devices. We built a concrete
prototype and conducted a user study to evaluate its feasibility. The
users generally found our solution as easy-to-use as in a normal
contactless payment experience; it was sufficiently fast, taking only
0.228 second; it substantially reduced the attack success rate from
the currently 100% to between 1-15% with only a small 4.76% false
rejection rate. These make OPay a useful solution to fight against
fraud in contactless payment systems.
