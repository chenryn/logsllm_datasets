Slider does not update self state value if min, max, value props are changed
together, so slider gets out of the page layout.

  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
When I change the slider props, I believe that the slider accepts new props,
updates its state and re renders properly.
## Current Behavior
If I change min, max, value props together, slider does not update value.

  1. Set slider props - value: 5, minValue: 1, maxValue: 10, step: 1

  3. See that slider's value did not change
## Context
I've got slider as a part of big component, that present a service calculator.
User can switch different mode, so the slider must change it props.
