Certainly! Here is a more structured and professional version of the log entry:

```
Timestamp: 10.30 17:15:42
Program: QQ.exe
Destination: tcpconn6.tencent.com:443
Error: Connection request was canceled before completion.
```

This format clearly separates the key elements, making it easier to read and understand.
