User: Analyze why this error occurs when the container starts for the first time, and provide a solution
Assistant: Because the database connection parameters and the corresponding database instance required for the container to run are not provided, the container cannot connect to the database when it starts, so a connection timeout error occurs. The solution is to provide the correct database connection information and corresponding database instance when the container starts. You can pack the database connection parameters and instance information into a configuration file, and then mount the configuration file into the container and read the parameters when the container starts. In addition, you can also set some default parameters inside the container, so that the default values are used when the user does not provide a configuration file.
