# 19｜全篇通读（下）：并非所有文章和书籍都值得从头到尾阅读

大家好，我是陈亦峰。欢迎与我一同学习英语。今天我们继续探讨《Breaking through Three Common Engineering Myths》这篇文章。首先，我们简要回顾上半部分的内容，然后继续快速浏览剩余的部分。

在这篇文章中，作者指出了针对软件工程师的三种普遍存在的刻板印象或成见，并强调这些成见是有害的，必须通过转变观念来打破。作者逐一分析了这三个谬误。第一个是“软件工程师不擅长沟通”，因为软件工程师大多内向，而内向者被认为不善于交流。然而，内向与外向的性格并不必然决定一个人是否善于沟通，尽管良好的沟通技巧对于幸福健康的生活至关重要。接着，作者介绍了两种沟通技能——倾听和简化复杂问题，并提供了相应的练习方法。

接下来，我们将探讨另外两个错误观念：“软件工程师天生不适合做领导”以及“软件工程师过于注重逻辑而不具备创造力”。

在下面的文章内容中，黑体字部分（标题）和斜体字部分（引用）均来自原文，橙色标记为我个人认为重要的地方。我们可以预见，后面两条“神话”的结构应该与前一部分相似。每个大标题后会有两段论述，作者会指出刻板印象中的谬误之处。让我们先来看首句。

> **Myth: Engineers Don't Make "Natural" Leaders**
>
> [This myth follows an even more generalized myth that leaders are born, not made. Research on leadership development suggests that this simply is not true, and in fact, 70 percent of leadership ability is the result of lessons learned through life experiences.]
>
> [A foundational concept of leadership development is often referred to as "leadership readiness". It is a belief inside someone that they are truly ready, willing, and able to become a leader. People who believe this about themselves can develop much more quickly, and this isn't surprising. This idea is very much in-line with other research done by Carol Dweck about having a "growth" mindset versus a "fixed" mindset so that we believe we can continue to develop and change throughout our lives.]

第一段首句说，“这一谬论基于另一个更广泛的谬论，即领导者是天生的，而不是后天培养的。”第二段首句说，“领导力发展的基础在于心理上是否做好了成为领导者的准备”。这实际上反驳了前一段的观点。与“沟通能力”部分一样，作者随后提出了两条训练“领导力”的方法。第一条是“评估自己的优势”。

> **Assess Your Strengths**
>
> [One of the ways to discover that we are capable of leadership is to identify the strengths that we have and find ways to utilize them. There are a lot of free and paid assessments out there, such as Clifton Strengths by Gallup to help you do this, but a very simple approach is to ask people who know you well.]
>
> [Go ahead -- ask the ten people in your life who know you better than anyone else what they think your top three personal strengths are. Likely, you will agree with a lot of what they say. They may also share with you things that you don't currently believe about yourself, but because others are suggesting it, you may start to believe a little bit more.]
>
> [Crushing Limiting Belief Activity: This may seem a bit weird, but stay with me. Take about five minutes and jot down a quick list of what you consider to be your weaknesses. Then grab a piece of paper or note card and write down each of those "weaknesses" that you identified that is actually a limiting belief. Take that paper with the list of limiting beliefs and rip it up. Throw it into the air. Make a mess. Show those beliefs you don't accept them. For example, my weakness might be that I tend to suppress my emotions which can lead to less connection in my relationships. A limiting belief I used to accept was that I was not a good writer. You may or may not agree with that, but at least I am pushing through and practicing my skills! I would write that on a note card and rip it up. I promise, it feels good.]

“限制性信念”指的是那些阻碍个人发展的错误信念，如“我这辈子没有发财的命”、“每次作报告都会紧张到忘记说什么”等消极想法。这个活动旨在通过某种方式打破这些限制性信念。第二条训练“领导力”的方法是“反求诸己”，即遇到挫折时不要责怪他人，而是反省自身，找出问题所在并努力改正。

> **Look Inside**
>
> [The fact of the matter is that people rarely make huge changes in their lives, but people do change. It happens when we can increase self-awareness and have "ah-ha" moments or epiphanies that help us see ourselves and our situations in a new light. That's really how we change our mindsets, which then drives our behaviors in new ways.]
>
> [I've seen people who were so bent on blaming others that they became so toxic and were about to be fired. Yet they were able to create just enough space to realize they were part of the problem and began focusing on what they could change, rather than blaming everyone else. It's transformational.]
>
> [Mindset Adjustment Activity: Identify the largest work challenge you are facing right now. Write down what you think the root cause of the problem is. Then, write down 2-3 things you can do personally to make things better (this is not about you taking action to fix other people -- focus on you). Then, stay focused on your own ability to help the cause rather than what others are/aren't doing.]

第一段首句说，“人们很少在生活中做出巨大改变，但确实会发生变化。”第二段首句说，“我见过一些人总是指责别人，以至于变得非常负面，几乎要被解雇。”结合小标题“反求诸己”，这两段讨论了从指责他人到自我反省的转变。接下来是“心态调整活动”，旨在帮助人们从外部找原因转变为从自己身上找原因，这也是培养领导力的重要方面。

第三个谬误是“工程师只讲逻辑、没有创造力”。看到这里，我们已经比较熟悉作者的写作套路了。

> **Myth: Engineers Are Very Logical and Not Creative**
>
> [This one seems to make sense -- if engineers were creative, wouldn't they have decided to be artists, writers, or some other "Fine Arts" profession? Wrong! The key word in being creative is right there -- to create! Engineers create products, services, and processes that influence people every day. Whether your work goes into consumer applications, devices, or machines, the end product of engineering work is used by other people. If engineers suppressed their creativity, they would miss out on a lot of insights into ways to solve problems than they otherwise would.]
>
> [Every day, engineers need to find new ways to think outside the box to tackle new challenges. They have the fabulous opportunity and responsibility of imagining ways in which the world could be different and then creating ways to make that happen. That is at the heart of what creativity is all about and it should be inspiring and exciting for engineers. For example, engineering innovations have been a big part of healthcare improvement over the years. From data analysis to efficient software systems, to surgery machines, to providing treatment tracking and recommendations, engineering truly saves lives daily.]

第一段首句说，“这个似乎有点道理。如果工程师有创意，他们不是应该去做艺术家、作家或其他创意类工作吗？错！”第二段首句说，“每天，工程师们都需要找到新的思维方式，跳出固有的框框来应对新的挑战。”这部分依然驳斥谬误并提出破除谬论的方法。接下来，作者提出了两条训练“创造力”的方法。

> **Get Curious**
>
> [When we suppress creativity it's often because we feel like we already have the right answers or approaches to solve the problems we face. Yet different people and their perspectives can see things in completely different ways. This is good!]
>
> [One way to start considering creative ideas and not getting set in our ways is to get curious. If someone disagrees with you, get curious about why and how they are feeling about the issue. If someone comes to you with a problem, spend a bit more time asking questions about the issue before you rush into providing a solution. Curiosity can open our minds to new ideas while continuing to embrace the rational thinking that engineers value so much.]
>
> [Curiosity Activity: Utilize "Yes, and..." The next time you have a brainstorming session with a team, I want you to do everything in your power to promote ideas and open-minded thinking. Eliminate from your vocabulary responses such as "no," "I don't think that will work," or "yes, but..." When someone suggests an idea, remain open to it by responding with "yes, and [expand upon the idea]." This principle comes from the world of improv comedy and is taught heavily in the world of design thinking, and has the ability to keep teams positive and supportive to promote collaboration.]

第一条是“培养好奇心”。小标题下有两段论述和一个“训练活动”。第一段首句说，“我们压抑创造力，往往是因为我们认为自己已经有了正确的答案或方法来解决问题。”第二段首句说，“开始创新、打破陈规的方法之一就是培养好奇心。”接下来是作者提供的一个培养好奇心的“训练活动”。

第二条培养“创造力”的方法是“拥抱失败”。

> **Embrace Failure and Try Again**
>
> [The struggle with creation is that we often "fail," and this fear of failure can keep us from exploring different approaches or possibilities. Consider this quote: "Failure is central to engineering. Every engineer before being successful has failed many times. Before being successful, you must be brave enough to fail." - Richard G. Scott]
>
> [Instead of being afraid of providing failing solutions and ideas, we should look at each failure as an opportunity to learn something new. It's a new data point. It's a new experience. And if we are good learners, we won't make the same mistake again. Indeed, failing fast is often the best way to succeed if we stick with it and treat each failure as a learning experience.]
>
> [Overcoming Fear Activity: Create something you've always wanted to but which is outside of your comfort zone. Just try it. If it means writing code in a different language, do that. It may mean that you want to create something physical using your hands, such as a drawing, painting, or a small construction project. The point here is to do something that you haven't done before and to realize that at your core, you truly are a creator. Personally, I have recently started creating videos for my own marketing efforts. I've never done that before and it's very uncomfortable, but I've received helpful feedback and learned a lot through the process.]

这两段的主题句分别是“创新伴随着失败，对失败的恐惧会让我们不敢去探索新的方法或可能性”和“我们应该把每一次失败看成是学习新东西的机会”。观点和逻辑都非常清晰，之后是一个“克服恐惧”的“训练活动”。

最后一部分的小标题是“展望未来”，这是全文的总结。

> **Moving Forward**
>
> [Myths, stereotypes, and limiting beliefs can be really damaging to our success. It's important to know that those things don't have to define you, and who you think you are and can vastly change as you let go of damaging beliefs and embrace new ways of thinking for the future. Another favorite quote: "To reach a goal, you must first believe in yourself. Only then can you truly achieve anything." - Richelle E. Goodrich]
>
> [If you currently suffer from accepting or giving in to these myths and stereotypes, the time to change that is right now. It is going to take some action and a change in mindset, but it's very possible. Rather than believing the myths shared above, I want to share three truths about engineers you should accept instead:]
>
> [1. Engineers can develop exceptional communication skills (if they don't already have them)]
>
> [2. Engineers have the capacity to become great leaders (as many already are)]
>
> [3. Successful engineers are creative (just look at what they create!)]
>
> [Take the actions suggested in the solutions and practice activities and see what happens. You might be surprised at what you're capable of.]

“神话、成见和限制性信念都会对我们的成功造成伤害。”“现在就是改变的时候了。”“我想分享三个你应该接受的关于软件工程师的真相”：
1. 工程师可以培养出卓越的沟通能力（如果他们尚不具备这些能力的话）；
2. 工程师有能力成为伟大的领导者（很多人已经成为伟大的领导者）；
3. 成功的工程师是有创造力的（看看他们创造的东西就知道了）。

最后，作者希望“按照建议的解决方案和实践活动采取行动”，看看会发生什么。

### 小结
在粗略阅读的过程中，我们可以在不打断阅读节奏的情况下，适当地在笔记本上画一个简单的提纲。全篇略读完成之后，我们就可以比较清楚地看到文章的总体结构。这篇文章采用了较为规范的“总分总”结构。作者在总起部分开门见山提出论点，指出“普遍存在的三个针对软件工程师的错误成见是非常有害的，必须采取行动打破这三个成见”。接下来是三个并列关系的分论点。作者对这三种针对软件工程师的错误“成见”逐一阐述，首先陈述谬误的观点，然后进行反驳，进而提出解决方案，并提供“训练活动”来实践每一个解决方案。最后，作者进行收尾总结，再次重申这些“神话”或“成见”的破坏性，提出三个真相来呼应开头提出的三个“成见”，并呼吁读者采取行动，实现改变。

可以说，并非所有的文章或书籍都值得我们花时间从头到尾、一字一句地读完。在我们投入宝贵的时间资源之前，**我们需要以最少的投入、用比较高效的方式来判断两件事：作者的语言质量（文笔、风格等）和思想内容（信息、观点等）是否值得我们投入更多的时间和精力。**因此，对于每一个希望提高自学效率的终身学习者来说，都需要有一套具有成本效益的阅读策略。
