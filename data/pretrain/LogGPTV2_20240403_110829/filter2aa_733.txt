Strategic Threat Agents 
• 6000 PSAPs taking a combined 
660,000 calls per day 
• Fundamental building block of 
our collective security 
• Potential damage extends beyond 
individual people not being able 
to talk to 911 
Solutions 
•
Call-routing red flags 
•
Call “captchas” 
•
PSAP security 
standardizations 
•
Increased budgets for 
security services
