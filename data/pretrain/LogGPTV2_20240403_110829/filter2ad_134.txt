This workshop addresses the technical challenges arising from
our current interconnected society. Multitudes of devices and
people can be connected to each other by intelligent algo-
rithms, apps, social networks, and the infrastructure set by
Internet of Things (IoT). As more people and their devices
are connected without much restriction, the issues of security,
privacy, and trust remain a challenge. Multimedia in IoT
services should provide a robust and resilient security plat-
forms and solutions against any unauthorized access. Recent
literature shows increased concerns about hacking, security
breaches, data manipulation, social engineering, and new
attack methods. Malware can be hidden within multimedia
files and visiting infected websites can trigger its download to
victims machines. There are a multitude of techniques to steal
personal information and other sensitive media for unautho-
rized dissemination; imposters/identity thefts are common
in social networks. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness
of resilient security and privacy solutions, methods such as
new standards, advance cryptography, improved algorithms
for intrusion detection, personalized privacy, and isolation of
questionable or malicious files can be used independently or
all together to minimize the threats.
Multimedia has expanded beyond the scope its original
definition. With the rise of social media, large quantities of
multimedia (e.g., pictures, videos, data, analytics and per-
sonal information) can be created in a short period of time.
When all these data are stored in a cloud environment, many
people can connect to these services for viewing, sharing,
commenting, and storing information. IoT represents a collec-
tion of devices, platforms, and software that allow people to
store and share data in the cloud and also connects different

types of clouds altogether. Hence, multimedia in the IoT
serves a significant purpose as many peoples updates, status,
locations, and live actions can be seen, disseminated, tracked,
commented on, and monitored in near real time. IoT opens
up many possibilities since more people can broadcast them-
selves and allow their networks to view and share in their
lives. There are also increased fraudulent activities, cyber-
crimes, unauthorized access, malicious attacks, phishing, and
impersonating/stealing identities. This presents challenges
for existing areas such as access control, authentication, data
leakage, permission, social engineering, denial of service, and
identity management for the attackers to impose identity,
steal information, and manipulate data in the IoT environ-
ment. Challenges also include new problems such as large
scale attacks and prevention, the strength of security protec-
tion (e.g., common encryption algorithms), hiding malware
with multimedia, location-based privacy with high accuracy
and anonymity, underground criminal networks, and hidden
security breaches.
Our workshopl, The 1st International Workshop on Mul-
timedia Privacy and Security (MPS), as part of CCS 2017,
focuses on these concerns, specific to the IoT ecosystem.
We solicited submissions on new and innovative methods,
techniques, and proofsofconcepts supported by strong the-
ory/algorithms and simulation/experiments to submit papers
for this workshop. We accepted 5 submissions, and organized
the workshop around talks for these publications with a
keynote from Dr. Jeremy Epstein of the NSF and a panel
discussion. Accepted papers include:
(1) “Unwinding Ariadne’s Identity Thread: Privacy Risks
with Fitness Trackers and Online Social Networks” by
Angeliki Aktypi, Jason Nurse, and Michael Goldsmith
(University of Oxford, UK)
(2) “A Study on Autoencoder-based Reconstruction Method
for Wi-Fi Location Data with Erasures” by Tetsushi
Ohki (Shizuoka University, Japan) and Akira Otsuka
(Institute of Information Technology, Japan)
(3) “Attacking Automatic Video Analysis Algorithms: A
Case Study of Google Cloud Video Intelligence API”
by Hossein Hosseini, Baicen Xiao, and Radha Pooven-
dran (University of Washington, USA), Andrew Clark

versity, USA), Mike Rosulek and Rakesh B. Bobba
