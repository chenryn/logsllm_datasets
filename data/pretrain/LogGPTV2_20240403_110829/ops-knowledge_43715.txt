User: Now there is a Java Web application, and a functional module needs to be added. Please list the steps you need to do, including modifying code, testing and deploying.
Assistant: 1. Analyze requirements: According to the requirements of functional modules, analyze which codes need to be added and which parts should be modified. 2. Write code: According to the requirements, write new codes and modify the old codes to meet the new requirements. 3. Unit test: Unit test the modified code to ensure the correctness and reliability of the code. 4. Integration testing: Conduct integration testing to test the compatibility and interaction between new functional modules and existing code. 5. Functional test: Carry out functional test to test whether the new functional module can operate normally according to the requirements. 6. Deployment test environment: conduct a deployment test in the test environment to check whether the deployment of new functional modules is successful. 7. System test: conduct system test to test whether the whole system can operate as expected, and check whether the new functional modules have any impact. 8. Deploy the production environment: Deploy the new functional modules to the production environment to ensure the normal operation of the production environment. 9. Test the production environment: test whether the new functional modules in the production environment are running normally. 10. Acceptance test: Acceptance test is carried out by relevant parties to test whether the new functional module meets the requirements and expectations.
