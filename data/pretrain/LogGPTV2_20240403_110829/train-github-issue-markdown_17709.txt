### Description
Modify the batch indexing task ID generation logic from
`__timestamp` to  
`__`  
This would impact native index tasks as well as hadoop index tasks.
### Motivation
With the existing task naming convention, if there are multiple indexing tasks
submitted at the same time for a datasource, only one of the tasks gets
accepted and the remaining tasks fail with `Task[xxx] already exists`. I'd
like to modify the naming convention to the one mentioned above, so that this
issue can be avoided.  
@jihoonson Any comments regarding this?
