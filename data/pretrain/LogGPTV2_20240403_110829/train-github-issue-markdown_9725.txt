**Platform:** Windows 32-bit, Python 2.6 binary installer from python.org, numpy binary installer (versions specified), and MinGW32 compiler (specified in `distutils.cfg`).

When using `easy_install ffnet`, the installation is successful with NumPy 1.6.2. However, with NumPy 1.7.0, the installation fails, raising a `SandboxViolation` error:

```
Wrote C/API module "_pikaia" to file "build\src.win32-2.6\ffnet\fortran_pikaiamodule.c"
Fortran 77 wrappers are saved to "build\src.win32-2.6\ffnet\fortran_pikaia-f2pywrappers.f"
error: Setup script exited with error: SandboxViolation: open('C:\Python26\libs\libmsvcr90.def', 'w') {}
```

I am aware that distribution and setup tools can be somewhat trendy, but I have not encountered any information suggesting that `numpy.distutils` is now incompatible with `easy_install` (as `ffnet` still recommends using `easy_install` for installation).
