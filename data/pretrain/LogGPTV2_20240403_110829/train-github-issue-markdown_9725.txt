Platform: win32, python 2.6 binary installer from python.org, numpy binary
installer of versions given, mingw32 compiler (specified in distutils.cfg)
"easy_install ffnet" works fine with numpy 1.6.2; with numpy 1.7.0, it raises
a SandboxViolation:
> Wrote C/API module "_pikaia" to file
> "build\src.win32-2.6\ffnet\fortran_pikaiamodule.c"

I know distribution/setup tools are a little flavour-of-the-month, but I
haven't seen a call that numpy.distutils is incompatible with easy_install now
(ffnet still recommends easy_install).
