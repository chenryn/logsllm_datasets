We are currently using Jest to run Playwright test cases, and the following code works perfectly for us:

```typescript
import { runCLI } from "jest";

const { results } = await runCLI(
  {
    $0: "",
    config: jestConfigPath,
    ...options,
    _: testNamePatterns,
  },
  [integrationTestsPackagePath]
);
```

This setup allows us to get the test results and determine the next steps for the test run. However, we would like to transition to using the `playwright-test-runner`.

To achieve this, we need to dynamically generate a `playwright.config.ts` file at runtime and then run the Playwright test cases using a similar command structure as above, but with the `playwright-test-runner`.

Specifically, we want to expose the following line of code (line #154 in `playwright/src/test/cli.ts`):

```typescript
const result = await runner.run(!!opts.list, filePatternFilters, opts.project || undefined);
```

This function should be made available so that we can use it in our TypeScript code to run Playwright test cases with the `playwright-test-runner`.
