We are currently using Jest for running playwright test cases. So this code is
working perfectly fine for us:
    import { runCLI } from "jest";
     const { results } = await runCLI(
          {
            $0: "",
            config: jestConfigPath,
            ...options,
            _: testNamePatterns,
          },
          [integrationTestsPackagePath]
        );
We are getting test results and we can decide the next steps for test run.  
We would like to switch to playwright-test-runner.  
We would like to create playwright.config.ts on runtime and then run
playwright tests cases using similar command above for playwright test runner.
What we want is to somehow expose this line of code (#154):
const result = await runner.run(!!opts.list, filePatternFilters, opts.project
|| undefined);
playwright/src/test/cli.ts
Line 154 in eafba43
|  async function runTests(args: string[], opts: { [key: string]: any }) {

This function should be exposed so that we can consume it in our Typescript
code to run playwright test cases using playwright test runner.
