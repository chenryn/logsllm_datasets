User: I seem to be in a never ending tail spin of Linux, or not, Windows or not. Web programming or system programming. Python or PHP.
I'am self teaching myself programming. But it seems I keep being torn about which way to go. Unfortunately it is always seemingly good reasons to get side tracked. You know the whole open source or proprietary thing. Lately I have decided after a year that Linux just doesn't cut it for me and it mostly stems from me wanting to watch videos on Channel 9 etc, and the clunkiness that is Linux. So that lead me to, "Should I learn ASP.NET, since I am more so deciding Windows IS a "necessary" evil.
I hope this made sense. The reason I settled in on Web Development as my course to learning programming is because I actually have a task to implement rather then aimlessly reading reference books etc.
Does anyone have any advice at what they may have done to stay focused and not get lead down every tangent or idea.
Assistant: You will only have a first language for a little while. Pick any direction that interests you, and follow it. There is no way around the introduction "Drink from the Firehose" experience.
Keep early project simple, and tangible. Build useful things and the motivation will be there.
Web / desktop / mobile / etc, its all good. Find the one that gets you thinking about code when your not coding, and you'll know your going in the right direction.
