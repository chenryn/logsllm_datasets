**Question: Retention of SharePoint Usage Analysis Log Files**

Our current SharePoint installation has accumulated 30GB of usage analysis log files, dating back approximately six months. I have configured SharePoint to process the usage analysis data nightly. Given this, I am questioning whether it is necessary to retain these log files for such an extended period.

SharePoint does not appear to automatically clean up these log files. Six months ago, I had to manually clear out the logs due to disk space issues.

My specific questions are:
1. Do I need to retain these log files to generate accurate and comprehensive usage analysis reports?
2. Can I delete the log files immediately after the nightly usage analysis processing completes?

Additionally, I am considering compressing the log files using 7-Zip to conserve disk space. Would this approach be effective, or might it impact the usage analysis in any way?
