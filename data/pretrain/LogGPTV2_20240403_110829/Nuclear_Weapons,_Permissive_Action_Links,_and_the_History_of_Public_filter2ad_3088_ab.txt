subordinate  military  commander  or  NATO  member  state  would  request
approval from the Defence  Planning Committee through the NATO Military
Committee.14 This request  would  then  be  forwarded  to the  United  States
or  Britain,  depending  on  which  country's  weapons  were  requested.
Since  the  beginning  of  the  nuclear  age,  the  United  States  and  Britain
have co-operated  very closely in the development  of nuclear weapons  and
their delivery systems. It is not surprising then that British nuclear weapons
control  technology  and  policies  are  very  similar  to  those  of  the  United
States. As indicated earlier in this article, the sea-launched ballistic missiles
(SLBM) deployed in US submarines are not equipped with permissive action
links;  neither  are  those  in  British  submarines.  According  to  Professor
Lawrence  Freedman,  the  British  Polaris submarine  commander  (with  at
least one other officer  in keeping with the two-man rule) is'.  .  . capable of
launching  [Polaris] missiles  of  [his]  own  volition'.  The  commander  is
authorized  to  do  this  only  if  he  believes  '.  .  . that  Britain  has  been
destroyed  by a nuclear  attack  and no responsible  person  is in a position  to
transmit  orders'.15

President's  Committee  on  Nuclear  Proliferation  (also  known  as  the
Gilpatric  Committee)  made  its  report.  In  the  section  on  the  physical
security  of  nuclear  weapons,  the  committee  recommended  the  following:
Intensified  research  to  develop  improved  safeguards  against  seizure  or
unauthorized  use should be continued.  We should consider  appropriate
assistance  to  the  United  Kingdom,  France  and  the  Soviet  Union  in
connection  with  the  development  of  [deletion]  and  safety  devices  for
their  respective  weapons.16
It  is  plausible  that  the  deletion  in  the  above  quotation  refers  to PAL.
Indeed,  interviews with a number  of former  US goverment  officials  indicate
that  the  United  States  provided  information  about  PAL  to  Britain  for  its
land-based  nuclear  weapons.17 However,  the  most  recent  study of  British
command-and-control  policies  concludes  that  PAL are  not  presently  de-
ployed  on  nuclear  weapons  under  exclusive  British  control.
FRANCE
The  current  French  nuclear  arsenal  consists of  80 SLBM,  18 intermediate-
range  ballistic missiles  (IRBM),  44 Pluton  short-range  ballistic  missiles  and
nuclear  capable  Mirage IVA  and  IVP  aircraft.
Under the constitution of the Fifth  Republic, the French President is the
commander  of  the  armed  forces  and  therefore  has  command  authority
over  French  nuclear  forces.  If  the  President  is  killed,  then  the  Prime
Minister  assumes  this  power.  With  the  withdrawal  of  France  from  the
military  structure  of  NATO  in  1966, France  ceased  to be  committed  to  any
formal  treaties  or  external  obligations  limiting  the  authority  of  France  to
use  nuclear  weapons.  Nevertheless,  David  Yost  has  concluded  that
'.  .  . France  and  NATO may  have  exchanged  information  concerning  basic
[nuclear  weapons]  employment  concepts,  perhaps  including  request  and
release  procedures'.19
A  dramatic incident that occurred  in  1960 suggests that French  decision-
makers  may very well perceive  a real  need  for  PAL.  In  May  1958, Charles
de  Gaulle was elected  President  of  France largely on  the  issue of  Algeria.
De  Gaulle  proclaimed  a  policy  of  self-determination  for  Algeria  in
September  1959 and  was bitterly  opposed  by the  hierarchy  of  the  French
military. When the generals attempted to overthrow de Gaulle in 1960, the
French  government  ordered  the  detonation  of  one  of  its  test  nuclear
weapons  in  Algeria  so  that  it  would  not  fall  into  the  hands  of  the
generals.20  This  incident  clearly  underscored  the  need  for  a  capability  to
assure  centralized  civilian  control  over  French  nuclear  weapons.
Currently  available evidence indicates that France uses several  different
techniques to insure positive control over nuclear weapons. First, the two-
man  rule  is  in  effect  for  all  nuclear  forces.  In  a  1984  paper,  General
Francois  Maurin  stated  that  two  French  officers  in  each  IRBM  command
post,  SLBM  command  centre  and  bomber  'must  separately  receive  coded
orders to fire  and  then  act simultaneously  for  the necessary weapons to  be
228

nuclear bombs but are subject to arming procedures incorporating the two-
man rule even in flight. One expert on French nuclear policy, Wilfrid  Kohl,
has  claimed  that  the  Mirage IV  is equipped  with  a  device  that  allows  for
civilian  authorities  to  de-activate  bombs.  Lastly,  French  tactical  nuclear
warheads  are  stored  separately  from  their  launchers,  under  stringent
security  procedures  and  are  equipped  with  a type  of  PAL.23  In  November
1980, then  President  Valery  Giscard  d'Estaing  directly  hinted  that  French
nuclear  weapons  were  equipped  with  PAL:
These  [nuclear  weapons]  decisions  are  naturally  prepared  with  all  the
chain  of  command  and  responsibility,  notably  the  Chief  of  Staff  of  the
Armed  Forces,  who  plays  an  essential  role  in  managing  these  means.
But  the  decision  and  the  execution  depends  upon  the  President  of  the
Republic  alone  .  .  .  who  gives  a  formula  transmitted  by  relays  to  the
means  of  execution  .  .  ,24
THE  SOVIET  UNION
The effort  by the Soviet  Union  to develop nuclear weapons began  in 1943
and  was  managed  and  controlled  by  the  Committee  on  State  Security
(KGB).25  The  USSR  exploded  its  first  nuclear  weapon  in  1949  and
throughout  the  development  and  initial  deployment  periods,  the KGB
remained  in control  of Soviet  nuclear weapons. Not until  Stalin's death in
1953 was  exclusive  KGB  control  ended.  Throughout  the  1950s and  1960s,
nuclear  warheads  and  bombs  were  kept  in  separate  storage  depots  from
their  delivery  systems,  and  the  nuclear  weapons  depots  were  guarded  by
the  KGB.26  Interestingly,  both  the  Soviet  military  and  the  KGB  maintain
separate  command-and-control  communication 
links  between  Soviet
nuclear forces and the political leadership in Moscow.27 This dual  military-
KGB control  arrangement  is extended  into Soviet  inter-continental  ballistic
missile  (ICBM)  launch  control  centres.  According  to  reports,  each  launch
centre  has  a  crew  of  four:  two  officers  from  the  Strategic  Rocket  Forces
and  two  officers  from  the  KGB.28
The  Soviet  Union's  attempt  to  install  intermediate-and  medium-range
ballistic missiles in Cuba in October  1962 resulted in the most serious post-
World  War  II  crisis in  Soviet-American  relations.  Curiously,  despite  the
seriousness of  the  crisis, the  Soviet  Union  failed  to order  a full  alert  of  its
missile forces.29 The  Kennedy  Administration  felt  that  one  reason  for  the
Soviet  Union's  failure  to  order  a  full  alert  was  due  to  Soviet  decision-
makers'  lack  of  confidence  in  their  command-and-control  procedures.
Consequently,  President  Kennedy  and  Secretary  of  Defense  McNamara
decided  to make  the  Soviet  leadership  aware  of  the  US  permissive-action
link  system,  and  on  19 December  1962,  at  an  international  arms-control
symposium  at  the  University  of  Michigan,  one  of  McNamara's  assistants,
John  McNaughton,  delivered  a  speech  in  which  he  described,  in  general
terms,  the  American  PAL system.30  According  to  reports,  US  scientists,
with the blessings of the Kennedy Administration, explained the  American
229
Downloaded by [Simon Fraser University] at 00:18 16 March 2015 PAL  to  Soviet  scientists  who  attended  the  1963  Pugwash  meeting  in
Dubrovnik,  Yugoslavia.31  Apparently,  members  of  the  Kennedy  Admin-
istration  believed  that  assured  centralized  control  over  Soviet  nuclear
weapons  by  the  civilian  authorities  of  the  Soviet  government  was  in  the
interest  of  both  the  Soviet  Union  and  the  United  States.
On  several  later  occasions,  the  United  States  considered  providing  the
Soviet  Union  with  information  about  PAL.  AS noted  earlier  in  this article,
the  Committee  on  Nuclear  Proliferation  chaired  by  Roswell  Gilpatric
concluded  in  1965  that  the  United  States  'should  consider  appropriate
assistance  to  the  United  Kingdom,  France,  and  the  Soviet  Union  in
connection  with  the  development  of  [deleted]  and  safety  devices for  their
respective  weapons'.32  In  an  interview,  a  member  of  this  committee
recalled that consideration was given by the committee to providing PAL to
other  nuclear  weapons  states,  so  it  is  plausible  that  the  deletion  above
referred  to  PAL.33  The  United  States  was  also  prepared  to  provide  the
USSR  with  information  about  PAL in  the  negotiations  that  led  to  the
'Accidents  Measures'  Agreement  of  1971,  according  to  one  of  the  US
negotiators, Sidney Graybeal.34 The Soviet representatives did not  express
interest, so the US did not provide the Soviet Union with this  information.
information
concerning  PAL  or  not,  it  appears  that  the  Soviet  Union  developed  and
installed  PAL on its theatre nuclear weapons and analogous mechanical  and
electronic  locks  on  strategic  nuclear  weapons  to  prevent  unauthorized
use.35 In January  1984, Marshal V. F. Tolubko, the commander-in-chief  of
the  Strategic  Rocket  Forces,  wrote:
influenced  by  the  United  States'  offers  of 
Whether 
Modern  missile  weapons  are  highly  automated  systems,  with  modern
electronic-computing  technology,  for  remote  control  and  monitoring.
Built-in diagnostic systems permit continuous monitoring of all essential
parameters, provide for the most reliable functioning of equipment,  safe
utilization,  and  fully  exclude  unsanctioned  operation.36
More recently, in an article from Izvestiya of March  1986 which purports
to  be  a description  of  a visit  to  an  ICBM silo, the  author  notes:
Today  the  troops  are  armed  with  launch  installations  that  have  wholly
automatic  remote  control  and  an  extremely  short  launch  preparation
time.  The  high  proportion  of  automation  and  electronic  and  computer
equipment  in  the  complex  increases  the  reliability  of  the  weapons  and
combat  equipment  and  the  security  of  their  utilization,  and  entirely
rules  out  any  unsanctioned  operations.37
THE  PEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC OF CHINA
According to the International  Institute  for  Strategic Studies, the  People's
Republic of China currently possesses six ICBM, 60 IRBM, 50 medium-range
ballistic missiles  (MRBM),  120 medium-range  bombers  (some of which may
be  nuclear  capable)  and  two  submarines  with  12  SLBM  under  develop-
ment.38 These weapons are widely dispersed  to insure that they will not  be
230
Downloaded by [Simon Fraser University] at 00:18 16 March 2015 destroyed in a concerted  attack.  Reportedly,  some of the Chinese  missiles
are  deployed  in  caves  in  the  mountains.  This  deployment  pattern  poses
significant  command-and-control  problems,  and  it  is  possible  that  the
Chinese  leadership  has  (or  might)  delegate  nuclear  release  authority  to
regional  military  leaders out  of  fear  that  the  central  leadership  in  Beijing
could  be  killed.
The  military  forces  of the People's  Republic of  China  are controlled  by
the  Communist  Party  of  China,  and  the  state  constitution  designates  the
chairman  of  the  Central  Committee  as  the  commander-in-chief  of  the
armed forces. At the present time, however, it is likely that Deng Xiaoping
(who  holds  the  formal  position  of  Chairman  of  the  Military  Affairs
Commission  and who, according to all accounts, is the pre-eminent  leader
in China today) would, along with other members of the Politburo, decide
whether  or  not  to  use  nuclear  weapons.  According  to  some  sources,  the
Military  Commission  also  plays  a  role  in  Chinese  nuclear  release
procedures.39
Given  the  turbulent  history  of  the  PRC during  the  past  two  decades,
Chinese leaders have good reason to be concerned  about nuclear weapons
control.  One incident  in particular illustrates the magnitude of the  nuclear
weapons control problem facing the Chinese leadership. In 1971, Lin Biao,
who was then  Defence  Minister,  attempted  to  overthrow  Mao  Zedong.40
Following  the  unsuccessful  coup  d'etat,  Lin's  plane  was  shot  down  as  it
headed  for  the  Soviet  Union.  This incident  must  have  raised  the  question
of  civilian  control  over  the  military  in  the  minds of  Chinese  leaders.
China  has  sought  to  assure  control  over  nuclear  weapons  via  physical
control. For example, it appears that China has established an organization
independent  of  its  strategic  forces,  an  organizational  move  designed  to
facilitate  the  leadership's  undisputed  control  over  nuclear  weapons.41
It does not appear from  the available (albeit somewhat scanty) evidence
that  China  has  developed  and  installed  PAL on  its  nuclear  weapons.  In
conversations  with  a  number  of  Chinese,  they  seem  to  have  little
understanding of PAL; in fact,  PAL are frequently  mistakenly confused  with
the  two-key  system,  which  these  Chinese  seem  to  understand  well.
Presumably the Soviet leadership is aware of the fact  that Chinese  nuclear
weapons are not currently equipped with  PAL, given its intelligence sources
and the close co-operation between Soviet and Chinese nuclear scientists in
the  1950s.
The  absence  of  PAL on  Chinese  nuclear  weapons  could  have  dire
consequences. For example, assume that a Sino-Soviet crisis similar to that
which occurred  in March  1969 in the  Ussuri/Amur  River  area  developed.
China  has  far  more  nuclear  weapons  today  that  it  did  in  1969 and,  as  a
result,  Soviet  leaders  must  consider  China  to  be  a  greater  threat.  Soviet
leaders  have  traditionally  feared  the  threat  from  China,  and  these  long-
standing anxieties would be further  increased  if they thought  that  Chinese
nuclear  weapons  were  not  under  the  firm  control  of  the  Chinese  central
leadership.  Taken  to the extreme, Soviet  concern  over the lack of  control
over  nuclear  weapons  could  lead  the  Soviet  Union  to  attack  China  pre-
231
Downloaded by [Simon Fraser University] at 00:18 16 March 2015 emptively.  However,  if  China  had  PAL  installed  on  its  nuclear  weapons,
Soviet fears of a Chinese attack as a result of accident or the  unauthorized
actions of  a local or regional  military  commander  would  be  lessened,  and
crisis  stability  would  be  increased.
The potential proliferators: Israel, India and Pakistan
Available evidence suggests that many of the nuclear weapons deployed by
the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France have PAL installed
on  them;  Chinese  weapons  do  not.  Another  group  of  countries  are
suspected  of  having,  or  being  capable  of  producing,  nuclear  weapons
within a short time. Assessing the nuclear control technologies and policies
of  all  of  the  potential  proliferators  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  article;
