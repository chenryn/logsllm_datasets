User: I have used both Python and C for a while. C is good in a way that i can use Windows cmd or anything like that to compile files and easily read command line arguments. However, the only thing that runs python that I know is IDLE which is like an interpreter and doesnt take command-line arguments and it's hard to work with. Is there anything like the C's cmd and a compiler for python 3.x?
Thanks
Assistant: You can use the python interpreter as a compiler too to compile your python programs.
Say you have a test.py file which you want to compile; then you can use python test.py to compile the file.
To be true, you are not actually compiling the file, you are executing it line by line (well, call it interpreting)
For command line arguments you can use sys.argv as already mentioned in the above answers.
