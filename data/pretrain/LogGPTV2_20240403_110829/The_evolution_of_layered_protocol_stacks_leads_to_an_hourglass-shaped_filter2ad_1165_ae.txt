rience with TCP/IP, they should try to design the functionality of
each layer so that the waist is wider, consisting of several proto-
cols that offer largely distinct but general services, as discussed in
Section 5.5.
7. QUALITY DIFFERENTIATION
So far we have assumed that the value of a protocol is only de-
termined by the value of its products. It would be more realistic
however to consider that the evolutionary value of a protocol also
depends on other factors, which we refer to as quality. The “quality
factor” should be interpreted broadly; it can capture properties such
as performance, extent of deployment, reliability or security, clarity
of the corresponding speciﬁcation or other features. The quality
factor also allows EvoArch to capture the effect of incremental im-
provements in existing protocols: such improvements do not create
a new node in the model, but they increase the quality parameter
of an existing node. In the following, we assume that the quality
factor of a node is constant—an interesting extension of the model
will be to consider time-varying quality factors.
In this section, we conduct a simple extension to the EvoArch
model so that each protocol u has a certain quality factor q(u).
We are mostly interested in two questions. First, how does this
quality differentiation affect the shape of the resulting architecture?
And second, focusing on the kernel nodes at the waist, do they tend

7.3 Implications for IPv4 and IPv6
In the Internet architecture, it would be hard to argue that IPv4
has dominated at the network layer because it was an excellent pro-
tocol in terms of design. During the last 30–40 years, several other
network-layer protocols have been proposed, and probably some
of them were better than IPv4 in several aspects. EvoArch gives us
another way to understand the success of IPv4, and to also think
about future protocols that could potentially replace it. It will help
if such future protocols are better than IPv4; that is not a sufﬁcient
condition to replace IPv4 however. If the potential replacements
attempt to directly compete with IPv4, having a large overlap with
it in terms of applications and services but without offering a major
advantage in terms of the previous “quality factor”, it will remain
difﬁcult to replace IPv4.
What does EvoArch suggest about IPv6 and the difﬁculty that the
latter faces in replacing the aging IPv4? We should ﬁrst note that
IPv6 does not offer new services compared to IPv4; it mostly offers
many more addresses.7 This means that IPv6 has, at most, the same
products with IPv4, and so the latter is its competitor. Further,
because IPv6 is not widely deployed, it is reasonable to assume
that its quality factor is much lower than that of IPv4. So, even
if the two protocols had the same set of products, IPv4 has much
higher value and it wins the competition with IPv6. The situation
would be better for IPv6 under two conditions. First, if IPv6 could
offer some popular new services that IPv4 cannot offer—that would
provide the former with additional products (and value) that the
latter does not have. Second, IPv6 should avoid competition with
IPv4, at least until it has been widely deployed. That would be the
case if IPv6 was presented, not as a replacement to IPv4, but as
“the second network layer protocol” that is required to support the
previous new services.
8. RELATED WORK
To the extent of our knowledge, there is no prior work in mod-
eling the evolution of protocol stacks or hourglass-like network ar-
chitectures. At a high level however, our work is related to recent
efforts that develop a rigorous theory of network layering and ar-
chitecture, mostly using mathematical tools from optimization and
control systems [4]. We agree with those authors that network ar-
chitecture can become the subject of more quantitative and rigor-
ous scientiﬁc methods. We have a different view however on how
to get there: instead of thinking about each layer as the solution to
an optimization problem, we focus on the evolutionary process that
shapes a network architecture over time and we emphasize the role
of robustness and evolvability instead of optimality. Also relevant
is the work of Csete and Doyle [5], which has emphasized the role
of hierarchical modularity and evolution in both technological and
biological systems. Those authors have also identiﬁed the signif-

such as mobility, improved auto-conﬁguration and IP-layer secu-
rity, but eventually IPv6 became mostly an IPv4-like protocol with
many more addresses.
icance of the hourglass (or bowtie) structure in the corresponding
network architectures.
Recent work has investigated the competition between incum-
bent and emerging network architectures [13, 14]. Their focus,
however, is mostly on the deployment share of each architecture
using economic models from the literature of technology diffusion.
We think that the deployment effects represent just one of many in-
stances of competition between protocols at the same layer. In the
economics literature, several authors have focused on standards,
compatibility, and on the diffusion of new technologies (see, for
instance, the early work by Farrell and Saloner [11] or the review
[7]). That line of work focuses on the positive externalities created
by the requirement for compatibility, and how those externalities
often lead to the dominance of a single standard or protocol. To the
extent of our knowledge, however, there is no work in economics
about multi-layer architectures or networks that involve multiple
standards, and no studies of the hourglass or bowtie structure that
can emerge in such architectures.
In a 2001 IETF talk, Steve Deering alarmed the community that
the waist of the Internet architecture is getting bigger, as more func-
tionality (such as QoS or native multicast) was then proposed for
IPv4 [8]—EvoArch suggests that a wider waist, with different pro-
tocols offering largely non-overlapping but general services, is ac-
tually a good way to increase the evolvability of an architecture.
Popa et al. argue that HTTP (a layer-5 protocol) can become the
new narrow waist of the Internet architecture because almost all
applications and services today can run over HTTP [18]. We ar-
gue that instead of pushing a single-protocol waist from layer-3 to
layer-5, a more evolvable network architecture should have a wider
waist that does not include only one protocol. Otherwise, HTTP
will also be considered “ossiﬁed” and an obstacle to innovation
in few years from now. Culler et al. argue that the narrow waist
of a sensor network architecture should not be the network layer,
as in the current Internet, but a single-hop broadcast with a rich
enough interface to allow multiple network protocols [6]. EvoArch
can help designers of such new and special-purpose architectures
to think about the ideal location of the hourglass waist considering
the generality of the services provided at each layer.
9. CRITICISM
EvoArch does not consider the semantics and various practical
aspects of speciﬁc layers, protocols or architectures. There are cer-
tainly several objections to this abstract modeling approach. We
include here some of the concerns expressed by the anonymous re-
viewers, including a brief response.
One reviewer summarized most of the criticism with the follow-
ing quote: “The strength of this work is the simplicity of the model
as it makes fairly general assumptions that are not tied into, for
instance, the semantics of what each layer does. However, the fail-
ure to take semantics into account is its biggest failing as well.”
EvoArch shows that it is not necessary to consider the layer seman-
tics for the emergence of the hourglass structure; the semantics are
probably important for other architectural characteristics but not for
the hourglass structure.
Another high-level concern relates to the conﬁrmation-bias risk:
“The problem with a paper like this is that we know the answer the
model must produce, so (like Jeopardy) we have to ﬁnd a model
that can be tweaked to give that answer, and then see if we learn
anything beyond what we already knew about the answer.” It is true
that our objective has been to identify a model that can produce the
hourglass structure. Additionally, however, our objective was to
identify a general, parsimonious and explanatory model based on
a small set of principles about layered and evolving network archi-
216tectures. More importantly, EvoArch leads to several insights and
explanations that were not expected from or “built-in” the model
formulation.
Some reviewers offer different explanations for the narrow pro-
tocol waist at the network layer: “The need for global addressing is
a more important factor in having a single internetworking proto-
col than the evolutionary dynamics proposed here. IP does almost
nothing else besides global addressing, and there is little reason to
have two global addressing protocols.” This view is also reﬂected
in the following quote: “What if the reality is that the lower-most
layer that provides end-to-end connectivity is the waist by default
because that in effect represents the balance between generality
and ease of use? It is hard to roll out an end-to-end connectivity
service on top of lower-level primitives, and IP won because it got
there (wide-area deployment) ﬁrst.” Note that the previous plausi-
ble explanations for the presence of a narrow waist (with a single
protocol at the network layer) do not explain, however, why we
observe an hourglass structure. Another reviewer thinks that the
hourglass structure is a result of a wide diversity of constraints at
the lower layers and a wide diversity of services and applications at
the upper layers: “The more relevant dynamic at the bottom of the
architecture is that there are different environmental niches (wire-
less, optical, etc.)
that serve different needs in terms of deploy-
ability, bandwidth, and cost. So the model should have idiosyn-
cratic applications at the top and idiosyncratic technologies at the
bottom, tied together by layered protocols of varying generalities.”
This is actually similar to EvoArch, even though it introduces more
“semantics” about the function and constraints of lower layer pro-
tocols.
A more negative review questioned even whether the protocol
stack has the shape of an hourglass: “This model bears no intu-
itive relation to reality - in assumptions about the conditions under
which protocols are invented, the process by which some are se-
lected over others, or, indeed, that the protocol stack of the Internet
is an hourglass (in practice, it is not: VPNs, tunnels, federation
with other networks like the phone system, all complicate the pic-
ture).” We believe that despite the former architectural exceptions
(that are hard to place at a given layer), the Internet architecture
is still shaped as an hourglass. Finally, we repeat what should be
well-known to any scientist: the beauty and usefulness of a model
is that it allows us to understand certain aspects of a system without
having to describe or consider all the elements that constitute that
system.
10. CONCLUSIONS
A main thesis behind this work is that we can study network ar-
chitectures in a quantitative and scientiﬁc manner, in the same way
that we study for instance the performance of transport protocols
or the stability of routing protocols.
In this spirit, we proposed
a model for the evolution of layered protocol stacks. EvoArch is
based on few principles about the generality of protocols at differ-
ent layers, the competition between protocols at the same layer, and
how new protocols are created. Even though EvoArch does not cap-
ture many practical aspects and protocol-speciﬁc or layer-speciﬁc
details, it predicts the emergence of an hourglass architecture and
the appearance of few stable nodes (not always of the highest qual-
ity) at the waist. Further, EvoArch offers some intriguing insights
about the evolution of the TCP/IP stack, the competition between
IPv4 and IPv6, and the evolvability of future Internet architectures.
Possible extensions of EvoArch include a dynamic notion of qual-
ity (to capture, for instance, how the deployment of a protocol can
change with time depending on the protocol’s value), a growing
number of layers as the complexity of the provided services in-
creases with time, and architectures without strict layering.
Finally, we note that the presence of hourglass (or bowtie-like)
architectures has been also observed in metabolic and gene regu-
latory networks [5, 20], in the organization of the innate immune
system [2], as well as in gene expression during development [15].
Even though it sounds far-fetched, it is possible that there are sim-
ilarities between the evolution of protocol stacks and the evolu-
tion of the previous biological systems. We explore these cross-
disciplinary connections in on-going work.
