User: bulkloader.py is very handy. 
But as far as I can tell it doesn't appear to fetch items from the blobstore, so you can be left with broken entity relationships if you needed to dump/restore your application.
Does anyone know a method for completely backing up their data from app-engine including blobstore data?
Assistant: In Java, you would instantiate a BlobInfoFactory and use BlobInfoFactory.queryBlobInfos. 
Then for each blob, you would run BlobstoreService.serve(...) with the BlobKeys returned from the BlobInfos.  You still might end up with broken entity relationships - there's no way to guarantee each blob will end up with the same key it was originally loaded with.  You'll have to account for this in your application.
