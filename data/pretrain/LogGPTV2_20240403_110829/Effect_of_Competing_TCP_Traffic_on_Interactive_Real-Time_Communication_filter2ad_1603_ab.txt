### Analysis of the Impact of Competing TCP Traffic on Interactive Real-Time Communication

#### Introduction
This document analyzes the impact of competing TCP traffic on the one-way delay and loss rate of an audio flow. The study involves varying the number of short TCP flows and initial window (IW) sizes, and it examines the transient effects of delay jitter on the media flow.

#### Data Overview
The data provided includes multiple sequences of numbers and characters, which appear to be part of a larger dataset or experimental setup. For clarity, we will focus on the key findings and analysis.

#### Key Figures and Tables
- **Figure 4**: Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of one-way delay for an audio flow competing with \( n \) short TCP flows, with 50 replications.
- **Figure 5**: Loss rate with different jitter buffer sizes for Audio + \( n \) short TCP flows.
- **Table 1**: CDF of IPDV (IP Packet Delay Variation) for an audio flow competing with \( n \) short TCP flows, with 50 replications.
- **Table 2**: Definition of loss period levels for estimating loss period effects.

#### One-Way Delay Analysis
The one-way delay for the audio flow remains below 150 ms even when competing with one or two TCP flows. However, as the number of competing TCP flows increases, the delay approaches 200 ms. This is particularly noticeable when the combined initial windows of parallel TCP flows are large.

#### IP Packet Delay Variation (IPDV)
The IPDV values for the media flow are shown in Table 1. High-end IPDV values correlate well with the increase in the size of the combined initial windows of parallel TCP flows. Specifically, large IPDV values occur when the TCP initial windows are injected into the network. With IW10, these large IPDV values are primarily introduced during the injection of the initial windows.

#### Jitter Buffer and Loss Rate
To explore the transient effect of delay jitter on the media flow, a jitter filter was introduced to mimic the behavior of a receiving codec that drops late-arriving packets. The loss rate, which combines pure losses (due to congestion or link errors) and delay-based losses (when packet delay exceeds the jitter buffer limit), is shown in Figure 5. 

- **IW10** significantly increases the loss rate to nearly 100% with lower jitter buffer sizes.
- **IW3** with a large number of parallel connections also produces a significant number of losses, primarily due to excessive delay rather than pure losses.

#### Loss Period Effects
To estimate the loss period effect on the interactive media from the codec and end-user perspective, a metric based on loss periods was defined (Table 2). The loss period level is assigned to each data packet carrying interactive media (Audio) based on the gap in the stream.

- **Best Case (Level 0)**: No loss.
- **Worst Case (Level 5)**: 200+ ms of the stream was lost.

Figures 6a, 6b, and 6c show the loss period effect over time for a media flow using a 40 ms jitter buffer and competing with 1, 2, and 6 short TCP flows, respectively. The loss period level values are filtered to include only the media flow packets that overlap with the TCP transfers.

- **Single TCP Connection**: The worst effect occurs immediately after the SYN handshakes complete and the initial windows are injected.
- **Multiple TCP Connections**: The arrival of the initial windows causes the most significant effect during the transfer.

#### Conclusion
The study highlights the critical impact of competing TCP traffic on the one-way delay and loss rate of an audio flow. Large initial window sizes and a high number of parallel connections can significantly degrade the quality of the media flow. The use of a jitter buffer and the estimation of loss period effects provide valuable insights into the transient effects of delay jitter on real-time communication.
