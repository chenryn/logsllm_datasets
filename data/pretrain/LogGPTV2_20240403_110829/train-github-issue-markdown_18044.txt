AbstractApplicationEventMulticaster has two getApplicationListeners methods.
The no parameter method will return duplicate listeners in its list while the
one subsetting by event type does not.
It appears that when the default ListenerRetriever class is iterating over the
listenerBeanNames the add call should be protected by a
!allListeners.contains(listener) check like the event subset method is.
Attached is a zip file which shows the two listeners printed from the no
parameter method while only one is printed from the event type method.
