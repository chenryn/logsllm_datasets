**Casey Hadden** opened **SPR-7204** and provided the following comments:

In `AbstractApplicationEventMulticaster`, there are two `getApplicationListeners` methods. The method without parameters returns a list that may contain duplicate listeners, while the method that subsets by event type does not include duplicates.

Upon investigation, it appears that when the default `ListenerRetriever` class iterates over `listenerBeanNames`, the `add` call should be protected by a `!allListeners.contains(listener)` check, similar to how the event subset method is implemented.

Attached is a zip file, `AbstractApplicationEventMulticaster.zip` (1.41 kB), which demonstrates the issue. The file shows that the no-parameter method prints two listeners, whereas the event-type method prints only one.
