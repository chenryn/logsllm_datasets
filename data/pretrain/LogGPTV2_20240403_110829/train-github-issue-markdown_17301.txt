I've been porting over some debugging code into Deno 1.0.0 and discovered that
the file path in stack traces can be suppressed under certain scenarios.
I have simplified the test scenario to the following code:
    // Place this code in /tmp/deno_test as path_test.ts
    // % cd /tmp/deno_test
    // % deno run path_test.ts
    // Exception contains full path
    // % cd /tmp
    // % deno run deno_test/path_test.ts
    // Exception does not contain full path!!
    import * as path from "https://deno.land/std/path/mod.ts";
    function f1(){ throw new Error("damn") }
    try {
      f1()
    }catch(e){
      console.log(e)
    }
Here the output from my Ubuntu 20.04 with Deno 1.0.0:
    /tmp/deno_test$ deno run path_test.ts 
    Compile file:///tmp/deno_test/path_test.ts
    Error: damn
        at f1 (file:///tmp/deno_test/path_test.ts:11:22)
        at file:///tmp/deno_test/path_test.ts:14:3
    /tmp/deno_test$ cd ../
    /tmp$ deno run deno_test/path_test.ts 
    Compile file:///tmp/deno_test/path_test.ts
    Error: damn
        at f1 (path_test.ts:11:22)
        at path_test.ts:14:3
When the line `import * as path from "https://deno.land/std/path/mod.ts"` is
commented out the issue goes away on my machine.
