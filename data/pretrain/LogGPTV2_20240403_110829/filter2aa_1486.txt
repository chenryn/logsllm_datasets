SAVING THE INTERNET

Atlantic Council 
1.
Shift in people demographics – different nations, different values and 
relationship of millenials 
2.
Shift in device and computing demographics – massive uptick in devices (IoT 
and IoE), change in how people connect (mobile), change in how and where 
computing is done (cloud, quantum, wearable and embedded) 
3.
Massive growth in data – big data, analytics, universal telemetry from IOT 
4.
Growing tech and policy challenges  –  Moore’s  Law?  Network  neutrality 
5.
Breakdown of governance – walled gardens, increase of national borders, 
decreasing trust, lack of large-scale crisis management mechanisms 
6.
Continuing attacker and offense advantage over defense  –  O>D  
The Large Internet Trends 
Cyberspace… 
Domain of Warfare – or Not? 
A global domain within the information environment consisting of the  
interdependent network of information technology infrastructures and resident data,  
including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors 
and controllers 
Although cyberspace is a man-made domain, it has 
become just as critical to military operations as land, 
sea, air, and space. As such, the military must be able to 
defend and operate within it. 
- Bill Lynn, then-Deputy Secretary of Defense 
By increasingly equating 
“cyber”  with  “national  
security”  the  Washington  
policy community has 
militarized the underlying 
resource, the Internet

How many future Renaissances and

if we – all of us, for any purpose – keep 
treating the Internet as a place for crime, 
warfare and espionage?  
SAVING FOR WHOM? 
Saving  …  for Whom? 
 Sustainable for future generations 
 Not just five years or fifty but two hundred and 
fifty 
 Especially as some of the most innovative 
technologies in our near future must have 
strong security for us to unlock them without 
resulting disaster

Global Shocks 
Initiated or Amplified Through the Internet 
“As  society  becomes  more  
technologic, even the mundane 
comes to depend on distant 
digital  perfection.”       
Dan Geer  
“This  increasingly  tight  coupling  of  the  
internet with the real economy and society 
means a full-scale cyber shock is far more 
likely  to  occur.”   
“Beyond  Data  Breaches:  Global  
Interconnections  of  Cyber  Risk” 
Bad Guys Finish First 
“Few 
if 
any 
contemporary 
computer 
security controls have prevented a [red 
team] 
from 
easily 
accessing 
any 
information sought.”  
Lt Col Roger Schell (USAF) in 1979

Great News!  Security is Getting Better! 
Whether in detection, control, or prevention, we are notching 
personal bests…
