#### Key Trends in the Internet

1. **Demographic Shifts:**
   - Changing national demographics and values, particularly among millennials.
   
2. **Device and Computing Evolution:**
   - A significant increase in the number of devices (IoT and IoE).
   - Changes in how people connect (e.g., mobile devices).
   - Shifts in where and how computing is performed (e.g., cloud, quantum, wearables, and embedded systems).

3. **Data Growth:**
   - Massive growth in data, driven by big data, analytics, and universal telemetry from IoT.

4. **Technological and Policy Challenges:**
   - The implications of Moore's Law and network neutrality.
   
5. **Governance Breakdown:**
   - The rise of walled gardens and national borders.
   - Decreasing trust and a lack of large-scale crisis management mechanisms.

6. **Attacker Advantage:**
   - The continuing advantage of attackers over defenders (O > D).

#### Cyberspace: Domain of Warfare or Not?

**Definition:**
- Cyberspace is a global domain within the information environment, comprising the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures and resident data, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.

**Military Significance:**
- Although cyberspace is a man-made domain, it has become as critical to military operations as land, sea, air, and space. As such, the military must be able to defend and operate within it.
  - *Bill Lynn, then-Deputy Secretary of Defense*

**Militarization of the Internet:**
- By increasingly equating "cyber" with "national security," the Washington policy community has militarized the underlying resource, the Internet.

#### Historical Context and Future Implications

- **Global Internet Users:**
  - 1993: 14 million
  - 2003: 778 million
  - 2013: 2.7 billion
  - 2030? 2280?

- **Cyber Threats:**
  - Data breaches
  - Cyber crime
  - Anonymous
  - Malware
  - Espionage
  - State-sponsored attacks
  - Stuxnet
  - Heartbleed
  - Erection of borders

- **Privacy and Civil Liberties:**
  - Violations of privacy and civil liberties.
  - Legal and constitutional concerns.

- **Future Economic and National Security:**
  - How many future Renaissances and Enlightenments will humanity miss if we continue to treat the Internet as a place for crime, warfare, and espionage?

#### Saving the Internet: For Whom and From What?

- **Sustainability:**
  - Ensuring the Internet is sustainable for future generations, not just for five or fifty years, but for two hundred and fifty years.
  - Strong security is essential for unlocking innovative technologies without resulting in disaster.

- **Security Concerns:**
  - Obvious threats.
  - Global shocks initiated or amplified through the Internet.
  - Tipping points that could lead to more frequent and severe cyber incidents.

#### The Ongoing Battle: Offense vs. Defense

- **Current State:**
  - Attackers often have the upper hand (O > D).
  - Even with improvements in detection, control, and prevention, the opposition continues to set new records.

- **Future Possibilities:**
  - Can this imbalance last forever?
  - When will there be more predators than prey?

#### Solutions

- **Private-Sector Centric Approach:**
  - Disruptive defensive technologies that work at scale.
  - Sustainable cyberspace.
  - Working at scale.

- **Single Cyber Strategy:**
  - Implementing a comprehensive strategy to ensure D > O and eventually D >> O.

- **Call to Action:**
  - What will you do?
  - Are you sure youâ€™re really helping?
