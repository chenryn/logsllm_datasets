relocation, redirection and evolution of services. As 
we have seen, the involvement of a wide variety of 
people in these activities has implications beyond 
productivity, efficiency, or experience. We would 
also need to think in terms of new co-governance 
possibilities that are open or closed by design. These 
types of processes drift away from the project type 
of engagement that is typical of design consultancy 
model of working (Kimbel 2012) and instead bring 
forward some aspects that resemble activism 
practices (Julier 2011) and even participation in social 
movement creation (Seppälä 2012).
One of the examples analyzed in the SIG is the 
case of Cleaning day (Siivouspäivä), a carnival-like 
event designed to be performed twice a year. It is a 
day where anyone is encouraged to sell, swap and 
donate stuff that people have at home and don’t 
use anymore. The idea started out as informal 
conversation with friends on the possibilities to do 
something about reducing the amount of stuff in 
their homes and at the same time thinking in terms 
of recycling and up-cycling, new urban culture and 
community building. After some initial enthusiasm 
around a Facebook status update, a working group 
of active people got together to create a platform 
(tools, information, resources, communication 
channels) that citizens could use to turn Helsinki 
into a giant flea market during one day (Seppälä 
2012). The initiative is now in its third version and 
has spread to other cities as well. This is an example 
of a self-organizing group, who has applied social 
media and savvy use of distributed design skills to 
build momentum for the event and the mobilization 
of people. Among other things it has induced change 
in the way city authorities deal with the provision of 
permits for selling second-hand stuff in public space. 
After the first Cleaning day took place, the office in 
charge at the public works department of the City 
of Helsinki approached the core-organizing group 
to discuss possibilities for cooperation. One of the 
outcomes was the use of the Cleaning day online 
platform as a way for officializing one’s flea-market 
activities during the day, without having to ask for a 
permit per se. This arrangement between the Cleaning 
day group and the city officials is an example of how 
design-in-use takes place without prior planning, but 
through collaboration “through doing” and hints at 
7
the possibilities of looking at the possibilities of new 
service constellations to emerge with multiple shapes 
of partnerships.
In these circumstances design engagement seems 
to be shifting towards achieving resilience of the 
co-designed services by actively dealing with design-
in-use. By this we mean a process to deal not only 
with designers and their design process, but rather 
embracing how the things undergoing design, and the 
design process itself, are simultaneously embedded in 
existing everyday life arrangements; some which can 
be part of an activist agenda but not necessarily.
The concept of design-in-use thus expands to include 
practices related to handling the multitude of tools 
at hand: configurations, customizations, adaptations, 
maintenance, reuse, even sometimes redesign through

“artful integrations” (Suchman, 1994) and bricolage-
type of activities (Büscher et al., 2001, Karasti & 
Syrjänen, 2004, Botero et al., 2010, Botero, 2013). 
Some of these aspects have been dealt recently under 
the rubric of infrastructuring and prototyping (see 
Hillgren et al.2011, Hillgren 2013 this compilation) 
and while some progress has been made in that 
direction there is a lot more of work that needs to be 
done. Especially when the time and the “rhythms” of 
public and collaborative ventures are different than 
traditional design projects, it is clear that design 
practice needs new models to address long-term 
commitments.
4.  TIME, NEW ENGAGEMENTS AND PARTNERSHIPS?
Design interventions are traditionally often limited 
to the production of a particular outcome, or the 
application of “designerly” techniques to service 
innovation problems. Interventions are set to take 
place during a certain period of time. However, as we 
have seen, the emergence of co-production and peer 
production of services will require a framework of co-
governance and design-in-use. This, we argue, requires 
novel understandings of the timeframe of design and 
collaboration in design activities.  Service design that 
aims to be public and collaborative needs to seriously 
address in more nuanced ways issues related to time.
Many of the cases presented in the book and analysed 
in the SIG are not cases of participation activities 
staged by designers, planners, or other facilitators. 
They are cases of active citizens having already 
recognized a need for action (e.g. Time banking, 
cleaning day, community spaces) and having scanned 
possible partners and tools that would help them in 
their endeavors. If we are to position our own work, 
as designers, in the context of co-governance, through 
a design-in-use approach, there are a variety of 
challenges to tackle.
One of the challenges is ensuring the sustainability 
of the co-produced services, after the design 
research projects ends. The dynamics of working 
with communities are looser, especially in terms of 
timeframes. The involvement of designers in such 
endeavors can be sustained in time if the design-in-
use and adaptation strategies are decided early on. 
Moreover, it is important that the designed outcomes 
e.g. a service, needs not to be the end-point of the 
design activities, but it can become a trigger for 
other kind of changes that may happen in time, in the 
context of use (Saad-Sulonen et al., 2012).
What are then the responsibilities of the designers, 
this time through an expanded timeframe that goes 
beyond the traditional staged collaborative design 
activities? Until what point should the designers 
be tied to the process of evolution of a service?  
In our own work we notice that sometimes it is 
unavoidable to eventually get bored and tired 
of this link that ties us to an engagement. We 
sometime have felt like cutting the umbilical 
cord, and at the same time we want to keep our 
accountability towards the settings and the people 
we learn to appreciate and know. When should the 
separation happen, or if further commitment is created 
is e.g. social entrepreneurship a more viable route? 
Moreover, is the co-design setting the only cause 
that keeps the link alive between people and the 
designers? Can there be other types of engagements 
and partnerships? 
We welcome feedback, ideas and fruitful conversation 
with the DESIS community to develop this issues 
further.

IMPLICATIONS FOR: 
DESIGN PRACTICE
•	
•	
•	
•	
Design practice needs to device new ways of engagement beyond 
traditional R&D project forms and consultancy models.
Design practice needs to understand that public and collaborative 
endeavors have different time frames.
Design practice should recognize possibilities fro participation and 
collaboration beyond activities staged by designers and/or other experts 
in design-in-use.
Designs (per se) should accommodate possibilities for peer production and 
co-production. Contributions towards building commons are needed now 
more than ever.
DESIGN EDUCATION
•	
Design study projects for public sector cannot be silos of one discipline, 
more cross-fertilization is needed.
•	 We need to educate designers that are more versed in communication 
with policy experts. They need vocabulary and basic understanding of 
governance related issues.
•	 We need to equip social workers, political scientist and sociologist –
amongst others- with basic design vocabulary. 
POLICYMAKING
•	
There is a need for policies that provide spaces for experimentation and 
possibilities for risk taking in the public sector. 
•	 Models are needed to facilitate collaboration with community led 
initiatives (to scale them up? To make them sustainable?) and for the 
creation of commons. This can be anything from providing supporting 
infrastructure, give recognition, or even creating shared language.

ABOUT THE AUTHORS
Andrea Botero is a doctoral candidate at the School of Arts, Design and Architecture of the Aalto University were 
she also works as project lead and designer in externally funded R&D projects. Her research interest spin around 
understanding theoretical and practical implications of broad participation in creative design processes and how this 
relates to "innovation". Her design work explores services, media formats, genres and technologies for communities 
and their social practices.
Joanna Saad-Sulonen is a doctoral candidate at the School of Arts, Design and Architecture of the Aalto University. 
She has a background in architecture and new media and digital design. Her research addresses the limitations 
of the current approach to participatory e-planning, where the relationship between technology and citizen 
participation in urban planning is often based on the application of "ready-to-use" technology in the context of 
formal participation and urban planning processes. By situating her work at the intersection of digital design and 
urban planning, she proposes a new conceptualization of participatory e-planning, which enables the collaborative 
development of both technologies and participation processes concurrently.

SERVICE DESIGN FOR INTERCULTURAL DIALOG.
MAKING A STEP TOWARDS A MULTICULTURAL 
SOCIETY.
Margherita Pillan, Irina Suteu
ABSTRACT
The Italian society has traditionally been identified as a mono-cultural one, being characterized by 
homogeneous values (concerning, for instance: family, religion,…) and strong attachment to local customs; 
the country we live in is usually praised for its cultural heritage, and famous for its rigid, complex and 
cumbersome bureaucratic system. Recently Italy is passing through demographic and social changes bringing 
a mixture of cultures that converge into the Italian environments. In particular in Lombardy the presence of 
foreign population increased in the last decade by 11 % by year with peeks between 19-23% in the period 
from 2003 to 2005,1[1] changing the picture of the Italian demographics and creating a constant pressure at 
the administrative level. The phenomenon of immigration in Italy has grown significantly over the last three 
decades. However, many public services have a complex, outdated organization system and the presence of 
many citizens of foreign origin exerts pressure on institutions, urging them to change. Up to now, political 
parties have not been able to propose innovative solutions in the law system and in the public service

institutions so to correspond to the social changes. A number of nongovernmental organizations offer services 
in different fields, such as education, health care, basic help for the poorest. 
The research and education activities reported in this paper were guided by some questions: how to promote 
social cohesion in multicultural urban environments? What role can service design play with respect to a 
full acceptance of social change due to multicultural complexity? How can we contribute to public service 
innovation so to correspond to multicultural issues?
Acknowledging this, the next paper presents a pedagogical experiment aiming to address the social issues 
coming from the above-mentioned situation and that starts an inquiry on the possible role of the design 
in proposing intercultural dialog scenarios. The course is part of the wider research on social sustainability 
expressed in the public and collaborative cluster of the DESIS Network.
1. SOCIAL CHANGE FOR A MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY
1.2 Italy from a homogeneous to a diverse social context
Over the past decades, Italy has seen the arrival of 
a growing number of foreigners who moved to our 
country in search of job opportunities, to study, for 
personal or political reasons, and more.
In this paper, we will indicate these people with the 
terms: new Italians or new citizens [2], to emphasize 
their belonging to the social structure of Italy, and their 
different ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Despite the 
complexity of the different phenomena that can be 
related to the progressive transformation of Italian 
society toward a multicultural asset, it is possible to 
single out some issues that should be afforded in order 
to improve life quality and social wellbeing.
During our research, we have addressed many 
different aspects of living conditions of the new 
citizens and tried to understand what the priority ‘to 
be addressed and the issues on which the design of 
the services may bring contributions more’ important.
The Italian law system is mainly based on the jus 
sanguinis principle, that is, the citizenship rights 
are normally granted only to those who were born 
from Italian citizens; for this reason, the children of 
immigrants do not automatically get citizenship even 
if they were born on Italian soil.  Most Italians tend to 
take the jus sanguinis principles underlying as natural 
since the long lasting tradition; a change of this 
deeply rooted principle will require time and work. 
Due to the relative novelty of the immigration 
phenomena, most people tend to consider as ‘new 
comers’ and ‘last arrived’ all the citizens with a foreign 
origins, even when they were born in Italy; public 
institution managers slowly start to consider the 
different needs emerging from the multicultural social 
14
composition and in most cases the search for practical 
solutions to problems is empirically carried on, without 
a real political debate about the ongoing change and 
suitable strategies.
Despite the relevancy of the new citizens in the Italian 
work system, many immigrants get jobs that under-use
