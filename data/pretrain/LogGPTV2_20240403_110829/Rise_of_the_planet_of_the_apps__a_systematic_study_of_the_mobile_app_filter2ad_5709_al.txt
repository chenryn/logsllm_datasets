either only free or only paid apps).
Overall, we believe that our study can be useful for both appstore opera-
tors and developers: (i) The existence of locality in user downloads, as this is
manifested by the Pareto e(cid:11)ect, can help appstores design e(cid:14)cient caching
mechanisms that will improve the speed of delivering apps to end users.
(ii) The understanding of download patterns, like clustering e(cid:11)ect, can help
appstores to design better recommendation systems, which can bene(cid:12)t apps
and developers by giving them better opportunities for more suggestions
and downloads. Moreover, users that prefer a variety of choices will have a
better experience with recommendation systems that do not bombard them
with the same set of most popular choices. (iii) Understanding the parame-
ters that a(cid:11)ects app popularity are of high interest for developers that want
to predict, understand, and most importantly, improve the popularity of
their apps. (iv) Understanding the temporal a(cid:14)nity of users to app cate-
gories can help the design of more e(cid:14)cient prefetching and advertisement
methods. (v) Our model for app downloads will be helpful for appstores to
estimate app popularity and future downloads of each app. Estimating the
downloads per app will enable appstores to pinpoint problematic apps and
either favor them through better recommendations or remove them from the
market. (vi) Understanding which pricing models result in larger revenue
can help developers to choose an appropriate pricing policy for their apps
to increase app popularity and their income.
