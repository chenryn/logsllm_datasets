Abstract—We evaluate two decades of proposals to replace
text passwords for general-purpose user authentication on the
web using a broad set of twenty-ﬁve usability, deployability
and security beneﬁts that an ideal scheme might provide.
The scope of proposals we survey is also extensive, including
password management software, federated login protocols,
graphical password schemes, cognitive authentication schemes,
one-time passwords, hardware tokens, phone-aided schemes
and biometrics. Our comprehensive approach leads to key
insights about the difﬁculty of replacing passwords. Not only
does no known scheme come close to providing all desired
beneﬁts: none even retains the full set of beneﬁts that legacy
passwords already provide. In particular, there is a wide range
from schemes offering minor security beneﬁts beyond legacy
passwords, to those offering signiﬁcant security beneﬁts in
return for being more costly to deploy or more difﬁcult to use.
We conclude that many academic proposals have failed to gain
traction because researchers rarely consider a sufﬁciently wide
range of real-world constraints. Beyond our analysis of current
schemes, our framework provides an evaluation methodology
and benchmark for future web authentication proposals.

I. INTRODUCTION
The continued domination of passwords over all other
methods of end-user authentication is a major embarrass-
ment
to security researchers. As web technology moves
ahead by leaps and bounds in other areas, passwords stub-
bornly survive and reproduce with every new web site.
Extensive discussions of alternative authentication schemes
have produced no deﬁnitive answers.
Over forty years of research have demonstrated that
passwords are plagued by security problems [2] and openly
hated by users [3]. We believe that, to make progress, the
community must better systematize the knowledge that we
have regarding both passwords and their alternatives [4].
However, among other challenges, unbiased evaluation of
password replacement schemes is complicated by the diverse

interests of various communities. In our experience, security
experts focus more on security but less on usability and
practical issues related to deployment; biometrics experts
focus on analysis of false negatives and naturally-occurring
false positives rather than on attacks by an intelligent,
adaptive adversary; usability experts tend to be optimistic
about security; and originators of a scheme, whatever their
background, downplay or ignore beneﬁts that their scheme
doesn’t attempt to provide, thus overlooking dimensions on
which it fares poorly. As proponents assert the superiority
of their schemes, their objective functions are often not ex-
plicitly stated and differ substantially from those of potential
adopters. Targeting different authentication problems using
different criteria, some address very speciﬁc environments
and narrow scenarios; others silently seek generic solutions
that ﬁt all environments at once, assuming a single choice
is mandatory. As such, consensus is unlikely.
These and other factors have contributed to a long-
standing lack of progress on how best
to evaluate and
compare authentication proposals intended for practical use.
In response, we propose a standard benchmark and frame-
work allowing schemes to be rated across a common, broad
spectrum of criteria chosen objectively for relevance in wide-
ranging scenarios, without hidden agenda.1 We suggest and
deﬁne 25 properties framed as a diverse set of beneﬁts,
and a methodology for comparative evaluation, demonstrated
and tested by rating 35 password-replacement schemes on
the same criteria, as summarized in a carefully constructed
comparative table.
Both the rating criteria and their deﬁnitions were it-
eratively reﬁned over the evaluation of these schemes.
Discussion of evaluation details for passwords and nine
representative alternatives is provided herein to demonstrate
the process, and to provide evidence that the list of beneﬁts
sufﬁces to illuminate the strengths and weaknesses of a wide
universe of schemes. Though not cast in stone, we believe
that the list of beneﬁts and their speciﬁc deﬁnitions provide
an excellent basis from which to work; the framework and

readers to verify that we have rated them impartially.
evaluation process that we deﬁne are independent of them,
although our comparative results naturally are not. From our
analysis and comparative summary table, we look for clues
to help explain why passwords remain so dominant, despite
frequent claims of superior alternatives.
In the past decade our community has recognized a
tension between security and usability: it is generally easy
to provide more of one by offering less of the other. But
the situation is much more complex than simply a linear
trade-off: we seek to capture the multi-faceted, rather than
one-dimensional, nature of both usability and security in our
beneﬁts. We further suggest that “deployability”, for lack of
a better word, is an important third dimension that deserves
consideration. We choose to examine all three explicitly,
complementing earlier comparative surveys (e.g., [9]–[11]).
Our usability-deployability-security (“UDS”) evaluation
framework and process may be referred to as semi-structured
evaluation of user authentication schemes. We take inspira-
tion from inspection methods for evaluating user interface
design, including feature inspections and Nielsen’s heuristic
analysis based on usability principles [12].
Each co-author acted as a domain expert, familiar with
both the rating framework and a subset of the schemes.
For each scheme rated, the evaluation process involved one
co-author studying the scheme and rating it on the deﬁned
beneﬁts; additional co-authors reviewing each rating score;
and iteratively reﬁning the ratings as necessary through
discussion, as noted in Section V-D.
Our focus is user authentication on the web, speciﬁcally
from unsupervised end-user client devices (e.g., a personal
computer) to remote veriﬁers. Some schemes examined
involve mobile phones as auxiliary devices, but
logging
in directly from such constrained devices, which involves
different usability challenges among other things, is not a
main focus. Our present work does not directly examine
schemes designed exclusively for machine-to-machine au-
thentication, e.g., cryptographic protocols or infrastructure
such as client public-key certiﬁcates. Many of the schemes
we examine, however, are the technologies proposed for the
human-to-machine component that may precede machine-to-
machine authentication. Our choice of web authentication
as target application also has signiﬁcant implications for
speciﬁc schemes, as noted in our results.
II. BENEFITS
The beneﬁts we consider encompass three categories:
the latter including
usability, deployability and security,
privacy aspects. The beneﬁts in our list have been reﬁned to
a set we believe highlights important evaluation dimensions,
with an eye to limiting overlap between beneﬁts.
Throughout the paper, for brevity and consistency, each
beneﬁt is referred to with an italicized mnemonic title. This
title should not be interpreted too literally; refer instead to
our actual deﬁnitions below, which are informally worded to
554
aid use. Each scheme is rated as either offering or not offer-
ing the beneﬁt; if a scheme almost offers the beneﬁt, but not
quite, we indicate this with the Quasi- preﬁx. Section V-D
discusses pros and cons of ﬁner-grained scoring.
Sometimes a particular beneﬁt (e.g., Resilient-to-Theft)
just doesn’t apply to a particular scheme (e.g.,
there is
nothing physical to steal in a scheme where the user must
memorize a secret squiggle). To simplify analysis, instead of
introducing a “not applicable” value, we rate the scheme as
offering the beneﬁt—in the sense that nothing can go wrong,
for that scheme, with respect to the corresponding problem.
When rating password-related schemes we assume that
implementers use best practice such as salting and hashing
(even though we know they often don’t [13]), because we
assess what the scheme’s design can potentially offer: a poor
implementation could otherwise kill any scheme. On the
other hand, we assume that ordinary users won’t necessarily
follow the often unreasonably inconvenient directives of
security engineers, such as never recycling passwords, or
using randomly-generated ones.
A. Usability beneﬁts
U3
U2
U1 Memorywise-Effortless: Users of the scheme do
not have to remember any secrets at all. We grant
a Quasi-Memorywise-Effortless if users have to
remember one secret for everything (as opposed
to one per veriﬁer).
Scalable-for-Users: Using the scheme for hundreds
of accounts does not increase the burden on the
user. As the mnemonic suggests, we mean “scal-
able” only from the user’s perspective, looking at
the cognitive load, not from a system deployment
perspective, looking at allocation of technical re-
sources.
Nothing-to-Carry: Users do not need to carry an
additional physical object (electronic device, me-
chanical key, piece of paper) to use the scheme.
Quasi-Nothing-to-Carry is awarded if the object
is one that they’d carry everywhere all the time
anyway, such as their mobile phone, but not if it’s
their computer (including tablets).
Physically-Effortless: The authentication process
does not require physical (as opposed to cognitive)
user effort beyond, say, pressing a button. Schemes
that don’t offer this beneﬁt
include those that
require typing, scribbling or performing a set of
motions. We grant Quasi-Physically-Effortless if
the user’s effort is limited to speaking, on the basis
that even illiterate people ﬁnd that natural to do.
Easy-to-Learn: Users who don’t know the scheme
can ﬁgure it out and learn it without too much
trouble, and then easily recall how to use it.
Efﬁcient-to-Use: The time the user must spend for
each authentication is acceptably short. The time

required for setting up a new association with
a veriﬁer, although possibly longer than that for
authentication, is also reasonable.
Infrequent-Errors: The task that users must per-
form to log in usually succeeds when performed
by a legitimate and honest user. In other words,
the scheme isn’t so hard to use or unreliable that
genuine users are routinely rejected.2
Easy-Recovery-from-Loss: A user can conveniently
regain the ability to authenticate if the token is lost
or the credentials forgotten. This combines usabil-
ity aspects such as: low latency before restored
ability; low user inconvenience in recovery (e.g.,
no requirement for physically standing in line);
and assurance that recovery will be possible, for
example via built-in backups or secondary recovery
schemes. If recovery requires some form of re-
enrollment, this beneﬁt rates its convenience.

the veriﬁer’s end,
Accessible: Users who can use passwords3 are not
prevented from using the scheme by disabilities or
other physical (not cognitive) conditions.
Negligible-Cost-per-User: The total cost per user
of the scheme, adding up the costs at both the
prover’s end (any devices required) and the veri-
ﬁer’s end (any share of the equipment and software
required), is negligible. The scheme is plausible for
startups with no per-user revenue.
Server-Compatible: At
the
scheme is compatible with text-based passwords.
Providers don’t have to change their existing au-
thentication setup to support the scheme.
Browser-Compatible: Users don’t have to change
their client to support the scheme and can ex-
pect the scheme to work when using other ma-
chines with an up-to-date, standards-compliant web
browser and no additional software. In 2012, this
would mean an HTML5-compliant browser with
JavaScript enabled. Schemes fail to provide this
beneﬁt if they require the installation of plugins
or any kind of software whose installation re-
quires administrative rights. Schemes offer Quasi-
2We could view this beneﬁt as “low false reject rate”. In many cases the
scheme designer could make the false reject rate lower by making the false
accept rate higher. If this is taken to an extreme we count it as cheating,
and penalize it through a low score in some of the security-related beneﬁts.
3Ideally a scheme would be usable by everyone, regardless of disabilities
like zero-vision (blindness) or low motor control. However, for any given
scheme, it is always possible to identify a disability or physical condition
that would exclude a category of people and then no scheme would be
granted this beneﬁt. We therefore choose to award the beneﬁt to schemes
that do at least as well as the incumbent that is de facto accepted today,
despite the fact that it too isn’t perfect. An alternative to this text password
baseline could be to base the metric on the ability to serve a deﬁned
percentage of the population of potential users.
Browser-Compatible if they rely on non-standard
but very common plugins, e.g., Flash.
D5 Mature: The scheme has been implemented and
deployed on a large scale for actual authentication
purposes beyond research. Indicators to consider
for granting the full beneﬁt may also include
whether the scheme has undergone user testing,
whether the standards community has published re-
lated documents, whether open-source projects im-
plementing the scheme exist, whether anyone other
than the implementers has adopted the scheme, the
amount of literature on the scheme and so forth.
Non-Proprietary: Anyone can implement or use
the scheme for any purpose without having to pay
royalties to anyone else. The relevant techniques
are generally known, published openly and not
protected by patents or trade secrets.

C. Security beneﬁts
An
Resilient-to-Physical-Observation: An
attacker
cannot impersonate a user after observing them
authenticate one or more times. We grant Quasi-
Resilient-to-Physical-Observation if
the scheme
could be broken only by repeating the observation
more than, say, 10–20 times. Attacks include
shoulder surﬁng, ﬁlming the keyboard, recording
keystroke sounds, or thermal imaging of keypad.
Resilient-to-Targeted-Impersonation: It is not pos-
sible for an acquaintance (or skilled investiga-
tor) to impersonate a speciﬁc user by exploiting
knowledge of personal details (birth date, names
of relatives etc.). Personal knowledge questions are
the canonical scheme that fails on this point.
Resilient-to-Throttled-Guessing:
attacker
whose rate of guessing is constrained by the
veriﬁer cannot successfully guess the secrets of a
signiﬁcant fraction of users. The veriﬁer-imposed
constraint might be enforced by an online server,
a tamper-resistant chip or any other mechanism
capable of throttling repeated requests. To give a
quantitative example, we might grant this beneﬁt
if an attacker constrained to, say, 10 guesses per
account per day, could compromise at most 1% of
accounts in a year. Lack of this beneﬁt is meant
to penalize schemes in which it is frequent for
user-chosen secrets to be selected from a small
and well-known subset (low min-entropy [14]).
Resilient-to-Unthrottled-Guessing: An
attacker
whose rate of guessing is constrained only by
available computing resources cannot successfully
guess the secrets of a signiﬁcant fraction of users.
We might for example grant
if an
attacker capable of attempting up to 240 or even
264 guesses per account could still only reach
this beneﬁt

it
fewer than 1% of accounts. Lack of this beneﬁt
is meant
to penalize schemes where the space
of credentials is not large enough to withstand
brute force search (including dictionary attacks,
rainbow tables and related brute force methods
smarter than raw exhaustive search, if credentials
are user-chosen secrets).
Resilient-to-Internal-Observation: An attacker can-
not impersonate a user by intercepting the user’s
input from inside the user’s device (e.g., by key-
logging malware) or eavesdropping on the clear-
text communication between prover and veriﬁer
(we assume that
the attacker can also defeat
TLS if
is used, perhaps through the CA).
As with Resilient-to-Physical-Observation above,
we grant Quasi-Resilient-to-Internal-Observation
