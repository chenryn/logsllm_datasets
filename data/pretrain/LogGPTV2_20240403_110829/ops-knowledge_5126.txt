User: Assuming you have a MySQL database, how do you use Python for data analysis and visualization?
Assistant: 1. Install MySQL and Python, and install the MySQL-Python library 2. Connect to the MySQL database, use Python to operate the database, for example, query the data in the table 3. Use the data analysis library in Python (such as Pandas) for preliminary data processing and Analysis 4. Use visualization libraries (such as Matplotlib or Seaborn) for data visualization to realize the transformation of data into visual graphics 5. Interactive visualization through interactive data visualization libraries (such as Plotly) as needed 6. Use Python web frameworks (such as Django or Flask) to display the results in a web browser 7. Write and execute code in Jupyter Notebook or iPython as needed, which will make the code visualized and documented, and easy to share and copy for execution
