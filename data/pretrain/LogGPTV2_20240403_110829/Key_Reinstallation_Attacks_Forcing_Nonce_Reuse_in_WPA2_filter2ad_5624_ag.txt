of both the 4-way handshake and the group key handshake [39].
However, they did not explicitly model cipher selection and down-
grade protection. This enabled Vanhoef and Piessens to carry out a
downgrade attack against the 4-way handshake [72]. In their attack,
the AP is tricked into using RC4 to encrypt the group key when
it is transported in message 3. This attack is only possible if the
network supports WPA-TKIP, which was already known to be a
weak cipher [66, 69]. Additionally, the models employed in [39] do
not define when to install the negotiated session key or transported
group key. However, we showed this timing is in fact essential,
since otherwise key reinstallation attacks may be possible.
The FT handshake is based on the 4-way handshake [5], but there
are no formal security analysis of it. Instead, existing works focus
on the performance of the handshake, examples being [11, 46].
Several works study authentication mechanisms which negotiate
master keys (PMKs) [19, 21, 59, 75]. Some of these mechanisms rely
on first establishing a secure TLS session [9]. As a result, recent
attacks on TLS also affect these mechanisms, examples being [10, 14,
15, 27, 62]. In this paper we did not study mechanisms that negotiate
master keys, but instead focused on handshakes that derive fresh
session keys from such a negotiated or pre-shared master key.
Regarding data-confidentiality protocols, the first practical attack
on WPA-TKIP was found by Beck and Tews [66]. They showed
how to decrypt a small TKIP packet, recovered the MIC key, and
subsequently forged packets. Their attack was further improved
in several works [36, 67, 69, 70]. Researchers also attacked the
weak per-packet key construction of TKIP by exploiting biases in
RC4 [6, 57, 71]. Nowadays TKIP is deprecated by the Wi-Fi Alliance
due to its security issues [74].
Although CCMP received some criticism [60], it has been proven
to provide security guarantees similar to modes such as OCB [42].
In [31], Fouque et al. discusses theoretic message forging attacks
when nonces are repeated in CCMP.
The GCM cipher is known to be weak when short authentication
tags are used [29], and when nonces are reused [43]. Böck et al. em-
pirically investigate nonce reuse when GCM is used in TLS [16], and
discovered several servers that reuse nonces. Our attack on GCMP
in 802.11 is unique because we can control when an endpoint reuses
a nonce, and because GCMP uses the same (authentication) key in
both communication directions. Several cryptographers recently
referred to GCM as fragile [35, 56].
Finally, other works highlighted security issues in either Wi-Fi
implementations or surrounding technologies. For example, design
flaws were discovered in Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) [73], vulner-
abilities were found in drivers [13, 20], routers were found to be
using predictable pre-shared keys [45], and and so on.
8 CONCLUSION
Despite the security proof of both the 4-way and group key hand-
shake, we showed that they are vulnerable to key reinstallation
attacks. These attacks do not violate the security properties of the
formal proofs, but highlight limitations of the models employed by
them. In particular, the models do not specify when a key should be
installed for usage by the data-confidentiality protocol. Addition-
ally, we showed that the PeerKey and fast BSS transition handshake
are vulnerable to key reinstallation attacks.
All Wi-Fi clients we tested were vulnerable to our attack against
the group key handshake. This enables an adversary to replay
broadcast and multicast frames. When the 4-way or fast BSS tran-
sition handshake is attacked, the precise impact depends on the
data-confidentiality protocol being used. In all cases though, it is
possible to decrypt frames and thus hijack TCP connections. This
enables the injection of data into unencrypted HTTP connections.
Moreover, against Android 6.0 our attack triggered the installation
of an all-zero key, completely voiding any security guarantees.
Rather worryingly, our key reinstallation attack even occurs
spontaneously if certain handshake messages are lost due to back-
ground noise. This means that under certain conditions, implemen-
tations are reusing nonces without an adversary being present.
An interesting future research direction is to determine whether
other protocol implementations are also vulnerable to key rein-
stallation attacks. Protocols that appear particularly vulnerable are
those that must take into account that messages may be lost. After
all, these protocols are explicitly designed to process retransmitted
frames, and are possibly reinstalling keys while doing so.
