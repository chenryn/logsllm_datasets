Figure 2: Credit card arrivals.
Credit Card Arrivals: Measurement Methodology. To establish
the number of credit cards in the channel, we measure the rate at
which new data enters the channel and the rate at which previously
seen cards are repeated. Repetition is typically the result of chan-
nel participants providing the same data sample multiple times, or
card numbers being repeated in requests to and responses from the
channel services bot.
Credit Card Arrivals: Measurement Results. Figure 2 shows the
arrival rates of potentially valid cards which pass the Luhn check
and invalid cards which fail the Luhn check. Valid cards arrive
with an average rate of 402 cards per day or close to 17 cards per
hour with a standard deviation of 145 cards per day. Invalid cards
arrive at an average rate of 88 cards per day. The arrival of valid
card numbers at a steady rate for over 200 straight days seems to
imply that miscreants either continuously collect card data through
activities such as phishing or compromising merchant databases, or
that miscreants possess large numbers of stolen cards. The regular

arrival of invalid cards suggests that some novice miscreants lack
sufﬁcient knowledge or sophistication to use one of the many pub-
licly available programs which generate card numbers with valid
Luhn digits.
Credit Card Repetition, Lifetime, and Sources: Measurement
Methodology. To better understand the card data seen in the mar-
ket, we measure the arrival rate of repeats, the lifetime of a card,
deﬁned as the time between the ﬁrst and last post, and the number
of sources which post each card. The lifetime and source measure-
ments include cards with both valid and invalid Luhn digits. For
the source measurement, we use the full source identiﬁer including
the IRC nick, username or Ident ﬁeld, and hostname as the atom of
client identiﬁcation.
Credit Card Repetition, Lifetime, and Sources: Measurement
Results.
Figure 3(a) shows repeated cards arriving over an or-
der of magnitude faster than cards with valid Luhn digits at an av-
erage rate of 4,272 cards per day. The majority of cards are re-
peated fewer than 4 times and 95% of cards are repeated fewer
than 34 times. Figure 3(b) shows that over 40% of all card num-
bers are seen within a half-hour period and the majority of cards
are exposed for six hours or less. Figure 3(c) shows the number
of sources per card. Around 17% of cards are posted by a single
source (non-repeats) and the majority of cards are posted by 4 or
fewer sources. The limited number of repetitions per card, the lim-
ited lifetime of most cards, and the small number of sources which
post each card suggests that repeating the same data sample over
and over is of limited use. It is possible that once pasted, the en-
tire available credit limit is quickly spent or the card is removed
from service by fraud prevention services monitoring the channel
or monitoring card activity.
Bank Identiﬁcation Number: Measurement Methodology. For
each unique credit card seen in the channel, we look up the bank
identiﬁcation number (BIN) information to ascertain the country of
the issuing bank. The ﬁrst six digits of a credit card, called a BIN
or Issuer Identiﬁcation Number (IIN), uniquely identify the coun-
try of the issuing bank, bank or organization name, funding type
(Credit, Debit, or Prepaid), and card type (e.g., Classic, Gold, etc.).
American Express and Discover cards do not include BIN numbers
because, unlike Visas and Mastercards, they are not distributed by
networks of banks but by individual companies.
The ofﬁcial BIN number database is not available to the public.
We use a BIN list containing information for 52,492 issuing banks
of Visas and Mastercards which we acquired as part of the source
code of a channel service bot. We crosscheck our BIN list by look-
ing up a small percentage (0.1%) of the BINs in a BIN database1,
1http://www.bindatabase.com
currently being created as part of a community effort to publicize
BIN information. We were unable to look up every BIN from the
underground list in the public database since it limits the number of
BIN lookups from an unique IP address to around 10 a day. When
performing validation of our BIN list, the country and bank names
in the public database exactly matched the underground data.
Bank Identiﬁcation Number: Measurement Results. To assess
the extent to which credit card data from around the world ﬁnds its
way into the market, we look up the country of the issuing bank
of each unique Visa and Mastercard with valid Luhn digits. Of
11,649 unique BINs, 2,998 BINs representing 7.3% of Visa and
13.9% of Mastercards are not found in the BIN list. The results of
our measurements are presented in Figure 4.
As one might expect of a market with a stated “English Only”
policy, the majority of cards were from issuing banks in the United
States (62,142) and the United Kingdom (3,977). Other countries
with greater than 200 occurrences include Canada, Brazil, Aus-
tralia, France, Germany, and Malaysia. While the country of origin
of the issuing bank is not always the country where the card is cur-
rently being used nor the country where the data was compromised,
the number of countries represented in the data suggests that the
market has global data sources and that the market’s participants
are likely to be dispersed around the world.
Further evidence that the market is international can be found in
the details of ads from the participants. Ads often carry restrictions
on the type of data wanted or being offered or the type of buyer
required. Examples include buyers placing thousands of requests
for cards from Japan, Italy, India, and Pakistan and sellers whose
ads include warnings such as “No nigerians or romanians!” and
more colorfully worded restrictions.
3.1.2 Financial Data
In addition to credit card data, other ﬁnancial data seen in the
channel includes checking and savings account numbers and bal-
ances. Miscreants often post text which they purport to be copied
directly from a ﬁnancial account access webpages and tout screen
captures of account webpages to attest to their ability to access an
account with a particular balance.
Financial Data: Measurement Methodology. To quantify the
dollar value of the ﬁnancial data posted, we sum the checking, sav-
ings, mortgage, and balance ﬁgures. We add each unique dollar
amount only once to prevent double counting of balances, even
across categories. While pasting ﬁnancial account balances is triv-
ial to fake and difﬁcult to validate, the practice is used by honest
sellers to advertise actual accounts for sale. We are unable to verify
the percentage of posts which are valid.
