### Designation of Internet Service Provider and Data Sources

The abbreviation "AOL" is used to designate the Internet service provider America Online and to flag data derived from AOL subscribers. Additionally, we identified tens of thousands of instances of shipping instructions embedded with delimited data, which appear to be extracted from a formatted file or database containing e-merchant order information.

### Credit Card Arrivals: Measurement Methodology

To determine the number of credit cards in the channel, we measure the rate at which new data enters the channel and the rate at which previously seen cards are repeated. Repetition typically occurs when channel participants provide the same data sample multiple times or when card numbers are repeated in requests to and responses from the channel services bot.

### Credit Card Arrivals: Measurement Results

Figure 2 illustrates the arrival rates of potentially valid and invalid credit cards. Valid cards, which pass the Luhn check, arrive at an average rate of 402 cards per day (approximately 17 cards per hour) with a standard deviation of 145 cards per day. Invalid cards, which fail the Luhn check, arrive at an average rate of 88 cards per day. The consistent arrival of valid card numbers over 200 days suggests that miscreants either continuously collect card data through activities such as phishing or by compromising merchant databases, or they possess large numbers of stolen cards. The regular arrival of invalid cards indicates that some novice miscreants lack the knowledge or sophistication to use publicly available programs that generate card numbers with valid Luhn digits.

### Credit Card Repetition, Lifetime, and Sources: Measurement Methodology

To better understand the card data in the market, we measure the arrival rate of repeats, the lifetime of a card (defined as the time between the first and last post), and the number of sources posting each card. These measurements include cards with both valid and invalid Luhn digits. For source identification, we use the full source identifier, including the IRC nickname, username, or Ident field, and hostname.

### Credit Card Repetition, Lifetime, and Sources: Measurement Results

Figure 3(a) shows that repeated cards arrive at an average rate of 4,272 cards per day, which is over an order of magnitude faster than cards with valid Luhn digits. The majority of cards are repeated fewer than four times, and 95% of cards are repeated fewer than 34 times. Figure 3(b) indicates that over 40% of all card numbers are seen within a half-hour period, and the majority of cards are exposed for six hours or less. Figure 3(c) shows the number of sources per card, with around 17% of cards posted by a single source (non-repeats) and the majority posted by four or fewer sources. The limited repetitions per card, the short lifetime of most cards, and the small number of sources suggest that repeatedly posting the same data sample is of limited use. It is possible that once pasted, the entire available credit limit is quickly spent, or the card is removed from service by fraud prevention services monitoring the channel or card activity.

### Bank Identification Number (BIN): Measurement Methodology

For each unique credit card seen in the channel, we look up the bank identification number (BIN) information to ascertain the country of the issuing bank. The first six digits of a credit card, called a BIN or Issuer Identification Number (IIN), uniquely identify the country of the issuing bank, bank or organization name, funding type (Credit, Debit, or Prepaid), and card type (e.g., Classic, Gold, etc.). American Express and Discover cards do not include BIN numbers because, unlike Visas and Mastercards, they are not distributed by networks of banks but by individual companies.

The official BIN number database is not publicly available. We use a BIN list containing information for 52,492 issuing banks of Visas and Mastercards, acquired as part of the source code of a channel service bot. We crosscheck our BIN list by looking up a small percentage (0.1%) of the BINs in a public BIN database currently being created as part of a community effort to publicize BIN information. Due to daily lookup limits, we were unable to verify every BIN from the underground list in the public database. However, during validation, the country and bank names in the public database exactly matched the underground data.

### Bank Identification Number (BIN): Measurement Results

To assess the global reach of the market, we looked up the country of the issuing bank for each unique Visa and Mastercard with valid Luhn digits. Of 11,649 unique BINs, 2,998 BINs (representing 7.3% of Visa and 13.9% of Mastercards) were not found in the BIN list. The results are presented in Figure 4.

As expected in a market with an "English Only" policy, the majority of cards were from issuing banks in the United States (62,142) and the United Kingdom (3,977). Other countries with more than 200 occurrences include Canada, Brazil, Australia, France, Germany, and Malaysia. While the country of origin of the issuing bank does not always indicate where the card is used or where the data was compromised, the number of countries represented suggests that the market has global data sources and that participants are likely dispersed worldwide.

Further evidence of the market's international nature can be found in the details of ads from participants. Ads often carry restrictions on the type of data wanted or offered, or the type of buyer required. Examples include buyers placing thousands of requests for cards from Japan, Italy, India, and Pakistan, and sellers' ads including warnings such as "No Nigerians or Romanians!" and other colorful restrictions.

### Financial Data

In addition to credit card data, the channel also includes other financial data, such as checking and savings account numbers and balances. Miscreants often post text purporting to be copied directly from financial account access webpages and tout screen captures of account webpages to attest to their ability to access an account with a particular balance.

### Financial Data: Measurement Methodology

To quantify the dollar value of the financial data posted, we sum the checking, savings, mortgage, and balance figures. We add each unique dollar amount only once to prevent double counting of balances, even across categories. While pasting financial account balances is trivial to fake and difficult to validate, the practice is used by honest sellers to advertise actual accounts for sale. We are unable to verify the percentage of posts that are valid.

### Summary of Findings

- **Credit Card Arrivals**: Valid cards arrive at a steady rate, suggesting continuous data collection or possession of large numbers of stolen cards.
- **Card Repetition and Lifetime**: Repeated cards are common, but their short lifetime and limited sources suggest limited utility in repeated postings.
- **Bank Identification Numbers (BIN)**: The market includes cards from a wide range of countries, indicating a global data source.
- **Financial Data**: Checking and savings account information is also traded, though the validity of these posts is difficult to verify.

These findings highlight the global and dynamic nature of the market, with participants from various countries and a mix of valid and invalid data.
