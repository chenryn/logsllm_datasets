User: So I'm writing Python with IDLE and my usual workflow is to have two windows (an editor and a console), and run my script with F5 to quickly test it.
My script has some non-optional command line parameters, and I have two conflicting desires:

If someone launches my script without passing any parameters, I'd like him to get an error telling him to do so (argparse does this well)
When I hit F5 in IDLE, I'd like to have my script run with dummy parameters (and I don't want to have more keystrokes than F5 to have this work, and I don't want to have a piece of code I have to remember to remove when I'm not debugging any more)

So far my solution has been that if I get no parameters, I look for a params.debug file (that's not under source control), and if so, take that as default params, but it's a bit ugly... so would there be a cleaner, more "standard" solution to this? Do other IDEs offer easier ways of doing this?
Other solutions I can think of: environment variables, having a separate "launcher" script that's the one taking the "official" parameters.
(I'm likely to try out another IDE anyway)
Assistant: Thanks for your question. I also searched for a way to do this. I found that Spyder which is the IDE I use has an option under Run/Configure to enter the command line parameters for running the program. You can even configure different ones for the different editors you have open.
