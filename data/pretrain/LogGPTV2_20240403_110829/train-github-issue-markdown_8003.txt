##### Description of the problem
JSFiddle here
I record the performance in Chrome when running this JSFiddle, it shows:  
![1024x1024](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/24999464/26337944/05272af4-3faf-11e7-8e3f-362e38a151f1.png)  
The memory peak value getting higher and higher, but the valley value always
keeps a low value.
Then uncomment the two lines in line number 30 and 31:
    width = 1000;
    height = 1100;
The canvas size is not power of two, and the memory usage increases rapidly
the performance record shows:  
![1000x1100](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/24999464/26337947/0bbb0e3a-3faf-11e7-9da3-ab832b9eaeb1.png)  
The memory peak value and valley value both getting higher and higher.
I call the dispose method of material and texture explicitly, and remove the
mesh from scene in every loop.
