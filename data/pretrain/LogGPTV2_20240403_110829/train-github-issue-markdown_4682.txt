### First Check
  * I added a very descriptive title to this issue.
  * I used the GitHub search to find a similar issue and didn't find it.
  * I searched the FastAPI documentation, with the integrated search.
  * I already searched in Google "How to X in FastAPI" and didn't find any information.
  * I already read and followed all the tutorial in the docs and didn't find an answer.
  * I already checked if it is not related to FastAPI but to Pydantic.
  * I already checked if it is not related to FastAPI but to Swagger UI.
  * I already checked if it is not related to FastAPI but to ReDoc.

### Example Code
    No code, it's a documentation correction (possibly).
### Description
FastAPI's documentation, in it's "Python Types/Pydantic models" section says:
> Pydantic is a Python library to perform data validation.
>
> You declare the "shape" of the data as classes with attributes.
>
> And each attribute has a type.
>
> Then you create an instance of that class with some values and it will
> validate the values, convert them to the appropriate type (if that's the
> case) and give you an object with all the data.
But Pydantic's documentation, in the "Models" section notes that:
> pydantic is primarily a parsing library, **not a validation library**.
> Validation is a means to an end: building a model which conforms to the
> types and constraints provided.
Then FastAPI's documentation could be rewritten this way:
> Pydantic is a Python library to perform data parsing.
>
> You declare the "shape" of the data as classes with attributes.
>
> And each attribute has a type.
>
> Then you create an instance of that class with some values and it will parse
> the values, convert them to the appropriate type (if that's the case) and
> give you an object with all the data.
I did not send a pull request right away because I think it may have been
written this way to facilitate the understanding but I think that it's better
to be technically correct.
