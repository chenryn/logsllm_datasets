Reviewer #1 
Strengths:	Novel measurement study that compares satellite and 
cellular links at remote places. Well written paper and interesting 
to read.  
Weaknesses: Cannot generalize these results as the study is too 
specific to those particular locations in the southwest US. 
Comments  to  Authors:  The  paper  is  an  interesting  study  of 
cellular and satellite network connectivity at oil field locations. It 
is of course hard to generalize the results to other locations, but 
trends  of  expanding  cellular 
sheds 
infrastructure 
to  be  a  more  compelling 
alternative  to  more  expensive  satellite  links.  I  like  this  general 
thesis of the paper.  
I have only one major comment regarding the experimentation. It 
might  be  good  to  use  the  job  transition  and  equipment  down 
schedules  from  the  crews  to  weed  out  periods  of  planned 
unavailability.  Right  now,  the  paper  reads  a  bit speculative. For 
instance,  the  reasons  for  the  longer  tail  in  Figure  4  are  vaguely 
attributed to these causes. It might be good to separate them out 
so  that  results  are  more  reflective  of  actual  availability  of  the 
links.  Of  course  it  might  be  a  bit  harder since somebody has to 
collect those logs!  
P3: I don’t understand how the author’s results can serve as the 
basis  for  future  effort  on  “tuning”  TCP  stack.  It  would be good 
clarify.  
Table 1 needs units for upload and download bandwidths. Are the 
coverage results based on actual measurements or coverage maps 
from ATT and Verizon ?  
P3:  1dB  gain  in  signal  strength  translates  to  28.4  Kbps  in 
download  speed  and  7kbps  in  upload  speed.  1dB  gain  due  to 
multiple antennas is 15% download speed increment. It’s not easy 
to see the comparison between absolute and relative increments. 
Please standardize. 
Reviewer #2 
Strengths:  Understanding  network  access  in  remote/non  urban 
areas sounds like a new emerging area. 
Weaknesses:  I  am  not  sure  any  of  the  findings  have  much 
generality  or  application  to  other  networking  problems.  The 
results or techniques are not particularly surprising or interesting. 
Comments  to  Authors:  I  am  all  in  favor  of  emerging  problem 
areas and you seem to have the potential to do so with your setup. 
Unfortunately,  there  is  not  much  interesting  networking  in  this 
paper.  It  would  be  nice  if  you  can  use  your  measurements  to 
develop new insights or implications for networking -- e.g., how 
can  you  use  a  hybrid  cellular-satellite  combination  or  how  can 
DTN  help  or  how  should  a  TCP  stack  be  optimized  etc.  Sadly, 
this is missing here.  
You mention “high availability” of cellular, but that seems likely 
biased by the coverage/workload for the providers and what their 
economic and business considerations are. I am not sure how we 
can generalize this to other settings or deployments  
Reviewer #3 
Strengths:  One  step  in  a  new  environment:  how  to  build 
communication  network  at  lower  cost  for  remote  areas  and 
operational deployment of oil company. The need for information 
in this system needs to be on the rise. Big deployment effort. Four 
teams  are  covered  with  different  schedules,  and  different 
providers and satellite are used for completion. Points to need for 
better  accommodation  of  delay  in  application,  and  the  role  of 
different factors. 
Weaknesses: Apart from the obvious benefit for the operational 
cost  of  the  oil  company,  the  depth  of  the  problem  is  not  made 
very  precise.  In  particular,  since  satellite  already  have  longer 
delay  and  more  sporadic  availability,  it  seems  that  switching  to 
cellular is not going much more into the DTN area. The cellular 
network  seems  to  underperform  the  satellite  in  terms  of  raw 
bandwidth  (through  is  generally  below  70kbps).  It  is  a  little 
frustrating  that  unavailability  due  to  hardware  switched  off  (or 
non operation of the team) is not factored out from the experience 
altogether. 
Comments to Authors: I think this paper is a good fit for a short 
communication at IMC since it deals with measuring availability 
in a new context (operational team of oil field) and brings several 
insights  on  a  potential  new  area  of  applications  for  wireless 
system.  This  work  seems  in  an  early  phase,  as  the  result  are 
somewhat limited (old technology from satellite are shown to be 
more  expensive  but  more  predictable).  The  main  surprising 
message  is  that  availability  of  cellular  networks  is  higher  than 
satellite.  
I  think  the  work  can  benefit  from  clarifying  a  few  issues,  in 
particular  with  regard  to  its  conclusion  for  future  research.  This 
could potentially be included in the paper with a little time.  
What are the factors to include in the satellite availability? Is that 
mostly a hardware and deployment issue (directional antenna and 
failure) or a fundamental limitation (moving satellites that are not 
always  present).  Distinguishing  these  factors  (even  roughly)  to 
tell what’s counted and what is not would help.  
124Similarly, as a sanity check it would be important to at least say a 
word about unavailability due to non-work. Are the trucks left in 
a place with coverage (in that case, we should see that at night for 
SLA2).  Is  that guaranteed that both satellite and cellular are off 
then?  
The time where the power is off, it seems to indicate that the radio 
is also off. Hence it should be able to find that in the data itself 
and factor it out.  
Can  you  specify  your  related  improvement  w.r.t.  [5]  and  [7].  It 
seems  that  [7]  already  proposed  to  use  cellular  network  for  oil 
field, so it would be important to contrast your finding or system.  
Can  you  elaborate  on  the  impact  of  unavailability.  Apparently, 
satellite  links  are  more  sporadic  (but  more  predictable  when 
available)  than  cellular  link.  That  seems  to  indicate  that  they 
would already benefit from DTN. Maybe the cellular network is 
not making a strong case then. Unless the variability of available 
throughput is making DTN a must.  
For these reasons, the unavailability duration of satellite should be 
discussed  along  with  Fig.4.  while  Fig.2  seems  not  to  be  critical 
and left to a tech report.  
Clearly  the  impact  of  cellular  coverage  is  huge  here.  If  it  is 
modified  by  20%  then  the  result  of  availability  will  be  strongly 
modified.  Can  you  at  least  have  a  quick  back  of  the  envelope 
calculation to prove that other locations considered for oil fields 
(mentioned in introduction) are not much less exposed to cellular 
service? That would help making the result representative.  
The fact that the entropy reduces as a significant parameter like 
the time of the day is used seems trivial. This section seems not to 
add much to the paper at this time (although the general problem 
of prediction could be important).  
Since  cellular  is  better  for  coverage  but  less  for  instantaneous 
throughput,  a  total  comparison  of  the  volume  that  can  be 
transported would be useful. 
Reviewer #4 
Strengths:  This  is  the  first  paper  I  am  aware  of  that  compares 
satellite  and  cellular  network  performance  in  remote  rural 
settings. The paper topic is of interest, as it provides insights into 
a new aspect of Internet use. 
Weaknesses:  The  presentation  needs  significant  copy  editing 
(normally I provide a list of specific issues to correct, but in this 
case it needs a native English speaker to work directly with the 
authors  (actually,  at  least  one  of  the  authors  appears  to  fit  this 
description, and thus should be able to do this). The analyses are 
perhaps  less  rigorous  than  is  typically  expected  of  IMC  papers, 
but given the challenges in obtaining the measurements, are likely 
acceptable for a short paper. 
Comments to Authors: The most glaring issue with the paper is 
the need for copy editing. There are many, many minor language 
issues that need to be corrected. Fixing these will make the paper 
much more enjoyable for a wider audience. There is also quite a 
bit of repetition in the paper (e.g., about conducting a study with 
12 sites, then a follow-up study with four sites). 
Please  provide  more  insights  on  how  the  initial  12  sites  were 
selected, and then how the final four were selected. 
this 
In  Section  3.1,  please  explain  in  more  detail  the  benefits  of  an 
additional  5db  from  the  flexible antenna. Keep in mind that not 
everyone  who  reads  this  paper  may  understand  signal  strength 
measurements. 
In Section 3.2, is ftp really used in operations? that is an insecure 
protocol.  if  you  meant  sftp  or  something  similar,  please  be 
specific. 
 It would be helpful to have a table that summarizes the data sets; 
e.g., how many flows are in each. 
The  cost  information  is  very  interesting;  it  serves  as  a  good 
motivation. Thus, you may want to mention this in Section 1. 
Figure  6(b)  is  very  interesting.  Please  make  it  at  least  column 
width.  This  graph  suggests  that  some  changes  to  business 
practices/policies may be required; e.g., leaving the IT equipment 
on at night to take advantage of the increased data rates. 
Please clarify what value the entropy analysis provides over the 
straightforward graph in Figure 6(b). 
As future work, I think passive measurement techniques should be 
explored,  since 
is  clearly  a  bandwidth  constrained 
environment. Obviously, it would require the network to be in use 
for  business  purposes,  and  then  that  traffic  would  be  passively 
monitored. 
Reviewer #5 
Strengths: The practical nature of this work makes it interesting. 
It  is  nice  to  see  work  aimed  at  solving  a  real  problem  (data 
connectivity on oilfields). 
Weaknesses: The paper lacks real insight, and it is just too poorly 
written to really merit attention in IMC. 
Comments  to  Authors:  Apart  from  very  frequent  problems  in 
English,  it  is  hard  from the start to understand exactly what the 
problem being solved here.  
If it is connectivity in remote locations, then how is AT&T or any 
other  service  provider  relevant.  At  really  remote  locations,  e.g., 
and  oil  rig  at  sea,  such  as  in  the  motivating  citation  to  the  BP 
disaster, then clearly a commercial data service is unlikely to be a 
viable option.  
If the question is how well does 3G and related data services work 
near the edge of their range, then the paper doesn’t really answer 
that because we don’t know the positions of cell centers relative 
to measurements.  
Are  you  proposing  that  cellular  data  be  installed  at  remote 
locations for oil field operators? Even so, the data would have to 
be backhauled by some technology, e.g., satellite.  
These  questions  aside,  a  large  part  of  the  performance  which  is 
diurnal is probably dominated by usage of the cell by other users. 
That hardly seems relevant to any of the problems above. 
Response from the Authors 
(1)  Generality  of  contributions  (Reviewers  1,  2,  3  and  5):  The 
paper’s  contribution  is  in  exploring  the  potential  for  less  costly 
125cellular  data  usage  at  remote  sites  where  such  usage  has  not 
traditionally been contemplated. It is clear that there is significant 
diversity  in  availability  of  cellular  and  satellite  coverage among 
remote locations. Our goal in this paper is to provide a framework 
for  assessing  this  availability  through  systematic  measurement 
and  evaluation  and  analyzing  instances  of  this    framework  at 
different geographical locations. 
(2)  Filtering  data  based  on  job  transition  and  equipment 
downtimes  (Reviewers  1  and  3):  We  retrieved  Windows  OS’s 
native  logs  containing  PC  power  on/off  events  from  different 
crews.  With this type of information, we reprocessed availability 
logs of cellular and satellite interfaces and eliminated the effect of 
job 
availability 
comparison. 
(3)  About  optimizing  the  TCP  stack  (Reviewers  1  and  2): 
Although optimization of TCP performance is outside the scope 
of this paper, we added end-to-end latency measurements in the 
final  paper,  which  shows  high  variation  across  different 
interfaces.  This  indicates  a  specially  designed  TCP  stack  which 
adapts  to  high  latency  variation  might  have  better  performance 
over  the  default  TCP  stack  of  Windows  OS  in  such  a  multi-
interface system. 
(4)  Discussion  on  entropy  analysis  (Reviewers  3  and  4):    We 
removed  the  discussion  on  entropy  analysis  about  bandwidth 
transition/equipment  down 
schedule  on 
prediction  as  the  information  presented  in  this    analysis  can  be 
found in other parts of the paper as reviewers pointed out. 
(5) Writing and presentation (Reviewers 4 and 5): Several rounds 
of  editing  were  applied  to  the  final  version  of  this  paper  to 
improve the English and presentation. 
(6)  Clarification  of  Table  1  (Reviewer  1):  Clarification  of 
coverage  results  in  Table  1  is  provided  and  the  unit  of 
measurement is also added. 
(7)  Hybrid  cellular  and  satellite  usage  (Reviewer  2):    The 
methodology we developed in this measurement study is actually 
used to provide a simple link management scheme.  Therefore, an 
application can select among interfaces based on their availability 
and a pre-determined preference. 
(8)  Measurement  location/crew  selection  (Reviewer  4):    We’ve 
added  a  discussion  on  the  criteria  and  process  of  location/crew 
selection. 
(9) Cellular link’s availability is questionable at certain locations 
(Reviewer 5):  Our objective is not replacing satellite links with 
cellular  links  or  vice  versa.  On  the  contrary,    our  measurement 
framework  shows  that  highly-available  and  cost-effective  data 
communication may be achieved  via a multi-interface system.
