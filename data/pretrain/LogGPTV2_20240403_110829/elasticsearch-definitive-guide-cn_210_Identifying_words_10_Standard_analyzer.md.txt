=== standard Analyzer
The `standard` analyzer is used by default for any full-text `analyzed` string
field. ((("standard analyzer"))) If we were to reimplement the  `standard` analyzer as a
>, it would be defined as follows:
[role="pagebreak-before"]
[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
    "type":      "custom",
    "tokenizer": "standard",
    "filter":  [ "lowercase", "stop" ]
}
--------------------------------------------------
In > and >, we talk about the
`lowercase`, and `stop` _token filters_, but for the moment, let's focus on
the `standard` _tokenizer_.
