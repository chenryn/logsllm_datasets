### Title: The Rise of Potatoes: Privilege Escalations in Windows Services

**Abstract:**

Privilege escalation is a critical step for an attacker to gain full control of a system, starting from a lower-privileged access. In the Windows environment, there are numerous methods to achieve this goal. This presentation will focus on recent techniques used for privilege escalation, specifically when starting from a service account. This scenario is particularly relevant when targeting web applications hosted on Windows servers. Once a web server is compromised (through code execution or arbitrary file write), an attacker can execute commands as the service running the web server. Similarly, MSSQL servers are another example of services that can be exploited by malicious actors.

**Windows Service Hardening (WSH):**

Introduced with Windows Vista, WSH aims to enhance the security of services through various "isolation" techniques. However, these measures are often not fully implemented and, in some cases, can be abused. A notable example is the Rotten/JuicyPotato exploit, which leverages the DCOM/NTLM reflection vulnerability. These techniques require the `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, which Microsoft considers a high-privilege right. By default, this privilege is assigned to any service account, creating a potential vulnerability that attackers can exploit to escalate privileges.

Microsoft does not classify the boundary between a service with `SeImpersonate` and SYSTEM as a security boundary but rather as a safety boundary. Consequently, such vulnerabilities are often categorized as "won't fix" by Microsoft.

**Presentation Overview:**

This talk will delve into the latest techniques for privilege escalation, demonstrating how it is still possible to escalate privileges from a service account to SYSTEM in multiple ways. Additionally, the presentation will provide mitigation strategies, emphasizing the importance of not relying solely on default service account configurations for segregating services and processes.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Understanding the common scenarios where privilege escalation from a service account occurs.
- Insight into the Rotten/JuicyPotato exploit and other similar techniques.
- Best practices and mitigations to protect against these types of attacks.

By the end of the session, attendees will have a comprehensive understanding of the current landscape of privilege escalation in Windows services and practical steps to enhance their system's security.
