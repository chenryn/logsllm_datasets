User: I have Python script bgservice.py and I want it to run all the time, because it is part of the web service I build. How can I make it run continuously even after I logout SSH?
Assistant: If you've already started the process, and don't want to kill it and restart under nohup, you can send it to the background, then disown it.
Ctrl+Z  (suspend the process)
bg   (restart the process in the background
disown %1 (assuming this is job #1, use jobs to determine)
