### 4.2 Hypotheses

As a distributed system handling 70,000 posts per minute, Weibo experiences a deletion rate of over 10% in the public timeline. This high deletion rate can be attributed to various processes, including anti-spam measures, user deletions, and anti-censorship features. In our dataset, 40% of deletions occur within the first hour after a post is published, indicating that Weibo exerts significant control over its content.

**Hypothesis 1:** Weibo employs filtering mechanisms as a proactive, automated defense.

To investigate the presence of filtering mechanisms, we attempted to post content containing sensitive words from the China Digital Times [4] and Tao et al. [41]. Our observations revealed the following filtering methods:

- **Explicit Filtering:** Weibo directly informs users that their post cannot be released due to sensitive content. For example, on August 1, 2012, attempting to post "政法委书记" (Secretary of the Political and Legislative Committee) resulted in a warning message stating, "Sorry, since this content violates 'Sina Weibo regulation rules' or a related regulation or policy, this operation cannot be processed. If you need help, please contact customer service."

- **Implicit Filtering:** Weibo sometimes suspends posts for manual review, citing "server data synchronization." For instance, posting "youshenmefalundebanfa" on August 1, 2012, resulted in a message: "Your post has been submitted successfully. Currently, there is a delay caused by server data synchronization. Please wait for 1 to 2 minutes. Thank you very much." The actual delay was over 5 hours, triggered by the use of the substring "falun," related to the Falun Gong religion.

- **Camouflaged Posts:** Weibo may make it appear to the user that their post was successfully published, but other users cannot see it. For example, posting "cgc" (Chen Guangcheng [31]) on August 1, 2012, showed no warning messages, but the post was not visible to other accounts, redirecting them to an error page.

These phenomena were consistently observed across multiple experiments with different subsets of keywords from the China Digital Times [4].

**Figure 1:** Deletions occur most frequently within 5 to 10 minutes of a post being published. To estimate the human labor required for such a process, assuming an efficient worker can read 50 posts per minute, 1,400 simultaneous workers would be needed to handle 70,000 new posts per minute. Over an 8-hour shift, 4,200 workers would be required, which is impractical and expensive. Therefore, Weibo likely uses a significant amount of automation, possibly keyword-based, as seen in systems like TOM-Skype [16].

**Hypothesis 2:** Weibo targets specific users, such as those who frequently post sensitive content.

To test this hypothesis, we plotted Figure 2, which shows the median post lifetime in minutes versus the number of deletions for each user on a log-log scale. The downward trend indicates that users with higher deletion frequencies experience faster censorship, supporting our hypothesis.

**Figure 2:** Users’ median post lifetime in minutes vs. the number of deletions for that user on a log-log scale. Black circles show the median lifetime of posts in the cohort, and the dotted blue bars show the 25%-75% range.

However, correlation does not imply causation, and other common features among these users, such as using the same keywords or posting from the same geographical area, could also contribute to the fast deletions.

**Hypothesis 3:** When a sensitive post is detected, a moderator will use automated tools to find and delete all related reposts (parent, child, etc.) simultaneously.

To test this, we plotted the histogram of the standard deviation of deletion times for posts sharing the same Repost Identification Number (rpid) in Figure 3. Over 82% of reposted posts have a deletion time standard deviation of less than 5 minutes, suggesting that most related posts are deleted at once.

**Figure 3:** Reposts standard deviation histogram. Outliers with standard deviations as high as 5 days indicate that mass deletion is not the only method used by Weibo.

**Hypothesis 4:** Deletion speed is related to the topic's sensitivity.

We performed topical analysis on deleted posts, using methods described in Section 5.1. Table 3 lists the top topics and their response times. The five main topics extracted by Independent Component Analysis (ICA) are: Qidong, Qian Yunhui, Beijing Rainstorm, Diaoyu Island, and Group Sex. These topics had relatively short lifetimes and were popular in both user and public timelines, suggesting that extra resources are devoted to finding and deleting such posts.

### 5. Topic Extraction

Even with a modest number of Weibo authors, the volume of text is too large for manual processing. We used automatic methods, such as Pointillism [27] and TF*IDF, to extract hot topics. Pointillism reconstructs words and phrases from n-grams using temporal correlations, while TF*IDF assigns weights based on term importance.

**5.1 Algorithm**

TF*IDF is calculated as:
\[ \text{TF*IDF} = f(t, d_{\text{day}}) \times \log \left( \frac{\text{Total number of posts for the month}}{f(t, d_{\text{month}})} \right) \]

Where \( f(t, d) \) is the frequency of term \( t \) in document \( d \). We use trigrams as \( t \), and documents \( d \) are sets of posts over a certain period. The top 1000 trigrams with the highest TF*IDF scores are fed into a trigram connection algorithm (Connector).

**5.2 Hot Sensitive Topics**

The top 50 words appearing most frequently in the 1000-TFIDF list from July 20, 2012, to August 20, 2013, include terms related to government, officials, and sensitive events. Using ICA, we extracted independent signals from these terms, revealing common themes behind the separate topics.
