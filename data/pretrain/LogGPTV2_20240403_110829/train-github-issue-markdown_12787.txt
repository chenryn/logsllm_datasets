Hi,
I am new to electron. I tried to build my own Internet browser with several
tabs using electron. Each tab contains a webview element. I have put src value
to each webview element but I found when I launch the browser only the webview
in active tab was immediately loading. The rest of the webviews were not
loading. It only starts to load if I select the tab belongs to the webview.
I want the webviews to load immediately when the browser launch. How can I do
that?
