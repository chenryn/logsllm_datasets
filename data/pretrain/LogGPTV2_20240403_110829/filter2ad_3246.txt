ABSTRACT
The success of broadband residential Internet access is changing
the way home users consume digital content and services. Cur-
rently, each home service requires the installation of a separate
physical box (for instance, the NetFlix box or IPTV set-top-boxes).
Instead, we argue for deploying a single box in the home that is
powerful and ﬂexible enough to host a variety of home services. In
addition, this box is managed by the Internet Service provider and
is able to provide service guarantees. We call such a box a service-
hosting gateway (SHG), as it combines the functionalities of the
home gateway managed by the network service provider with the
capability of hosting services. Isolation between such services is
ensured by virtualization.
We demonstrate a prototype of our (SHG). It is based on the
hardware platform that will be used for future home gateways. We
illustrate the features of the SHG with multiple use cases ranging
from simple service deployment scenarios to complex media distri-
bution services and home automation features.

INTRODUCTION
Hundreds of millions of homes today connect to the Internet us-
ing broadband access, and the penetration of ﬁber to the home is
growing quickly in developed areas. Such high-speed, always-on
connectivity is changing the way home-users access media ser-
vices and consume content. For instance, many Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) offer “triple-play” services, which bundle Inter-
net, telephony, and TV. The success of over-the-top (OTT) services
(i.e., services that utilize the existing Internet connectivity to deliver
media services outside the ISP service bundle, and that require the
deployment of a speciﬁc box at home) suggests that the demand for
personalized services will increase quickly with bandwidth avail-
ability.
In the current model, the home network is connected to the Inter-
net using a home gateway, which is generally provided by the Net-
work Access Provider (NAP). Services managed by the NAP rely
on the deployment of set-top-boxes (and sometimes IP phones).
All other services are OTT, including online multiplayer gaming
networks, video-on-demand, and home automation to mention just
a few. These services are unmanaged and their quality relies heav-
ily on the available bandwidth provided by the NAP. As the number
of offered services increases, the model of dedicated boxes per ser-
vice is difﬁcult to maintain. as it culminates in a “box explosion”
phenomenon in the home with the consequent complexity to utilize
and manage these boxes.
In this demonstration, we show a prototype of a home gateway
that is able to deploy digital services to the homes in a ﬂexible and
managed way. A single physical box will combine the functions
of a home gateway with the capability of hosting an open portfo-
lio of services. We call this box a service-hosting gateway (SHG).
The SHG will be deployed and managed by the NAP and is able to
provide service guarantees. SHGs give users the ﬂexibility to com-
pose their service portfolio from different service providers with-
out the need for new boxes, while allowing NAPs to make revenue
by guaranteeing a minimum SLA per service delivered. Note that
functionalities that are speciﬁc to a device (e.g., rendering for a TV
or gaming console) are either integrated in the end device or in a
set-top-box per end device.
We implemented the SHG using a classic virtualization tech-
nique as it is the mechanism of choice to provide strong isolation
between the services running simultaneously, i.e., each deployed
service is running in its own host OS. Virtualization introduces
some performance overhead [6, 1, 7], but it also provides isola-
tion and a ﬂexible environment for service developers. There are
a number of virtualization techniques to choose from, with differ-
ent performance overhead and different levels of ﬂexibility. We
have installed and tested different virtualization solutions includ-
ing Xen [8], Linux Containers [4], and KVM ˘g[2]. Based on the
requirements for this demo and the overhead induced by each of
the mentioned solutions, we decided to base the prototype on the
Linux Containers (LXC) solution.
We demonstrate the SHG concept with two physical gateways
combined with multiple emulated gateways running on a server.
This distributed infrastructure will be used to showcase how new
services can be deployed on an ISP infrastructure, how the new
services are monitored on the gateways. The SHGs are then used
to illustrate this distributed infrastructure is able to host and run
services in a combined manner. We show how his distributed data-
center infrastructure is able to distribute media content using peer-
to-peer technology and with that to save investments on the cen-
tralized datacenter infrastructure used today (see also [5] for more
details).

2. SHG HARDWARE DESCRIPTION
The SHG used in this demo is based on an Intel SoC platform
476With these set of applications, we illustrate how a low power
and always on home gateway is able to host and run multiple ap-
plications simultaneously. The hardware used for our prototype is
realistic as this is the platform will be used by NSPs for their fu-
ture home gateways or set top boxes. We show how virtualization
is able to isolate the services and how access can be controlled and
how dedicated resources can be guaranteed to the service provider.
The management framework illustrates how such a distributed plat-
form is used and how the services and applications are deployed
and monitored.
4. CONCLUSION
The success of the service hosting platform deployed in home
networks will result from a complex mixture of ingredients. The
service running on the SHG needs to be able to guarantee a similar
Quality of Experience for the end user to the QoE provided by a
dedicated device running the same service. At the same time, the
NSP has to maintain the cost for the SHG as low as possible to
increase the margins for each deployed gateway. These conﬂicting
results require a careful selection of the underlying hardware for
the SHG.
We have selected a platform that is foreseen to be used for future
home gateway products. This Intel_SoC platform offers an interest-
ing tradeoff between cost and performance providing enough per-
formance for standard applications and services. In the prototype
implementation used for this demo, we are able to showcase multi-
ple applications and service running simultaneously on the system.
Even when all services are used at then same time, none is encoun-
tering service interruptions or degradation.
Key for success however will be the management of the platform.
We will demonstrate a simple management tool used by the NSP to
deploy and monitor services on the SHGs. On top, we demonstrate
how service providers are able to develop their applications and
services for the proposed platform and how service monitoring is
implemented. Finally, the demo illustrated how the end user can
run multiple service without the need of deploying and conﬁguring
multiple devices.

Figure 1: Service Hosting Gateway running three services:
gaming, social networking and streaming
CE4200. The CE4200 has an 1.2GHz dual core processor inte-
grated, together with an additional CPU for transcoding (not used
for this demo). The system has 1GByte of RAM and no onboard
hard disk, but we added USB-attached storage. The boards also
provide two 1GBit/s Ethernet interfaces. We run a modiﬁed Linux
(provided together with the Intel development kit) on this platform
and managed to installed Linux Containers [4].
The gateways and the server are connected via a switch; to em-
ulate realistic bandwidth for the connection between the gateways
and the server, we added a dummynet module and limit the band-
width to typical DSL settings and also delay and jitter.
3. SHG DEMONSTRATION
We will demonstrate how the three players (the NSP, the hosting
service provider, and the end user) interact. A new SHG only runs
classic triple play: voice, Internet, IPTV). Then, we let the NSP
deploy new services to all or a subset of all devices. Aside, the
NSP will be able to monitor where and how the service is used.
Finally, the user will select the applications he subscribes to and
runs them on its local SHG.
We show the deployment and use of the platform with the fol-
lowing examples:
• Gaming A network gaming service provider is deploying a
distributed game platform. Each gateway is gunning a part of
the gaming service, i.e., hosting a portion of the map played
by the end users. We will showcase such a game using a
distributed but simple PacMan implementation.
• Home Automation The energy provider is renting a slice of
the distributed hosting platform and is deploying a software
suite to monitor and control the devices connected to the
home automation system.
• Peer-assisted Video on Demand Distribution We demonstrate
how a video streaming provider is able to use the SHGs to
deliver video content from a centralized streaming source
(CDN) but also from the distributed storage system provided
by the SHGs. The service implemented is building on a mod-
iﬁed BitTorrent implementation that downloads the media
chunks from the closest gateways instead of the data centers
(see [3] and [5] for details).
• Remote Surveillance The SHG is ﬁnally used to host a net-
work surveillance service. For this service, the gateway hosts
a solution that captures images form a video camera and
makes the images available on the TV screen of the end user.
The same video information can also sent over the Internet
and the stream can be retrieved remotely through a web page
also hosted on the SHG.
