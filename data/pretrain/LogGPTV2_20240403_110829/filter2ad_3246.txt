## Abstract
The widespread adoption of broadband residential Internet access is transforming how home users consume digital content and services. Currently, each home service requires a separate physical device (e.g., a Netflix box or an IPTV set-top-box). We propose deploying a single, powerful, and flexible device in the home that can host a variety of services. This device, managed by the Internet Service Provider (ISP), ensures service guarantees and is called a Service-Hosting Gateway (SHG). The SHG combines the functionalities of a home gateway with the capability to host multiple services, ensuring isolation through virtualization.

We present a prototype of the SHG, based on a hardware platform intended for future home gateways. We demonstrate its features through various use cases, from simple service deployment to complex media distribution and home automation.

## 1. Introduction
Hundreds of millions of homes today connect to the Internet using broadband, and fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) penetration is rapidly increasing in developed areas. High-speed, always-on connectivity is changing how home users access media services and consume content. Many ISPs offer "triple-play" services, bundling Internet, telephony, and TV. The success of over-the-top (OTT) services, which deliver media outside the ISP bundle and require a dedicated box, suggests a growing demand for personalized services as bandwidth increases.

Currently, the home network is connected to the Internet via a home gateway provided by the Network Access Provider (NAP). NAP-managed services often require set-top boxes, while other services, such as online gaming, video-on-demand, and home automation, are unmanaged and rely on available bandwidth. As the number of services grows, the model of dedicated boxes per service becomes unsustainable, leading to a "box explosion" in homes, complicating their use and management.

In this demonstration, we showcase a prototype of a home gateway that can flexibly and manageably deploy digital services. This single physical box, the Service-Hosting Gateway (SHG), combines the functions of a home gateway with the capability to host an open portfolio of services. Managed by the NAP, the SHG provides service guarantees, allowing users to compose their service portfolio from different providers without additional boxes and enabling NAPs to generate revenue by ensuring a minimum Service Level Agreement (SLA) per service. Device-specific functionalities (e.g., rendering for a TV or gaming console) are integrated into the end device or a set-top box per end device.

We implemented the SHG using classic virtualization techniques to provide strong isolation between simultaneously running services. Each deployed service runs in its own host OS. Virtualization introduces some performance overhead but also provides a flexible environment for service developers. We tested various virtualization solutions, including Xen, Linux Containers (LXC), and KVM, and chose LXC for our prototype due to its low overhead and flexibility.

We demonstrate the SHG concept using two physical gateways and multiple emulated gateways running on a server. This distributed infrastructure showcases how new services can be deployed and monitored on an ISP infrastructure, illustrating the SHG's ability to host and run services in a combined manner. We also show how this distributed data-center infrastructure can distribute media content using peer-to-peer technology, reducing investments in centralized datacenter infrastructure.

## 2. SHG Hardware Description
The SHG used in this demo is based on the Intel SoC platform CE4200, featuring a 1.2GHz dual-core processor, an additional CPU for transcoding (not used in this demo), 1GB of RAM, and USB-attached storage. The platform includes two 1Gbit/s Ethernet interfaces. We run a modified Linux (provided with the Intel development kit) and have installed Linux Containers (LXC).

To emulate realistic bandwidth, we use a dummynet module to limit the connection between the gateways and the server to typical DSL settings, including delay and jitter.

## 3. SHG Demonstration
We will demonstrate the interaction between the NAP, the hosting service provider, and the end user. Initially, the SHG runs standard triple-play services (voice, Internet, IPTV). The NAP can then deploy new services to all or a subset of devices and monitor their usage. The user can select and run subscribed applications on their local SHG.

### Examples:
- **Gaming**: A network gaming service provider deploys a distributed game platform. Each SHG hosts a portion of the game map, demonstrated using a distributed PacMan implementation.
- **Home Automation**: An energy provider rents a slice of the distributed hosting platform to deploy software for monitoring and controlling home automation devices.
- **Peer-assisted Video on Demand Distribution**: A video streaming provider uses SHGs to deliver content from a centralized source (CDN) and a distributed storage system. The service is built on a modified BitTorrent implementation that downloads media chunks from the closest gateways.
- **Remote Surveillance**: The SHG hosts a network surveillance service, capturing images from a video camera and making them available on the user's TV screen. The video stream can also be accessed remotely via a web page hosted on the SHG.

## 4. Conclusion
The success of the SHG in home networks depends on a balance of factors. The SHG must provide a similar Quality of Experience (QoE) to a dedicated device while keeping costs low for the NAP. We selected the Intel SoC platform for its cost-performance tradeoff, demonstrating multiple applications and services running simultaneously without service interruptions or degradation.

Key to success is the management of the platform. We will demonstrate a simple management tool for NAPs to deploy and monitor services on SHGs, and how service providers can develop and monitor their applications. Finally, the demo illustrates how end users can run multiple services without deploying and configuring multiple devices.
