# Environment
    Windows build number: Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19008.1000]
    Windows Terminal version : 0.6.2951
    Lenovo Thinkpad P1 :
        Intel Xeon E-2176M
        Hybrid Graphics with Intel P630 and Nvidia Quadro P2000
        64GB RAM
    Any other software?
# Steps to reproduce
Very easy to reproduce. Have the performance monitor open and bring terminal
to foreground. The GPU usage spikes.  
I noticed this issue because, mouse becomes laggy and UI is almost unusable.
I am pasting two screen shots when the terminal goes foreground and when the
terminal goes background
## High GPU usage when the terminal is foreground

## Low GPU usage when the terminal goes background

# Expected behavior
A relatively idle terminal should not be consuming 100% GPU and there by
freezing the UI
# Actual behavior
UI lockups due to 100% GPU
