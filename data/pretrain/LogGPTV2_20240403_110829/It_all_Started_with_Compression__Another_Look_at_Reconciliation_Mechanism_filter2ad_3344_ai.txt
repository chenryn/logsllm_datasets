dire needs of the amputees and other war affected persons especially those in the 
vast rural areas. 
Perhaps more crucial is the perceived inability of the state to effectively address 
the plight of war victims with special needs, and the socialization processes of chil-
dren and other members of the extended families of victims. The pent up anger of 
the victims and the danger that poses to long-term reconciliation came out clearly 
during the testimonies of victims, during the proceedings of the Commission.
We the amputees, how are we in this world now? I am not speaking for myself here. The 
government should not leave our case behind. It is not for us, it is for our children. If my 
child grows up and asks me who chopped off my hand, I will say these people did it to 
me. That will bring the war again. If you say peace should come, we the amputees should 
bring the peace. I can’t be struggling and say that I am living in peace. That is why our 
case should be pushed forward. If our problem is left behind, [the] war will not end. We 
the amputees we all have children… we have no hands. We should be assisted. If we are 
assisted we will have peace of mind. All our children can think for themselves now. They 
ask us who chopped off our hands and feet. We have to make our children reconcile their 
minds. (Adama Koroma, a female victim, testimony to the Commission and answering 
the Chairman’s questions.)
Asked by the TRC Chairman what his recommendations to the Commission would 
be, a male victim replied thus:
The first thing I want to recommend is that most of us are willing to forgive, but to sustain 
this forgiveness, you can all see that we have lost our dignity because we used to be fit to 
fend for ourselves but this is not so anymore. That has caused most of us to become beggars 
in the streets…So I will recommend to the Commission that they should put mechanisms 
in place, which will ensure that there are provisions for us, which will be sustainable and 
not something that we can eat in a single day, something that will be sustainable maybe 
for as long we are alive and even our children…

Finally, the report was categorical on the precarious nature of the post hostilities 
peace building and reconstruction efforts if victims are not well catered for.
Some are faced almost continuously with those who have harmed them in their own 
communities, their presence serving as a constant reminder of the violation suffered. 
Moving beyond this state is impossible given the economic and social conditions 
that victims find themselves in and their dependence on handouts. The humiliation 
of being dependent on the charity of others and often having to beg in order to live 
re-victimizes victims, leaving lasting scars and wounds that may fester thoughts of 
bitterness and anger. This may constitute the seeds of future violence. A reparations 
programme has the potential to restore the dignity of victims whose lives have been 
most devastated to move beyond the position they are in as a consequence of the war. 
The restoration of the dignity of victims can help to create the conditions necessary 
for reconciliation.
Sound as the above arguments are, the truth is that government is incapable of do-
ing much for the victims. According to a keen observer of the political scene in the 
country, there are clear signs that the government of Tejan Kabbah is doing little to 
address the underlying factors that led to the war in the first place (interview in Ham-
burg). This misgiving is further buttressed by a recent study on post war regimes and 
reconstruction in Liberia and Sierra Leone:  
…some of the expectations of Sierra Leoneans regarding President Kabbah’s ability 
to propel the country’s post conflict peace building project were dashed. On assum-
ing the mantle of leadership, for example, he appointed a 22-member cabinet drawn 
mainly from his SLPP party faithful and supporters. Although this action is not 
in conflict with the country’s constitution, it is not a true reflection of the spirit of 
reconciliation in a post war society (Gbla forthcoming).
Another keen observer lamented:
The tragedy of Sierra Leone is catasrophic failure of leadership, compounded by Kab-
bah’s government, which is increasingly out of step with the pulse of the nation.1
It would appear, then, that government is doing business as usual. But the danger of 
this déjà vu attitude was brought home rather dramatically in early May 2004 when 
some 200 amputees mounted a violent protested in the southeastern town of Ken-
ema, to bring their desperate plight to the attention of the government. According 
to their spokesperson, three amputees had died the week before the protest due to 
medical neglect. Much more illuminating was their complaint that the post conflict 
reconciliation policies of government favoured and even valorised ex-combatants; 
they are “sent to school, given scholarships to study at home and abroad without 
caring about the victims”.2 Another amputee lamented: “What puzzles me is that

the perpetrators are cared for and those of us who are victims are left out. What will 
happen to us in the future?”1 These expressions of frustration draw attention to two 
interrelated developments in post war Sierra Leone: the apparent preference given to 
ex-combatants and even perpetrators, evident in some government programmes, on 
the one hand, and on the other, the apparent inability of the state to mount credible 
and autonomous post war reconciliation programmes. The hard fact is that govern-
ment does not own the whole of post conflict reconciliation processes and agenda, 
as long as they are externally driven. Unfortunately, the concerns and priorities and 
even the focus of the donor community, including many Non-Governmental Or-
ganizations, are not necessarily the same as those of the state and people of Sierra 
Leone. For instance, the amputees’ colony has been disbanded without compensa-
tion or the necessary social and economic infrastructure in place to cater for their 
needs. Thus, while they were literally emptied into communities without any means 
of livelihood that would also guarantee their dignity, the perpetrators were given a 
package of support worth about Le300,000 during the disarmament, demobiliza-
tion and reintegration exercise. Much preferred by the donor community as a stabi-
lizing force, in the eyes of the victims, DDR seems like rewarding the perpetrators 
of violence, and has created a yawning gap between the victims and government on 
the one hand, and between victims and perpetrators on the other. Certainly, such a 
situation is far from ideal for long-term peace and reconciliation, contrary to what 
the popular arguments would have us believe. 
In that regard, although in some respects the Truth Commission was patterned 
after that in South Africa, there are significant differences between them. The ini-
tiative in South Africa was largely conceived and driven from within. Also, South 
Africa has the resource capacity at its disposal, thereby making itself much more 
autonomous of external influence. Thus, it is arguable that the activities and rec-
ommendations of its TRC, in spite of their severe limitations, were within reach of 
government, given the political will. However, in the case of Sierra Leone, there was 
too much reliance on the international community, which typically made financial 
pledges but frequently fell short in redeeming them. Consequently, the much an-
nounced rehabilitation programme especially for amputees, victims of sexual vio-
lence, children etc. could not be implemented as planned. For instance, a critical 
issue is caring for HIV/AIDS victims in the absence of facilities and expertise in 
the country. According to the Final Report of the TRC, for example, there are only 
300 medical doctors in the whole country, and half that number reside in the capi-
tal, Freetown.2 The implication is that since many of the victims of sexual violence 
reside in the countryside, they would not have access to even those limited facilities

that are in place. This, perhaps, was why the Truth Commission recommended set-
ting up four regional centres but hat is hardly enough to cater for the needs of all 
victims, especially in the light of crushing poverty and poor transport infrastruc-
ture. In short, most victims would not be able to access treatment in the proposed 
regional centres if they are finally created given the distances, even if treatment were 
to be free. 
That, to me, is perhaps the crux of the matter. Sierra Leone cannot embark 
upon the imperative transition from insecurity to genuine peace and development 
in a fragile political and economic situation without a massive injection of material 
and financial assistance from the international community. But that cannot be as-
sured anymore because the donor community has its tolerance limit, and the present 
“good  will”  cannot  continue  indefinitely.  Indeed,  there  is  now  a  lively  debate  in 
donor countries on what to do with basket cases like Sierra Leone, and some have 
even suggested a return to the “protectorate system” of old.1 As a result, the pace, the 
content, the extent and even the quality of the peace and security and development 
programmes in the country will depend very much on how far the international 
community is still ready to go. What is clear so far is that there is an evident scaling 
down of donor activity in the country. 
The  problem  is  that  while  it  is  logical  to  argue  that  the  TRC  provides  “re-
storative” justice which is the foundation of healing and reconciliation, it would not 
make much sense if the victims are left on their own and to fend for themselves. 
For instance, how would a youth whose limbs have been amputated secure his/her 
daily needs with dignity in a country where the majority of able bodied citizens live 
below the poverty line? Sierra Leone, after all, was among the poorest countries in 
the world, long before the war. Certainly, the fratricidal war had exacerbated the 
situation for the majority, but more especially so for the amputees and others with 
special circumstances. The important question, then, is: Will the affected youths 
and adults ever forget the past and move on, when the past is deeply etched on their 
individual and collective daily experiences? The answer is certainly no, and that has 
significant bearing on long-term peace and understanding in the country.
Furthermore, the truth of the matter is that if the family – both the immedi-
ate and extended members – on whom most Sierra Leoneans depend in times of 
need, is unable to provide physical, emotional and material buffering to victims, it 
is doubtful if the community could fill such an important gap. Moreover, in such a 
situation, it would be very difficult for homes and communities that have amputees 
and other victims of the war with special requirements, to forgive perpetrators, espe-
cially if they – the perpetrators – also live in their midst. The point is that as long as 
1. The donor community is now seriously discussing the possibility of introducing once again the 
trusteeship system for failed states especially in Africa. Obvious candidates for this new system 
are countries like Sierra Leone and Liberia in West Africa. This was the theme of an international 
conference, Trusteeship: A Question for the 21st Century, that I had the privilege of attending in Bel-
lagio, Italy, in February 2006.

victims nurse disaffection towards government and perpetrators, they will continue 
to transmit negative socialization behavioural traits to their children and members 
of their extended families and communities. The hatred and frustration will linger 
for a long time in such families and even after the death of the original victim. 
According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the 
“reminders” of the war are still very much evident to the visitor as soon as he arrives 
in the capital, Freetown.
At  Mammy  Yoko  helipad,  where  helicopters  from  the  international  airport  drop 
off passengers coming to Freetown, young Joseph Fofanah – perhaps 13 years old 
– walks up to one of the cars taking the visitors to their various destinations. With-
out a word, he holds up the remnants of his arms – amputated above the elbows by 
combatants during the war – and begs for help. Other amputees do likewise. “I don’t 
know what the TRC or the Special Court is. I have nothing to say about him (the 
person who cut off his arms) but just help me with something to eat”1. 
Several other crucial questions will have to be answered either now or at some point 
in the future if the reconciliation exercise is to have lasting impact not only on all 
those affected by the war, but the rest of society. For instance, how do you reconcile 
babies who were amputated with their perpetrators? Is such reconciliation going to 
be by proxy, that is, between the parents of amputees and the perpetrators? Would 
such babies receive compensation from the state at any time in the future in the form 
of educational subsidies or scholarships? But even if compensation were to be paid, 
will it go directly to the parents? It would seem to me that the ideal situation would 
be to set up a Reparations Fund for such children/victims while they are yet to reach 
the statutory age of  majority of 18 years. But is that possible at the moment? It is 
very doubtful. My submission is that for reconciliation to take deep roots, adult vic-
tims and families of those yet to reach maturity would have to be economically em-
powered to minimize the risk of “rejection”. That however leaves the whole question 
of how to heal the emotional wounds of young victims of the uncivil war, babies, 
toddlers, etc. especially the trauma and related psychological problems, wide open. I 
am not sure if government has an effective answer to their predicament. 
A  study  conducted  in  2001/2002  on  trauma  among  child  soldiers  in  Sierra 
Leone and Liberia found that the “most visible symptoms of the phenomenon are; 
anxiety,  depression,  hyperactivity,  aggressive  behaviour,  withdrawal,  bed-wetting 
and recurrent nightmares” (Gbla 2003:180). The author lamented however, that 
much of what has been done for the child soldiers so far, has been in the areas of 
meeting their material and physical needs (Gbla 2003:183) The irony here is that 
while the youth were easily recruited into the war because of their dire state before 
the war, the post war programmes have not adequately addressed their predicaments 
either. In other words, like in pre-war Sierra Leone, the youth are yet to be given a

“voice” in the scheme of things after the war. For sure, there is now a Ministry for 
Youth and Sports but there were no consultations between the government and the 
youth before it was set up, to find out what the priority areas in youth rehabilitation 
programmes should be. Yes, skills training schemes were made available, carpentry, 
tailoring, etc. but are they the preferred areas for youth empowerment? 
It is common knowledge that most of the youth live in the rural areas and are 
mainly engaged in subsistence farming, and are also in urgent need of assistance. 
Thus, a more realistic and even “natural” response would have been food produc-
tion, and a “back to the farm” scheme to placate the idle rural youth.  But again 
we are confronted with the stark reality of local capacity which is just not there to 
handle such a programme. For the teeming youth, then, there is once again a sense 
of déjà vu, for the more things seem to change, the more they remain the same. 
It is safe to conclude therefore, that by and large popular expectations from 
the TRC have not been met. For instance, although the Commission was to come 
up with a blueprint on how war could be avoided in future, many of its recommen-
dations are hinged more or less on government good will, which cannot be taken 
for granted even at the best of times. For instance, although bad governance and 
especially policies of exclusion were singled out as the most important background 
factors that incubated the resentment which eventually triggered the war, there are 
no perceptible safeguards in place on how another war can be avoided in future. It 
would seem government is infected with the same old virus: corruption, marginali-
zation, tribalism etc. Sadly, the virus seems to be resistant to all the remedies so far 
prescribed both by local and foreign stakeholders. Yes, there are halting attempts to 
decentralize governance in theory but, in practice, almost everything is still central-
ized around the President and the ruling party; access to economic and political 
resources and other benefits is still dependent upon how close an individual is to 
political power. Social services and related infrastructure are still concentrated in 
Freetown. Again, most of those who benefit from such services are the elites, includ-
ing the Lebanese and Indians. It is therefore imperative for government to broaden 
its base so that other stakeholders are brought in, for that is the surest way of pre-
venting a relapse into the old ways of doing things with all their attendant negative 
consequences. As a perceptive observer noted
My submission is that the “primary cancer” in our case may be and was and will 
always be grave social injustice and the desperate desire to deprive the less fortu-
nate in society…whilst the “secondary infection” is the …savage conflict which has 
eroded and deprived victims” knowledge of good and evil. Learning to uphold and 
administer justice fairly and fearlessly is the major therapy to that trauma (Momoh 
2002:25).
The stark reality of Sierra Leone’s predicament is: how do you ensure good govern-
ance through “distributive justice” in an environment of extreme economic depriva-

tion? Unfortunately, this problem has been compounded by the fact that external 
engagements in post war or post conflict reconciliation and reconstruction projects 
in many parts of the world are not only transient, but are at one level, also elabo-
rate exit strategies for the guarantors of peace agreements. From such a view point, 
then, once the most pressing aspects of the post conflict reconstruction project have 
been accomplished or are seen to have been realized, the international community 
is bound to withdraw and with that, there is no effective external superintending 
agency to monitor what goes on in the country. This is particularly so since even the 
recommendations of the TRC are of a long-term nature. From then on, the shape 
of the reconciliation and reconstruction activities and programmes would more or 
less depend on the local regime’s understanding of what should be done, and more 
importantly,  on  availability  of  local  capacity  to  do  it.  The  inevitable  conclusion, 
therefore, is that while true reconciliation is best promoted through inclusive demo-
cratic governance – a government that is not only responsible to, but also alive to 
the yearnings of the people – there is no guarantee that government will rise to the 
occasion and help its citizens break the yoke of extreme deprivation and squalor.  
However, unless the material, mental and physical needs of the people, especially 
the  disabled  are  adequately  catered  for  in  post  conflict  reconciliation  and  recon-
struction processes and programmes, it will be difficult for them to forget their past 
and look to a brighter future. As a diplomat in Freetown commented in respect of 
the TRC proceedings:
Yes the stories will be told, but people will go back to live with amputees in the same com-
munity. How do you guarantee that revenge will not occur?  
To avert such a doomsday scenario and consolidate the reconciliation processes so 
that both victims and perpetrators are fully rehabilitated and integrated into the 
larger society where they will not feel ostracized or marginalized, seems to me to 
be the biggest test facing not only the government of President Tejan Kabbah, but 
also those who are likely to succeed him in the near future. Will he or the successor 
regime measure up to it? Only time will tell.
