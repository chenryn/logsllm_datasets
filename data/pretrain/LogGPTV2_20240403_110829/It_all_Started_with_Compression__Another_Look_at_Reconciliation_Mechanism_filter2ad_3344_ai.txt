### Addressing the Needs of War-Affected Persons in Sierra Leone

The urgent needs of amputees and other war-affected individuals, particularly those in rural areas, are a critical concern. More crucial is the perceived inability of the state to effectively address the plight of these victims, especially those with special needs, and the socialization processes of children and extended family members. The pent-up anger of victims, which poses a significant threat to long-term reconciliation, was evident in their testimonies before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC).

**Testimony from Adama Koroma:**

"Us amputees, how are we living in this world now? I am not speaking for myself alone. The government should not neglect our case. This is not just for us; it is for our children. If my child grows up and asks me who cut off my hand, I will say, 'These people did it to me.' That could reignite the conflict. If we want peace, we, the amputees, must be part of it. I cannot struggle and claim to live in peace. Our case must be prioritized. If our problems are ignored, the war will not truly end. We, the amputees, all have children... and no hands. We need assistance. If we receive help, we will find peace of mind. Our children can think for themselves now. They ask us who cut off our hands and feet. We must help our children reconcile their minds."

**Recommendations from a Male Victim:**

"The first thing I recommend is that most of us are willing to forgive, but to sustain this forgiveness, you can see that we have lost our dignity. We used to be able to provide for ourselves, but now we cannot. This has forced many of us to become beggars on the streets. Therefore, I recommend that the Commission put in place mechanisms to ensure sustainable provisions for us, something that will last as long as we are alive and even benefit our children."

### Final Report of the TRC

The TRC's final report emphasized the precarious nature of post-conflict peacebuilding and reconstruction if victims are not adequately supported. Many victims face constant reminders of their trauma in their communities, making it impossible to move beyond their suffering given their economic and social conditions. The humiliation of dependence on charity and begging re-victimizes them, leaving lasting scars and fostering bitterness and anger, which could fuel future violence. A reparations program could restore the dignity of victims, creating conditions necessary for reconciliation.

### Government Inaction and External Influence

Despite the compelling arguments for reparations, the government appears incapable of addressing the needs of victims. Observers note that the government of Tejan Kabbah is doing little to address the underlying factors that led to the war. For instance, Kabbah's cabinet appointments were primarily from his party, reflecting a lack of commitment to reconciliation. This misgiving is further supported by a study on post-war regimes in Liberia and Sierra Leone, which highlights the government's failure to meet the expectations of its citizens.

In May 2004, about 200 amputees staged a violent protest in Kenema, drawing attention to their desperate situation. According to their spokesperson, three amputees had died due to medical neglect. They complained that post-conflict policies favored ex-combatants, who received educational opportunities and support, while victims were left behind. This disparity exacerbates the gap between victims and the government, and between victims and perpetrators, hindering long-term peace and reconciliation.

### International Community and Donor Fatigue

While the TRC in Sierra Leone was modeled after South Africa's, there are significant differences. South Africa's initiative was largely driven internally, and the country had the resources to implement the TRC's recommendations. In contrast, Sierra Leone heavily relied on the international community, which often fell short of its financial pledges. Consequently, rehabilitation programs for amputees, victims of sexual violence, and children could not be fully implemented. The lack of medical facilities and expertise, especially in rural areas, further complicates the situation.

### Long-Term Peace and Development

Sierra Leone cannot transition from insecurity to genuine peace and development without substantial material and financial assistance from the international community. However, donor fatigue and the limits of international aid pose significant challenges. There is a debate in donor countries about how to handle "basket cases" like Sierra Leone, with some suggesting a return to the "protectorate system." The pace and quality of peace and development programs in Sierra Leone will depend on the continued support of the international community.

### Reconciliation and Empowerment

For reconciliation to take root, adult victims and families of young victims must be economically empowered. This would minimize the risk of rejection and help heal emotional wounds. However, the government's current efforts fall short, particularly in addressing the psychological needs of young victims. A study on trauma among child soldiers in Sierra Leone and Liberia found that the most visible symptoms include anxiety, depression, hyperactivity, and aggressive behavior. While post-war programs have met some material needs, they have not adequately addressed the broader issues facing youth, such as their participation in decision-making and their preferred areas for empowerment.

### Conclusion

Popular expectations from the TRC have not been met, and the government's response to the commission's recommendations remains inadequate. Corruption, marginalization, and tribalism persist, and there are no safeguards to prevent another conflict. Social services and infrastructure are concentrated in Freetown, benefiting mainly the elites. Broadening the government's base and ensuring inclusive democratic governance are essential for preventing a relapse into old patterns. Ensuring the material, mental, and physical needs of the people, especially the disabled, are met is crucial for true reconciliation and a brighter future.
