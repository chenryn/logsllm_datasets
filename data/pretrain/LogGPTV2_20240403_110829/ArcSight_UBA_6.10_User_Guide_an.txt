Resource Behavior ProfilesBehavior profiling analyzes what users do on a company network by collecting all user privileges, resources, and activities, establishing a baseline of normal behavior, and then identifying the abnor-mal or outlier behaviors to bring to the attention of security administrators. Behavior profiles are gen-erated based on attributes in the datasource, which are specified during policy creation and selected based on the requirements for the policy.For example, for the policy Rare Service Creation, if one service account is created on Windows per day, ArcSight UBA establishes a baseline of one, daily for the resource. If two service accounts are created on Windows in one day, ArcSight UBA detects the rare behavior as an outlier, and a viol-ation is generated.

Watch ListA watch list is a means to place entities on a close watch based on inherent risks. This feature helps to monitor a user, account, host, etc. that is deemed problematic and requires special attention. For example, a user who has an upcoming termination event can be put on a watch list to closely mon-itor the activities that the user performs. Security analysts are notified if the user performs certain actions such as data exfiltration or inappropriate data access. Another example could be a malware infected account that is put on a watch list to closely monitor its activities and detect further activ-ities. For information about how to create a watch list, see Watch Lists in the ArcSight UBA Admin-istration Guide.From the Watch List screen, you can view watch lists, manage members in a watch list, and delete watch lists. To access Watch Lists, navigate to Menu > Views > Watch Lists.
Select a watch list from the left navigation panel. You can type text to filter the list or click the Advanced Options menu to search for a specific watch list. Click the delete icon to delete a watch list.ArcSight User Behavior Analytics 6.10User Guide 	Page 303 of318

Lookup TablesViews
Lookup Tables
A Lookup Table is similar to an Excel table. The Lookup Table functions like an index for faster pro-cessing, wherein the lookup function is used to find a one-row or one-column range (known as a vec-tor) for a value. The function then returns a value from the same position in a second one-row or one-column range.For example, an Excel spreadsheet contains Resources to Business unit mappings required to pop-ulate the business unit name against the resources table in the application. You can use a pre-pro-cessor or a stored procedure to reference this spreadsheet to obtain the corresponding values for each resource name, and then populate the resource table with the business unit name for each resource. The application provides the Lookup Tables as extra tables that can be used according to individual user needs.For more detailed information and to import lookup data, see Lookup Tables in the Administration Guide.
To view data in Lookup Tables, navigate to Menu > Views > Lookup Tables.
The left navigation panel displays the imported Lookup Tables. Type text to filter the list. You can also click the delete icon to delete a Lookup Table.
