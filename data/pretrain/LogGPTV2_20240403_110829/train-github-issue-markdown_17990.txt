I recently purchased new Mac Pro w/ Mac Os X 11.0.1 & Apple Silicon M1.
I installed homebrew (when enabling Rosetta) and managed to install python3.9
and other packages through brew (numpy==1.19.5 & scipy==1.6.0, amongst
others).
However, executing my one-liner script yields a "bus error". That happens when
I try to import curve_fit from scipy.optimize. Any ideas how to solve that?
I believe this is hardware related and is due to non optimal compilation of
scipy for the M1 architecture (data are lost somewhere on the memory bus?
https://www.quora.com/Why-there-is-a-bus-error-in-the-Python-program-when-it-
recurs-over-18-713-times ).
Python code:
    from scipy.optimize import curve_fit
Error:
    zsh: bus error
Tail lines when running this code in python3.9 with -v option.
