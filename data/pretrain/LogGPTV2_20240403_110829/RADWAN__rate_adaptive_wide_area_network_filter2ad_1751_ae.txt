the observation made in Section 5. We investigate the cause
of latency in capacity reconfiguration and find that majority
of this time is associated with turning the laser back on after
reprogramming the transceiver module. We plot
the
distribution of time taken to change modulations without
turning off the laser and find that it only takes approximately
35 ms on average. This suggests an opportunity to strive
towards hitless capacity changes in the fiber.
7.2 Cost and Distance
One of the key benefits of deploying bandwidth variable links
is their cost savings. While we are sadly unable to report the
exact discounted retail price that we have been quoted, our

with the cost of 100 Gbps static transceiver. This comparable
cost is in fact one of the motivating factors for operators to
start deploying BVTs even if they are being programmed a
few times in their life time.
A disadvantage of using higher order modulations is that
they limit the distance that the light can travel. As mentioned
in §1 current QPSK modulation format supports data rates
of 100 Gbps for distances upto 3,000 km, 8QAM allows
150 Gbps for distances up to 2,100 km, and 16QAM allows
200 Gbps for distances up to 800 km. We analyzed the fiber
distances in our WAN and found that 50% of our fiber paths
are less than 800 km (thus capable of supporting 16-QAM),
the remaining 45% are between 800 to 2,100 km (thus capable
of supporting 8-QAM), and only 5% of paths are longer than
2,100 km. While in our analysis, we did not take the distances
into account, we believe it will not dramatically impact our
results. Moreover, device manufacturers are working towards
improving the distances for higher order modulation.
8 RELATED WORK
Our work builds on several lines of related research as cate-
gorized below.
Optical and IP layer orchestration. Singh et al. [24] re-
cently analyzed the SNR of links in a large North American
backbone over a period of 2.5 years and proposed adapting
link capacities to the SNR optical channels. We extend their
study period to 3 years, also broadening their initial
measurement and testbed quantifications. We also propose a
centralized TE controller system RADWAN and evaluate the
interaction between dynamic capacity links and IP layer
flows with simulations at scale and in a realistic testbed. The
study by Jin et al. [18] on cross-layer optimization between
IP and optical layers wavelengths is similar in spirit to our
motivation of bridging the gap between optical and IP layers.
In their work, Jin et al. show reconfiguration of wavelengths
provides latency gains for deadline driven bulk transfers, also
providing a competitive analysis of scheduling single-hop
transfers in [17]. But their work still keeps the capacity of
each wavelength static. In contrast, our work focuses on the
reconfiguration of the capacity of wavelengths, without the
migration of wavelengths across links. We also provide
measurements from an operational backbone and argue for
changing link capacities with a focus on throughput and
reliability. An interesting future direction is to study the
throughput and latency gains of the combination of the two
proposals: a fully programmable WAN topology were both
capacities and placement of wavelengths on fiber is informed
by the centralized TE.
data
from Microsoft’s
WAN measurements. Govindan et al. [13] study 100
failure events across two WANs and data center networks,
offering insights into the challenges of maintaining high
levels of availability for content providers. Although they do
not isolate optical layer failures, they report on root causes of
failures, including optical transmitters. We complement their
work by focusing on optical layer failures. Ghobadi et al.
study Q-factor
optical
backbone [11, 12] and provide insights on the data. Our work
complements their analysis on several fronts. First, we take a
deep dive into the impact of temporal changes of SNR on
link capacities in terms of capacity gain, availability gains,
and realistic throughput gains. Second, we propose and build
the system infrastructure required to achieve capacity vari-
able links and benchmark the throughput gains using realistic
IP level data. Third, we build a comprehensive testbed and
evaluate the impact of capacity reconfiguration, as well as
amplifiers on the path. Our work closes the loop for enabling
capacity variable links. Similarly, Filer et al. [7] studied the
deployed optical infrastructure of Microsoft’s backbone; they
discuss the benefits of optical elasticity, express a long-term
goal of unifying the optical control plane with routers under
a single Software Defined Network controller and recognize
YANG [4] and SNMP as potential starting points for a
standard data model and control interface between the optical
layer and the WAN traffic controller. In this work, we explore
how programmability in the optical layer can bring through-
put gains and present a cross-layer WAN traffic controller for
dynamic capacity links. Marian et al. [22] focused on IP and
TCP layer measurements such as packet loss and packet
inter-arrival times on fiber optics spans. In contrast, we
capture failures in the optical layer using failure tickets.
Hardware feasibility studies. Yoshida et al. [28, 29]
studied the use of 12.5 GHz spectrum slices for allocating
bandwidth variable connections to improve the spectrum
usage. Although their works did not consider real-time
adjustment of the capacity, they provided the foundation for
the feasibility of building the necessary hardware with
variable bandwidth capabilities that is the enabler of our
work. We use real world measurements and build the system
that fills the gap between optical and IP layers. Fischer et al.
[8] and Teipen et al. [26] efforts towards commercializing
higher-speed optical transmission have demonstrated the
need for advanced modulation formats, several of which
require similar transceiver hardware architecture. Their work
showed that adaptive transceivers can be built to support a
number of possible operational configurations but without
real-time reconfiguration mechanism. In this paper, we
discuss advantages of reconfigurable capacities in real-time
based on live SNR measurements.

9 CONCLUSION
In this work, we quantify the throughput and reliability
benefits of rate adaptive wide area networks. Our analysis of
the SNR of over 2,000 links in an optical backbone for a
period of 3 years shows that the capacity of 64% of IP links
can be increased by ≥75Gbps, yielding an overall throughput
gain of 134 Tbps. Furthermore, 25% of link failures can be
avoided by reducing the transmission rate to 50 Gbps from
100 Gbps. To leverage these benefits, we present RADWAN,
a traffic engineering system that dynamically adapts link
rates to enhance network throughput and availability. We
evaluate RADWAN in a testbed with 1,540 km optical fiber
and also simulate throughput and availability gains at scale.
In comparison to state-of-the-art software WANs, RADWAN
has 40% higher network throughput in a realistic network
with elastic traffic demands. We also address the challenge of
the hardware delay in modifying a link’s capacity. We
analyze the cause of this delay in current optical transceivers
and propose a potential solution to reduce this delay from
over a minute to a few milliseconds.
