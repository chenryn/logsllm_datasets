User: I have a script. It uses GTK. And I need to know if another copy of scrip starts. If it starts window will extend.
Please, tell me the way I can detect it.
Assistant: You could use a D-Bus service. Your script would start a new service if none is found running in the current session, and otherwise send a D-Bus message to the running instace (that can send "anything", including strings, lists, dicts).
The GTK-based library libunique (missing Python bindings?) uses this approach in its implementation of "unique" applications.
