totically more space as the second norm of the sampled substream
with probability Ω(δ−1). Since

Count Sketch is known to have an error of Ω
for streams
with a second norm of L2, we get that for an error of ϵL2 one would
need to use more counters per row, or wait longer for the algorithm
to converge. That is, a uniform sampling with the same update rate

would require a multiplicative Ω(cid:0)log δ−1(cid:1) more space.

To begin, we first discuss a lower bound on the error of Count
Sketch. In Count Sketch, one uses a matrix of w columns and
d = O(log δ−1) to get Pr
guarantee, one then sets w = O(ϵ−2). We now show that this is
asymptotically tight. Namely, we show that there exists a distribu-
tion for which Pr
(cid:104)|(cid:98)fx − fx | ≥ ϵL2
(cid:105) ≤ δ. For an ϵL2

To prove our result, we use the following theorem.

Var[X] ≥ 40000. Then for all t ∈ [0, Var[X]/100], we have

We are now ready to show a lower bound on the error of Count
Sketch.
LEMMA 8. Let n ≥ m + 1. Consider Count Sketch allocated with
d = O(log δ−1
1 ) rows and w ≤ m/c′ columns, for a sufficiently large
constant2 c′. There exists c = Θ(1), a stream S ∈ [n][m], and an
element x ∈ [n] such that Pr

and by z = O(1) the constant such that d = z ln δ−1

4z be two con-
stants. We will show that with probability of at least e−z, each
row has an error of at least c · L2/√

would not need sketches, and this trivially holds.

Here, the last inequality follows as (cid:220)fx ≤ fx ≤ L2. We now use
Lemma 6 to get that with a very high probability, L2 > w. Intu-
itively, this follows from our convergence criteria (Algorithm 1,
Line 14). This means that conditioned on L2 > w (which happens
with probability 1 − δ), we have that

Consider the stream in which all elements of [m] arrive once each

(and thus, L2 =
fx = 0). Fix a row i, and let
Q ≜ {j ∈ [m] | hi(j) = hi(x)} be the elements that affect x’s counter
on the i’th row. Intuitively, we show that the number of items that
change x’s counter (Ci,h(x)) is |Q| = Ω (L2/w) and then give a
lower bound on the resulting value of the counter (given that some
of the flows in Q increase it while others decrease). Observe that
|Q| ∼ Bin(m, 1/w). According to Chernoff’s bound:
−c′/8 ≤ 1 − e

Next, we denote by X ≜ {j ∈ Q | дi(j) = +1} the number of ele-
ments from Q that increased the value of x’s counter. Observe that
X ∼ Bin(|Q|, 1/2) is binomially distributed and that x’s counter sat-
isfies ci,hi(x) = 2X − |Q|. Conditioned on the event |Q| > m/2w
(which happens with constant probability as (9) shows), we have that
Var[X] = |Q|/4 ≥ m/8w = c′/8 ≥ 40000. According to Theorem 7,
