A.1 Impact of UE-Specs and Capabilities
Figure 23: Support
schemes in 5G-NR radios boost throughput performance.
for improved carrier aggregation
Commercial 5G landspace has improved over time along several
dimensions. Most notably for this experiment that tries to quantify
the impact of UE-specs on network performance, we find that latest
high-end smartphones such as S20U are able to improve downlink
and uplink throughput by increasing the number of radio chan-
nels (often referred to as carrier aggregation) used between the UE
and RAN. For example, previous generation of 5G smartphones
(e.g., considered in the baseline w/ QC X50 modem [7]) as well as
the cheaper variants of mmWave 5G phones (e.g., PX5 w/ QC X52
modem [9]) uses 4×100 MHz or 4CC (component carriers) for down-
link data transfers and 1CC for uplink. On the other hand, S20U
(w/ QC X55 modem [10]) supports 8CC over downlink (and 2CC
over uplink) resulting in significant improvements in throughput
performance. Fig. 23 compares the downlink and uplink through-
put between PX5 and S20U. Clearly, S20U provides 50% to 60%
improvements in both uplink and downlink throughput over PX5
and the baseline. Of course, harnessing for such carrier aggrega-
tion schemes over mmWave bands also requires support from 5G
carriers and their infrastructure. We did not find any significant
impact of UE specs over latency.
A.2 Impact of Server-Side & Other Factors
Due to mmWave 5G’s ultra-high throughput, performance bot-
tleneck can also be due to factors at end-devices. While we just
illustrated this on the UE-side, we now take a look at how server-
side and other factors might affect mmWave 5G’s performance.
We have already seen earlier (§3.2) that the default Linux kernel’s
TCP parameters such as tcp_wmem on the server-side need to be
increased drastically to improve single TCP connection throughput
and utilize mmWave 5G’s available bandwidth. Similarly, in the
future, when uplink throughput improves and more generically for
any transport protocol, careful attention is needed to ensure kernel
parameters on both (server and UE) ends are tuned to support ap-
plication needs and fully utilize mmWave’s ultra-high bandwidth
capacity. However, challenges lie to ensure such changes to trans-
port layer configurations do not adversely affect other connections
over the network that might not necessarily support or need such
high throughput.
