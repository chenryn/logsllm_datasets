I am developing a simple server application using Python 3, which I run with the following command:

```bash
python3 bbserver.py
```

Each time I do this, I receive an OS X popup that asks: "Do you want the application 'Python.app' to accept incoming network connections?"

To resolve this, I have tried making an exception for the `python3` executable in the firewall (there is no `python3.app`), and I have also attempted to code sign the Python 3 binary with a code signing certificate using the following command:

```bash
codesign -f -s mycodecert /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin/python3 --deep
```

However, these attempts have not been successful.

### For Anaconda Users on macOS Mojave

If you are using Anaconda and have recently updated to macOS Mojave, it's possible that you are running an outdated or unsigned version of Python. To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Update Conda:**
   ```bash
   conda update conda
   ```

2. **Update Python:**
   ```bash
   conda update python
   ```

This should update Python to the latest version, which should be signed, and the problem should be resolved. If the issue persists, you may need to contact Anaconda support to request a signed package.

Additionally, if you have multiple Conda environments, make sure to update Python in each environment by activating the environment and running the `conda update python` command.

If you continue to experience issues, please provide more details about your setup so that further assistance can be provided.
