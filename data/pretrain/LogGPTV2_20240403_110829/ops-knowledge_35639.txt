User: I am developing a simple python3 server app. I invoke it like this:
python3 bbserver.py
Each time after doing this I get the OSX popup:
Do you want the application “Python.app” to accept incoming network connections?
I've tried making an exception for python3 executable (there is no python3.app) in the firewall and have tried code signing with a codesign certificate thus:
codesign -f -s mycodecert /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin/python3 --deep
No luck.
Assistant: For Anaconda users who have updated to Mojave, you may be running an outdated/unsigned version of Python.
Simply run conda upgrade conda to update Python to the latest version, which should also be signed, and the problem should go away. If it doesn't, then you may need to contact Anaconda's support to get them to build a signed package.
Of course, you will also have to conda upgrade python for each conda environment you have.
