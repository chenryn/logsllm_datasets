### 5.1 Performance of the Classifier on the Dispute2014 Dataset

We evaluate the classifier's performance using the Dispute2014 dataset, with labels as described in Section 4.1. Given the nature of the peering dispute and its impact on flow congestion (Figure 5), we expect that no peak-hour flows between Cogent and three ISPs—Comcast, TimeWarner, and Verizon—would be classified as experiencing self-induced congestion in January-February. Conversely, all flows should be classified as self-induced congestion in March-April. However, due to various confounding factors, perfect labeling is not possible. Therefore, we look for a significant difference in the fraction of flows classified as self-induced congestion between the two timeframes, specifically a higher fraction in March-April.

**Figure 7: Performance of Our Classifier on Dataset 1**

The figure below shows, for each combination of transit ISP and access ISP, the fraction of flows in each timeframe that are classified as experiencing self-induced congestion (January-February in red, March-April in blue). We present the results for classification models built using three different thresholds for detecting access link congestion: 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9.

- **(a) Threshold 0.7**
- **(b) Threshold 0.8**
- **(c) Threshold 0.9**

The results align with our expectations. For Comcast, TimeWarner, and Verizon to Cogent, we observe a significantly lower fraction of flows classified as self-induced congestion in January-February compared to March-April. For example, in Figure 7(b), our classifier correctly identifies a higher fraction of self-induced congestion in March-April for these ISPs. The self-induced classification fractions remain similar in both periods for paths that did not experience congestion issues, such as Cox to Cogent servers and all ISPs to Level3.

### 5.2 Analysis of Latency and Throughput Data

**Figure 6: Sample Data from TSLP2017**

This figure presents latency and throughput measurements between an Ark node in a Comcast network in Massachusetts and an M-Lab node in New York City hosted by TATA. The data spans February 18 to February 22.

- **(a) Latency Measurements Using TSLP**
- **(b) Throughput Measurement Using NDT**

There are periodic spikes in latency, indicating congestion in the interdomain link between Comcast and TATA. These latency spikes correspond to drops in throughput for the Ark host. We label these periods as externally congested, while the other periods are labeled as self-induced. The service plan for the host is 25 Mbps downstream.

### 5.3 Results

In this section, we analyze the M-Lab datasets using our model to detect real-world peering incidents from the measurements.

**Figure 7: Performance of Our Classifier on Dataset 1**

- **(a) Threshold 0.7**
- **(b) Threshold 0.8**
- **(c) Threshold 0.9**

The classifier detects a higher fraction of self-induced bottlenecks in March-April than in January-February for paths that experienced congestion issues during January-February (Comcast, TWC, and Verizon to Cogent servers), but resolved them by March-April. Self-induced classification fractions are similar in the two periods for paths that did not have congestion issues in this timeframe (Cox to Cogent servers, and all ISPs to Level3).

By analyzing the results, we can see that the classifier effectively distinguishes between self-induced and externally induced congestion, providing valuable insights into the peering disputes and their resolution.
