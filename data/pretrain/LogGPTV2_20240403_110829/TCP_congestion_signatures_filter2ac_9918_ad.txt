Figure 6: Sample of the data we use in TSLP2017 showing mea-
surements of latency and throughput between an Ark node in
a Comcast network in Massachusetts and an M-Lab node in
New York City hosted by TATA. There are periodic spikes in la-
tency that indicate congestion in the interdomain link between
Comcast and TATA. These latency spikes correspond to drops
in throughput for the Ark host; we therefore label these periods
as externally congested and the other periods as self-induced.
The service plan for the host is 25 Mbps downstream.
5 RESULTS
In this section, we analyze the M-Lab datasets using our model and
show that it can detect the real-world peering incidents from the
measurements.
5.1 Performance of the classiﬁer on the
Dispute2014 dataset
We test the classiﬁer on the Dispute2014 dataset using labels that
we describe in § 4.1. Given the nature of the peering dispute and its
effect on ﬂow congestion (Figure 5), we would expect that with per-
fect labeling no peak-hour ﬂows between Cogent and three ISPs—
Comcast, TimeWarner, and Verizon—would be classiﬁed as experi-
encing self-induced congestion in the January-February timeframe,
while all ﬂows would be classiﬁed as self-induced congestion in
March-April. However, due to the number of confounding factors

Figure 7: Performance of our classiﬁer on Dataset 1. The clas-
siﬁer detects a higher fraction of self-induced bottlenecks in
March-April than in January-February for paths that had con-
gestion issues during January-February (Comcast, TWC, and
Verizon to Cogent servers), but resolved them by March-April.
Self-induced classiﬁcation fractions are similar in the two peri-
ods for paths that did not have congestion issues in this time-
frame (Cox to Cogent servers, and all ISPs to Level3).
that make our labeling imperfect, we look for a large difference in
the fraction of ﬂows to those ISPs classiﬁed as self-induced con-
gestion in the two timeframes, speciﬁcally a signiﬁcantly larger
fraction of ﬂows classiﬁed as self-induced congestion in the March-
April timeframe.
Figure 7 plots, for each combination of transit ISP and access ISP,
the fraction of ﬂows in each time frame that we classify as experi-
encing self-induced congestion (Jan-Feb in red, Mar-Apr in blue).
We separately plot the results we obtain for classiﬁcation models
built using three thresholds for detecting access link congestion:
0.7, 0.8, and 0.9. The results align with our expectation: we see a
signiﬁcantly lower fraction of ﬂows for Comcast, TimeWarner, and
Verizon to Cogent classiﬁed as self-induced in Jan-Feb compared to
Mar-Apr. For example, in Figure 7b, we see that our classiﬁer clas-
