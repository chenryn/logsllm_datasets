Search for “AUTO_STYLE” returns two API entries in the search results. Both
link to the same API page.
Searching for that in the API search revealed two entries as well: (1) in
core, which is deprecated and (2) in animations.
Curiously BOTH pages present the SAME content … the content for the one in
animations. The info about the deprecated `AUTO_STYLE` in core doesn’t appear.
The browser address bar shows the two different paths to that content.
There is an API filter for deprecated so clearly we intend to show deprecated
objects in the API search. The bug there is that we show the non-deprecated
animations content in the deprecated core link.
This may be **a symptom of a deeper problem with API pages** that have the
same title. It is unusual ... perhaps bad ... but not impossible for two
different modules to have an object with the same name (that's what is
happening here with `AUTO_STYLE`). If that is OK, then the content should be
different. I think a bug is causing the last-generated content to be assigned
to all links with the same title.
