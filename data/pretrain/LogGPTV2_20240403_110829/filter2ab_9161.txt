### Title: BlackHat EU-18: Don't Eat Spaghetti with a Spoon - An Analysis of the Practical Value of Threat Intelligence

**Threat Intelligence in Security Operations**

Threat Intelligence is a valuable component of a mature security operation. However, like many good concepts in the cybersecurity industry, its commercialization has led to commoditization and, in some cases, over-simplification that can be potentially dangerous. 

**Definition and Premise of Threat Intelligence**

True intelligence should provide non-obvious, actionable, and value-added information, derived through processing and interpretation. In reality, most commercial threat intelligence products operate on a simple premise: if an entity has been observed acting maliciously in one location, it is likely to do so in other locations. Based on this, threat intelligence feeds are sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars annually.

**Evaluating the Effectiveness of Threat Intelligence**

This talk will present an analysis of the effectiveness of threat intelligence in predicting malicious activity on the Internet. Our study involves the investigation of over one million internet threat indicators over a six-month period. We used a diverse set of sensors on real-world networks to track various types of malicious activities, including port scans, web application scans, DoS & DDoS attacks, and exploits.

**Methodology and Findings**

We tracked the behavior of detected malicious IP addresses over time, examining both "horizontal" and "vertical" correlations:
- **Horizontal Correlations:** The ability of one sensor to predict activity on another sensor or one target to predict activity on another.
- **Vertical Correlations:** The ability of a sensor to predict the persistence or re-appearance of an IP indicator.

By analyzing these correlations, we aim to provide insights into the practical value of basic threat intelligence offerings. This will help us better understand their role and significance in our security systems and processes.

**Data and Code Release**

All data and modeling code used in this analysis will be released after the presentation, allowing for further research and validation by the community.
