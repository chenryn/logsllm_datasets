* v3 hosts can specify source
 * Source Specific Multicast (SSM)
* Host indicates interest in receiving packets from certain sources, or
  to avoid certain sources, for group
* Membership report prcoess is
 * v3 report sent to 224.0.0.22 (IANA v3 membership report address)
 * Message type 0x22
 * Has SOURCE-INCLUDE 
* v3 compataible with v1 and v2
* Cisco designed URL Rendezvous Discovery and IGMP v3 lite for new
  features in v2 until v3 available in apps and OS
# v1 and v2 Interop
## v2 hosts and v1 routers
* v2 report message type 0x16, v1 says invalid message and ignores
* v2 hosts looks at MRT of periodic general IGMP query
 * Field 0 in v1
 * Non-zero in v2
* Marks interface as v1 int, stops sending v2 messages
* 400s v1 router present timer started on v1 query
 * If expires, send v2 messages
## v1 hosts and v2 routers
* v1 reports (0x12)
* IGMP hosts responds normally to v2 queries as very similar format to
  v1s (except second octet)
* If v2 hosts on same subnet, send v2 reports
 * v1 dont understand these, no report suppression
* v2 report would receive both v1 report and v2 in response to general
  query
* v2 router knows v1 on LAN
* Ignores leaves and GS
* Router suspends optimizations that reduce leave latency
* Ignored until IGMPv1-Host-Present-Countdown timer expires
* 2236 says routers sets if receivng v1 report
* Equal to group membership interval (180s in v1, 260 in v2)

# LAN Multicast Optimizations
## Cisco Group Management Protocol
* IGMP at L3
* Switches don't understand IGMP messages
* CGMP - L2 protocol
* Config'd on routers and switches
* Permits router to communicate L2 info learned from IGMP to switches
* Routers knows MACs of hosts and groups they're in
* With CGMP messages, switches can dynamically modify CAM entires
* Routers produce CGMP messages, switches listen
* Enable both ends of link
* L3 switches are routers for CGMP
* Server as CGMP servers only
* On these switches, CGMP can be enabled only on L3 ints that connect to
  L2 switches
```
int Fa0/1
 ip cgmp
```
* D-Addr of 0100.0CDD.DDDD
* Flooded through all ports, all switches get messages
* Useful info in messages is one or more pairds of MACs
 * GDA (Group Destination Address)
 * USA (Unicast Source Address)
1. CGMP router connected to switch, CGMP Join sent, GDA of 0, USA of own
MAC. CGMP knows m'cast router on port. Message repeat every 60s. CGMP
can be sent, same USA and GDA as Join.
2. IGMP join from host. Router examines L2 dest and source MAC of join.
   CGMP Join generated with M'cast MAC of group (GDA field) MAC of host
(USA field)
3. When switches receive above, search CAM for port with USA MAC.
   Creates new CAM entry (or uses existing if alreayd created) for
m'cast MAC in GDA. Adds port with host MAC in USA, forwards traffic to
port
4. IGMP Leave from host. Sees USA and group left. CGMP leave with
   multicast MAC for GDA of group, and unicast MAC in USA
5. Switch gets CGMP leave, looks for port with host MAC, removes from
   CAM entry for m'cast MAC in GDA
* IGMP messages optimized, switches know groups they go to (IGMP reports
  for example)
Combination of GDA and USA in CGMP messages mean: -
|Type|GDA|USA|Meaning|
|Join|Group MAC|Host MAC|Add USA port to group|
|Leave|Group MAC|Host MAC|Delete USA port from Group|
|Join|Zero|Router MAC|Learn of CGMP router on port|
|Leave|Zero|Router MAC|Release CGMP router port|
|Leave|Group MAC|Zero|Deletes group from CAM|
|Leave|Zero|Zero|Deletes all groups from CAM|
* Last message used with things like **clear ip cgmp**
## IGMP Snooping
* Multivendor
* Switch examines IGMP conversations
* Learns locations of routers and group members
General Process: -
1. Detects whether multiple routers on same subnet. Following messages
   determine which ports routers connected: -
 * IGMP general query - 01-00-5E-00-00-01
 * OSPF message - 01-00-5E-00-00-05 and 01-00-5E-00-00-06
 * PIMv1 and HSRP hellos - 01-00-5E-00-00-02
 * PIMv2 hellos - 01-00-5E-00-00-0D
 * DVMRP probes - 01-00-5E-00-00-04
 * When above seen, router port added to port list of all GDAs in that
   VLAN
2. When switch gets IGMP report, looks at GDA, creates CAM for GDA. Adds
   port to it and router port.
3. When IGMP leave, removes port from group in CAM. If last nonrouter
   port, switch discards leave, otherwise sends to router
* Requires hardware filtering support in switch (so can see IGMP reports
  during standard mc'ast traffic)
* Forwarding should be done in forwarding ASICs
* IGMP snooping enabled by default on 3560s and most other L3 switches
```
ip igmp snooping
no ip igmp snooping vlan 20
ip igmp snooping last-member-query-interval 500
ip igmp snooping vlan 22 immediate-leave
```
* Less efficient in maintaing group info
* General queries sent to 224.0.0.1 and forwarded through all ports in
  VLAN
* Hosts do not see each others IGMP reports (breaks report suppression)
 * Switch sends only one IGMP report per group to router
# Router-Port Group Manage Protocol
* L2 protocol
* Enables router to tell switch which groups it wants traffic for
* Helps routers reduce overhead when attached to highspeed LAN backbones
* Enable on interface **ip rgmp**
* Not compatible with CGMP
 * When enabled, CGMP silently disabled, and vice versa
* RFC 3488 exists, but is Cisco Proprietary
* Works with IGMP snooping
* IGMP helps switches control distribution of m'cast traffic for hosts,
  but not for routers
Four messages, sent to m'cast IP of 224.0.0.25: -
* When RGMP enabled, RGMP hello every 30s. When Switch receives it,
  stops forwarding all m'cast traffic on port
* To receive specific groups, RGMP Join G (G is m'cast address)
* RGMP Leave G to stop traffic
* RGMP Bye when RGMP disabled. Switch sends all IP m'cast traffic on
  port again
# IGMP Filtering
* Filters on SVI, port, or per-port per-VLAN basis
* Filters IGMP traffic
* Manages IGMP snooping
* Defines whether IGMP packet discarded or allowed
* with v1 and v2, entire packet discarded
* v3, packet rewritten, removing message elements denied
* Can restrict on groups that can be joined on port, maximum numbr of
  groups on interface, and IGMP version
* User policy applied to L3 SVI, L2 port or VLAN on trunk
 * L2 port can be access or trunk
* Only works if snooping enabled
* Three filters
 * IGMP group and channel access control
 * several IGMP groups and channels limit
 * IGMP minimum version
# IGMP Proxy
* Enables Unidirectional link routing environment to join m'cast group
  from upstream network
 * Not directly connected to downstream router
* Enables hosts to jon group source
 * Situations like internet gapped, no direct message
1. User 1 sends IGMP membership report to join group G
2. Router sends PIM Join to RP
3. RP receives PIM join, forwards entry for Group G on LAN
4. RP looks at mroute, proxies IGMP membership report to upstream UDL
   device
5. Proxy creates and mantains forwarding entry on UDL
