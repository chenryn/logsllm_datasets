Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of the template extraction:

**Original Log Line:**
```
NIFF: node node-176 has detected an available network connection on network 5.5.226.0 via interface alt0
```

**Extracted Template:**
```
NIFF: node node-<node_id> has detected an available network connection on network <network_address> via interface alt0
```

In this template:
- `<node_id>` represents the unique identifier for the node (e.g., `176`).
- `<network_address>` represents the IP address of the network (e.g., `5.5.226.0`).

This format clearly identifies the variable parts of the log line, making it easier to understand and use in various contexts.
