(64 projects reported this data point)

#### Initial Installation and Growth
In 2009, only 9.6 million smart meters were installed in the United States. By 2014, SGIG utilities had deployed over 16.3 million smart meters, representing approximately 29% of the 58.5 million smart meters installed nationwide. The majority of these installations (89%) were for residential customers, with 10% for commercial and 1% for industrial customers (see Figure 4).

**Figure 4: SGIG Smart Meter Installations by Customer Type**
- **Commercial**: 1,740,300
- **Industrial**: 54,651
- **Residential**: 14,545,806

### Smart Meters: Key Enabling Technology
Smart meters are the most numerous assets deployed in the SGIG Program and serve as a crucial enabling technology. Beyond remote meter reading, they provide additional functions such as:
- Remote connect/disconnect
- Tamper detection
- Outage monitoring
- Voltage monitoring
- Bidirectional measurement of electricity use

These capabilities support the adoption of distributed generation and dynamic pricing. Without smart meters and their associated communication and information management systems, many of the cost savings and demand-reducing benefits from AMI and customer systems would not be possible.

### Communications Networks and Systems
New smart meter functionalities require robust communication networks capable of delivering accurate, reliable, and voluminous data streams in real-time. These networks connect smart meters to head-end systems, which manage data communications between smart meters and other information systems, including MDMS, CIS, OMS, and DMS. The head-end system transmits and receives data, sends operational commands to smart meters, and stores interval load data to support customer billing.

Most SGIG utilities installed new or upgraded communication networks, leveraging various wired and wireless technologies (see Table 1). Utilities typically customized their systems, combining multiple approaches and integrating both legacy and new systems involving multiple vendor products.

**Table 1: Examples of AMI Communications Technologies**
- **Wired**: 
  - Fiber optic cable
  - Power-line communications (PLC)
  - Telephone dial-up modem
  - Digital subscriber line (DSL)
- **Wireless**: 
  - Radio Frequency (RF) – mesh network
  - RF – Point to multipoint
  - RF – Cellular

Choosing the most suitable communication technologies and configurations required utilities to consider multiple factors, including latency, bandwidth, cost, reliability, coverage, spectrum availability, backup power needs, and cybersecurity.

While there is no standard approach for AMI communication networks, most utilities use a two-layer system:
- **First Layer**: Connects intermediate data collection points (e.g., substations and communication towers) with headquarters' operations using high-speed fiber optic, PLC, microwave, and RF-cellular systems.
- **Second Layer**: Connects intermediate collection points with smart meters using RF mesh and PLC networks.

Many SGIG projects chose high-speed fiber optic or third-party cellular networks for backhaul, while wireless radio mesh networks were common for field communications.

### Integration with Information and Management Systems
Participating utilities aimed to maximize the value of smart meter deployments by integrating smart meter data with various information and data management systems, including:
- **MDMS**: Processes and stores interval load data for billing systems, web portals, and other information systems.
- **Billing Systems**: Automates bill generation using interval load data.
- **CIS**: Manages customer data, including locations, demographics, contact information, and billing histories.
- **OMS**: Isolates outage locations and connects with GIS for dispatching repair crews and managing service restoration.
- **DMS**: Implements electric reliability and voltage and VAR optimization procedures using data on outages and customer voltage levels.

Legacy systems were not designed to handle large volumes of interval load data from smart meters, necessitating ongoing integration efforts. Nearly all SGIG utilities integrated AMI with billing systems, while CIS and OMS systems were also popular choices (see Figure 5). Only six utilities integrated with DMS, as few were testing all functions of their new smart meters, such as voltage monitoring.

**Figure 5: Projects Integrating AMI with Key Information and Management Systems**
- **Distribution Management System**: 6
- **Outage Management System**: 37
- **Customer Information System**: 53
- **Billing**: 58

Integrating AMI with multiple systems unlocks new functions that improve grid efficiency, such as load research, forecasting, and demand-side program evaluation. Almost half of the SGIG AMI utilities (42%) integrated AMI with billing, CIS, and OMS, while 33% integrated AMI with just billing and CIS (see Figure 6).

**Figure 6: Projects Integrating AMI with Various Combinations of Information and Management Systems**
- **Billing + CIS + OMS + DMS**: 6
- **Billing + CIS + OMS**: 2
- **CIS + OMS**: 4
- **Billing + OMS**: 3
- **Billing + CIS**: 5
- **Billing**: 25

### Customer Systems
SGIG utilities installed over 400,000 Direct Load Control (DLC) devices and more than 250,000 Programmable Communicating Thermostats (PCTs) (see Table 2). These control technologies were the most numerous devices deployed, as utilities generally had the most experience with them. Customers received incentives for allowing utilities to use DLC devices to control appliances and equipment during peak demands. PCTs were also used to reduce peak demands by automatically adjusting air conditioner set points during critical peak events.

**Table 2: Number of Customer Systems Installed under SGIG**
- **Programmable Communicating Thermostat (PCT)**: 262,183
- **Energy Management System**: 21,228
- **Direct Load Control Device (DLC)**: 413,734
- **In-Home Display (IHD)**: 2,379
- **Smart Appliance**: 368

Other customer systems included over 20,000 IHDs, 368 smart appliances, and web portals offered by 49 utilities. These information technologies were less frequently used due to unfamiliarity and potential benefits. IHDs display consumption data, and web portals provide energy and billing dashboards. Some utilities also offered energy usage and cost information via text, email, or phone calls.

Smart appliances, such as refrigerators and dishwashers, can send or receive signals to remotely control certain functions. SGIG projects tested control of only a few hundred smart appliances, and further advancements in software, standards, and protocols are ongoing.

### Time-Based Rates and Demand-Side Programs
The deployment of AMI and customer systems enabled SGIG utilities to offer time-based rates and incentive-based programs that encourage customers to reduce electricity use, primarily during peak periods. Time-based rate programs vary by hour, day, or month, charging more during high-demand times and less during low-demand times. Some utilities offered incentive-based programs instead of or in addition to time-based rates.

**Table 3: AMI and Customer Systems Combine to Enable New Demand-Side Functions**
- **AMI-Enabled DSM Programs**: 
  - **Time-Based Rate Programs**
  - **Direct Load Control Programs**
  - **Information and Education Programs**

A total of 26 projects tested one or more time-based rate options in combination with various customer systems. Ten SGIG utilities participated in Consumer Behavior Studies (CBS), evaluating customer acceptance, retention, and response, and addressing the cost-effectiveness of using time-based rates to achieve utility, customer, and societal objectives.

### Project Build and Impact Metrics
Each SGIG project collected and reported build metrics (number of installed devices, device functions, and costs) and impact metrics (e.g., avoided meter operations costs). DOE collaborated with each project team to develop a Metrics and Benefits Reporting Plan (MBRP) outlining data collection and reporting. The analysis involved assessing four key components (see Figure 7) and lessons learned.

**Figure 7: SGIG Analysis Process**
- **Assets**: e.g., smart meters and DLC devices
- **Functions**: e.g., remote service connections/disconnections and demand management
- **Impacts**: e.g., reduced truck rolls and lower peak demands
- **Benefits**: e.g., lower operating costs and reduced customer bills

### Key Data Limitations and Considerations
Utilities had varying levels of experience and expertise with AMI and customer systems, leading to different scales of technology deployment. Full-scale deployment yielded larger grid impacts, and more experienced utilities saw results more quickly. Several factors are important when evaluating report data:
- **Deployment Scales**: Not all 70 participating utilities deployed every technology or tested every function, making it difficult to aggregate data.
- **Data Relevance**: Utilities only reported on relevant data points, resulting in varying population sizes.
- **Cost Measurement**: Utilities did not always use uniform categories to measure and report costs, complicating data analysis.
- **Historical Baselines**: Some utilities had trouble establishing reliable historical baselines for measuring improved performance.

### Major AMI Findings: Improved Customer Service and Reduced Operational Costs
All SGIG AMI utilities used smart meters for automated meter reading, eliminating costly meter operations and automating bill generation. Many utilities also implemented additional functions such as remote connect/disconnect, tamper detection, outage monitoring, and voltage monitoring (see Table 4).

**Table 4: Number of Projects Implementing Combinations of Smart Meter Functions**
- **Remote Connect/Disconnect**: 38
- **Tamper Detection**: 7
- **Outage Monitoring**: 5
- **Voltage Monitoring**: 3
- **Other Combinations**: 2, 1, 1

Most utilities enabled tamper detection for over 90% of their smart meters, while fewer enabled remote connect/disconnect for at least 90% of their meters.

### Automated Billing and Remote Meter Reading, Connection, and Disconnection
The primary new capability driving AMI investments is the ability to generate automated, timely, and accurate bills, regardless of weather conditions or property access limitations. Once configured, AMI and billing systems generate consistent and accurate bills with fewer errors and customer complaints. Utilities can customize billing periods based on customer preferences and provide tailored supplemental usage and service quality information.

AMI also enables remote connections and disconnections and on-demand, out-of-cycle meter readings. These services, previously requiring scheduled appointments and service trucks, are now available on-demand, particularly valuable for seasonal or temporary residents.

For residential customers, utilities mostly used 1-hour meter-reading intervals, while commercial and industrial customers used 15-minute intervals. Shorter intervals are necessary for bills that include demand charges.

**Figure 8: Meter Reading Intervals Used**
- **Residential**: 
  - 1 hr: 52%
  - 30 min: 6%
  - 15 min: 42%
- **Commercial and Industrial**: 
  - 15 min: 42%
  - 30 min: 6%
  - 1 hr: 52%

Customers with concerns about high bills or unusual consumption patterns can access or request bill information on demand through the utility’s web portal or by contacting customer service representatives.
