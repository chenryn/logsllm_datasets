When the projects began in 2009, only 9.6 million smart meters were installed in the United States. SGIG 
utilities deployed more than 16.3 million smart meters—representing about 29 percent of the 58.5 
million smart meters installed nationwide by 2014.4 The vast majority of those were installed for 
residential customers (89 percent), while 10 percent were commercial installations and 1 percent were 
industrial installations (see Figure 4).  
Smart meters were the most numerous assets deployed in 
the SGIG Program and are a key enabling technology. In 
addition to remote meter reading, smart meters can 
provide other important functions, such as remote 
connect/disconnect, tamper detection, outage monitoring, 
voltage monitoring, and bidirectional measurement of 
electricity use to better enable adoption of distributed 
generation and dynamic pricing. Without smart meters, 
and the communications and information management 
systems that connect them, many of the cost savings and 
demand-reducing impacts and benefits from AMI and 
customer systems could not be realized.

Communications Networks and Systems 
New smart meter capabilities require communications networks that are capable of delivering accurate, 
reliable, and voluminous streams of data in a timely manner. These communication networks connect 
smart meters to head-end systems, which manage data communications between smart meters and 
other information systems including MDMS, CIS, OMS, and DMS. The head-end system transmits and

receives data, sends operational commands to smart meters, and stores interval load data from the 
smart meters to support customer billing.  
Most SGIG utilities installed new or upgraded communication networks to deploy smart meters. They 
leveraged a variety of wired and wireless communications technologies (see Table 1), considering how 
each technology fits with their operational goals, service area characteristics, and business process 
constraints. Utilities typically customized their own systems, combining multiple approaches and 
integrating with both legacy and new systems involving multiple vendor products.  
In addition, many utilities use common communications platforms to support multiple field devices 
including smart meters, customer systems, and distribution automation (DA) equipment. For example, 
fiber backhaul and wireless radio networks may use one protocol to support communications for 
automated feeder switching and another for smart metering.

•  RF – Point to multipoint 
•  RF – Cellular  
Choosing the most suitable communication technologies and configurations required utilities to 
examine multiple requirements, considering all smart technologies that may use the networks: 
Latency 
•  Bandwidth 
• 
•  Cost 
•  Reliability and coverage 
•  Spectrum availability5 
•  Backup power needs 
•  Cybersecurity considerations 
While there is no standard approach or configuration for communications networks that support AMI 
operations, most utilities use two-layer systems to communicate between head-end systems and smart 
meters. Typically, the first layer of the network connects intermediate data collection points (e.g., 
substations and communications towers) with headquarters’ operations and consists of high-speed, 
fiber optic, power-line communications (PLC), microwave, and RF-cellular systems for backhauling large 
volumes of data. Some utilities use existing supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) 
communications systems to support this layer. The second layer of the network typically connects the 
intermediate collection points with smart meters and use RF mesh and PLC communications networks. 
Many SGIG AMI and customer systems projects chose high-speed fiber optic or third-party cellular 
network for backhaul. Wireless radio mesh network was a common choice for field communications 
network.

of commercial users and state, county, and local governments, including commercial and non-commercial fixed and mobile 
wireless services, broadcast television and radio, satellite, and other services. Frequency bands are reserved for different uses. 
There is a finite amount of spectrum, but a growing demand for it. See FCC, “About the Spectrum Dashboard.”

Integration with Information and Management Systems 
Participating utilities aimed to extract as much value as possible from their smart meter deployments by 
integrating smart meter data with one or more information and data management systems, including:  
information systems. 
→  MDMS: process and store interval load data for billing systems, web portals, and other 
→  Billing systems: process interval load data to automate bill generation. 
→  CIS: process data from MDMS and connect with billing systems for storing data on customer 
→  OMS: process data about meter on/off status to isolate outage locations and often connect with 
locations, demographics, contact information, and billing histories. 
GIS for dispatching repair crews and managing the restoration of services. Outage data from 
smart meters is made more valuable to grid operators when it is integrated with GIS and data 
from customer call centers 
→  DMS: process data on outages and customer voltage levels for implementing electric reliability 
and voltage and volt-ampere reactive (VAR) optimization procedures. 
Legacy information and management systems—billing, CIS, OMS, and DMS—were not designed to 
handle large volumes of interval load data from smart meters. As a result, information and management 
systems integration is a necessary and ongoing process for all utilities involved in AMI deployment.  
Nearly all SGIG utilities integrated AMI with billing systems. CIS and OMS systems were also popular 
integration choices (see Figure 5). Only six utilities chose to integrate with DMS, as few utilities were yet 
testing all functions of their new smart meters, such as voltage monitoring, for example. It is anticipated 
that more utilities will be integrating AMI with DMS as systems mature.

Integrating AMI with multiple information and management systems unlocks a variety of new functions 
that improve the efficiency of grid operations. For example, smart meter data can be used for load 
research and forecasting, and to understand the effectiveness of demand-side programs given time of 
day, weather, and season. Almost half of the SGIG AMI utilities (42 percent) integrated AMI with billing, 
CIS, and OMS, while 33 percent integrated AMI with just billing and CIS (see Figure 6).

Customer Systems 
The SGIG utilities installed more than 400,000 DLC devices and more than 250,000 PCTs (see Table 2). 
These control technologies were the most numerous devices deployed, as the utilities generally had the 
most experience with this equipment. Customers received incentives for allowing utilities to use DLC 
devices to control various types of appliances and equipment—such as air conditioners, water heaters, 
and swimming pool and irrigation pumps—to reduce peak demands. PCTs were also used to reduce 
peak demands. During critical peak event days, the devices received signals from the utility to 
automatically raise air conditioner set points during peak periods and then automatically lower them 
when peak periods were over. PCTs 
were controlled by customers and 
were often used in conjunction with 
event-driven, time-based rates such 
as critical peak pricing (CPP) or 
critical peak rebate (CPR). In 
addition, HANs and energy 
management systems were installed 
to automatically control appliances 
in response to price signals, load 
conditions, or pre-set preferences.

Other customer systems deployed included more than 20,000 IHDs, 368 smart appliances, and web 
portals offered by 49 utilities. These information technologies were used to a lesser extent due to 
greater unfamiliarity with the technologies and their potential benefits and impacts. These information 
displays can be designed to guide customers about ways to reduce peak demand or achieve electricity 
conservation. IHDs are devices installed in homes that display consumption data in various formats for 
customers. Most of the projects offered web portals that contain energy and billing dashboards tailored 
for each participating customer. In addition, several utilities offered energy usage and cost information 
via text message, email, or phone calls for laptop, tablet, and mobile phone access.  
Smart appliances such as refrigerators and dishwashers come pre-installed with “smart chips” and can 
send or receive signals that enable the timing of certain functions (e.g., defrost cycles) to be remotely 
controlled. SGIG projects tested control of only a few hundred smart appliances. Power companies and 
15 
equipment manufacturers are working to further advance software, standards, and protocols for smart 
appliances.  
In general, residential customer systems are relatively new, with much still unknown about cost-
effectiveness and customer acceptance. This report describes results from the limited number of SGIG 
utility experiences. While SGIG projects reported on the costs of customer system implementation, a 
lack of consistency in how each utility defined and measured cost categories did not result in consistent 
aggregated cost data. The Project Information Page on SmartGrid.gov includes individual project 
information on costs and benefits.  
Time-Based Rates and Demand-Side Programs 
The deployment of AMI technologies in tandem with customer-based systems unlocked new capabilities 
for SGIG utilities to offer time-based rates and incentive-based programs that encourage customers to 
reduce electricity use, primarily during peak periods.  
Time-based rate programs come in many forms and offer various levels of electricity prices that may 
differ by the hour, day, or month. As such, these rate programs typically charge more for electricity 
during times when power supply costs and demand are relatively high (such as hot summer days), and 
less during times when power supply costs and demand are relatively low. Some utilities offered 
incentive-based programs instead of, or in addition to, time-based rate programs to achieve demand-
side objectives.  
Table 3 demonstrates how SGIG utilities were able to offer new demand-side management (DSM) 
functions only by deploying a combination of AMI and customer system technologies.

A total of 26 projects tested one or more time-based rate options in combination with various customer 
systems. Ten SGIG utilities also participated in special Consumer Behavior Studies (CBS), which evaluated 
customer acceptance, retention, and response, and addressed the cost-effectiveness of using time-based

rates to achieve utility, customer, and societal objectives. Highlighted results are included in Section 3 and 
detailed results and lessons learned can be found on the SGIG-CBS website. 
1.2  Project Build and Impact Metrics 
Each SGIG project collected and reported two types of metrics: 1) build metrics, including the number of 
installed devices, device functions, and their costs; and 2) impact metrics (e.g., avoided meter 
operations costs) that assessed the effects of the new technologies and systems on grid operations and 
business practices. Appendix B includes a detailed review of the data collection and analysis process. 
At the outset of the SGIG program, DOE collaborated with each of the project teams to develop a 
Metrics and Benefits Reporting Plan (MBRP) outlining how the utility would collect and report metrics 
over the course of the project. DOE analysis of the SGIG AMI and customer systems projects involved 
the assessment of four key components (see Figure 7), along with lessons learned. 
Figure 7. SGIG Analysis Process 
•  Assets (e.g., smart meters and DLC devices) 
•  Functions (e.g., remote service connections/disconnections and demand management) 
• 
•  Benefits (e.g., lower operating costs and reduced customer bills) 
Impacts (e.g., reduced truck rolls and lower peak demands)  
Because AMI involves not only new technologies but also new business practices and procedures, DOE 
analysis also included assessment of lessons learned and best practices from the SGIG projects. 
1.3  Key Data Limitations and Considerations 
Each utility had a different level of experience and expertise with AMI and customer systems at the 
project outset, and deployed technologies at widely different scales. Full-scale technology deployment 
yielded larger grid impacts. More experienced utilities faced fewer hurdles and saw results more quickly. 
Utilities that had steeper learning curves were primarily interested in testing and learning—rather than 
generating large grid and customer impacts—and therefore yielded limited impact data.  
Several factors are important to consider when evaluating report data:  
•  The AMI and customer systems projects deployed technologies at different scales, and not all 
of the 70 participating utilities deployed every technology or tested out every function—
making it difficult to meaningfully aggregate data on technology cost, performance, and 
benefits across all 70 projects. For example, some projects tested only remote 
connect/disconnect and tamper detection functions, while others tested only outage reporting 
or voltage monitoring functions. About 52 percent had greater than 90 percent deployment of 
AMI, while 17 percent deployed AMI to less than 20 percent of their systems. 
17 
o  Utilities only reported on data points relevant to their projects, and therefore the 
population size for each data point varies—which is why there are notations such as “50 
projects reported this data point” in charts or graphs throughout the report.  
•  Utilities did not always use uniform categories to measure and report purchasing, installation, 
and implementation costs, making it difficult to accurately differentiate between several line 
items for data analysis.  
•  Reported asset costs from one utility cannot be directly compared to another utility. 
Individual case studies include certain project costs and benefits to provide a range of 
examples on the technology cost-benefit ratio. Costs vary greatly from utility to utility based on 
their project size, system design, and previously installed systems and technologies. In addition, 
equipment costs for certain devices have also changed since the program began in 2010. 
•  Some utilities had trouble establishing reliable historical baselines from which to measure 
improved performance. Accurately measuring the impact of AMI and customer system 
technologies required consistent measurement of historical performance—before the 
technologies were implemented. Several utilities underestimated the time, effort, and 
engineering expertise required to accurately measure smart grid impacts and historical 
baselines.

2  Major AMI Findings: Improved Customer Service and 
Reduced Operational Costs 
All SGIG AMI utilities used smart meters for automated meter reading—which was the primary driver of 
utility investment in AMI because of its ability to eliminate costly meter operations and automate bill 
generation. Many utilities also purchased smart meters with one or more additional functions: remote 
meter connection and disconnection, tamper detection, outage monitoring, and voltage monitoring (see 
Table 4). About 64 percent implemented all four of the other main smart meter functions.

The vast majority of the 53 utilities that enabled tamper detection did so for over 90 percent of their 
smart meters. Tamper detection is usually performed on aggregate smart meter data in the MDMS. In 
contrast, utilities may choose to implement remote connection and disconnection capabilities only on 
feeders with relatively high levels of customer turnover. Less than half of the 55 utilities that enabled 
remote connection/disconnection enabled the feature on at least 90 percent of their smart meters.  
2.1  Automated Billing and Remote Meter Reading, Connection, and 
Disconnection 
The primary new capability driving AMI investments is the ability to generate automated, timely, and 
accurate bills, regardless of weather conditions or property access limitations, which traditionally 
hamper collection of meter information. Once properly configured, AMI and billing systems generate 
more consistent and accurate bills automatically, with fewer recording errors and customer complaints. 
Because data intervals can be specified in 15-minute increments, utilities can customize billing periods 
based on customer preferences rather than on meter reading schedules set by the utility. Utilities can 
also supply customers with tailored supplemental usage and service quality information as added 
features in either paper or electronic form. 
19 
AMI also enables remote connections and 
disconnections and on-demand, out-of-cycle 
meter readings. Remote service switching is the 
capability to turn meters on and off to support 
changes in occupancy, reoccurring non-payment 
issues, and prepaid service offerings. In cases of 
emergency, the remote service switch may be 
used to support firefighters and other first 
responders.  
These services previously would have required 
scheduling service appointments and waits of up 
to several days for service trucks to arrive. On-
demand services are particularly valuable for 
seasonal or temporary residents who typically 
have variable schedules and needs for assistance. 
For residential customers, utilities most used 1-
hour meter-reading intervals, which is sufficient 
for billing purposes and is the way most utilities 
use the data in web portals when presenting 
feedback about electricity consumption to 
customers. For commercial and industrial 
customers, utilities mostly used 15-minute meter-
reading intervals. The shorter intervals are 
necessary when bills also include demand charges. 
Figure 8 shows the distribution of meter reading 
intervals used by the SGIG projects. 
Customers with concerns about high bills or 
unusual consumption patterns can access or 
request bill information on demand using the 
utility’s web portal or calling a utility’s customer 
service representatives.
