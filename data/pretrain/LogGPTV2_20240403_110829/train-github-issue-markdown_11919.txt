Building on a question I asked on StackOverlow, I was wondering if it would be
a nice addition if it would be possible to define types recursively. If I am
guessing correctly this wouldn't be too difficult to implement.
Example:
    type Document = [number | string | Array]
Currently, according to the spec, only classes and interfaces are allowed to
reference themselves. Is there a reason for this?
