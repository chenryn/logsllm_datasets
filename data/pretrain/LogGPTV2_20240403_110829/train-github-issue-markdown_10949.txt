I had originally installed atom via `brew cask install` and the `atom` command
was working fine. Then, for reasons, I uninstalled the cask version and
installed atom from atom.io. Ever since, despite performing "Install Shell
Commands" and making sure the symlinks are correct, the `atom` command fails
to load the current folder. It's highly likely this is isolated to my
installation only, but I'm having a hard time figuring out where things go
wrong.
I have tried:
  * Removing ~/.atom entirely
  * Exporting a nearly uncustomized `$PATH` before launching atom
  * Atom -> Install Shell Commands (and manually checking the symlinks after)
  * Launching from various folders, just in case there was something weird in the pathname
So far nothing has worked.
Atom seems to be getting the `--executed-from` argument just fine and with a
correct value. For example, if I launch atom in /tmp, I can see the following
command with `ps aux | grep -i atom`:
    /Applications/Atom.app/Contents/MacOS/Atom --executed-from=/tmp --pid=77617 --path-environment=/Users/redacted/.bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
The launched editor just shows a blank untitled document, does not open the
tree view, and Cmd+P says that the project is empty. The `--pid` doesn't point
to any existing process but then again I don't really know what it's for
anyway.
File -> Open does work.
Any ideas? I'm on 0.209.0 currently but the issue has persisted for a month or
so.
Here's the path to the atom script in case it helps:
    âžœ  /tmp  readlink /usr/local/bin/atom
    /Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/atom.sh
