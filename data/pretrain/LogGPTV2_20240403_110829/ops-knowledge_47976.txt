User: I am trying to access the curl executable on my computer using a subprocess call, but when I do so, I get the following error:
WindowsError: [Error 2] The system cannot find the file specified
my code looks as follows
path = 'C:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Local\\Continuum\\Anaconda2\\Library\\bin\\curl.exe
subprocess.call([path])
I know the path is correct, is there a reason that my script is balking at this?
As you can see, I am running the Anaconda2 Python Interpreter, not the standard one from Python.org
Assistant: Take a step back and do some sanity checks. Here are some steps to try.

Copy the path in your script, and paste it into the file explorer (remove the escape characters) and verify that the path is indeed correct.
Verify that you have proper permissions to the path
* Copy the executable (curl.exe) to a same location your python script is at, this eliminates the need to specify a path (sanity check)
import subprocess
path = 'curl.exe'
subprocess.call([path])

If this works, you can then move it your expected path and verify
