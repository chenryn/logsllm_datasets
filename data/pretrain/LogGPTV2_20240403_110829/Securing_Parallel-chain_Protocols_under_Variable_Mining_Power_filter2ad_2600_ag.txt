which leads to a contradiction as Di(U i)  0 an arbitrary honest block that is computed at round r
r . Let B be the set of these blocks and note that their
for difficulty Qi
difficulties sum to Qi(S). Then consider a block B ∈ B extending a
chain C∗ and let d = diff(C∗B). If d ≤ diff(C∩C′) (note that u diff(C∩C′), note that there is a unique B∈B such that
d ∈ B. Since B cannot simultaneously be on chain C and C′, there is
a B0 (cid:60)B either on C or on C′ that contains d. Hence there exists a
set of blocks B′ computed in U such that B∩B′ = and {d ∈ B : B ∈
B}⊆{d ∈ B : B∈B′}. Because each block in B′ contributes either to
Di(U)−Qi(S) or to Ai(J), we have Qi(Si)≤ Di(U i)−Qi(S)+Ai(J i).

C.3 Chain Quality of Non-pivot Chains
Proof of Lemma 6.14. Without loss of generality, we focus on
the first non-pivot chain. Let Bi denote the i-th block of C and con-
sider K consecutive blocks Bu,··· , Bv in C with timestamp in S0.
Define K0 as the least number of consecutive blocks Bu′,···,Bv′ that
include the K given ones (i.e., u′≤u and v ≤v′) and have the prop-
erties (1) that the block Bu′ was mined by an honest party at some
round r1 or is the genesis block in case such block does not exist, and
(2) that there exists a round r2 such that the chain ending at block Bv′
is adopted by some honest node at round r2. Let d′ be the total diffi-
culty of these K′ blocks. Define U ={r1,···,r2}, S ={r1 +∆,···,r2−∆},
and J the adversarial queries in U associated with the K′ blocks.
Then we have |S| =|U |−2∆≥ |S0|−2∆≥ ℓ. Then following the same

argument from Lemma 6.13, we have A

are included in the K blocks and—towards a contradiction—assume

C.4 Common Prefix
i
and Chain Quality of the Leader Sequence
Proof of Lemma 6.15. Let r ≥ Rd +2ℓ+4∆ be the current round.
For 1≤ i ≤m, let Ci be the heaviest voter chain i in an honest node
u’s view at round r. By the common prefix property in Lemma 6.13,
blocks in C⌈ℓ+2∆
remain unchanged until rmax. In addition, by the
chain quality property in Lemma 6.14, we know that for 1≤ i ≤ m,
there exists at least one honest block Bi on chain Ci whose times-
tamp is in the interval (r −2ℓ−4∆,r −ℓ−2∆),i.e., Bi is on the chain
C⌈ℓ+2∆
. As Bi is an honest block mined after Rd, Bi or an ancestor
i
of Bi must have voted for the difficulty level d. Therefore the leader
sequence remains unchanged up to difficulty level d until rmax. □
Proof of Lemma 6.16. Let r be the current round, C be the pro-
poser chain held by honest player P, and d = diff(C). Let interval
D = (d′,d] be the difficulty range covered by all blocks in C with
timestamp in last ℓ+2∆ rounds. Define:
∗ :=max(cid:0) ˜d ≤d
the first proposer block covering ˜d(cid:1)
′
s.t the honest players mined
d
Let r∗ be the round in which the first proposer block covering d∗
was mined. r∗ =0 and d∗ =0 if such proposer block does not exists.
Define U = {r∗,··· ,r}, S = {r∗ + ∆,··· ,r − ∆}, and J the adversarial
queries in U . Then we have |S| =|U |−2∆≥ ℓ. From the definition of
d∗ we have the following two observations:
(1) All difficulties in(d∗,d′] are covered by at least one adversarial
proposer block.
Session 6A: Consensus and Attacks CCS ’21, November 15–19, 2021, Virtual Event, Republic of Korea1717(2) All the proposer blocks covering(d∗,d] are mined in the inter-
val U because there are no proposer blocks covering d∗ before
round r∗ and hence no player can mine a proposer block
covering a difficulty level greater than d∗ before round r∗.
Let Lh be the size of difficulty range covered by honest leader
blocks in the range (d′,d] and say
Lh < µ(d−d
′)≤ µ(d−d
∗).
(6)
Let L′
be the size of difficulty range covered by honest leader blocks
in the range (d∗,d′]. The adversarial leader blocks have covered
h
difficulty ranges with size d−d∗−Lh−L′
in the interval U . From our
first observation, we know that adversarial proposer blocks in the
difficulty range [d∗,d′] which are not leader blocks cover difficulty
ranges with size at least L′
, and from our second observation, these
