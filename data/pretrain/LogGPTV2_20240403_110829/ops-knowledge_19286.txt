**Subject: Need Assistance Installing PyDev in Eclipse**

Hello,

I am having trouble installing PyDev in Eclipse and would greatly appreciate any help. I have tried the following methods, but all have failed:

1. **Using Update Site:**
   - **Issue:** Errors occur during installation, which appear to be related to a firewall.
   
2. **Downloading and Extracting the PyDev ZIP File:**
   - **Method 1:** Extracted the ZIP file directly into the Eclipse folder.
     - **Issue:** After restarting Eclipse, PyDev could not be found in the preferences.
   - **Method 2:** Extracted the ZIP file into the `dropins` folder.
     - **Issue:** After restarting Eclipse, PyDev could not be found in the preferences.

I am very frustrated with this situation and would greatly appreciate any assistance. Here are the details of my environment:

- **Operating System:** Mac OS X 10.8
- **Eclipse Version:** 3.7
- **PyDev Version:** 3.0
- **Country:** China

Thank you in advance for your help.

**Response from Assistant:**

I had a similar problem, and opening Eclipse as an administrator resolved it. This might be worth trying, although I'm not entirely sure if it will work in your case. 

To open Eclipse as an administrator on a Mac, follow these steps:
1. Open Terminal.
2. Navigate to the Eclipse application directory using the `cd` command.
3. Run the following command to open Eclipse with elevated privileges:
   ```sh
   sudo open Eclipse.app
   ```

Please let me know if this helps or if you need further assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
