#### Figure 10: Probability of All Outgoing Connections Made to Shadow IPs for Varying Attack Durations (Days)
In all experiments, the attacks are non-adaptive for fair comparisons. We test various countermeasures in Section VII-C. As the probability decreases, the EREBUS attack becomes more challenging.

- **Attack Duration (days):** 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65

The EREBUS attack becomes more difficult as the probability of all eight outgoing connections being made to shadow IPs decreases. Increasing the table sizes, however, makes the EREBUS attack easier. Conversely, reducing the table sizes makes the attack less effective. The adversary achieves a higher success probability when the table size is increased. Unlike Eclipse attackers, an EREBUS adversary has significantly more bandwidth and IP addresses at their disposal.

However, the actual deployment of this change requires extensive community discussion, as reducing table sizes may limit the storage of benign and stable IPs in the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network, potentially affecting the peering dynamics of the system.

#### [C2] More Outgoing Connections
Another effective solution is to increase the number of outgoing connections that can be made from each Bitcoin node. Currently, the maximum is eight. By increasing this number, it becomes more difficult for an adversary to occupy all outgoing connections. As shown in Figure 10, doubling the number of outgoing connections significantly reduces the EREBUS adversary's success probability. Although the Eclipse attack paper also proposes a similar countermeasure, it has not been adopted in Bitcoin Core. The increase in outgoing connections must be carefully designed to avoid an abrupt increase in the number of peer connections and the total traffic volume, which could increase message and block delays in the Bitcoin network.

#### [C1] and [C2] Combined
We combine the two effective Bitcoin protocol modifications and evaluate their final detection effectiveness. The last line in Figure 10 shows the attack success probability when a Bitcoin node reduces the table sizes four times and doubles the number of outgoing connections. This combined approach makes the EREBUS attack extremely difficult, with only a 5% success probability even after two months of attack execution.

#### [C3] Incorporating AS Topology in Peer Selection
Another highly promising countermeasure is to make the peer selection algorithm aware of the AS-level topology. This way, the peering decision itself makes the EREBUS attack much harder. Specifically, we can use AS numbers to group IP addresses in the two tables instead of their prefix groups. This approach makes the attack harder or impossible for adversaries with IPs distributed across many prefix groups but hosted in a few ASes. For example, about 15% of Tier-1 ASes that do not have at least 100 shadow ASes would not be able to launch the EREBUS attack; see Figure 3 for the distribution of available shadow ASes.

#### [C4] Eviction Policy that Protects Peers Providing Fresher Block Data
A cross-layer defense approach is to improve the peer eviction policy so that the Bitcoin node retains peers that have propagated more recent block data. This makes censoring a specific block or transaction from the victimâ€™s view less effective if there exists a legitimate incoming connection providing fresher blocks.

#### Status of Our Countermeasures
We disclosed our findings to the Bitcoin core security team in early June 2019. As of July 1, 2019, the Bitcoin core developers are positively considering the deployment of countermeasures [C3] and [C4]. We will keep updating the status of these and any new countermeasures on our public project webpage at https://erebus-attack.comp.nus.edu.sg/.

### VIII. RELATED WORK

#### A. Attacks against Blockchain Peer-to-Peer Networks
As discussed in detail in Section II, the Bitcoin hijacking attack [3] and the Eclipse attack [29] are the closest to our attack. The EREBUS attack shares the same capabilities (e.g., being a large AS) and goal (e.g., hijack all peering connections of a targeted node) with the Bitcoin hijacking attack. However, the attack strategies differ, as the EREBUS is a data-plane attack, while the Bitcoin hijacking is a control-plane attack. The EREBUS attack does not exploit the vulnerabilities used by the Eclipse attack but leverages its topological advantage to hijack connections. The EREBUS's strategies, such as controlling a large set of IPs persistently for weeks, are unique and dissimilar to those of the Eclipse attack with botnets.

Biryukov et al. [10] proposed a network attack targeting Bitcoin nodes connecting through Tor, exploiting Bitcoin's DoS prevention mechanism to force all connections through adversary-controlled Tor exit nodes. Recently, an Eclipse attack has been demonstrated against the Ethereum peer-to-peer network [31]. For more comprehensive information about Bitcoin attacks, we refer readers to a recent survey by Bonneau et al. [15].

#### B. Proxies for Enhancing Bitcoin Peer-to-Peer Network
To enhance block propagation speed, several relay networks have been developed, such as SABRE [2], which provides a secure channel for Bitcoin nodes to connect and get mined blocks and transactions even when their network prefixes are BGP hijacked. SABRE can potentially mitigate the EREBUS attack but requires blind trust in a few SABRE relays, which does not solve the root problem of network adversary-based attacks. Malicious ASes can provide SABRE relay services for easier hijacking attacks.

Compared to third-party proxy-based solutions, our countermeasures in Section VII-C are more desirable as they do not require trust in external third parties and do not centralize the Bitcoin network.

#### C. Studies on Blockchain Peer-to-Peer Networks
Studying the underlying peer-to-peer networks of popular blockchains has been an interesting research area. Gencer et al. [23] show that Bitcoin and Ethereum are not decentralized in terms of mining power and network topology. Apostolaki et al. [3] found that only 13 ASes hosted 30% of Bitcoin nodes in 2017. A recent study [42] found that most Bitcoin nodes do not have the latest copy of the blockchain, making them vulnerable to partitioning attacks. Several studies have tried to discover the topology of the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network, such as AddressProbe [34] and TxProbe [18].

### IX. CONCLUSION
Whether it is a multi-billion dollar cryptocurrency or a toy blockchain, as long as they are permissionless, their distributed peer nodes heavily rely on the current Internet, where several large autonomous systems (ASes) can mount dangerous attacks. This paper shows that the topological advantage of these large ASes allows them to control the peer connections of a blockchain if its peer-to-peer protocol is not carefully designed with the EREBUS attack in mind. We hope that our work sparks new discussions on hardening thousands of cryptocurrencies against powerful, sophisticated (e.g., state-sponsored) network adversaries.
