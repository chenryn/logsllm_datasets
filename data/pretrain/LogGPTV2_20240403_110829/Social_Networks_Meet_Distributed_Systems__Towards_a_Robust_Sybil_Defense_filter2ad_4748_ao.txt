the MinEC heuristic fares as good as the One-Hop heuristic
for k ≤ 500 on AstroPhysics and Epinions and k ≤ 2000
on Facebook. The Degree heuristic fares worse than the
Two-Hop heuristic for k ≤ 200 for each dataset, and then
gradually gets better upto k = 1000, before ﬁnally worsen-
ing again. In contrast, the Common Neighbors and Random
heuristics ﬂuctuate in their attack resilience as k increases.
Across all the heuristics based on selective 2-hop neighbors,
as the number of 2-hop neighbors increases beyond k > 2000,
the security of random walks worsens as poorly as that of
the Two-Hop heuristic. This is because the resultant overlay
for such a high value of k essentially becomes a 2-hop net-
work where each honest node is connected to every 2-hop
neighbor in the original graph.
Sybil Node Degree. Figure 9 shows the impact of the
average degree of Sybil nodes in the Sybil region. Increase
in the average Sybil node degree has little impact on the
network connectivity of the honest region7, while having a
variable eﬀect on the attack resilience for each heuristic. As
the average Sybil node degree increases, the Random, De-
gree and Two-Hop heuristics fare worse in terms of escape
probability. This is because the probability of a Sybil node
getting selected as a 2-hop neighbor in the ranked lists of
honest nodes increases with the average Sybil node degree
with these heuristics. In contrast, the Common Neighbors,
the MinEC and One-Hop heuristics have marginal eﬀect on
their attack resilience when average Sybil node degree is in-
creased. This is because the Common Neighbors and One-Hop
heuristics do not take into account the degree of the Sybil
nodes, while the MinEC heuristic in fact discourages high de-
gree Sybil nodes and encourages greater overlap of its 1-hop
neighbors.

Sybil Region Structure and Attack Edge Placement.
So far, we considered the adversary creating both the Sybil
region with a graph structure based on the Barab´asi-Albert
preferential attachment model [9] and the attack edges strate-
gically with higher degree honest nodes. We now examine
the eﬀect on the robustness of the system when (i) the Sybil
region is created with a structure based on the Erd˝os-R´enyi
random graph model [15] having the same average Sybil
node degree, and/or (ii) the same number of attack edges
(g) are created arbitrarily, with no relation to the degrees of
either honest or Sybil nodes.
Figure 10 shows the impact of the graph structure of the
Sybil region. In terms of disconnection probability, all the
combinations have similar eﬀect on the network connectiv-
ity across all datasets and heuristics.
In terms of escape
probability, Barab´asi-Albert model structure results in a
signiﬁcantly worse attack resilience for Random, Degree and
Two-Hop heuristics while having similar impact on the other
heuristics. This result implies that the Two-Hop heuristic
similar to the one proposed in the MCON study [28] fares
very poorly in our system in terms of attack resilience, de-
spite enabling high network connectivity. Moreover, the
result shows that our experiments throughout this section
7Henceforth, due to space limitations, we do not show the results
of the experiments in which varying the values of a parameter
does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect a performance metric.
