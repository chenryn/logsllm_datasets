meant for computationally limited mobile devices, Random
Art’s computation requirement makes it a suboptimal choice.
This comparison is summarized in Table VI, where a (cid:4)

Additional beneﬁts.
A scheme is describable if users
can clearly describe the representation without showing it to
another user (e.g., speaking the characters directly or stating
the colors). It is very difﬁcult to accurately describe some of
the schemes. English words and Base32 can be easily spelled
using letters and numbers (or words if the English words
are common). A user will be unable to accurately describe
Random Art images since some Random Art images contain
a series of bars as part of a gradient of one color, but of
different widths. A user can describe the colors, shapes, and
order in T-Flag and Flag Extension. In Flag, minor variations
in the colors may be difﬁcult to describe without knowledge
of the underlying RGB values. For Asian characters, users
that speak the language can speak the given characters, but
others may have trouble describing the characters. Even for
random Korean characters, those familiar with the language
can decompose the characters into the proper jamos.
B. Limited Entropy of the Hash Comparison Schemes
Each hash comparison scheme represents a hash h by an
image or text representation R(h) that outputs around 20-
30 bits of entropy. To subvert most protocols, an attacker
has to break the second-preimage resistance of the hash
representation, as opposed to the hash (i.e., given a hash h
(cid:7)
such that
the attacker ﬁnds some different data and hash h
h (cid:8)= h
(cid:7))). Given modern devices can perform
(cid:7)
220 or more hash computations a second, it is feasible for
, but R(h) = R(h

an attacker to ﬁnd such a h
in a few minutes.
To prevent attacks, we could encode the entire output of
a secure hash function (such as all 160 bits from SHA-1)
by a hash representation. However, increasing entropy is not
a solution because it sacriﬁces usability and accuracy. With
more entropy, representations will contain longer sequences
of characters or more minute details which will lead to
increased time and errors during comparisons.
Rather than increasing entropy, the protocol should use
commitments [17] or other techniques to ensure security.
Commitments make participants’ inputs to the hash rep-
resentations unpredictable and prevent participants from
modifying their data in response to other participants data.
Without prior knowledge of the inputs and no way to change
inputs after learning other participants’ inputs, a malicious
party is limited to a single attempt to ﬁnd a collision for the
hash representation. With a single guess, the chance of two
hash representations with n bits of entropy being equal is
2n−1.
VII. CONCLUSION
We found that Base32, Random Art, T-Flag, and Flag
Extension provide the best balance across all properties—
quick high accuracy comparison independent of language
ability. We conclude with a decision tree (Fig. 6) that
suggests proper visual comparison schemes (out of these
four schemes) based on device’s capability, i.e., whether
a device has a high resolution display and/or sufﬁcient
computation power. Hence, these suggested schemes offer
the best tradeoffs among accuracy, speed, and usability for
each branch.

Orlitsky et al. [18] propose a statistic estimator ˆk(Nr, r)

Here Nr is the number of samples until there are r repeti-
tions. For example, in a sequence of c, g, c, s, g, c, v, N1 =
3, N2 = 5, N3 = 6. In the context of image sampling, we
deﬁne a repetition to be an image that is perceptually similar
to a previous shown image.
Equation 2 shows the conﬁdence level of this estimator,
expressing by the probability that the estimate falls outside
of [k(1−α), k(1 +α).

The result of PerceptualDiff (together with our manual
inspection) shows that there are 4 repeated instances (i.e.,
perceptually similar images) in the ﬁrst 3709 samples. Fig. 7
shows that image (b) and (c) “repeat” image (a), and image
(e) and (f) “repeat” image (d), i.e., α = 3. We conclude that
the number of perceptually different images generated by
Random Art is 37092/4 = 3439170.25 ≈ 221.71, with only
8.6% that Random Art will carry more than 23.71 bits or
less than 19.71 bits.

APPENDIX
Despite that Random Art is designed to encode a large
amount of entropy (e.g., 160 bits of SHA-1) [12], to the
best of our knowledge, there is no theoretical analysis show-
ing that its perceptual entropy (the amount of information
perceived by humans) is close to the encoded entropy. To
tackle this entropy estimation problem, we randomly sample
a subset of Random Art images and count the number of
perceptually similar images in the subset, by which we
can statistically estimate the total number of perceptually
different images.
We use PerceptualDiff [15], a tool
that measures the
perceptual difference between two images, to help us iden-
tify perceptually similar images in an image set. Though
PerceptualDiff is not perfect — it may claim two different
(or similar) images are somewhat similar (or different),
it still provides a good starting point for our analysis.
We generate 3709 Random Art images and evaluate the
difference of each pair of images by PerceptualDiff. After
manually inspecting the 50 pairs with the least perceptual
differences, we found that 6 images are indeed very similar.
