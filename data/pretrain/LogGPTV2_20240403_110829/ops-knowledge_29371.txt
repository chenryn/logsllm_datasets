User: I am using python struct module to create custom binary files.
The file itself has the following format:
4 bytes (integer)
1 byte (unsigned char)
4 bytes (float) 
4 bytes (integer)
1 byte (unsigned char)
4 bytes (float) 
.......................... (100000 such lines)
4 bytes (integer)
1 byte (unsigned char)
4 bytes (float) 

Currently, I am using a 32bit machine to create these custom binary files. I am soon planning on switching to a 64bit machine.
Will I be able to read/write the same files using both {32bit / 64bit} machines? or should I expect compatibility issues?
(I will be using Ubuntu Linux for both)
Assistant: As long as your struct format string uses "standard size and alignment" (< or >) rather than "native size and alignment" (@), your files can be used cross-platform.
