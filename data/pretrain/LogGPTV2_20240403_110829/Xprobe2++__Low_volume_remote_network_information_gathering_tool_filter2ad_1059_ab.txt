# Identifying Potential Honeynet Systems and Network Fingerprinting with Xprobe2++

## Abstract
This paper introduces a remote network fingerprinting tool, Xprobe2++, that utilizes both network and application layer fingerprints to collect target system information. The collected data can be exported in XML format for use by information consumers, such as Intrusion Detection System (IDS) correlation engines. This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 covers the basics of network fingerprinting and the challenges faced by such tools. Section 3 details the architecture of Xprobe2++. Section 4 highlights the improvements made in Xprobe2++. Section 5 presents evaluation results, and Section 6 discusses potential issues. Finally, Section 7 concludes the work.

## 1. Introduction
Xprobe2++ is a novel active remote operating system fingerprinting tool that uses both network and application layer protocols to identify the type and version of the operating system running on a target system. By introducing application layer tests, Xprobe2++ aims to resolve problems that cannot be addressed through network layer fingerprinting alone.

## 2. Preliminaries

### 2.1. Network Scanning
Network scanning involves sending one or more packets to a host or network and inferring the presence of the host or network based on the received response (or lack thereof). 

### 2.2. Remote Operating System Fingerprinting
Remote Operating System Fingerprinting identifies the characteristics of the software running on a remote computer system, such as the operating system type, version, patch level, and installed software. This can be achieved by analyzing network traffic to and from the remote system or by sending requests and analyzing the responses.

### 2.3. Modern Fingerprinting Problems
Honeypots, modified TCP/IP stack settings, and network packet scrubbers often confuse remote fingerprinting tools. Xprobe2++ addresses these issues using fuzzy matching and mixed signatures that probe the target system at different layers of the OSI model.

## 3. Tool Architecture Overview

### 3.1. Core Components
- **Core Engine**: Manages basic data, signature management, module selection, loading, and probe execution.
- **Signature Matcher**: Analyzes results.
- **Plugins**: Provide packet probes and methods for analyzing and matching responses.

### 3.2. Module Groups
- **Network Discovery Modules**: Perform host probing, firewall detection, and provide information for automatic receive-timeout calculation.
- **Service Mapping Modules**: Map services and their versions.
- **Operating System Fingerprinting Modules**: Use both network and application layer tests to determine the target's OS and architecture.
- **Information Collection Modules**: Gather additional information about the target.

### 3.3. Fuzzy Signature Matching Mechanism
Xprobe2++ stores OS stack fingerprints as signatures. Each signature contains data regarding issued tests and possible responses. The tool uses a "fuzzy" matching algorithm to handle failed tests and confused results, providing a best-effort match when no full signature match is found.

## 4. Tool Improvements

### 4.1. Application Layer Signatures
Xprobe2++ uses additional application layer tests to map different classes of operating systems. These methods are effective and harder to emulate, providing more accurate information. The tool also includes modules to detect honeypot systems by generating known-to-be-valid and invalid application requests and validating responses.

### 4.2. Optional TCP/UDP Port Scanning
The optional TCP/UDP port scanning module allows execution of TCP, UDP, and application layer tests. If not enabled, Xprobe2++ uses minimal information provided by command-line parameters and discovered during other tests.

## 5. Evaluations
We evaluated Xprobe2++ by executing scans against various network systems, including Linux and Windows hosts, routers, and networked printers. We also tested the tool against a web server protected by an OpenBSD packet filter. The results showed that Xprobe2++ can perform high-precision OS fingerprinting with low network overhead.

## 6. Discussions
Xprobe2++ provides high-performance, high-accuracy network scanning and discovery techniques. However, it has limitations, such as the need for the remote host to respond to some tests. Additionally, the tool does not perform network service fingerprinting, which can lead to incorrect test execution on non-standard ports.

## 7. Conclusion
Xprobe2++ demonstrates the capability of using application layer fingerprinting tests along with network layer fingerprinting to perform remote OS fingerprinting with higher precision and lower network overhead. It also shows that application layer tests can detect specific network configurations that cannot be identified by network layer fingerprinting alone.

## 8. Availability
Xprobe2++ is free software released under the GNU General Public License. The discussed version will be available at the project website: [http://xprobe.sourceforge.net](http://xprobe.sourceforge.net).
