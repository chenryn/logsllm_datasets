User: Please explain the difference between HTTP and HTTPS, and explain when you need to use HTTPS.
Assistant: Difference Between HTTP and HTTPS: HTTP is Hypertext Transfer Protocol, which is a standard communication protocol for transferring messages between web browsers and web servers. HTTP uses clear text to transmit data, so it is easy for hackers to eavesdrop and tamper with data. And HTTPS is a secure socket layer hypertext transfer protocol, which is based on public key encryption technology and digital certificates to ensure data transmission security, with higher security and confidentiality. HTTPS can prevent hackers from eavesdropping, tampering, forgery and other attacks, and it can also protect users' personal information and sensitive data. When you need to use HTTPS: 1. Privacy information related to users - when users are performing operations involving personal privacy information such as online shopping, online payment, account registration, and login, using HTTPS communication can better protect users' privacy. Privacy; 2. Important information involved in the website - when the website needs to transmit and process some important information, such as financial information, medical records, government data, etc., using HTTPS communication can improve the confidentiality and integrity of data transmission; 3 Whether the user trusts the website - HTTPS can establish a credible authentication mechanism for the website, avoid being counterfeited by malicious websites, and help users confirm whether the website they visit is credible.
