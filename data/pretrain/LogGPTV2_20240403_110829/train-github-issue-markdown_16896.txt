This commit implements a fully-automated development setup using Gitpod.io, an  
online IDE for GitLab, GitHub, and Bitbucket that enables Dev-Environments-As-
Code.  
This makes it easy for anyone to get a ready-to-code workspace for any branch,  
issue or pull request almost instantly with a single click.
Thanks for the help and efforts, please remove all api's and reset my accounts
and balance to zero (0). Since, I was bugged or hacked.
