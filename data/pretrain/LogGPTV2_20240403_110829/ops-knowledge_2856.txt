User: I dealt with a bug today that only appeared when I ran my program right after booting my computer.  The cold start exposed a race condition which triggered the bug.  I managed to fix it, but it took a long time because I had to reboot my machine several times to figure out what was going on.  Can anybody suggest better ways of debugging problems like this in the future?  Can I somehow quickly put the computer into a "just booted" state?
