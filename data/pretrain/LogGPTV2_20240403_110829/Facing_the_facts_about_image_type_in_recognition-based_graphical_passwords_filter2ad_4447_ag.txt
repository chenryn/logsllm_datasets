are preferably undertaken only after success has been reached
in a lab environment. A ﬁeld study allows researchers and
designers to observe how the system would operate in real-
life and more accurately judge its acceptability, suitability,
and usability. With usable authentication research involving
passwords, ﬁeld studies may provide data on what types of
passwords users really select when they need to use them
regularly, whether passwords are memorable, what unexpected
coping strategies arise, whether the scheme is usable on
computer systems with different conﬁgurations (e.g., screen
sizes), and whether circumstances such as interference from
multiple passwords or password use in environments where
shoulder-surﬁng is possible causes problems not apparent in
the lab. Real-world usage is of particular concern with security
systems because security is often a secondary task [131],
enabling (or hindering) access to the user’s primary goal. In
such cases, user behaviour may vary considerably compared
to when users are asked to complete the security tasks in the
lab, where it may be their primary focus.
Besides the risk of exposing user resources or information
if security vulnerabilities are present and exploited, the data
collected from ﬁeld studies may be affected by factors that
are not
to know, for
example, whether users are employing coping mechanisms
such as printing screen captures of passwords. Issues could be
explored during interviews or through post-task questionnaires,
immediately apparent. It

but researchers must already have a suspicion that particular
behaviours are occurring in order to investigate them. Users
may not necessarily realize that some behaviours are insecure
or worthy of mention unless speciﬁcally prompted.
C. Other types of studies
1) Web-based: Other types of user studies are gaining
popularity, for example, unsupervised web-based studies [55],
[59], [90], [132]. The advantages are that large numbers of
participants can be recruited, the participant pool is likely
more diverse than in most controlled studies, participants can
be prompted to complete tasks at several different
times,
and participant behaviour may be more natural than in a lab
setting. Web-based studies are often cheaper, easier, and faster
than traditional controlled studies. Challenges to consider
include: great care is needed in getting informed consent
from participants (e.g., through a signature or other means
of authentication as required by organizational ethics review
boards),
is nearly impossible to know if demographics
information collected is accurate,
to enforce
adherence to procedures, and the collected data may not reﬂect
real behaviour.
is difﬁcult

Web-based studies offer one measure of ecological validity,
by being held in the participants’ natural environment, as
opposed to in a controlled lab environment. Additional eco-
logical validity can be gained by integrating realistic tasks and
systems, rather than using fabricated tasks. For authentication,
studies that focus users on primary tasks other than the actual
authentication offer a higher degree of ecological validity than
those that simply ask users to log in.
2) Hybrid: In hybrid studies, researchers combine lab stud-
ies with tasks completed in participants’ regular environment,
gaining advantages of both an initial controlled environment
and increasing ecological validity in the subsequent tasks.
The tasks are usually ﬁctitious, but may be designed to
approximate realistic tasks. Instructions for follow-up activities
may be provided at the end of the initial lab session, or
may be sent through email at a later time. For example, in
authentication studies, participants may be prompted through
email to log in to web-based test systems at various intervals.
These passwords may not protect valuable or personal infor-
mation, but some ecological validity is gained by having users
enter their passwords from within their regular environments.
Furthermore, primary tasks can be assigned, such as asking
users to comment on a blog or to access subscription-based
material, where login with the authentication scheme is simply
part of the process.
X. FURTHER DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
Our tour of graphical password research to date has revealed
a rich palette of ideas, but few schemes that truly deliver on
the original promise of addressing the problems seen in text
passwords. Indeed, careful examination of the ﬁrst generation
of graphical password schemes indicates that many of the same
problems continue to re-surface.
In assessing usability, an apples-to-apples comparison re-
quires comparing schemes of equivalent security (Figure 10).
Fig. 10.
Usability should be compared with schemes of comparable security levels.
Abstraction (log-scale) for keeping relative security in context.
It is less meaningful to compare the usability of two schemes
offering vastly different security propositions, and if done,
this should be explicitly acknowledged. For example, most
recognition-based systems have theoretical password spaces
comparable to 4-digit PINs, while recall and cued-recall sys-
tems have theoretical password spaces more similar in size
to 8-character-or-more text passwords. Somewhat longer login
times may be acceptable for password-equivalent systems than
for PIN-equivalent systems, if they provide greater security
where it is needed.
Published research in the area of graphical passwords
currently lacks consistency, making it difﬁcult to compare
or reproduce results. Where reasonable, researchers should
choose methods and measures that allow for comparison with
other work. Moreover, research proposals and analyses for
new systems should include: speciﬁc motivation for the work,
a description of the system’s design including any special
instrumentation for prototyping and testing versions, a clear
description of the study methodology, analysis that explains
which usability and security aspects are being tested, aside
from main results. While early work is often by deﬁnition
incomplete, a comprehensive evaluation should acknowledge
the above points and identify foreseeable issues, even if a full
evaluation has not yet been conducted.
Many proposed graphical password systems lack rigorous
evaluation in security or usability (or both). A closer look at
individual systems has typically revealed less security than
promised, matching historical experience in other areas. Sig-
niﬁcant security ﬂaws have been found in all three canonical
examples (original versions) discussed in this paper. These and
other proposed systems suffer from either small theoretical
password spaces (if the system is conﬁgured to be usable) or
patterns in user choice that reduce the size of the effective
password space. New designs should focus on increasing
entropy without sacriﬁcing usability and memorability.
In many systems having poor security, users appear to
have compromised security in favour of memorability. The
exploitable patterns evident in PassFaces, DAS, and PassPoints
passwords result from users trying to select memorable pass-
words, which in turn increases predictability and facilitates
password guessing. A challenge for designers is to identify
memory aids for legitimate users, that cannot be leveraged by
attackers to guess passwords. Furthermore, systems allowing
some degree of user choice should encourage randomization
of user-chosen sequences as well as individual items, to avoid
divide and conquer guessing attacks. It remains an open ques-
tion whether systems can be designed such that user choice
does not signiﬁcantly weaken security, or whether a successful
combination of system suggestion and user choice can be

for usable security is to increase both usability and security simultaneously.
devised. A complementary method for addressing predictable
passwords is the use of so-called “strong” password protocols
(e.g., SRP [99], EKE [98]) designed to provide protection
against ofﬂine dictionary attacks.
For usability, a major concern is multiple password inter-
ference. Since graphical passwords are not widely deployed, it
is unknown whether we will simply mirror the problems with
text passwords where users develop coping strategies, devise
and reuse common patterns, and choose minimally secure
passwords. The visual cues provided by graphical passwords
along with the potential of human memory processing for
images offer reason for optimism, but further research is
required to conﬁrm that these can be translated into schemes
with increased security and usability, in a realistic setting.
Security and usability have historically been viewed as items
to be traded off, representing opposite ends of a spectrum:
increasing one necessarily decreases the other. Most prod-
ucts and mechanisms to date, including for many graphical
password schemes, afford only ﬁxed levers such that, for
example, adding extra rounds to PassFaces increases security
but at the cost of an additional memorability burden since
each additional round also exposes users to a new set of
decoys. As illustrated in Figure 11, the challenge for the
second generation of graphical password schemes, and in the
design for usable security in general, is instead to ﬁnd new
designs and architectures which afford increases in security
and usability together.
