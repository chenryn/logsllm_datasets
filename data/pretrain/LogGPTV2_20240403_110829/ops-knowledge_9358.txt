User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Plesk 11 named.conf Failed I am using PSA for my web and mail hosting with CentOS.

When I reboot the server and when I start PSA, it says an error occurred: service named failed.

I did a little research and the named.conf file doesn't exist anywhere on my servers. I can't download bind because Plesk already downloaded it and I can't run bind too.

My error log

isathens one domain

Assistant: From your log I would conclude that multiple zone files were accidentally removed or corrupted for unknown reason. Try running /usr/local/psa/admin/sbin/dnsmng --update domain.com for each domain you host - it should regenerate zone files. I am not sure it will fix all problems as I cannot tell size of damage.

P.S.
Just for reference - Plesk runs exactly the same Bind as shipped by your OS vendor.
