Question: "A developer is tasked with managing SELinux policy files for an Android device. The developer must decide where to install mapping files for the system_ext and product partitions to ensure compatibility and ease of maintenance. What are the advantages of placing a CIL file containing the mapping information in `{SYSTEM_EXT_PRIVATE_SEPOLICY_DIRS}/compat/{ver}/{ver}.cil` and `{PRODUCT_PRIVATE_SEPOLICY_DIRS}/compat/{ver}/{ver}.cil`, and adding them to `PRODUCT_PACKAGES`?"
 "A": "It guarantees automatic compatibility with future platform versions without any additional intervention."
 "B": "It allows partners to maintain compatibility by providing their own versioned attributes for policy files."
 "C": "It ensures that the vendor partition will automatically export the designated public types without the need for mapping files."
 "D": "It prevents any future changes in the public sepolicy, ensuring that the private policy remains unchanged."
Answer: B
