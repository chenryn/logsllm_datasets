User: I need to find a stable wsgi server that won't stop processing requests when client disconnect.
I'm not sure if uWSGI or gunicorn would fit this criteria.

Forgot to add this:
I am also trying to return a response before the request gets processed.

Any ideas?
Assistant: almost all wsgi servers do that. I'm not sure what you mean.

gunicorn
paste
cherrypy
twisted.web
apache with mod_wsgi 
werkzeug
...
