I am looking for a stable WSGI server that can continue processing requests even if the client disconnects. I am unsure whether uWSGI or Gunicorn would meet this requirement.

Additionally, I need to return a response to the client before the request is fully processed. 

Could you provide some guidance on which WSGI servers support these criteria?

Response:
Most WSGI servers are designed to handle client disconnections gracefully and will continue processing requests. However, returning a response before the request is fully processed is a bit more complex and may require additional configuration or middleware.

Here are some WSGI servers that you might consider:

- **Gunicorn**: A popular choice, known for its stability and performance.
- **uWSGI**: Highly configurable and feature-rich, with support for various deployment scenarios.
- **Paste**: A pluggable WSGI server and middleware framework.
- **CherryPy**: A minimalist web framework that includes a built-in WSGI server.
- **Twisted.web**: Part of the Twisted networking library, it provides a WSGI server.
- **Apache with mod_wsgi**: Integrates well with Apache and is suitable for high-traffic applications.
- **Werkzeug**: A WSGI utility library that includes a simple development server.

For the specific requirement of returning a response before the request is fully processed, you might need to implement custom middleware or use asynchronous features provided by some of these servers. For example, Gunicorn with an asynchronous worker class (like `gevent` or `uvicorn`) or Twisted.web could be suitable for such use cases.

If you have any further details about your application, I can provide more tailored advice.
