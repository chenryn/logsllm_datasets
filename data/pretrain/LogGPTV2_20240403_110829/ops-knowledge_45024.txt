User: In a cloud computing environment, how to manage and schedule a large number of virtual machine instances? Please introduce a common cloud computing management tool or platform, and explain its main functions and usage methods.
Assistant: A common cloud computing management tool is OpenStack, which is an open source cloud computing platform that can be used to manage and schedule a large number of virtual machine instances. The main functions of OpenStack include virtual machine management, network management, storage management, identity authentication and authorization, cluster management, etc. It can be managed and operated through the web console, command line tools and API. To use OpenStack, you first need to install and configure the OpenStack environment, and then use the web console or command line tools to create virtual machine instances, configure network, storage and security policies, etc., and monitor and manage the running status and resource usage of virtual machine instances . OpenStack can also be integrated with other cloud computing management tools and platforms, such as Kubernetes, Docker, etc., to provide more powerful and flexible cloud computing services.
