observed n-gram cases. We note that the model based on
discretization into two length and ten angle regions (2x10)
may perform better in terms of crack rate when gestures in a
set are relatively simple.
Partial guessing entropy results from the three optimized
models, converted to “bits of information” are shown in
Table IV. The results of two additional data sets are included:
4-digit PINs [2], and screen lock patterns [14]. The results
indicate that gestures, across all three n-gram models, poten-
tially have higher entropy estimates compared to PINs and
patterns at different α levels. Although our n-gram models can
be further optimized in the future (to more accurately estimate
the probabilities of real-world gesture passwords), these early
comparisons provide some evidence that guessing gestures
might be more challenging compared to PINs or patterns. We
note the models show a steep rise in partial guessing entropy
levels between α values of 0.1 and 0.4. This likely reﬂects the
“weak subspace” of gestures [11] – the idea that a subset of
user created gestures (at low α levels) take simple forms that
are relatively easy to guess, while the remainder (encountered
at higher α levels) are more challenging.
H. Security Results: Clustering-based Dictionary Attack
We then applied methods from the third stage of our
framework: performing clustering-based dictionary attacks on
the collected gestures and measuring cracked rates. Following
the processes outlined in Section III-E, we generated clusters,
dictionaries and attack data for DTW and Protractor recogniz-
ers. We report data for the full gesture sets. Dictionaries are
shown in Figure 4. Protractor led to a total of 325 clusters
with a mean (inverse) inter-cluster distance of 4.69 for the
top 20 dictionary clusters. DTW resulted in a total of 290
clusters and a mean inter-cluster distance of 8.97 for the top
20 dictionary clusters. These thresholds are substantially more
permissive than EERs thresholds, indicating that, in general,
gestures in each cluster would be matched with each other
if EER thresholds are used as a criteria. This suggests the
clustering algorithm was effective at grouping similar gestures.
Fig. 5. Proportion of cracked gestures with dictionaries at FRRs from 0%-
15% with Protractor and DTW recognizers in the ﬁrst study. Vertical lines
show EER values for each recognizer.
As we are primarily interested in online attack on mobile
phone unlock screens, we used dictionaries generated from
training sets to guess gesture passwords when k = 20, the
default number of guesses before an Android device locks
out further attempts. The results, for both dictionaries and
recognizers, are shown in Figure 5. At thresholds correspond-
ing to EER values, the dictionaries are highly effective. They
crack between 54.18% (DTW) and 58.37% (Protractor) of
gestures. In general, fewer gestures are guessed with DTW
than Protractor, suggesting that future gesture authentication
systems should use DTW in preference. More generally, this
data also highlights that data-set wide EERs may overestimate
the security of gesture passwords – stricter thresholds need
be applied to create a viable system. The limited data on
thresholds used in prior work conﬁrms this – a threshold of 2.0
with Protractor has been previously proposed [10]. In our data
set, increasing the Protractor threshold to 2.0 corresponds to
an FRR for genuine users of 11.54%, which would reduce the
effectiveness of the clustering-based dictionary attack against
Protractor from 58.37% to 31.49%. Applying a threshold
corresponding to the same 11.54% FRR to DTW drops the
performance of clustering attack from 54.18% to 23.13%.
For comparison, dictionary attacks performed on patterns
achieve between 13.33% crack rate in a real-world mobile
application [28], and 32.55% in an MTurk study [14] and real-
world pattern lock error rates, FRRs, are 12.1% [27].
We note our dictionary attacks are more effective than the
ofﬂine guessing attack reported in Liu et al. [11] – they crack
a comparable 55.9% of gestures using DTW but required
109 guesses. There are a number of reasons for this: the
gestures generated in more controlled settings may be more
complex, distinct and consistent [29] than those generated by
MTurk workers online (though which group generates content
more representative of genuine password gestures is an open
question), and the gestures used in the current work are inten-
tionally constrained to be simple single strokes in the small,

practical “screen-lock” region of smartphones rather than the
multi-stroke full-screen gestures that have been previously
studied [5]. However, the strength of the dictionaries likely
reﬂects the presence of a “weak subspace” [11] of gesture
passwords – a large subset of the gestures users create are
insecure due to, for example,
their similarity to common
reference points such as letters, their simplicity or the tendency
for other users to create highly similar strokes. We identify the
lack of diversity in users’ gestures revealed by this analysis
as a major problem undermining the potential of gesture
passwords as a smartphone lock scheme.
V. SECOND STUDY: GESTURE SELECTION POLICIES
To increase the entropy of gesture passwords, we conducted
a second study exploring the impact of four policy conditions:
a standard baseline condition, similar to that used in the
ﬁrst study; a novel lexical policy in which participants were
provided with words that could inspire their gestures; a novel
blacklist policy that prevents users from creating pass-gestures
matching those in a displayed dictionary and; a consolidated
blacklist policy with a reﬁned set of blocked gestures. The
lexical, blacklist and consolidated policies were intended to
increase the entropy of the gestures participants generate by,
respectively, inspiring users to create more diverse forms and
restricting the use of dictionary items. We apply our security
assessment framework to data from this study to determine if
resistance to dictionary based attacks is improved; this work
also serves to further validate our framework. We also report
on usability outcomes from the policies over two recall study
sessions. The ethical aspects of the study were IRB approved.
A. Blacklist Policy Design
For the blacklist policy we created a dictionary consisting
of the representative gestures from the largest 20 clusters
of pass-gestures in the ﬁrst study. We presented them to
participants and informed them they could not use these
gestures as their pass-gesture. We enforced this by testing
creation pass-gestures against the dictionary and generating
a policy violation error message if there was a match; this
policy explicitly checked for compliance. The dictionary is
only shown during the pass-gesture creation phase.
B. Consolidated Policy Design
The consolidated policy design used the full set of clusters
from the ﬁrst study. We ordered the clusters by size and
extracted the central representative gestures. We then traversed
the ordered list to create a consolidated set of clusters by
matching each subsequent gesture against the set of those
already examined (using Protractor and the ﬁrst study EER
value of 1.25). In the case of a match, the list cluster was
merged with the one in the consolidated set. If there was no
match, the list cluster was added to the set. After examining all
original clusters, we produced a consolidated dictionary from
the 20 largest clusters in the consolidated set. This process
aimed to produce a dictionary with minimal replication by
merging small clusters of similar gestures to create a more
representative set of ﬁnal clusters and gestures. Beyond these
differences in dictionary generation, the consolidated policy
was identical to the blacklist policy in how it was presented.
C. Lexical Policy Design
The lexical policy displayed words, which users can update,
during pass-gesture creation and indicated participants can
use these terms to inspire their gestures. The words are
shown only during the initial gesture creation and not stored
with the gesture templates or intended to serve as mnemonic
cues or “gesture hints.” The policy resembles prior gesture
password policies [21] in some ways: it is not enforceable
and seeks to provide open-ended guidance for creating diverse
or unique gestures. It differs by presenting semantic content
rather than guidance or advice. For this policy we constructed
a dictionary of sixty English words starting from a combined
set of 3000 monosyllabic [30] and 3000 disyllabic [31] words
rated for imageability, a construct which captures how easily
a given word elicits or evokes a mental image or picture
of what it refers to. While this clearly relates to the idea
that words may inspire gestures, the relationship is hard to
predict. High imageability words might lead to a large number
of similar gestures (e.g., all gestures for “ice-cream” might
be frosty cones), while low imageability words might have
more diversity, as users think of different things, or might
poorly support the task by failing to inspire gestures at all.
Consequently, our dictionary was built from a spread of words:
20 words from the top end of the imageability scale, 20 words
from the center of the scale and 20 words from the bottom
of the scale. We also ﬁltered words by further criteria to
ensure they avoided extremes of affect [35] and were widely
known [34], [33]; see Table V for full details.
D. User Study Design
This study was largely similar to ﬁrst study; it used MTurk,
ran on a website, required completion on a mobile device and
used the same Protractor gesture recognizer. In addition to the
introduction of the four policy conditions, there were a number
of differences: Protractor was adjusted to reﬂect the ﬁrst study
EERs with an elevated match threshold of 1.25 – we kept this
low threshold to maintain our ability to capture the broadest
range of possible gestures; we introduced a gesture practice
phase, common in similar studies [36]; we replaced the attack
gesture task, due to its impact on recall rates, with a typical

feedback that was identical to the ﬁrst study. Those participants
who successfully recalled their gestures within ﬁve attempts
were invited back to a second recall session. This was achieved
via the bonus feature of MTurk that allows the owners of a
task to send an email and provide an additional payment to
workers who complete their task. The email was sent 24 hours
after completion of the study and included a link and a QR
code for the recall study. The follow up task was a single
recall test, identical in structure to the initial recall test. The
link expired after 48 hours of receiving the invite.
E. Measures
We measured all data captured in the ﬁrst study. In addition,
we logged the number of practice gestures participants cor-
rectly matched against their creation or conﬁrmation templates
and a new set of recall data for participants who completed the
second session. For participants in the blacklist and consoli-
dated policies we additionally logged the number of times they
matched the dictionary gestures during pass-gesture creation
while in the lexical policy we logged the lexical cue displayed
when they created their gesture, and the number of times they
changed this cue.
F. Usability Results
1) Demographics: In total, 4000 unique US based MTurk
workers completed the study: 1000/policy. They were predom-
inantly white (65.1%), black or African American (11.4%),
Hispanic (9.7%) or Asian (7.8%) and 18-24 (23.5%), 25-34
(48.6%) or 35-44 (19.5%) years old. Education level (post-
graduate (11.7%), college (49.2%), high school level (37%))
and profession were diverse; 11% were students. Participants
completed the study tasks on the ﬁrst day (from the start of
gesture creation until the ﬁnal gesture recall) in a median of
132 seconds, and the gesture password recall task (equivalent
to the recall time measure, see section IV-C) on the second
day in a median of 4 seconds; the hourly compensation rates
were 27 USD per hour and 450 USD per hour respectively.
2) Setup, Participation and Recall: Usability measures are
summarized in Table VI while participation and recall rates
are in Table VII. For the majority of measures, the data was
homogeneous and exhibited strong positive skews; accordingly
we applied non-parametric testing. Kruskal-Wallis tests on
Setup Time (χ2 = 1076.5, p < 0.001), Day 1 Recall
Time (χ2 = 133.15, p < 0.001) and Day 2 Recall Time
(χ2 = 34.525, p < 0.001) revealed signiﬁcant differences.
Bonferroni corrected post-hoc Wilcoxon tests on these mea-
sures revealed the following comparisons to be signiﬁcant: all
differences in Setup Time (at p < 0.001); all bar between
baseline and lexical in Day 1 Recall Time (at p < 0.003) and;
between baseline-blacklist, baseline-consolidated and lexical-
consolidated in Day 2 Recall Time (at p < 0.003). Recall
Attempts did not vary on day 1 (χ2(2) = 5.66, p = 0.129)
or day 2 (χ2(2) = 4.43, p = 0.22). Bonferroni corrected
Chi-squared tests of independence revealed the following
differences in participation and recall rates: the consolidated

memory game distracter task and; there was a follow-up recall
session 24-72 hours after the initial session – a recall period
similar to that used in prior work [14] to reﬂect real-world
smart phone unlocking frequencies. For this more involved
study, participants received 1 USD for completion of the ﬁrst
session and 0.5 USD for completion of the second session.
Details of the study structure are described below; for brevity,
we omit details that replicate those in the ﬁrst study.
Study instructions were similar to the ﬁrst study – they were
modiﬁed to reﬂect the revised study structure and included
a brief description of the policy; each participant completed
only one policy condition. Although participants did not create
attack-gestures, we retained this section of the instructions to
motivate participants to create stronger gesture passwords. In
the baseline policy condition, creation and conﬁrmation of the
pass-gesture proceeded identically to the ﬁrst study. In the
blacklist and consolidated policy conditions, participants were
shown the gesture dictionary on the password creation screen
and informed they cannot use these gestures; all creation pass-
gestures were tested against the dictionary. If there was a
match, participants received a policy error message and needed
to restart
the pass-gesture creation process. In the lexical
policy condition, the creation screen prominently displayed a
word, the instruction to use this word to inspire their gesture,
and the ability to change this word to another one. The ﬁrst
presented word was determined by the participant ID number
(from the database logging the study results) in order to more
evenly balance initial word presentation. Changed words were
delivered in a random order. Participants were able to change
the word multiple times. Figure 6 shows all policy interfaces.
After conﬁrming their pass-gestures, participants practiced
them 10 times. Gestures during practice were matched against
creation and conﬁrmation gestures and feedback as to whether
they matched was provided to users after each gesture entry.
Success was not mandated. Following prior study designs [14],
we then had participants complete a distracter task to wipe
their short term memory: they played a color matching game
in which they ﬂipped over pairs of cards looking for similar
colors. The study session ﬁnished with a recall task and closing

curves. In general, the lexical condition shows poor perfor-
mance: EERs are elevated compared to baseline. The blacklist
and consolidated conditions show more promise: EER rates are
similar (Protractor) or improved (DTW) over baseline. At the
same time, thresholds become more permissive. These trends
suggest that the blacklist and consolidated policies collected
a more diverse set of gestures – EER thresholds are more
permissive due to greater variance in the strokes generated.
H. Security Results: Entropy Analysis
As the second analysis, we generated n-gram models for
each policy using the well balanced 3x10 model conﬁguration
from the ﬁrst study. Appendix E shows the stroke distribution
for each policy in Figure 11. We then calculated partial
guessing entropy. The results are shown in Table IX. All
three of the policies introduced in this paper equal or exceed
the baseline policy at most α levels. However, there is some
discrepancy between the policies as α increases. Speciﬁcally,
at the low α levels more relevant to an online attack with
a small number of guesses, the blacklist and consolidated
policies show elevated partial guessing entropy. In contrast,
the lexical policy shows a reduction in partial guessing entropy
compared to baseline at low α levels while, at higher levels
of α, it achieves peak results. We suggest these variations
may be due to compliance rates with the lexical policy: the
minority of users who engaged more strongly with the lexical
cue may have created highly unique and complex gestures,
making it more difﬁcult for an attacker to guess the full
set. In contrast, the enforced compliance with the blacklist
and consolidated policies ensured that all users needed to
create gestures reﬂecting the policy constraints, resulting in
a reduction in the size of the “weak subspace” of easily
