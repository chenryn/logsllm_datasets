### Comparison of Partial Guessing Entropy ("Bits of Information") with Cracking Fraction (α) Across Password Data Sets

**Table IV: Partial Guessing Entropy Results**

| Dataset                | α = 0.1 | α = 0.2 | α = 0.3 | α = 0.4 | α = 0.7 | α = 1.0 |
|------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 2x10 Pass-gestures     | 6.29    | 8.39    | 11.39   | 13.31   | 16.11   | 17.98   |
| 3x10 Pass-gestures     | 6.97    | 9.69    | 13.26   | 15.41   | 18.57   | 20.68   |
| 4x12 Pass-gestures     | 7.47    | 11.27   | 15.94   | 18.40   | 21.68   | 23.98   |
| 4-digit PINs [2]       | 5.19    | 7.04    | 8.37    | 9.38    | 11.08   | 11.83   |
| Patterns [14]          | 5.04    | 5.82    | 6.54    | 7.19    | 9.20    | 12.71   |

The results indicate that gestures, across all three n-gram models, potentially have higher entropy estimates compared to PINs and patterns at different α levels. Although our n-gram models can be further optimized in the future (to more accurately estimate the probabilities of real-world gesture passwords), these early comparisons provide some evidence that guessing gestures might be more challenging compared to PINs or patterns. The models show a steep rise in partial guessing entropy levels between α values of 0.1 and 0.4, likely reflecting the "weak subspace" of gestures—simple forms that are relatively easy to guess at low α levels, while the remainder are more challenging.

### Security Results: Clustering-Based Dictionary Attack

We then applied methods from the third stage of our framework: performing clustering-based dictionary attacks on the collected gestures and measuring cracked rates. Following the processes outlined in Section III-E, we generated clusters, dictionaries, and attack data for DTW and Protractor recognizers. We report data for the full gesture sets. Dictionaries are shown in Figure 4. Protractor led to a total of 325 clusters with a mean (inverse) inter-cluster distance of 4.69 for the top 20 dictionary clusters. DTW resulted in a total of 290 clusters and a mean inter-cluster distance of 8.97 for the top 20 dictionary clusters. These thresholds are substantially more permissive than EER thresholds, indicating that, in general, gestures in each cluster would be matched with each other if EER thresholds are used as criteria. This suggests the clustering algorithm was effective at grouping similar gestures.

**Figure 5: Proportion of Cracked Gestures with Dictionaries at FRRs from 0%-15% with Protractor and DTW Recognizers in the First Study. Vertical Lines Show EER Values for Each Recognizer.**

As we are primarily interested in online attacks on mobile phone unlock screens, we used dictionaries generated from training sets to guess gesture passwords when k = 20, the default number of guesses before an Android device locks out further attempts. The results, for both dictionaries and recognizers, are shown in Figure 5. At thresholds corresponding to EER values, the dictionaries are highly effective, cracking between 54.18% (DTW) and 58.37% (Protractor) of gestures. In general, fewer gestures are guessed with DTW than Protractor, suggesting that future gesture authentication systems should use DTW in preference. More generally, this data also highlights that data-set wide EERs may overestimate the security of gesture passwords—stricter thresholds need to be applied to create a viable system. The limited data on thresholds used in prior work confirms this—a threshold of 2.0 with Protractor has been previously proposed [10]. In our dataset, increasing the Protractor threshold to 2.0 corresponds to an FRR for genuine users of 11.54%, which would reduce the effectiveness of the clustering-based dictionary attack against Protractor from 58.37% to 31.49%. Applying a threshold corresponding to the same 11.54% FRR to DTW drops the performance of clustering attack from 54.18% to 23.13%.

For comparison, dictionary attacks performed on patterns achieve between 13.33% crack rate in a real-world mobile application [28], and 32.55% in an MTurk study [14], and real-world pattern lock error rates, FRRs, are 12.1% [27].

We note our dictionary attacks are more effective than the offline guessing attack reported in Liu et al. [11]—they crack a comparable 55.9% of gestures using DTW but required 109 guesses. There are several reasons for this: the gestures generated in more controlled settings may be more complex, distinct, and consistent [29] than those generated by MTurk workers online (though which group generates content more representative of genuine password gestures is an open question). The gestures used in the current work are intentionally constrained to be simple single strokes in the small, practical "screen-lock" region of smartphones rather than the multi-stroke full-screen gestures that have been previously studied [5]. However, the strength of the dictionaries likely reflects the presence of a "weak subspace" [11] of gesture passwords—a large subset of the gestures users create are insecure due to, for example, their similarity to common reference points such as letters, their simplicity, or the tendency for other users to create highly similar strokes. We identify the lack of diversity in users' gestures revealed by this analysis as a major problem undermining the potential of gesture passwords as a smartphone lock scheme.

### Second Study: Gesture Selection Policies

To increase the entropy of gesture passwords, we conducted a second study exploring the impact of four policy conditions: a standard baseline condition, similar to that used in the first study; a novel lexical policy in which participants were provided with words that could inspire their gestures; a novel blacklist policy that prevents users from creating pass-gestures matching those in a displayed dictionary; and a consolidated blacklist policy with a refined set of blocked gestures. The lexical, blacklist, and consolidated policies were intended to increase the entropy of the gestures participants generate by, respectively, inspiring users to create more diverse forms and restricting the use of dictionary items. We apply our security assessment framework to data from this study to determine if resistance to dictionary-based attacks is improved; this work also serves to further validate our framework. We also report on usability outcomes from the policies over two recall study sessions. The ethical aspects of the study were IRB approved.

#### A. Blacklist Policy Design

For the blacklist policy, we created a dictionary consisting of the representative gestures from the largest 20 clusters of pass-gestures in the first study. We presented them to participants and informed them they could not use these gestures as their pass-gesture. We enforced this by testing creation pass-gestures against the dictionary and generating a policy violation error message if there was a match. This policy explicitly checked for compliance. The dictionary is only shown during the pass-gesture creation phase.

#### B. Consolidated Policy Design

The consolidated policy design used the full set of clusters from the first study. We ordered the clusters by size and extracted the central representative gestures. We then traversed the ordered list to create a consolidated set of clusters by matching each subsequent gesture against the set of those already examined (using Protractor and the first study EER value of 1.25). In the case of a match, the list cluster was merged with the one in the consolidated set. If there was no match, the list cluster was added to the set. After examining all original clusters, we produced a consolidated dictionary from the 20 largest clusters in the consolidated set. This process aimed to produce a dictionary with minimal replication by merging small clusters of similar gestures to create a more representative set of final clusters and gestures. Beyond these differences in dictionary generation, the consolidated policy was identical to the blacklist policy in how it was presented.

#### C. Lexical Policy Design

The lexical policy displayed words, which users can update, during pass-gesture creation and indicated participants can use these terms to inspire their gestures. The words are shown only during the initial gesture creation and not stored with the gesture templates or intended to serve as mnemonic cues or "gesture hints." The policy resembles prior gesture password policies [21] in some ways: it is not enforceable and seeks to provide open-ended guidance for creating diverse or unique gestures. It differs by presenting semantic content rather than guidance or advice. For this policy, we constructed a dictionary of sixty English words starting from a combined set of 3000 monosyllabic [30] and 3000 disyllabic [31] words rated for imageability, a construct which captures how easily a given word elicits or evokes a mental image or picture of what it refers to. While this clearly relates to the idea that words may inspire gestures, the relationship is hard to predict. High imageability words might lead to a large number of similar gestures (e.g., all gestures for "ice-cream" might be frosty cones), while low imageability words might have more diversity, as users think of different things, or might poorly support the task by failing to inspire gestures at all. Consequently, our dictionary was built from a spread of words: 20 words from the top end of the imageability scale, 20 words from the center of the scale, and 20 words from the bottom of the scale. We also filtered words by further criteria to ensure they avoided extremes of affect [35] and were widely known [34], [33]; see Table V for full details.

#### D. User Study Design

This study was largely similar to the first study; it used MTurk, ran on a website, required completion on a mobile device, and used the same Protractor gesture recognizer. In addition to the introduction of the four policy conditions, there were several differences: Protractor was adjusted to reflect the first study EERs with an elevated match threshold of 1.25—we kept this low threshold to maintain our ability to capture the broadest range of possible gestures. We introduced a gesture practice phase, common in similar studies [36], and replaced the attack gesture task, due to its impact on recall rates, with a typical feedback that was identical to the first study. Those participants who successfully recalled their gestures within five attempts were invited back to a second recall session. This was achieved via the bonus feature of MTurk that allows the owners of a task to send an email and provide an additional payment to workers who complete their task. The email was sent 24 hours after completion of the study and included a link and a QR code for the recall study. The follow-up task was a single recall test, identical in structure to the initial recall test. The link expired after 48 hours of receiving the invite.

#### E. Measures

We measured all data captured in the first study. In addition, we logged the number of practice gestures participants correctly matched against their creation or confirmation templates and a new set of recall data for participants who completed the second session. For participants in the blacklist and consolidated policies, we additionally logged the number of times they matched the dictionary gestures during pass-gesture creation. In the lexical policy, we logged the lexical cue displayed when they created their gesture and the number of times they changed this cue.

#### F. Usability Results

1. **Demographics**: In total, 4000 unique US-based MTurk workers completed the study: 1000/policy. They were predominantly white (65.1%), black or African American (11.4%), Hispanic (9.7%), or Asian (7.8%) and 18-24 (23.5%), 25-34 (48.6%), or 35-44 (19.5%) years old. Education level (post-graduate (11.7%), college (49.2%), high school level (37%)) and profession were diverse; 11% were students. Participants completed the study tasks on the first day (from the start of gesture creation until the final gesture recall) in a median of 132 seconds, and the gesture password recall task (equivalent to the recall time measure, see section IV-C) on the second day in a median of 4 seconds; the hourly compensation rates were 27 USD per hour and 450 USD per hour, respectively.

2. **Setup, Participation, and Recall**: Usability measures are summarized in Table VI, while participation and recall rates are in Table VII. For the majority of measures, the data was homogeneous and exhibited strong positive skews; accordingly, we applied non-parametric testing. Kruskal-Wallis tests on Setup Time (χ2 = 1076.5, p < 0.001), Day 1 Recall Time (χ2 = 133.15, p < 0.001), and Day 2 Recall Time (χ2 = 34.525, p < 0.001) revealed significant differences. Bonferroni corrected post-hoc Wilcoxon tests on these measures revealed the following comparisons to be significant: all differences in Setup Time (at p < 0.001); all bar between baseline and lexical in Day 1 Recall Time (at p < 0.003); and between baseline-blacklist, baseline-consolidated, and lexical-consolidated in Day 2 Recall Time (at p < 0.003). Recall Attempts did not vary on day 1 (χ2(2) = 5.66, p = 0.129) or day 2 (χ2(2) = 4.43, p = 0.22). Bonferroni corrected Chi-squared tests of independence revealed the following differences in participation and recall rates: the consolidated condition recorded reduced Day 1 Recall Rate compared to (a) Blacklist, (b) Consolidated, and (c) Lexical.

### Security Results: Entropy Analysis

As the second analysis, we generated n-gram models for each policy using the well-balanced 3x10 model configuration from the first study. Appendix E shows the stroke distribution for each policy in Figure 11. We then calculated partial guessing entropy. The results are shown in Table IX. All three of the policies introduced in this paper equal or exceed the baseline policy at most α levels. However, there is some discrepancy between the policies as α increases. Specifically, at the low α levels more relevant to an online attack with a small number of guesses, the blacklist and consolidated policies show elevated partial guessing entropy. In contrast, the lexical policy shows a reduction in partial guessing entropy compared to baseline at low α levels, while at higher levels of α, it achieves peak results. We suggest these variations may be due to compliance rates with the lexical policy: the minority of users who engaged more strongly with the lexical cue may have created highly unique and complex gestures, making it more difficult for an attacker to guess the full set. In contrast, the enforced compliance with the blacklist and consolidated policies ensured that all users needed to create gestures reflecting the policy constraints, resulting in a reduction in the size of the "weak subspace" of easily guessable gestures.
