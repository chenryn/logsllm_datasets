Use container technology to package the application as a mirror, and use container orchestration tools for deployment, such as Docker, Kubernetes, etc. 3. Use configuration management tools to manage and automate the deployment of the deployment environment, such as Ansible, Chef, Puppet, etc. 4. Use CI/CD tools to achieve continuous integration and automated deployment, such as Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, etc.
