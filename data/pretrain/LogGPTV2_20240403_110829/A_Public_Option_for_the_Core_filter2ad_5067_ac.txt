[52]. The budgeting and operation of NBN is regulated by law, and
legislation also protects it from other ISPs undercutting its prices by
cherry-picking low-cost markets [51]. In addition, many of the IXPs
in Europe and elsewhere (but less so in the US) are nonprofits, and
some require open peering between all connected networks. While
these developments have some superficial similarity to our proposed
POC, and are additional evidence that nonprofit and governmental
networks can successfully carry commercial traffic, their limited
geographic scope prevents them from having any significant impact
on the broader structure of the Internet (and, to be clear, such impact
was never their intent).
More academically, the notion of a “public option” has been
previously raised in the research literature by Ma and Misra [39].
Despite the similarity of terminology, their paper addresses a very
different problem than we do. First, they do not propose any changes
to the core, only the last mile (what we call LMPs). Second, and far
more fundamentally, they focus on service differentiation between
content providers, not termination fees. They find that the presence
of a nonprofit LMP that does not discriminate creates competitive
pressure on commercial LMPs to not discriminate. However, note
that the impact of service discrimination is visible to users, who then
abandon LMPs that give worse service. In contrast, termination fees
are invisible to users, and only reduce the profit margin of CSPs.
Thus, their results would not apply to the problem we consider here.
3 Designing the Public Option for the Core
In this section we describe the overall design of the POC. We
do not describe any of the low-level technical details of running a
backbone network, as we assume that the POC uses industry best-
practices for this. Instead, we address four basic questions on four
different topics of concern:
Network Services: What network services does the POC provide?
Payment Structure: Who pays who for what?
Bandwidth Auction: How are Bandwidth Providers compensated
by the POC?
Peering: What are the peering arrangements between the LMPs that
are attached to the POC?
3.1 Network Services
At a minimum, the POC provides point-to-point connectivity
between all connected LMPs and to the external ISPs to which the
POC is connected. The POC can offer additional services; while
these are not the main point of this paper, we do want to discuss
some possible offerings. The first is offering different levels of
quality-of-service (QoS). Some definitions of network neutrality
disallow any QoS mechanisms on the basis that they could result in
the Internet serving only those who could afford good service. We
do not take a position on this debate in this paper (and therefore do
not explicitly prohibit such measures), but there is nothing in our
approach that would prevent the POC (or the attached LMPs) from
offering different qualities of service to customers. What we would
require is that these be openly offered, so that users could choose
their desired level of service and pay the resulting price. We would
not allow the POC or the attached LMPs to, on their own, decide to
favor certain traffic over others. Thus, we make a distinction between
service discrimination and QoS, and disallow the former while not
prohibiting the latter.
In addition, the POC could support multicast and anycast delivery
mechanisms, and any other standardized protocols that the IETF
adopts. More generally, the POC could offer emerging services at the
edge of its network, such as edge computing and network function
virtualization (NFV). In fact, the presence of a neutral and nonprofit
core might provide a place where such technologies – which are now
struggling because end users need a uniform approach across ISPs,
but there are no clear standards – could be tried out without worry

about proprietary advantages for one ISP over another (and LMPs
could then offer these same technologies if they wanted).
3.2 Payment Structure
The entities we consider are the POC, a set of BPs, a set of LMPs,
a set of CSPs, and customers (businesses and people). CSPs can
either connect directly to the POC, or use an LMP to connect them-
selves to the Internet. The overall theme of the structure described
below is that entities pay directly for what they receive.
• The POC pays the BPs to lease the links needed to create a
backbone network. The POC also pays one or more ISPs for
general access, so that the POC is connected to the rest of the
Internet.
• Each LMP (and directly-attached CSP) pays the POC for net-
work access.
• Each customer pays their LMP for network access. The customer
also pays directly for any non-free CSP services they use.
• Each CSP using an LMP pays its LMP for network access.
This payment scheme is obvious, but by following the philosophy
that entities pay directly for what they receive, we avoid the situation
where ISPs turn to CSPs to pay for the bandwidth that the ISP’s
customers are consuming (which is the sentiment expressed by Ed
Whitacre). Rather, in our scheme, if a user is ingesting too much
traffic, it isn’t the CSP who should pay, but rather the user herself.
If we allowed termination fees, then each CSP might have to pay
each LMP for access to their customers. In the next section, we
consider the implications of such charges, and reject them because
they give an advantage to incumbents. We also disallow CSPs from
paying remote LMPs to get priority service for their traffic when
it arrives at the destination LMP, for the same reason; this would
give an advantage to incumbent CSPs over emerging ones. One form
of such priority service would be allowing some CSPs to pay for
the right to install their own CDNs while disallowing others to do
the same. LMPs (and the POC itself) are free to provide open CDN
services (on a fee for service basis) or allow CSPs to install their
own CDNs or similar network functions (for a set fee); what LMPs
cannot do is only allow certain LMPs to use or deploy such services.
Our decisions about who pays whom for what does not dictate
or restrict the nature of the pricing schemes (as long as they are not
discriminatory) between any pair of entities. For instance, LMPs
might charge home users a flat price, or a strictly usage-based charge,
or some form of tiered service (a flat price up to a given level of
usage). We understand that there is a tension between giving users
some predictability in costs, while also charging based on usage so
that LMPs (and the POC itself) can finance capacity expansion. Our
proposal would allow the market to evolve over time to find practical
solutions that meet both of these (and future) needs.
In addition, the question of what the POC pays BPs for their leased
lines is conceptually separate from what the POC charges LMPs for
their usage. As we describe below, the POC uses a strategyproof
auction to pay BPs, but we leave open the question of how the POC
charges LMPs. This could be, among many other options, a usage-
based price just based on the sending/receiving rate, or it could be
based on the costs incurred by where those packets flow. The only
requirement is that the sum total of revenue from the LMPs is enough
to cover the bandwidth (and other) costs of the POC.
3.3 Bandwidth Auction
Building a POC entirely out of links that it owned and oper-
ated would require a tremendous upfront expenditure of capital. We
choose instead to initially create the POC’s backbone network out
of a set of leased lines, and use the interconnections to one or more
ISPs as a fallback if the POC’s backbone does not have sufficient
connectivity. Of course, eventually the POC can transition to par-
tially owning its infrastructure, but our concern here is to find a
practical way to get started.
These leased lines can come from traditional sources, as there is
already an active market for leased bandwidth. However, we also
expect that others, such as the large CSPs that have already built their
own backbone, would be eager to provide their excess bandwidth
for lease for two reasons. First, the large CSPs have a problematic
relationship with many large ISPs, in terms of who should pay for
bandwidth. These large CSPs would like to displace the current
large ISPs with a public backbone and a more innovative set of
LMPs; the Google Fiber effort [24] is evidence of this. Offering up
leased bandwidth to the POC would foster progress in this direction.
Second, the large CSPs that are building their own backbone face
hard provisioning choices, in terms of how much bandwidth to buy at
any particular time: buy too much and they have wasted money; but
buy too little and they run the risk of congestion on their backbone.
The availability of the POC means that they can overbuy, and then
lease out (on a temporary basis) their excess bandwidth but can
quickly recall it from the POC when needed.
We think it is important that the reimbursement scheme for leased
bandwidth be completely transparent, so that no one in the ecosystem
feels that the POC is favoring certain BPs. In addition, we want to
minimize the amount of effort devoted to strategic manipulation by
the BPs (i.e., rather than trying to figure out what the market will
bear, they can just focus on what minimal price would cover their
costs). To accomplish both of these goals, we use a strategy-proof
auction mechanism for bandwidth that is a special case of the general
class of VCG auctions [11, 26, 55].
VCG auctions are widely used in many market and allocation
mechanisms. The use of VCG auction for electricity markets (in the
US and elsewhere) is probably the closest to the bandwidth auction
discussed here; see [13] for a recent survey. VCG auctions are also
commonly used in financial markets such as in the US treasury
auctions of bills and bonds, see [30].
For the POC auction, each BP (whose instances are denoted by
𝛼) offers a set of links for lease, with a specified minimal acceptable
price for each subset of these links (assume this price is the monthly
leasing charge). That is, each BP 𝛼 provides a set of links 𝐿𝛼 and a
mapping 𝐶𝛼 from the powerset 2𝐿𝛼 to a minimal acceptable price
for that subset of links (and if a subset is not offered, its price is set
to be infinite). This allows the BP to offer discounts for multiple
links, or other non-additive variations in pricing.
The external ISPs to which the POC is connected play two roles.
First, they are needed to provide connectivity to the rest of the
Internet, so packets whose destinations are not directly attached
to the POC leave the POC through one of these ISPs. Second, we
assume that these ISPs attach to the POC in multiple locations and
thus they provide virtual links between these attachment points that
go through the ISPs rather than the POC itself. We denote by 𝑉 𝐿 the
A Public Option for the Core
SIGCOMM ’20, August 10–14, 2020, Virtual Event, NY, USA
set of these virtual links, and the cost of using them is dictated by the
long-term contract between the external ISPs and the POC, not by
the auction mechanism we describe below. We denote the cost of any
subset of virtual links 𝐿𝑣 ⊆ 𝑉 𝐿 to be 𝐶𝑣(𝐿𝑣). The presence of these
virtual links 𝑉 𝐿 provides the POC with a richer set of alternatives
for conveying packets between LMPs. We define 𝑂𝐿 as the set of
all offered links, both the virtual links provided by the external ISPs
and the union of the links offered by BPs: 𝑂𝐿 = 𝑉 𝐿 ∪ {∪𝛼 𝐿𝛼}.
We consider the set of attachment points to include all network
locations where LMPs, directly-connected CSPs, and external ISPs
are connected to the POC. We assume that the POC has some upper-
bound estimate of its traffic matrix (how much traffic flows between
each pair of attachment points). Given the set of offered links 𝑂𝐿,
the auction mechanism picks the lowest cost subset that (i) provides
enough bandwidth to handle this traffic matrix, and (ii) obeys what-
ever other constraints the POC desires (such as requiring that it can
still handle all the traffic even under some number of link failures).
To make this more precise, given the various constraints (handling
the traffic matrix, plus any additional constraints), we map the set
𝑂𝐿 to an acceptable subset of the powerset of 𝑂𝐿 that we will denote
by 𝐴(𝑂𝐿) ⊆ 2𝑂𝐿. Each element of 𝐴(𝑂𝐿) represents a set of links
that obeys the POC’s various constraints. In what follows we assume
that none of the external ISPs are also BPs, and the set of offered
links is such that 𝐴(𝑂𝐿 − 𝐿𝛼) is nonempty for all 𝛼; that is, these
constraints can be met even if one of the BPs does not participate.
Define 𝐶(𝐿) for some acceptable subset 𝐿 ∈ 𝐴(𝑂𝐿) as the total
cost of that subset of links:
𝐶(𝐿) =
𝐶𝛼 (𝐿 ∩ 𝐿𝛼) + 𝐶𝑣(𝐿 ∩ 𝑉 𝐿)

𝛼
The POC then picks the lowest cost member of the set 𝐴(𝑂𝐿): that
is, the set of selected links 𝑆𝐿 is given by
𝑆𝐿 = argmin 𝐶( ˜𝐿) 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 ˜𝐿 ∈ 𝐴(𝑂𝐿)
This just says that the POC selects the lowest cost solution that
obeys its constraints. The real question is how does it then pay the
BPs for their links. If the POC just pays their costs as determined by
𝐶𝛼 then each BP has an incentive to inflate their declared minimal
price. So, instead, we use a strategy-proof auction whereby BPs are
incentivized to reveal the minimal acceptable payments (via 𝐶𝛼 ),
which set the lower bound on what they will receive.
To define this mechanism, we need additional notation. For a
given BP 𝛼 define 𝑆𝐿+𝛼 = 𝑆𝐿 ∩ 𝐿𝛼 as the subset of 𝑆𝐿 that is in
𝐶𝑣(𝑆𝐿 ∩ 𝑉 𝐿). We further define
the set 𝐿𝛼 ; note that with this notation, 𝐶(𝑆𝐿) =𝛼 𝐶𝛼 (𝑆𝐿+𝛼) +
𝑆𝐿−𝛼 = argmin 𝐶( ˜𝐿) 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 ˜𝐿 ∈ 𝐴(𝑂𝐿 − 𝐿𝛼)
as the set of links that would be selected if BP 𝛼 did not offer any
links.
With these definitions, we can define the payoff to each normal
BP 𝛼 as:
𝑃𝛼 = 𝐶𝛼 (𝑆𝐿+𝛼) + (𝐶(𝑆𝐿−𝛼) − 𝐶(𝑆𝐿))
This VCG mechanism (which is essentially the Clarke pivot rule
[42]) selects the lowest cost options, and obeys the constraint that
the payoffs are no less than the value 𝐶𝛼 (𝑆𝐿+𝛼). This lower bound is
obeyed because the cost cannot go down if you reduce the number of
links available, so 𝐶(𝑆𝐿−𝛼) ≥ 𝐶(𝑆𝐿). The strategyproofness follows
from the fact that the values in this expression do not depend on any
Figure 2: We show the payment-over-bid margins (PoB) for the five largest
BPs (ordered in decreasing size).
of the prices set by 𝛼 (i.e., the value of 𝐶𝛼 (𝑆𝐿+𝛼) in the first and last
terms cancel out).
While VCG mechanisms have been applied to routing before,
our application here is more general. For instance, the approach
in [22] applied VCG mechanisms to a simplified form of routing
where all links were strategically independent (they were actually
BGP domains) and only lowest cost routing is used without capacity
constraints or resilience considerations. Here, we allow very general
route computations that can take these factors into account.
Like all VCG mechanisms, this auction is vulnerable to collusion,
but the presence of the connections to external ISPs sets an upper
bound on the costs of alternate paths, so any of the manipulations
mentioned below can only have limited impact. If the BPs can guess
in advance what the set 𝑆𝐿 is, they can decide to not offer any
links not in this set without changing their own payoff, but possibly
changing that of others. For instance, removing links 𝐿𝛽 − 𝑆𝐿 from
OL cannot make 𝐶(𝑆𝐿−𝛼) smaller, and can make it substantially
bigger, thereby increasing the payoff to BP 𝛼. At the same time,
doing so does not change 𝑆𝐿 nor 𝑃𝛽, so BP 𝛽 is unhurt by doing so.
If all the BPs do this, they could potentially all gain (even without
side payments). However, doing so requires them to know 𝑆𝐿 in
advance (because if they withdraw links in 𝑆𝐿 they can hurt their
own payoffs).
To illustrate how this auction might work in practice, we took
network data from TopologyZoo [33], filtered out some of the small
networks, combined some networks to form 20 BPs, and then placed
POC routers at points where there were four or more BPs closely
