### Purpose
I am developing a program that will set up a dedicated server (software created by game developers) for a game with minimal effort. A common step in making the server functional is port forwarding, which involves creating a port forward rule on a router. My friends and I have been port forwarding through conventional means for many years, with mixed results. Therefore, I aim to build a function that can automatically forward a port on a router when provided with the internal IP of the router, the internal IP of the current computer, the port number, and the protocol. I have explored several solutions but found them difficult to understand, especially those involving the socket module. I prefer not to use any software that is not generally installed on Windows, as I want this function to work on various systems.

### Approaches Explored
1. **Batch File with Netsh Commands:**
   - Creating a batch file that issues `netsh` commands to configure port forwarding.
   - Running the batch file to execute the commands.

2. **Router Settings Modification:**
   - Making changes to the router settings under "Network -> Network Infrastructure."
   - I am unsure how to access and modify these settings programmatically.

3. **Socket Module:**
   - Using the socket module to handle port forwarding, but I found it challenging due to my limited familiarity with the module.

### Additional Considerations
- **UPnP (Universal Plug and Play):**
  - UPnP is a protocol that allows devices to automatically forward ports, but it is often disabled by default for security reasons.
  
- **SSH Reverse Tunnels:**
  - SSH reverse tunnels can be an alternative approach to port forwarding. This method involves setting up an SSH tunnel from the server to a remote host, which can then forward traffic back to the server.

- **Cygwin:**
  - For advanced networking tasks on Windows, using Cygwin might be beneficial. Cygwin provides a large collection of GNU and Open Source tools, which can make working with network configurations easier.

- **Wireshark:**
  - Wireshark is a powerful network protocol analyzer that can help you understand and troubleshoot network traffic. It can be a valuable tool for debugging your port forwarding implementation.

### Request for Assistance
If anyone can provide guidance on how to implement any of the above approaches or suggest alternative methods, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you.
