User: Purpose:
I'm making a program that will set up a dedicated server (software made by game devs) for a game with minimal effort. One common step in making the server functional is port forwarding by making a port forward rule on a router.
Me and my friends have been port forwarding through conventional means for many years with mixed results. As such I am hoping to build a function that will forward a port on a router when given the internal ip of the router, the internal ip of the current computer,the port and the protocol. I have looked for solutions for similar problems, but I found the solutions difficult to understand since i'm not really familiar with the socket module. I would prefer not to use any programs that are not generally installed on windows since I plan to have this function work on systems other than my own.
Approaches I have explored:
Creating a bat file that issues commands by means of netsh, then running the bat.
Making additions to the settings in a router found under Network -> Network Infrastructure (I do not know how to access these settings programmaticly).
(I'm aware programs such as GameRanger do this)
Using the Socket Module.
If anyone can shed some light how I can accomplish any of the above approaches or give me some insight on how I can approach this problem another way I would greatly appreciate it.
Thank you.

Assistant: You should read first some sort of informations about UPnP (Router Port-Forwarding) and that it's normally disabled.  
Dependent of your needs, you could also try a look at ssh reverse tunnels and at ssh at all, as it can solve many problems.
But you will see that working with windows and things like adavanced network things is a bad idea.
At least you should use cygwin.  
And when you really interessted in network traffic at all, wireshark should be installed.
