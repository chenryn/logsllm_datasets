When running `gotype` on the `$GOROOT/src/pkg/net` directory, several error messages are generated due to unresolved `import "C"` statements. To improve the user experience, `go/types` could be more lenient with invalid operands and types, thereby reducing follow-up errors.

For example, type conversions of the form `T(x)` could always succeed, even if `x` is invalid. Additionally, other operations should not report an error if one of the operands is already known to be invalid. This approach would help in providing a cleaner and more manageable set of error messages.
