    gotype $GOROOT/src/pkg/net
    leads to several error messages due to unresolvable 'import "C"'.
    go/types could be more tolerant with invalid operands and types to avoid follow-up
    errors.
    (For instance, conversions of the form T(x) could always succeed even if x is invalid.
    Other operations should not report an error if an operand is already invalid.)
