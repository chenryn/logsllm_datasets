User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题What does WEP access point show during aircrack-ng attack? I bought an old, used WRT-54G () which strangely enough, was running DD-WRT v24-sp2.  Weird what turns up at yard sales.

I want to try the "aircrack-ng" WEP cracking procedure on it.  The criteria for success is easy: when "aircrack-ng" delivers me the WEP key.

But what should I see on the DD-WRT side?  I have this DD-WRT instance set to write syslog data to another Linux machine on the ethernet (wire) side, so I can see whatever DD-WRT logs. Does any other logging facility exist that I should watch?

Assistant: WEP cracking is a function if capturing a lot of traffic and brute forcing the mis-implementation of RC4 and initial vectors (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Equivalent_Privacy#Flaws). The only thing which may differ from "normal" traffic is the rate. If you are logging all of the authentications and handshakes, you would have to do some statistics on the timing of the events and compare them to a baseline. I do not believe the DD-WRT provide detail system logs of the actual packet traffic that might be useful to also look at. 

If you are asking, how to detect a WEP attack on my network, the first response would be - WEP is easily attacked, so expect that if you must use WEP it will be compromised. Alternatively, you could look into Wireless Intrusion Prevention Systems, which could detect what it deems abnormal activity or matches patterns of suspicious activity.
