When using the Symfony Form Type "time", e.g.
`$builder->->add('fromTime', 'time', [ 'widget' => 'choice', 'attr' =>
['class' => 'form-control'], 'model_timezone' => "UTC", 'view_timezone' =>
"Europe/Berlin" ])`
The "reverseTransform" in "DateTimeToArrayTransformer" converts the form input
back to the model_timezone. Since there is only an "hour" and "minutes" input,
the method uses the year 1970 as a helper to create the date object.
`$dateTime = new \DateTime(sprintf( '%s-%s-%s %s:%s:%s %s',
empty($value['year']) ? '1970' : $value['year'], empty($value['month']) ? '1'
: $value['month'], empty($value['day']) ? '1' : $value['day'],
empty($value['hour']) ? '0' : $value['hour'], empty($value['minute']) ? '0' :
$value['minute'], empty($value['second']) ? '0' : $value['second'],
$this->outputTimezone ))`
And afterwards is converted to the inputTimezone (model_timezone).
Unfortunately, it produces unexpected results:  
E.g. "1970-01-01 12:45:00" is converting to "1970-01-01 11:45:00", which is
wrong (and somehow right at the same time). And here is the reason - in 1970,
there was no daylight saving time in this timezone, so there is only a +1
difference between "UTC" and "Europe/Berlin". Now, there should be a +2 hours
difference.
This generally applies to dates out of the daylight saving times.
Proposed fix: Instead of 1970-01-01, the current year / month / day should be
used in the transformer, if no input date was specified. But I must confess,
that both versions lead to unexpected behavior which is not ideal.
