Question: "An organization is looking to enhance its network security posture against adversaries known to exfiltrate data in fixed-size chunks. Which of the following is the most effective mitigation technique, and what are its potential limitations?"
 "A": "Implementing strict egress filtering rules could prevent unauthorized data transfers, but may also block legitimate traffic if not configured correctly."
 "B": "Deploying network intrusion prevention systems that use signatures to identify specific adversary infrastructure could mitigate this type of exfiltration, though adversaries could change their infrastructure to bypass such signatures."
 "C": "Increasing the threshold for network data transfer alerts could help in catching large chunks of data, but adversaries could adapt by sending even smaller chunks."
 "D": "Enforcing full disk encryption on all endpoints would render exfiltrated data useless, but it would not prevent the exfiltration itself."
Answer: B
