### Leading Supplier and Popular Robots
1. Rockwell Automation, the leading PLC supplier in North America, holds 60% of the market share [17].
2. The company is also known for its widely used industrial robots worldwide [1].

### SMART Testbed for Manufacturing Model Vehicles
The SMART Testbed for Manufacturing Model Vehicles (Figure 1) was developed by engineers from Rockwell Automation, faculty, and graduate students. The hardware components and their connections closely resemble those found in real-world factory floors. A significant portion of the control system, including robot motion, CNC operation, and RFID I/O, is based on industry practices [7]. The fidelity of this control system has been verified through consistent collaboration with Rockwell Automation.

### Physical Compositions
- **Gantry System**: Serves as the entry and exit points of the testbed. It delivers empty pallets to CNC machine #1 to start the manufacturing process and removes the produced parts from the conveyor.
- **Conveyor Belt**: A circular conveyor belt that continuously moves pallets around the robots and CNC machines.
- **Robot and CNC Cells**:
  - **Cell 1**: Comprises Robot #1 and CNC #1, responsible for tasks such as molding.
  - **Cell 2**: Contains the remaining robots and CNCs, handling tasks like flipping.
- **RFID Transceivers**: Positioned in front of each cell, these transceivers can detect the presence of incoming pallets, whether empty or loaded. RFID tags are attached to both pallets and parts, maintaining a numerical value indicating the next manufacturing process.
- **Pallet Stopper**: Installed in each cell to block moving pallets. By default, the stopper is enabled to block any arriving pallets unless a signal indicates otherwise.

### PLC and Robot Logics
Figures 2 and 8 (in Appendix A) illustrate the control logic of the PLC and Robot #1 in Cell 1, respectively. These code snippets show how a processed part is passed from the CNC to the conveyor.

- **PLC Code (Figure 2)**: After a raw part is delivered to the CNC for processing, the PLC code expects to receive the processed part and deliver it to the next cell using an empty pallet. The coordination between the PLC and robot is achieved through events.
  - **Input Variables (Ln.3-7, 52)**: Six input variables are declared.
  - **Output Variables (Ln.8-9)**: Two output variables are declared.
  - **Internal Variables (Ln.11-13, 49)**: Four internal variables are declared.
  - **Initialization (Ln.16-19)**: The PLC clears the output variables during initialization.
  - **Input Checks (Ln.21-44)**: The PLC checks all input variables sequentially to update the outputs.

- **Pallet Arrival (Ln.21-23)**: The PLC updates the availability of an empty pallet at Cell 1 by checking the presence of a pallet and the absence of a part.
- **Loaded Pallet (Ln.25-27)**: If an incoming pallet is already loaded with a part, the PLC sends a signal to retract the stopper and allow the pallet to pass through.
- **Processed Part Delivery (Ln.29-34)**: The PLC further checks the Boolean inputs (CNC Part Ready, Robot Ready, and NOT(Part AtConveyor)) to confirm the existence of a processed part, the availability of the robot, and the clearance of parts on the conveyor. If all conditions are met, the PLC performs two actions:
  1. **Deliver Part**: Triggers the robot program to pick up the part from the CNC and pass it to the conveyor.
  2. **Update Part Process**: Calls a subroutine to update the manufacturing process number on the part.

### Robot Code (Figure 8)
- **Part Pickup (Ln.6-12)**: The robot picks up a part from the CNC machine.
- **Part Delivery (Ln.18-20)**: The robot passes the part to the conveyor.
- **Completion Signal (Ln.22-24)**: The robot turns on its output signal DO[2] for 0.5 seconds to indicate the completion, which is mapped to Part AtConveyor on the PLC.

### Safety Violation and Root Cause
This code can lead to item overflow, a common safety issue on factory floors. The root cause is the mismatched expectations between the robot (sender) and the PLC (receiver) regarding the duration of the Part AtConveyor event.

- **Dual Purpose Signal**: Part AtConveyor indicates when the robot has delivered a part to the pallet and when the conveyor is cleared to accept a new part.
- **Timeout Implementation**: To save time, the robot developers implemented a timeout, allowing the Part AtConveyor event to last only 0.5 seconds, regardless of whether the conveyor is cleared.
- **Premature Signal Off**: If the robot turns off Part AtConveyor prematurely, the PLC may never see both Part AtConveyor and Update Complete set to true simultaneously, leading to pallets not leaving the cell and causing conveyor overflow.

### Real-World Error
A real-world error has been reported from the SMART testbed when the robot's speed is increased, and Part AtConveyor ends before the update of the process number is complete. This results in no window where both Update Complete and Part AtConveyor are true, causing the conveyor to overflow and potentially leading to collisions and breakage.

### Common Problem
This issue is not unique to collaborative PLCs and robots but can occur in the coordination of any types of controllers, such as multiple PLCs, PLCs and CNCs, or CNCs and robots. Many PLC safety problems arise from the coordination required between multiple units, often due to different vendors and individual programming without considering timing and context. Addressing issues involving PLCs and robots is particularly challenging due to the need to understand multiple programming languages and their interactions.
