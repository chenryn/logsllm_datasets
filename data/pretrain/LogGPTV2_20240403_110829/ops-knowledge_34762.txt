Question: You have inherited a large and complex codebase written in a memory-unsafe language, which you have been asked to update. Considering the impracticality of reasoning about each memory access and the necessity of employing code hardening defenses, select the options that correctly describe the purpose and effectiveness of these defenses:
"A": "Code hardening defenses ensure the complete elimination of memory safety exploits in the code.",
"B": "They are intended to make exploiting vulnerabilities harder and ideally cause any exploit attempts to fail by crashing the program.",
"C": "The use of multiple code hardening defenses together can create a compound effect, making it more challenging for an attacker to exploit the system.",
"D": "Code hardening defenses replace the need for reviewing and reasoning about the memory access in the code, thus fully guaranteeing security."
