User: I have created an virtual environment by using virtualenv pyenv in my linux system. Now i want to use the virtual environment in another computer. Can i direct copy the virtual environment and use it in another computer? Or need i do something to set up it?
Assistant: You should not. The other computer can have a different operating system, other packages or package versions installed, so copying the files will not work.
The point of a virtual environment is to be able to replicate it everywhere you need it.
Make a script which installs all necessary dependencies from a requirements.txt file and use it.
Use pip freeze > requirements.txt to get the list of all python packages installed. Then install the dependencies in another virtual environment on another computer using pip install -r requirements.txt.
If you want the exact environment, including system packages, on another computer, use Docker.
