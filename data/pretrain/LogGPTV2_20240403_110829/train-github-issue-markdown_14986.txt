The "Link in the corner" at docs.julialang.org appears to be broken. I believe this issue should be reported on the GitHub repository for the julialang.org website. As this seems to be the appropriate place to report it, I am letting you know. Additionally, there are other related issues, such as the one mentioned in [JuliaLang/www.julialang.org#684](https://github.com/JuliaLang/www.julialang.org/issues/684).

For reference, the non-functioning link is located in the corner of at least the following page:
- [NEWS.md](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/doc/src/NEWS.md)

Feel free to let me know if any further adjustments are needed!
