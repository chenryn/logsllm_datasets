**Title: Botconf2016 - ISFB: Still Active and Evolving**

Also known as Gozi2 or Ursnif, and sometimes referred to as Rovnix, ISFB reemerged in early 2013, capturing the attention of the research community and causing significant confusion in its naming conventions. After a brief period of inactivity, it resurfaced, evolving under the radar while the cybersecurity world focused on Dridex and Dyre. Today, ISFB stands as one of the most sophisticated and feature-rich banking trojans.

In this paper, we aim to shed light on ISFB's capabilities, which go beyond those of a typical banking trojan. It employs four distinct methods for communicating with its command-and-control (C&C) servers, utilizes several techniques to steal financial information, can record user activities, and manipulates web traffic in various ways. The malware is also well-structured, featuring a custom configuration format, unique cryptographic methods, and clean code, making it an intriguing subject for analysis.

While ISFB is an ideal target for security analysts due to its complexity, its broad range of functionalities makes it a preferred tool for cybercriminals. It ranks among the most popular banking trojans, alongside Vawtrak and ZeuS derivatives.

However, modern malware is not just about the binary file; it involves a comprehensive infrastructure supporting its operations. We will provide an overview of the architecture used by ISFB, including the multi-tiered system leading to the C&C server. Additionally, we will share a set of scripts and indicators of compromise (IoCs) to aid in detecting and analyzing this threat, as well as extracting key configuration details and web injects.
