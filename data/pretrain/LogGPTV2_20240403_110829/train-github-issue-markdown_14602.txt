Presently the facetgrid accept:
row, col, hue : strings  
Variables that define subsets of the data, which will be drawn on separate
facets in the grid.
Suppose I want to use a variable that it is not a column of my dataset, but
that it can be computed starting from that. What I need to do now is to add a
new column to my dataset and then use the name of this new column as argument.
Suppose I want to set the hue depending on the column 'column1' which is of
type string, but I want to ignore the case. What about something like this:
    hue = lambda x: x['column1'].capitalize()
In addition it would be nice to add the possibility to use ranges. Suppose I
want to set hue depending on column 'column2' which is of type float. Here I
want to define categories depending on some binning as in pandas.Cut. As
before I would like to avoid to add a column to my dataframe just to do a
plot.
