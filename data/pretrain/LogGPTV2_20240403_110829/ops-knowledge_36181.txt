User: I have a Windows machine with Python 2.3, 2.6 and 3.0 installed and 2.5 installed with Cygwin. I've downloaded the pexpect package but when I run "python setup.py install" it installs to the 2.6 installation.
How could I have it install to the Cygwin Python installation, or any other installation?
Assistant: using "python2.3" can be wrong if another (default) installation patched PATH to itself only.
Task can be solved by:

finding full path to desired python interpreter, on ActivePython it is C:\Python26 for default installation of Python 2.6
make a full path to binary (in this case C:\Python26\python.exe)
execute module install command from unpacked module directory using full path to interpreter:   C:\Python26\python.exe setup.py install
