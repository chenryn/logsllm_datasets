To install the `pexpect` package to a specific Python installation, such as the one under Cygwin, you can follow these steps:

1. **Locate the Desired Python Interpreter:**
   - Identify the full path to the Python interpreter you want to use. For example, if you are using Cygwin, the path might be something like `C:\cygwin64\bin\python2.5.exe`.

2. **Navigate to the Unpacked Package Directory:**
   - Ensure that you have downloaded and extracted the `pexpect` package to a directory on your system.

3. **Run the Installation Command with the Full Path:**
   - Open a command prompt or terminal.
   - Navigate to the directory where the `pexpect` package is located.
   - Use the full path to the desired Python interpreter to run the `setup.py` script. For example:
     ```sh
     C:\cygwin64\bin\python2.5.exe setup.py install
     ```

By specifying the full path to the Python interpreter, you ensure that the `pexpect` package is installed in the correct environment.

### Additional Notes:
- **Environment Variables:**
  - If you encounter issues with the `PATH` environment variable, you may need to adjust it temporarily or use the full path to the Python executable as shown above.
  
- **Cygwin-Specific Considerations:**
  - When using Cygwin, ensure that the paths are correctly formatted for the Cygwin environment. You might need to use Cygwin's `bash` shell to run the installation command, and the paths should be in the Unix-like format (e.g., `/usr/bin/python2.5`).

- **Alternative Method:**
  - You can also use virtual environments to manage different Python installations more easily. Tools like `virtualenv` or `venv` can help create isolated environments for each Python version.

By following these steps, you should be able to install the `pexpect` package to the desired Python installation, including the one under Cygwin.
