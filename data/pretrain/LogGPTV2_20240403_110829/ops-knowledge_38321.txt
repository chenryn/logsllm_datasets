User: i want to make a chat room on gae ,(audio chat)
has any framework to do this  ?

Assistant: You'll need two things:
A browser plugin to get audio. You could build this on top of eg. http://code.google.com/p/libjingle/'>libjingle which has the advantage of being cross-platform and allowing P2P communication, not to mention being able to talk to arbitrary other XMPP endoints. Or you could use Flash to grab the audio and bounce the stream off a server you build (I think trying to do STUN in Flash for P2P would be impossible), but this would be very tricky to do in App Engine because you'd need it to be long-running.
A way to get signaling messages between your clients. You'll have to poll until the Channel API is released (soon).
This is a big hairy problem, to put it mildly, but it would be awesome if you did it.
