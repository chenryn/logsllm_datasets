User: I'm new in Python/GAE and jinja2, and I want to present a schema of this architecture with displaying that in Layered, like this:

Presentation Layer: HTML+CSS+JQUERY
Business Layer: webapp2
DAO Layer: (I don't know what I put here  when it's Python, I find some exemples for java thay put here  "JDO orJDO or low level API")
Data Layer: appengine DataStore

My questions: 

Regarding jinja2, where can I put it?
What can I put in DAO layer for Python/GAE 

Thanks
Assistant: These are very artificial distinctions, and it's a mistake to assume that all apps have each of these layers, or that any particular function will fit only into one of them.
Jinja2 is a template language. It's firmly in the presentation layer.
There isn't really any such thing as the data access layer. If you really need to put something here, one possibility would be whichever library you are using to access the data: ndb or the older db.
