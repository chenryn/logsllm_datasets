User: i'm still confusing find bandwidth value using ifconfig eth0 , because it's very different if i see tutorial from os linux but my pc still os window 7 ..
Is there any other way to find bandwidth value in window 7 ? 
because i must find byte from ifconfig for convert to Kbps
Assistant: problem solved C:\windows\system32\ipconfig on cmd
