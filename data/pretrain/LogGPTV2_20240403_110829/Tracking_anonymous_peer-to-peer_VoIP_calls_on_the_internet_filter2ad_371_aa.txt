## Abstract

Peer-to-peer (P2P) Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calls are gaining popularity due to their cost-effectiveness and convenience. When these calls are end-to-end encrypted and anonymized using low-latency anonymizing networks, they are often perceived as both secure and anonymous.

In this paper, we introduce a watermarking technique that can effectively identify and correlate encrypted P2P VoIP calls, even when they are anonymized by low-latency anonymizing networks. This finding challenges the common perception of their security and anonymity. The core idea is to embed a unique watermark into the encrypted VoIP flow by slightly adjusting the timing of selected packets. Our analysis shows that only a few milliseconds of time adjustment can make VoIP flows highly unique, and the embedded watermark can be preserved across the anonymizing network if appropriate redundancy is applied.

Our analytical results are supported by real-time experiments conducted on leading P2P VoIP clients and commercially deployed anonymizing networks. These results demonstrate that (1) tracking anonymous P2P VoIP calls on the Internet is feasible, and (2) low-latency anonymizing networks are vulnerable to timing attacks.

## 1. Introduction

Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) allows users to make phone calls over the public Internet rather than traditional Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). VoIP offers significant cost savings and more flexible, advanced features compared to Plain Old Telephone System (POTS). As a result, an increasing number of voice calls are now carried at least partially via VoIP. According to consulting firm Frost & Sullivan, VoIP is expected to account for approximately 75% of world voice services by 2007.

For privacy reasons, individuals sometimes prefer their phone conversations to remain anonymous, ensuring that no one else knows they have communicated. VoIP, especially when used between computers, makes it easier to achieve anonymity in voice communications. VoIP calls between peer computers do not have associated phone numbers, and they can be protected by end-to-end encryption and routed through low-latency anonymizing networks (e.g., Onion Routing, Tor, Freedom, and Tarzan) to achieve anonymity. People generally believe that end-to-end encrypted and anonymized VoIP calls are secure and anonymous.

However, law enforcement agencies (LEAs) often need to conduct lawful electronic surveillance to combat crime and terrorism. For instance, LEAs require techniques to determine who has called the surveillance target and to whom the target has called. In a letter to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), several federal LEAs emphasized the importance of tracking VoIP calls for national security and law enforcement interests.

Balancing the need for privacy and anonymity with the security requirements of LEAs is a contentious issue. In this paper, we focus on the technical feasibility of tracking anonymous P2P VoIP calls on the Internet, leaving the broader debate aside. Our goal is to investigate practical techniques for effectively tracking anonymous VoIP calls and identifying weaknesses in currently deployed anonymous communication systems.

We chose to investigate the popular Skype P2P VoIP calls in the context of the anonymous Virtual Private Network (VPN) provided by findnot.com. Skype offers free computer-to-computer VoIP calls based on KaZaa P2P technology. Several properties of Skype make it an attractive candidate for our study:

- **Widespread Use:** Since August 2003, there have been over 100 million downloads of the Skype client, and it is actively used by millions of people worldwide. Skype is included in KaZaa v3.0.
- **Encryption:** All Skype traffic is end-to-end encrypted using 256-bit AES encryption.
- **Firewall and NAT Traversal:** Skype can automatically traverse most firewalls and Network Address Translation (NAT) gateways with the help of intermediate peers.
- **Dynamic Routing:** Skype intelligently and dynamically routes encrypted calls through different peers to achieve low latency. The route and intermediate peers can change during a call.
- **Proprietary Signaling Protocol:** Skype uses a proprietary P2P signaling protocol to set up VoIP calls.

Since most Skype calls use UDP, we cannot directly use anonymizing systems like Onion Routing, Tor, or anonymizer.com, which do not support the anonymization of all UDP flows. Instead, we use the anonymous communication services provided by findnot.com, which support the anonymization of all IP protocols through Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP).

The key challenge in tracking encrypted VoIP calls across anonymizing systems is identifying the correlation between the VoIP flows of the caller and the callee. Since all P2P VoIP traffic is encrypted, no signaling information is available for correlation. To track encrypted, anonymous VoIP calls, we leverage the timing characteristics of the anonymized VoIP flow. However, the original inter-packet arrival characteristics of VoIP flows are not distinct enough, as the inter-packet timing is determined by the frame packetization interval. Therefore, passive comparison of inter-packet timing characteristics will not distinguish different VoIP calls.

To uniquely identify anonymous VoIP calls, we use an active approach to deliberately make the inter-packet timing more distinctive. We embed a unique watermark into the inter-packet timing of the VoIP flows by slightly adjusting the timing of selected packets. If the embedded watermark is unique and robust, the watermarked VoIP flows can be effectively identified. By using redundancy techniques, we can make the embedded watermark robust against random timing perturbations, provided there are enough packets in the VoIP flow.

Our analytical and experimental results show that (1) tracking anonymous P2P VoIP calls on the Internet is feasible, and (2) low-latency anonymizing systems are susceptible to timing attacks. Our VoIP tracking technique does not require global monitoring capability and can determine if party A is communicating (or has communicated) with party B via P2IP VoIP, even if the VoIP traffic is disguised by low-latency anonymizing systems.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows:
- **Section 2:** Formulates the problem of tracking anonymous P2P VoIP calls and describes the overall tracing model.
- **Section 3:** Presents the active timing-based tracking method and analyzes its effectiveness.
- **Section 4:** Describes our implementation of the high-precision VoIP watermarking engine in the real-time Linux kernel.
- **Section 5:** Evaluates the effectiveness of our method empirically.
- **Section 6:** Summarizes related works.
- **Section 7:** Concludes the paper.

## 2. Overall Model of Tracing Anonymous Peer-to-Peer VoIP Calls

Given any two different Skype peers, A and B, we aim to determine if A is talking (or has talked) to B via Skype P2P VoIP. As shown in Figure 1, both Skype peers A and B have outgoing and incoming VoIP flows to and from the Internet cloud. The Skype peers could be behind firewalls and NAT, and either peer A or B (or both) could be connected to a low-latency anonymizing network. We view the Internet cloud and any low-latency anonymizing network as a black box, focusing only on the Skype flows entering or exiting the black box. We assume that (1) we can monitor the Skype flow from the black box to the Skype peer, and (2) we can perturb the timing of the Skype flow from the Skype peer to the black box.

We do not intend to track all P2P VoIP calls between anyone and anyone, nor do we assume global monitoring and intercepting capabilities. Instead, we focus on determining if specific parties of interest have communicated via P2P VoIP calls anonymously, and we only need the capability to monitor and intercept IP flows to and from those interested parties. This model aligns with the common practice of lawful electronic surveillance by LEAs.

Since Skype VoIP flows are end-to-end encrypted, no correlation can be found from the flow content. Given that the VoIP flow may pass through intermediate Skype peers and a low-latency anonymizing network, there is no correlation from the VoIP flow headers. Among all the characteristics of the VoIP flows, the inter-packet timing characteristics are likely to be preserved across intermediate peers and the anonymizing network. This invariant property forms the foundation for tracking anonymous P2P VoIP calls on the Internet.

Several timing-based correlation methods have been proposed, which can be classified into passive and active approaches. Passive timing-based correlation methods (e.g., [35], [34], [33], [7], [5]) correlate encrypted flows based on passive comparison of their timing characteristics and have been effective when the timing characteristics of each flow are unique. However, the inter-packet timing characteristics of all VoIP flows are very similar. The inter-packet arrival time of VoIP flows is determined by the voice codec and the corresponding packetization interval, and there are only a few commonly used intervals (e.g., 20ms or 30ms). Therefore, passively comparing the timing characteristics of VoIP flows will not distinguish different VoIP flows.

Wang and Reeves [32] proposed the first active approach to correlate encrypted flows by embedding a unique watermark into the inter-packet timing domain through deliberate timing adjustment of selected packets. This method has the potential to differentiate flows with very similar timing characteristics. However, the method in [32] cannot be directly used for VoIP flows due to the following reasons:
- **Real-Time Constraints:** VoIP traffic has stringent real-time constraints, and the total end-to-end delay should be less than 150ms.
- **Short Inter-Packet Arrival Time:** The inter-packet arrival time of VoIP flows is very short (e.g., 20ms or 30ms), requiring precise and small time adjustments.
- **Packet Buffering:** The watermarking method in [32] requires packet buffering to achieve even timing adjustment, which is too long for real-time VoIP flows.

To correlate anonymous VoIP flows with similar inter-packet timing characteristics, we use an active approach to subtly yet deliberately make the inter-packet timing characteristics more unique. This is achieved by embedding a unique watermark into the inter-packet timing domain of the VoIP flow in real-time.

To address the limitations of previous work [32], we use a new watermarking scheme suitable for tracking anonymous VoIP traffic in real-time. The key challenge is to precisely adjust the packet timing without buffering and ensure even time adjustment of the selected packets.
