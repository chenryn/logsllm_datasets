User: You need to investigate the reason why the CPU usage of a server is too high, how to do it?
Assistant: First, you need to determine the server's operating system, CPU model, number of cores, frequency, and other information. Next, you can follow the steps below: 1. Use commands like top or htop to view the CPU usage of processes and find out the processes with high CPU usage. 2. Use the pidstat command to check the CPU usage, IO, memory and other related information of a specific process. 3. Analyze the functions of the processes, determine which processes cause the high CPU usage, and troubleshoot and optimize these processes. 4. If the problem is still not solved, you can adjust the system kernel parameters or upgrade the patch. 5. Regularly perform performance evaluation, tuning and optimization on the server to avoid the recurrence of high CPU usage.
