Assistant: The steps to install and configure the Nginx web server on a Linux server are as follows: 1. Install the Nginx package: Run the following command in a Linux terminal to install the Nginx package. sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install nginx 2. Start the Nginx service: After the installation is complete, use the following command to start the Nginx service. sudo systemctl start nginx 3. Configure Nginx: Configure Nginx in Linux by modifying the configuration file. By default, Nginx's configuration file is located in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf. The file can be opened with the following command. sudo vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf Note: Using the vim editor to modify configuration files requires mastering basic vim editing commands. 4. Configure the website: To run a simple website, you need to add a server block to the configuration file. Add the server block to the Nginx configuration file using the following command. server { listen 80; server_name example.com; location / { root /var/www/html; index index.html; } } Description: - listen: Specify the port that Nginx listens to, here is 80. - server_name: Specifies the domain name of the website. - location: Specify the document root directory and homepage file. 5. Check and reload the configuration: To check the Nginx configuration file for syntax errors, run the following command. sudo nginx -t If there are no errors, then reload the configuration with the following command. sudo systemctl reload nginx 6. Compose the webpage and add it to the website. There are several ways to create web pages on a Linux server. Basic HTML and CSS can be used, or a CMS (Content Management System) can be used. HTML files can be placed in a specified document root directory. In this example, the document root is /var/www/html. sudo vim /var/www/html/index.html Write html content as follows: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>My First Nginx Website</title> </head> <body> <h1>Hello , Nginx!</h1> </body> </html> 7. Access the website through a browser. To access the website through a browser, make sure port 80 is open in the firewall on the server. You can run the following command to check firewall rules. sudo ufw app list If there is a rule called Nginx Full, then port 80 is already opened. The rule can be turned on or off by running the following command. sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full' sudo ufw delete allow 'Nginx Full' Use a browser to access the website and enter the server IP address or domain name.
