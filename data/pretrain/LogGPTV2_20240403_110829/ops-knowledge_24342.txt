Question: Consider a web application for an online bookstore that allows users to browse books, add them to their cart, and proceed to checkout. If a user discovers that by intercepting the request during checkout and modifying the price parameter, they can reduce the cost of the book to a lower, unauthorized price, which of the following is the most likely outcome of exploiting this business logic flaw?
"A": "The application will complete the transaction at the reduced price, resulting in financial loss to the bookstore.",
"B": "The application will recognize the price discrepancy, alert the user, and request to proceed at the correct price.",
"C": "The application will automatically generate a discount coupon equal to the price modification attempted by the user.",
"D": "The application will donate the equivalent amount of the price discrepancy to a literacy charity."
Answer: A
