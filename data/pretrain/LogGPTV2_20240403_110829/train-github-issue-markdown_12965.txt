While upgrading to version `0.13`, I encountered significant difficulties in identifying issues caused by the duplicate use of `createFactory`. However, the component names in the warnings provided some helpful context:

```
Warning: Factory.type is deprecated. Access the class directly before passing it to createFactory.
```

Here is a screenshot for reference:

This warning suggests that the `Factory.type` property is no longer recommended and advises accessing the class directly before using `createFactory`.
