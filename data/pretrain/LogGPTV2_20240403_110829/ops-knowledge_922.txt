User: I need to call a Python script from Labview, someone know which is the best method to do that?
I've tried Labpython, but it is not supported on newest versions of Labview and I'm not able to use it on Labview-2014.

Assistant: You can save Python script as a large string constant(or load from text file) within the LabVIEW vi so that it can be manipulated within LabVIEW and then save that to a text file then execute the Python script using command line in LabVIEW. Python yourscript enter
