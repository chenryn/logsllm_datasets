Here's an example folder structure (as silly as it may be)
    pages/
      - subpage/
         - index.js
      - subpage.js
If I have a `` point to `/subpage/` the client will render the
component from `subpage.js`, but when I refresh the page, I get the
`subpage/index.js` file rendered.
At first I noticed this was an issue with the server routing not working well
if the path ends with a `/`, but then I realized that there are cases in which
you may want an `index.js` in a folder, so it's not necessarily problematic
that you get a `404` when you don't have the `index.js`.
However, when there's a naming collision between a file and a folder, the
client and the server behave differently and I think there should be a
discussion around this situation, because I can't say there's a clear solution
at this point.
