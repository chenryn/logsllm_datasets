User: I have a Debian system currently running with python 2.5.4. I got virtualenv properly installed, everything is working fine. Is there a possibility that I can use a virtualenv with a different version of Python?
I compiled Python 2.6.2 and would like to use it with some virtualenv. Is it enough to overwrite the binary file? Or do I have to change something in respect to the libraries?
Assistant: Surprised that no one has mentioned conda so far. I have found this is a lot more straightforward than the other methods mentioned here. Let's say I have python 3.9 and python 2.7 and a project I am working on was python 3.5.4, I could simply create the isolated virtual env for 3.5.4 with the conda command without downloading anything else.
To see a list of available python versions first, use the command
conda search "^python$"
To create the virtual environment for python version x.y.z, use the command
conda create -n yourenvname python=x.y.z
Activate venv with
conda activate yourenvname
Deactivate with
conda deactivate
To delete the virtual environment when done, use the command
conda remove -n yourenvname --all
