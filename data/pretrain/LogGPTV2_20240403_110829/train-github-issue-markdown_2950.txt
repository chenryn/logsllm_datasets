### Issue Description

I am encountering an issue that may be related to #4492, but it has now appeared in Symfony v2.7.3. The problem is that reordering form collections using AJAX submissions does not work correctly.

### Context

I have an entity called "Meeting" which contains a collection of "Topics". Each "Topic" has an integer field called "position" that is used to determine the order of the topics. When reordering the topics, the "position" field is updated using JavaScript based on the current order.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. **Initial State:**
   - `topic[0]`: Topic ZERO, position 0
   - `topic[1]`: Topic ONE, position 1

2. **Reorder Topics (using jQuery):**
   - After reordering, the topics look like this:
     - `topic[1]`: Topic ONE, position 0
     - `topic[0]`: Topic ZERO, position 1

3. **Save Reordered State via AJAX:**
   - The new order is saved to the database using AJAX. The DOM in the browser remains unchanged.

4. **Reorder Again:**
   - The topics are reordered back to their original positions:
     - `topic[0]`: Topic ZERO, position 0
     - `topic[1]`: Topic ONE, position 1

5. **Save Again via AJAX:**
   - The new order is saved again using AJAX. No visible changes occur in the browser.

6. **Reload the Page:**
   - After reloading the page, the following unexpected state is observed:
     - `topic[1]`: Topic ZERO, position 0
     - `topic[0]`: Topic ONE, position 1

### Problem

- **Issue:** The order of the topics is not being correctly updated. Instead, the content of the topics is being reassigned to the new positions, leading to incorrect topic content.
- **Expected Behavior:** The topics should maintain their correct content and only their positions should change.

### Additional Information

- If I use a standard POST submission with a page reload instead of AJAX, the reordering works as expected.

### Question

What could be causing this issue, and how can it be resolved?

Thank you for your help!
