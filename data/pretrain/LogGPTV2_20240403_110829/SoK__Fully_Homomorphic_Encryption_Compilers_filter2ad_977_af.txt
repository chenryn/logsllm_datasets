Finally, it is worth noting that we have considered only
FHE tools in our analysis and discussion. However, real-world
problems are frequently complex and require a combination of
techniques, including FHE, Multi-Party Computation (MPC),
and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP). In the long term, the
secure computation community could gain tremendously by
considering these problems more holistically and building
tools that support a wider range of techniques.
