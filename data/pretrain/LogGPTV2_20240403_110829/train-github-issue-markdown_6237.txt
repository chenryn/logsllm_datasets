There appears to be an issue with the challenge available at <http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-link-to-external-pages-with-anchor-elements>. Here is a detailed description of how to reproduce the problem:

1. Visit the challenge page: <http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-link-to-external-pages-with-anchor-elements>.
2. Click on the anchor element as instructed.
3. Next, click the "Run Tests" button.
