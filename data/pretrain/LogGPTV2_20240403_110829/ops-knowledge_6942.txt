User: I am using Ansible and Docker for automating the environment build process. I use prompt_vars to try to collect the username and password for the git repo but unfortunately i got this error: 

GetPassWarning: Cannot control echo on the terminal

The docker ubuntu version is 14.04 and python version is 2.7
Assistant: The error

GetPassWarning: Cannot control echo on the terminal

is raised by Python and indicates that the terminal you are using does not provide stdin, stdout and stderr. In this case its stderr.
As there is not much information provided in the question I guess it is tried to use interactive elements like prompt_vars inside a Dockerfile which is IMHO not possible.
