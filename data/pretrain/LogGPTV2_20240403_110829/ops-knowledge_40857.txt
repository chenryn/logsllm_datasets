User: is there a way to use python2.6 with either subprocess.Popen() or os.system() to run two tasks? Example the script will run "airodump-ng" first then this process is sub and is hidden(meaning will not print out from terminal) after which continue run the rest of the script which contain "sniff" function of scapy. I been researched but I only found windows version and python3. By the way I running on debian.
Assistant: In the spot where you put the command airodump-ng replace that part with timeout 'X's airodump-ng mon'X'
