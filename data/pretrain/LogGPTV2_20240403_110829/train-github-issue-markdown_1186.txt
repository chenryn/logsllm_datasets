I think there is a bug in the method predict of the class _PLS. More
specifically, if I choose to scale the dataset during training (scale=True),
then the method "predict" does not seem to reverse the scaling operation:
> return Ypred + self.y_mean_
(line 435 of the source code available at https://github.com/scikit-
learn/scikit-learn/blob/c957249/sklearn/cross_decomposition/pls_.py#L437)
I believe that the we should first reverse the scaling operation in each
column of Ypred (by using the corresponding component of self.y_std_) :
> return Ypred * self.y_std_ + self.y_mean_
Am I missing anything here?
