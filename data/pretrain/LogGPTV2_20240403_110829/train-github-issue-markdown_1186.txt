I believe there is a potential issue in the `predict` method of the `_PLS` class. Specifically, when the dataset is scaled during training (by setting `scale=True`), the `predict` method does not appear to reverse the scaling operation properly.

In the current implementation, the method returns:
```python
return Ypred + self.y_mean_
```
(See line 435 of the source code: [https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/c957249/sklearn/cross_decomposition/pls_.py#L437](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/c957249/sklearn/cross_decomposition/pls_.py#L437))

However, to correctly reverse the scaling, we should first multiply each column of `Ypred` by the corresponding component of `self.y_std_` and then add `self.y_mean_`. The corrected line should be:
```python
return Ypred * self.y_std_ + self.y_mean_
```

Am I missing something here, or does this seem like a valid concern?
