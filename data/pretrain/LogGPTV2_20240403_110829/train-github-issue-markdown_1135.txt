# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
I usually have hundreds and sometimes thousands of files with maybe 10 or 20
different naming variations and I always have to select all files, right
click, open PowerRename, write regex, apply changes, select all files again,
right click, open PowerRename, write regex, apply changes, and repeat, over
and over again.
It would be awesome to have an option to NOT close PowerTools window after
renaming files. After renaming, the window would refresh with the new names,
and let me change once again the parameters with ease.
It is unfeasible to use a single regex (I tried but if left me with a monster
of more than 600 chars) because there are so many different variations and
with every delivery it changes again. There are many different areas that
would appreciate such option.
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
Add a checkbox option to "Keep window open after applying changes" or a
setting under PowerTools settings.
