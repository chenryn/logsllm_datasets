### Summary of the New Feature/Enhancement

I frequently work with hundreds to thousands of files, each with 10 to 20 different naming variations. Currently, I have to repeatedly select all files, right-click, open PowerRename, write a regex, apply the changes, and then repeat the process multiple times. This is both time-consuming and inefficient.

It would be highly beneficial to have an option to keep the PowerRename window open after renaming files. This way, the window would refresh to display the new file names, allowing me to easily adjust the parameters and make further changes without having to reopen the tool each time. 

Using a single regex for all variations is impractical, as it results in a complex and unwieldy expression (often exceeding 600 characters). Additionally, the naming conventions change with each delivery, making a one-size-fits-all solution unfeasible. This feature would greatly enhance the efficiency and usability of PowerRename for various tasks and users.

### Proposed Technical Implementation Details (Optional)

- **Checkbox Option**: Add a checkbox labeled "Keep window open after applying changes" within the PowerRename interface.
- **Settings Option**: Alternatively, include a setting under PowerTools settings to enable this functionality.
