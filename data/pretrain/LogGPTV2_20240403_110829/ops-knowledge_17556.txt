User: I've been using PyDev within Eclipse on my Mac for about two years now. Updated Eclipse today, and suddenly PyDev is completely missing. Tried everything, included a complete uninstall and fresh install, but although PyDev shows up as installed in the menu, it appears nowhere else.
PyDev version: 3.0.0.201311051910
Eclipse: Version: Kepler Service Release 1
Build id: 20130919-0819
I can't open a PyDev perspective, I can't create a new Python file, and I can't open an existing Python file without it just being seen as plain text.
I've got a huge assignment due tonight, help appreciated.

I had to spend lot of time to figure out why it is not working. But ultimately did. Download 2.8.2 zip instead and unzip in dropins folder as shown. Start eclipse with -clean option
