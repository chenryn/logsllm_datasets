User: I have bash shell script which is internally calling python script.I would like to know how long python is taking to execute.I am not allowed to do changes in python script.
Any leads would be helpful thanks in advance.
Assistant: Call the python script with /usr/bin/time script. This allows you to track CPU and wall-clock time of the script.
