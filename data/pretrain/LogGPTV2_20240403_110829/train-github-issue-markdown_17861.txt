Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of your text:

I am using an NVIDIA 1070 GPU with 8GB of memory for running a PyTorch model for inference. When I run the model directly, the GPU memory usage is as shown below:

Next, I loaded the model and used the following code to perform JIT tracing. The GPU memory usage when running the traced model is as follows:

### Issue with C++ API

When I attempt to load the saved JIT-traced model (model.pt) using the PyTorch C++ API, I encounter the following error. Does the C++ API require more GPU memory?

To debug this issue, I used GDB to step through the C++ example. The fault occurs during the `forward()` function call, and the GPU memory usage at that point is as follows:
