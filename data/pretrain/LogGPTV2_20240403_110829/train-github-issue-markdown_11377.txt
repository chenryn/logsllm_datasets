"Put the Like, Info and Delete buttons side-by-side by nesting all three of
them within one
element, then each of them within a
element"
I think the Bootstrap markup "btn-block" from the previous exercise is
redundant. The buttons are supposed to be side by side in this exercise using
the column grid.
I suggest part of the exercise is to remove the "btn-block" class form each
button and tests be written to ensure they are removed. I would like some
feedback about this suggestion before submitting a pull request.
