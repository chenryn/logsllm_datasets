To arrange the Like, Info, and Delete buttons side-by-side, you should nest all three buttons within a single `<div>` element. Each button should then be wrapped in its own `<button>` element.

I believe that the `btn-block` class from Bootstrap, which was used in the previous exercise, is redundant for this task. The goal here is to have the buttons displayed side by side using the column grid system. 

I suggest removing the `btn-block` class from each button and writing tests to ensure that these changes are correctly implemented. Before I submit a pull request, I would appreciate some feedback on this suggestion.
