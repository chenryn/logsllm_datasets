MQPUT1 AppActivityDistList PCF Group Header Structure
If the MQPUT1 function is putting to a distribution list, then the variable parameters include one
AppActivityDistList PCF group. For each of the queues in the distribution list, see “Application Activity
Distribution List PCF Group Header Structure” on page 252. The AppActivityDistList PCF group combines
information from the MQOR, MQPMR, and MQRR structures to identify the objects, and the PUT
parameters , and indicate the result of the PUT operation on each queue. For MQPUT1 operations the
AppActivityDistList group contains some or all of the following parameters (the CompCode, Reason,
ObjectName, and ObjectQMgrName is present if the reason code is MQRC_MULTIPLE_REASONS and the
other parameters is determined by the MQPMO.PutMsgRecFields field):
