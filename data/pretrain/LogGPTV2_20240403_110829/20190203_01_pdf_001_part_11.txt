### Registering a SUSE Host and Adding Java Repositories

To register a SUSE host, use the following commands:

```bash
SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12/x86_64
SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12/x86_64
```

For detailed information on registering a SUSE host, visit:
[https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=7016626](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=7016626)

Next, add the Java repository and update the repository metadata. Note that only OpenJDK (version 1.8) is supported on SLES hosts for Java components. Before using an RPM installer to add Advanced Server or a supporting component that requires Java, use `zypper` to add the necessary repository locations to your system.

Use the following commands to add the repositories:

```bash
zypper addrepo "http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Java:/Factory/SLE_12_SP2/Java:Factory.repo"
zypper addrepo "http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/server:/Kolab:/3.3/SLE_12/server:Kolab:3.3.repo"
zypper refresh
```

### Installing xDB Replication Server Components

After adding the repositories, you can use `zypper` to install the xDB Replication Server components:

```bash
zypper install ppas-xdb*
```

**Note:** Before starting the publication server and subscription server, ensure that the `/etc/hosts` file contains an entry for the host name that associates it with the host IP address. For example, if the IP address is `192.168.187.133` and the host name is `linux-dm8s`, the entry should be:

```plaintext
192.168.187.133 linux-dm8s
```

### Post-Installation Host Environment

On Linux hosts where you installed xDB Replication Server using the graphical user interface or from the command line, you should now have a publication server daemon and a subscription server daemon running on your computer, assuming you chose to install these components. If you installed the xDB RPM package, you must start the publication server and the subscription server based on the instructions in Section 5.2.1 for the publication server and Section 5.3.1 for the subscription server. On Windows systems, the publication server and subscription server run as services named "Publication Service" and "Subscription Service."

The Postgres application menu will contain a new item for the xDB Replication Console. On some Linux systems, you may need to restart the server before you can see the xDB Replication Console choice in the application menu. If the xDB Replication Console choice is still unavailable, you can start it by invoking the script `XDB_HOME/bin/runRepConsole.sh`.

### Post-Installation Files

The following files are created during the installation process and may be needed for configuration:

| File Name                         | Location                                      | Description                                         |

**Notes:**
- `XDB_HOME` is the directory where xDB Replication Server is installed.
- `POSTGRES_HOME` is the home directory of the `postgres` operating system account (e.g., `enterprisedb` for Advanced Server installed in Oracle compatible configuration mode).
- The publication and subscription services startup log files (`edb-xdbpubserver.log` and `edb-xdbsubserver.log`) are not generated for Windows and Mac OS X operating systems.
- `USER_HOME` is the home directory of the operating system account in use.
- The xDB Replication Server version number is represented by `x.x` or `xx` (e.g., `6.2` or `62`).

### Uninstalling xDB Replication Server

Uninstalling xDB Replication Server removes the publication server, the subscription server, the xDB Replication Console, the xDB Replication Server Command Line Interface, and all related configuration files. However, it does not remove any databases used as master nodes, publication databases, or subscription databases.

Before uninstalling, use the xDB Replication Console or the xDB Replication Server Command Line Interface to delete any existing single-master or multi-master replication systems. Otherwise, the control schema objects created in the publication databases or master nodes will remain and must be deleted manually, such as by using an SQL command line utility.

#### Uninstallation Methods

**For Linux:**

1. As the root account, run the `uninstall-xdbreplicationserver` script from the directory where you installed xDB Replication Server:

   ```bash
   $ su root
   Password:
   $ cd /opt/PostgreSQL/EnterpriseDB-xDBReplicationServer
   $ ./uninstall-xdbreplicationserver
   ```

2. Click the "Yes" button to confirm the uninstallation of xDB Replication Server.

3. The "Uninstallation Completed" dialog box will appear when the process is complete. Click the "OK" button.

**For Windows:**

1. From the Windows Control Panel, select "Uninstall a Program."
2. Select the xDB Replication Server product in the list of programs to uninstall or change.
3. Click the "Uninstall/Change" button.
4. Click the "Yes" button to confirm the uninstallation of xDB Replication Server.
5. The "Uninstallation Completed" dialog box will appear when the process is complete. Click the "OK" button.

#### Uninstalling in Text or Unattended Mode

Uninstallation can also be done without the graphical user interface. Here are examples for text and unattended modes:

**Text Mode:**

```bash
$ su root
Password:
$ ./uninstall-xdbreplicationserver --mode text

### Uninstalling the xDB RPM Package

If you installed xDB Replication Server from the RPM package, you can uninstall any xDB component by invoking the `yum remove package_name` command as the root account, where `package_name` is any xDB Replication Server component RPM package listed in Section 3.3.

To remove all xDB Replication Server components, use the following command:

```bash
yum remove ppas-xdb*
```

An example of the removal process is shown below:

```bash
[root@localhost ~]# yum remove ppas-xdb*

### Introduction to the xDB Replication Console

The xDB Replication Console is the graphical user interface used to configure and manage the replication system. The equivalent functionality can also be performed using the xDB Replication Server CLI utility. See Chapter 8 for more information on the xDB Replication Server CLI.

The xDB Replication Console window consists of the following main areas:

- **Menu Bar:** Menus for the replication system components.
- **Tool Bar:** Icons for quick access to dialog boxes.
- **Replication Tree:** Replication system components represented as nodes in an inverted tree.
- **Information Window:** Tabbed window with information about a highlighted node in the replication tree.

**Figure 4-1 - xDB Replication Console window**

The options available on the menu bar and tool bar depend on the node highlighted in the replication tree. Only relevant options for the highlighted node are available.

The content of the information window applies to the highlighted node as well.

### xDB Replication Console Tool Bar

This section describes when various tool bar icons are activated. The operations associated with the tool bar are described in Sections 5.2 and 5.3 for single-master replication and in Section 6.2 for multi-master replication.

**Note:** The publication server must be running to use tools relevant to publications. Similarly, the subscription server must be running to use tools relevant to subscriptions.

#### Refresh

The Refresh icon is always activated. Click the Refresh icon if the replication tree or information window does not display the latest information after performing an operation. Clicking the Refresh icon ensures that the latest information is shown in the replication tree and in the information window.

**Figure 4-2 - Refresh icon**

#### Create Publication

The Create Publication icon is activated when a Publication Database node is highlighted in the replication tree.

**Figure 4-3 - Create Publication icon**

#### Publication Management

The Remove Publication, Add Publication Tables, and Remove Publication Tables icons are activated when a Publication node is highlighted in the replication tree.

**Figure 4-4 - Remove Publication, Add Publication Tables, and Remove Publication Tables icons**

#### Create Subscription

The Create Subscription icon is activated when a Subscription Database node is highlighted in the replication tree.

**Figure 4-5 - Create Subscription icon**

#### Subscription Management

The Remove Subscription, Snapshot, Synchronize, Configure Schedule, and Remove Schedule icons are activated when a Subscription node is highlighted in the replication tree.

**Figure 4-6 - Subscription Management icons**
