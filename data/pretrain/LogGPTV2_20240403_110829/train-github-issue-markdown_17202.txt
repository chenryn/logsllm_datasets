##### Detailed description
I am trying to load a tensorflow model in OpenCV, but it fails on
`populateNet` with:
    dropout/Shape:Shape(Relu_2)
    T:0
    out_type:[ ]
    OpenCV Error: Unspecified error (Unknown layer type Shape in op dropout/Shape) in populateNet, file /build/opencv/src/opencv-3.3.0/modules/dnn/src/tensorflow/tf_importer.cpp, line 883
    terminate called after throwing an instance of 'cv::Exception'
      what():  /build/opencv/src/opencv-3.3.0/modules/dnn/src/tensorflow/tf_importer.cpp:883: error: (-2) Unknown layer type Shape in op dropout/Shape in function populateNet
I think this is related to opencv/opencv_contrib#1241
Are there any plans for supporting `shape` layers?
