### Support and Issue Reporting for TensorFlow

For general support and troubleshooting, please visit Stack Overflow:
- [TensorFlow Tag on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow)

If you need to open a GitHub issue, please follow our guidelines:

1. **Issue Type**: The issue must be a bug, a feature request, or a significant problem with the documentation. For minor documentation fixes, please submit a pull request (PR) instead.
2. **Form Completion**: Fill out the provided form below.
3. **TensorBoard Issues**: If your issue is related to TensorBoard, please report it in the [TensorBoard repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard).

**Policy Rationale**: 
TensorFlow developers focus on issues that benefit the entire community, such as fixing bugs and adding features. Individual support requests are better handled on Stack Overflow, which has a broader community of users who can provide timely assistance. GitHub notifications reach thousands of people, and we want to ensure that they see interesting and relevant problems rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.
