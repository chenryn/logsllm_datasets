Question: "You are reviewing a PowerShell script that is intended to output the properties of issuance policies. The script uses a method to format the display of the distinguished name of an object referred to by the variable $OID. Based on PowerShell syntax and best practices, which of the following options provides the best counterargument to the claim that using `$OID.distinguishedName.ToString()` is the proper way to display the distinguished name?"
 "A": "Using ToString() method is unnecessary because PowerShell automatically calls this method when an object's property is referenced in a string."
 "B": "The distinguishedName property should be accessed directly without a method call, as ToString() may result in loss of data type integrity."
 "C": "The ToString() method is the correct approach for ensuring that the distinguished name is displayed with the appropriate data type formatting."
 "D": "The distinguishedName property is not a string, thus calling ToString() on it will cause a runtime error."
Answer: A
