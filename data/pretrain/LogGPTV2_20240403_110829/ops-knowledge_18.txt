User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Are Anonymized Usernames necessary? Our security manager insists that we should use anonymized usernames.

E.g. for a user named John Doe his username would be 'g74h19' instead of something like 'jdoe'. 

We already have a policy that locks out an account after three invalid logon attempts. So except maybe for making a DOS attack harder I can't see how this would help security - even worse you would no longer be able to see who is who in the logs.

Are there any security recommendations that support anonymized usernames? (link) 

Is anybody here using them?

Assistant: I'm going to approach this from a Windows domain perspective. If I'm an attacker, I don't care what the usernames are. I simply want them. So I'm going to look for a system that doesn't have RestrictAnonymous, or a Windows 2000 system, and I'm going to scan for all the usernames in the domain. Or I'll gain a single valid user account on the domain and then issue said scans. Now I have ALL user accounts to try against. 

Oh and I can scan for groups, too. So I'll look for the really nice ones like Domain Admins or Enterprise Admins or groups which look particularly interesting. And I'll see who are the members of the group in question and look to go after them.

So while anonymizing usernames may seem helpful, I don't think they do much to actually increase security. And they make it harder on end users, support staff, and administrators when troubleshooting a particular set of users' problems.
