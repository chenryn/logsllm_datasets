When we have:
  * embedded formB inside formA
  * validation on both forms defined in yamls
  * validation on formA -> formB include `Valid` constraint
  * eg. fieldA on formB has NotBlank with groups: "groupA" defined
  * we have hardcoded groups `['Default', 'groupA']` in `validation_groups` options on formB
And we want to validate formA (containing formB), the validation group is not
working (NotBlank is not validated). What's odd, when we add same `Valid`
constraint directly in `constraints` option on formA form builder - it's
working as expected ðŸ˜•
I'll provide a reproducible code in a while.
