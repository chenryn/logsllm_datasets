To enhance the user experience, we propose adding an option to maximize a window within the zone it currently occupies. This functionality would be similar to how DisplayFusion handles its version of zones. Instead of holding the Shift key and dragging the window to fill the zone, users could simply click the maximize button on the title bar or double-click the title bar to expand the window to fit the current zone.

Additionally, a hotkey should be provided to allow users to maximize the window in the traditional manner, ignoring the zone boundaries. This combination of features would offer greater flexibility and convenience for managing windows within defined screen areas.
