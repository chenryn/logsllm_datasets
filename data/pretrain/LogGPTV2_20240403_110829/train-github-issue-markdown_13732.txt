Give an option to maximise a window to the zone it is currently in (see
DisplayFusion's handling of their version of zones). So rather than holding
shift and dragging a window to fill a zone, maximising the window via the
title bar button or a double clicking on the title bar would fill the zone.
A hotkey to press to maximise as normal while disregarding zones would go well
with this feature.
