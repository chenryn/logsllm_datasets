# Brief Summary
`celery.utils.iso8601` is historic module which `.parse_iso8601()` can be
replaced by `datetime.datetime.fromisoformat()` as Python 3.7 or above is now
supported.
Suggest deprecate this module and use `datetime.datetime.fromisoformat()`
internally.
# Design
## Architectural Considerations
None
## Proposed Behavior
  * `iso8601` module is still usable before v6.0.0, but with addition of deprecation warning
  * remove `iso8601` module in v6.0.0
  * replace all usage of `parse_iso8601()` in the library by `datetime.datetime.fromisoformat`, with compatibility of Python 3.7 to 3.11
