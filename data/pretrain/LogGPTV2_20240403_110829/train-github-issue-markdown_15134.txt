  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
`` is most often used as a loading spinner. I usually find
it most convenient to style my loading spinners to be sized relative to the
text, for example `1.2em` diameter, so that I don't have to waste time styling
each particular usage. But currently `` only supports a
fixed pixel size.
So would you be willing to make the API (or accept a PR to) support any valid
CSS length value (as a string)?
