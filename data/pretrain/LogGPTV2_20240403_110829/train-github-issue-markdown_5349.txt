by **daz.fuller** :
    When running on a Windows environment (Win7 64bit) the following error is reported:
    2013/06/13 08:22:07 unexpected header line: "21 May 2013\r"
    This appears to be a problem in parse.go in the readLine function where it is only
    expecting "\n" (this appears the case in a couple of other methods as well). 
    I've added a constant at the top of the file on my environment to set the end-of-line
    characters and it appears to be working fine with that change.
    Suggest that the method is modified to handle different end-of-line characters. 
    Alternatively, a request could be raised against the standard libraries to look at a EOL
    constant being added to the "os" package?
