User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题SQL Server 2012 SP1 transaction log getting full? One of my DBs is having a problem with the transaction log filling up. It's set to full recovery and is regularly being backup via maintenance plan. I have a full DB backup every weekend then daily differential backups during the weekday along with the transaction log backup every hour. I checked log truncation status and the current status is LOG_BACKUP. I can clear it out doing a on-demand backup but why isn't it being cleared out with the maintenance plan?

What am I missing?

Assistant: You might need to back up your transaction logs more frequently than hourly if your database has a lot of transactions.  Every 15 minutes isn't uncommon.  I'd suggest editing the maintenance job to run log backups more frequently.  

Also, does the .ldf have enough disk space?  If the physical file is prevented from growing, it'll run out of space even with truncation.
