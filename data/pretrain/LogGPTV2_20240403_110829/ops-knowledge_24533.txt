User: I want to write a program that ssh's into remote boxes and runs jobs there if the remote computer is not actively being used. I'll be logging in as clusterJobRunner@remoteBox, and the other user will be logged in as someLocalUser@remoteBox. 
Is there a way to see if a remote user is actively using the box using either Python or Java?
Assistant: In Java you can execute the users Linux command using Runtime.exec(), grab the standard output and get it into a parsable String.  I don't think there are any OS-independent ways to do this.
