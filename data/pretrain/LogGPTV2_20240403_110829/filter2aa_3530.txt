Sysadmins have to know more than just
their systems to do their jobs well. You have
to understand people, finance, and your
organization’s business to spend its money
wisely and protect it from all sorts of
threats. IT people tend to think of threats
using an preparation/attack/response
framework, even when the threats are not
malicious. You can then compare risks and
allocate resources rationally. If threats can
affect your systems, your users, or their
data, they should be on your mind, even if
most of the responsibility rests on some-
one else.
So why not think about legal processes in the
same way? Some resemble existing attacks (hav-
ing your systems seized is like a DOS attack),
whereas others are unique. I’ll discuss search war-
rants, wiretaps, subpoenas, and discovery orders
and their effects on users, systems, and data.
Because this is a signiﬁcantly deeper subject than
can be explained in a small book, let alone a sin-
gle article, I’ll just be glossing over important
nuances to give you an overview of the issues.
This article only discusses U.S. federal law, but
many state laws resemble federal ones. This isn’t
legal advice so much as it is the start of a conver-
sation that you can ﬁnish with your IT staff or
legal counsel. Let’s talk about a few threats.
The Search Warrant: Noisy,Disruptive,and
Potentially Destructive
A search warrant execution to an IT defender is
like an invasion and a DOS attack wrapped up
together. Law enforcement ofﬁcers (LEOs) enter
the area with enough strength to control the area
and to prevent evidence or people of interest from
leaving. Intimidation is a second beneﬁt to such
overwhelming force—scared people often
unknowingly waive their rights.
A search warrant is a legal document issued by a
neutral judicial ofﬁcer such as a judge and speci-
ﬁes both the area to be searched and what is to be
searched for and taken or seized [1]. There are
some speciﬁcs about how the warrant is obtained,
but I’ll not delve into that for two reasons: (1)
they’re rather complex (even to lawyers); (2) you
can’t stop or interfere with a search while it’s being
executed. Your concern should be limited to two
52

potentially conﬂicting interests: preventing disruption to your organiza-
tion, and not waiving your rights.
It helps to focus on the three distinct phases of such a legal attack:
I Pre-attack: Defenses include redundant systems in multiple places,
good backups, and an attorney on retainer who is familiar with your
operations.
I During the attack: Either be quiet or helpful. Protect your rights. Don’t
interfere.
I Post-attack cleanup: Transfer over to untouched systems and restore
from backups. Attack the warrant and ﬁle suit for damages and/or
return of equipment or data.
During the Search
LEOs with a warrant to search and seize electronic evidence have some
discretion about the execution. They can take copies of the evidence,
media, or entire systems that they believe contain what they’re looking for
[2]. Although letting them take forensic copies of your systems may be
annoying, wholesale removal of several servers is far worse. There’s an
obvious temptation to assist the LEOs so that they don’t feel the need to
truck your entire server room back to their ofﬁce. Generally, I’d recom-
mend keeping the conversation to a minimum, both to stay safe and to
prevent expansion of the scope of the search. LEOs can expand the search
if you grant permission, which you may do during the course of the dis-
cussion. You may also unintentionally admit knowledge of or control over
evidence, which may make you “of interest” to the LEOs. That’s not a good
thing. Ever.
Imagine the following hypothetical situation: An LEO arrives with a war-
rant to search system A1 for Alice’s email. Bob is the sysadmin for A1 and
A2. The LEO, while debating on whether or not to put A1 on a hand
truck, asks Bob if he can look at Alice’s ﬁles on A2 or Abe’s ﬁles on A1. If
Bob doesn’t clearly say no, the LEO may start looking. Or, imagine that the
LEO’s warrant includes A3, a system on which only Alice has a login. If
Bob, attempting to be helpful, knows Alice’s password on A3 and gives it
to the LEO, he’s now opened himself up to possessing whatever is on A3.
I want to end this section with two ﬁnal ideas of what to do during the
search. First off, do not interfere with the search. Such behavior may subject
you to several criminal charges, in addition to charges related to whatever
the search was about. Second, have a witness or two available to watch.
You may want an additional person who can say what happened during the
search, in case your recollection disagrees with the LEO’s.
After the Search
If you have good backups or alternate sites, you can recover or cut over,
minimizing your total outage. If the LEO took any systems, your lawyer
can sue for their return [3] and also attempt to exclude the evidence from
trial if there’s a ﬂaw in the search warrant (evidence gained from a incor-
rectly obtained or executed warrant can be suppressed prior to its admis-
sion in court).

Wiretaps
IF YOU’RE THE TARGET
The attack proﬁle: Quiet and incriminating.
I Pre-attack: Defenses include point–to–point encryption under your
control.
I During the attack: There’s no defense. If the wiretapping is done cor-
rectly, you won’t know until it’s too late.
I Post-attack cleanup: Suppress the evidence in court.
Wiretaps aren’t just for phones any more. LEOs may intercept IP trafﬁc
with a valid wiretap warrant or with the permission of the intended recipi-
ent [4]. I’m not going to discuss Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act
(FISA [5) wiretaps because I think that’s still a moving target. I hope it will
be rare for readers to be the target of a regular LEO wiretap (also known as
a Title III [6]), but I think it’s helpful to understand them.
An LEO with a warrant can request that a wiretap be placed somewhere on
a network where it can acquire all the trafﬁc sent and received from the
target, without the target’s knowledge. It is unlawful for the wiretap to
acquire “innocent” trafﬁc, and this responsibility falls to the provider of
the network, not the LEO. Encryption can shield the communications as
long as it takes to decrypt the trafﬁc or acquire the key. If the service
provider has the key, the service provider can be forced to divulge it with a
court order. Although the key may be acquired with a search warrant or
subpoena, at least the target is informed of the lack of privacy.
IF YOU’RE THE PROVIDER OF THE SERVICE
The attack proﬁle: Confusion, stress, and expense.
I Pre-attack: Defenses include the ability to carve out trafﬁc to any host
or user.
I During the attack: Have network staff ready to assist the LEO.
Providers of electronic communication services must accommodate valid
wiretap warrants, allowing LEOs to remotely acquire targeted trafﬁc while
ignoring innocent trafﬁc [7]. The provider must carve out any requested IP
trafﬁc or communications and forward them to law enforcement. If the
provider encrypts the trafﬁc, it must also decrypt it or make the keys avail-
able as well. There’s some controversy about who is a “provider” under this
legislation, as well as whether or not the wiretap can be remotely activated
without the intervention or knowledge of the provider. But such contro-
versy is the subject of another article.
SUBPOENAS AND DISCOVERY
The attack proﬁle: Slow but invasive.
I Pre-attack: Defenses include a data retention/destruction policy. You
need to be able to search all of your storage for relevant documents.
I During the attack: Work closely with legal representation.
I Post-attack cleanup: Expect repeat requests and be ready to explain
what you did.

Although there are some legal differences between subpoenas and discov-
ery, the two are similar from an IT defender’s point of view. They’re both
legal orders to provide information, and since more information is stored
electronically, you’re going to be asked to help out if your organization is
served with a subpoena or is a party to a lawsuit. Being able to retrieve
information quickly and to honestly claim that you’ve searched all your
ﬁles will make you golden.
First off, a sensible data retention policy is important. Talk to your counsel
about what you have to keep and for how long. Be willing to explain how
backups work in layman’s terms. Once you have a retention policy that
you can live with, follow it. If it says keep data for no longer than three
years, make sure you’ve erased or destroyed older media. This dovetails
into the second half of your pre-attack defenses. Knowing what you have
prevents expensive mistakes.
A short war story is worth recounting here: When I was a backup admin, I
was helping an outside law ﬁrm in searching through our archives. After
searching the backups that I knew about, I gave them all the documents
matching the search terms the form provided. Imagine my surprise when
someone found a crate of DLTs from before my time, but within the scope
of the request. The outside counsel almost had a heart attack. Lucky for
us, the tapes had been stored above a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
machine, and they were all blank. Discovering relevant information later
makes you look dishonest, and hiding it would have made us dishonest.
SUBPOENAS AND DISCOVERY: WHERE THEY DIFFER
Subpoenas do the heavy lifting in legal investigations. Grand juries, regula-
tory agencies, and courts can all issue them. The two basic types of sub-
poenas are Duces Tecum (bring us stuff) and Ad Testiﬁcandum (come and
testify under oath). You can also get one if your organization has informa-
tion necessary to resolve a lawsuit between other people. Dealing with a
subpoena is less disruptive than a search warrant—you usually have a few
days to respond at the minimum. If the request is difﬁcult to comply with,
counsel may be able to narrow the scope to make it easier. (Don’t you wish
you could do that with your other projects?) Unfortunately, not too much
is protected from a subpoena other than trade secrets and some client-
attorney communications (for example, Rule 45 of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure protects trade secrets and communications normally under
some privilege). As long as it isn’t abusive, overly burdensome, or not
likely to lead to relevant evidence, it may have to be brought to the issuer.
Discovery entails sharing of relevant information between parties. Simply
put, if you are in a lawsuit, you have to give the other side any information
(discovery) you have that may help your adversary’s case. You also have a
duty to preserve any of that information when litigation becomes likely. So
does your adversary. The only relevant information that you can withhold
are some attorney-related ﬁles. Under the new Federal Rules of Civil Pro-
cedure, litigants must either hand over discovery that is in electronic stor-
age or divulge the nature and location of that discovery fairly soon after
the lawsuit is ﬁled [8].

WORKING CLOSELY WITH YOUR LEGAL COUNSEL
When your organization has been served with a subpoena or discovery
request, someone has to collect all the information that “responds” to the
request. You’ll be collecting a lot of it, and counsel will be reviewing it to
see whether it’s responsive. Your lawyers will be pulling long hours looking
through each ﬁle you bring them. They’ll need help with viewing, sorting,
and interpreting the mountain of data. This may require them to hire temp
workers or to export the ﬁles to their outside law ﬁrm. Being helpful here
will let your organization save money and effort.
You may be called on to explain what you did in collecting the informa-
tion, either to opposing counsel or at a grand jury or trial. If this is a dis-
covery request, there are a few additional ways you can help. First, you can
identify information that you hold that is very time-consuming or expen-
sive to deliver, such as data on obsolete or failing media [9]. Counsel can
go back to the court and exclude or reduce the amount of such discovery.
Conclusion
In closing, knowing what I just told you might allow you to be proactive
when dealing with your organization’s legal department, instead of waiting
for the lawyers to come and impose difﬁcult rules upon you. Let them
know that you want to coordinate defenses and protect your users and the
organization as a whole. They may be pleasantly surprised.
