The packet has been discarded. This should not occur in normal operation. If this occurs with a Multilink over Virtual Private Dialup Network VPDN bundle including Multichassis Multilink it means there is most likely an invalid route in the routing table which is causing packets sent by Multilink over the VPDN tunnel to the Network Access Server NAS/Link Access Concentrator LAC to be erroneously switched back through the multilink bundle interface. If this occurs with a bundle which does not contain any VPDN tunneled sessions it means there is most likely a defect in the driver for one or more of the member links."
