Assistant: This log chunk shows the QuorumCnxManager software component attempting to establish connections with other nodes. The SendWorker and RecvWorker threads are leaving and being interrupted, and connection requests are being received from various IP addresses. The connection attempts are ultimately unsuccessful, as indicated by the "Connection broken" messages.
