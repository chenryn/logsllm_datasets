    [wasp-os](https://github.com/daniel-thompson/wasp-os) is an open source
    firmware for smart watches that are based on the nRF52 family of
    microcontrollers. Fully supported by [gadgetbridge](gadgetbridge.md),
    Wasp-os features full heart rate monitoring and step counting support
    together with multiple clock faces, a stopwatch, an alarm clock,
    a countdown timer, a calculator and lots of other games and utilities.
    All of this, and still with access to the MicroPython REPL for
    interactive tweaking, development and testing.
    One of the supported devices, the [Colmi
    P8](https://wasp-os.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#colmi-p8),
    looks really good.

## [Sleep](sleep.md)
* New: [Explain the sleep cycle.](sleep.md#the-sleep-cycle)
    Humans cycle through two types of sleep in a regular pattern throughout the
    night with a period of 90 minutes. They were called non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid
    eye movement (REM).
    I answer the questions:
    * What is the period of the REM/NREM cycle?
    * What happens to your body in REM and NREM phases?
    * How does the ratio of REM/NREM changes throughout the night? with
        a possible explanation.
    * Why sleeping 6 hours can make you loose up to 90% of your REM or NREM phases?
* New: [Explain sleeping time and sense distortions.](sleep.md#sleeping-time-and-sense-distortions)
    Answer the questions:
    * Why time feels longer in our dreams?
    * How do we loose awareness of the outside world when sleeping?
# [Activism](diversity.md)
* New: Define Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.
    * *Diversity* is the representation and acknowledgement of the multitudes of
        identities, experiences, and ways of moving through the world. This
        includes—but is not limited to—ability, age, citizenship status, criminal
        record and/or incarceration, educational attainment, ethnicity, gender,
        geographical location, language, nationality, political affiliation,
        religion, race, sexuality, socioeconomic status, and veteran status.
        Further, we recognize that each individual's experience is informed by
        intersections across multiple identities.
    * *Equity*  seeks to ensure respect and equal opportunity for all, using all
        resources and tools to elevate the voices of under-represented and/or
        disadvantaged groups.
    * *Inclusion* is fostering an environment in which people of all identities are
        welcome, valued, and supported. An inclusive organization solicits, listens
        to, learns from, and acts on the contributions of all its stakeholders.
# Operative Systems
## Linux
### [ActivityWatch](activitywatch.md)
* New: Introduce ActivityWatch tracking software.
    It's a web application that can be installed both in Linux and Android
    that automatically tracks where you spend the time on.
    Super interesting for life logging and automating stuff. Until I save
    some time to react on the data, I'll just gather it and see how to
    aggregate it.
* Improvement: Add week insights.
    * [The browser watcher is not very accurate](https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-watcher-web/issues/20).
    * The vim editor watcher doesn't add [git branch information](https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-watcher-vim/issues/19).
    * Syncing data between devices [is not yet supported](https://github.com/ActivityWatch/activitywatch/issues/35).
### [Tabs vs Buffers](vim_tabs.md)
* New: Explain how to use tabs, buffers and windows in vim.
### [Vim Plugins](vim_plugins.md)
* New: [Follow the issue to add elipsis instead of ... in vim-abolish.](vim_plugins.md#issues)
* Correction: Forget to use abolish to insert the elipsis symbol.
    Tpope said that it's not going to happen.
* New: Introduce vim-easymotion.
    EasyMotion provides a much simpler way to use some motions in vim. It takes the
    `` out of `w` or `f{char}` by highlighting all possible
    choices and allowing you to press one key to jump directly to the target.
    When one of the available motions is triggered, all visible text preceding or
    following the cursor is faded, and motion targets are highlighted.
* Reorganization: Move vim-test to the plugins page.
### [elasticsearch](elasticsearch.md)
* New: Explain how to reindex an index.
### [mkdocs](mkdocs.md)
* New: Document the Navigation object and the on_nav event.
    Useful if you develop MkDocs plugins, it holds the information to build
    the navigation of the site.
* New: Describe navigation objects used in plugins.
    Explain how to use the [Page](mkdocs.md#page),
    [Section](mkdocs.md#section), and [SectionPage](mkdocs.md#sectionpage) objects.
* Correction: You need to edit the nav in the on_nav and not in the on_files event.
    Even though it seems more easy to create the nav structure in the
    [`on_files`](#on_files) event, by editing the `nav` dictionary of the `config`
    object, there is no way of returning the `config` object in that event, so we're
    forced to do it in this event.
* Correction: [Explain how to add files through a plugin.](mkdocs.md#adding-new-files)
    Long story short, use the `on_config` event instead of `on_files` and
    `on_nav` if you need to add files and want to change the navigation
    menu.
* New: Explain how to use MermaidJS diagrams.
* New: Explain how to test mkdocs plugins.
* New: [Explain additions of version 7.1.0 of the material theme.](mkdocs.md#material-theme-customizations)
    * [Dark-light mode switch](mkdocs.md#color-palette-toggle).
    * [Back to top button](mkdocs.md#back-to-top-button).
### [Peek](peek.md)
* New: Introduce Peek the screen recorder.
    [Peek](https://github.com/phw/peek) is a simple animated GIF screen recorder
    with an easy to use interface.
    If you try to use it with i3, you're going to have a bad time, you'd
    [need to
    install](https://github.com/phw/peek#on-i3-the-recording-area-is-all-black-how-can-i-record-anything)
    [Compton](https://github.com/chjj/compton), and then the elements [may
    not even be
    clickable](https://github.com/phw/peek#why-cant-i-interact-with-the-ui-elements-inside-the-recording-area).
### [Syncthing](syncthing.md)
* Improvement: Mention privacy configurations.
    Disable the [Global
    Discovery](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/security.html#global-discovery)
    and [Relaying
    connections](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/security.html#relay-connections)
    options.
### [Vim](vim.md)
* New: Add vim landing page.
## Android
### [Signal](signal.md)
* New: Introduce the messaging app and how to decrypt the backups.
# Arts
## Writing
### [Grammar and Orthography](orthography.md)
* Improvement: Expand the introduction and add Dave's suggested link.
* New: [Explain where to add your pronouns.](orthography.md#where-to-add-your-pronouns)
    > Hi, I’m Lyz (he/him), I'm writing to tell you…
* New: [Explain when to capitalize after a question mark.](orthography.md#when-to-capitalize-after-a-question-mark)
    If the sentence ends after the question mark you should capitalize, if it
    doesn't end, you shouldn't have used the question mark, since it ends
    a sentence.
* New: Add textstat tests.
    To analyze the text readability
* New: [Explain how to use the singular `they`.](orthography.md#how-to-use-the-singular-they)
### [Writing Style](writing_style.md)
* New: [Analyze interesting books on writing style.](writing_style.md#writing-style-books)
    * The elements of style by William Strunk Jr and E.B White
    * On writing well by William Zinsser
    * Bird by bird by Anne Lamott
    * On writing by Stephen King
* New: [Explain how to end a letter.](writing_style.md#how-to-end-a-letter)
    Use Sincerely in doubt and Best if you have more confidence. Add a comma
    after the sign-off and *never* use Cheers (it's what I've been doing all
    my life `(◞‸◟；)` ).
## [Origami](origami.md)
* New: Add mark1626 digital garden article on origamis.
# Other
* New: Introduce Outrun.
    [Outrun](https://github.com/Overv/outrun) lets you execute a local command using
    the processing power of another Linux machine.
* New: Introduce the media system and monitor interesting issues.
    [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) is a Free Software Media System that puts you
    in control of managing and streaming your media. It is an alternative to the
    proprietary Emby and Plex, to provide media from a dedicated server to end-user
    devices via multiple apps. Jellyfin is descended from Emby's 3.5.2 release and
    ported to the .NET Core framework to enable full cross-platform support. There
    are no strings attached, no premium licenses or features, and no hidden agendas:
    just a team who want to build something better and work together to achieve it.
