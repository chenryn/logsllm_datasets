  * Electron version: Latest
  * Operating system: OSX, Windows
I've been rebuilding the spellchecker for notion.so and I thought I would
compile some of the quirks I ran into.
The de facto solution right now is to use electron-spellchecker and we've been
using it for the past year, but recently the language auto-detect stopped
working on Mac. Probably a recent OS update or something. Slack has language
select in their settings menu so I'd imagine fixing this issue isn't such a
high priority for them (I believe the maintainer works there ;).
So I went about building my own solution that uses node-cld to detect the
language on `selectionchange` events and node-spellchecker to access native
spellcheck APIs on MacOS and Window 8+. Here are some feature requests:
  * Async `webFrame.setSpellCheckProvider` #10734 \-- if we could throttle spellcheck to wait for users to stop typing, there would be a lot less jank and feel a lot more performant.
  * `webFrame.checkSpelling(elm: HTMLElement)` \-- currently, a user has to move their selection through an editable element before the spellchecker will run. It would be nice if we could trigger this manually.
  * `webContents.replaceMisspelling` doesn't remove misspelling underline -- The `webFrame.checkSpelling` API could be a simple workaround to fix this.
  * Multi-language support is not quite possible because the `webFrame.setSpellCheckProvider` API only lets you check one word at a time. Thus you cannot have multiple languages in the same input because it needs to decide on only one language. One solution is for the API to pass the entire textContent and return a list of selections that are misspelled.
  * Tangentially related: `node-spellchecker` has `Add to Dictionary` and `Remove from Dictionary` support, but it doesn't have `isAddedToDictionary` so its hard to know when to show the `Remove from Dictionary` option in the context menu.
Finally, I just want to highlight how good the Google Chrome spellchecker is.
It handles language detection with multiple languages in the same input. Its
asynchronous and non-blocking. It has all the native dictionary support. If we
were able to pull the Google Chrome spellchecker into Chromium, then all the
Electron-based note taking apps and email clients would benefit greatly. #3211
