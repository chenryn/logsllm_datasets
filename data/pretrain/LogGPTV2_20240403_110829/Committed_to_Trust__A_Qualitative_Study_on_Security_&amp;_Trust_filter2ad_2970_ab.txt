pull requests [44]–[46]. Recently published work investigated
repository artifacts such as programming languages [47],
maintenance [48], [49], toxicity in comments [50], and related
metadata [51], [52].
Unlike previous research focusing on repositories, we are
more interested in aspects that are not directly visible on
a repository level: trust processes, contributor hierarchy, and
security considerations.

Interview Studies in a Security Context: Interview studies
are a well-established research approach for in-depth investiga-
tions in the (security and privacy) research community. In the
past, research has utilized interviews to gain insights into the
work and tools of experts such as security professionals [53],
[54], administrators [55], [56], and security analysts [57].
Interviews were also conducted to establish the security needs
of expert communities such as journalists [58], editors [59],
and victim service providers [60]. As part of larger stud-
ies, interviews allow insights into specific mindsets and ap-
proaches, e. g., for encryption tasks [61] or Tor usage [62].
More recently, Gutfleisch et al. interviewed developers about
security feature considerations in their software development
process [63]. In the context of OSS and communities, Dab-
bish et al. examined the value of transparency for large-
scale distributed collaborations and communities of practice
in interviews [39]. As part of a larger study, Steinmacher et
al. conducted semi-structured interviews with 36 developers
from 14 different projects, identifying social barriers faced by
first-time contributors [64]. Balali et al. interviewed mentors
of 10 OSS projects, identifying both challenges and strategies
related to recommending tasks for newcomers [65].
Similarly, we also decided on in-depth interviews for our
research approach to gain detailed insights into participants’
perceptions, behaviors, and reasoning.
Security and Trust in the Open Source Community: The
open source community faces unique security and trust chal-
lenges compared to other ecosystems, making them a valuable
subject for research [66]–[68]. Issues and commits are impor-
tant structural features in the open source community, enabling
evaluations of general statistics [69], security tactics [70], and
emotions [71]. Antal et al. investigated commits of Python and
JavaScript projects, finding that neither community reacts very
fast to emerging security vulnerabilities in general [72]. Bosu
et al. analyzed 267,046 code review requests from 10 open
source projects, finding that
less experienced contributors’
changes were 1.8 to 24 times more likely to be vulnerable [73].
Published identification systems for open source projects in-
clude vulnerabilities [74]–[76] and toxic comments [77]. Trust
is an important factor in public software collaboration. Re-
search directions include trustworthiness measurements [78],
[79] and factors influencing trust [45], [80], [81]. In line with
our findings, prior research established (quality of) contri-
butions, reputation, and employing organization as important
trust factors. Code quality is an important factor for security
in open source projects, with previous research investigating
aspects such as code reviews [82], [83], quality assessment
models [84], and discrepancies between vision and actual
implementation [85]. Due to their important role in the open
source ecosystem, committers are the focus of multiple works,
e. g., for their pull requests [86],
their motivations [87]–
[90], or contribution barriers [64], [91]. Other works propose
supporting aspects such as approaches for onboarding [65],
[92]–[94] and mentoring [65], [95]. Blincoe et al. proposed
a new method, reference coupling, for detecting technical
dependencies between projects, finding that most ecosystems
are centered around one project and are interconnected with
other ecosystems [96]. Casalnuovo et al. explored the evidence
for socialization as a precursor to joining GitHub projects,
finding developers preferentially join projects where they have
pre-existing relationships [97].
While our work utilizes certain repository artifacts to enrich
our research, our focus is more on in-depth details from 27 in-
terviews with contributors, maintainers, and project owners.
Like previous research, we consider the open source ecosystem
to be of major importance to the overall software world and
hope to leverage 27 in-depth interviews as first steps towards
supporting committers and maintainers in creating secure and
trustworthy projects.
III. METHODOLOGY
In this section, we provide an overview of our study
approach and the structure of the semi-structured interviews.
We also detail the qualitative coding process, report on our
data collection and ethical considerations, and discuss the
limitations of our work.
A. Study Setup
To gain insights into the inner workings of open source
projects, we conducted semi-structured interviews (n = 27)
with contributors, maintainers, and owners of open source
projects between July and November 2021. We decided on
in-depth interviews as our research approach, as we were
especially interested in processes that are often not directly
visible from the repository data, e. g.,
trust relationships,
incident responses, and the handling of suspicious or malicious
contributors.
Interview Guide: We based the initial interview guide on our
exploratory research questions. We also considered concepts
investigated in previous related work and adapted them to
our more in-depth interview approach. To establish additional
areas of research and for feedback, we consulted and piloted
the interview guide with open source contributors from our
professional network. For the participants’ convenience, we
created both English and German versions of the interview
guide, keeping both in sync during the study. During the
study process, we continually iterated the interview guide
based on the conducted interviews and the collected participant
feedback. Changes were limited to the addition of a few
follow-up questions and minor structural modifications, reach-
ing saturation without any changes past the 15th interview. Our
full interview guides in English and German are included in
the replication package (cf. Section I-A).
Recruitment and Inclusion Criteria: We based our recruit-
ment approach around reaching as many diverse OSS projects
as possible. We decided on utilizing multiple recruitment
channels to better reach a diverse set of projects from different
historical and structural contexts: via our professional network,
project- or technology-associated communication channels
such as mailing lists, Discord instances, or IRC servers, as
well as via contact details on public repository websites like
