### Pull Requests and Repository Artifacts

Recent studies have examined various repository artifacts, including programming languages [47], maintenance practices [48, 49], toxicity in comments [50], and related metadata [51, 52]. Unlike previous research that has focused on these visible aspects of repositories, our study delves into less overt dimensions such as trust processes, contributor hierarchy, and security considerations.

### Interview Studies in a Security Context

Interview studies are a well-established method for in-depth investigations within the security and privacy research community. Past research has utilized interviews to gain insights into the work and tools of security professionals [53, 54], administrators [55, 56], and security analysts [57]. Interviews have also been used to understand the security needs of expert communities, such as journalists [58], editors [59], and victim service providers [60]. In broader studies, interviews provide detailed insights into specific mindsets and approaches, such as encryption tasks [61] and Tor usage [62].

More recently, Gutfleisch et al. [63] interviewed developers about their considerations regarding security features in software development. Dabbish et al. [39] explored the value of transparency in large-scale distributed collaborations through interviews. Steinmacher et al. [64] conducted semi-structured interviews with 36 developers from 14 different projects to identify social barriers faced by first-time contributors. Balali et al. [65] interviewed mentors from 10 OSS projects to uncover challenges and strategies for recommending tasks to newcomers.

In line with these approaches, we chose in-depth interviews to gain detailed insights into participants' perceptions, behaviors, and reasoning.

### Security and Trust in the Open Source Community

The open source community faces unique security and trust challenges compared to other ecosystems, making it a valuable subject for research [66–68]. Key structural features, such as issues and commits, enable evaluations of general statistics [69], security tactics [70], and emotions [71]. Antal et al. [72] found that neither the Python nor JavaScript communities react quickly to emerging security vulnerabilities. Bosu et al. [73] analyzed 267,046 code review requests from 10 open source projects and discovered that changes made by less experienced contributors were 1.8 to 24 times more likely to be vulnerable.

Published identification systems for open source projects include those for vulnerabilities [74–76] and toxic comments [77]. Trust is a critical factor in public software collaboration. Research directions include measuring trustworthiness [78, 79] and identifying factors that influence trust [45, 80, 81]. Previous studies have established that the quality of contributions, reputation, and the employing organization are important trust factors. Code quality is crucial for security in open source projects, with research focusing on aspects like code reviews [82, 83], quality assessment models [84], and discrepancies between vision and implementation [85].

Committers play a significant role in the open source ecosystem, and several studies have focused on their pull requests [86], motivations [87–90], and contribution barriers [64, 91]. Other works propose supporting aspects such as onboarding [65, 92–94] and mentoring [65, 95]. Blincoe et al. [96] introduced a new method, reference coupling, to detect technical dependencies between projects, finding that most ecosystems center around one project and interconnect with others. Casalnuovo et al. [97] explored the evidence for socialization as a precursor to joining GitHub projects, noting that developers prefer to join projects where they have pre-existing relationships.

While our research utilizes certain repository artifacts, our primary focus is on in-depth details from 27 interviews with contributors, maintainers, and project owners. Like previous research, we recognize the importance of the open source ecosystem to the overall software world and aim to use these interviews as a foundation for supporting committers and maintainers in creating secure and trustworthy projects.

### Methodology

#### Study Setup

To gain insights into the inner workings of open source projects, we conducted semi-structured interviews (n = 27) with contributors, maintainers, and project owners between July and November 2021. We chose in-depth interviews because we were particularly interested in processes that are not directly visible from repository data, such as trust relationships, incident responses, and the handling of suspicious or malicious contributors.

**Interview Guide:**
- The initial interview guide was based on our exploratory research questions and concepts from previous related work.
- We consulted and piloted the interview guide with open source contributors from our professional network.
- Both English and German versions of the interview guide were created and kept in sync during the study.
- The interview guide was iteratively refined based on feedback and conducted interviews, reaching saturation after the 15th interview.

**Recruitment and Inclusion Criteria:**
- Our recruitment approach aimed to reach a diverse set of OSS projects from different historical and structural contexts.
- We used multiple recruitment channels, including our professional network, project- or technology-associated communication channels (mailing lists, Discord, IRC), and contact details on public repository websites.
