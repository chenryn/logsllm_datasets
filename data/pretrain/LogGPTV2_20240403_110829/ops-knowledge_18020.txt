User: Please list common database optimization strategies and measures.
Assistant: 1. Database design optimization: A good database design can avoid redundant data and complex queries, and improve the performance and reliability of the database. 2. Database index optimization: Indexes can speed up query, sort and join operations. Creating indexes on frequently used columns and tables, and regularly updating the indexes can improve the performance of the database. 3. Database query optimization: Reasonable query design and optimization can reduce query time and computing resources, including selecting appropriate query statements, reducing the use of subqueries, and avoiding full table scans as much as possible. 4. Database cache optimization: Using cache technology can reduce the number of database accesses and improve system performance. Applications can use local cache, in-memory cache, or database cache, etc. 5. Database partition optimization: When the amount of data is large, the use of partition technology can speed up the query and improve system performance. Common partitioning techniques include horizontal partitioning and vertical partitioning. 6. Database connection pool optimization: The connection pool can improve the efficiency and reliability of database connections, avoiding frequent establishment and closure of database connections. 7. Optimization of database compression technology: Compression technology can reduce database storage space and improve storage and transmission efficiency. Common compression techniques include compressed tables, compressed indexes, and compressed backups. 8. Database backup and recovery optimization: Reasonable data backup and recovery strategies can avoid data loss and system failure, including data backup frequency, backup type, backup storage, etc. 9. Database security optimization: Adopting appropriate database security policies can improve the security and reliability of the database, including access control, encryption technology, audit trail, etc. 10. Database performance monitoring and tuning: Real-time monitoring of database performance parameters and bottlenecks can detect and solve problems in a timely manner, improving database performance and reliability. Common performance monitoring tools include AWR report, Explain Plan, etc.
