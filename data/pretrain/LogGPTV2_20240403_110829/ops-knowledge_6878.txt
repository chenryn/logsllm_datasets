User: When my Python script is writing a large amount of logs to a text file line by line using the Python built-in logging library, in my Delphi-powered Windows program I want to effectively read all newly added logs (lines).

When the Python scripting is logging
to the file, my Windows program will
keep a readonly file handle to
that log file;
I'll use the Windows API to get
informed when the log file is
changed; Once the file is changed, it'll read the newly appended lines. 

I'm new to Python, do you see any possible problem with this approach? Does the Python logging lib lock the entire log? Thanks!
Assistant: As ʇsәɹoɈ commented, the standard FileHandler logger does not lock the file, so it should work. However, if for some reason you cannot keep you lock on the file - then I'd recommend having your other app open the file periodically, record the position it's read to and then seek back to that point later. I know the Linux DenyHosts program uses this approach when dealing with log files that it has to monitor for a long period of time. In those situations, simply holding a lock isn't feasible, since directories may move, the file get rotated out, etc. Though it does complicate things in that then you have to store filename + read position in persistent state somewhere.
