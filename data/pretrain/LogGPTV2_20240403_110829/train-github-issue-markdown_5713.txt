### Filtering Currently Running Applications

Since the integration with Wox, the Window Walker feature of PTRun has become less efficient. New applications and other search results now often take precedence over currently running applications. For example, I used to rely on Window Walker to search through open browser tabs, but this is no longer practical due to the large number of results returned by PTRun, making the process cumbersome and inefficient.

To address this issue, could an option be added to allow PTRun to display only currently running applications? This could be implemented in a few ways:
- **Specific Shortcut:** A dedicated shortcut that opens PTRun and limits the search to currently running applications.
- **Search Filter Character:** A special character (e.g., `:`) that, when included in the search query, filters the results to show only running applications. This would be similar to how `>` is used for terminal commands.

I believe many previous users of Window Walker would find this feature beneficial.

Thank you for your consideration!
