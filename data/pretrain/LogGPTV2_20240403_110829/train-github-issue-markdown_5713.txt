# Filter Currently Running Applications
Since the merge with Wox, the Window Walker aspect of PTRun has become much
less efficient, as opening new applications and other search results often
take priority over applications that are currently running. For instance, I
used to use Window Walker to search through open browser tabs, but this isn't
really feasible anymore as PTRun returns too many results upon search to be
easy or efficient.
To that end, would it be possible to somehow set an option so that PTRun only
displays currently running applications? Perhaps with a specific shortcut that
opens PTRun to only look at open applications? Or a character in the search to
set as a filter (like ">" is a terminal run, maybe ":" only returns running
applications)?
I think a lot of previous users of Window Walker would benefit.
Many Thanks for your consideration!
