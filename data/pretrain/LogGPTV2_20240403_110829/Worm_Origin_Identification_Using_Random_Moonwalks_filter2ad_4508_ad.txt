reason is that when random moonwalks start from lower

We will further address the impact of parameters (cid:1) and the
sampling window size (cid:0) on performance using real-world
traces in Section 7.4.
7 Real Trace Study
In this section, we present our experimental results using
real world traces collected from a university network. The
objective of the trace based study was to both test the effec-
tiveness of our algorithm using real trafﬁc and to study the
performance of the algorithm in different attack scenarios.
As our analytical study argues the effectiveness of the algo-
rithm for fast propagating attacks, we focus the real trace
study on stealthy attacks that generate low trafﬁc volumes
that might escape traditional scanner and super-spreader de-
tection mechanisms.
The trafﬁc trace was collected over a four hour period
at the backbone of a class-B university network, where we
can observe a signiﬁcant fraction of the intra-campus net-
work trafﬁc. Each record in the trace corresponds to a di-
rectional ﬂow between two hosts with timestamps. We ex-
cluded ﬂow records between campus hosts and non-campus
hosts to study the performance of our technique on worm
propagation inside an intranet. The resulting trace has about
1.4 million ﬂows involving 8040 campus hosts.
With the four hour trace serving as real-world back-
ground trafﬁc, we add ﬂow records to the trace that rep-
resent worm-like trafﬁc with varying scanning rates. We
vary the fraction of vulnerable hosts (cid:5) , by randomly select-
ing the desired fraction of hosts from the set of 8040 total
internal hosts. For the following experiments, except Sec-
tion 7.7, we choose (cid:5) (cid:0) (cid:4)(cid:6)(cid:1). Each worm outbreak starts
roughly 2800 seconds into the trace, and lasts for 8000 sec-
onds. Once a host is infected, it generates one attack ﬂow
every  seconds to a randomly selected destination from
among the 8040 hosts. In the real trace, 90% of the hosts
send fewer than one ﬂow every 20 seconds. To describe how
aggressive a worm is, we deﬁne the normalized worm rate
as the ratio of the rate an infected host sends attack ﬂows to
the 90 percentile of the normal connection rate (e.g., a worm
sending one ﬂow per 20 second has a normalized worm rate
of 1, and a worm sending one ﬂow every 200 seconds has
a normalized rate of 0.1). Figure 10 lists the characteristics
of the worms we introduced to the real world trace. We use
“Trace-(cid:7)” to refer a trace with worm rate of one attack ﬂow
per (cid:7) seconds.
We introduce two additional metrics to compare the per-
formance across worms of different scanning rates. Given
the set of the top (cid:8) frequency edges after sampling, the de-
tection accuracy of causal edges is the number of causal
edges in the set divided by (cid:8), and the detection accuracy of
attack edges is the number of attack edges in the set divided
by (cid:8).
For each experiment, we use the parameter values se-
lected from Figure 10, and discuss how we compute the op-
timal parameter values in Section 7.4. We repeat each ex-
periment run 5 times with each run consisting of (cid:1)(cid:4)(cid:0) walks
(unless otherwise speciﬁed) and plot the mean of the 5 runs
for the following results.
7.1 Detecting the Existence of an Attack
To determine whether the random moonwalk technique can
detect if an attack is present, (cid:1)(cid:4)(cid:0) random moonwalks were
performed on Trace-10. Figure 11 shows the number of
times each edge was sampled, and the outline of the plot
indicates the count of the most frequently sampled edge for
each second. The dashed lines indicate the actual attack
start time, saturation time, and the attack ﬁnish time. The
ﬁgure shows that edges occurring before and after the at-
tack have a relative evenly distributed sampling frequency.
Edges between time 2700 and 10000 are sampled more fre-
quently, with a peak frequency as high as 800. This strongly
suggests the existence of abnormal structures in the host

contact graph, which may potentially constitute an epidemic
spreading attack.
In particular, the peak of the frequency counts occurring
around 2800 seconds corresponds to the onset of the at-
tack (the worm was introduced at (cid:1)(cid:0) (cid:0) (cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:2)(cid:5)) with initial
causal ﬂows having highest probability of being traversed.
The turning point after the peak (4200 seconds in this case)
corresponds to the attack saturation time when all vulner-
able hosts are infected. Knowledge that an attack is tak-
ing place and the information on precisely when it started
is useful to network operators, and could be used to focus
resources (such as random moonwalks) on the portions of
the trace that are most likely to yield information about the
attack origin.

Figure 12: Detection accuracy of causal edges and attack
edges vs. number of top frequency edges ((cid:3)) returned for
Trace-10 and Trace-50. Note there are only 800 causal
edges from among approximately (cid:1)(cid:4)(cid:6)-(cid:3)  (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:1) total ﬂows.
We ﬁrst examine the detection accuracy of causal edges
and the size of the suspect set identiﬁed for further inves-
tigation. Figure 12 (a) shows the detection accuracy, vary-
ing the number of top frequency (cid:3) edges, with different
number of walks. First, we observe random moonwalks
achieve high detection accuracy of causal edges, in partic-
ular when (cid:3) is small. Although there are only 800 causal
edges out of the approximately (cid:1)(cid:4)(cid:6)-(cid:3)  (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:1) ﬂows, as high

as 7-8 out of the top 10 ﬂows are causal ﬂows, regardless of
the worm propagating rate. Second, the causal edge accu-
racy decreases sub-linearly as we increase (cid:3), demonstrating
the capability of ﬁnding causal ﬂows beyond the few initial
ones. These edges may additionally reveal the attack prop-
agation paths, and help reconstruct the causal tree. Finally,
increasing the number of walks results in higher causal edge
accuracy in general, but a small number of samples can al-
ready achieve comparable performance when we focus on
the small number of top ﬂows, i.e., when (cid:3) (cid:1) (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2). As
a contrast, we show the detection accuracy of attack edges
in Figure 12 (b). We ﬁnd that as expected the accuracy of
attack edges is fairly high. But a high detection accuracy
of attack edges does not always imply high detection accu-
racy of causal edges. For example, the attack edge accuracy
for Trace-10 increases with larger (cid:3), while the causal edge
detection accuracy decreases. In Section 7.5, we will fur-
ther address the comparison between causal edge and attack
edge accuracies with alternative edge selection strategies.
