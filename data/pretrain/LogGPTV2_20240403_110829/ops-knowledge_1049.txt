User: I am running python 2.7.1.  I can't figure out how to launch the IDLE IDE.  I am told it comes already installed with python, but I can't find it using spotlight.
Assistant: As to the earlier questions about starting IDLE: you can certainly start it from the command line. Also, if you installed Python using Homebrew, you can run 'brew linkapps' (from the command line); that will place an app for IDLE (among other things) in Launchpad (Applications folder).
