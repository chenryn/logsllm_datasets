User: How to build a monitoring and management system for network security incidents, and establish system rules and early warning mechanisms to ensure network security
Assistant: network security event monitoring and management system should include the following steps: 1. Establish security policies: The first step in network security event monitoring and management is to define security policies, which stipulate which behaviors are prohibited and which behaviors are allowed . 2. Implement security measures: Develop and implement network security measures, such as security training, anti-virus software, network firewalls, etc. 3. Network security event monitoring: use network audit tools, network monitoring tools and other network security event monitoring technologies to monitor abnormal network security events. 4. Classification of security events: Security administrators should classify the monitored security events, such as vulnerability scanning results, network attacks, malware, internal leaks, etc. 5. Security incident response: Security administrators need to take different countermeasures according to different categories of security incidents, such as deploying patches, blocking attack sources, and isolating affected hosts. 6. Security event management: Establish a security event management system to track, process and record security events, form a security event report, and report to the security management for analysis. In addition, it is also very important to establish system rules and early warning mechanisms. Behavior rules and transaction strategies can be established based on historical security event data, such as a large number of login failures, abnormal growth of intranet traffic, and system vulnerability attacks. Trigger alerts and send alert messages to security administrators so that appropriate response actions can be taken as soon as possible. At the same time, security administrators should also regularly check and adjust system rules and early warning mechanisms to ensure network security.
