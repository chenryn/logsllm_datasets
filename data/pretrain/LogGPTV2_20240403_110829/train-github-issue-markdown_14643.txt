I upgraded my game to r70 (From r63) and noticed that my torch was not moving
with the camera.
I position the target for the spot light in-front of the camera, but it now
appears I must manually call
this.flashLight.target.updateMatrix() ;
to get the light to follow the new target position.
Was this an intended change? If so please close this issue, but this did work
correctly in r63 and before.
