**Title: Black Hat US-18: Lessons from Virginia - A Comparative Forensic Analysis of WinVote Voting Machines**

The WinVote voting machine was widely used in Virginia elections from 2004 to 2015. It has been labeled as one of the most insecure voting machines ever, and for good reason. The WinVote runs on Windows XP, Service Pack 0, with default Wi-Fi enabled. It uses WEP security, and all WinVote machines appear to share the same password, "abcde." Well-known exploits allow adversaries to gain administrator-level privileges without physical access, and the Remote Desktop Protocol is enabled by default on every machine. These vulnerabilities are well-documented, but the lessons learned extend beyond technical flaws and have broader societal implications.

The most critical aspect of any electoral process is the trust of the voters. Both winners and losers must be convinced of the integrity of the election, so that the outcome is accepted by all. This is a significant challenge, especially given that national elections often occur in highly contested environments where network, hardware, software, and configuration processes can be compromised. The WinVote machine, with its numerous security weaknesses, could serve as an instrument for hackers to influence election results.

In my talk, I will use the WinVote voting machine as a case study to illustrate the threats posed by such machines to democratic processes. I will also outline strategies to achieve credible levels of election security. The key to ensuring the integrity of elections lies in evidence production, which can take the form of paper ballots, cryptographic proofs, multiple result verification paths, or statistical evidence. The WinVote lacks all these safeguards, making it an ideal tool for adversaries to manipulate election outcomes.

This raises the question: Did election interference occur in Virginia during the period when WinVote machines were in use? After these machines were decommissioned in 2015, several were released into the public domain. We obtained a few of these machines and conducted a forensic analysis using standard tools, comparing the contents of their respective drives. Each machine contained two SSD drives: one small (32MB) and one large (either 384MB or 512MB).

At the time of writing this report, no definitive evidence of election tampering has been found. However, we did discover that some WinVote machines were used for purposes other than voting. For example, one machine was used to rip songs from CDs and broadcast MP3s, including a Chinese song from 1995 titled "白雪-千古绝唱.mp3."

Trust in elections cannot be achieved through technology alone; it requires the production and verification of evidence. As of the writing of this proposal, the United States has only about 90 days left to prepare for the 2018 midterm elections. Several states still use voting machines similar to the WinVote, which do not produce any form of verifiable evidence. This situation underscores the urgent need for robust and transparent election security measures.
