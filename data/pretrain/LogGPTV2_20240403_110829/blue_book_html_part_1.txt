[HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) is the standard markup
language for Web pages. With HTML you can create your own Website.
# [Document structure](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp)
All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: ``.
The HTML document itself begins with `` and ends with ``.
The visible part of the HTML document is between `` and ``.
```html
My First Heading
My first paragraph.
```
# HTML elements
* Headings: `` to ``
* Paragraphs: `This is a paragraph.`.
* [Links](#links): `This is a link`
* [Images](#images): ``
* Line breaks: ``, ``
* Comments: ``
* Code: ` x = 5`
## [Links](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp)
HTML links are hyperlinks. You can click on a link and jump to another document.
The HTML `` tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:
```html
link text
```
The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.
Link attributes:
* `href`: indicates the link's destination.
* `target`: specifies where to open the linked document. It can have one of the following values:
    * `_self`: (Default) Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was
        clicked.
    * `_blank`: Opens the document in a new window or tab.
    * `_parent`: Opens the document in the parent frame.
    * `_top`: Opens the document in the full body of the window.
## [Images](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp)
The HTML `` tag is used to embed an image in a web page.
Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web
pages. The `` tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.
The `` tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.
The `` tag has two required attributes:
* `src`: Specifies the path to the image.
* `alt`: Specifies an alternate text for the image shown if the user for some
    reason cannot view it.
```html
```
Other `` attributes are:
* ``: specify the width and height of an image.
    ```html
    ```
    Even though you could use `width` and `height`, if you use the `style`
    attribute you prevent style sheets to change the size of images.
* ``: let the image float to the right or to the left of a text.
    ```html
    The image will float to the right of the text.
    The image will float to the left of the text.
    ```
If you want to use an image as a link use:
```html
```
## [Lists](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists.asp)
HTML lists allow web developers to group a set of related items in lists.
* Unordered lists: starts with the `` tag. Each list item starts with the
    `` tag. The list items will be marked with bullets (small black circles)
    by default:
    ```html
      Coffee
      Tea
      Milk
    ```
* Ordered list: Starts with the `` tag. Each list item starts with the
    `` tag. The list items will be marked with numbers by default:
    ```html
      Coffee
      Tea
      Milk
    ```
## [Tables](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp)
HTML tables allow web developers to arrange data into rows and columns.
```html
    Company
    Contact
    Country
    Alfreds Futterkiste
    Maria Anders
    Germany
    Centro comercial Moctezuma
    Francisco Chang
    Mexico
```
Where:
* ``: Defines the table headers
* ``: Defines the table rows
* ``: Defines the table cells
## [Blocks](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp)
A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers
automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to
the left and right as far as it can).
An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width
as necessary.
* ``: defines a paragraph in an HTML document.
* ``: defines a division or a section in an HTML document. It has
    no required attributes, but style, class and id are common. When used together
    with CSS, the `` element can be used to style blocks of content:
    ```html
      London
      London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.
    ```
* ``: Is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part
    of a document.
    The `` element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are
    common. When used together with CSS, the `` element can be used to style
    parts of the text:
    ```html
    My mother has blue eyes and my father has dark green eyes.
    ```
## [Classes](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_classes.asp)
The `class` attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet.
It can also be used by a JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the
specific class name.
In the following example we have three `` elements with a class attribute
with the value of "city". All of the three `` elements will be styled
equally according to the `.city` style definition in the head section:
```html
  London
  London is the capital of England.
  Paris
  Paris is the capital of France.
  Tokyo
  Tokyo is the capital of Japan.
```
HTML elements can belong to more than one class. To define multiple classes,
separate the class names with a space, e.g. ``. The element
will be styled according to all the classes specified.
## [Javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_scripts.asp)
The HTML `` tag is used to define a client-side script (JavaScript).
The `` element either contains script statements, or it points to an
external script file through the src attribute.
Common uses for JavaScript are image manipulation, form validation, and dynamic
changes of content.
This JavaScript example writes "Hello JavaScript!" into an HTML element with
`id="demo"`:
```js
```
The HTML `` tag defines an alternate content to be displayed to users
that have disabled scripts in their browser or have a browser that doesn't
support scripts:
```html
Sorry, your browser does not support JavaScript!
```
## [Head](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_head.asp)
The `` element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed
between the `` tag and the `` tag.
HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.
Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.
It contains the next sections:
* ``: defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and
    it is used to:
    * define the title in the browser toolbar
    * provide a title for the page when it is added to favorites
    * display a title for the page in search engine-results
    ```html
    A Meaningful Page Title
    ```
* ``: define style information for a single HTML page.
    ```html
    ```
* ``: defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource.
    ```html
    ```
* ``: specify the character set, page description, keywords, author of the
    document, and viewport settings. It won't be displayed on the page, but are
    used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), by search engines
    (keywords), and other web services. For example:
    * Define the character set used: ``.
    * Define keywords for search engines: ``.
    * Define a description of your web page: ``.
    * Define the author of a page: ``.
    * Refresh document every 30 seconds: ``.
    * [Setting the viewport](#setting-the-viewport).
* ``: define client-side JavaScripts.
