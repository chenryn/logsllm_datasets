User: How to achieve load balancing and failure recovery in large systems?
Assistant: In large-scale systems, the following strategies are usually used to achieve load balancing and fault recovery: 1. Hardware load balancing: use dedicated devices (such as load balancers) to distribute requests and traffic to avoid resource overload and single point of failure. 2. Load balancing algorithm: Use different algorithms (such as polling, weighted polling, minimum number of connections, etc.) to dynamically distribute requests and traffic to different processors to achieve optimal resource utilization and response time. 3. Data partitioning: partition data into different nodes to balance load and prevent single point of failure. 4. Front-end web servers: Use multiple front-end web servers to handle traffic and requests, and forward requests to application servers in the back-end. 5. Failover and failover: Use backup and redundant systems to ensure high system availability and fast failover, such as using multiple redundant servers, backup databases, and data replication. 6. Automatic expansion and scaling: According to system requirements and load conditions, dynamically increase or decrease the number of processors and servers to ensure efficient and stable system operation. In short, implementing load balancing and fault recovery requires multiple strategies and technologies to ensure high availability, high efficiency, and stability of the system.
