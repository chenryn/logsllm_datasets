I apologize if this issue has already been reported. I am currently using NumPy version 1.6.2.

When attempting to upgrade NumPy, I encountered the following error:

```sh
$ sudo easy_install --upgrade numpy

The package setup script has attempted to modify files on your system that are not within the EasyInstall build area, and has been aborted.
This package cannot be safely installed by EasyInstall, and may not support alternate installation locations even if you run its setup script by hand. Please inform the package's author and the EasyInstall maintainers to find out if a fix or workaround is available.
```

Could you please provide guidance on how to resolve this issue or suggest an alternative method to upgrade NumPy?

Thank you.
