I assume the 1-D hilbert transform function in the signal module was intended
to work like its Matlab equivalent. That is, if I hilbert transform an N-D
array it will only do it along the zeroth dimension.
The hilbert transform was returning zeros for me when I attempted to use it on
two-D arrays. This patch fixes that. The problem was with the arguments passed
to ifft.
