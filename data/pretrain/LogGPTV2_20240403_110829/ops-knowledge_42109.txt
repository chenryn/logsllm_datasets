Assistant: For a group of web applications being deployed, what kind of load balancing strategy and method is ideal depends on the specific scenario and requirements. Generally speaking, the following load balancing strategies and methods are more commonly used and effective: 1. Round robin algorithm: assign load balancing requests to each working server in turn, which is generally applicable to scenarios where each working server has the same processing capacity. 2. Weighting algorithm: The probability of assigning a load balancing request to a working server is proportional to its weight, which is suitable for scenarios where the processing capabilities of each working server are different. 3. Least Connection Algorithm: Assign load balancing requests to the working servers with the least number of connections, which is suitable for scenarios that handle long connections, such as Http requests, WebSockets, etc. 4. IPFoeward algorithm: use the IP address of the client to determine which working server the load balancing request should be assigned to, and is suitable for scenarios where session status needs to be maintained. 5. Combination algorithm: The combination of the above algorithms, in consideration of various factors, selects the most suitable working server for request distribution. It should be noted that load balancing is not static and requires continuous optimization and adjustment to ensure high availability and high performance of web applications.
