### 5.2 Discovery and Management

In this section, we explore how users discover and manage onion sites.

#### 5.2.1 Discovering Onion Links is Not Straightforward

A newly set up onion service is private by default, requiring the operator to disseminate the domain. Established search engines like Google are generally inadequate for finding content on onion services, making their discovery more challenging compared to regular domains. Figure 9 illustrates the results from our survey.

**Social Networking Sites and Search Engines:**
- **Social Networking Sites (48%):** Many participants discovered onion sites through social networking platforms such as Twitter and Reddit.
- **Search Engines (46%):** Specialized search engines like Ahmia were also popular. Ahmia is an onion site search engine that crawls user-submitted onion domains and publishes a list of all indexed services at https://ahmia.fi/onions/.
- **Random Encounters (46%):** Some participants stumbled upon onion links while browsing the web.
- **Other Methods (16%):** A smaller group used independently-maintained onion domain aggregators. The Hidden Wiki, a community-curated and frequently-forked wiki, was a notable example, used by 13 respondents.

**Challenges in Discovery:**
- **Link Rot:** Many respondents (28/517) complained about broken, unusable, or outdated links on aggregators.
- **Lack of Curation:** Aggregators often contain scam and phishing sites, and it is difficult to validate the legitimacy of listed onion links.
- **Content Filtering:** Some respondents (28/517) found it challenging to filter out illegal and pornographic content, especially when descriptions were vague.
- **Need for Better Search Engines:** Many (33/517) expressed dissatisfaction with existing search engines and desired a "Google for onion sites" with opt-in and opt-out options for discovery.

#### 5.2.2 Saving and Tracking Onion Links is Difficult

**Bookmarking Links:**
- **Tor Browser Bookmarks (52%):** Most respondents used Tor Browser's bookmarks to save onion domains.
- **Web-Based Bookmarking Tools (3%):** A few used web-based tools.
- **Local Text Files (37%):** Some saved onion domains in local text files.
- **Trusted Websites (35%):** Others obtained links from trusted sources.
- **Other Techniques (9%):** A minority used various ad-hoc methods, including encrypted storage, auto-complete, personal blogs, and virtual machines.

**Challenges in Saving and Tracking:**
- **Security Concerns:** Bookmarking leaves traces on the computer, violating Tor Browser's "disk avoidance" security requirement.
- **Ad-Hoc Solutions:** Many (26%) lacked a good solution for tracking onion links, highlighting the need for a dedicated Tor Browser extension.

#### 5.2.3 Onion Domains are Hard to Remember

**Memorization Reasons:**
- **Ease of Access (65%):** Respondents memorized onion domains to visit sites quickly and minimize traces of their browsing habits.
- **Automatic Memorization (20%):** Repeated typing helped some remember domains.
- **Verification (15%):** Ensuring they visited the correct site and not a phishing site.
- **Privacy (9%):** Avoiding bookmarking to prevent leaving traces.

**Memorization Challenges:**
- **Random Strings:** Many found it difficult to remember long, random strings of letters and numbers.
- **Vanity Domains:** Easier to remember but perceived as less secure due to potential phishing risks.

#### 5.2.4 Vanity Domains: More Memorable, Less Trusted

**Memorizability:**
- **Ease of Use (64%):** Vanity domains were appreciated for being easy to remember and recognize.
- **Branding (34%):** They provided unique branding and informed visitors about the site's content.

**Phishing and Security:**
- **Phishing Risks:** Some respondents (29/517) felt vanity domains made phishing easier, as attackers could create similar-looking domains.
- **False Security Expectations:** There was concern that short, recognizable prefixes might lead users to verify only the prefix, ignoring the rest of the domain.

In summary, while vanity domains enhance usability, they also introduce security concerns. Users need better tools and practices to manage and verify onion links effectively.
