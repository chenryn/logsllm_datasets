Moreover, one interview participant (P10) claimed that
using onion links may inﬂuence the usability of their “nor-
mal” corresponding websites—the person shared a story
in which they postulated that their Facebook account had
been ﬂagged for suspicious activity and then was deac-
tivated because they had logged in through Tor Browser.
These interview participants did not realize that while the
company indeed knows who is logging in, it does not
know Tor users’ IP address or operating system.
5.2 Discovery and Management
We now explore how users discover and keep track of
onion sites.
5.2.1 Discovering onion links is not straightforward
Recall that a freshly set up onion service is private by
default, leaving it up to its operator to disseminate the
domain. Established search engines such as Google are
therefore generally inadequate to ﬁnd content on onion
services. Therefore discovering onion services is not as
straightforward as with regular domains Figure 9 illus-
trates the results from our survey.
Social networking site and search engines. The three
most popular ways that almost half of our survey partic-
ipants discovered onion sites by were via (i) social net-
working sites such as Twitter and Reddit (48%), (ii) search
engines such as Ahmia,7 (46%) and (iii) randomly en-
countering links when browsing the Web (46%). Sur-
vey respondents who selected “Other” (16%) for how
they discover onion links predominantly brought up
independently-maintained onion domain aggregators. A
noteworthy example is the Hidden Wiki used by 13 sur-
vey respondents, a community-curated and frequently-
forked wiki that contains categorized links to onion ser-
vices. At least 34 survey respondents searched for onion
links on regular browsers and 18 of these respondents
looked speciﬁcally at regular websites to see if they had

ticipants, most of whom (85%) rated themselves as non-
experts (versus 15% self-rated experts) in knowledge
about Internet privacy and security, lacked the ability
to evaluate (or even understand) the Tor network’s design
which is why they deferred to expert opinion, their gut
feeling, or the trust they place in Tor developers to gauge
how much to trust these services. As S450 put it:‘There’s
a safety tradeoff. My connection to onion sites is more
secure from outside eyes, but onion sites are more likely to
be scams.’ With respect to onion services, the majority of
survey respondents expressed that the added security and
anonymity made them feel safe (117/517). Another factor
contributing to the perceived security of onion services is
that advertising companies are nowhere near as present on
onion services as they are on the Web. 80/517 respondents
trusted Tor and themselves to be safe on onion services
while only a minority of interviewees were content and
believed in the future of onion services (4/17) or placed
their trust in them (2/17). Additionally, 30/517 partici-
pants said they would also choose onion services over
regular websites because they trust them.
Reasons for distrust. 90/517 of survey respondents were
skeptical of trusting onion services because of the possi-
bility of phishing, the fact that onion services are hard to
verify as authentic, and a concern that tracking can still
occur even with onion services (59/517). Furthermore, at
least 20/517 respondents said their trust of onion services
would depend on the content of the services themselves.
Some survey respondents did not have a clear understand-
ing of onion services or thought they were the same as
regular websites and reported as much (34/517).
Although our interviewees tended to see onion services
as safer than corresponding websites (eight versus four
participants), six participants felt that users should be
careful when using onion services. Not all participants
trusted onion services (5/17) and one expressed frustra-
tion such as P06:“I’m pretty distrusting with most of the
420    27th USENIX Security Symposium

about link rot on aggregators where onion links were bro-
ken, unusable, or outdated. There is signiﬁcant churn
among onion sites, and our respondents were frustrated
that aggregators are typically not curated and therefore
link to numerous dead domains. The lack of curation
also leads to these aggregators’ containing the occasional
scam and phishing site. The difﬁculty of telling apart two
given onion domain names exacerbates this issue for users.
15/517 did not trust onion link lists because it is hard to
validate if they are legitimate or not. 28/517 complained
about ﬁltering onion sites related to their interests with
several wanting to avoid illegal and pornographic content,
which is often difﬁcult if the description is vague and the
onion domain reveals nothing about its content. For this
reason, 5/517 wished aggregators were more verbose in
their description of onion sites.
Lack of good search engines. Many survey respon-
dents complained about the lack of good search engines
(33/517) and were not aware of search engines such as
Ahmia. Among survey respondents who were aware of
such engines, many were dissatisﬁed with both the search
results and the number of indexed onion sites. Unsurpris-
ingly, a “Google for onion sites” was a frequent wish.
Similarly, one of the biggest issues for our interview par-
ticipants was that onion sites are hard to ﬁnd (5/17), or
as P13 put it: “How do you ﬁnd stuff if you don’t know
what you’re looking for or only have a vague idea?” 10
survey respondents desired a better searching solution for
onion services even with recognizing that this would be
a tradeoff for security so services should have opt-in and
opt-out options for discovery. As summarized by one sur-
vey respondent: “Tor is still like the early 1990s Internet
where websites were spread by word of mouth and by
lists of links. In Tor, people publish lists of onion sites
and I pick the ones I’m interested in. Every Tor search
engine is poor and unreliable. Lists of links like Fresh
Onions, while useful, often get out of date quickly, since
many onion sites are unreliably hosted. Tor desperately
needs a good search engine to ﬁnd onion sites and ide-
ally some way of identifying what those sites are about
before clicking on them, since we lack that info in the
URL.” (S339)
5.2.2 Saving and tracking onion links is difﬁcult
Bookmarking links. Conventional domains are often
easy to remember and recognize; most onion domains
are random strings. We explored how users coped with
this challenge. Most survey respondents (52%) use Tor
Browser’s bookmarks or a web-based bookmarking tool
(3%) to save onion domains as seen in Figure 10. At least
two interview participants reported bookmarking links as
well. While convenient, this method of saving onion links

a corresponding onion link. In our interviews, two par-
ticipants mentioned these techniques too. Between one
to three survey respondents mentioned each of the fol-
lowing: using onion link lists generated by onion spiders,
onion.torproject.org, ddg.onion, Imageboard, Google, and
even Wikipedia.
We observed similar patterns in our interview respon-
dents. Interviewees told us that they ﬁnd onion links by
word of mouth (6/17), using a search engine tool (5/17)
including tools like DuckDuckGo (1/17), The Pirate
Bay (1/17), Reddit (1/17), ahmia.ﬁ (1/17), and the search
widget in the Tor browser (1/17). More of our intervie-
wees discovered onion services passively (6/17) by just
happening to hear about or know about speciﬁc onion
services while ﬁve interviewees told us that they looked
actively for onion links, browsing for the content they
needed.
Random encounters or word of mouth. A signiﬁcantly
less popular discovery mechanism was discovering links
through word of mouth, which has the advantage that
domains come from a trusted source (18% of survey re-
spondents). 19/517 were frustrated that it was difﬁcult to
ﬁnd out if a regular website had an onion service version
even if they visited their website. Only 4% of our sur-
vey respondents—indicated that they were not interested
in learning about new onion services because they only
use their own sites (7/517). Similarly, two interviewees
claimed that they never searched for new onion links.
Link discovery challenges. The majority of our survey
respondents (55%) reported that they were satisﬁed with
how they discover onion services but a signiﬁcant pro-
portion of our participants (38%) were not and 7% did
not respond to this question. Those satisﬁed reported
that they had no interest in learning about new onion ser-
vices, in part because they only use a small set of onion
services. Among the survey respondents who were not
satisﬁed with how they discover onion services (38%),

domains, done by four interviewees, followed by three in-
terviewees who simply click on links they encounter. Two
interviewees would go to onion sites using bookmarks
while another two use Google to get to onion services.
Only one interview participant told us that they typed
the domains from their notes. Given the high number of
(possibly insecure) home-baked solutions, a Tor Browser
extension that solves the problem of saving and tracking
onion links seems warranted.
5.2.3 Onion domains are hard to remember
Memorization reasons. Our participants often memo-
rized onion domains to make it easier to visit onion sites
and to minimize traces of their browsing habits. Of the
survey respondents who memorize onion domains, we
found that most respondents do no memorize any onion
domains (60%) and less than a third (30%) memorize one
to four onion domains. Only 3% can memorize more
than four domains. Survey respondents who memorized
domains (65% of all respondents) did so (i) automatically
because of typing a domain many times (20%) (ii) to al-
low them to open an onion site more quickly (17%), and
(iii) to ensure that they are visiting the correct site and not
a phishing site (15%). Only 9% were privacy conscious
and did so because bookmarking onion domains leaves
a trace. 5% of the respondents gave other reasons for
memorizing onion links. In these open-ended responses,
18 survey participants said that memorizing was simply
easy for them, even unintentional. Among these partici-
pants, there were only 8/517 that speciﬁcally mentioned
the Facebook onion site as very easy to remember. Only
a few survey respondents (3/517) did not memorize onion
sites at all.
Memorization challenges. Our interview participants
generally found onion domains problematic in terms of
having to remember random strings of letters and numbers.
Four interviewees perceived onion domains as too long.
Among these participant was one who further complained
about random characters in onion domains. At least two
interviewees criticized onion links for being hard to re-
member. This viewpoint was echoed in our survey, where
participants rated URLs such as expyuzz4wqqyqhjn.onion
and torproz4wqqyqhjn.onion as harder to remember be-
cause the “numbers make the names harder to remember.”
Other survey respondents stated that vanity domains are
easier to remember when they can be pronounced as de-
scribed in the example quote by survey respondent (S46):
“phonetic pronunciation plays a large part in how I re-
member onions.” Many other survey respondents stated
that onion domains that are supported by a mnemonic are
also easier to remember; we elaborate on this result in
Section 5.2.4.
Figure 10: Strategies to manage onion domains.
leaves a trace of (presumably) visited sites on somebody’s
computer. One of Tor Browser’s security requirements is
“disk avoidance”—the browser must not write anything
to disk that would reveal the user’s browsing history [24,
§ 2.1]. Bookmarking links is a violation of this security
requirement, albeit one that users seem to want.
Ad-hoc tracking methods. Somewhat less popular
amongst our survey participants was saving onion do-
mains in local text ﬁles (37%), getting them from trusted
websites (35%), using search engines (18%), memorizing
domains (17%), using some other techniques (9%), or
employing pen and paper (8%). Of the 9% of our survey
respondents who selected “Other”, 15/517 stated that they
store onion domains in an encrypted manner—either in a
text ﬁle or in their password manager. Other techniques
mentioned by only one or two survey respondents each
included using auto-complete, storing them on a personal
blog or using Twitter to ﬁnd links, emailing the links to
oneself, using redirect rules to automatically go to the
.onion domain, storing the links in a virtual machine, or
using Hidden Wiki. Four of our interviewees reported
that they store onion services in a list and three remember
(some) onion services. Other techniques for saving onion
links mentioned by interviewees mirrored those of the
survey and included using a Twitter feed to track onion
links (1/17) and using TorChat as storage places for onion
links (1/17). Moreover, one interviewee believed that Tor
Browser remembers onion links and another interview
participant (P1) explained: “The onion services we run
professionally we keep track of because we operate the
server, so that’s easy.” Notably, just over one-quarter of
our survey respondents (26%) did not have a good solu-
tion to the problem of tracking onion links and similarly
two interviewees pointed out that they lacked an onion
link management mechanism.
Reaching onion domains quickly. We also asked our in-
terviewees how they typically reach onion services. The

ier recollection if you can chunk words that are associated
with daily life and not just a random. If there’s entropy
in the stream, there’s no way I’m going to remember
more than a few characters” (P18). P10 had a different
perspective that suggested these vanity domains make
onion services more usable: “I think that for people who
don’t spend a lot of time using those types of services, it
deﬁnitely gives you a more familiar framework for think-
ing about where you are on the Internet. If people think
. . . people have a pretty strange geographic metaphors for
navigating the Internet, but I think this idea of where are
you? Well, I’m at this place I can’t even name, I can’t say
it out loud, I think that can be a barrier for people.”
Phishing and security. If users focus on the vanity part
of a domain only, attackers can create an similar domain
that features the original’s preﬁx but differs in subsequent
characters. Nurmi [23] and Monteiro [19] have both
documented such an attack, but its effectiveness is not
known.
Indeed, in several cases, both survey (29/517) and in-
terview participants found that vanity domains were not
practical and seemed to distrust them because they felt
they made phishing easier: “I don’t think it’s useful be-
cause . . . it’s followed by another random word . . . and
phishing can still copy that . . . I don’t think what I can re-
member is safe now.” (P17). Similarly, as S94 explained:
“We also get false expectations of security from such do-
mains. Somebody can generate another onion key with
same facebookcorewwwi address. It’s hard but may be
possible. People who believe in uniqueness of generated
characters, will be caught and impersonated.”. Among
our survey respondents, there was also concern that the
short and recognizable preﬁxes tempt users to verify only
the preﬁx and ignore the non-vanity part of the onion
domain, as epitomized by one survey respondent: “I only
memorize the ﬁrst part of the domain.” (S96) while an-
other wrote: “If there isn’t some cognizable word at the
start, it’ll be more difﬁcult for me to determine if I’m go-
ing to the correct domain or a scam. I may end up going
to less onion sites as a result.” (S355)
This viewpoint was echoed by our interview partici-
pants, who noticed that vanity domains can negatively
affect security. P13 explained: “I think in theory, on the
one [hand], it makes it easier for you to recognize where
you are, it makes it easier for you to perhaps, share the
URL or type it out. On the other hand, I’ve seen con-
cerns that, by having a vanity URL where perhaps people
only look for the Facebook portion and they don’t pay
attention to what comes after it could potentially make it
easier to exploit unsuspecting users. Send them a link that
also says Facebook but the numbers after it are different,
but you just see the Facebook part and go, ‘It’s ﬁne, it’s
Facebook.’ That can be a risk to them.” P5 also shared

5.2.4 Vanity domains: more memorable, less trusted
Memorizability. The majority of our survey respondents
appreciated vanity domains because they were easy to
remember (64%) and easy to recognize (64%), and they
provided a unique “branding” (34%). Some survey re-
spondents indicated that a vanity preﬁx—like a traditional
domain—informs about an onion service’s content, let-
ting visitors know what to expect and thus preventing
unpleasant surprises but at least 3/517 wanted more clues
to let visitors know more about what the domain content
is or for some content to be harder to ﬁnd. As S423 wrote:
