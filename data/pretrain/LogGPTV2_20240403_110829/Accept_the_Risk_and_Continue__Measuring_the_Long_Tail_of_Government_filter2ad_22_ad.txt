7 DISCUSSION
In the remainder of the paper, we discuss the limitations of our
work (section 7.1), our disclosure process, and the effectiveness of
the disclosures (section 7.2). We further present our experiential
perspective on the importance of https for government websites
with examples (section 7.3), and conclude by providing our recom-
mendations to improve https adoption for governments (section 8).
7.1 Study Limitations
7.1.1 Biases. As mentioned in Section 4.1.1, the study conserva-
tively selects only hostnames with a valid government TLD like
.gov, .gouv, .gub, .guv, .gob, .go followed by valid country codes,
excepting the hand-curated list. However, we note that some gov-
ernments do use other TLDs, like .net, .org or .com, for their official
websites. Such websites, even with valid https, would largely be
excluded from this study.
Additionally, the measurement is a single snapshot of the state of
https adoption in governments across the world and not a longitu-
dinal study. Our results do not account for natural churn in website
availability and https support, on which we do not make claims,
though it may be interesting in future work to document “gaps”
in https for important websites. We also acknowledge country-
based biases in our dataset, towards large countries with higher
technology adoption like the USA. While our work aims to combat
these biases by seeking the “long tail” of websites, it fails to avoid
them completely. Such biases are inherent in the Internet itself;
recent estimates by Solarwinds indicate that the United States hosts
approximately 43% of the world’s top million websites followed by
Germany and China respectively [67]. This skew may persist for
government websites; for example, the USA has 6 times as many
reachable government websites as South Korea. Larger or more
populous countries may have more websites split at the regional
and county levels compared to smaller countries.
7.1.2 Location. We perform this snapshot from a single location
instead of using geographically distributed scanners; censorship
by a country’s firewall could affect our snapshot. For example, the
“Great Firewall of China” [1] has been particularly challenging.
We were only able to reach around 50% of Chinese government
hostnames in our crawls, and around 20% of Chinese hostnames
in the top millions seed list. Figure 1 shows a very low rate of
valid https among reachable sites for China. Using a VPN service
(provided through ExpressVPN [28]) to crawl from locations closer
to China, such as Hong Kong, did not yield better results. Lack of
access to most Chinese websites weakens our claims about https
in China, but we believe our estimate is not wildly inaccurate as we
have still scanned 22,487 Chinese sites. (Of these sites, 13,080 use
https while 9,407 use http. Of those using https, only 11% (1,438)
use it correctly, with similar reasons for invalidity as worldwide.
60.1% (7,861) of cases are invalid because of hostname mismatches,
and 16.23% (2,124) are invalid because of the inability to get a local
issuer certificate. 9.68% (1,267) websites use a self-signed certificate,
0.4% use a self-signed certificate in the chain, and 2.56% use an
expired certificate.) Given the difficulty of travel to China in recent
months and administrative barriers to accessing local datacenters
and cloud providers, it seems unlikely in the short term that we
will get better measurements for these sites.
Sampling. Our comparisons of government vs. non govern-
7.1.3
ment websites in section 5.5 used a set of randomly sampled non-
government websites in the top millions with a similar ranking
distribution to the government sites. While we believe our anal-
ysis after sampling is accurate, scanning the whole top million
non-government websites instead of sampling could increase our
result’s precision. The effects of rank presented in Figure 7 also
implicitly assume that the 20,000 sites in each bin are similar; https
adoption for each bin is measured with only a statistically signifi-
cant representative sample.
7.1.4 Alternatives. Finally, other countries such as India, United
Kingdom, and Australia provide authoritative listings of govern-
ment websites and could have been chosen as case studies. We chose
the USA and South Korea for their similarity in Internet adoption
rates and human development index scores across language and cul-
ture differences, but a larger set of cases and a longitudinal analysis
of the government websites would provide more nuanced views.
7.2 Notification & Disclosure
Government domain name registrations are typically handled by
a separate registrar for each government and expected to meet
stringent verification requirements. For example, on March 5, 2020
the US (dotgov) registrar made it mandatory to obtain notarized

signatures on authorization letters when requesting a .gov host-
name [35] due to recent attacks [45] that allowed an impersonator
to register a government hostname.
As a part of our analysis, we generated reports per country of
potentially vulnerable hostnames, including invalid https, failed
upgrades of http to https, and unreachable hostnames which were
still linked from other pages that we discovered during the analysis.
We emailed the respective countries’ government domain regis-
trars (performing whois queries on the country registrars to find
listed technical contacts), included their vulnerable hostnames as a
file attachment and requested contact information for the domain
owners or appropriate forwarding of our reports. We sent emails
to 182 countries, since 9 (Angola, Benin, Democratic Republic of
Congo, Estonia, Guinea, Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, and
Vanatu) countries had https for every detected hostname, and at
the time of disclosure we still had no hostnames for 7 countries
due to our conservative filtering. 175 emails were delivered, and 7
bounced. We retried the 7 countries by emailing the listed adminis-
trative contact, of which 4 emails failed again. 6 registrars sent an
automated message acknowledging the receipt of our email. Some
of the countries with valid https for all hostnames had very few in
total (≈30); an in-depth analysis of these countries may be needed
to clarify the correctness of this result.
Responses were surprisingly positive. 39 domain registrars were
supportive: 3 (Brazil, Lebanon, and Liberia) provided us with the
necessary contact information, 13 of them (Austria, Bosnia & Herze-
govina, Burundi, Cayman Islands, Columbia, Lithuania, Nether-
lands, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Tonga, and Ukraine)
re-directed our emails to the corresponding government author-
ity or a responsible person who was the intended recipient, and
2 (Japan, and Norway) responded mentioning that they could not
provide us with contact information that isn’t publicly available
in the whois and suggested that we query their whois servers for
the information. The registrar of one country responded negatively,
saying “We are not interested”.
Previous work by Stock et al. showed that transmission of vul-
nerability reports to actual domain owners had very limited impact
on successful resolution, and only resulted in a very small (∼5.8%)
number of emails being actually received [75]. In our study, 22%
of the country government domain registrars / CERT authorities
proactively replied to our messages and have begun taking the nec-
essary steps to fix their certificates. We believe that for government
domains, the registrar, who might represent a government body,
may have a higher incentive to respond to such reports than individ-
ual developers and is in a position of power to make a meaningful
change. In section 7.2.2 we discuss a follow-up scan to measure the
effectiveness of our notifications, conducted 2 months after.
Figure 13: Response by Country Population (Rank)
7.2.1 Experiences with Disclosure to Governments. Interestingly,
we found a pattern where domain registrars of countries with the
highest population were least communicative and responsive to our
emails, but saw a much higher response rate from countries with
medium or low populations as shown by the higher density of green
stripes between rank 50-100 and after 200 in the center of Figure 13.
34 countries are territories of other countries (white bands in the
figure), and thus were not included in our study. Despite the lack
of responses from other countries which were successfully notified,
we notice possible silent updates to the websites addressing the
issue as presented in section 7.2.2.
7.2.2 Notification Effectiveness. Two months after notification, we
scanned the 15,179 government websites with previously invalid
https to understand notification effectiveness. 1,572 of these were
unreachable and seem to have been removed, while 1,263 websites
had fixed the certificate invalidity issues. 12,344 sites continue
to serve content with invalid certificates. Assuming that newly
unavailable websites (no longer returning a 200 status) have been
removed on purpose by webmasters and considering this a fix,
we optimistically estimate improvement at 18.7%; otherwise, the
improvement is only 8.3%.
Of the 47,458 sites unreachable in our original scan and thus not
considered in our list of 135,139 sites, we notice that 38,077 continue
to be unreachable, while 2,850 (6%) sites now serve content using
an invalid certificate, and 6,531 (13.76%) sites serve content with
a valid certificate. 950 (1.15%) websites which previously served
http-only traffic now serve valid https traffic, while 1,523 (1.85%)
websites serve content with an invalid certificate, and the remaining
(96.9%) continue to use only http.
Preliminary findings indicate that notifications and disclosure
do have a small positive effect, with 62 countries showing at least a
10% improvement in valid https and 7 countries (Bahrain, Burk-
ina Faso, Cuba, Honduras, Portugal, Libya, and Vietnam) showing
improvement above 40%. Since we do not perform a full re-scan
of all hostnames and only measure changes in sites which were
previously invalid, we cannot measure deterioration of websites.
The United States government issued a statement after our disclo-
sure mandating HSTS preloading for “.gov" websites by September
1, 2020 [21]. However, we cannot definitively attribute positive
changes and the improvements to our disclosures.
7.3 Why Should Governments Care?
We discuss a number of specific threats due to lack of valid https
and risky certificate infrastructure.
7.3.1 Censorship. Without https, other countries’ governments
may censor content for their nation. In 2015, Russia’s efforts to cen-
sor specific content on Wikipedia failed due to its use of https, and
they were left with the choice to either ban the platform completely
or let the content be accessible uncensored [32].
7.3.2 Attacks with Valid Certificates. Prior work has also demon-
strated compelled certificate creation attacks, in which government
agencies can compel a CA to issue false certificates, which can then
be used to intercept secure communication for surveillance pur-
poses [72]. A disproportionate number of CAs are US organizations,

potentially vulnerable to compulsion by the US government. For ex-
ample, the Mozilla NSS trusted CA store indicates 42 CAs registered
in the USA, followed in second place by Bermuda and Spain with 6
CAs each, 4 each in Taiwan, China, India and Belgium. The USA is
home to 7 times more trusted root CAs than the next country in
which CAs are based. Any CAs registered in other countries are
also vulnerable to their respective governments.
Automated certificate issuance has become extremely simple
and almost zero cost to the domain owner due to services like Let’s
Encrypt. Attackers can purchase domain names mimicking gov-
ernment websites (see Section 4.1.1) from private registrars such
as GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc., albeit for a higher price (approx.
150 USD). For example, we found a website registered with the
Sierra Leone country code, etagov.sl, posing as the Sri Lankan
government’s travel authorization portal eta.gov.lk, with a valid
certificate. Uninformed users might mistake the country code .sl
for Sri Lanka, when in fact it is .lk and register for a visa on the
phishing website resulting in identity theft. We have responsibly
disclosed this vulnerability to the LK Domain Registrar, Lanka
Government Information Infrastructure. We also find 85 unique
hostnames which end with “gov.us” of the format abcgov.us, in-
dicating the very real threat of carrying out such spoofing attacks
with perfectly valid certificates obtained from a free CA or CDN.
7.3.3 Cross-Government Links. Finally, in our crawls we noticed a
lot of cross-government links between different countries. Austrian
government sites contain the largest number, linking to 70 other
governments. Such links should be carefully curated, as they could
be used to find and exploit vulnerable government sites. Links not
using https could misdirect users to MITM versions, spreading
misinformation, hate speech, or carrying out phishing attacks on
visitors from specific other countries.
8 RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on our results, we outline possible security threats and rec-
ommend improvements to secure government sites. While these
recommendations may involve challenging infrastructural changes,
we believe they can be tractable with the right industry, govern-
ment, and open-source collaborations, and would strongly improve
the certificate ecosystem and security of government websites.
8.1 For Certificate Authorities
Currently, Let’s Encrypt issues challenges to domain owners to
provision a DNS record or an http resource under a known URI for
the requested domain, thereby binding public keys to the domain.
In response to the problem of public key reuse (Section 5.3.3), we
recommend that CAs perform additional checks to see if the public
key has already been issued a certificate for another hostname and
check if the new hostname is a sub-domain of the previous one.
Coupled with certificate transparency, this could make it easier to
discover hosts using compromised or repeated keys.
CAs like Let’s Encrypt might also be able to selectively issue
EV certificates for government hostnames based on a digital signa-
ture on government domain information from the country CERT
division, or collaborate with different governments’ root CA au-
thorities to provision a certificate with the country CA certificate
as an intermediate in the chain. The inclusion of an intermediate
government CA provides the ability for local governments to vali-
date the signing requests, and coupled with the CAA records, could
prevent distrust with other governments where the CA services
operate from or whose legal regulations they should comply with.
8.2 For Domain Registrars and Owners
Given the possibility of domain-based spoofing or phishing attacks,
domain registrars should pay special attention to domain names in-
cluding key words involving government functions and potentially
establish special checks.
In conducting our study, we found that most countries have a
separate CERT division or cybersecurity response center with a
country-specific root CA, often used for internal purposes such as
citizen identity, digital signatures, etc. We suggest using country
government CAs as intermediate CAs for government websites,
with the root CA as Let’s Encrypt or another CA. As shown, domain
owners and webmasters operating government sites tend to use
Let’s Encrypt due to ease. While this may be better than having no
certificate, other options exist, albeit with increased bureaucratic
barriers, which could be circumvented with collaboration between
CAs and government root CAs. Additionally, we recommend gov-
ernments include DNSSEC signed CAA records for their websites
so that only trusted CAs can issue certificates. We also recommend
that domain owners enlist government websites into the HTTP
Strict Transport Security (HSTS) Preload list directing browsers to
always use TLS to communicate with the website [39].
9 CONCLUSION
Many (≈72%) government sites do not still use https, either due
to lack of TLS infrastructure or a large variety of certificate errors.
Through our study of 135,139 government websites across the In-
ternet from almost every country in the world, we have identified
major categories and frequencies of these errors, with an aim to
privately disclose to the sites’ web administrators and measure the
effects. Common errors include the misconfiguration of hostnames,
expired certificates, reuse of keys and serial numbers between sites
likely to be hosted on different servers or use of default certificates,
using insecure cryptographic algorithms such as MD5, or SHA1,
certificate self-signing, and other issues. In the US, our recommenda-
tions can be used to improve compliance with the DOTGOV Online
Trust in Government Act of 2019 outlining requirements (includ-
ing https) for the .gov domain, facilitating the technical security
practices needed to maintain public trust in the government [66].
