Question: "A security analyst claims that simply increasing the frequency of data backups will suffice to mitigate the threat of data destruction techniques that overwrite files with random data. What counterargument accurately addresses the limitations of this claim?"
 "A": "While frequent data backups can help restore data, they must also be stored off-system and protected against adversary access to ensure recovery."
 "B": "Data backups should be encrypted to prevent adversaries from overwriting files, as encryption is known to deter data destruction."
 "C": "Overwriting files with random data is an irreversible process, and thus increasing the frequency of backups will not mitigate this threat."
 "D": "Frequent data backups are sufficient as long as the storage media is physically secure, even if connected to the network."
Answer: A
