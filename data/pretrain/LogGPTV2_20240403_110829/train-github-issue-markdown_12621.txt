### Summary
Tasks from a role included via `include_role` are duplicated when used inside dependencies.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Define a role named `technical`.
2. Define a role named `base` that includes `technical` using `include_role`.
3. Define a role named `service1` that depends on `base`.
4. Define a role named `service2` that also depends on `base`.
5. Create a playbook that applies roles `service1` and `service2` to a host.

### Expected Results
The tasks should be applied as follows:
- `base` (which includes `technical`)
- `service1`
- `service2`

### Actual Results
The tasks are applied as follows:
- `base` (which includes `technical`)
- `service1`
- `technical` (duplicated)
- `service2`

This duplication of the `technical` role's tasks is unexpected and should be resolved.
