User: How to Check the Network Port Status Through the Unix/Linux System Command Line?
Assistant: You can use the following commands to view the network port status in Unix/Linux systems: 1. netstat command: The netstat command can display various network status information such as network connections, routing tables, and network interfaces. Use the following command to view the network port status of the Unix/Linux system: ``` netstat -an | grep LISTEN ``` This command will display all open network connections, and only display the ports in the listening state. 2. lsof command: The lsof command can list all open files and network connections in the system. Use the following command to view the network port status of the Unix/Linux system: ``` sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN ``` This command will list all open network connections and only display the ports in the listening state. 3. ss command: The ss command is a substitute for the netstat command and is easier to use. Use the following command to view the network port status of the Unix/Linux system: ``` ss -ltn ``` This command will list all TCP connections in the listening state.
