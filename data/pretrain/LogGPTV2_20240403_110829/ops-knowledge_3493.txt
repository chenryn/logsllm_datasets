Question: "An iOS developer is considering whether to implement their own encryption mechanism for a new app to enhance data security. Which of the following are valid reasons for the developer to rely on iOS's built-in encryption and data protection features instead of creating a custom encryption solution?"
 "A": "iOS's built-in encryption is tied to a unique identifier (UID) fused into the Application Processor, making it resistant to tampering."
 "B": "Custom encryption solutions can directly access the AES 256-bit key fused into the device's hardware, offering a higher security level."
 "C": "Data protection classes in iOS allow for granular control over data access based on the user's passcode and device's UID."
 "D": "Implementing a custom encryption solution allows the developer to bypass the iOS sandboxing restrictions for greater flexibility."
