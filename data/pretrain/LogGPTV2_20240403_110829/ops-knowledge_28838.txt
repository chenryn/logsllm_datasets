User: Please describe the differences and pros and cons between containers and virtual machines.
Assistant: Both containers and virtual machines can be used to isolate applications or systems to improve application reliability and security. However, their design concepts and implementation methods are different, and they have the following differences and advantages and disadvantages: 1. The isolation levels of containers and virtual machines are different: containers are user spaces on top of the host operating system, without an independent operating system kernel; The machine is to virtualize a complete operating system environment on the host machine. 2. The resource occupation of containers and virtual machines is different: containers can share the operating system kernel of the host machine, so when running multiple containers, resources such as memory, CPU, and disk are occupied less than virtual machines. 3. The deployment and startup time of containers and virtual machines are different: containers only need to start user space processes at startup, so the startup speed is faster; virtual machines need to start the entire virtual environment, which requires a longer startup time. 4. The life cycle management of containers and virtual machines is different: containers need to run on the host machine, so it is difficult to manage and deploy remotely, and container orchestration tools are needed; virtual machines can be managed on the cloud platform, providing more flexibility and Convenient life cycle management method. Therefore, the choice of containers and virtual machines needs to be considered according to specific scenarios and requirements. For scenarios that require lighter and faster application deployment and management, containers are more suitable; for scenarios that require higher security and isolation, as well as support for multiple different operating systems, virtual machines are more suitable.
