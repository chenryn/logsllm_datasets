Given hybrid automaton A, k distinct locations v1 ∼ vk ∈
V (where V is A’s location set), and k simple hybrid automata
A1 ∼ Ak such that A, A1, . . ., Ak are mutually independent,
then we can carry out “(parallel) elaboration of A at v1, v2,
. . . , vk with A1, A2, . . ., Ak”, denoted as
E(A, (v1, v2, . . . , vk), (A1, A2, . . . , Ak))

Denote A′ = E(A, (v1, v2, . . . , vk), (A1, A2, . . . , Ak)), we
also say “A′ elaborates A at v1, v2, . . ., vk with A1, A2,
. . ., Ak respectively”.
Intuitively, parallel elaboration of A at v1, v2, . . . , vk with
A1, A2, . . ., Ak can be implemented by elaborating A at v1
with A1, v2 with A2, so on and so forth, until vk with Ak.

system H′, has its member hybrid automata respectively elabo-

the form of the following theorem.

“trajectory” of a hybrid system) of H′ that violates PTE safety

automata, φ′(t) corresponds to an execution trace φ(t) of H
(the hybrid system of Asupvsr, Aptcpnt,i (i = 1, 2, . . . , N − 1),
and Ainitzr) that also violates PTE safety rules. This contradicts

supervisor. The supervisor/laser-scalpel can abort/cancel laser
emission at any time (for example, when the supervisor detects
the patient’s blood oxygen level reaches below a threshold, it
can immediately request aborting laser emission and resuming
ventilation), but the PTE safety rules must be maintained.
On the other hand, because the supervisor, laser-scalpel,
and the ventilator are connected through wireless, message
losses are possible. Therefore, we want all entities’ risky
behaviors lease based, so that even with message losses, the
wireless CPS can maintain the PTE safety rules.
In order to satisfy the above requirements, we start our
design using the proposed methodology.
First, we see the laser tracheotomy PTE wireless CPS
consists of three entities (i.e. N = 2): the laser tracheotomy
supervisor (together with the SpO2 sensor wired to it) plays
the role of Supervisor, hence entity ξ0; the (surgeon operated)
laser-scalpel plays the role of Initializer, hence entity ξ2; and
the ventilator plays the role of Participant 1, hence entity ξ1.
To demonstrate the use of our proposed lease design pat-
tern, we carry out a case study on wireless laser tracheotomy
as introduced in earlier sections.
Next, we design the hybrid automata for the laser tra-
cheotomy supervisor, laser-scalpel, and ventilator by respec-
tively elaborating Asupvsr, Ainitzr, and Aptcpnt,1.
Setup and Modeling:
In wireless laser tracheotomy (see Fig. 7 (a) for the
application layout), a patient is under anesthesia, hence must
be connected to a ventilator to breathe oxygen. However, a
surgeon may randomly request a laser-scalpel to emit laser, to
cut the patient’s trachea. Therefore, PTE safety rules apply as
follows. Before the emission of laser, the ventilator must have
paused for at least T min
risky:1→2 (we regard ventilator as entity ξ1
and the laser-scalpel as entity ξ2); after the emission of laser,
the ventilator must wait for at least T min
safe:2→1 before resuming.
Otherwise, if high concentration of oxygen in the patient’s
trachea (due to ventilation) is present when laser emits, the
patient’s trachea can catch ﬁre. In addition, the durations that
the laser-scalpel can continuously emit and that the ventilator
can continuously pause shall respectively be upper-bounded by
a constant.
The ventilator and the laser-scalpel are wirelessly con-
nected via a central base station, which also plays the role of
Take the ventilator detailed design for example. The de-
tailed design of a stand-alone ventilator has already been
described by the simple hybrid automaton A′
vent of Fig. 2.
The stand-alone design of A′
vent, however, is not aware of
the communications/collaborations with supervisor and laser-
scalpel; hence cannot guarantee PTE safety rules. In order to
guarantee PTE safety rules, we revise the ventilator design by
elaborating the Participant Design Pattern hybrid automaton
Aptcpnt,i (see Section IV-A-Participant; also see Fig. 5 (b)
for the sketch of the hybrid automaton) at location “Fall-
Back” with A′
vent, using the elaboration method described in
Section IV-C.
The Initializer hybrid automaton Ainitzr and Supervisor
hybrid automaton Asupvsr do not need to be further elaborated.
They can be directly used to describe the behavior of laser-
scalpel and laser tracheotomy supervisor respectively.
Interested readers shall refer to [19] for the diagrams of
these detailed designs.

We conﬁgure the time parameters of the above detailed
design hybrid automata according to common-sense laser tra-
cheotomy requirements [21] as follows. For the Supervisor (i.e.
the laser tracheotomy supervisor), T min
wait = 3s. For
the Initializer (i.e. the laser-scalpel), T max
enter,2 =
10s, T max
run,2 = 20s, Texit,2 = 1.5s. For the Participant 1 (i.e. the
ventilator), T max
run,1 = 35s, Texit,1 = 6s. The PTE
enter-risky/exit-risky safeguard intervals are T min
risky:1→2 = 3s
and T min
enter,1 = 3s, T max
safe:2→1 = 1.5s.
fb,0 = 13s, T max
req,2 = 5s, T max
Per Theorem 2, the above conﬁgurations guarantee PTE
safety rules. To further validate this, we implemented and
carried out emulations of the above design.
Emulation Setup:
Fig. 7 (b) illustrates the layout of our emulation. The laser
tracheotomy ventilator, supervisor, and (surgeon operated)
laser-scalpel are respectively emulated by three computers. The
patient is emulated by a real human subject (HS).
Instead of actually ventilating the human subject HS,
the ventilator emulator displays its current hybrid automata
location (“PumpOut”, “PumpIn”, etc.). Human subject HS
watches the display and breathe accordingly.
Another complex part of the experiments is the emulation
of externally triggered events. We emulate three kinds of such
events in the laser tracheotomy hybrid system (all other events
are consequences of this set).
The ﬁrst is the Initializer event evtξ2T oξ0Req, triggered
when the laser-scalpel
is in “Fall-Back” and the surgeon
requests to supervisor to emit laser. In the real system, this
is triggered by the surgeon’s human will. In our emulation,
however, this is emulated by setting up a random timer Ton
(following exponential distribution) whenever the laser-scalpel
enters “Fall-Back”. When in “Fall-Back” and Ton sets off,
laser. Timer Ton
the (emulated) surgeon requests to emit
is destroyed whenever the laser-scalpel
leaves “Fall-Back”
location.
The second kind is the Initializer event evtξ2T oξ0Cancel,
triggered when the laser-scalpel is emitting and the surgeon
cancels the request to emit laser. Again in a real system, this
is triggered by the surgeon’s human will. In our emulation,
this is emulated by setting up a random timer Toﬀ (following
exponential distribution) whenever the laser-scalpel is emitting
laser. When emitting laser and Toﬀ sets off, the (emulated) sur-
geon requests to cancel laser emission. Timer Toﬀ is destroyed
whenever the laser-scalpel returns to “Fall-Back” location.
The third kind is the Supervisor event evtξ0T oξiAbort
(i = 1 ∼ N ), triggered when the supervisor is in “Lease
ξi” location and ApprovalCondition becomes false. In our
emulation, the human subject HS wears an oximeter (Nonin
9843 [22]), which measures HS’s blood oxygen level
in
real-time t (SpO2(t)). The oximeter is wired to the laser
tracheotomy supervisor emulator. The ApprovalCondition is
that the oximeter reading SpO2(t) > ΘSpO2 , where ΘSpO2 is
set to 92%.
The supervisor, ventilator, and laser-scalpel emulators com-
municate with each other via wireless, with supervisor as
base station, and the other two as clients. Their wireless
