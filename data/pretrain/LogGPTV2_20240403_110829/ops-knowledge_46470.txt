User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Cannot SysPrep Windows 10 Enterprise (spring creators update): "A fatal error occurred..." I have been creating our Windows 10 "golden image" from a VM, but since I installed the "Spring Creators update" I now cannot SysPrep it. Typically, this is the process I would follow, using PowerShell to find and remove all APPX packages:  

#Audit APPX packages
Import-Module Appx
Import-Module Dism
Get-AppxPackage -AllUser | Format-List -Property PackageFullName | Out-File C:\Temp\AppxJunkToRemove.txt


I then edit the "AppxJunkToRemove.txt" file to create my "RemoveAppXPackages.PS1" script:  

Remove-AppxPackage -Package &lt;packagefullname1&gt;
Remove-AppxPackage -Package &lt;packagefullname2&gt;


Lastly, I would do two other things:  


Disable the NIC in the VM  
Disable the "Tile Data Model" service - tiledatamodelsvc (which is now gone in the SC update, apparently)  


SysPrep is Windows 10 is painful, but following these steps worked 100% of the time for me before the Spring Creators Update. However, now the error I get is:  


  "System Preparation Tool 3.14
  A fatal error occured while tyring to sysprep the machine."


This happens during the "Sysprep is working... processing generalize phase Sysprep plugins..." step. Then this error immediately follows:



I have verified that C:\Windows\System32\SysPrep\Panther folder does not exist before I try the SysPrep. Setuperr.log shows:
Error 0x0f00a8 SYSPRP WinMain:Hit Failure while processing sysprep generalize internal providers  

What I am missing here?

Assistant: There is a great blog post on TechNet about Cleaning up apps to keep Windows 10 sysprep happy. The key takeaways from this are: 


"...sysprep will fail when creating a custom Windows 10 image if there are any apps installed during the image creation process that aren’t also provisioned in the OS."
"Don’t build your images on a VM that has internet access, since there’s no way the Microsoft Store can download any apps when there is no internet connectivity." (Direct Quotes)
