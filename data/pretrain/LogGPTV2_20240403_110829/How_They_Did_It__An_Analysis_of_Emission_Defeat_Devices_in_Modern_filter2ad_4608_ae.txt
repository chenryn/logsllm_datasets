Fig. 3: Selection of curve checks testing against various emissions test cycles in the ﬁrmware for a VW Passat, released 12/2014 (EDC17C54, software part
number 03L906012, revision 7444). The area in which the software reports the driving proﬁle to match is colored white. As evident from the graphs, this
area tends to follow a test cycle closely. The legend lists the known matching test cycles. ⊗ indicates an additional steering wheel check. Figure 14 in the
Appendix depicts the remaining curves.
Steering wheel checks. Starting 2009, the EDC ﬁrmware used
in Volkswagen automobiles increased the number of proﬁles
check from 7 to 10. As noted, the proﬁles shown in Figure 3
were extracted from an EDC17C54 ﬁrmware image, VW part
number 03L906012, that has 10 proﬁles, four of which are
shown in the ﬁgure. (The acoustic condition illustrated in
Figure 2, from an older EDC17C54 function sheet, shows only
7 proﬁles.)
Note that proﬁles 8 and 9 are considerably less precise than
proﬁles 1 and 7. In fact, proﬁle 9 matches a total of 10 known
emissions test cycles. In addition to checking the time-distance
relation shown in Figure 3, proﬁles 8, 9, and 10 also included
a steering wheel angle check: in addition to deviating from
a prescribed time-distance proﬁle, the ﬂip-ﬂop corresponding
to proﬁles 8, 9, and 10 would be reset if the steering wheel
angle deviated by more than 20° from the neutral position.
Unfortunately, we could not obtain a function sheet containing
this improved acoustic condition. The following code is our
reconstruction of the logic used to determine if a steering
wheel angle deviation should cancel the acoustic condition.
if (-20 /* deg */ < steeringWheelAngle &&
steeringWheelAngle < 20 /* deg */) {
lastCheckTime = 0;
cancelCondition = false;
} else {
} else
}
if (lastCheckTime < 1000000 /* microsec */) {
lastCheckTime = lastCheckTime + dT;
cancelCondition = false;
cancelCondition = true;
In the updated ﬁrmware,
