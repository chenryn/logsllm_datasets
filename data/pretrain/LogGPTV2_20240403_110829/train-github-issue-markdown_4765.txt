### Problem
The usage of
    Notes
    ------
vs
    Note: 
vs
    .. note::
is a bit inconsistent. As an example, the linked page use all three versions.
Stats in current main (lib directory, not doc):
  * `Note: `: 19
  * `Notes`: 153
  * `.. note::`: 59
There may for sure be a reason to use a particular approach in a gives
instance, but it also may be a reason to try to make things more consistent.
### Suggested improvement
At least replace the Note: to one of the other.
Replace `Notes` with `.. note::`?
