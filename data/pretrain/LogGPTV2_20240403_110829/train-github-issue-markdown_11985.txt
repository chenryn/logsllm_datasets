Hello,
Atom is great. I am working with a cloud server and don't have the fastest
internet connection. I have the server mounted via win-sshfs. When I save, it
sometimes takes 5-10 seconds for the file to get transferred and saved, and
Atom is completely frozen during that time. It would be great if Atom had the
option to do asynchronous saves so that I could keep editing while the file is
being uploaded to the server.
