Subject: Feature Request: Asynchronous Saves in Atom for Improved Workflow

Hello,

I am a frequent user of Atom and find it to be an excellent code editor. Currently, I am working with a cloud server that is mounted via Win-SSHFS. Given my internet connection speed, saving files sometimes takes 5-10 seconds, during which time Atom becomes unresponsive.

To enhance productivity, it would be highly beneficial if Atom could support asynchronous saves. This feature would allow me to continue editing while the file is being uploaded to the server, significantly improving my workflow.

Thank you for considering this request.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
