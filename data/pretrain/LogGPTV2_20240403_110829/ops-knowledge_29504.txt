User: In a cluster, how to manage resource limits and scheduling policies for containers?
Assistant: In a cluster, Kubernetes can be used to manage resource limits and scheduling policies for containers. Kubernetes provides a range of configuration options for resource limits and scheduling policies to manage containers as they run. The following are some common resource limit and scheduling policy configuration options: Resource limit: 1. CPU limit: Set the maximum amount of CPU time that the container can use to prevent competition and starvation. 2. Memory limit: Set the amount of CPU time that the container can use The maximum amount of memory. 3. Storage limit: Set the maximum amount of storage space that the container can use. Scheduling strategy: 1. Node Selector: Select the corresponding node to run the container through the label. Use this option to enable affinity scheduling to schedule containers to run on specific nodes. 2. Taints, Tolerations: Through the taint of the host and the tolerance of the container, the interaction between the node and the container is realized to ensure that the container always runs on a healthy node. 3. Resource Quota: Set resource limits for a namespace to ensure that all containers in the namespace share cluster resources. 4. Automatic Resource Reservation and Scheduling (ARRS): Kubernetes automatically calculates the resource requirements of containers and schedules them to appropriate nodes. Through these resource restrictions and scheduling policy configuration options, you can more flexibly manage the running of containers in the cluster, optimize resource utilization, and improve the operating efficiency and performance of containers.
