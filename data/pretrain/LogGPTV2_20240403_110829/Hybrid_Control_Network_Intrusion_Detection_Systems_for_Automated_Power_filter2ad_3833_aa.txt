Abstract—In this paper, we describe our novel use of network
intrusion detection systems (NIDS) for protecting automated
distribution systems (ADS) against certain types of cyber attacks
in a new way. The novelty consists of using the hybrid control
environment rules and model as the baseline for what is normal
and what is an anomaly, tailoring the security policies to the
physical operation of the system. NIDS sensors in our architecture
continuously analyze trafﬁc in the communication medium that
comes from embedded controllers, checking if the data and
commands exchanged conform to the expected structure of the
controllers interactions, and evolution of the system’s physical
state. Considering its importance in future ADSs, we chose the
fault location, isolation and service restoration (FLISR) process as
our distribution automation case study for the NIDS deployment.
To test our scheme, we emulated the FLISR process using
real programmable logic controllers (PLCs) that interact with
a simulated physical
infrastructure. We used this testbed to
examine the capability of our NIDS approach in several attack
scenarios. The experimental analysis reveals that our approach
is capable of detecting various attacks scenarios including the
attacks initiated within the trusted perimeter of the automation
network by attackers that have complete knowledge about the
communication information exchanged.

I. INTRODUCTION
A. Scope and Goals
Distribution automation refers to a blend of emerging tech-
nologies, such as switching technologies, sensor detectors,
and communication protocols, that are utilized to control and
monitor the operation of a power distribution system in an
automated fashion [1]. The vision for automated distribution
systems (ADS) is to facilitate the exchange of both electrical
energy and information between system operators, customers,
and other parties and equipment [2]. One of the promises of
ADS, is to allow the remote control and switching of the power
distribution topology for protection and to improve reliability.
In such an application, the system operator would be able
to automatically locate and isolate the faulted distribution
component and restore the electrical service to the healthy
parts of the distribution system. The process, called fault lo-
cation, isolation, and service restoration (FLISR), is expected
to considerably reduce the outage duration for customers [3].
Since ADS applications provide remote access to the crit-
ical distribution system components through communication
networks, it is of paramount importance to coordinate their
development with that of an appropriate cyber security frame-
work that would prevent attackers from gaining control of
circuit breakers and switches. Unfortunately, despite height-
ened attention to cyber security issues [4]–[6], existing ADS
structures were not designed with cyber security in mind.
ADSs are a type of cyber-physical systems in which various
intelligent physical components communicate to each other
through specialized industrial control protocols, e.g., Modbus
TCP, DNP3, and IEC 61850. Several information technology-
based security standards and systems,
including ﬁrewalls,
encryption schemes, authentication mechanisms, and network
intrusion detection systems (NIDS), have been advocated and
adopted in order to isolate control networks perimeters from
external sources [7]–[9]. Firewalls and NIDS are security
mechanisms used to continuously monitor network trafﬁc to
determine whether a packet should be accepted based on
speciﬁc rules and sources allowed inside a network perimeter.
Encryption is also a basic computer security tool used to
maintain conﬁdentiality of communications. Authentication
can be also used to ensure that the sources of commands are
legitimate. However, while ﬁrewalls and IDSs may protect
an ADS against “external” network attacks, based on the
way, they are used, they would typically fail when an attack
is initiated within the protected system perimeter. Moreover,
within a network perimeter, even encryption and authentication
fail when an attack or simply an erroneous but damaging
command is mistakenly issued by an authorized user [10].
The goal of our work is to augment—but not replace—
existing solutions with a novel use of a NIDS. While other
NIDS-based solutions exist that can look purely for cyber
attacks, our solution also considers physical operation within
the perimeter of plant for potentially damaging commands.
This allows our solution to provide utility even in the face
of certain “insider” threats and erroneous but damaging com-
mands issued by authorized users of the system and network.

network trafﬁc. They are intended to attempt to identify the
presence of events that do not comply with security policies.
Security policies are typically based on acceptable information
exchange protocols and known network participants, but are
often agnostic of the application layer.
We call our use of a NIDS for ADSs a hybrid control
NIDS (HC-NIDS) as it incorporates the security policy, control
environment and physical operation rules that come from
the underlying hybrid control system, to set a baseline and
discriminate what is normal from what are instead network
anomalies that may reﬂect an attack.
The idea of using the power system physics, e.g., Ohm’s and
Kirchhoff’s Laws, to operate, monitor and protect the grid, is
at the heart of power system operation and reliability theories.
System physics have previously been used for adequacy and
security analysis [11], to ﬁlter bad measurement values and
to reveal the state of the power grid, as exempliﬁed by State
Estimation (SE) and Energy Management Systems (EMS) for
the bulk power system [12]. A recent proliﬁc line of work
on cyber-physical security has also focused on Byzantine
attacks in the SE functionality [13]. This work highlighted
vulnerabilities of the bad-data detection step of SE in detecting
well-constructed data injection attacks that provide physically
valid measurements.
Our work is closer to an approach focusing on detecting
possible attacks to hybrid systems used for protection and
monitoring on the smart grid. C´ardenas, et al. [14], studied
vulnerabilities in hybrid controllers in SCADA systems to
network attacks. Their control theoretic approach was related
to ours but was more generally focused on process control
systems rather than focusing more speciﬁcally on power
distribution. Lin, et al., [15] proposed to run contingency
analyses to predict future consequences of control commands
on a critical power asset in the context of transmission network
applications. While effective, given the nature of transmission
networks, it assumes information about other parts of the
system are readily available, as they typically are in the
transmission network, but not necessarily in ADSs.
Application of intrusion detection in ADSs has been primar-
ily focused on detection of attacks on the Advanced Metering
Infrastructure (AMI) for monitoring purposes [16]. This work
is conceptually the closest to what we propose, since it uses
known rules about the actual AMI process to identify attacks.
However, although the solution described does focus on the
process, the process focused on is on the cyber level. We be-
lieve that an additional layer of insight and protection in ADSs
can be provided by monitoring speciﬁc physical operation
and also by leveraging sequential pattern information about
legitimate, operational hybrid automata information exchange.
ADSs naturally rely on local sensor measurements, and
therefore are intrinsically vulnerable to data injection attacks.
However, several parameters that specify normal operation
of system can be used to validate changes in data values.
Furthermore, most message patterns in these control networks
are repetitive, since the processes are automated. Careful
accounting for the “cyber” and “physical” context of the
information exchanged within the automation network can en-
hance ability of NIDS to detect attacks, since control message
exchanges need not only to be consistent with the control
protocol, but also with the speciﬁc rules and physical operation
procedures known based on the abstract hybrid networked
automaton model for the ADS environment. The idea can be
viewed as an extension of the concept of formal veriﬁcation
to hybrid cyber-physical systems, which includes the explicit
veriﬁcation of rules used in the hybrid control environment as
well as the physics of the system as the basis for NIDS rules.
We demonstrate the utility of our approach through a set of
threat scenarios against a FLISR system. In particular, we em-
ulate the operation of the FLISR system for a test distribution
feeder using real programmable logic controllers (PLCs) that
use the Modbus TCP protocol for communication. We develop
intrusion detection rules based on the standard network trafﬁc
and operation procedures of the FLISR. We then implement
the rules as signatures in the language of a popular, robust, and
open-source network monitoring framework called Bro [17].
Those signatures explicitly deﬁne acceptable actions, events,
and information patterns in the context of the ADS system’s
physical model. We demonstrate the features and capabilities
of our HC-NIDS by implementing several attack scenarios that
either aim to harm the system on a different way, or retrieve
information about the status of the physical devices.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II
introduces the various components and discusses the “cyber”
vulnerabilities of ADSs. The HC-NIDS for ADS applications
is presented in Section III. The implementation of the IDS
signatures for the FLISR system is presented in Section IV,
where we examine the capability of our approach to detect
various attack scenarios. Finally, concluding remarks and
future work are given in Section V.
II. AUTOMATED DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS: STRUCTURE
AND CYBER VULNERABILITIES
In the following, we brieﬂy introduce the major components
and applications of future ADS, and discuss about the cyber
vulnerabilities of these systems.
A. Structure of Automated Distribution Systems
1) Physical Components: The notion of power delivery in
distribution systems is evolving to cope with the bi-directional
ﬂow of power due to a growing amount of distributed energy
resources (DERs) installed in distribution systems. DERs refer
to distributed generating units (solar, wind, hydro, or biomass
power) and energy storage devices (electric vehicles) that are
connected to the medium or low voltage distribution feeders.
Power grid customers are also becoming ﬂexible energy con-
sumers by responding to time-varying electricity prices. All
these changes in energy production and consumption patterns
in distribution systems are driving advances with ADSs [18].
Technical and operational challenges that arise for distribu-
tion systems include changes in radial feeder power ﬂow, re-
verse power ﬂow in distribution lines, loss of effective voltage
regulation, and over-current protection scheme coordination.

An effective mean for addressing these challenges is the use
of bi-directional reclosers, smart sectionalizers, and advanced
protection relaying schemes. The bi-directional switching,
through vacuum switch technology, can also support distribu-
tion circuit reconﬁguration much more quickly than existing
switching technologies. Moreover, power electronics-based
controllers are key technologies for transforming distribution
systems from passive loads to active systems that can inject
power into the grid [1].
2) Communication, Control, and Monitoring Components:
Communication in ADS include point-to-point and multicast
sessions, over wide-area network (WAN) topologies that con-
nect protective relays, sensors, switches, and control centers
for monitoring, control and protection purposes. The commu-
nication media include power line carrier-based communica-
tion, ﬁber optic, radio systems, and wireless communication,
the selection of which depends to the application [19].
The communication infrastructures enable advanced ADS
monitoring functions, and include fault detection and location,
equipment’s health status identiﬁcation, performance monitor-
ing of protection systems, etc. Advanced smart sensors are
the core components of monitoring systems. They collect data
that include basic electrical quantities, i.e., voltage and current,
and other quantities that monitor the equipment’s status, fault
location, user behavior, environmental parameters and the
health of the various elements on the distribution system. ADS
sensors have embedded intelligence for local data analysis and
communication capabilities to provide smart switching [18].
The network protocols used in ADS includes various industrial
control protocols, e.g. Modbus, DNP3, and IEC 61850.
B. Cyber Vulnerabilities of Automated Distribution Systems
Some concerns were expressed over cyber security weak-
ness and system fragility of power distribution systems [5],
[6]. One of the reasons that exposes ADS to cyber attacks
is the fact that development of automated functions has been
divorced from a systematic cyber-security considerations. In
addition, the unconstrained integration of large numbers of
