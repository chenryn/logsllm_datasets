dnscmd /recordadd test.contoso.com test MX 10 mailserver.test.contoso.com
dnscmd /recorddelete command
Deletes a resource record to a specified zone.
Syntax
dnscmd [] /recorddelete     [/f]
Parameters
Parameters
Description
Specifies the DNS server to manage, represented by IP address, FQDN, or host name. If this parameter is omitted, the local server is used.
Specifies the zone in which the resource record resides.
Specifies a name of the host.
Specifies the type of resource record to be deleted.
Specifies the type of data that is expected.
/f
Executes the command without asking for confirmation. Because nodes can have more than one resource record, this command requires you to be very specific about the type of resource record that you want to delete. If you specify a data type and you do not specify a type of resource record data, all records with that specific data type for the specified node are deleted.
Examples
dnscmd /recorddelete test.contoso.com test MX 10 mailserver.test.contoso.com
dnscmd /resetforwarders command
Selects or resets the IP addresses to which the DNS server forwards DNS queries when it cannot resolve them locally.
Syntax
dnscmd [] /resetforwarders  [,]...][/timeout ] [/slave | /noslave]
Parameters
Parameters
Description
Specifies the DNS server to manage, represented by IP address, FQDN, or host name. If this parameter is omitted, the local server is used.
Lists the IP addresses to which the DNS server forwards unresolved queries.
/timeout 
Sets the number of seconds that the DNS server waits for a response from the forwarder. By default, this value is five seconds.
/slave
Prevents the DNS server from performing its own iterative queries if the forwarder fails to resolve a query.
/noslave
Allows the DNS server to perform its own iterative queries if the forwarder fails to resolve a query. This is the default setting.
/f
Executes the command without asking for confirmation. Because nodes can have more than one resource record, this command requires you to be very specific about the type of resource record that you want to delete. If you specify a data type and you do not specify a type of resource record data, all records with that specific data type for the specified node are deleted.
Remarks
By default, a DNS server performs iterative queries when it cannot resolve a query.
Setting IP addresses by using the resetforwarders command causes the DNS server to perform recursive queries to the DNS servers at the specified IP addresses. If the forwarders don't resolve the query, the DNS server can then perform its own iterative queries.
If the /slave parameter is used, the DNS server does not perform its own iterative queries. This means that the DNS server forwards unresolved queries only to the DNS servers in the list, and it does not attempt iterative queries if the forwarders do not resolve them. It is more efficient to set one IP address as a forwarder for a DNS server. You can use the resetforwarders command for internal servers in a network to forward their unresolved queries to one DNS server that has an external connection.
Listing a forwarder's IP address twice causes the DNS server to attempt to forward to that server twice.
Examples
dnscmd dnssvr1.contoso.com /resetforwarders 10.0.0.1 /timeout 7 /slave
dnscmd dnssvr1.contoso.com /resetforwarders /noslave
dnscmd /resetlistenaddresses command
Specifies the IP addresses on a server that listens for DNS client requests. By default, all IP addresses on a DNS server listen for client DNS requests.
Syntax
dnscmd [] /resetlistenaddresses 
Parameters
Parameters
Description
Specifies the DNS server to manage, represented by IP address, FQDN, or host name. If this parameter is omitted, the local server is used.
Specifies an IP address on the DNS server that listens for DNS client requests. If no listen address is specified, all IP addresses on the server listen for client requests.
Examples
dnscmd dnssvr1.contoso.com /resetlistenaddresses 10.0.0.1
dnscmd /startscavenging command
Tells a DNS server to attempt an immediate search for stale resource records in a specified DNS server.
Syntax
dnscmd [] /startscavenging
Parameters
Parameters
Description
Specifies the DNS server to manage, represented by IP address, FQDN, or host name. If this parameter is omitted, the local server is used.
Remarks
Successful completion of this command starts a scavenge immediately. If the scavenge fails, no warning message appears.
Although the command to start the scavenge appears to complete successfully, the scavenge does not start unless the following preconditions are met:
Scavenging is enabled for both the server and the zone.
The zone is started.
The resource records have a time stamp.
For information about how to enable scavenging for the server, see the scavenginginterval parameter under Server-level syntax in the /config section.
For information about how to enable scavenging for the zone, see the aging parameter under Zone-level syntax in the /config section.
For information about how to restart a paused zone, see the zoneresume parameter in this article.
For information about how to check resource records for a time stamp, see the ageallrecords parameter in this article.
Examples
dnscmd dnssvr1.contoso.com /startscavenging
dnscmd /statistics command
Displays or clears data for a specified DNS server.
Syntax
dnscmd [] /statistics [] [/clear]
Parameters
Parameters
Description
Specifies the DNS server to manage, represented by IP address, FQDN, or host name. If this parameter is omitted, the local server is used.
Specifies which statistic or combination of statistics to display. The statistics command displays counters that begin on the DNS server when it is started or resumed. An identification number is used to identify a statistic. If no statistic ID number is specified, all statistics display. The numbers that can be specified, along with the corresponding statistic that displays, can include:00000001 - Time00000002 - Query00000004 - Query200000008 - Recurse00000010 - Master00000020 - Secondary00000040 - WINS00000100 - Update00000200 - SkwanSec00000400 - Ds00010000 - Memory00100000 - PacketMem00040000 - Dbase00080000 - Records00200000 - NbstatMem/clear - Resets the specified statistics counter to zero.

dnscmd /unenlistdirectorypartition command
Removes the DNS server from the specified directory partition's replica set.
Syntax
dnscmd [] /unenlistdirectorypartition 
Parameters
Parameters
Description
Specifies the DNS server to manage, represented by IP address, FQDN, or host name. If this parameter is omitted, the local server is used.
The FQDN of the DNS application directory partition that will be removed.
dnscmd /writebackfiles command
Checks the DNS server memory for changes, and writes them to persistent storage. The writebackfiles command updates all dirty zones or a specified zone. A zone is dirty when there are changes in memory that haven't yet been written to persistent storage. This is a server-level operation that checks all zones. You can specify one zone in this operation or you can use the zonewriteback operation.
Syntax
dnscmd [] /writebackfiles

dnscmd /zoneadd command
Adds a zone to the DNS server.
Syntax
dnscmd [] /zoneadd   [/dp  | {/domain | enterprise | legacy}]
