I am currently attempting to use Google App Engine with Python and, given my familiarity with Eclipse, I have chosen to work with PyDev. After some initial difficulties, I have managed to get a "Hello World" program almost fully operational. However, I am encountering an issue where the `webapp2` import is unresolved. I have followed all the available instructions and believe that I have correctly linked the Google App Engine libraries. Despite this, I cannot locate `webapp2` as an importable module in any of the library files. 

As a beginner in both Python and Google App Engine, I suspect that this may be a simple problem that is being complicated by my lack of experience. I am using OS X and running Eclipse Indigo Service Release 1, along with the latest version of PyDev as of Tuesday evening.

The current SDK does not support the Python 2.7 runtime on the development server, so it does not include new libraries such as `webapp2`. If you only need the libraries, you can download them and include them in your application manually. However, if you require additional runtime features like multithreading or the Python Imaging Library (PIL), you will need to develop and test your application in the production environment for now.
