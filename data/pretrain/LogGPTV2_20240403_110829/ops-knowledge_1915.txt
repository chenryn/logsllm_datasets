User: I am attempting to try out Google App Engine with python.  Being familiar with Eclipse, I decided to use PyDev.  After some trouble, I have a hello world program working... almost.  It cannot find the webapp2 import, telling me it is unresolved.  I have followed all of the instructions I can find, and have the google app engine libraries linked up - I think.  I have searched for webapp2 as a potential import, and cannot find this anywhere in any of the library files.  I am really new to python in general, and even newer to the Google App Engine, so I am certain that this is a simple problem that is exacerbated by my newness.
I am running on OS-X, running Eclipse Indigo Service Release 1.  I have the latest version of PyDev available for download as of Tuesday evening.
Assistant: The current SDK does not support the Python 2.7 runtime on the dev_appserver, so it doesn't bundle new libraries like webapp2. If all you need is the libraries, you can download them and include them in your app yourself, but if you need extra runtime features like multithreading and PIL, you will need to do your development in the production environment for now.
