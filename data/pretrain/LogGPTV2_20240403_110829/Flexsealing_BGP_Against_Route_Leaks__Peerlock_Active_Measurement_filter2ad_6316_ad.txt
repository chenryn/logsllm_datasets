prevents all distribution of studied leaks over the peering
clique, but leak updates still spread to the majority of the
topology for most experiments. Adding large ISP Peerlock
protection has a relatively signiﬁcant impact on both propaga-
tion and installation.
Peerlock-lite deployment by these ASes (red lines) beneﬁts
from more ﬁlterers with wider protection per ﬁlterer. Naturally,
these scenarios are much more effective at preventing prop-
11
agation. For most leak cases, less than 10% of the topology
receives leak updates. This highlights the leverage large ISPs
have within the topology; ﬁltering at these ASes (<1% of all
networks) generates an extensive shielding effect. The distinct
"shoulder" on the Peerlock-lite curves in Fig. 11b suggests
the impact on ASes using the leak is even more pronounced.
There is virtually no impact on target link usage for 75% of
simulated leaks when Peerlock-lite is deployed by all large
ISPs. Interestingly, the combination of Peerlock and Peerlock-
lite ﬁltering by large ISPs (green line) adds little value over
Peerlock-lite alone.
C. Discussion
Path Encoding: To analyze how each of these scenarios
shapes leak propagation (and route selection/export), we col-
lect the AS PATH of all leaks exported during the above
experiments. We use a novel path encoding whereby each
AS on leak AS PATHs is converted to a 2-tuple with the
form (relationship to next AS, UCLA class [33]). Only the AS
PATH segment from the ﬁrst customer to provider link to the
leaker ASN - the leak segment - is encoded. This trimming
discards the "down" segment prepended as leaks propagate
within customer cones, as well as the the segment connecting
leaker and destination that is invariant across leaks. We include
AS relationship in the encoding because of its importance in
path export behavior as described in Section II-A; UCLA class
informs us regarding where leaks travel through the routing
hierarchy. Taken together, these factors help us understand
broadly the topological dynamics at play in leak propagation,
and to capture the dominant leak propagation vectors under
each protection scenario.
Relationship is encoded as "C" (customer), "R" (peer), or
"P" (provider). UCLA classes are indicated by "T" (Tier 1),
"L" (large ISP), "S" (small ISP), and "U" (stub). Example:
[LR, TP] encodes a leak path exported to a Tier 1 provider by
the leaker, who then passes the leak to a large ISP peer. The

protection afforded by complete Peerlock within the peering
clique vs. current levels is muted in Fig. 11b.
This effect also brings large ISPs to the fore in our simula-
tions. As noted in [33], these networks are densely connected
with peering links. Their connectivity allows them to bypass
the Tier 1 clique for many routes - and makes them the primary
channel for leak propagation. The most common encoding
for every scenario in Table 1 includes a large ISP, and 18/21
of the top encodings transit at least one. More than 70% of
leak segments transit these ASes for all protection scenarios
(see Table 2). In fact, in the scenarios without Peerlock-lite
(top four listed), leak segments on average transit - and could
be ﬁltered by - multiple large ISPs. These statistics motivate
the scenarios that place Peerlock-lite ﬁltering at these ASes
(bottom three in tables).
Interestingly, Peerlock-lite diminishes leak usage and prop-
agation unequally as shown in Fig. 11. Fig. 11a shows about
20% of leak segments propagate to 20% or more of the
topology with large ISP Peerlock-lite deployment, but Fig. 11b
shows that fewer than 5% are installed/exported by at least
20% of ASes. Table 1 hints at why this is the case - a
third or more of leak segments in Peerlock-lite scenarios are
exported to large ISP peers, who propagate them directly into
their customer cones (indicated by [LR]). Large ISPs with
any customer-learned or preferential (e.g. shorter) peer-learned
paths to the leak destination will prefer their existing route,
so the [LR] only includes a subset of the leaker’s peers.
Large ISP peers advertising the leak to customers could reach
many ASes, but as a provider-learned route, the leak will be
disadvantaged in the BGP decision process.
We see in Table 1 and Fig. 11 that small ISPs do not
have the connectivity to propagate leaks globally when the
large ISP provider channel is blocked by Peerlock-lite. Under
all scenarios, most
transit a small
ISP (though they may be transited during propagation into
customer cones). This feature suggests a less prominent role
in route exchange for these networks relative to large ISPs.
leak segments do not
To summarize, we ﬁnd large ISPs are the most critical
players in halting the spread and installation of Tier 1 leaks.
These networks are interconnected enough to globally dissem-
inate route leaks without the peering clique in many cases.
Moreover, adding simple Peerlock-lite ﬁlters at these ASes to
the currently deployed Peerlock ﬁlters in the peering clique
causes a 94% reduction in total leak export across 6,840 leak
simulations. Table 1 suggests that peer connections among
ISPs are the largest remaining vulnerability for Tier 1 leaks
given uniform large ISP Peerlock-lite deployment. These chan-
nels are out of reach for Peerlock-lite as described, but could
be mitigated by 1) additional peering relationships/Peerlock
rules to protect important leak targets and/or 2) complementary
leak prevention systems like IRR ﬁltering.

progress of the leak through the large ISP’s customer cone
would continue to the left of "LR", and the path from leaker
to destination would continue to the right of "TP", but these
segments are omitted as explained above.
We will use two tables in analyzing our results. Table 1 de-
picts the three most common leak encodings for each scenario;
these account for at least a quarter of leak paths regardless
of ﬁlter placement. We also list the sum and percentage of
ASes exporting leaks accounted for by each encoding. Table
2 gives summary statistics for leak segments, including their
average length and the percentage of leak segments transiting
each UCLA class. Because we do not encode customer cone
propagation in leak segments, stubs are transited in <10% of
paths across all protection scenarios, are are omitted from the
table.
First, we observe that even under the "no ﬁlters" scenario,
leaks re-transiting the Tier 1 clique are not the most common
path encoding in Table 1. Table 2 shows they are present
in <35% of leak segments under all scenarios. This result is
an artifact of the BGP decision process; paths learned from
customers are preferred over those exported by peers, and peer
routes are favored over provider-learned ones. So, with all
other selection criteria equal, routes exported from providers
"above" an AS in the topology - e.g. the peering clique -
will generally only be installed and exported if the AS has
not received an update from peers/customers "below". Since
Tier 1 providers cap the routing hierarchy, we expect ASes
will prefer non-Tier 1 routes when provided alternatives by
their connectivity. This dynamic explains why the additional
