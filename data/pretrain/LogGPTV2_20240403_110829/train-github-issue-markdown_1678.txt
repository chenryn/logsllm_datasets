# Environment
    Windows build number: Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18362.239]
    Windows Terminal version (if applicable): 0.2.1831.0
# Steps to reproduce
Open a session to one of the WSL containers. Open midnight commander and start
scrolling with the arrows and tab between panes.
# Expected behavior
No additional characters appearing and disappearing. No changes to the
borders.
# Actual behavior
Visual artifcats that don't seem to depend on the selected font. Both
screensohts use different fonts - one is Inconsolata LGC, the other is
Consolas. What seem to suffer the most are the borders.
