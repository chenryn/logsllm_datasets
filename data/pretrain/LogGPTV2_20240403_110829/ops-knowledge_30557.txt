User: In Twisted when implementing the dataReceived method, there doesn't seem to be any examples which refer to packets being fragmented. In every other language this is something you manually implement, so I was just wondering if this is done for you in twisted already or what? If so, do I need to prefix my packets with a length header? Or do I have to do this manually? If so, what way would that be?
Assistant: You can also use a LineReceiver protocol
