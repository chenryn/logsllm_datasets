When attempting to upload to AppEngine, I encountered the following error message from `appcfg`:

```
This application does not exist (app_id=u'xxx').
```

Initially, I was a developer on the AppEngine project and was only testing. To resolve the issue, I created a new AppEngine project where I was the owner. However, even with the newly created AppEngine, I still received the same error message.

If you are using the `--oauth2` option, ensure that you are logged into the correct Google account when generating the OAuth2 token. This may help resolve the issue.
