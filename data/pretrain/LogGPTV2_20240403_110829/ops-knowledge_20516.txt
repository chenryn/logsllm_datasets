Question: "Consider a proposed design strategy to mitigate input validation issues where all inputs to an application are first canonicalized to a consistent internal representation and then filtered for any unwanted content. What is an advantage and what could be a potential drawback of this approach?"
 "A": "Advantage: It standardizes inputs to a uniform format, reducing the chance of bypassing filters. Drawback: It can introduce additional processing overhead, potentially impacting performance."
 "B": "Advantage: It makes the code more readable and maintainable. Drawback: It may lead to information loss if the canonicalization process is not reversible."
 "C": "Advantage: It can prevent buffer overflow attacks by limiting input size. Drawback: It may not be compatible with all types of encoding schemes used by clients."
 "D": "Advantage: It ensures that all inputs are encrypted before processing. Drawback: It may not be compatible with legacy systems that require specific data formats."
Answer: A
