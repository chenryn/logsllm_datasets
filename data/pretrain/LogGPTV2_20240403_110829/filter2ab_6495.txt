**ATT&CK ID:** T1584.005  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Botnet

Adversaries may compromise a large number of third-party systems to create a botnet, which can be used for various malicious activities. A botnet is a network of compromised devices that can be remotely controlled to perform coordinated tasks. Rather than purchasing or renting a botnet from a booter or stresser service, adversaries may build their own by compromising numerous third-party systems. They may also take over an existing botnet by redirecting the bots to adversary-controlled command and control (C2) servers.

With a botnet at their disposal, adversaries can conduct a range of follow-on activities, including large-scale phishing campaigns and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. These activities can significantly amplify the impact and reach of their operations.
