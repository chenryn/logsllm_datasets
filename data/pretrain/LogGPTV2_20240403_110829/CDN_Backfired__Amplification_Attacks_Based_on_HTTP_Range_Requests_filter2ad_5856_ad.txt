### Amplification Factor of RangeAmp Attacks

The amplification factor for the attack is approximately 53 when Cloudflare is used as the FCDN and Akamai as the BCDN. However, the maximum amplification factor can reach up to 7342 under these conditions. Detailed results are provided in Table V.

### Practicality of RangeAmp Attacks

To avoid disrupting the normal operation of CDNs, we conducted controlled experiments (see Section VI-A). In a real-world scenario, an attacker could continuously and concurrently send multiple range requests to perform the RangeAmp attacks. In an OBR (Origin-Based Range) attack, the targets are specific ingress nodes of the FCDN and BCDN. Due to ethical concerns, we did not launch a real attack to verify the impact on these nodes. In contrast, in an SBR (Server-Based Range) attack, the victim is the origin server, allowing us to evaluate the attack's impact by monitoring the outgoing bandwidth of our origin server.

#### Experiment: SBR Attack Damage to Bandwidth

We conducted an experiment to evaluate the SBR attack's impact on bandwidth. Using Cloudflare as an example, we sent \( m \) concurrent range requests every second for 30 seconds, targeting resources of different sizes. The target resource size was 10MB, and the origin server's outgoing bandwidth was 1000Mbps. We monitored the outgoing bandwidth of the origin server and the incoming bandwidth of the client, varying \( m \) from 1 to 15 to plot the trend of bandwidth consumption over time (Figures 6a and 6b).

- **Figure 6a-6b** shows that regardless of the value of \( m \), the incoming bandwidth consumption of the client remains below 500Kbps. However, the outgoing bandwidth consumption of the origin server increases significantly. For \( m \leq 10 \), the outgoing bandwidth is less than 1000Mbps but nearly proportional to \( m \). When \( m \geq 11 \), the outgoing bandwidth approaches 1000Mbps, and for \( m \geq 14 \), it is completely exhausted.

We performed this experiment on all 13 CDNs, and the results were consistent. Some CDNs, such as Cloudflare and CloudFront, claim to have defenses against DDoS attacks, but no alerts were raised during our experiments using their default configurations.

### Severity Assessment

#### Impact and Vulnerability

- **Amplification Factor**: The amplification factor for SBR attacks is almost proportional to the target resource size, while for OBR attacks, it is proportional to the number of overlapping byte ranges.
- **Vulnerability**: All 13 tested CDNs are vulnerable to SBR attacks, and 11 combinations of cascaded CDNs are vulnerable to OBR attacks. These CDNs are widely used and rank high in market share, exposing many websites and CDN nodes to the RangeAmp vulnerability.

#### Cost and Efficiency

- **Low-Cost Attack**: Unlike traditional DDoS attacks that require large botnets, a RangeAmp attack can be launched from an ordinary laptop. The distributed nature of CDN ingress nodes makes it easy to congest the target network and cause denial of service with minimal cost.

#### Financial Impact

- **Monetary Loss**: Most CDNs charge based on traffic consumption. An opponent can exploit a vulnerable CDN to perform a RangeAmp attack, causing significant financial loss to the targeted website through high CDN service fees.

#### Security Challenge

- **Detection Difficulty**: Traditional DDoS attacks target the victim's incoming bandwidth, whereas RangeAmp attacks primarily consume the victim's outgoing bandwidth. This poses a new challenge for DDoS detection, as vulnerable CDNs do not raise alerts under default configurations.

### Discussion

#### Ethical Considerations

- **Controlled Experiments**: To minimize the risk of degrading CDN performance and causing collateral damage, we conducted controlled experiments. We limited the bandwidth consumption in both time and volume dimensions, and we only sent one range request at a time in the first two experiments. In the third experiment, the target resource size was just 1KB, and in the fourth experiment, we sent requests to different ingress nodes to minimize the impact on specific nodes.
- **Responsible Disclosure**: We disclosed our findings to the relevant CDNs, who responded positively and are working on fixing the vulnerabilities. We also contacted the editors of RFC7233, who advised discussing the RangeAmp threats in the HTTP working group mailing list.

#### Root Cause Analysis

- **RFC Specifications**: The range request mechanism is defined in RFC2616 and updated in RFC7233. However, these specifications lack clear security considerations and restrictions on multi-range requests. This ambiguity, combined with implementation flaws in CDNs, leads to the SBR and OBR attacks.
- **HTTP/2 Protocol**: The latest HTTP/2 protocol cites the definition in HTTP/1.1 without additional security considerations, making RangeAmp threats applicable to HTTP/2 as well.

#### Mitigation Strategies

- **Server Side**: Deploy local DoS defenses, such as filtering requests and limiting bandwidth. However, this may not be effective as attack requests are indistinguishable from benign ones.
- **CDN Side**: Modify the handling of range requests. CDNs can adopt the Laziness policy to defend against SBR attacks or use the Expansion policy with a limited increase in byte range. They should also follow RFC7233 recommendations for multi-range requests.
- **Protocol Side**: Revise the RFC to include more specific security considerations and limits for the Range header, especially for HTTP middle-boxes like CDNs.

### Responsible Disclosure

- **Vendor Response**: We reported all vulnerabilities to the relevant CDN vendors. Most vendors confirmed the vulnerabilities and are working on fixes. StackPath initially did not respond but later contacted us to confirm they had deployed a fix across their edge locations to mitigate the OBR attack.
