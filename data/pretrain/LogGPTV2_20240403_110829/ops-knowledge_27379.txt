User: I am trying to create a duplicate file finder for Windows. My program works well in Linux. But it writes NUL characters to the log file in Windows. This is due to the MBCS default file system encoding of Windows, while the file system encoding in Linux is UTF-8. How can I convert MBCS to UTF-8 to avoid this error?
Assistant: Just change the encode to 'latin-1' (encoding='latin-1')
Using pure Python:
open(..., encoding = 'latin-1')
Using Pandas:
pd.read_csv(..., encoding='latin-1')
