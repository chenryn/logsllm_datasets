### Introduction
We conducted 100 detection tests for 2,000 packet samples of both legitimate traffic and JitterBug traffic. The mean and standard deviation of the test scores are presented in Table 5. For all tests except the entropy test, the scores for JitterBug and legitimate traffic are very close. The distribution of entropy test scores, as shown in Figure 5, reveals a clear distinction between JitterBug and legitimate traffic. The detection rates for JitterBug, as detailed in Table 6, are very low (0.04 or less) for all tests except the entropy test, which has a detection rate of 1.0. Although other tests do detect some differences between JitterBug and legitimate traffic, these differences are too small to be effectively distinguished without a much higher false positive rate.

### Entropy Test Analysis
The entropy test is particularly effective in detecting JitterBug. This test uses a large number of bins with widths determined by the distribution of legitimate traffic. It measures how uniformly the inter-packet delays are distributed with respect to the bins and how well they fit the legitimate traffic distribution. JitterBug introduces small changes throughout the distribution, which fall within the typical variance of legitimate traffic. Tests that measure the maximum distance, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, fail to detect these changes. However, the entropy test is sensitive to such variations. JitterBug increases inter-packet delays and, due to the rotating window, redistributes them in an Equilikely distribution. These changes are not uniform with respect to the legitimate distribution, leading to shifts in the proportion of inter-packet delays for each bin. The entropy test score for JitterBug is lower than that for legitimate traffic, making it easily detectable.

### Absolute Entropy
In absolute terms, the uniform distribution has the maximum entropy among all continuous distributions [9]. However, the entropy test, due to the use of bins, is a relative measure.

### Discussion
The detection tests we present can identify covert timing channels under certain conditions. However, previous methods often fail to detect most covert timing channels, primarily due to the high variation in legitimate traffic. For example, the regularity test, while achieving lower average scores for all covert timing channels, is ineffective due to its high standard deviation in measuring legitimate traffic.

Another reason for the failure of previous methods is the properties of covert traffic. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, for instance, measures the maximum distance between two distributions, making it difficult to differentiate covert traffic from legitimate traffic when their distributions are very similar.

Our entropy-based approach is more effective. By using both entropy and corrected conditional entropy, we can detect small changes in the distribution and the regularity or complexity of the traffic. The entropy test is sensitive to slight changes, but fails if the distribution is nearly identical to legitimate traffic. Conversely, the corrected conditional entropy test measures regularity, making it effective for detecting covert timing channels with abnormal regularity. Combining both tests, our approach can detect a variety of covert timing channels.

### Potential Countermeasures
To evade the corrected conditional entropy test, TRCTC could replay longer correlated sequences of inter-packet delays. However, this would reduce its capacity. To evade the entropy test, JitterBug could use a smaller timing window, but this would also reduce its capacity. The practicality of these countermeasures remains an open question.

### Conclusion and Future Work
We introduced an entropy-based approach for detecting covert timing channels, utilizing both entropy and corrected conditional entropy. Our experimental results show that this combination can detect various covert timing channels, even when their distributions are close to legitimate traffic. Future work will include investigating possible countermeasures and exploring the connection between our detection methods and the entropy related to covert timing channel capacity.
