I have been struggling to replicate my Vim workflow in Atom. In my typical setup, most of my tabs consist of a split view, with one pane for a file and another for its corresponding test file. Here is an example:

![srt_imports.rb | _github_talks/app/concerns/talk - vim](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d39f891b97086db324b1fd6c2cc6f25dcc267e7aba205b085d40af5b4423cff1/68747470733a2f2f662e636c6f75642e6769746875622e636f6d2f6173736574732f31323637362f3839363037342f31393562336566382d666164392d313165322d386263622d3830653835616237616238652e706e67)

This setup allows me to navigate through tabs using the `{` and `}` commands, and within each tab, I can switch between splits using the `[` and `]` commands. The purpose of these splits is to keep related files together, rather than opening them in separate panes or editors.

However, the current modeling of `Pane` and `EditSession` in Atom does not support this workflow. While there are several potential ways to implement this, I encountered difficulties when attempting to modify core components due to elements marked as internal. @kevinsawicki advised me to ignore these warnings, so I plan to gradually work on a solution that meets my needs. He also suggested creating an issue, which is why I am here.

I hope that one of the core developers might see a straightforward way to achieve this. Thank you!
