I have a Vim workflow that I am having trouble recreating in Atom. Most of my
tabs consist of a split, for a file and its tests:
![srt_imports rb _github_talks_app_concerns_talk -
vim](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d39f891b97086db324b1fd6c2cc6f25dcc267e7aba205b085d40af5b4423cff1/68747470733a2f2f662e636c6f75642e6769746875622e636f6d2f6173736574732f31323637362f3839363037342f31393562336566382d666164392d313165322d386263622d3830653835616237616238652e706e67)
Thus I can `{` and `}` my way through tabs and `[` and `]` my way through
splits within them, and all was right with the world. My splits are about
keeping related files together, not separate panes or editors.
The modeling of `Pane` and `EditSession` doesn't really allow this right now.
It's fairly easy to see a number of ways to do it, but I was stymied when I
started to edit core stuff by things marked as internal. @kevinsawicki said to
ignore that, so I'm going to slowly work on something that works for me. But
he also said to make an issue, so here it is. I'm hoping that one of you core
guys sees a super easy way to do it :)
