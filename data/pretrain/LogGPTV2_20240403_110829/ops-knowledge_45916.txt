User: How to realize the fast backup and recovery of the server? What backup and recovery options are available?
Assistant: 1. Quick backup scheme: (1) Snapshot backup: Snapshot backup refers to the snapshot copying of the existing server hard disk, converting the original tedious full backup into fast incremental backup. Support hot backup, you can quickly restore the system. Common disk snapshot technologies include LVM snapshot, ZFS snapshot, VMware snapshot, etc. (2) Backup external hard disk: store the backup data in the external hard disk, directly copy the data to the external hard disk every time it is backed up, and realize incremental backup and differential backup. This backup method has high backup efficiency and data security for businesses with small data volumes. (3) Cloud backup: Cloud backup is a way to store server data backups on the cloud platform. Through the backup software or tools provided by the cloud service provider, charge a certain fee to realize fast backup. 2. Quick recovery plan: (1) Hardware recovery: restore the previously backed up data to the same type of hardware device to achieve the purpose of quickly restoring business functions. (2) Remote backup and recovery: When the server hardware is damaged or a network failure occurs and cannot continue to work, the backup data can be restored to a new server through remote backup and recovery of data. Get back into business quickly and safely. (3) Mirror image recovery: The server system is made into an ISO image, and the system can be quickly restored if a system failure occurs, which is convenient for maintenance and backup.
