### Challenges in Navigating Regulatory Standards for Developers

Developers often struggle to identify and enumerate all the relevant standards that apply to their applications. A practical solution is to direct them to a single, authoritative, non-legal guidance document that consolidates many standards into a list of actionable insights. This approach allows developers to follow these insights without needing to delve into other regulations or guidance documents.

**Figure 1:** Non-legal, authoritative guidance documents balance the challenges posed by broadly applicable regulations and unique individual circumstances.

### Open-Ended vs. Concrete Requirements

One key challenge is that laws are often intentionally open-ended to remain relevant as technology evolves. However, auditors require specific requirements to check. While one solution is to write more specific laws, this is not always feasible. Another approach is to use authoritative, non-legal supporting documents, such as FDA guidance documents, which clarify regulatory intent. These documents, lacking the full weight of the law, allow regulators like the FDA, standards organizations like NIST, and industry groups to provide more concrete recommendations while keeping the law flexible.

### Application-Specific Solutions vs. General Standards

There is a fundamental tension between allowing OEMs to define their own defense profiles and requiring a general standard. **Figure 2** shows out-bound citations for eleven FDA guidance documents.

### Translation and Compliance Verification

As discussed in Section III, several key challenges make it difficult to translate regulatory requirements into a computation-friendly format. Existing work has achieved some success using ML and NLP techniques, but these may only be effective in certain legal domains. Our key observation is that translating "middleware" (i.e., non-legal, authoritative guidance documents that clarify regulatory intent) can help bridge the gap between an open-ended, flexible legal framework and a descriptive regulatory environment that can be operationalized into a computational auditor. These clarifying documents may already be produced by regulatory bodies or independently developed by standards organizations and industry groups.

In the mHealth space, we operationalized the security recommendations from the 2018 FDA draft guidance document, "Content of Premarket Submissions for Management of Cybersecurity in Medical Devices." As shown in Table 1, these recommendations can be grouped into five categories: user authentication, authentication of safety-critical functions, data integrity, execution integrity, and detection of cybersecurity incidents. We collected 182 FDA/CE-approved mHealth apps from Healthskouts in February 2021 and used our analysis framework to audit their compliance with these FDA recommendations.

### Analysis of Warnings

Warnings were manually analyzed. One common type of warning was the presence of hard-coded keys. Twenty-five apps hard-coded OAuth secrets, and seventeen apps hard-coded API keys, which can be extracted and used for malicious purposes. Seven apps hard-coded cryptographic keys for pairing or inter-device communication. Additionally, four apps hard-coded Android Keystore passwords, and three apps hard-coded SQLite database keys.

### Conclusion

In this project, we propose a new approach to building automatic auditors for legal compliance. Our key observation is that translating non-legal, authoritative guidance documents that clarify regulatory intent can be more effective than directly operationalizing legal text. This approach leverages the benefits of an open-ended, flexible legal framework and a descriptive regulatory environment that can be translated into a computational auditor. These documents may already be available from regulatory bodies or can be created independently by standards organizations and industry groups. We applied our principles to create an auditor and tested it on existing FDA/CE-approved mHealth apps. Our research suggests that the use of these non-legal, authoritative guidance documents is a promising approach for computational auditing.

### Responsible Disclosure

We have not publicly disclosed the vulnerabilities and are working with individual app vendors to fix them.
