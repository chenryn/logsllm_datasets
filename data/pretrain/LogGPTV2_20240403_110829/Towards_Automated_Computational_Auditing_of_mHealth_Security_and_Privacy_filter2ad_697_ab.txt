of these documents; it can be hard for developers to enumerate all
of the relevant standards that apply to their application.
It may be helpful, then, to direct developers to a single, authori-
tative, non-legal, guidance document that distills many standards
into a list of actionable insights. Developers satisfied with these
insights may not need to explore other regulations or guidance
documents.
Figure 1: Non-legal, authoritative, guidance documents bal-
ance the challenges raised by broadly applicable regulations
and unique individual circumstances
Open-ended vs. concrete requirements: One key challenge
is that the law is often open-ended by design; by avoiding specificity,
the law remains relevant, even as technology evolves. However,
auditors require specific requirements to check. One solution to this
problem is to write more-specific laws, though we are unlikely to
realize greater specificity in all areas of the law. Another solution is
to use authoritative, but non-legal, supporting documents that clar-
ify regulatory intent, like FDA guidance documents. Because these
documents do not have the full weight of the law behind them, they
allow regulators like the FDA, standards organizations like NIST,
and industry groups to provide more-concrete recommendations
while leaving the law open-ended.
Application-specific solutions vs. general standards: There
is a fundamental tension between giving OEMs more power to de-
fine their own defense profiles and requiring a general standard

4 TRANSLATION AND COMPLIANCE
VERIFICATION
As discussed in Section III, there are a few key challenges that make
it difficult to translate regulatory requirements into a computation-
friendly format. Existing work has achieved some success by ap-
plying ML and NLP [25]. However, these techniques may only be
effective in some legal domains. Our key observation is that by
translating not the legal text itself but “middleware” (i.e., non-legal,
authoritative, guidance documents that clarify regulatory intent),
we may be able to enjoy both the benefits of an open-ended, flexible
legal framework and a descriptive regulatory environment that
can be operationalized into a computational auditor. These clarify-
ing documents may already be produced by regulatory bodies and
can be independently developed by standards organizations and
industry groups.
In the mHealth space, we operationalized the security recom-
mendations in the 2018 FDA draft guidance document Content of
Premarket Submissions for Management of Cybersecurity in Medical
Devices. As shown in Table 1, the recommendations in this doc-
ument can be grouped into five categories: user authentication,
authentication of safety-critical functions, data integrity, execution
integrity, and the detection of cybersecurity incidents. We collected
182 FDA/CE-approved mHealth apps from healthskouts1 in Febru-
ary 2021 and used our analysis framework to audit their compliance
with these FDA recommendations.
Warnings were then manually analyzed. One common type of
warning was the presence of hard-coded keys. Twenty-five apps
hard-coded OAuth secrets and seventeen apps hard-coded API keys;
these keys can be extracted and used for malicious purposes. Seven
apps hard-coded cryptographic keys for pairing or inter-device
communication. Finally, four apps hard-coded Android Keystore
passwords and three apps hard-coded SQLite database keys.
5 CONCLUSION
In this project, we propose a new way to build automatic audi-
tors for legal compliance. Our key observation is that instead of

operationalizing legal text itself, we may find more success by
translating non-legal, authoritative, guidance documents that clar-
ify regulatory intent. By doing so, we enjoy both the benefits of an
open-ended, flexible legal framework and a descriptive regulatory
environment that can be translated into a computational auditor.
These documents may already be available from regulatory bod-
ies. Alternatively, standards organizations and industry groups can
create them independently. We applied our principles to create an
auditor and tested it on existing FDA/CE-approved mHealth apps.
Our research suggests that the use of these non-legal, authoritative,
guidance documents is a promising approach for computational
auditing.
