User: How to ensure the reliability and security of the database to prevent data leakage and loss?
Assistant: 1. Database backup and disaster recovery Regularly perform database backup so that recovery can be performed quickly in case of an accident. At the same time, a corresponding disaster recovery plan needs to be developed and regularly tested to ensure its feasibility. 2. Database access control Implement strict access control on sensitive data in the database to ensure that only authorized users can access it, and set different permissions and operation restrictions for users of different levels. 3. Database encryption encrypts sensitive data in the database to keep it safe during storage and transmission. Commonly used encryption techniques include symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption. 4. Security Vulnerability Scanning and Repair Regularly conduct security vulnerability scanning to discover and repair the loopholes in time to prevent hackers from using these loopholes to attack and steal data. 5. Log monitoring and auditing Monitor and audit the operation records of the database, and timely alarm and deal with abnormal operations to ensure data security. 6. Database permission review Regularly review and adjust database permissions to prevent data leakage and misoperation due to improper permission configuration. 7. Database monitoring Through real-time monitoring of the operating status and data changes of the database, abnormal situations can be found and dealt with in time, thereby ensuring the stability and security of the database.
