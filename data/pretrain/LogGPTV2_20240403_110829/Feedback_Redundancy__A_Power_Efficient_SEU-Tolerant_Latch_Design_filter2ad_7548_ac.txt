point  (node  N3).  Consequently  the  transient  voltage 
occurred in the output (node N3) is latched regardless of 
the strength of the particle. It also can be seen from the 
If a transient occurs in the output node in this state, its 
value will become "0" and also the value of node N1 will 
become "0" so that the transistors T1 and T2 become on 
and  the  value  of  node  N4  changes  to  "1".  Since  the 
transistors  T3  and  T4  are  off  in  this  state,  the  node  N5 
keeps its previous value i.e., "0". Therefore transistors T6 
and T7 switch to the on-state and transistors T5 and  T8 
enter into the off-state, hence the C-element falls into the 
filtering mode and never change its mode until a new data 
is written to the latch. That is, if a voltage drop or rise due 
to  a  SEU  occurs  in  the  output  of  the  mentioned  latch, 
there  is  no  possibility  to  recover  the  output  value

and an incorrect value will be latched. The SEU-injection 
results shown in Figure 15 confirm this matter. 
Some other SEU-tolerant latch techniques such as [11], 
[16]  are  based  on  increasing  the  size  of  the  equivalent 
capacitance  of  internal  susceptible  nodes  by  using  some 
redundant  transistors.  These  techniques  just  mitigate  the 
SEU  effect  but  still  it  is  probable  that  a  high  energy 
particle causes a soft error in the latch. In principle, these 
techniques  are  based  on  the  fact  that  if  the  size  of 
equivalent capacitance of the internal nodes increases the 
probability  of  a  SEU  causes  a  soft  error  in  a  memory 
element will decrease. That is because, the SEU causes a 
soft  error  by  discharging  the  internal  capacitance  of  the 
latch  and  if  the  size  of  the  internal  capacitance  is 
increased,  the  probability  of  a  SEU  caused  a  soft  error 
will  be  decreased.  However,  increasing  the  internal 
capacitance  of  the  latch  results  in  a  rise  in  the  latch 
propagation  delay  which  imposes  performance  overhead 
to  the  system.  The  Schematics  of  the  proposed  SEU-
tolerant  latch  in  [16]  which  is  based  on  the  mentioned 
technique, is depicted in Figure 16. The simulation results 
are also demonstrated in Figure 17. The results show that

so that both feedback lines will be disjointed. On the other 
hand, the value of node N3 differs from the value of node 
N4 and this also makes the C-element 3 be in its filtering 
mode. Thus, the injected SEU effect cannot pass through 
the output. The SEU-injection results in Figure 18.b show 
that although the value of node N3 is not recovered but 
the output of the latch is still correct. 
4. Performance and Power Analysis 
Since  fault-tolerant  techniques  use  redundancy,  some 
power, area and performance overheads may be imposed 
to  the  systems  i.e.,  the  more  fault  tolerance  is  achieved, 
the more overheads is imposed to the system. Therefore, 
the  evaluation  of  such  overheads 
to 
demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of  a  technique.  The  area 
overhead  is  directly  proportional  to  the  number  of  used 
transistor,  in  the  proposed  technique,  24  transistors  are 
used  while  the  number  of  required  transistors  in  TMR-
latch 
latch  occupies 
approximately 42% less area than the TMR-latch. 
is  42.  Thus 
the  proposed

The  power  consumption  of  a  VLSI  system  can  be 
subdivided  into  two  main  components:  dynamic  power 
and  leakage  power.  Until  recently  dynamic  power  has 
been 
the  power  consumption. 
However,  in  deep-submicron  CMOS,  the  technology 
shrinkage causes transistor sub-threshold leakage current 
to increase exponentially which results in a corresponding 
increase  in  leakage  power,  so  that  the  leakage  power 
becomes comparable to the dynamic power  [17] [30]. 
Figure 16. The proposed latch in [16] 
although  the  use  of  extra  p-  and  n-type  transistors 
increases the size of equivalent capacitance in susceptible 
nodes (nodes N1 and N2) but still a high voltage drop due 
to a high energy particle can be propagated to the output. 
3.3 Reliability Analysis of the Proposed Latch 
Based  on  the  SEU-injection  simulation  results,  all  of 
the previously proposed SEU-tolerant latches have at least 
one  susceptible  node  in  which  the  SEU  effect  can  be 
propagated  to  the  output,  resulting  in  a  soft  error  in  the 
latch. 
To address this issue, in the proposed latch a feedback 
path  along  with  a  C-element  are  used  to  form  a  fully 
isolated feedback line. The simulation results (Figure 18) 
show that the proposed latch masks the effect of SEUs in 
all fault injection sites which are nodes N1, N2, N3 and 
N4  (see  Figure  2).  It  should  be  considered  that  two 
feedbacks in the proposed design are the same. Thus only 
the  fault  injection  results  of  nodes  N1  and  N3  are 
reported. 
The SEU-injections are preformed both for the SEUs 
that cause a voltage drop and those cause a voltage rise in 
susceptible  nodes,  but  for  the  sake  of  simplicity  only 
some  of  the  SEU-injection  results  are  reported.  Figure 
18.a shows that a voltage drop in node 1, due to the SEU 
injection, is filtered by the C-element 1 (see Figure 2) and 
the transient cannot be propagated to the node N3. Node 
N1  is  also  recovered  by  the  correct  value  in  node  N3 
through the feedback line. The SEU-injection to node N3 
is  also  represented  in  Figure  18.b.  The  SEU  causes  a 
voltage  rise  in  node  N3  and  this  transient  propagates  to 
the node N1 which is connected to C-elements 1 and 2. 
As  the  two  inputs  of  the  C-elements  become  different, 
these two C-elements filter the effect of the injected SEU

technologies (note that the results are normalized by the 
TMR-latch  propagation  delay).  Figure  21  represents  the 
power delay product values for different technology sizes. 
As shown the performance overhead of the proposed latch 
is almost the same as the TMR-latch. It is evident that the 
amount of power delay product is reduced significantly in 
the proposed latch in comparison with TMR-latch. 
5. Conclusions 
In this paper a novel SEU-tolerant latch was designed 
and evaluated. In the proposed latch, redundant feedback 
lines were used to mask the effects of SEUs.
