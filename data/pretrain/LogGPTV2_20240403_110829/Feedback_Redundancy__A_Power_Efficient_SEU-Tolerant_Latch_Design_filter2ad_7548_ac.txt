### Transient Voltage and SEU Impact on Latch Outputs

When a transient voltage occurs at the output (node N3), it is latched, regardless of the particle's strength. This can be observed from the following: if a transient event happens at the output node in this state, its value will change to "0," and the value of node N1 will also become "0." As a result, transistors T1 and T2 turn on, and the value of node N4 changes to "1." Since transistors T3 and T4 are off in this state, node N5 retains its previous value, i.e., "0." Consequently, transistors T6 and T7 switch to the on-state, while transistors T5 and T8 enter the off-state. This transition causes the C-element to enter the filtering mode, where it remains until new data is written to the latch.

If a voltage drop or rise due to a Single Event Upset (SEU) occurs at the output of the latch, the output value cannot be recovered. This is illustrated in Figure 11, which shows the SEU injection results for the proposed latch in [9].

### SEU-Tolerant Latch Techniques

Some SEU-tolerant latch techniques, such as those in [11] and [16], involve increasing the equivalent capacitance of internal susceptible nodes using redundant transistors. These methods mitigate the SEU effect but do not completely prevent soft errors caused by high-energy particles. The principle behind these techniques is that increasing the capacitance of internal nodes reduces the probability of a SEU causing a soft error, as the SEU discharges the internal capacitance. However, increasing the internal capacitance also increases the latch propagation delay, leading to performance overheads. The schematic of the SEU-tolerant latch in [16] and its simulation results are shown in Figures 16 and 17, respectively.

### Reliability Analysis of the Proposed Latch

Based on SEU-injection simulation results, all previously proposed SEU-tolerant latches have at least one susceptible node where the SEU effect can propagate to the output, resulting in a soft error. To address this, the proposed latch uses a feedback path and a C-element to form a fully isolated feedback line. Simulation results (Figure 18) show that the proposed latch masks the SEU effect in all fault injection sites, including nodes N1, N2, N3, and N4. Only the fault injection results for nodes N1 and N3 are reported, as the two feedbacks in the design are identical.

SEU injections were performed for both voltage drops and rises in susceptible nodes. Figure 18.a shows that a voltage drop in node N1, due to SEU injection, is filtered by C-element 1, preventing the transient from propagating to node N3. Node N1 is then recovered by the correct value in node N3 through the feedback line. Figure 18.b illustrates an SEU injection to node N3, causing a voltage rise. This transient propagates to node N1, connected to C-elements 1 and 2. As the two inputs of the C-elements become different, they filter the SEU effect, ensuring the output remains correct.

### Performance and Power Analysis

Fault-tolerant techniques often introduce power, area, and performance overheads. The more fault tolerance achieved, the higher the overheads. Evaluating these overheads is essential to demonstrate the effectiveness of a technique. The proposed latch uses 24 transistors, compared to 42 in a Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) latch, resulting in a 42% reduction in area.

The power consumption of a VLSI system consists of dynamic power and leakage power. Historically, dynamic power has been the main component of power consumption. However, in deep-submicron CMOS, technology shrinkage has led to an exponential increase in sub-threshold leakage current, making leakage power comparable to dynamic power.

### Conclusions

This paper presents a novel SEU-tolerant latch design that uses redundant feedback lines to mask the effects of SEUs. The proposed latch effectively filters SEU-induced transients and maintains the correct output value, even under high-energy particle impacts.
