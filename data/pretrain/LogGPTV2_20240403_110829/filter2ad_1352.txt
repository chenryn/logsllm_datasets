## 1. Workshop Introduction
The intrinsic security of computer architectures and processor implementations has often been overlooked, either unintentionally or deliberately, in favor of high performance and low cost. Traditional approaches to computer security have focused on patching vulnerable software ecosystems while still running them on flawed hardware, hoping to mitigate attacks with reduced exploitable errors, additional security checks, and constrained environments. However, without addressing the underlying hardware issues and incorporating security-oriented features, defending current software systems solely through software measures is a losing battle.

Recent vulnerabilities like Meltdown and Spectre highlight that fundamental optimizations, such as speculative execution, can become significant security risks. These vulnerabilities are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to fix without altering the underlying hardware designs. Therefore, it is essential for future designs of computer architectures and processors to prioritize security from the outset, providing crucial support for security-related software and improving system security systematically.

This workshop aims to discuss research on defending computer systems with security-oriented features in ISA extensions, processor architectures, cache hierarchies, on-chip communication systems, and peripheral devices. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
1. Security-oriented processor designs and optimizations.
2. Hardware techniques for defending against cache side-channels.
3. Hardware techniques for mitigating Meltdown and Spectre.
4. Security in IoT hardware infrastructure.
5. Security hardware in big data and cloud environments.
6. Secure architecture and microarchitecture.
7. Built-in architecture for security design.
