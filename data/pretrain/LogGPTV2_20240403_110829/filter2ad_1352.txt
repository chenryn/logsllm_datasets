ABSTRACT
The theme of this workshop is security-oriented computer systems
designs and optimizations. And through this workshop, we hope to
explore more secure computer systems for PCs, Servers, IoT nodes,
and more.
CCS CONCEPTS
• Security and privacy → Security in hardware; Systems se-
curity; • Computer systems organization → Architectures;

1 WORKSHOP INTRODUCTION
The intrinsic security of computer architectures and the imple-
mentations of processors has long been unintentionally or even
deliberately overlooked and traded for optimizations seeking for
high performance and low cost. Traditional wisdom about com-
puter security is to patch the vulnerable software eco-systems but
still let them run on existing flawed computers in the hope to fend
off attacker with reduced exploitable errors, extra security checks
and constrained running environment. However, without fixing
the underlying errors and in the absence of security-oriented fea-
tures in processor designs, defending the current software systems
by the software along is doomed to be a losing battle. The recent
Meltdown and Spectre attacks demonstrate that some of the fun-
damental optimizations, such as speculative execution, have the
potential to be or already become security vulnerabilities which
are extremely difficult, if ever possible, to fix without changing
the underlying hardware designs. It becomes necessary for future
designs of computer architectures and processors to consider se-
curity early in the design process and provide crucial supports for

security related software; therefore, improve the system security
in a systematic manner.
This workshop discusses all the related research on defending
computer systems with security-oriented features in ISA extensions,
processors architectures, cache hierarchies, on-chip communication
systems and peripheral devices. Topics of interest include but are
not limited to:
(1) Security-oriented processor designs and optimizations.
(2) Hardware techniques in defending cache side-channels.
(3) Hardware techniques in defending Meltdown and Spectre.
(4) Security in IoT hardware infrastructure.
(5) Security hardware in Big data and Cloud.
(6) Secure architecture and microarchitecture.
(7) Build-in Architecture for security design.
