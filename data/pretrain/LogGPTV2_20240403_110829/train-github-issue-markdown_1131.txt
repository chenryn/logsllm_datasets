This issue can be quite easily understood from the source of the carousel's
pause method. It is the this.cycle() that is the problem. Since that is run
without any argument, it sets this.paused to false, effectively undoing what
was just set a few lines before. Then the next time cycle fires with an event,
like mouseexit, it will actually start cycling. So, this.cycle needs to be
called with some argument.  
pause: function (e) {  
if (!e) this.paused = true  
if (this.$element.find('.next, .prev').length && $.support.transition.end) {  
this.$element.trigger($.support.transition.end)  
this.cycle()  
}  
clearInterval(this.interval)  
this.interval = null  
return this  
}
