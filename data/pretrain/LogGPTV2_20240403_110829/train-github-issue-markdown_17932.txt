@fchollet and other Keras contributors,

When working with large datasets, such as ImageNet, it is common practice to create a custom data generator that yields batches of data (typically as `numpy.array`) from disk. This allows us to train our models using the `model.fit_generator()` method.

However, if we also want to perform online data augmentation using `ImageDataGenerator`, what is the most straightforward way to implement this? Specifically, I would like to use the `flow()` method instead of `flow_from_directory()`.

Thank you for your guidance.
