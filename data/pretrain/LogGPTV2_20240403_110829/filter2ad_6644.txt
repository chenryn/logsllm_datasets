ABSTRACT
The business relationships between the Autonomous Sys-
tems (ASes) play a central role in the BGP routing. The ex-
isting relationship inference algorithms are profoundly based
on the valley-free rule and generalize their inference heuris-
tics for both the IPv4 and IPv6 planes, introducing unavoid-
able inference artifacts. To discover and analyze the Type-
of-Relationship (ToR) properties of the IPv6 topology we
mine the BGP Communities attribute which provides an
unexploited wealth of reliable relationship information. We
obtain the actual relationships for 72% of the IPv6 AS links
that are visible in the RouteViews and RIPE RIS reposi-
tories. Our results show that as many as 13% of AS links
that serve both IPv4 and IPv6 traﬃc have diﬀerent rela-
tionships depending on the IP version. Such relationships
are characterized as hybrid. We observe that links with hy-
brid relationships are present in a large number of IPv6 AS
paths. Furthermore, an unusually large portion of IPv6 AS
paths violate the valley-free rule, indicating that the global
reachability in the IPv6 Internet requires the relaxation of
the valley-free rule. Our work highlights the importance of
correctly inferring the AS relationships and the need to ap-
preciate the distinct characteristics of IPv6 routing policies.

AS relationships are usually treated as conﬁdential. A
number of algorithms [1, 2, 4] have been proposed to infer
the Type-of-Relationship (ToR) between ASes, utilizing a
variety of heuristics. Their common ground is the valley-free
property [1], according to which an AS path is valid only if
it has one of the following formats: (1) n × c2p + m × p2c,
or (2) n × c2p + p2p + m × p2c, where n, m (cid:62) 0.
The existing ToR algorithms analyze the IPv4 and IPv6
AS links using exactly the same principles. However, the AS
links carrying IPv6 traﬃc may follow unconventional BGP
routing policies, including relaxed peering requirements and
even free IPv6 transit. These distinct policies may result in
AS links with diﬀerent relationship type between the IPv4
and the IPv6 Internet. Such relationships are called hybrid
IPv4/IPv6 relationships and cannot be captured by the ex-
isting ToR algorithms. Hence, measurement artifacts are
unavoidable under the current ToR inference approaches.
To rigorously analyze the IPv6 AS relationships and de-
tect the hybrid relationships we rely on the BGP Commu-
nities relationship information [3], and the Local Preference
(LocPrf) attribute. We utilize the metric of “customer tree”
[2] to assess the impact of hybrid links on the IPv6 routing
structure.
2. DATA COLLECTION METHODOLOGY
The Communities attribute tags a BGP advertisement
with additional information. Communities values are not
standardized but the Internet Routing Registries (IRR) pro-
vide abundant information on their interpretation. Only
Communities that describe relationship types and traﬃc-
engineering requests are relevant to our analysis (the latter
to facilitate the interpretation of LocPrf values).
LocPrf expresses the degree of preference that an AS has
to a certain route. Usually LocPrf are ordered as follows:
LocP rfcustomer > LocP rfpeer > LocP rfprovider. However,
LocPrf can be adjusted to any value for traﬃc engineering
purposes.
The Communities relationships function as the Rosetta
Stone for the LocPrf values. A LocPrf value is assigned to a

relationship type only if we can validate it from the collected
Communities. The traﬃc engineering Communities allow us
to detect and ﬁlter-out LocPrf values used for non-standard
preference tuning of speciﬁc paths.
3. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS
We collect daily BGP data from RouteViews and RIPE
RIS repositories to extract the IPv6 AS paths and AS links.
In August 2010, there are 346,649 IPv6 AS paths and 10,535
IPv6 AS links. 7,618 IPv6 AS links are also visible in the
IPv4 topology. From the Community and the Local Pref-
erence attributes we are able to extract the actual AS rela-
tionship for 72% (7,651) of the all IPv6 links and for 81%
(6,160) of the IPv4/IPv6 links. We have a number of inter-
esting observations.
Firstly, 779 (or 13%) of the IPv4/IPv6 links have hybrid
AS relationships. 67% of such hybrid links have a peering
relationship for IPv4 and a transit relationship for IPv6; the
rest are p2p for IPv6 and p2c for IPv4, except a single case
where the two ASes have a p2c for IPv4 and a c2p for IPv6.
Secondly, the hybrid links usually happen among tier-1 or
tier-2 ASes with large numbers of connections. As a result
the hybrid links have a high visibility in IPv6 AS paths.
More than 28% of the IPv6 paths contain at least one IPv4/
IPv6 link with hybrid AS relationships.
Thirdly, 13% of the IPv6 paths do not follow the valley-
free rule. We call them the valley paths. The large number of
IPv6 valley paths is a major reason underlying the inference
errors of the existing ToR algorithms. Our analysis indicates
that 16% of the valley paths are due to the relaxation of
the valley-free rule in order to expand the reachability of
IPv6 preﬁxes. The IPv6 topology is partitioned in terms of
valley-free routing 1 and the relaxation of the valley-free rule
is necessary in some cases to maintain IPv6 reachability.
4. DISCUSSION
The substantial existence of hybrid IPv4/IPv6 links sug-
gests that the IPv4 and IPv6 Internet topologies should be
studied separately. This is consistent with our recent study
on the evolution of IPv4 and IPv6 AS topologies [5].
1An example is the peering dispute between two transit-free
ASes in the IPv6 plane, AS6939 and AS174, as described
in

and the diameter of the IPv6 AS customer trees
as we gradually correct the misinferred relationship
of the 20 hybrid AS relationships with the highest
visibility in the IPv6 AS paths.
The ToR-annotated AS topology is very sensitive to mis-
inference of AS relationship. An expressive metric to assess
the impact of misinferred relationships is the “customer tree”
of an AS (root), which contains all the ASes that the root
can reach through p2c links. Figure 1 shows an example
where the change of relationship between two ASes results
in two diﬀerent topologies. We ﬁnd that when we replace
the IPv6 AS relationships that were misinferred in [4] with
the correct relationships inferred from the BGP Communi-
ties, the average length and the longest length (diameter) of
the shortest valley-free AS paths of the union of the IPv6
customer trees are reduced from 3.8 to 2.23, and from 11 to
7 hops, respectively (Figure 2).
In summary, our results reveal substantial diﬀerences be-
tween the IPv4 and IPv6 relationships, including a signiﬁ-
cant number of IPv6 paths that are not valley-free, some-
times in exchange for better reachability. The IPv6 topology
should be studied separately using new models that capture
its distinct characteristics. Our future work will validate
and expand our inference results, investigate the reasons for
hybrid links and revisit the valley-free rule. Our dataset and
more details are available at the project’s website [6].
