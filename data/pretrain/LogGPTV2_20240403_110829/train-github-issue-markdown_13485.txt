CSS for Table is a little wonky when viewed in IE 11 most egregious issues are
TableFooter and TableRow do not respect the padding or spacing
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Should be a similar if not identical look and feel across all browsers
## Current Behavior
First column of table is always expanded to take up the empty width of the
parent div  
Footer aligns left and pagination drop down overlaps text

## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Open link in IE 11 https://material-ui.com/demos/tables/
## Context

compared to the issue with the TableFooter
