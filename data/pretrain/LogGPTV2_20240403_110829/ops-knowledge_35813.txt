User: I created a Hello World website in Google App Engine. It is using Django 1.1 without any patch.
Even though it is just a very simple web page, it takes long time and often it times out.
Any suggestions to solve this?
Note: It is responding fast after the first call.
Assistant: If it's responding quickly after the first request, it's probably just a case of getting the relevant process up and running. Admittedly it's slightly surprising that it takes so long that it times out. Is this after you've updated the application and verified that the AppEngine dashboard shows it as being ready?
"First hit slowness" is quite common in many web frameworks. It's a bit of a pain during development, but not a problem for production.
