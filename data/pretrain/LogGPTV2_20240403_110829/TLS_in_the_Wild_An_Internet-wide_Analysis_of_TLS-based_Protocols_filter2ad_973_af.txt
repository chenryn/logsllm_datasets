### Analysis of Certificates and Findings

#### SMTP on Port 25
- **Certificate for `*.bizmw`**: Contains the string 'NTT Communications Corporation' in the 'Organization' part of the subject, indicating the use of these invalid certificates within NTT Communications.
- **Certificate for `localhost` (marked with an asterisk)**: Contains the string 'Qmail Toaster Server', suggesting the use of Qmail by djb. This indicates that proper certificates were not installed.
- **'Webaster' Certificate**: Appeared in the Web PKI study [24] and is likely due to a certificate creation software with a spelling weakness.
- **Plesk**: The company behind the Parallels visualization product.

#### IMAPS
- **'Webaster' Certificate**: Also found in IMAPS.
- **Certificates of Hosting Companies and Hurricane Electric**: Found in the dataset.
- **Microsoft Certificates**: Contained a web address for the Windows Update service, which was unexpected. There were 18,193 occurrences of this single end-host certificate across 15 Autonomous Systems (ASes). None of the ASes were registered to Microsoft; they were predominantly assigned to hosters. Only two ASes were not on the CIRCL list of known botnet and malicious activity.

#### XMPP Certificates
- **OneX**: An XMPP server by Avaya, likely a default certificate.
- **Fonality**: A provider of unified messaging.
- **k66.ru**: Certificates contained a string referring to a product called 'CommuniGate'.
- **Clickmyheart**: A login portal, possibly a forum.
- **Zimbra Collaboration Server**: Name found in some certificates.
- **John Doe**: Used in certificates by Jive Software.
- **Java2go**: An SMS product.

### Poor CA Practice
- **Directly Issued Certificates from Root CA**: Found in our dataset, though the industry has moved away from this practice. For SMTP, only 794 cases (0.07% of verifiable chains) were found. For SUBMISSION, it was 0.08%, and for SMTPS, it was 0.5%.

### Authentication Methods
- **SUBMISSION and IMAPS**:
  - **PLAIN and LOGIN**: Supported by more than 99% of SUBMISSION servers and 90% of IMAPS servers.
  - **CRAM**: Supported by less than 16% of SUBMISSION servers and 12.04% of IMAPS servers.
  - **Combination of Mechanisms**: Most servers support only PLAIN and LOGIN, leading to the use of plaintext mechanisms in at least 96.19% of SUBMISSION and 89.35% of IMAPS cases.

### Passive Data Collection
- **Authentication Mechanisms Offered Before STARTTLS**:
  - **PLAIN and LOGIN**: 39.87% of all servers offer only these mechanisms.
  - **Connections**: 4.94% of connections contain information about authentication mechanisms before STARTTLS, but 3.51% of all observed connections contain only plaintext authentication mechanisms.

### Conclusion
The findings suggest that a number of default keys and certificates are used in production, which is concerning as it means other parties may have access to the private cryptographic material. Some vendors seem to choose their own, private CA instead of working with a commercial one. Additionally, the poor support for strong authentication mechanisms and the widespread use of plaintext mechanisms pose significant security risks.
