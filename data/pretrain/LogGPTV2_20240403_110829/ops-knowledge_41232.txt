User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题SQL - an error occurred during the pre-login handshake Until yesterday evening, I was able to connect to my server from my local machine. Now, I get the following error:

A connection was successfully established with the server, but then an error occurred during the pre-login handshake. (provider: SSL Provider, error: 0 - The wait operation timed out.) (.Net SqlClient Data Provider)

Note, I can log on to the actual server with no problem.

Yesterday, I installed IIS on my machine and set up a site using my IP address - don't know if this has anything to do.

I did come across this article, followed the steps, but didn't seem to help.

I also went through the following article, changed TC/IP settings, restarted, but nothing.

Started trying suggestions from comments too but stopped when I realized I might be messing things up more.

So, why is this happening / how can I fix?

  Sick of the problem? Dont know or care what winsock is or any of this
  low level crap means.
  
  Go to a command prompt

  netsh Winsock reset
