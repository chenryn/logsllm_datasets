# Developing Dynamic Packaging Applications

## Chapter I: Developing Dynamic Packaging Applications using Semantic Web-Based Integration

**Jorge Cardoso, Universidade da Madeira, Portugal**

### Abstract
Dynamic packaging is an innovative technology that enables the automated online configuration and assembly of travel packages for individual customers. These applications require the seamless integration of heterogeneous, autonomous, and distributed tourism information systems, which poses a significant challenge. The Semantic Web, a relatively new concept, offers a set of emerging technologies and models that can enhance the integration of such systems. In this chapter, we analyze the requirements of dynamic packaging applications and present an architecture that leverages semantic annotation, semantic rules, ontologies, Web services, and Web processes to integrate tourism data sources and create dynamic packages. We conclude that the Semantic Web is a promising solution for overcoming the interoperability issues faced by current dynamic packaging applications.

### Introduction
Tourism has become one of the world's largest industries, with consistent year-over-year growth. The World Tourism Organization predicts that tourist arrivals will increase by over 200% by 2020. The industry's competitiveness is increasingly driven by science, information technology, and innovation.

The widespread use of the Internet has transformed the world into a global village, with e-tourism websites providing a wealth of information, maps, pictures, sounds, and services about destinations worldwide. According to Forrester, B2B revenues are expected to reach $8.8 trillion in 2005, and B2C revenues in the U.S. will reach $229.9 billion by 2008.

The Internet is now the primary source of information for travelers, with 95% of users gathering travel-related information online and 93% visiting tourism websites when planning vacations. The number of people using the Internet for travel planning has increased by more than 300% over the past five years, outpacing traditional information sources. E-tourism extends existing business models, reduces costs, and introduces new distribution channels, making it crucial for tourism businesses to adopt and leverage information technology.

Barnett and Standing (2001) argue that the rapidly changing business environment necessitates quick implementation of new business models, development of new networks and alliances, and creative marketing. Businesses must use technology-mediated channels, create internal and external value, formulate convergent strategies, and organize resources around knowledge and relationships (Rayport & Jaworski, 2001).

Tourism Information Systems (TIS) serve and support e-tourism and e-travel, including airlines, hotels, car rentals, leisure suppliers, and travel agencies. These systems rely on travel-related information sources to create tourism products and services, such as dynamic packaging applications, travel planning engines, and price comparison tools.

In this chapter, we focus on the development and implementation of dynamic packaging applications, which allow consumers or booking agents to customize travel packages in real time. Our approach integrates the latest information technologies, including the Semantic Web, Web services, Web processes, and semantic packaging rules.

### Dynamic Packaging Applications
Currently, travelers often need to visit multiple independent websites to plan their trips, register personal information repeatedly, wait for responses, and make multiple payments. This process can be discouraging due to the lack of integrated functionalities. Dynamic packaging applications address these limitations by allowing consumers or travel agents to bundle trip components, such as flights, hotels, car rentals, and activities, into a single, seamless transaction.

#### The Dynamic Packaging Model
A dynamic packaging application allows users to specify preferences, such as a 5-day stay on Madeira Island. The application then dynamically queries various tourism information sources to find and combine suitable products, such as airfares, hotel rates, and car rentals. This creates a single, customized package that requires only one payment, simplifying the booking process.

#### Main Players: Expedia, Travelocity, and Orbitz
Expedia, Travelocity, and Orbitz are leading the development of dynamic packaging technology. Expedia, the largest online travel agency, follows a merchant model, negotiating wholesale rates with providers. Expedia's dynamic packaging capabilities allow consumers to book airline tickets, hotel rooms, and additional services like airport shuttles and prepaid meals. However, Expedia has been criticized for not fully disclosing taxes and fees, potentially leading to higher costs for consumers.

Travelocity, the second-largest online travel agency, offers a vast range of services and has implemented a new merchant model that provides a "single view" of room inventory. Travelocity's acquisition of Site59.com has enhanced its dynamic packaging capabilities, allowing users to book specific seats and rooms in real time. Travelocity includes all taxes and fees in its prices and ensures that only available flights and rooms are listed.

Orbitz, the third-largest online travel site, was founded by major airlines to compete with Expedia. Orbitz's dynamic packaging engine offers deep discounts on "Web fares" and provides customer care services that monitor travel conditions. Orbitz has also reduced distribution costs for its suppliers through the Orbitz Supplier Link technology program.

### Dynamic Packaging Application Architecture
Developing dynamic packaging applications is complex due to the need to integrate distributed and heterogeneous systems. A well-designed architecture is essential for success. We propose a six-layer architecture for dynamic packaging applications:

1. **Tourism Information Systems**: Stores the necessary information in systems like CRS, GDS, HDS, DMS, and websites.
2. **Tourism Data Sources**: Makes travel data available in various formats, such as HTML, XML, RDF, flat files, and relational models.
3. **Data Model Mapping**: Maps data from different sources to a common ontology to facilitate integration.
4. **Data Consolidation**: Consolidates segments of the common ontology using abstract business process models.
5. **Shared Global Data Model**: Provides a unified view of the consolidated data.
6. **Dynamic Packaging Engine**: Creates and manages dynamic packages based on the shared global data model.

This architecture aims to streamline the integration of diverse data sources and enable the creation of flexible, real-time travel packages.
