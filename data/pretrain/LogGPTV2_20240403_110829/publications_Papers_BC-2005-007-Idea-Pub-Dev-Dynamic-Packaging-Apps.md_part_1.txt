Developing Dynamic
Packaging Applications
using Semantic
Web-Based Integration
Jorge Cardoso, Universidade da Madeira, Portugal
Abstract
Dynamic packaging has been introduced as an innovative technology allowing for
the automated online configuration and assembling of packaged travel products for
individual customers. Dynamic packaging applications require a suitable integra-
tion of heterogeneous, autonomous, and distributed tourism information systems.
This integration is a complex and difficult issue. The Semantic Web, a relatively
new concept, brings a set of emerging technologies and models that need to be
explored and evaluated to assert its use for the implementation of more integrated
dynamic packaging applications. In this chapter, we analyze dynamic packaging
application requirements and present an architecture that enables the integration of
tourism data sources and creation of dynamic packages using semantic annotation,
semantic rules, ontologies, Web services, and Web processes. We will recognize that
the Semantic Web is a good candidate able to supply a solution for overcoming the
interoperability problems that (current) dynamic packaging applications face.

Introduction
Tourism has become one of the world’s largest industry players, and its growth
shows a consistent year-to-year increase. The World Tourism Organization (http://
www.world-tourism.org/) predicts that by 2020 tourist arrivals around the world
will increase over 200%. Tourism has become a highly competitive business for
tourism destinations all over the world. Competitive advantage is no longer natural,
but increasingly driven by science, information technology, and innovation.
The continuing growth in the use of the Internet has transformed the world into a
global village. For example, e-tourism-related Web sites provide a vast amount of
rich information, maps, pictures, sounds, and services on destinations throughout
the world. A study by Forrester (Forrester, 2005) estimates that business-to-business
(B2B) revenues will reach $8.8 trillion in 2005 and business-to-customer (B2C)
revenues in the U.S. will reach $229.9 billion by 2008.
The Internet is already the primary source of tourist destination information for
travelers. About 95% of Web users use the Internet to gather travel-related informa-
tion and about 93% indicate that they visited tourism Web sites when planning for
vacations (Lake, 2001). The number of people turning to the Internet for vacation and
travel planning has increased more than 300% over the past 5 years. It has outpaced
traditional sources of information on tourist destinations within a short period of
time. One major cause for the growth of e-tourism is that it extends existing business
models, reduces costs, and expands and introduces new distribution channels.
Evidence indicates that the effective use of information technology is crucial for
tourism businesses’ competitiveness and prosperity, as it influences their ability to
differentiate their offerings as well as their production and delivery costs. Tourism
is an information-based industry and one of the leading industries on the Internet.
For example, it is anticipated that most sectors in the travel industry throughout
the world will have Web sites on the Internet. Thus, it is vital for every tourism
destination and travel business to embrace the use of information technology and
exploit its potential.
Barnett and Standing (2001) argue that the rapidly changing business environment
brought on by the Internet requires organizations to quickly implement new business
models, develop new networks and alliances, and be creative in their marketing. In
order to compete in the electronic era, businesses must be prepared to use technol-
ogy-mediated channels, create internal and external value, formulate technology
convergent strategies, and organize resources around knowledge and relationships
(Rayport & Jaworski, 2001).
Tourism information systems (TIS) are a new type of business system that serve
and support e-tourism and e-travel, such as airlines, hoteliers, car rental companies,
leisure suppliers, and travel agencies. These systems rely on travel-related infor-

mation sources to create tourism products and services. The information present
on these sources can serve as the springboard for the development of a variety of
systems, including dynamic packaging applications, travel planning engines, and
price comparison applications.
In this chapter we are particularly interested in studying the development and
implementation of dynamic packaging applications. Dynamic packaging can be
defined as the combination of different travel products, bundled and priced in real
time, in response to the requests of the consumer or booking agent. In dynamic
packaging applications, consumer requirements shape the response of the packag-
ing system, the final price, and the products of travel packages. Our approach to the
development of dynamic packaging applications encompasses the use of the latest
information technologies such as the Semantic Web, Web services, Web processes,
and semantic packaging rules.
E-tourism is a perfect application area for Semantic Web technologies since in-
formation integration, dissemination, and exchange are the key backbones of the
travel industry. Therefore, the Semantic Web can considerably improve e-tourism
applications (DERI International, 2005). Dynamic packaging application solutions
deal with B2B integration and B2C transactions. While organizations have sought to
apply semantics to manage and exploit data or content to support integration, Web
processes are the means to exploit its application, increasingly made interoperable
with Web services.
Web services and Web processes are defined as loosely coupled, reusable components
that encapsulate functionality and are distributed and programmatically accessible
over standard Internet protocols. They constitute one of the “hot” areas of the Web
technology supporting the remote invocation of business functionality over the In-
ternet through message exchange. They provide an “information” layer that allows
integrating different data standards to exchange information seamlessly without
having to change the proprietary data schemas of tourism organizations.
Semantics can also be used to formally specify the packaging rules that influence
which products will be part of dynamic packages. The use of semantic packaging
rules has several benefits for dynamic packaging applications since travel managers
or travel agents, without programming experience, can manage and change packaging
rules to reflect market conditions; packaging policies can be easily communicated
and understood by all employees; and rules can be managed in isolation from the
application code.

Dynamic Packaging Applications
Currently, with most tourism information systems, travelers need to visit multiple
independent Web sites to plan their trip, register their personal information multiple
times, spend hours or days waiting for response or confirmation, and make multiple
payments by credit card. Consumers are discouraged by the lack of functionalities.
Dynamic packaging applications are emerging in response to these limitations and
have caught the attention of major worldwide online travel agencies.
The Dynamic Packaging Model
A dynamic packaging application allows consumers or travel agents to customize
trips by bundling trip components. Customers can specify a set of preferences for a
vacation, for example, a 5-day stay on Madeira Island, then the dynamic packaging
application dynamically accesses and queries a set of tourism information sources
to find products such as air fairs, hotel rates, car rental companies, and leisure
activity suppliers in real time. In the off-line world, such packages used to be put
together by tour operators in brochures. This new dynamic packaging technology
includes the ability to combine multiple travel components on demand, in creating
a reservation. The package that is created is handled seamlessly as one transaction
and requires only one payment from the consumer, hiding the pricing of individual
components.
Main Players: Expedia, Travelocity, and Orbitz
The travel industry’s three most dominant online agencies—Expedia, Traveloc-
ity, and Orbitz—are leading the development of dynamic packaging technology,
and they continue to put significant investment into providing an efficient and
sophisticated booking experience. Travelers are given the opportunity to construct
customized packages by choosing the airline carrier, their flight, the hotel location,
the car rental company, their insurance, other travel products such as theme park
passes, and even tours.
Expedia is the largest online travel agency. Expedia follows the merchant model,
that is, it consigns hotel rooms at a wholesale rate and resells them to consumers. The
key in the merchant model is to negotiate satisfactory agreements with providers.
Expedia has stated that the popular durations requested by consumers are not the
traditional 7/14 night model, but holidays of 3, 5, and 8 nights, a level of flexibility
that is outside the costing model of most charter-based, mass-market tour opera-
tors. This is one of the strategies having lead to its top market position. From the

customers’ view point, the Expedia business model has two major drawbacks. When
Expedia sells all of its allocated hotel rooms, it informs customers that no rooms
are available for sale. This is misleading because there might be rooms available
outside of Expedia’s allocated share. Moreover, Expedia does not fully disclose the
taxes and fees that will be added to the sale price. In some cases additional tax and
service fees mean that consumers might actually pay more than if they had booked
the room directly from the hotel.
Expedia’s use of dynamic packaging is one of the best among the competition: Using
Expedia’s Web site, consumers can book airline tickets and hotel rooms, and also
book a shuttle to pick them up at the airport and set up prepaid restaurant meals.
In this way Expedia focuses on the total journey of consumers. Expedia pioneered
dynamic packaging in 2002 and now gets almost 30% of revenue from package
buyers (Mullaney, 2004).
Travelocity provides Internet and wireless reservation information for more than 700
airlines, more than 55,000 hotels, and more than 50 car rental companies (PRNews-
wire, 2002). In addition, Travelocity offers more than 6,500 vacation packages, tour
and cruise departures, and a vast database of destination and interest information. It
is now the second largest online travel agency. Travelocity launched a new merchant
model hotel program offering advantages so compelling that more than 2,000 hotels
signed agreements to participate. Travelocity can pull rates and availability directly
from the hotel’s central reservation system (CRS). This eliminates the time and
costs associated with manually allocating blocks of rooms to a separate system for
discounted sales. Travelocity can provide a “single view” of room inventory. This
is an advantage compared to the merchant model of competitors. Also, Traveloc-
ity pays the hotels immediately upon checkout, eliminating the waiting period for
payment that hotels experience with other merchant model distributors.
Travelocity made a strategic acquisition of Site59.com, whose dynamic packaging
technology allows Travelocity to respond to the growing popularity of Expedia’s
dynamic packages. Travelocity dynamic vacation technology will be the first to
allow users to book specific airline seats and hotel rooms themselves, in real time.
Travelocity has included taxes and fees in its products and strives to only list flights
and rooms still available.
Since launching its Web site to the general public in June 2001, Orbitz has be-
come the third largest online travel site in the world. It was founded by five major
airlines, American, Continental, Delta, Northwest, and United. The main objective
was to compete with Expedia and online ticketing sales, hoping to take advantage
of increase in ticket sales online. The launch of Orbitz, a $100 million joint ven-
ture (Hospitality, 2005), demonstrates the high cost of entry into the travel space.
It is a costly undertaking that requires cooperation with existing industry players.
Therefore, new entrants face enormous challenges.

Orbitz had a perceived advantage over Travelocity and Expedia because it had a
deeper inventory of “Web fares,” the heavily discounted tickets promoted on the
carriers’ own Internet sites (CBS NEWS, 2003). This advantage has drawn wide-
ranging criticism from Expedia and Travelocity with the claim that the airline-backed
ticketing operation is antithetical to competition in the industry and hurts consumers.
Orbitz has lowered distribution costs for its suppliers by sharing a portion of the fees
that global distribution systems (GDSs) pay to Orbitz as an incentive for booking
travel on their systems. Orbitz further reduced distribution costs for several airlines
through their participation in the Orbitz Supplier Link technology program, which
allows Orbitz to sell some tickets without using a GDS.
Orbitz’s Web site has already completed the implementation of its dynamic pack-
aging engine. One major characteristic of Orbitz strategy is that the customer re-
lationship does not end when a customer buys a travel product. Orbitz is the only
travel site with a customer care team that monitors nationwide travel conditions
for travelers. The care team gathers and interprets Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA), National Weather Service, and other data providing the latest information
on flight delays, weather conditions, gate changes, airport congestion, or any other
event that might impact travel via mobile phone, pager, personal digital assistant
(PDA), or e-mail.
Dynamic Packaging
Application Architecture
The development of dynamic packaging applications is a complex issue since it
requires the integration of distributed systems with infrastructures that are not fre-
quently encountered in more traditional centralized systems. For dynamic packaging
applications to be successful it is indispensable to studying their architecture. The
study of architectural strategies has a critical impact on early decisions in system
development; it is both cost effective and efficient to conduct analyses at the architec-
ture level, before substantial resources have been committed to development (Bass,
Clements, & Kazman, 1998). Therefore, we will undertake a study of our approach
to dynamic packaging application development by presenting its architecture.
We propose an architecture for dynamic packaging applications composed of six
layers: (1) tourism information systems, (2) tourism data sources, (3) data model
mapping, (4) data consolidation, (5) shared global data model, and (6) dynamic pack-
aging engine. The relationships between these layers are illustrated in Figure 1.
To better understand the purpose of each architectural layer, we will briefly describe
them in this section and give a detailed presentation in the following sections.

• Tourism information systems. The information needed to build dynamic
packages is stored in tourism information systems, such as CRS, GDS, HDS,
DMS, and Web sites.
• Tourism data sources. Each tourism information system makes travel data
available through data sources in one or more formats, such as HTML, XML,
RDF, flat files, relational model, and so forth.
• Data model mapping. In our architecture, data on data sources is mapped to
the concepts of a common ontology to facilitate the integration of informa-
tion.
• Data consolidation. The various segments of the common ontology constructed
from individual data sources are consolidated using procedures described using
an abstract business process model.
