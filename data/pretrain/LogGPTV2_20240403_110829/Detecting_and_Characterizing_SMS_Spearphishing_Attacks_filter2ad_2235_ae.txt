the loan had expired and tricking them to contact with the attack-
ers, or they would be prosecuted for the debt. We speculate these
victims may have indeed used the loan services in the first round of
the scam, and they may have continued to be trapped in the second
round for the fear of prosecution. We term this phenomenon as
progressive deception, in which the attackers do not simply commit
the spearphishing multiple times, but craft a chain of scams to per-
petuate the attack in a long-term and systematic manner. Although
it is more costly than one-time scams, i.e., the strategy requires
continuous tracking the individual status of victims (over 40% of
the victims were tracked for more than 10 days, with the longest
being 85 days from our data), this carefully constructed scam is also
more deceptive to the victims and would be taken by the attackers
for the potentially high profits.
Strategy of spearphishing: multi-semantic evasion. During
manual inspections of Financial Scam messages, we find several
“hidden false positives”, one example of which is shown in Figure 9.
In fact, it was used to advertise gambling, with the coded domain
pointing to a Gambling Phishing website. However, as the gambling-
related text only appears as a comment of a bank transfer, it was
able to be hidden in the semantics of normal financial services and
is indeed identified “incorrectly” by our multi-classifier as Financial
Scam (rather than a Gamling Phishing). We consider it to be a new
scam strategy, which we termed as multi-semantic evasion, where
the attacker embeds text with suspicious semantics into a relatively
normal SMS to hide its true purpose.
We also tried to detect this behavior across the entire dataset. In
order to find messages with multiple semantics, we split a message
at the middle into two parts, and then identify their semantic cat-
egories separately. One message could be marked as suspicious if
the categories of its two parts did not match, and then a manual
check would be processed to ensure the mix of semantics is for
evasion. In the end, we identified 1,197 spear spam messages of
multi-semantic evasion from 416 campaigns, covering 839 victims,
and 706 of them have successfully hidden their true purposes in
the content identification of our multi-classifier.
Strategy of Spearphishing: global affair integration. It is worth
noting that, a highly influential public event, the COVID-19 virus,
emerged just during our data collection period (Dec. 2019 to Mar.
2020). As public reports have identified cyber-crimes associated
with COVID-19 [63], in the field of spearphishing SMS, we also
discovered 276 COVID-19 related cases. Attackers exploited global
concerns and fears about the virus to lure users. For example, they
threaten victims that their invested funds would be withheld due to
the effects of the virus and provide a cellphone for victims to contact
further. In another case, attackers used the masks, a scarce medical
item at that time, as bait to entice users to sign up for gambling
websites (as the example of Gambling Phishing in Table 4).

the flight has been canceled or delayed, and leave one private cell-
phone in the message for subsequent scams. In this study, we find
several major Chinese airlines, including China Eastern Airlines,
Shanghai Airlines and Air China, have been affected. License Plates
(571 messages) are commonly used to impersonate car insurance
companies, asking victims to check their insurance status via em-
bedded URLs that actually pointed to gambling phishing websites
or distributed malicious APKs. Besides, IDs (17 messages) are also
exploited for financial fraud.
5.4 Real-world Impact of SMS Spearphishing
In this section, we evaluate the impact of spearphishing SMS attacks
from the following three perspectives.
Victim Coverage. The detected spearphishing spam messages
were related with 24,472 IMSI (unique identifier of SIM Card) and
24,346 IMEI (unique identifier of Mobile Equipment) (both have
been anonymized by hashes). In other words, around 24k victims
were endangered by spearphishing spam SMS from Dec. 2019 to
Mar. 2020, covering all the provinces in China.
“Looks Safe” Rate. As mentioned in Section 3, users could recover
the detected messages to Normal Inbox, when those messages are
actually useful to them. Our industrial partner provided tags for
these messages that have been recovered as “looks safe”. We found
the “looks safe” rate of spearphishing is 0.04%, which is four times
over common spam ones (0.01%). It indicates that the messages
embedded with the user’s personal information can attract more at-
tention, which also means the success rate of spearphishing attacks
is higher than common spam to trap users.
Follow-up Domain Visits. As shown in Table 2, more than 60%
detected messages embed URL/Domain. The visits of these domains
during the data collection period could help to value the actual im-
pact of spearphishing attacks. Here we utilize the Passive DNS
database of 360 Netlab[5], which has better coverage in China than
other PDNS data sources as DNSDB[18]. From the 1,473 domains
in spearphishing SMS we detected, 80% of them received more than
100 queries and 11% had been visited more than 5,000 times during
the data collection period. Factoring the impact of spearphishing,
we found 87.62% of requests occurred after the spearphishing mes-
sages were sent. Moreover, 1,392 (94.50%) domains are marked as
malicious by at least one threat intelligence [1, 57], of which 105
are phishing-related. In particular, one phishing domain appeared
in 432 messages embedding victims’ License Plate Numbers. In this
case, the attackers disguised as vehicle authorities to lure victims
into clicking on the phishing domain, which actually redirected to a
gambling scam website. PDNS logs revealed that, this scam website
received 5,136 requests after spearphishing messages were sent,
with an increase of 37.2% in average daily requests. More seriously,
we find that 28 domains are malware-related, and the spearphishing
messages increased their daily request volume by an average of
27.03%. Despite the inherent limitations of PDNS data, we believe
the above findings are sufficient to confirm spearphishing SMS
attacks have made a considerable impact in practice.
To sum up, we observed 24k victims of spearphishing SMS at-
tacks in 3 months, covering every province inside China. Spearphish-
ing messages are more likely to be recognized as “normal messages”
from the user’s perspective. Therefore, we suggest that spearphish-
ing attacks in SMS do cause serious harm in the real world.
5.5 Personal Info in Spearphishing SMS
In this section, we discuss the leaked personal information lever-
aged in spearphishing SMS, including how attackers use them to
build customized scam content and the possible sources of leakage.
Through manual inspections, we find Names are usually placed
at the beginning of the SMS with a salutation or greeting to attract
the victims’ attention. While after getting the Flight Info (883 mes-
sages), attackers would pose as staff members of airlines, claiming
How exactly the victims’ information gets leaked is a matter of
great concern. In the field of telecom scams, previous work [6] has
identified social networks, malware, and public forums as possible
sources of information leakage. In this work, it is difficult to track
and precisely locate the source of detected PIIs on a large scale
(especially when researchers do not have direct access to the actual
content of leaked information). However, we did find some possible
sources through manual case studies.
First, we find 10,620 Employment messages, of which 9,027 were
impersonation popular online job websites in China [56]. In these
messages, attackers falsely claimed that the victim’s job request
was approved and lured the victim into further scams through
follow-up contacts. A 2019 report announced that third parties may
collect PIIs [23] by capturing resumes uploaded by job seekers on
such websites. We also perform manual checks on the recruitment
website, and find that it was indeed possible to access the personal
information of job applicants through their CVs.
Second, we find 274 Insurance Scam messages impersonating
China Post, where the attackers claim that a certain insurance prod-
uct purchased by victims has expired and lure the victims to renew
the policy by clicking on one embedded link that actually redirects
to a Gambling Phishing website. Interestingly, the victims of this
case were concentrated in the provinces of Guangdong (41.97%)
and Guangxi (30.66%), and the spoofed product was also served
for users in that regions. Therefore, we speculate that the personal
information of victims in this incident may have originated from
internal leaks within several local organizations.
Limitation of Verification. As described in Section 3.2, all de-
tected personal information of victims has been hashed, with only
the type and corresponding hash value given to researchers. It max-
imizes the protection of the user privacy, while also makes it hard
to perform corresponding validations of PIIs. In other words, we are
unable to validate whether the name embedded in spearphishing
messages matches with the real name of the victim, not to mention
further tracing the leakage source of PIIs. It is considered as one
major limitation of evaluation in this work. However, even in the
relatively mature research area of spearphishing emails, few exist-
ing works could validate whether the information in fraudulent
email content exactly matches the actual personal information of
the victim [25, 26, 55]. Besides, the authentication of Name could
only affect the success rate of attacks, without changing the fact that
the messages we detected are customized, fraudulent, and sent to
specific victims, i.e., compliant with the definition of spearphishing.
Moreover, we focus on detecting the occurrence of spearphishing
SMS attacks and understanding the behind strategies, rather than
studying their effectiveness (success rate). The validation of the
accuracy of victim’s PIIs could be explored in the future through
the proactive deployment of honeypots as previous work [6].

6 DISCUSSION
Comparison with Spearphishing via other channels. As one
of the social engineering attacks where the attackers pretend as
trusted senders and send customized phishing content, spearphish-
ing via SMS has unique characteristics compared with other chan-
nels. First, cellphones are more commonly used than emails and
social software, increasing the risk of relevant information being
leaked to attackers. Second, while SMS is not richly formatted, lim-
iting the extent to which attackers could customize the phishing
content, it also raises difficulties to detection. Previous detection of
spearphishing on other channels based on rich field information,
such as headers and forward relationships, could not be directly
applied to SMS. Thus, we proposed a novel detecting system in this
work. Our results corroborate similarities between spearphishing
SMS and attacks via other channels, e.g., both require persistent
interaction with potential victims [25], and also discover unique
features of spearphishing SMS such as “test-sending” and “multi-
semantic” strategies.
Comparison with SMS Spam. Previous works on spam have ex-
plored this ecosystem primarily in terms of different distribution
channels, such as spam from SMS Gateways [48, 49] and spam from
Fake Base Stations [73]. However, even if from the same channel, the
practical security risks of different SMS content are quite varied. For
example, while ordinary promotional SMS can be at best “annoying”
users, phishing messages, especially the high-risk spearphishing
messages, would expose users to serious information leakage or
property damage. This work investigates the spearphishing attack,
which probably is the most “high-risk” part of the entire spam SMS
ecosystem. We believe our findings would provide assistance in
addressing the core issues in the field of SMS spamming.
Recommendation. Bootstrapping from our measurement find-
ings, we provide several recommendations to mitigate this secu-
rity threat. First, our proposed spearphishing detection system
would enable mobile security applications to improve their detec-
tion capabilities. They could also provide eye-catching risk alerts of
spearphishing SMS by revising the UI design of notification. Second,
as SMS gateways are being abused as the major channel for send-
ing spear messages, ISPs could consider cooperating with security
vendors to enhance the audits of content submitted to their SMS
platforms. Furthermore, the evasion strategies of spearphishing ob-
served in this study can provide new insights for ISPs for detection,
such as monitoring and identifying test-sending patterns and block-
ing large-scale spear attacks at the initial phase. Besides, although
we only analyzed data collected within China, our methods, such as
the use of sentence structure to detect spear spam, are also worth
replicating in spear detection in other regions.
7 RELATED WORK
Spearphishing Attack. Previous works mainly focused on the de-
tection of spearphishing attacks, especially for spearphishing emails.
Attackers usually utilize account spoofing for spearphishing, which
could be classified into external attacks, where the attackers need
to imitate some well-known accounts (or one known to the victim)
to imbue their profile with a sense of trust or authority [26], and
internal attacks, where attackers are more insidious as they send
malicious content to victims by getting control of compromised
accounts [25, 55]. Proposed detection methods of spearphishing
emails rely on features of embedded URLs [9, 20], content of web-
pages [64, 65, 72], and linguistic features of the email headers and
body content [2, 11, 17, 26, 35, 69]. In recent years, telecommunica-
tions have also been abused as the main channels for scams [38],
with the emerging attacking techniques like caller ID spoofing [59].
Our work gives the first large-scale detection and characterization
of spearphishing attacks via SMS channel.
Spam SMS. Previous works have explored spam SMS sent through
a variety of channels, including fake base stations [33, 47, 73] or
SMS Gateways [48, 49]. Existing approaches for detecting spam
SMS are mainly included template-based clustering [4, 13, 22], topic
analysis [36] and clustering based on the sending behaviors of sus-
picious accounts [32]. However, there are no works that discussed
the emerging new threat, SMS spearphishing attack, which utilizes
victims’ personal information to construct deceptive content.
8 CONCLUSION
In this work, we first explored a new threat, SMS spearphishing
attack, through the three-month real-world dataset (31.96 million)
in China. We designed and implemented a novel detection system
based on the three key observations obtained from an empirical
study, and detected a total of 90,801 SMS spearphishing messages
on the whole dataset with 96.16% precision. Measurement of those
detected messages revealed multi-faceted characteristics of SMS
spearphishing attacks, like business categories, temporal character-
istics and spatial characteristics, and the infrastructures of attackers.
Besides, by grouping the messages into 11,475 campaigns, we firstly
found several interesting strategies of attackers and provided a
comparative analysis with other types of spam. Our findings would
assist the security community in understanding and mitigating SMS
spearphishing attacks.
