I am encountering an intermittent 500 error with every second POST request, regardless of whether it is a jQuery POST or form submission, using both Chrome and Firefox. The issue seems to be specific to the production environment, as I do not experience this problem on my local SDK server. Additionally, the 500 errors are not appearing in the logs. I have tested this with more than five different post handlers, and the errors persist only in the production environment. It is worth noting that the requests are successful when made from a Python script using the `requests` module.

**Steps Taken:**
- Tested with multiple post handlers.
- Confirmed the issue occurs only in the production environment, not on the local SDK server.
- Verified that the requests work correctly when sent from a Python script using the `requests` module.
- Checked for any relevant error messages in the logs (none found).

**Questions and Suggestions:**
1. Are GET requests functioning correctly?
2. Are you certain that the POST requests are being sent to an endpoint that is properly handled by your application?
3. Have you checked for typos in your JavaScript and application route definitions?
4. Is there a catch-all request handler (e.g., `/*`) that might be receiving the request and failing to respond?

To better diagnose the issue, please provide the following:
- The contents of your `app.yaml` file.
- Your server-side URL routes.
- A snippet of the JavaScript code making the POST requests.

This information will help in identifying the root cause of the problem.
