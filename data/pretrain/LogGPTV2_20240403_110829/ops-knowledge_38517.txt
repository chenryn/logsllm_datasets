User: Based on the Python programming language, how to realize automatic management tasks in network operation and maintenance? Please provide sample codes based on actual needs.
Assistant: Automatic management tasks in network operation and maintenance can be implemented through Python programming, such as automatic backup configuration, automatic inspection equipment, automatic software update, etc. The following takes automatic backup configuration as an example and provides sample code: 1. First, you need to install the paramiko library (pip install paramiko) 2. Write the code: import paramiko # Input the device IP address, user name and password ip = input("Please enter the device IP address :") username = input("Please enter your username:") password = input("Please enter your password:") # Create SSH client ssh = paramiko.SSHClient() # Automatically add to known_hosts ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy ()) # connect device ssh.connect(ip, port=22, username=username, password=password) # send command stdin, stdout, stderr = ssh.exec_command("show run") # read command output config = stdout .read().decode() # Save the configuration file filename = f"{ip}.config" with open(filename, "w") as f: f.write(config) # Close the connection ssh.close() print( f"Save the configuration file to {filename}!") The above code realizes the acquisition of the configuration file from the network device, and saves it locally with the IP address of the device. The script can be executed regularly by means of scheduled tasks to realize the function of automatically backing up network device configuration files.
