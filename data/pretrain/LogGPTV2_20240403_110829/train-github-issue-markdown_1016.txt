### Summary
It appears that the SSH connection sharing feature is not functioning correctly. I have a single server defined in the inventory twice, with the same hostname but different aliases.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Use any playbook.
2. Define an inventory file with the following content:
   ```ini
   server.io-8721 ansible_host=server.io
   server.io-d4f2 ansible_host=server.io
   ```

### Expected Results
The `setup` task should succeed for both hosts.

### Actual Results
When running the `setup` task, I encounter the following errors:

```plaintext
TASK [setup] *******************************************************************
fatal: [server.io-8721]: UNREACHABLE! => {"changed": false, "msg": "Failed to connect to the host via ssh: Shared connection to server.io closed.\r\n", "unreachable": true}
msg: Failed to connect to the host via ssh: Shared connection to server.io closed.
fatal: [server.io-d4f2]: UNREACHABLE! => {"changed": false, "msg": "Failed to connect to the host via ssh: Shared connection to server.io closed.\r\n", "unreachable": true}
msg: Failed to connect to the host via ssh: Shared connection to server.io closed.
```

Both hosts are marked as unreachable due to a shared connection issue.
