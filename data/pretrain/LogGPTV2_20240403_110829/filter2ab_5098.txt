**Title: Black Hat USA 2022 - 8th Annual NOC Report**

The Black Hat Network Operations Center (NOC) team is back with another year of fascinating and sometimes bewildering statistics. In this 8th annual report, we will share the data that consistently keeps us both intrigued and entertained. 

We will provide an in-depth look at the tools and techniques we employ to set up, stabilize, and secure the network. Additionally, we will highlight the changes and improvements we have implemented over the past year to enhance our operations.

As always, we will also share some of the more humorous and unusual network activities, offering insights into how security professionals behave on an open WiFi network. These anecdotes not only add a touch of humor but also serve as valuable learning experiences for all attendees.
