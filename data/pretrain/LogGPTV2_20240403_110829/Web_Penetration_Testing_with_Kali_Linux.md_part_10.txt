(such as a NAT address). This really comes into play when you are attacking
people outside your network or on the Internet. Select yes if you are attacking
victims outside your network. Type no if you are attacking victims on the
same network, such as an internal lab.

Client-side Attacks
• IP address/hostname for reverse connection: When SET delivers its payload
to the victim, SET needs to tell the victim how to connect back to Kali. In a
lab environment, you can type in the IP address of your Kali server.
• URL you want to clone: This is the website you are copying.
• Exploit to deliver: SET will use the Metasploit framework to deliver the
exploit. The most popular option is the Windows Reverse_TCP Meterpreter.
The Windows Reverse_TCP Meterpreter works by having a victim run an
executable that establishes an open port for an attacker to connect back
through to gain full shell access to the victim's PC. The following screenshot
shows the payloads available. The Windows Reverse_TCP Meterpreter is the
second option listed.
You can import your own executable. This is generally used by
attackers or other people writing their own tools/malware.
SET will ask to select what type of anti-virus obfuscation technique you would like
to use. SET will display a rating next to each technique. Select a highly -rated option,
unless you desire a specific option. The following screenshot shows the available
options. We will go with option 16, because it has the best ranking.

SET will ask which listener port should be used. In most cases, stick with the default
ports. After the last question is answered, SET will bring up the cloned website.
The new cloned website can be used as a means to compromise targets. You need
to trick users into accessing the cloned website using an Internet browser. The user
accessing the cloned website will get a Java pop-up, which if run, will provide a
Reserve_TCP Meterpreter to your Kali server. The attacker can start a meterpreter
session and have full admin privileges on the device accessing the cloned website.

Client-side Attacks
The client machine will see a simple Java pop-up message that looks normal and
should go unnoticed by the average user as shown in the following screenshot:
The moment the end user runs the Java applet from the cloned website, the Kali
server will connect to the victim's machine as shown in the following screenshot:
The next example is a screenshot showing that SET can interact with the meterpreter
session and issue commands directly to our victim:
[ 138 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 4
You can have multiple sessions with the meterpreter. In this example, we used the
command sessions –I 1. Essentially, what we are doing is interacting with the first
session of the meterpreter. If we had multiple hosts compromised, we could have
multiple meterpreter sessions, interact with them, switch between them, or close
them individually.
Now that we have learned some of the basics of using SET, let's look at one more
example. We are going to look at cloning a website for the purposes of stealing
a password.
This time when we get to the attack options, we will select credential harvester attack.
The credential harvester attack can be found by first selecting Social Engineering
Attacks, Website Attack Vectors, and then Credential Harvester Attacks.

Client-side Attacks
You have the option of cloning a website, using a website template, or importing
your own web files (HTML, images, and other files).
Popular sites such as Facebook, Gmail, and Twitter have templates. Entering
the URL of the site can clone other sites. We find in some instances both website
templates and cloning a site just doesn't look right. In those cases, you should use
a custom import. You can use web copier or web cloning software, which we have
already discussed, to save a copy of a website on your Kali box. Once saved, use
the custom import option to point to the copied website directory. You will need
to experiment to see what option works best for your particular site.
We will choose option 2) Site Cloner. We will be asked to enter a URL. We will
clone https://www.facebook.com.
Note that we are entering the exact URL and specifying if we want the
HTTPS or HTTP URL. In most cases, this will not make any difference
because we won't host a secure website, but in some cases the HTTP
site may be different than the HTTPS site.
We will also be asked to enter the IP address which SET will use to host the fake
website. Most likely this will be the IP address of your Kali Linux box. However, if
you are planning on directing victims to an address that's using a NAT translation
(perhaps through an upstream firewall), then enter the NAT address.
SET will start waiting for connections once you have cloned a website and
configured the listening port, as shown in the following screenshot:
[ 140 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 4
The next step is to direct users to the fake site. One common way to achieve this is
sending out a fake e-mail also known as a phishing e-mail. SET can automate this for
you, but for this example, we decided to do so manually. The next example shows a
fake e-mail using our cloned Facebook link. When the user clicks on the link www.
facebook.com, they will be sent to our fake site at facebook.secmob.net.
[ 141 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Client-side Attacks
You can see in the following screenshot our cloned page looks like Facebook, but
the URL is not really Facebook. The attack assumes the victim will not notice the
slightly different URL, which is why real phishing attacks use similar domains to
the real website.
When the victim enters his or her name on the fake site, SET will redirect the user
to real site. In most cases, users will enter their password a second time on the real
site and be logged onto the site, never realizing they have been attacked. On the Kali
Linux system running SET, you can see that the password is captured.
[ 142 ]

Chapter 4
In addition to the live log, SET will generate a report of the incident so that the
attacker can leverage the stolen credentials at a later time.
When using tools such as SET to attack clients, it is important for a Penetration Tester
to understand the behavior of the clients. One of the most efficient ways to do this is
using a proxy server to examine and intercept web requests.
In Chapter 6, Web Attacks, we will look at Proxies in much greater detail; however, it
is still important to learn how to examine how the client is behaving when using web
attacks such as using SET as described preceding paragraph.
MitM Proxy
MITM Proxy is a great tool for a Penetration Tester to examine the client's
vulnerabilities. It allows the administrator to examine the HTTPS connection, halt,
examine, and reply traffic. MITM Proxy allows an administrator to alter the request
or response from a web server.
MITM Proxy can allow a Penetration Tester to examine the attacks quickly and
see what requests and responses are coming from the web browser. MITM Proxy
can be launched by going to Kali | Sniffing/Spoofing | Web Sniffers and
selecting mitmproxy.
[ 143 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Client-side Attacks
Its recommended to use MITM Proxy when setting up a SET attack, as
well as when analyzing the behavior of that attack. You should run SET
and MITM Proxy at the same time in a test environment.
Once MitM proxy is loaded, you will need to point your client's web browser to the
your Kali server. MITM will display the web requests transactions that occur on the
client-side as shown in the following screenshot:
There will be a log of all browser activity going through the client. Although MITM
Proxy is not used as an active component in a typical web Penetration Test, it is a
great tool to use when setting up and testing SET before using the package in a live
environment. In later chapters, we will examine other types of proxies; however, the
reason we like MitM Proxy is because it is an easy way as Penetration Tester you can
test attack tools by having them connected directly on your Kali Linux box.
Host scanning
A common method to accessing host systems is by identifying and exploiting
vulnerabilities in the operating system, installed applications, and other programs.
Tools such as Nessus are automated methods to evaluate systems for known
vulnerabilities. This section will cover how to install and run Nessus against a target
system. Exploitation tools covered in Chapter 3, Server-side Attacks, can be used to
take advantage of vulnerabilities identified by Nessus.
[ 144 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 4
Host scanning with Nessus
Nessus does not come pre-installed with Kali. You will need to obtain a registration
code from Tenable to use Nessus. Tenable gives a home feed option, but is limited
to scanning 16 IP addresses. If you would like to scan more IPs, you must purchase a
professional feed from Tenable.
Installing Nessus on Kali
Nessus HomeFeed is available for non-commercial, personal use only. If you will
use Nessus at your place of business, you must purchase Nessus ProfessionalFeed.
To get an activation code for Nessus go to http://www.tenable.com/products/
nessus/nessus-homefeed.
Nessus does not come preloaded with Kali and will need to be installed. You will
need to download and install Nessus. There is not a version specific to Kali Linux,
but the Debian 6.0 version works well.
1. Download Nessus for Debian. Go to the site http://www.tenable.com/
products/nessus/select-your-operating-system to download Nessus
for Debian 64-bit.
Note that when you download Nessus, you can copy it to the /tmp
directory. If you input these commands from another directory, you
will need to adjust the commands.
2. Go to the directory where you downloaded Nessus and issue the
following commands:
ar vx Nessus-5.2.1-debian6*
tar -xzvf data.tar.gz
tar -xzvf control.tar.gz
ar vx Nessus-5.2.1-debian6*,
tar -xzvf data.tar.gz
tar -xzvf control.tar.gz
There will now be an etc directory and an opt directory.
[ 145 ]

Client-side Attacks
3. Copy the nessus directory in /tmp/opt/ to the /opt directory; make the /
opt directory if it doesn't exist. Issue the following commands:
mkdir /opt (You may get an error stating the /opt directory exists
however, move to the next command).
cp -Rf //opt/nessus /opt
cp -Rf //etc/init.d/nessus* /etc/init.d
4. You can delete the contents of the Nessus download from the /tmp directory.
5. To start Nessus, issue the following command:
/etc/init.d/nessusd start
6. Log onto the Nessus management interface. Open a browser and navigate
to https://127.0.0.1:8834.
Using Nessus
The first time you log into Nessus, you will be greeted with a few welcome messages,
and a SSL warning will pop up letting you know you are connecting to a self-signed
certificate. After some initial self-explanatory screens, you will be prompted to enter
your activation code and download the latest plugins.
[ 146 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 4
You will also set a username and password that will be used to manage the Nessus
application. The following screenshots show setting up an account and providing the
activation code e-mailed by Tenable after registering:
[ 147 ]

Client-side Attacks
Initial download of the plugins can take some time, so be patient.
Once all the updates have been downloaded and initialized, you will be presented
with the login screen. Use the username and password you set up during the
initial installation.
To start a scan, click on the Scan tab on the top ribbon and select New Scan. You will
be then prompted to enter details of the target. You will also be asked to select what
template you would like to use. Nessus has a few built-in templates. In this example,
we are choosing external network scan.
[ 148 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 4
If the Scan tab isn't available, you can also select Scan Templates
and New Scan to create a new scan.
After you select Create Scan, the scan will launch at the scheduled time. The default
schedule will run instantly, so in most cases, the scan will start to immediately run.
After the scan is completed, the results can be viewed by clicking on the Results tab.
This will provide the administrator a report of what Nessus found.
[ 149 ]

Client-side Attacks
We can examine the completed scans as well as any results collected so far in any
active scans as shown in the following screenshot:
As a Penetration Tester, you want to pay attention to any vulnerabilities.
Vulnerabilities identified by their Microsoft patch or vulnerability reference
number can be searched in the Metasploit framework to use an exploit on a
target host. Refer to Chapter 3, Server-side Attacks, on how to use Metasploit for
more information.
The preceding example shows some extremely dangerous vulnerabilities (don't
worry, we went back and patched the systems). All of these vulnerabilities can be
used to exploit a system using Metasploit or other attack tools. For more on exploiting
vulnerabilities found by Nessus, see Metasploit in Chapter 3, Server-side Attacks.

Nessus offers options for exporting details about vulnerabilities identified. You can
export findings as HTML, CSV, PDF, and many other common file types. To export
findings, go to the Results section and select a completed scan. The third tab on the
left provides options for exporting scans, as shown in the following two screenshots:

Obtaining and cracking user passwords
Password cracking by definition is recovering passwords from data that has been
stored or transmitted by a computer system. Passwords are used to secure various
system types, which we have touched upon in Chapter 3, Server-side Attacks, while
attacking web servers.
Host systems are usually Windows or Linux-based and have specific characteristics
regarding how they store and protect user passwords. This section will focus
on cracking host system password files. We included this in the Web Application
Penetration Testing book, because host systems are a common authorized client to
web applications. Compromising a client means opening a door to access a targeted
web application.
The easiest method to obtain user passwords is through social engineering. As
previously described, a hacker could obtain passwords or clues to how passwords
are created by posing as an authorized subject. For example, identifying that all
passwords must be between 6-10 characters, start with a capital letter, and end with
a number dramatically reduces the number of possible outcomes a hacker would
need to attempt to crack a password. (Kali offers a tool called Crunch that makes
generating a password list for this type of attack extremely easy).
[ 151 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Client-side Attacks
A savvy Penetration Tester should use Reconnaissance techniques presented in Chapter
2, Reconnaissance, to identify system types, possible password policies, people involved
with administering systems, and other information that would help narrow down the
possibilities required to crack a password.
There are a few ways hackers crack passwords. These are listed as follows:
• Guess: Manually guess using information obtained about a target
• Dictionary attack: Use an automated attack that tries all the possible
dictionary words
• Brute-force: Try all the possible character combinations
• Hybrid: Combining dictionary with brute-force
Passwords must be stored so that the systems can verify a user's identity and access
rights. Systems do not store passwords in plain text files for obvious security reasons.
Most systems do not use encryption as the only means to protect passwords, because a
key is required to unencrypt, which poses a weakness to protecting the encrypted files.
Hashing was invented as a means to transform a key or password, usually arithmetic,
into a completely different value. Hashing is non-reversible and outputs the same
value for an entered key, which means a hash can be stored and verified against an
entered password to verify authenticity. Changing one factor, such as making a letter
capital or adding a space, generates a completely different hash output.
Hashes can be brute-forced like a password if you know the formula for generating
a Hash. Many password cracking tools such as John the Ripper are capable of
detecting a hash and brute-force attacking all hash output combinations with
auto-generated hash outputs. Once a match is found, John the Ripper will print
out the plain text password used to generate the matching hash.
Rainbow tables are the worst adversary to common Hash algorithms. Rainbow
tables are a pre-computed database of all the hash outputs that could be searched
to identify a hash output. Websites such as www.freerainbowtables.com offer
versions for popular hash algorithms such as MD5 found in most Windows systems.
Kali also offers applications such as RainbowCrack used to generate Rainbow tables.
Salting a hash was created as a means to combat Rainbow tables by adding
additional custom bits to change the output of a hash to something not found
in common Rainbow tables. Unfortunately, many systems such as Windows do
not use salted hashing.

Chapter 4
Windows passwords
Windows is the most common operating system used by businesses worldwide.
Microsoft has had a rocky road regarding protecting passwords. The current
Microsoft products are much more secure than older versions; however, they are
still vulnerable to attacks by many tools offered in Kali.
Windows stores passwords in the SAM (System Account Management) registry
file. The exception to this is when Active Directory is used. An Active Directory is
a separate authentication system that stores passwords in a LDAP database. The SAM
file is located at C:\\sys32\config.
The SAM file stores passwords in a hashed format using the LM and NTLM hash
to add security to the protected file. The SAM file cannot be moved or copied while
Windows is running. The SAM file can be dumped, displaying the password hashes
that can be moved offline for a brute-force tool to crack. A hacker can also get the
SAM file by booting a different OS, mounting C:\, booting a Linux distribution on
a disk (such as Kali), or booting off of a CD/floppy drive.
One common place to find a SAM file is in the C:\\repair folder.
The backup SAM file is created by default and typically not deleted by system
administrators. The backup file is unprotected but compressed, meaning that you
must decompress the file to obtain the hash files. You can use the expand utility to
do this. The command is Expand [FILE] [DESTINATION]. Here is an example of
expanding the SAM file into the decompressed SAM file.
C:\> expand SAM uncompressedSAM
To enhance the security from offline hacking, Microsoft Windows 2000 and
newer versions include a SYSKEY utility. The SYSKEY utility encrypts the hashed
passwords in the SAM file using the 128-bit encryption key, which is a different
key for each installation.
