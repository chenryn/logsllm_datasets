I had an interesting idea for a new mode for FancyZones. Not sure if i'd use
it all the time, but it could be useful in some situations.
Imagine a "flow mode" that works sort of like the way a browser "flows"
elements. When you open new windows it would resize the current windows and
re-layout the windows to fit them all.
Obviously there would have to be some limit or it would become unusable after
a point, but the idea would be to dynamically resize the zones to fit content.
Anyone else find this a useful idea? Or just an annoying hinderance?
