Current version (0.11) seems to have `replace: true` work for components with
multiple root elements, but v-with breaks with no warning.

    var ComponentA = Vue.extend({
        //template: '{{bar}}', // this works
        template: '{{bar}}', // this doesn't
        replace: true
    });
    new Vue({
        el: 'body',
        template: '',
        data: {
            foo: 'Test Test Test Test'
        },
        components: {
            'component-a': ComponentA
        }
    });
