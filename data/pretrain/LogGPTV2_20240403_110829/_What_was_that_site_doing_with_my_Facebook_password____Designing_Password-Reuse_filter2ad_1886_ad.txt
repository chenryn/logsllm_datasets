actions related to changing passwords, but for services other than
the one that sent them the notification.
Most respondents perceived unique passwords as good for
security. Overall, 86.0 % of respondents agreed that changing their
AcmeCo password to “a completely new password unrelated to the
old one” would improve their account security. Most cited a “better
safe than sorry” rationale for changing their password. For example,

Figure 5: Respondents’ intentions for creating new pass-
words for their account on AcmeCo (who sent the notifica-
tion) and on other providers. Respondents could change all
passwords, only passwords that were the same or similar,
only passwords for important accounts, or none at all.

Figure 6: Of respondents who intended to change passwords,
their stated strategies for doing so for their account on
AcmeCo and on other providers. They could generate a new
password with a password manager or browser, make a com-
pletely new password, modify the old password, reuse a pass-
word they already use, or apply some other strategy.
R55 wrote, “It would bring me peace of mind to know I had done
what I could to protect myself and my account.” Yet, 34.6 % also
answered that changing their AcmeCo password to “a modifica-
tion...of the old one” would improve their account security, while
26.0 % answered similarly about changing their AcmeCo password
“to a password I use for another online account.”
To prevent password-reuse attacks, users should have a unique
password for each account, and 84.1 % of respondents agreed that
doing so would improve their account security. However, a concern-
ingly large fraction of respondents — 50.2 % — agreed that changing
“all of my similar passwords on other online accounts to one new
password” would improve their security. Unfortunately, doing so
makes them susceptible to future password-reuse attacks. We did
not observe significant differences in responses across conditions
for any of these six actions related to password changes.
If they received our notification in real life, respondents
would change their password, but ineffectively. The vast ma-
jority of respondents — 90.3 % — reported they would change their
passwords if, in real life, they received the notification they saw (Fig-
ure 5). However, among these respondents, only 1.4 % of them said
they would change their password to something completely un-
related. Additionally, only 9.7 % of them said they would use a
password manager or their browser to generate the password.
The majority of respondents’ new passwords would continue
to expose their accounts to the same risks (Figure 6). Most respon-
dents — 59.0 % — reported intending to create their new AcmeCo
password by changing a few characters in the old password, while
11.4 % reported intending to simply reuse another password they
already used elsewhere. In reality, these strategies would not truly
resolve their problems and would continue to facilitate password-
reuse attacks. Attackers have adapted to users’ tendency to modify
passwords in small ways (e.g., common character substitutions,
insertions, and capitalizations) and apply such common transforma-
tions in password-reuse attacks [10, 62]. Furthermore, self-reported
intentions typically overreport actual behavior [58], suggesting that
these results may already be overly optimistic.
Respondents’ stated likelihood to “leave [their AcmeCo] pass-
word as-is” varied by condition (regression p = .012). Respondents
who saw model-{noOthers}-{noExtras} were more likely to say they
would keep their current password than those who saw model
(OR = 2.4, p = .042) or model-{noOthers} (W = 533, p = .040).
Respondents were also more likely to state the same if they had not
previously received a data-breach notification (OR = 1.4, p = .034)
or if they had a background in technology (OR = 1.5, p = .038). We
hypothesize this last result may stem from overconfidence.
Some perceptions of security also varied across demographic
factors. Female respondents were more likely to rate having unique
passwords for all accounts as secure (OR = 1.5, p = .012) and less
likely to rate keeping their current password as secure (OR = 0.6,
p = .008). Respondents who had not previously received a data-
breach notification were more likely to rate modifying their old
password as secure (OR = 1.4, p = .017) and less likely to rate
changing it to something unrelated as secure (OR = 0.6, p = .002).
Surprisingly, respondents with a background in technology were
also less likely to rate the latter as secure (OR = 0.6, p = .007).
Those who avoid password changes may do so due to sus-
picion of notifications or invincibility beliefs. Of the 52 re-
spondents (9 % of the total) who said they would not change their
password, 25 reported that it was because they would need to verify
that the notification was legitimate, rather than a phishing attack.
R534 elaborated that they would “wait and go to AcmeCo’s website
and see what was going on first.” Eight others said they would not
change their password because of memorability concerns.
Seventeen respondents expressed various beliefs of invincibility:
eleven said they use unique passwords on every account and thus
would not worry about one password being compromised, while
six believed their passwords were strong enough to eliminate the
risk of compromise. As R2 wrote, “It is a very good password and I
doubt someone would waste the time trying to crack it.” While non-
experts have difficulties judging password strength [60], Pearman
et al. observed in an in-situ study of 154 participants an average
password strength that could resist up to 1012 guesses [44]. At the
same time, real-world offline guessing attacks are on the order of 109
to 1012 guesses per day on a single GPU even against hash functions
like scrypt [25]. Others consider 1014 guesses realistic in offline
attacks [18]. While rate-limiting and risk-based authentication slow
online guessing [21], password reuse remains a threat [38, 57].
Most respondents believed changing passwords for other
accounts with similar passwords would improve security, yet
they did not intend to do so. Even though, as previously men-
tioned, 84.1 % of respondents agreed that using unique passwords
for each of their accounts would improve security, 35.2 % of respon-
dents reported that they did not intend to change passwords for
