"Reveal in tree view" does not always put tree view selection on revealed
file. It seems to depend on the previous selection/collapse state of the tree
view. Here's an example of a repro:
![treeview](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/80917/7506811/06d06e0c-f41a-11e4-861f-22bfcaa77251.gif)
Note that if you just collapse the tree and then reveal the file, it works
fine, but if you change the selection to the other directory, then collapse
the tree, then choosing "reveal in treeview" expands the tree to reveal the
correct file, but the selection stays on the root directory.
