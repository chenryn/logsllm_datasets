User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题escaping double quotes and percent signs (%) in cron The following command works from prompt but not from crontab.

 grep abc  /var/log/messages | grep "`date '+%B %d'`" | mail -s"abc log of `hostname`" shantanu.oak+`hostname`@gmail.com


I need to add it to daily cron.

Assistant: You have to escape the % signs. They have a special meaning in crontabs:

man (5) crontab:

Percent-signs (%) in the command, unless escaped with backslash (\), 
will be changed into newline characters, and all data after the 
first % will be sent to the command as standard input.
