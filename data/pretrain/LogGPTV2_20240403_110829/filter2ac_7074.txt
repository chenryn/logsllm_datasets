### Title: 19 Fantastic Red-Team Attacks and How to Detect Them

Over the past year, red team testing in organizations has revealed a significant increase in detections mapped to the MITRE ATT&CKâ„¢ framework across Windows, Linux, and macOS. However, many organizations still overlook several key techniques that often blend in with routine user operations. For example:

1. **Trusted Developer Utilities**: These utilities, which are often available on standard user endpoints (not just developer workstations), can be exploited to execute malicious code.
2. **XSL Script Processing**: Trusted utilities that process XSL scripts can be used as an attack vector, as they can consume and execute embedded scripts.
3. **.NET Default Binaries**: Tools like InstallUtil, Regsvcs, and AddInProcess are known to allow unauthorized execution, making them potential vectors for attacks.

The combination of these techniques, along with procedural challenges such as alert fatigue and a lack of understanding of environmental norms, makes reliable detection of these events extremely difficult.

This talk will summarize the prevalent and ongoing gaps in organizational defenses, as uncovered by testing against a broad spectrum of attacks using Atomic Red Team. Many of these adversary behaviors are not isolated but span multiple events in an event stream, which may be separated by arbitrary and inconsistent nuisance events.

To address these challenges, we introduce and demonstrate the open-sourced Event Query Language (EQL). EQL is event-agnostic and can be used to create high signal-to-noise analytics that close these behavioral gaps. It allows for the crafting of analytics that can link evidence across long sequences of log data.

In a live demonstration, we will showcase powerful yet easy-to-craft analytics that can detect adversarial behavior most commonly missed by organizations today.
