response to them. Then, in each aggregation interval Ia(see Section 4.3) a node
has been considered as being under attack if at least one of the tagged packets

The network wide average results obtained in terms of DR and FPR, by
using diﬀerent T2 values have been depicted on Fig. 8 and 9. These numbers are
computed by averaging the performance of all 25 anomaly detectors over the
entire test interval. The curves demonstrate that in highly partitioned networks
with very diﬀerent conditions it is not feasible to analyse the results of the
detection mechanism on an aggregate basis using these metrics. While the earlier
results were convincing about the success of the approach, these curves show
mediocre results overall.
We have observed that the traﬃc ﬂow, the type of attack, and the number
of attackers in each partition produce very diﬀerent detection rates. The net-
work topology in our disaster area is composed of eight partitions more or less
stable along the whole simulation, with moving nodes acting as ”bridges” over
the partitions. Analysing the results node by node we have conﬁrmed that the
parameter with more inﬂuence over the detection performance is the proximity
of the adversaries to the fair nodes. Table 1 show the best, worst, and aver-
age DR and FPR, for the continuous draining and grey hole attacks. Results
in each column are categorised into diﬀerent classes. Each class (diﬀerent rows
as described in column 1) shows the results aggregated for partitions that have
similar number of adversaries, i.e. partions with no adversaries, partitions with
1 adversary, and so on. There are around 1/3 of the fair nodes in each class. The
results, calculated with the alert aggregation threshold T2 at 5%, demonstrate
that the less the partition is aﬀected by attacks the worse is the performance of
the detection. That is, the classes with zero and one adversary are the ones that
reduce the average detection performance. Note that despite having partitions
with no adversaries, some attacks are received by sporadic contacts with other
partitions.
Another aspect which has been observed is that in the transient cases the false
positive rate is a bit lower than in the continuous cases. The reason is that the

Table 1: Detection performance for the continuous attacks
attacks are always detected with a small delay, but the alarm also persists when
the attack is ﬁnished. Since the attack is not continuously received uniformly by
all the nodes, because of their mobility, there are some gaps during which the
alarms are enabled and counted as false positives. The continuous attacks are
longer and present more of these gaps. This shows, once again, the complexity
of the performance accounting using these metrics.
6 Conclusions
In this article we have presented a holistic anomaly detection and mitigation ap-
proach for dissemination protocols for intermittently connected networks. The
approach has been integrated and evaluated in the Random Walk Gossip dis-
semination protocol applied within a disaster area scenario.
We have adopted a statistical-based detector algorithm to combat the typical
resource constraints associated with the devices with respect to CPU power used
for learning and detection. The threat model for which the approach has been
validated focuses on making a big impact on fair nodes with little invested energy
by the adversary. Moreover, the adversary behaviour is so similar to the normal
behaviour that is hard to distinguish the attacks by creation of constraints,
signatures or rules. So this environment is indeed a challenging environment.
Taking into account this threat model we have had to add a mitigation mode
to the basic protocol operation. When in this mode, small modiﬁcations in the
protocol create a chance of deciding when the own behaviour has to be changed
due to a suspected attack. This is diﬀerent from earlier works where identiﬁcation
of the culprit and individual isolation or speciﬁc treatment is the response. The
integrated protocol can of course be run in the original no-mitigation mode
when no attacks are expected and then no protection is provided either. Hence,
the added detection-mitigation algorithm can be seen as an enhancement of an
earlier protocol that works in a fair-play scenario. We believe this way of thinking
can be generalised and applied in other dissemination protocols too.
Furthermore, our approach assumes full knowledge of the adversary about
the protocol and even the anomaly detection scheme. The adversary cannot
easily adapt to avoid detection by the algorithm due to the unpredictability of
what learning has accomplished in the normality model. This is a simple and
powerful aspect of our scheme.
The evaluation of the approach has demonstrated its eﬀectiveness by show-
ing resistance to the attacks using network performance metrics. In two attack
modes, transient and continuous, we have shown that mitigation brings back the
network to performance levels close to pre-attack scenarios. The analysis has also
highlighted the complexity of using the classic metrics, detection rate and false
positive rate, in highly partitioned networks. These metrics are not appropriate
to measure the detection performance on a global basis in highly partitioned
networks.
Future work includes identifying the applicability of the methods to more
attack types, an intermittent version of the current attacks, and the addition of
new threat models. It is also interesting to explore which parts of this resilience to
attacks can be beneﬁcially integrated into the dissemination algorithm. Current
work includes the addition of two new components to the detection-mitigation
loop. First, a diagnosis element that runs in parallel with a general (early) mit-
igation. This would be useful to adapting the mitigation without pinpointing
attacker nodes. Second, an adaptive component that decides when and how to
end a given mitigation phase, and a return to the less careful mode.
Another aspect in which more research is required is the study of impact of
mitigation actions. When a node enables the mitigation, in some cases this may
change the behaviour of the system and can be detected as an anomaly creating
a recursive chain of alarms among the nodes. This is a complex problem because
the behaviour of the system can be aﬀected by the mitigation actions applied
by all the nodes.
