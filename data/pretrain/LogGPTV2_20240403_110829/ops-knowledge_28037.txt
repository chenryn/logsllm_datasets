User: I have a bunch of files that I need to print via PDF printer and after it is printed I need to perform additional tasks, but only when it is finally completed. 
So to do this from my python script i call command "lpr path/to/file.doc -P PDF"
But this command immediately returns 0 and I have no way to track when printing process is finished, was it successful or not etc... 
There is an option to send email when printing is done, but to wait for email after I start printing looks very hacky to me. 
Do you have some ideas how to get this done?
Edit 1
There are a plenty of ways to check if printer is printing something at current moment. Therefore at the moment after I start printing something I run lpq command every 0.5 second to find out if it is still printing. But this looks to m e not the best way to do it. I want to be able get alerted or something when actual printing process is finished. Was it successful or not etc...
Assistant: You can check the state of the printer using the lpstat command (man lpstat). To wait for a process to finish, get the PID of the process and pass it wait command as argument
