Its main task is to automatically compile, test, and deploy software code, and provide a control panel to monitor and manage the entire software delivery process. Jenkins can also integrate with other tools and plugins such as GitHub, Docker, and Slack to improve the efficiency and quality of the automation process. In the software delivery process, Jenkins can help reduce manual work and errors, and facilitate faster, more stable, and more consistent software releases.
