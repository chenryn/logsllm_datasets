It's a very light bug. When I start atom ide, it correctly picks up where I
left, but scroll-bars as you can see are not correctly rendered. If I click on
another tab, scroll-bars now gets rendered correctly. Same happens with tree-
view, I have to press Ctrl-k + Ctrl-b to hide it first and then again Ctrl-k +
Ctrl-b to show it again which renders scroll-bars properly.
Thought, it might help :)
