Ô¨Åle and then deleted it. Finally, the malicious binary drops a
batch Ô¨Åle that deletes attack footprints, including the malicious
binary itself.

Scenario-3: Trojan. In this attack (Fig. 20), a user is
convinced to download a malicious Trojan program (texteditor)
via Firefox. Next, the user moves the executable Ô¨Åle to another
directory, changes its name (tedit), and Ô¨Ånally executes it.
After the execution, a C&C channel is created, and a reverse
shell is provided to the attacker. The attacker launches a shell
prompt and executes information gathering commands like
hostname, whoami, ifconÔ¨Åg, and netstat. The attacker then
deploys another malicious Ô¨Åle, exÔ¨Åltrates information, and
Ô¨Ånally cleans up his footprints. This scenario differs from
Trojan-1 because it has an additional activity that remotely
deploys a new malicious executable.
Scenario-4: Spyware. This attack (Fig. 21) begins when
the red-team compromises Firefox. The user on the victim
host then loaded a hijacked remote URL. Next, a shellcode
from the URL is executed to connect to a C&C server from
which it downloaded a malicious binary, wrote it to disk, and
executed it. The execution of the malicious binary results in a
reverse shell channel for C&C communications. The attacker
then ran the shell command, resulting in a new cmd.exe
process and a new connection to the C&C server. The operator
ran reconnaissance commands (hostname, whoami, ipconÔ¨Åg,
netstat, uname). The attacker then exÔ¨Åltrated the password.txt

Scenario-5.1: Eternal Blue. This APT exploits vulnerable

22), Meterpreter [1] was used with the recently implemented
Eternal Blue exploit and Double Pulsar reÔ¨Çective loading
capabilities. The attacker exploited the listening SMB service
on port 445 of the target. A shellcode was then down-
loaded and executed on the target. The shellcode performed
process injection into the lsass.exe process.
lsass.exe then
launched rundll32.exe, which connected to the C&C server
and downloaded-and-executed Meterpreter. Next, Meterpreter
exÔ¨Åltrated a sensitive Ô¨Åle and cleared Windows event logs.

Scenario-5.2: RAT. In this attack (Fig. 23), Firefox nav-
igates to a malicious website and gets exploited. Then, a
Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is uploaded to the victim‚Äôs
machine and executed. After execution, a connection to the
C&C server has happened, and the malicious RAT is deleted.
This attack scenario is incomplete, and no harm is done.

Scenario-6: Web-Shell. The assumption in this attack (Fig.
24) is that Nginx web server has a vulnerability that gives
the attacker access to run arbitrary commands on the server
(similar to Shellshock bug). As a result, the attacker exÔ¨Åltrates
a sensitive Ô¨Åle. The important insight here is that by capturing
sufÔ¨Åciently strong APT signals of an ongoing attack through

TTP matching, HOLMES accurately Ô¨Çags an APT, even when
a critical APT step is missing (initial compromise in this case).
Scenario-7.1: RAT. A vulnerable Nginx server was in-
stalled during the setup period. The attacker exploits the
Nginx server by throwing a malicious shell-code. Nginx runs
the malicious shell-code which results in the download and
execution of a malicious RAT. Next, RAT connects to a
C&C server and gives administrative privileges to the remote
attacker. The attacker remotely executes some commands. It
then deploys some malicious Python scripts and exÔ¨Åltrates
information. The HSG of this attack is shown in Fig. 25.
