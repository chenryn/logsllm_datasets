### Example
    class FactoryDependency:
        # go through api_key validation
        def call_api_key(self, a= Depends(get_api_key)):
            ...
        # go through jwt validation
        def call_jwt(self, b = Depends(auth)):
            ...
        async def __call__(self, request: Request):
            headers = request.headers
            api_key = case_insensitive_search(headers, "API-KEY")
            if api_key:
                self.call_api_key()
            else:
                self.call_jwt() 
            ...
### Description
I would like to use a factory dependency for authenticating users to access
backend endpoints. Currently, my system supports two ways of authentication:
one using api-key and one using jwt. If the user provides either one of them
(first check for api-key in the header and if its not, then check for bearer
token), the authentication is passed. Would it be possible to have such
dependency that performs the check and calls the correct authentication
dependency (JWT dependency or Key dependency)? I've gone through Dependencies
section of the documentation, but not really sure if calling other
dependencies inside a dependency is supported in FastAPI. I tried the above
example, but when either of the two methods (`call_api_key` or `call_jwt` is
called, the dependency doesn't seem to work). Any insights would be greatly
appreciated!
