ABSTRACT
The blockchain emerges as an innovative tool which proves to be
useful in a number of application scenarios. A number of large in-
dustrial players, such as IBM, Microsoft, Intel, and NEC, are cur-
rently investing in exploiting the blockchain in order to enrich their
portfolio of products. A number of researchers and practitioners
speculate that the blockchain technology can change the way we
see a number of online applications today. Although it is still early
to tell for sure, it is expected that the blockchain will stimulate con-
siderable changes to a large number of products and will positively
impact the digital experience of many individuals around the globe.
In this tutorial, we overview, detail, and analyze the security pro-
visions of Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain—effectively cap-
turing recently reported attacks and threats in the system. Our con-
tributions go beyond the mere analysis of reported vulnerabilities
of Bitcoin; namely, we describe and evaluate a number of coun-
termeasures to deter threats on the system—some of which have
already been incorporated in the system. Recall that Bitcoin has
been forked multiple times in order to ﬁne-tune the consensus (i.e.,
the block generation time and the hash function), and the network
parameters (e.g., the size of blocks). As such, the results reported
in this tutorial are not only restricted to Bitcoin, but equally apply
to a number of “altcoins” which are basically clones/forks of the
Bitcoin source code.
Given the increasing number of alternative blockchain propos-
als, this tutorial extracts the basic security lessons learnt from the
Bitcoin system with the aim to foster better designs and analysis of
next-generation secure blockchain currencies and technologies.
1. BITCOIN’S BLOCKCHAIN
First introduced in 2008, Bitcoin has witnessed more adoption
and attention than any other digital currency to date. Bitcoin is cur-
rently integrated across several businesses and has several exchange
markets.
Users in Bitcoin execute payments by digitally signing their trans-
actions and are prevented from double-spending their coins (i.e.,
signing-over the same coin to two different users) through a dis-
tributed time-stamping service. This service operates on top of the

Bitcoin Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network that ensures that all transac-
tions and their order of execution are available to all Bitcoin users.
To this end, Bitcoin relies on a Proof-of-Work (PoW) scheme
that allows users to “mine” for digital coins by performing compu-
tations. More speciﬁcally, to generate a block, Bitcoin peers must
ﬁnd a nonce value that, when hashed with additional ﬁelds (i.e., the
Merkle hash of all valid and received transactions, the hash of the
previous block, and a timestamp), the result is below a given target
value. If such a nonce is found, peers then include it (as well as
the additional ﬁelds) in a block thus allowing any entity to publicly
verify the PoW. Upon successfully generating a block, a peer is typ-
ically granted a number of new BTCs. This provides an incentive
for peers to continuously support Bitcoin. The resulting block is
forwarded to all users in the network, who can then check its cor-
rectness by verifying the hash computation. If the block is deemed
to be “valid”, then the users append it to their previously accepted
blocks, thus growing the Bitcoin block chain. Bitcoin relies on this
mechanism to resist double-spending attacks; for malicious users to
double-spend a BTC without being detected, they would not only
have to redo all the work required to compute the block where that
BTC was spent, but also they need to recompute all the subsequent
blocks in the chain.
Although the literature features a number of blockchain propos-
als, most existing blockchains leverage (a variant of) Bitcoin’s ex-
pensive Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which cur-
rently accounts for more than 90% of the total market capitalization
of existing digital currencies.
In the last couple of years, most research was focused on the pro-
visions of Bitcoin as a digital currency. Studies were analyzing the
security and privacy of making payments in Bitcoin, the underly-
ing economy of Bitcoin, etc. but completely overlooked a hidden
potential within Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is indeed powered by a truly genuine breakthrough, the
blockchain. This blockchain is the main engine on which Bitcoin
is built, emerges as a novel distributed consensus scheme which
allows transactions, and any other data, to be securely stored and
veriﬁed without any centralized authority. As such, the blockchain
fueled innovation, and a number of innovative applications have
already been devised by exploiting the secure and distributed pro-
visions of the blockchain.
However, existing experience with Bitcoin’s blockchain reveals
that there are still many challenges that need to be overcome:
Security Recent studies have shown a number of practical attacks [2–
4] on Bitcoin. These attacks leverage weaknesses in the net-
work and consensus layers of Bitcoin’s blockchain in order
to considerably increase the advantage of an adversary.
Scalability Currently, the Bitcoin blockchain can process a max-
imum of 7 transactions per second; this number is only ex-
1861bilities of Bitcoin; namely, we describe and evaluate a number of
countermeasures to deter threats on the system—some of which
have already been incorporated in the system. Recall that Bitcoin
has been forked multiple times in order to ﬁne-tune the consensus
(i.e., the block generation time and the hash function), and the net-
work parameters (e.g., the size of blocks). For instance, Litecoin
and Dogecoin—Bitcoin’s most prominent forks—reduce the block
generation time from 10 to 2.5 and 1 minute respectively. As such,
the results reported in this tutorial are not only restricted to Bitcoin,
but equally apply to a number of “altcoins” which are basically
clones/forks of the Bitcoin source code.
Finally, we analyze the limits of decentralization in the Bitcoin
ecosystem. Namely, based on recent incidents and observations, we
show that the vital operations and decisions that Bitcoin is currently
undertaking are not decentralized. More speciﬁcally, we show that
a limited set of entities currently control the services, decision mak-
ing, mining, and the incident resolution processes in Bitcoin. We
also show that third-party entities can unilaterally decide to “de-
value” any speciﬁc set of Bitcoin addresses pertaining to any entity
participating in the system.

pected to increase. If the blockchain were to be used as a
decentralized storage medium or were to process the trans-
actional volume of Visa (around 50,000 transactions per sec-
ond), there are serious concerns about the scalability of the
current blockchain design.
Limits of (De-)centralization One of the main attractions of the
blockchain lies in its decentralized aspects; the protocol is
indeed fully decentralized and each entity in the network
“votes” with its computing power. Although the protocol
is designed for full de-centralization, a recent study [1] has
shown the limits of decentralization in the current deploy-
ment blockchain. Currently, only few entities can control
the entire process, since participants have considerable in-
centives to pool their computing power in centralized pro-
cesses in order to increase their advantage in the network.
There are currently several attempts to re-design the proof
of work scheme in the blockchain in order to resolve these
problems.
2. CONTENTS OF THE TUTORIAL
In this 1.5 hour tutorial, we thoroughly analyze the security pro-
visions of Bitcoin in light of recent published attacks, and we dis-
cuss possible countermeasures. For instance, we show that the ini-
tial measures adopted in Bitcoin to handle fast payments are not
enough to deter double-spending attacks, and discuss a ﬁrst work-
able countermeasure against double-spending which is currently in-
tegrated in Bitcoin. Fast payments refer to payments where the time
between the exchange of currency and goods is short (in the order
of a minute). While the Bitcoin PoW-based time-stamping mecha-
nism is essential for the detection of double-spending attacks (i.e,
in which an adversary attempts to use some of her coins for two or
more payments), it requires tens of minutes to verify a transaction
and is therefore inappropriate for fast payments. Clearly, there is
only limited value in verifying the payment after the user has ob-
tained the goods (and e.g., left the store) or services (e.g., access to
on-line content).
We also show that an adversary can deny the delivery of blocks
and transactions to victim Bitcoin nodes for a considerable amount
of time. We show that this can be achieved by exploiting Bitcoin
bandwidth optimization techniques and the measures that are in
place to tolerate network delays and congestion. The minimal re-
quirement for this attack to succeed in practice is simply that the
attacker can establish at least one connection to the victim. An
even more powerful attack resulting in almost indeﬁnite delays at
the victim node only requires that the attacker can ﬁll the victim’s
remaining open connection slots—without necessarily causing any
network partitioning in the Bitcoin network.
These results therefore motivate the need for a careful design
of the scalability mechanisms adopted in Bitcoin. While exist-
ing mechanisms limit the amount of propagated information in the
system to the minimum necessary, we show that these techniques
come at odds with security and reduce the ability of the network to
e.g., detect double-spending attacks, resolve, or prevent blockchain
forks. For instance, these ﬁndings suggest that an adversary who
commands more than 33% of the computing power in the network
can control the fate and security of all Bitcoin transactions. In this
respect, we describe a modiﬁcation of the block request process
in Bitcoin to deter this misbehavior. Finally, in this chapter, we
discuss the security of online wallets and outline a number of in-
novative techniques to ensure the protection of private keys against
compromise and/or loss.
