## Abstract

The blockchain has emerged as an innovative tool with broad applications. Major industrial players, including IBM, Microsoft, Intel, and NEC, are investing in blockchain technology to enhance their product portfolios. Many researchers and practitioners speculate that blockchain could revolutionize various online applications. Although it is still early to predict the full impact, it is anticipated that blockchain will significantly influence a wide range of products and improve the digital experience for many individuals globally.

In this tutorial, we provide a comprehensive overview, detailed analysis, and evaluation of the security provisions of Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain, focusing on recent attacks and threats. Our contributions extend beyond analyzing reported vulnerabilities; we also describe and evaluate several countermeasures, some of which have already been integrated into the system. Notably, Bitcoin has undergone multiple forks to fine-tune the consensus (e.g., block generation time and hash function) and network parameters (e.g., block size). Therefore, the insights and findings in this tutorial are applicable not only to Bitcoin but also to many "altcoins" that are based on the Bitcoin source code.

Given the growing number of alternative blockchain proposals, this tutorial distills key security lessons from the Bitcoin system to inform better designs and analyses of next-generation secure blockchain currencies and technologies.

## 1. Bitcoin’s Blockchain

Bitcoin, introduced in 2008, has seen more adoption and attention than any other digital currency to date. It is now integrated into various businesses and has multiple exchange markets.

In Bitcoin, users execute payments by digitally signing transactions, and the system prevents double-spending through a distributed time-stamping service. This service operates on the Bitcoin Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network, ensuring that all transactions and their order of execution are available to all Bitcoin users.

To generate a block, Bitcoin relies on a Proof-of-Work (PoW) scheme. Peers must find a nonce value that, when hashed with additional fields (the Merkle hash of all valid and received transactions, the hash of the previous block, and a timestamp), produces a result below a given target value. If such a nonce is found, peers include it in a block, allowing public verification of the PoW. Successfully generating a block typically grants the peer a number of new BTCs, providing an incentive for continuous support. The resulting block is then forwarded to all users in the network, who can verify its correctness. If the block is deemed valid, it is appended to the existing blockchain, thereby growing the chain. This mechanism helps resist double-spending attacks, as malicious users would need to redo the work for the block where the BTC was spent and all subsequent blocks.

Although there are many blockchain proposals, most existing blockchains use a variant of Bitcoin's PoW consensus mechanism, which currently accounts for over 90% of the total market capitalization of digital currencies.

Recent research has focused on the security and privacy of Bitcoin as a digital currency, the underlying economy, and other aspects, but often overlooked the broader potential of the blockchain. The blockchain is the core engine of Bitcoin, offering a novel distributed consensus scheme that allows secure and decentralized storage and verification of transactions and data.

However, Bitcoin's blockchain faces several challenges:

### Security
Recent studies have identified practical attacks on Bitcoin, leveraging weaknesses in the network and consensus layers to increase the advantage of adversaries.

### Scalability
Currently, the Bitcoin blockchain can process a maximum of 7 transactions per second, which is insufficient for high-volume applications like Visa, which processes around 50,000 transactions per second.

### Limits of Decentralization
Despite the protocol's design for full decentralization, recent studies show that a few entities can control the entire process due to the incentives for pooling computing power. Efforts are underway to redesign the PoW scheme to address these issues.

## 2. Contents of the Tutorial

In this 1.5-hour tutorial, we thoroughly analyze Bitcoin's security provisions in light of recent published attacks and discuss possible countermeasures. For example, we show that initial measures to handle fast payments in Bitcoin are inadequate to deter double-spending attacks and propose a workable countermeasure that is now integrated into the system. Fast payments refer to transactions where the time between the exchange of currency and goods is short (about a minute). While Bitcoin's PoW-based time-stamping mechanism is essential for detecting double-spending, it requires tens of minutes to verify a transaction, making it unsuitable for fast payments.

We also demonstrate that an adversary can deny the delivery of blocks and transactions to victim Bitcoin nodes for a considerable amount of time by exploiting Bitcoin's bandwidth optimization techniques and measures for tolerating network delays and congestion. The minimal requirement for this attack is that the attacker can establish at least one connection to the victim. A more powerful attack, causing almost indefinite delays, requires the attacker to fill the victim's remaining open connection slots without necessarily causing network partitioning.

These findings highlight the need for careful design of scalability mechanisms in Bitcoin. While existing mechanisms limit the propagation of information, they can compromise security and reduce the network's ability to detect double-spending, resolve, or prevent blockchain forks. For instance, an adversary with more than 33% of the computing power can control the fate and security of all Bitcoin transactions. We describe a modification of the block request process to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we discuss the security of online wallets and outline innovative techniques to protect private keys against compromise or loss.

This tutorial goes beyond mere vulnerability analysis, providing actionable insights and solutions to enhance the security and scalability of blockchain systems.
