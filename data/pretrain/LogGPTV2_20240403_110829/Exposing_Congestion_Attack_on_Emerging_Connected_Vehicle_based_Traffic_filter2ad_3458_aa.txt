Abstract—Connected vehicle (CV) technology will soon trans-
form today’s transportation systems by connecting vehicles and
the transportation infrastructure through wireless communi-
cation. Having demonstrated the potential to greatly improve
transportation mobility efﬁciency, such dramatically increased
connectivity also opens a new door for cyber attacks. In this
work, we perform the ﬁrst detailed security analysis of the next-
generation CV-based transportation systems. As a ﬁrst step, we
target the USDOT (U.S. Department of Transportation) sponsored
CV-based trafﬁc control system, which has been tested and shown
high effectiveness in real road intersections. In the analysis, we
target a realistic threat, namely CV data spooﬁng from one single
attack vehicle, with the attack goal of creating trafﬁc congestion.
We ﬁrst analyze the system design and identify data spooﬁng
strategies that can potentially inﬂuence the trafﬁc control. Based
on the strategies, we perform vulnerability analysis by exhaus-
tively trying all the data spooﬁng options for these strategies
to understand the upper bound of the attack effectiveness. For
the highly effective cases, we analyze the causes and ﬁnd that
the current signal control algorithm design and implementation
choices are highly vulnerable to data spooﬁng attacks from even
a single attack vehicle. These vulnerabilities can be exploited
to completely reverse the beneﬁt of the CV-based signal control
system by causing the trafﬁc mobility to be 23.4% worse than
that without adopting such system. We then construct practical
exploits and evaluate them under real-world intersection settings.
The evaluation results are consistent with our vulnerability
analysis, and we ﬁnd that the attacks can even cause a blocking
effect to jam an entire approach. In the jamming period, 22%
of the vehicles need to spend over 7 minutes for an original half-
minute trip, which is 14 times higher. We also discuss defense
directions leveraging the insights from our analysis.

INTRODUCTION
Connected vehicle (CV) technology will soon transform to-
day’s transportation systems. In September 2016, the USDOT
(U.S. Department of Transportation) launched the CV Pilot
Program as a national effort to deploy, test, and operationalize
a series of CV-based transportation systems [12], [2]. In these
systems, vehicles and infrastructure are connected through
wireless communication, and leverage such connectivity to
improve mobility, safety, environmental impact, and public

agency operations. These systems are currently under testing
in three cities including New York City [12]. To push for a
nationwide deployment, USDOT has already proposed to man-
date all new light-duty vehicles to equip CV technology [11].
While having a great potential, such dramatically increased
connectivity also opens a new door for cyber attacks. To ensure
the security of vehicles and transportation infrastructure and
the safety of drivers and pedestrians, it is highly important to
understand potential security vulnerabilities so that they can
be proactively addressed before nationwide deployment.
In this work, we perform the ﬁrst security analysis on the
next-generation CV-based transportation systems. As a ﬁrst
step, we target the USDOT sponsored design and implemen-
tation of a system called Intelligent Trafﬁc Signal System
(I-SIG), which performs one of the most basic urban trafﬁc
operations,
trafﬁc signal control. In this system, real-time
vehicle trajectory data transmitted using the CV technology
are used to intelligently control the duration and sequence of
trafﬁc signals. Such system is fully implemented and has been
tested on real road intersections in Anthem, AZ, and Palo
Alto, CA, and has shown to achieve a 26.6% reduction in
total vehicle delay [6]. In this study, our goal is to identify
fundamental security challenges, especially those speciﬁc to
CV-based trafﬁc control. Thus, we are particularly interested in
security problems that are at the signal control algorithm level
and are caused by design or implementation choices instead
of implementation bugs. The analysis results are expected
to serve as a guideline for understanding whether and why
the current design or implementation choices in the I-SIG
system are vulnerable, as well as providing insights on how to
fundamentally secure it before large-scale deployment.
The only attack requirement in our study is that attackers
can compromise the vehicle-side devices on their own vehicles
or other people’s vehicles, and send malicious CV messages to
the I-SIG system to inﬂuence the trafﬁc control decisions. As
reported by previous work, such compromise can be performed
physically [29], wirelessly [20], or through malware [34]. Also,
we assume that the vehicle certiﬁcate system developed by
USDOT (§II-A) can correctly authenticate all CV messages.
Thus, instead of the sender identity, the attack vehicle can
only spoof its trajectory data, e.g., speed and location, in the
CV messages. To maximize the realism, in this paper we
assume that only one attack vehicle exists in an intersection.
This ensures that both our analysis and the discovered security
problems have high practical implications.
With such a threat model, the attack goal in our analysis
is to create congestion in an intersection. Trafﬁc signal control
has been proven to be one of the most cost effective way
to increase transportation productivity, and thus it is highly
important to ensure its correct and efﬁcient functioning. This
is exactly the reason why the USDOT focuses on deploying the
CV-based signal control system [12]. Thus, as the ﬁrst security
study, this work focuses on identifying the congestion creation
vulnerabilities, aiming at directly subvert such design goals.
We ﬁrst analyze the I-SIG system design and identify a
set of trajectory data spooﬁng strategies that can potentially
inﬂuence the signal control algorithms used in the system. We
then enumerate all the data spooﬁng options for the identiﬁed
strategies on the I-SIG system to understand the upper bound
of the congestion attack effectiveness. A commercial-grade
trafﬁc simulation software, PTV VISSIM [8],
is used to
generate synthetic trafﬁc snapshots as the input to the I-SIG
system for this analysis. Based on the results, we analyze the
causes for the highly effective attack results, and construct
practical exploits under real-world attack resource constraints.
In our analysis, we ﬁnd that data spooﬁng attacks are highly
effective for the signal control algorithm with the default
conﬁgurations in I-SIG: the spoofed trajectory data from one
single attack vehicle is able to increase the total delay by as
high as 68.1%, which completely reverses the beneﬁt of using
the I-SIG system (26.6% decrease) and cause the mobility
to be even 23.4% worse than that without using the I-SIG
system. This is very surprising, since the I-SIG system uses
an optimal signal control algorithm that can minimize the
total delay of typically over 100 vehicles in an intersection.
Thus, the data from a single vehicle should not have such
signiﬁcant inﬂuence. We ﬁnd that this is due to a vulnerability
at the signal control algorithm level, which we call the last
vehicle advantage, meaning that the latest arriving vehicle can
determine the signal plan. Fundamentally, we ﬁnd that this is
due to a trade off between security and deployability: due to the
limited computation power on the infrastructure-side devices,
the developers are forced to choose a less optimal conﬁguration
of the theoretically optimal signal control algorithm, which
unexpectedly exposes the congestion creation vulnerability.
Even though the deployability issue exists today, this prob-
lem may be resolvable in the future when the infrastructure-
side devices have more computation power. Thus, we then
analyze whether the I-SIG system is still vulnerable with more
optimal conﬁgurations. In such scenario, we ﬁnd that data
spooﬁng attacks can still be highly effective when the I-SIG
system is in the operation mode for the transition period, i.e.,
when the market penetration rate (PR) of the CV technology
is lower than 95%. In such period, an algorithm that estimates
the status of unequipped vehicles, i.e., vehicles without CV
technology, is performed before the signal control algorithm.
This is because the signal control algorithm can be very
ineffective due to lack of visibility of the unequipped vehicles,
but we ﬁnd that this allows the attacker to manipulate such
estimation process to create congestion using spoofed data.
To understand the real-world implications of the identiﬁed
vulnerabilities, we construct and fully implement the exploits,
and evaluate them using simulations on a real-world intersec-
tion map. To increase the realism, we videotaped all trafﬁc
ﬂows in the intersection for one hour and manually counted
the passing vehicles as the input to the simulation model.
The results are consistent with our vulnerability analysis, and

approaches, causing massive trafﬁc jams.
surprisingly, we ﬁnd that the attacks can even cause a blocking
effect to jam an entire approach. Fig. 1 shows an snapshot in
the simulation when the blocking effect is created. As shown,
in the northbound, southbound, and eastbound approaches, the
vehicles in the left-turn lanes spill over and block the through
lanes, causing massive trafﬁc jams. In such jamming period,
22% of the vehicles need to spend over 7 minutes for an
originally half-minute trip, which is 14 times higher.
Based on our analysis, even though the I-SIG system
has shown high effectiveness in reducing trafﬁc delay in
benign settings, the current algorithm design and conﬁguration
choices are high vulnerable to data spooﬁng, and even the
data from one single attack vehicle is able to manipulate the
trafﬁc control to a great extent, causing massive congestion.
To addressed these problems, we discuss promising defense
directions leveraging the insights from our analysis.
We summarize our contributions as follows:
• We perform the ﬁrst security analysis of a CV-based
transportation system, the USDOT sponsored I-SIG system.
We formulate the problem with a highly realistic threat model,
data spooﬁng from one single attack vehicle, and analyze the
system design to identify a set of data spooﬁng strategies.
•
Targeting the goal of creating congestion, we ﬁrst
perform vulnerability analysis to understand the upper bound
of the attack effectiveness. We analyze the causes for the
highly effective cases, and ﬁnd that the current signal control
algorithm design and conﬁguration choices are highly vulner-
able to data spooﬁng from even a single attack vehicle. These
vulnerabilities exist throughout the full deployment and the
transition periods, and can cause the mobility to be even worse
than that without using the I-SIG system.

For the identiﬁed vulnerabilities, we construct prac-
tical exploits and evaluate them under real-world intersection
settings. The results validate the attack effectiveness; further-
more, for the transition period, the attacks can even create a
blocking effect that jams an entire approach.
II. BACKGROUND
In this section, we introduce the necessary background
about the CV technology and the I-SIG system design.
Security and Credential Management System (SCMS).
As one of the most importatnt infrastructure, the transpira-
tion systems are highly security and safety critical. Thus, to
enhance the communication security in the CV environment,
the USDOT will deploy the Security and Credential Manage-
ment System (SCMS) on both the vehicle and infrastructure
sides [15]. It is a Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI) system that
requires every BSM messages to be signed by the sender’s
digital certiﬁcates issued beforehand, and thus the receivers
can verify the signature before acting on it [15], [38].
A. CV Technology and Recent Advances
B. The I-SIG System
Connected vehicle (CV) technology uses wireless commu-
nications to connect vehicles and the infrastructure with the
goal of dramatically improving the transportation systems in
mobility, safety, environmental impact, and public agency op-
erations [12]. Due to the high data transmission requirement in
the transportation scenario, the DSRC (Dedicated Short Range
Communications) protocol is speciﬁcally designed for the CV
communication scenarios with dedicated band allocated by the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) [5].
The communication in the CV environment has two cate-
gories: vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, and vehicle-
to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. To support them, both
the vehicle and the infrastructure sides need to install DSRC
devices, which are called On-Board Units (OBUs) and Road-
side Units (RSUs) respectively. In such CV environment, vehi-
cles use OBUs to periodically broadcast Basic Safety Messages
(BSM) including its real-time trajectory data, e.g., location
and speed, to the surrounding vehicles and infrastructure. This
enables a series of safety functions on the vehicle side, e.g.,
blind spot and lane change warnings, and also enables the
trafﬁc infrastructure to leverage the real-time trafﬁc data to
improve trafﬁc control performance.
Recent advances in the CV deployment. With the DSRC
standard becoming mature [28], OBUs and RSUs products are
already on market today [1]. USDOT estimates that equipping
the OBUs would cost around $341 to $350 per vehicle in
2020 [13]. This makes the CV technology a very cost-effective
option to increase transportation system performance in prac-
tice, and the USDOT has already proposed to mandate all new
light-duty vehicles to equip OBUs [11]. The market penetration
rate will gradually increase after such mandate [16], and in our
analysis we call the vehicles with and without OBUs equipped
vehicles and unequipped vehicles respectively.
To foster the development of CV-based transportation sys-
tems, in 2010 the USDOT launched the Dynamic Mobility
Applications (DMA) research program and developed nearly
70 such systems, or CV applications [2]. To encourage service
providers, researchers, and application developers to partici-
pate, these applications are open sourced and are available free
to the public [7]. Built on the success of the DMA program, on
September 1, 2016, the USDOT awarded $45 million to start
small-scale deployment of these systems, called the CV Pilot
Deployment Program, in three sites including New York [12].
In this paper, we perform the ﬁrst security analysis of such CV-
based transportation systems as a timely study to understand
the potential security problems and challenges at the design
level before large-scale deployment.
As the ﬁrst security study on CV-based transportation sys-
tems, we target the CV-based trafﬁc control system developed
in the DMA program, called Intelligent Trafﬁc Signal System
(I-SIG) [14]. In this system, real-time vehicle trajectory data
transmitted via DSRC are leveraged to perform more effective
trafﬁc signal control in an intersection.
In the DMA program,
the development of I-SIG was
assigned by USDOT to a team of signal control experts. In
this work, we use the latest released version, MMITSS-AZ [4].
This version is fully functional in the ﬁeld, which has been
tested in real intersections in Anthem and Palo Alto and shown
high effectiveness with a 26.6% reduction in the total vehicle
delay [6]. In this section, we ﬁrst introduce some key concepts
in signal control, and then describe the I-SIG system design.
1) Trafﬁc Control Concepts: As shown in Fig. 2, the I-
SIG system is operated on an RSU located at an intersection
to control the trafﬁc signals. As shown, there are 8 trafﬁc
signals, called phases. Phases with odd numbers are for left-
turn lanes; the others are for through lanes. Each phase is
initially conﬁgured with the minimum green light lasting time,
tgmin , the maximum green light lasting time, tgmax , the yellow
light lasting time ty, and the clearance red light lasting time
tr. During the signal control, a phase can be set to turn green
and last for a duration tg. The green duration tg must be at
least tgmin and at most tgmax ; this is enforced at the hardware
level. After tg time passes, the phase will be yellow for ty, and
then red for tr before the subsequent phase turns green, which
is for safety purposes since there might be red light runners.
Signal control is performed by setting tg and the phase
sequence, which in combination called a signal plan. Fig. 3
illustrates a signal plan. Number 1 to 8 are phases, and
the green, yellow, and clearance red light periods for each
phase are ﬁlled with the corresponding colors. As shown,
this plan has two phase sequences, called rings, operating
simultaneously. The phases in the same ring is in conﬂict with
each other, and thus need to be planned sequentially. This is
called dual-ring signal phasing, which is the NEMA (National
Electrical Manufacturers Association) standard and the most
common in the U.S. [37]. For each ring, the phase sequence
is broken down to stages. Two types of stages are planned
alternatively, one for phase 1, 2, 5, and 6, and another for
phase 3, 4, 7, and 8. The phases in the former stage type are
in conﬂict with those in the latter stage type, and thus the
phases in the same stage are planned as a whole.
A signal control algorithm needs to follow the rules above,
and plan (1) tg for each phase, and (2) the sequence of phases
in the same ring and same stage, e.g., phase 1 and 2 in the
