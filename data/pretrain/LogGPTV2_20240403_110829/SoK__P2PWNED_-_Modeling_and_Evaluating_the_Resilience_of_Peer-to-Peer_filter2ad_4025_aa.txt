## Abstract:
Centralized botnets are vulnerable to takedown efforts by cybersecurity researchers and law enforcement, leading botnet operators to adopt more resilient architectures. One such approach is the use of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks, which lack a single point of failure. However, P2P botnets are susceptible to unique types of attacks, such as node enumeration and poisoning. In this paper, we introduce a formal graph-theoretical model to capture the intrinsic properties and vulnerabilities of P2P botnets. We apply our model to current P2P botnets to assess their resilience against various attacks. Our analysis includes the sizes of all eleven active P2P botnets, revealing that some families contain over a million bots. Additionally, we prototype several mitigation strategies to measure the resilience of existing P2P botnets. The results from our analysis can inform security researchers in evaluating and developing effective countermeasures against both current and future P2P botnets.

## 1. Introduction
Criminals use botnets for a variety of malicious activities, including denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, spam, and banking fraud. Traditional botnets rely on a central Command-and-Control (C&C) server, making them prime targets for takedown efforts by security researchers and law enforcement. In response, botnet operators have developed new architectures to enhance resilience. Techniques include fast-flux DNS and domain generation algorithms (DGA). A more radical and increasingly popular approach is to organize the botnet as a P2P network, where bots communicate directly with each other, eliminating the need for centralized servers. This makes P2P botnets resistant to traditional takedown methods.

Despite the long-term survival of P2P botnets like Zeus, Sality, ZeroAccess, and Kelihos, little is known about their sizes and resilience. Estimating the size of a P2P botnet is challenging due to custom protocols, encryption, and IP address churn. Additionally, there is no systematic method to analyze the resilience of P20P botnets against takedown attempts. Previous studies have identified weaknesses in specific P2P botnets, but these findings are not generalizable.

In this paper, we present a graph-theoretical model to analyze the resilience of P2P botnets. Our model captures the fundamental characteristics of P2P botnets and extends to general mitigation strategies. We focus on two aspects of resilience:
1. **Intelligence Gathering Resilience**: We model and evaluate the effectiveness of reconnaissance methods used to enumerate bots in the network.
2. **Disruption Resilience**: We formalize and test disruption attacks, such as sinkholing and partitioning, to measure the botnet's ability to withstand such attacks.

We apply our model to real-world P2P botnets, providing insights into their population sizes and resilience. Our contributions include:
1. A formal graph model for P2P botnets and a set of attack methods applicable to any P2P botnet.
2. Implementation and evaluation of intelligence gathering techniques, comparing the accuracy of crawling and sensor injection.
3. Analysis of the resilience of active P2P botnets through prototyped attacks, identifying both vulnerable and robust designs.

## 2. Overview of P2P Botnets
This section provides an overview of significant P2P botnet families that emerged between 2007 and 2012. Our analysis is based on data from the dynamic malware analysis platform SANDNET, combined with reverse engineering, takedown experiences, and technical reports from malware analysis companies. We focus on botnets that use P2P communication as their primary means, excluding those that use P2P as a backup channel, such as Conficker.C and TDL4.

### 2.1 P2P Botnet Characteristics
We analyze twelve P2P botnet variants, with four families currently active as of November 2012. Each family, except Zeus, consists of multiple major versions, and each version may include one or more disjoint botnets. Figure 1 illustrates the active P2P botnet families, their variants, and instances. Figure 2 shows the lifespans of the studied botnet variants, ranging from eight months (Miner) to five years (Sality).

Table I summarizes the communication protocol, message propagation method, communication direction, C&C architecture, and purpose of each P2P botnet. Most recent P2P botnets use unstructured protocols, relying on message gossiping for information propagation. These botnets are used for various purposes, including malware distribution, spam, credential theft, and DDoS attacks. Some botnets, like Nugache, Sality, and ZeroAccess, are purely P2P-based, while others use hybrid architectures with centralized components. However, shutting down these centralized components often has minimal impact, as the P2P layer can redirect bots to alternative servers.

| Family     | Protocol  | Propagation | Direction | C&C Architecture | Purpose                         |
|------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|------------------|---------------------------------|
| Kelihos    | Custom    | Gossip      | Pull      | Hybrid           | DDoS, Spam, Credential Theft    |
| Miner      | Custom    | Gossip      | Pull      | Hybrid           | Bitcoin Mining, Click Fraud     |
| Nugache    | Custom    | Gossip      | Pull      | P2P              | Malware Distribution            |
| Sality     | Custom    | Gossip      | Pull      | P2P              | Network Services, Credential Theft |
| Storm      | Overnet   | Routing     | Pull      | Hybrid           | DDoS, Spam, Credential Theft    |
| Waledac    | Custom    | Gossip      | Pull      | Hybrid           | DDoS, Spam, Credential Theft    |
| ZeroAccess | Custom    | Gossip      | Pull/Both | P2P              | Pay-Per-Install, DDoS           |
| Zeus       | Custom    | Gossip      | Both      | Hybrid           | Pay-Per-Install, DDoS, Spam     |
