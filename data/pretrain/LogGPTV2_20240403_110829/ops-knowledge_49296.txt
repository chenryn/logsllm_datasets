User: Try to build a simple web application using Docker container technology and deploy it to the cloud platform.
Assistant: Here's a simple list of steps to achieve building and deploying: 1. Choose a suitable web framework, such as Flask or Django, and start writing web applications. 2. Create a Dockerfile for building the Docker image. This file should contain things like which base image to start with, install required software, copy application code into a Docker container, and set container environment variables. For example: ``` FROM python:3.7-alpine WORKDIR /app COPY requirements.txt /app RUN pip install -r requirements.txt COPY . /app ENV FLASK_APP=app.py CMD ["flask", "run", "- -host=0.0.0.0"] ``` 3. Build the Docker image locally. Navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile in the terminal, and run the following command: ``` docker build -t my-web-app . ``` 4. When the build is complete, check to see if the Docker image exists: ``` docker images ``` 5. Run the web application locally using a Docker container: ``` docker run --rm -p 5000:5000 my-web-app ``` 6. Open a browser and enter http://localhost:5000 Visit to ensure that the web application is running properly locally. 7. Log in and register a cloud platform account, such as AWS or Azure. 8. Push the Docker image into the container image warehouse of the cloud platform. Login in the terminal: ``` docker login my-registry.azurecr.io ``` View the label of the Docker image: ``` docker images ``` Push the Docker image into the container image warehouse of the cloud platform: `` ` docker tag my-web-app my-registry.azurecr.io/my-web-app:v1 docker push my-registry.azurecr.io/my-web-app:v1 ``` 9. Deploy the Docker container to the cloud on the platform. Select Container Service in the cloud platform console, and use the previously pushed Docker image to create a new container instance. 10. Test the deployed web application to make sure it is accessible and functional. The above is a basic process of building and deploying web applications. Of course, more details will be involved in the actual operation process, but this process can provide us with a general guide.
