User: I'd like to find out the currently running script's file name. Usually via __file__ or __main__.__file__ or even with sys.argv[0].
But when installed as shell command with setup.py and entry_points / console_scripts, /usr/local/bin/... is returned instead of the actual file name.
My next guess was the inspect module, like inspect.stack()[1].filename. Unfortunately this was inconsistent and did not work in all cases.
Any suggestions please?
Assistant: Simply pass the full path you have now to os.path.basename to get only the filename part.
