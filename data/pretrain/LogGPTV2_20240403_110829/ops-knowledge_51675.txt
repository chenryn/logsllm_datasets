User: I haven't yet been able to get Apache working with my Django app, so until I do get it working, I'm using runserver on my Linux server in order to demo the app. The problem is that whenever I close the SSH connection to the server, runserver stops running. How can I keep runserver running when I say put my laptop to sleep, or lose internet connectivity?
P.S. I'm aware that runserver isn't intended for production.
Assistant: Since runserver isn't intended to be ran in production/only for development there is no way to to this built in.
You will need to use a tool like tmux/screen or nohup to keep the process alive, even if the spawning terminal closes.
