Before updating to Python 2.7.3, the system was running Python 2.6.6. When attempting to run `pybot --version`, an error occurred as shown below:

```
[root@localhost robotframework-2.7.6]# pybot --version
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "/usr/bin/pybot", line 4, in <module>
      from robot import run_cli

      from robot.rebot import rebot, rebot_cli

      from .compress import compress_text
    File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/robot/utils/compress.py", line 25, in <module>
      import zlib
  ImportError: No module named zlib
```

I aim to set up a test environment with the following components:
- Python 2.7.3
- Robot Framework 2.7.6
- Paramiko 1.7.4
- PyCrypto 2.6

To resolve the issue, I installed the `zlib-devel` and `python-devel` packages using `yum` and then recompiled Python. After these steps, the installation and testing were successfully completed.

Thank you for your assistance.
