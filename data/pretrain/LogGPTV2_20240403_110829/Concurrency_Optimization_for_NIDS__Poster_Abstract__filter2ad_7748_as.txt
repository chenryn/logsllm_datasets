that serum lipidome significantly improves prediction accuracy for subclinical atherosclerosis over traditional risk factors (reference model: AUC 
0762, 95% CI [0698, 0823], test model 1: AUC 0778, 95% CI [0715, 0838], t-test p-value: 22e-16) Serum lipidome also showed independent 
predictive accuracy equivalent to that of traditional risk factors [test model 2: AUC 0762, 95%CI [0698, 0821], t-test p-value against reference 
model: 05005] Conclusion: This study indicates that serum lipidome may help in predicting subclinical atherosclerosis for primary prevention more 
effectively than traditional risk factors alone

In the past few years, the gut microbiome has been shown to play an important role in various disorders including in particular cardiovascular 
diseases Especially the metabolite trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), which is produced by gut microbial metabolism, has repeatedly been 
associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events Here we report a fast liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/
MS) method that can analyze the five most important gut metabolites with regards to TMAO in three minutes Fast liquid chromatography is 
unconventionally used in this method as an on-line cleanup step to remove the most important ion suppressors leaving the gut metabolites in a 
cleaned flow through fraction We compared different bloodmatrix types to recommend best sampling practices and found citrated plasma samples 
generally demonstrated lower concentrations and choline concentrations were significantly higher in serum samples We demonstrated the 
applicability of our method by investigating the effect of a standardized liquid meal (SLM) after overnight fasting of 25 healthy individuals on the gut 
metabolite levels Volunteers with increased and decreased gut metabolite serum levels could be identified, which could have been driven by the 
gender of the volunteers

Non-targeted metabolomics approach to elucidate metabolism alteration in mice hearts with cardiac-specific Retinoid X 
Receptor deletion
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Francisco Rupérez, Universidad San Pablo-CEU, Spain
CO-AUTHORS: Viviane Aparecida Rodrigues Sant’Anna, Ana Paredes, Miguel Fernández-García, Mercedes Ricote, Coral Barbas
The nuclear receptor Retinoid X Receptor (RXRs) is a family of ligand-dependent transcription factors that play essential role in heart development 
Whereas the systemic RXRα deletion causes embryonic lethality due to cardiac defects, the functional contribution of RXRs to cardiac metabolism 
remains unknown To explore such contribution, cardiac-specific RXRs deletion was induced, and the differences on adults and neonate mice hearts 
metabolism, were evaluated compared to wild-type mice using a non-targeted metabolomics approach with GC-MS and LC-MS Frozen pieces 
of adult hearts, and the whole newborn organ (5 mg in average) where homogenized, and from the same homogenate aliquots were processed 
in parallel for GC-MS(Q) and LC-MS(qTOF) analysis Raw data from by GC-MS were deconvoluted, aligned and integrated, and metabolites were 
annotated by comparison of fragmentation spectra with databases For LC-MS data, molecular recursive feature extraction was performed for 
ion grouping and signal multialignment Data matrices were exported for filtration, normalization, scaling and further univariate and multivariate 
(unsupervised and supervised) statistical analysis In the case of LC-MS data, only relevant compounds were putatively annotated using CEU Mass 
Mediator (http://ceumassepsuspceues/) Results proved that there was a neat difference in the metabolic profile (amino acids, sugars, and lipids) 
between adults and newborns Moreover, the different genotypes were strongly associated to the difference in the lipid profile, both in adults and 
newborns Differences in the amino acid and central carbon metabolism between adults could be found, but in the newborn mice the profiles were 
similar in both genotypes

Underlying molecular mechanisms for sex differences in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases are poorly understood In addition to hormonal 
influences, recent findings point to intrinsic sexual dimorphisms at the cellular level To analyze sex differences in cellular responses to stress, we 
used male and female human endothelial cells from umbilical cords (HUVECs) from twin pairs Previously, we had observed a greater ability of 
female HUVEC cells to form capillary-like structures compared to male cells To investigate this further, a gas chromatography mass spectrometry 
(GC-MS) targeted approach was adopted to analyze HUVEC cells raised in different conditions We focused on key metabolites associated with the 
central carbon metabolism (CCM) Untreated male HUVECs had a tendency towards slightly higher CCM pools compared to females In contrast, 
female cells had altered levels of metabolite pools after serum starvation and VEGF suggesting better stress adaptation Combined with our 
earlier findings of increased intracellular ATP levels and higher VEGF- induced migration in female cells, this suggests a higher or more efficient 
metabolic activity This is further supported by a higher cell viability of female cells under serum starvation We propose that female cells have an 
energetic advantage over male cells under conditions of diminished nutrient supply resulting in a superior ability to cope with nutritional stress and 
leading to an improvement in translating the VEGF signals into migration This could have clinical implications for the treatment and prognosis of 
cardiovascular and other diseases

Identification of biomarkers in Attention Deficit Disorder with or without Hyperactivity (ADHD)
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Patrick Emond, University of Tours, France
CO-AUTHORS: Camille Dupuy, Patrick Emond, Antoine Lefevre, Sylvie Mavel, Sylvie Bodard, Pierre Castelnau, Laurent Galineau
Attention Deficit Disorder Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a heterogeneous neuro-developmental disorder affecting 3-5% of school children and 
characterized by attention deficit, hyperactivity and impulsivity Currently the diagnosis is made mainly using cognitive tests with a significant risk 
of diagnostic errors Nowadays, no study has found reliable biomarker(s) for ADHD The identification of biomarkers thus remains an important 
challenge for early diagnosis and appropriate therapeutic follow-up of patients Associated with the search for circulating biomarkers, the study 
of central metabolism is crucial to better understand the pathophysiology of ADHD As such, the use of animal models is relevant for studying the 
cerebral metabolome The best characterized and most used rat model is the SHR / NCrl strain compared to the control strain WKY / NHsd The 
objective of this study is to identify metabolic biomarkers, centrally and peripherally, in SHR / NCrl rats For this, ten brain regions were taken, as well 
as peripheral samples (blood, urine and faeces), then analyzed in LC-HRMS The data obtained were processed by multivariate, univariate analyzes 
and the discriminating metabolic pathways were searched This study shows a discrimination between the two strains based on their metabolism 
The metabolic pathway analysis makes it possible to differentiate two functional networks: the limbic ventral network and the cognitive dorsal 
network In addition, the statistically significant alteration of common metabolic pathways is found in brain regions and peripheral compartments 
Metabolomics studies on clinical peripheral samples will be carried out to better characterise this severe and frequent disorder

Effect of ASIC3 on metabolomics in serum and urine of fibromyalgia mice
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Wei-Hsiang Hsu, China Medical University, Taiwan
CO-AUTHORS: Cheng-Han Lee, Yen-Ming Chao, Chih-Cheng Chen, Yun-Lian Lin
Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic widespread pain The pathogenesis of FM is unclear No specific biomarkers are available Therefore, an animal 
models of FM may provide an opportunity to explore the potential biomarkers in a relative homogenous disease condition Here, we probed the 
metabolomics in an intermittent cold stress (ICS)-induced FM mouse model and focused on the role of acid-sensing ion channel 3 (ASIC3), because 
ICS treatment induced chronic widespread muscle pain lasting for a month in wild-type (Asic3+/+) mice, but not in Asic3 knockout (Asic3-/-) mice 
Serum and urine samples were collected from both genotypes in different ICS stages, including before ICS (basal level, P0), and post-ICS at days 10 
(middle phase, P10), and 40 (recovery phase, P40) 1H-NMR- and LC-MS-based metabolomics showed significant difference between control groups 
and ICS-induced FM groups Pathway analysis demonstrated that leading regulated pathways in mice were taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, 
cysteine and methionine metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and ascorbate and aldarate metabolism Further, an algorithm was 
developed for the most impact biomarkers in the FM model They were cis-aconitate, kynurenate, taurine, pyroglutamic acid, pyrrolidonecarboxylic 
acid, and 4-methoxyphenylacetic acid in urine, as well as carnitine, deoxycholic acid, lysoPC (16:0), lysoPC (20:3), oleoyl-L-carnitine, and 
trimethylamine N-oxide in serum Taken together, these results may serve as potential biomarkers for ASIC3-dependent FM diagnostic or 
therapeutic targets

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a disease characterized by progressive paralysis and death Most ALS cases are sporadic (sALS) and patient 
heterogeneity poses a formidable challenge for developing viable biomarkers and effective therapies Applying untargeted metabolite profiling 
on 77 sALS-derived primary dermal fibroblast lines and 45 sex/age matched controls, we found a class of ~25% lines (sALS-1) were characterized 
by upregulated trans-sulfuration pathway, where methionine-derived homocysteine is channeled to cysteine and glutathione synthesis sALS-1 
fibroblasts exhibit a distinct growth defect in oxidative conditions, which is fully rescued by N-acetylcysteine [U-13C]-glucose tracing shows that 
activation of the trans-sulfuration pathway is associated with accelerated glucose flux into the TCA cycle Based on four metabolites, we developed 
a support vector machine model capable of distinguishing sALS-1 with 975% accuracy Importantly, plasma metabolite profiling identifies a systemic 
perturbation of cysteine metabolism as a hallmark of sALS-1 These results indicate that sALS patients can be stratified into distinct metabotypes, 
differently sensitive to metabolic stress, and provide new insights into metabolic biomarkers and personalized therapies for sALS

PRESENTING AUTHOR: Ferenc Tömösi, University of Szeged Department of Medical Chemistry, Hungary
CO-AUTHORS: Gábor Kecskeméti, Edina Cseh, Elza Szabó, Cecília Rajda, László Vécsei, Tamás Janáky
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is disabling autoimmune, inflammatory neurodegenerative demyelinating disease affecting the central nervous system 
Approximately 23 million patients with MS live in the world Although some changes in tryptophan metabolite profile were associated with MS, 
we decided to investigate a wider range of metabolites in order to find biomarker(s) for early diagnosis of the disease A short UPLC-tandem mass 
spectrometry method was developed for targeted analysis of twelve most important tryptophan metabolites (serotonin - SERO, kynurenine - 
KYN, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid - 3-HANA, tryptophan - TRP, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid - 5-HIAA, anthranilic acid - ANA, kynurenic acid - KYNA, 
3-hydroxykynurenine - 3-HK, xanthurenic acid - XA, melatonin - MELA, picolinic acid - PICA and quinolinic acid - QUIN) in human cerebrospinal 
fluid To achieve absolute quantification stable isotope-labeled internal standards (d4-SERO, d4-KYN, d3-3-HANA, d5-TRP, d5-5-HIAA, d5-KYNA, 
d3-3-HK, d4-XA, d4-MELA, d4-PICA and d3-QUIN) were used Three metabolites were analysed in derivatized form (3-HK, PICA and QUIN) together 
with nine underivatized ones Following the official guidelines, a validation process was carried out to determine the intra- and inter-day precision 
and accuracy, to confirm the robustness and sensitivity of the developed method Compared to the control group a dramatic increase of QUIN and 
decrease of KYNA concentration was observed in the MS group, resulting in a significant rising of QUIN/KYNA ratio A significant increase in the 
KYN/TRP ratio was observed in MS patients, too These results are in harmony with changes detected in human plasma

Modafinil is a wake-promoting drug that has been used for the treatment of excessive sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy There are several 
suggested hypotheses of Modafinil mechanism but most probably one is binding of Modafinil to the dopamine transporter (DAT) However, 
specificity of Modafinil for DAT is limited as it also binds to the serotonin and noradrenaline transporters Recently, we synthetized a novel Modafinil 
analogue CE-123 with higher specificity for the DAT and tested its pharmacokinetic properties on aged rats and its metabolism in liver cancer 
cell lines (HepG2 and HepaRG) Plasma samples from aged rats were taken 2,5 hours after administration of 10 mg/kg CE-123 via intraperitoneal 
injection In order to determine the concentration of CE-123, a LC-HRMS method was developed and validated applying Modafinil as internal 
standard LOD and LOQ were found to be 2 and 6 ng/mL, respectively The analyte concentrations were in a range of 12-41 µg/mL with a mean of 
31 µg/mL (%CV = 320) In our previous study on young rats plasma concentrations after 1 hour of administration of 10 mg/kg CE-123 were 23 ± 10 
µg/mL The higher concentrations of CE-123 in aged rats could be because of slower metabolism of aged animals Biotransformation of CE-123 was 
observed in HepG2 and HepaRG cell lines After 24 h incubation of HepG2 and HepaRG with CE-123 concentration of analyte decreased for 14% 
and 3,6%, respectively An accurate and precise validated analytical method was developed enabling to observe pharmacokinetic properties and 
biotransformation of novel Modafinil analouges

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental disorder that often develops after traumatic experience It is a serious neuropsychiatric disorder 
characterized with impairments in feeling, thinking, sleeping and normal functioning Molecular and biological basis of PTSD development and 
progression is still unclear The aim of this study was to determine metabolites as possible biomarkers that differ between PTSD subjects and 
healthy controls LC-MS (Q-TOF) was used for the analysis of the plasma samples of patients enrolled in this study (50 PTSD subjects and 50 healthy 
controls) in an untargeted analysis Sample preparation included protein precipitation with cold methanol : ethanol (1:1) Prepared samples were 
injected randomly with injection volume set to 10 µL at temperature of 4ºC, while flow was set up at 06 mL/min The analysis were performed in 
positive and negative ionization The chromatograms were processed and tandem mass spectrometry was performed for compounds statistically 
significant (p<005) in order to identify them Compounds that were tentatively annotated or identified according to the MS / MS analysis mostly 
belong to the compound group of glycerophospholipids, with glycerophosphocholines as the most common class among glycerophospholipids 
Altered levels of glycerophospholipids indicate increased inflammation and impairments associated with cell membrane Posttraumatic stress 
disorder is a complex anxiety disorder that affects the whole organism, therefore future studies are necessary to determine possible biomarkers or 
metabolic pathways associated with PTSD In order to validate the compounds obtained in this study, the next step will include targeted analysis on 
a larger number of samples

The metabolome is the set of all metabolites present in a cell, tissue or body fluid in a given time point It comprises all substrates and end 
products in the biochemical networks in our body and as it is the closest omics layer to phenotype, it is directly affected by any pathophysiological 
changes As such, the metabolome is an excellent compartment to study diversions from the normal state We have measured the metabolome 
of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients in different stages of multiple sclerosis and Huntington’s disease as well as in control individuals Both 
disease metabolomes were significantly different from the metabolome of control individuals, with area under the receiver operating characteristic 
(AUROC) curves of 079(±021) and 072(±014) for multiple sclerosis and Huntington’s disease respectively, and demonstrated significant differences 
between disease stages (AUROC values of 083(±015) and 076(±017), respectively) Inter-group comparisons revealed multiple biochemical 
pathways that were being altered, including the tyrosine metabolism in Huntington’s disease, and the tryptophan metabolism and pantothenate 
and CoA biosynthesis in multiple sclerosis In common, the phenylalanine and the nitrogen metabolism were altered in both multiple sclerosis and 
Huntington’s disease Metabolomics is still a maturing field, which we believe has the potential of developing into something clinically useful In 
this study, the metabolic signature of CSF was able to distinguish two neurological diseases from normal state as well as demonstrated differences 
between stages of the diseases

First-episode psychotic patients who gain weight in follow-up have increased markers of non-alcoholic fatty liver  
disease at baseline
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Matej Oresic, Örebro University, Sweden

Schizophrenia is associated with a life expectancy reduction of 15-20 years, mostly due to the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease, type 
2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome Identification of psychotic individuals who are at highest risk of rapid weight gain and the associated 
development of metabolic co-morbidities is therefore a major challenge for public health We have previously shown in a first-episode psychosis 
(FEP) prospective study in Uusimaa district in Finland (1) that those FEP patients who rapidly gained weight, had increased circulating lipids 
that were previously reported as biomarkers of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (2) Here we applied lipidomics in a prospective study 
comprising 48 controls, 44 FEP patients and 22 individuals at clinical-high-risk (CHR) for psychosis, from two study centres (Turku/Finland and 
London/UK) Lipidomics (UHPLC-MS) was applied in baseline serum samples, while body mass index (BMI) was assessed at baseline and after 12 
months Similarly as in previous study (1), we found that FEP patients who gained weight had at baseline, independent of obesity, significant increase 
of triacylglycerols with low double bond count and carbon number, as well as decreased phospholipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids Our 
study thus confirms that lipidomic signature of NAFLD at baseline, independent of obesity, may serve as a predictor of weight gain and may thus 
provide a useful marker for identifying patients who are most vulnerable to the development of metabolic co-morbidities in psychosis

The metabolic co-morbidities in psychosis are well recognised The underlying mechanisms for these metabolic changes remain unclear Here 
we studied the circulating lipid profiles in 4 independent psychosis cohorts and controls Two of the cohorts were from Finland (Turku and THL), 
one cohort from London (KCL) and one from Spain (SERMAS) Our aim was to identify changes in lipids in first episode psychosis (FEP) individuals 
compared to the controls The lipids were detected using a UHPLC-QTOF (Agilent 6540) profiling method The concentrations of the lipids were 
calculated using class based internal standards and standard curves The Turku and KCL samples were run in the same batch and used as a 
discovery cohort (n=57) The THL (n=38) and SERMAS (n=130) were used as independent validation cohorts The lipid profiles showed a clear effect 
of site between the Turku and KCL groups The Gaussian clusters revealed that the main lipids driving this separation were triglycerides suggesting 
a diet effect in these two populations There was also a significant effect of gender in the lipid clusters and therefore, we decided to model the 
genders separately In the male FEP patients 4 lipids were identified by univariate and multivariate analysis The 4 lipids were PC (40:5), PC(40:4), 
PC(32:1), PC(38:6) and all decreased in concentration in FEP Meta-analysis across all 4 cohorts reveal that these lipids are regulated similarly across 
the cohorts These lipid species identified by this study can demonstrate a unique lipid signature for the onset of FEP in a multi-centre setting

Sphingolipids are major constituents in eukaryotic cell membrane and play many key roles in cellular regulation processes, which is also involved 
in pathophysiological mechanism of many diseases Increasing evidence has shown that the sphingolipids involved in the development of ischemic 
stroke and the sphingolipid pathway may act as the potential therapeutic targets To provide accurate sphingolipid quantification results, we have 
optimized the sample extraction protocol and the ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography - electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry 
(UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS) analytical method To investigate the prognostic roles of ceramide in patients with acute ischemic stroke, we collected 
plasma samples from acute ischemic stroke patients at 24 hr and 72 hr post stroke (n=95; poor prognosis: 46%) and non-stroke controls (n=55) 
Plasma samples were measured by the optimized UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS method The post-stroke outcome was determined by the modified Rankin 
Scale (mRS), and mRS  2 at 3 months post stroke was defined as a good outcome The preliminary results show that the levels of sphingosine-
1-phosphate in patients significantly decrease compared to the control group The comparison of ceramides with different acyl chains between 
patients with different outcomes at 72 hours revealed a significant increase of long-chain ceramide levels, C16, C18, C20, and C22 in patients with 
poor prognosis These results suggest long chain ceramides represented as potential prognostic markers for patients with acute ischemic stroke 
The biological mechanism of long chain ceramides in ischemic stroke deserves further investigation to elucidate their role as the therapeutic target
