**Presenting Author:** Tom van der Laan, Leiden University, Netherlands  
**Co-Authors:** Tom van der Laan, Tim Kloots, Marian Beekman, Alida Kindt, Anne-Charlotte Dubbelman, Amy Harms, Cornelia van Duijn, Eline Slagboom, Thomas Hankemeier

**Abstract:**
- **Background:** The gut microbiome has been shown to play a significant role in various disorders, particularly cardiovascular diseases. Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a metabolite produced by gut microbial metabolism, is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events.
- **Method:** We developed a fast liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method to analyze five key gut metabolites related to TMAO within three minutes. Fast liquid chromatography was used as an online cleanup step to remove major ion suppressors, leaving the gut metabolites in a cleaned flow-through fraction.
- **Sampling Comparison:** Different blood matrix types were compared to determine best sampling practices. Citrated plasma samples generally showed lower concentrations, while choline concentrations were significantly higher in serum samples.
- **Application:** The method's applicability was demonstrated by investigating the effect of a standardized liquid meal (SLM) after overnight fasting on gut metabolite levels in 25 healthy individuals. Volunteers with increased and decreased gut metabolite serum levels were identified, which may be influenced by gender.

### Non-Targeted Metabolomics Approach to Elucidate Metabolic Alterations in Mice Hearts with Cardiac-Specific Retinoid X Receptor Deletion

**Presenting Author:** Francisco Rupérez, Universidad San Pablo-CEU, Spain  
**Co-Authors:** Viviane Aparecida Rodrigues Sant’Anna, Ana Paredes, Miguel Fernández-García, Mercedes Ricote, Coral Barbas

**Abstract:**
- **Background:** Retinoid X Receptors (RXRs) are ligand-dependent transcription factors essential for heart development. Systemic RXRα deletion causes embryonic lethality due to cardiac defects, but the functional contribution of RXRs to cardiac metabolism remains unknown.
- **Method:** Cardiac-specific RXR deletion was induced in mice, and metabolic differences between adult and neonatal hearts were evaluated using non-targeted metabolomics with GC-MS and LC-MS.
- **Sample Preparation:** Frozen pieces of adult hearts and whole newborn hearts (average 5 mg) were homogenized. Aliquots from the same homogenate were processed in parallel for GC-MS(Q) and LC-MS(qTOF) analysis.
- **Data Analysis:** GC-MS data were deconvoluted, aligned, and integrated, and metabolites were annotated by comparing fragmentation spectra with databases. For LC-MS data, molecular recursive feature extraction was performed for ion grouping and signal multialignment. Data matrices were exported for filtration, normalization, scaling, and statistical analysis.
- **Results:** There was a clear difference in the metabolic profile (amino acids, sugars, and lipids) between adults and newborns. Genotypes were strongly associated with differences in the lipid profile in both age groups. Differences in amino acid and central carbon metabolism were found in adults, but not in newborns.

**Presenting Author:** Raphaela Fritsche, Berlin Institute of Health Metabolomics Platform and Max-Delbrück-Center for Molecular Medicine, Germany  
**Co-Authors:** Yoann Gloaguen, Cornelia Bartsch, Angelika Vietzke, Verena Stangl, Mario Lorenz, Jennifer Kirwan

**Abstract:**
- **Background:** The underlying molecular mechanisms for sex differences in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases are poorly understood. In addition to hormonal influences, recent findings suggest intrinsic sexual dimorphisms at the cellular level.
- **Method:** Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) from twin pairs were used to analyze sex differences in cellular responses to stress. A gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) targeted approach was adopted to analyze HUVEC cells under different conditions, focusing on key metabolites associated with central carbon metabolism (CCM).
- **Results:** Untreated male HUVECs had slightly higher CCM pools compared to females. Female cells showed altered levels of metabolite pools after serum starvation and VEGF, suggesting better stress adaptation. Combined with earlier findings of increased intracellular ATP levels and higher VEGF-induced migration in female cells, this suggests a higher or more efficient metabolic activity. Female cells also had higher cell viability under serum starvation.
- **Conclusion:** Female cells have an energetic advantage over male cells under conditions of diminished nutrient supply, leading to a superior ability to cope with nutritional stress and translating VEGF signals into migration. This could have clinical implications for the treatment and prognosis of cardiovascular and other diseases.

**Presenting Author:** Patrick Emond, University of Tours, France  
**Co-Authors:** Camille Dupuy, Patrick Emond, Antoine Lefevre, Sylvie Mavel, Sylvie Bodard, Pierre Castelnau, Laurent Galineau

**Abstract:**
- **Background:** Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder affecting 3-5% of school children, characterized by attention deficit, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Current diagnosis relies mainly on cognitive tests, with a significant risk of diagnostic errors. No reliable biomarkers for ADHD have been identified.
- **Objective:** To identify metabolic biomarkers centrally and peripherally in the SHR/NCrl rat model of ADHD.
- **Method:** Ten brain regions and peripheral samples (blood, urine, and feces) were analyzed using LC-HRMS. Data were processed by multivariate and univariate analyses to identify discriminating metabolic pathways.
- **Results:** A discrimination between the two strains based on their metabolism was observed. The metabolic pathway analysis revealed two functional networks: the limbic ventral network and the cognitive dorsal network. Statistically significant alterations in common metabolic pathways were found in both brain regions and peripheral compartments.
- **Conclusion:** Metabolomics studies on clinical peripheral samples will be conducted to better characterize this severe and frequent disorder.

### Effect of ASIC3 on Metabolomics in Serum and Urine of Fibromyalgia Mice

**Presenting Author:** Wei-Hsiang Hsu, China Medical University, Taiwan  
**Co-Authors:** Cheng-Han Lee, Yen-Ming Chao, Chih-Cheng Chen, Yun-Lian Lin

**Abstract:**
- **Background:** Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic widespread pain condition with an unclear pathogenesis and no specific biomarkers. An animal model of FM induced by intermittent cold stress (ICS) was used to explore potential biomarkers.
- **Method:** Serum and urine samples were collected from wild-type (Asic3+/+) and Asic3 knockout (Asic3-/-) mice at different ICS stages: before ICS (P0), middle phase (P10), and recovery phase (P40). 1H-NMR- and LC-MS-based metabolomics were used to analyze the samples.
- **Results:** Significant differences were observed between control and ICS-induced FM groups. Leading regulated pathways included taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and ascorbate and aldarate metabolism. Potential biomarkers in urine included cis-aconitate, kynurenate, taurine, pyroglutamic acid, pyrrolidonecarboxylic acid, and 4-methoxyphenylacetic acid. In serum, potential biomarkers included carnitine, deoxycholic acid, lysoPC (16:0), lysoPC (20:3), oleoyl-L-carnitine, and trimethylamine N-oxide.
- **Conclusion:** These results may serve as potential biomarkers for ASIC3-dependent FM diagnostic or therapeutic targets.

**Presenting Author:** Qiuying Chen  
**Co-Authors:** Davinder Sandhu, Csaba Konrad, Dipa Roychoudhury, Benjamin I. Schwartz, Roger R. Cheng, Kirsten Bredvik, Hibiki Kawamata, Elizabeth L. Calder, Lorenz Studer, Steven M. Fischer, Giovanni Manfredi

**Abstract:**
- **Background:** Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive paralytic disease, with most cases being sporadic (sALS). Patient heterogeneity poses a challenge for developing biomarkers and effective therapies.
- **Method:** Untargeted metabolite profiling was applied to 77 sALS-derived primary dermal fibroblast lines and 45 sex/age-matched controls. A class of ~25% lines (sALS-1) was characterized by upregulated trans-sulfuration, where methionine-derived homocysteine is channeled to cysteine and glutathione synthesis.
- **Results:** sALS-1 fibroblasts exhibited a distinct growth defect in oxidative conditions, fully rescued by N-acetylcysteine. [U-13C]-glucose tracing showed accelerated glucose flux into the TCA cycle. A support vector machine model was developed to distinguish sALS-1 with 97.5% accuracy. Plasma metabolite profiling identified a systemic perturbation of cysteine metabolism as a hallmark of sALS-1.
- **Conclusion:** sALS patients can be stratified into distinct metabotypes, differently sensitive to metabolic stress, providing new insights into metabolic biomarkers and personalized therapies for sALS.

**Presenting Author:** Ferenc Tömösi, University of Szeged Department of Medical Chemistry, Hungary  
**Co-Authors:** Gábor Kecskeméti, Edina Cseh, Elza Szabó, Cecília Rajda, László Vécsei, Tamás Janáky

**Abstract:**
- **Background:** Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disabling autoimmune, inflammatory, neurodegenerative demyelinating disease affecting the central nervous system. Some changes in tryptophan metabolite profiles have been associated with MS.
- **Method:** A UPLC-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed for targeted analysis of twelve important tryptophan metabolites in human cerebrospinal fluid. Stable isotope-labeled internal standards were used for absolute quantification.
- **Results:** Compared to the control group, a dramatic increase in quinolinic acid (QUIN) and a decrease in kynurenic acid (KYNA) concentration were observed in the MS group, resulting in a significant rise in the QUIN/KYNA ratio. A significant increase in the kynurenine (KYN)/tryptophan (TRP) ratio was also observed in MS patients.
- **Conclusion:** These results are consistent with changes detected in human plasma and provide potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of MS.

### Pharmacokinetic Studies and In-Vitro Metabolism in HepG2 and HepaRG Cell Lines of Novel Modafinil Analogue CE-123 by LC-HRMS

**Presenting Author:** Iva Cobankovic, University of Vienna, Austria  
**Co-Authors:** Iva Cobankovic, Judith Wackerlig, Eva Maria Franschitz, Verena Johler, Carina Müller, Predrag Kalaba, Gyertyán István, Gábor Brenner, Ernst Urban, Thierry Langer, Gert Lubec

**Abstract:**
- **Background:** Modafinil is a wake-promoting drug used for treating excessive sleepiness in narcolepsy. It binds to the dopamine transporter (DAT) but also to serotonin and noradrenaline transporters. A novel modafinil analogue, CE-123, with higher specificity for DAT, was synthesized.
- **Method:** Pharmacokinetic properties of CE-123 were tested in aged rats, and its metabolism was studied in liver cancer cell lines (HepG2 and HepaRG). Plasma samples from aged rats were taken 2.5 hours after administration of 10 mg/kg CE-123 via intraperitoneal injection. A validated LC-HRMS method was developed using modafinil as an internal standard.
- **Results:** Analyte concentrations in plasma were in the range of 1.2-4.1 µg/mL with a mean of 3.1 µg/mL (%CV = 3.20). In previous studies on young rats, plasma concentrations after 1 hour of administration of 10 mg/kg CE-123 were 2.3 ± 1.0 µg/mL. Higher concentrations in aged rats suggest slower metabolism. Biotransformation of CE-123 was observed in HepG2 and HepaRG cell lines, with a 14% and 3.6% decrease in analyte concentration after 24 hours, respectively.
- **Conclusion:** An accurate and precise analytical method was developed to observe the pharmacokinetic properties and biotransformation of novel modafinil analogues.

### LC-MS Untargeted Analysis in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder

**Presenting Author:** Marcela Konjevod, Rudjer Boskovic Institute, Division of Molecular Medicine, Laboratory of Molecular Neuropsychiatry, Croatia  
**Co-Authors:** Jorge Saiz, Matea Nikolac Perkovic, Gordana Nedic Erjavec, Dubravka Svob Strac, Lucija Tudor, Neven Zarkovic, Coral Barbas, Nela Pivac

**Abstract:**
- **Background:** Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by impairments in feeling, thinking, sleeping, and normal functioning. The molecular and biological basis of PTSD development and progression is still unclear.
- **Method:** LC-MS (Q-TOF) was used for untargeted analysis of plasma samples from 50 PTSD subjects and 50 healthy controls. Sample preparation included protein precipitation with cold methanol:ethanol (1:1). Samples were injected randomly with a 10 µL injection volume at 4°C, and the flow rate was set to 0.6 mL/min. Data were processed, and tandem mass spectrometry was performed for statistically significant compounds (p<0.05).
- **Results:** Compounds tentatively annotated or identified mostly belonged to the glycerophospholipid group, with glycerophosphocholines being the most common. Altered levels of glycerophospholipids indicate increased inflammation and impairments associated with cell membranes.
- **Conclusion:** Future studies are necessary to determine possible biomarkers or metabolic pathways associated with PTSD. Targeted analysis on a larger number of samples will be the next step to validate the compounds obtained in this study.

### Clinical Metabolomics - Similarities and Differences Between Multiple Sclerosis and Huntington’s Disease

**Presenting Author:** Stephanie Herman, Uppsala University, Sweden  
**Co-Authors:** Payam Emami Khoonsari, Valter Niemelä, Torbjörn Åkerfeldt, Ola Spjuth, Joachim Burman, Kim Kultima

**Abstract:**
- **Background:** The metabolome, comprising all substrates and end products in biochemical networks, is an excellent compartment to study diversions from the normal state. We measured the metabolome of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients in different stages of multiple sclerosis and Huntington’s disease, as well as in control individuals.
- **Method:** Both disease metabolomes were significantly different from the metabolome of control individuals, with area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves of 0.79(±0.21) and 0.72(±0.14) for multiple sclerosis and Huntington’s disease, respectively. Inter-group comparisons revealed multiple altered biochemical pathways, including tyrosine metabolism in Huntington’s disease and tryptophan metabolism and pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis in multiple sclerosis. Phenylalanine and nitrogen metabolism were altered in both diseases.
- **Conclusion:** Metabolomics has the potential to develop into a clinically useful tool. In this study, the metabolic signature of CSF was able to distinguish two neurological diseases from the normal state and demonstrated differences between disease stages.

### First-Episode Psychotic Patients Who Gain Weight in Follow-Up Have Increased Markers of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease at Baseline

**Presenting Author:** Matej Oresic, Örebro University, Sweden  
**Co-Authors:** Santosh Lamichhane, Alex Dickens, Cecilia Carlsson, Jaana Suvisaari, Oliver Howes, Jarmo Hietala, Tuulia Hyötyläinen

**Abstract:**
- **Background:** Schizophrenia is associated with a life expectancy reduction of 15-20 years, primarily due to high prevalence of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Identifying psychotic individuals at highest risk of rapid weight gain and associated metabolic co-morbidities is a major public health challenge.
- **Method:** We previously showed in a first-episode psychosis (FEP) prospective study in Finland that FEP patients who rapidly gained weight had increased circulating lipids, previously reported as biomarkers of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Here, we applied lipidomics in a prospective study comprising 48 controls, 44 FEP patients, and 22 individuals at clinical-high-risk (CHR) for psychosis from two study centers (Turku/Finland and London/UK).
- **Results:** FEP patients who gained weight had, at baseline, independent of obesity, significant increases in triacylglycerols with low double bond count and carbon number, and decreases in phospholipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids. Our study confirms that a lipidomic signature of NAFLD at baseline, independent of obesity, may serve as a predictor of weight gain and a marker for identifying patients vulnerable to metabolic co-morbidities in psychosis.
- **Conclusion:** Lipidomic signatures can help identify FEP patients at risk of rapid weight gain and associated metabolic complications.

**Presenting Author:** Alex Dickens, University of Turku, Finland  
**Co-Authors:** Santosh Lamichhane, Laurikainen H, Borgan F, Suvisaari J, Howes O, Hietala J, Hyötyläinen T, Matej Orešič

**Abstract:**
- **Background:** Metabolic co-morbidities in psychosis are well recognized, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We studied circulating lipid profiles in four independent psychosis cohorts and controls.
- **Method:** Two cohorts were from Finland (Turku and THL), one from London (KCL), and one from Spain (SERMAS). The aim was to identify changes in lipids in first episode psychosis (FEP) individuals compared to controls. Lipids were detected using a UHPLC-QTOF (Agilent 6540) profiling method, and concentrations were calculated using class-based internal standards and standard curves.
- **Results:** The lipid profiles showed a clear effect of site between the Turku and KCL groups, with triglycerides driving the separation, suggesting a diet effect. There was also a significant effect of gender. In male FEP patients, four lipids (PC(40:5), PC(40:4), PC(32:1), PC(38:6)) were identified by univariate and multivariate analysis, all of which decreased in concentration in FEP. Meta-analysis across all four cohorts revealed that these lipids are regulated similarly.
- **Conclusion:** These lipid species can demonstrate a unique lipid signature for the onset of FEP in a multi-center setting.

### Analysis of Ceramides and Sphingosine 1 Phosphate in Ischemic Stroke Patients Using Ultra-High-Pressure Liquid Chromatography - Electrospray Ionization Tandem Mass Spectrometry

**Presenting Author:** Tsung-Heng Lee, School of Pharmacy, National Taiwan University, Taiwan  
**Co-Authors:** Sung-Chun Tang, Hsi-Chun Chao, Ching-Hua Lee, Ching-Hua Kuo

**Abstract:**
- **Background:** Sphingolipids are major constituents of eukaryotic cell membranes and play key roles in cellular regulation processes, including the pathophysiological mechanisms of ischemic stroke.
- **Method:** We optimized the sample extraction protocol and the ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography - electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS) analytical method to provide accurate sphingolipid quantification. Plasma samples were collected from acute ischemic stroke patients at 24 and 72 hours post-stroke (n=95; poor prognosis: 46%) and non-stroke controls (n=55). The post-stroke outcome was determined by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), with mRS ≤ 2 at 3 months post-stroke defined as a good outcome.
- **Results:** Preliminary results show that sphingosine-1-phosphate levels in patients significantly decreased compared to the control group. Comparison of ceramides with different acyl chains between patients with different outcomes at 72 hours revealed a significant increase in long-chain ceramide levels (C16, C18, C20, and C22) in patients with poor prognosis.
- **Conclusion:** Long-chain ceramides represent potential prognostic markers for patients with acute ischemic stroke. Further investigation is needed to elucidate their role as therapeutic targets.
