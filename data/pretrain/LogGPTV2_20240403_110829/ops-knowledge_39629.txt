User: How to automate the management of EC2 instances on the AWS cloud using Python scripts?
Assistant: To automate the management of EC2 instances on the AWS cloud using Python scripts, you need to use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) and the AWS CLI. Here are some steps: 1. Install AWS CLI and Boto3 To install AWS CLI, use the following command: pip install awscli To install Boto3, use the following command; pip install boto3 2. Configure AWS CLI In terminal, run aws configure command And enter the AWS access key ID, AWS access key, and AWS default region and other information. 3. Use the Python script a. First, you need to import the boto3 library: import boto3 b. Create an EC2 client: ec2 = boto3.client('ec2') c. You can list all EC2 instances with the following command: response = ec2 .describe_instances() for reservation in response["Reservations"]: for instance in reservation["Instances"]: print(instance["InstanceId"]) d. Start instance: response = ec2.start_instances(InstanceIds=['InstanceId' ]) e. Stop the instance: response = ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=['InstanceId']) f. Create an EC2 instance: response = ec2.run_instances( ImageId='ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0', InstanceType='t2.micro', KeyName ='my-key-pair', MinCount=1, MaxCount=1 ) Among them, ImageId is the AMI ID, InstanceType is the instance type, KeyName is the name of the EC2 key pair, MinCount and MaxCount are the number of instances. g. Delete instance: response = ec2.terminate_instances(InstanceIds=['InstanceId']) 4. Use Shell script and timer to automatically execute Python script You can write a Shell script to automatically execute Python script and add it to the crontab timer middle. By using Python scripts and AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) and AWS CLI, you can easily manage EC2 instances on the AWS cloud.
