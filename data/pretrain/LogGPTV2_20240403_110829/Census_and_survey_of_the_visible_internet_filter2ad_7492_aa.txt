## Abstract
Previous studies of the Internet have primarily focused on traffic and topology, often neglecting edge hosts. Although the number of Internet hosts is vast, many are hidden behind firewalls or in private address spaces. This paper introduces two new approaches to explore the visible Internet: censuses and surveys. Using statistical population sampling, we walk the entire Internet address space for censuses and probe a fraction of that space frequently for surveys. Our findings indicate that only 3.6% of allocated addresses are occupied by visible hosts, with occupancy unevenly distributed. We estimate that approximately 34 million addresses are very stable and visible, projecting up to 60 million stable, Internet-accessible computers. The remaining allocated addresses are used intermittently, with a median occupancy of 81 minutes. Additionally, we observe significant diversity in the distribution of firewalled block sizes. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive census of edge hosts since 1982, and the first to evaluate the accuracy of active probing for address census and survey.

## 1. Introduction
Measurement studies of the Internet have predominantly focused on network traffic and topology. Many surveys have characterized network traffic in general and in specific cases, while recent research has investigated network topology at both the AS and router levels. These studies have provided insights into network traffic, business relationships, routing opportunities, and risks.

However, these studies have largely ignored the population of hosts at the edge of the network. Understanding end-host characteristics can provide valuable insights. Simple questions about hosts, such as the number of hosts, their density in the IPv4 address space, and the trends in address utilization, have profound implications for network and protocol design. As ICANN approaches full allocation of the IPv4 address space, it is crucial to understand how the currently allocated space is used.

This paper introduces two new methodologies to study the Internet address space: complete censuses and frequent surveys. We are the first to take a complete Internet census since 1982, and we also evaluate the effectiveness of surveys that frequently probe a small fraction of the edge of the network. Our goal is to understand the host-level structure of the Internet, which is complex due to the relationship between IP addresses and computers. We use active probing to measure the visible Internet and estimate specific sources of measurement error.

Our methodologies help us estimate characteristics of the Internet, such as typical address occupancy and the size of the stable Internet. We find that only 3.6% of allocated addresses are occupied by visible hosts, with occupancy unevenly distributed. We also study trends in the deployment of firewalls on the public Internet, observing significant diversity in the distribution of firewalled block sizes.

## 2. Census and Survey Methodology
Statistical population sampling uses two tools: censuses, which enumerate all members of a population, and surveys, which consider only a sample. We adapt these approaches to study the Internet address space. Censuses capture unexpected variation or rare characteristics, while surveys are less expensive and can be taken more frequently.

### 2.1 Probing Design
Our approaches involve active probing, similar to tools like Nmap. For each address, we send a single probe message and record the time until a reply is received, along with any positive or negative reply code. We use ICMP echo-request messages because they are generally considered benign and elicit fewer abuse complaints than TCP probes. Each ICMP echo request can result in several potential replies, which we interpret as follows:
- **Positive acknowledgment:** An echo reply (type 0) indicates the presence of a host.
- **Negative acknowledgment:** A destination unreachable (type 3) indicates the host is down or the address is unused. We interpret certain response codes as indications of a firewall.
- **No reply:** Non-response can be due to congestion, intentional discard by a firewall, or an unoccupied address.

### 2.2 Census Design and Implementation
Our census enumerates the allocated Internet address space, excluding private and multicast addresses. We determine the currently allocated address space from IANA, which includes addresses assigned to registrars but not yet injected into global routing tables. We probe all allocated addresses, not just those currently routed, to capture a complete snapshot of the Internet.

### 2.3 Survey Design and Implementation
Surveys involve selecting the frequency and sample of addresses to probe. We need a sample large enough to be representative but small enough to allow frequent probing. We select an interval of 11 minutes and a survey size of about 1% of the allocated address space, or 24,000 /24 blocks. This provides good coverage and reasonable measurement error.

## 3. Results and Analysis
Our censuses and surveys provide valuable insights into the visible Internet. We find that only 3.6% of allocated addresses are occupied by visible hosts, with occupancy unevenly distributed. We estimate that approximately 34 million addresses are very stable and visible, projecting up to 60 million stable, Internet-accessible computers. The remaining allocated addresses are used intermittently, with a median occupancy of 81 minutes. We also observe significant diversity in the distribution of firewalled block sizes.

## 4. Conclusion
This paper introduces two new methodologies to study the Internet address space: complete censuses and frequent surveys. Our findings provide valuable insights into the visible Internet, including the occupancy of allocated addresses, the stability of visible hosts, and the distribution of firewalled block sizes. These results lay the groundwork for future research in understanding the host-level structure of the Internet.
