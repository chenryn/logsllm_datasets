I'm creating pagination like the example in the documentation. I have previous
and next links on each side and links to each page in the middle.
Out of the box doesn't look great when I scale down to a phone (wraps in the
middle) so I figured I'd put .hidden-xs on the middle page number links so
when I view on a phone it's just prev and next.
That caused it to look great on the phone, but on larger displays the
"display: block !important;" causes the buttons to be stacked vertically.
Ideally there should be responsive pagination options.
