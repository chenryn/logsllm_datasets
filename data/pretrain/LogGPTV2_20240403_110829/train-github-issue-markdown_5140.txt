I am currently working on implementing pagination, following the example provided in the documentation. My design includes "Previous" and "Next" links on each side, with page number links in the middle.

However, when I scale down to a mobile view, the layout doesn't look very good as the page number links wrap awkwardly in the middle. To address this, I applied the `.hidden-xs` class to the middle page number links, so that only the "Previous" and "Next" links are visible on mobile devices. This change improved the appearance on phones, but introduced a new issue: on larger displays, the `display: block !important;` style causes the buttons to stack vertically instead of appearing horizontally.

Ideally, there should be a responsive pagination solution that adjusts gracefully across different screen sizes. Below is a screenshot illustrating the current behavior:
