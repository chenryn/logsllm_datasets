Eventlisteners for doctrine LifecycleEvents are not registered on the default
event manager that is available as service in the controller.
Reproduce:
  1. write an event listener
    class L{
        protected $os;
        public function __construct(MyOtherService $os){
          $this->os = $os;
        }
        public function postPersist(LifecycleEventArgs $args){
            $this->isFatal();
        }
    }
  2. register as service
    service:
      my_listener:
        class: \yadda\yadda\L
        arguments:
          - @my.other.service
        tags:
          - { name: doctrine.event_listener, event: postPersist }
Debuging in the controller shows no listeners are attached to the event
manager on the ntity manager.
