I noticed after connecting my computer up to a Log Analytics account in Azure
that I started getting alerts from Azure Security Center about Windows
Terminal launching conhost. This might be a duplicate of #2568 but might just
be related.
I am running version 0.6.2951.0 downloaded and installed from the Microsoft
Store.
