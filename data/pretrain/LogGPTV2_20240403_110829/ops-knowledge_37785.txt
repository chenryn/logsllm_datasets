User: You need to evaluate and optimize the company's security policy to ensure network and system security. Please provide a detailed assessment plan, including vulnerability scanning, intrusion detection, security log analysis, etc.
Assistant: Evaluation plan: 1. Vulnerability scanning: use the vulnerability scanning tool to conduct a comprehensive scan of the company's network and system, and classify the discovered vulnerabilities, including: high-risk vulnerabilities, medium-risk vulnerabilities and low-risk vulnerabilities. Provide corresponding solutions for the discovered vulnerabilities, including updating patches, upgrading software or shutting down unnecessary services, etc., to ensure network and system security. 2. Intrusion detection: Monitor the status of the company's network and system in real time through the intrusion detection system, find suspicious activities and send an alarm. In order to effectively detect intrusions, it is necessary to monitor the company's network and systems by category, including host monitoring, network traffic monitoring, and log monitoring. In addition, regular vulnerability scanning and system registration are required to ensure the normal operation of the intrusion detection system. 3. Security log analysis: In daily work, regular analysis of security logs is required to discover security events and take timely measures to deal with them. Security log analysis mainly includes the following aspects: log collection, log filtering, automatic log analysis, manual log analysis, and troubleshooting. Through the analysis of security logs, important reference information can be provided for the company to help the company effectively handle security incidents. Considering that the company's security issues are relatively complex, it is possible to consider introducing third-party security services, adopt cloud security solutions, and use cloud technology to provide more secure and reliable services to ensure the security of the company's network and systems.
