For example:
https://github.com/6to5/6to5/tree/master/lib/6to5/transformation/transformers/es6-generators
You're effectively forking the code, and making it much more difficult for you
to incorporate updates quickly (or contribute changes upstream). It's unclear
what version of Regenerator these files even represent. I don't understand the
benefit you imagine this has for 6to5 or any of its contributing libraries.
This isn't how open source should work!
Sorry for the alarmist tone, but this is a real problem. I'm happy to work
with you to make Regenerator easier to use as an NPM package.
Thanks.
