User: For a new server, how to perform preliminary system security hardening?
Assistant: The following are suggestions for preliminary system security hardening for a new server: 1. Configure firewall: you can block unexpected unnecessary network access, thereby preventing attackers from exploiting loopholes to invade the system. 2. Close unnecessary ports: Only open limited ports to reduce the attack surface. It is recommended to close unnecessary or unsafe services, such as FTP, SMTP, etc. 3. Disable root login: Disable or restrict root user login to prevent it from becoming the preferred target of attackers. 4. Update system software packages: upgrade the operating system and its software packages and patches to make up for known security holes in the old version. 5. Install security software: deploy anti-virus software, firewall, intrusion detection system and other functions to ensure the security and reliability of the system. 6. Configure account and password policies: set complex password policies, and limit the length and complexity of account numbers and passwords to enhance security. 7. Disable unnecessary services: close unnecessary services, especially some dangerous ports, to prevent attacks. In short, system security hardening is a continuous work. It is necessary to keep an eye on new vulnerabilities and attacks, update security measures in a timely manner, and strengthen security protection.
