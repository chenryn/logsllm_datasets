Figure 11a presents |H| of the injected (Subframe 9) and
legitimate signals measured during the experiment in LOS
setup, where the attacker is located 2m away from the victim
UE. This clearly demonstrates the severe ﬂuctuation of |H|
when the attack occurs, indicating effortless detection.
Despite its effectiveness, the robustness of leveraging the
channel is problematic. In particular, the general application
of the technique to various scenarios is not trivial, due to
the various factors that have a potential inﬂuence on H. Fig-
ure 11b shows a detection failure example in NLOS setup,
when the power of the injected signal was low. That is, the
impact of the attack signal to H gradually fades out as the en-
ergy decreases, down to the point where it is difﬁcult to detect.
Figure 11c clearly demonstrates this challenge, wherein the
drop in the correlation was fuzzy in NLOS setup, unlike in the
LOS setup (strong injection signal). In summary, leveraging
the channel is a potential solution, where we leave the design
of robust techniques as future work.
6.3 Discussion on Potential Solutions
Both approaches discussed in the previous sections present
challenges to be addressed and/or limitations. However, we
note that the exploits demonstrated in Section 5 are only a
few examples rather than an exhaustive list. The effects of the
SigOver attack would be broader and more damaging if the
cellular network is utilized for critical domains, e.g., vehicu-
lar networks and industrial systems. Therefore, in principle,
the intrinsic broadcast vulnerabilities of the cellular system
should be addressed. Meanwhile, it is recommended that criti-
cal services should have their own security protection instead
of relying on those of other protocol layers. For example, the
issue of the ETWS or CMAS may be better addressed at the
application level13, instead of being based on SIB protection,
since the SIB is only a transport mechanism for those critical
application messages.
7 Related Work
In this section, we describe previous work that exploits the
signal overshadowing concept. We then present the signaling
storm, in addition to attacks that exploit the non-integrity
protection.
Signal overshadowing in wireless channel. The signal over-
shadowing attack, which exploits the use of an open medium
and the capture effect, has been widely conducted in the wire-
less systems such as GPS [20, 45] and Low-Rate Wireless
Personal Area Networks (LR-WPANs) [52]. Pöpper et al.
presented a symbol ﬂipping attack on the Additive White
Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel [34], with a ﬁne-grained
overshadowing of the signal at the symbol level. However,
it requires exact information with respect to the timing, am-
plitude, and phase, which is difﬁcult to achieve in the real

Warning System (PWS) [4].

subscription as they may not be able to get the public param-
eters from the network. Note that the unsubscribed devices
are also supposed to receive the ETWS or CMAS messages
as long as they have cellular capabilities.
6.2 Leveraging the Channel Diversity
According to communication theory, a wireless channel varies
signiﬁcantly with a displacement of only a quarter of the wave-
length, which is 3.57cm for 2.1GHz LTE [46]. This is referred
to as the channel diversity, and it is highly applicable to the
attacker and victim UE, which are expected to be at different
locations – i.e., the wireless channel between the attacker
and UE is likely to be disparate from that between the eNB
and UE. Therefore, the injection of the attack signal, which
reﬂects the channel between the attacker and UE, naturally
forces the channel information recovered at the UE to deviate
from when only the legitimate subframes are present (without
attack). In other words, the detection of such a variance in the
channel could serve as a defense technique.
The wireless channel can be conventionally represented
as H [46] in complex representation. The magnitude |H|
uniquely deﬁnes different wireless channels depending on
how efﬁciently the signal power is delivered. Hence, an abrupt
change in |H| is an effective metric to detect SigOver attack.

world. Similar to this study, Wilhelm et al. demonstrated the
possibility of signal overshadowing and its impact on IEEE
802.15.4 [52]. In comparison, the SigOver attack is the ﬁrst
comprehensive study in which the signal overshadowing at-
tack on the LTE was realized, in addition to the validation
of its practicability. Moreover, we present the novel attack
scenarios by leveraging the SigOver attack.
Message manipulation in LTE. The LTEInspector [21] con-
ducted a paging channel hijacking attack and paging message
injection attack, which seems similar to this study. However,
this study has two key differences: 1) the deﬁnition of the in-
jection attack and 2) its realization method. First, the SigOver
attack silently injects the victim with malicious messages
while making the victim keep being synchronized with the
legitimated eNB. As a result, during the SigOver attack, the
uplink response message of the victim naturally goes to the
legitimated eNB. However, the victim UE in LTEInspector
transmitted its uplink response message to the malicious eNB
after receiving the manipulated message, which is the gen-
eral response action for the attack with the FBS. Thus, it
is more similar to existing attacks using FBS. Second, the
SigOver attack overwrites the target signal with malicious
signals without requiring a connection to the malicious base
station. To this end, we investigate various requirements of
the SigOver attack as described in Section 3. Despite other
requirements, LTEInspector only considered the paging cycle
and its occasion, which are the part of timing synchronization
requirements.
Attacks exploiting non-integrity protection. Extensive re-
search has been conducted on the manipulation of messages
with no/weak-integrity protection [21, 22, 26, 36, 39, 40]. As
discussed in Section 3.5, such attacks mainly leverage an FBS.
Although they exploited the broadcast messages in LTE, but
the attacks have limited implications. This is because their
operational logic inevitably produces limitations with respect
to stealthiness, power efﬁciency, and attack sustainability.
8 Concluding Remarks and Future Work
Signal overshadowing is an intuitive method for the manipula-
tion of LTE broadcast messages with no integrity protection,
which was not addressed in previous studies. In this paper,
we present the SigOver attack, which outlines the ﬁrst real-
ization of a signal overshadowing attack on the LTE network.
We implement the SigOver attack using a low-cost SDR and
open source LTE library, while resolving the challenges in
satisfying the stringent transmission requirements and craft-
ing a malicious frame. The feasibility and effectiveness of
SigOver attack was demonstrated in ﬁve novel attacks, and an
extensive analysis of the relative advantages of the SigOver
attack over those of the FBS and MitM attacks was carried out.
The key features of the SigOver attack are stealthiness, power-
efﬁciency, and sustainability, which have not been achieved
simultaneously by previous attacks. The evaluation revealed
that the SigOver attack achieves a 98% success rate with low
power cost.
Finally, two potential approaches to defending against the
SigOver attack were proposed, which leveraged the digital
signature and channel diversity. As acknowledged, both ap-
proaches have challenges and limitations to be addressed;
however, they can be used as a basis for the development of a
reliable and robust solution.
The cellular industry is rapidly transitioning to the 5G
network of cellular systems equipped with advanced radio
technologies and enhanced security features. However, the
fundamental broadcast security issues discussed in this paper
have not addressed in design. Considering signiﬁcant changes
made in the 5G New Radio (NR), it is left as a future study
to evaluate 5G NR against the SigOver attack. As this paper
turns on the spotlight on the security of broadcast messages,
we believe that 3GPP standard body and cellular network
community need to consider the design of broadcast messages
seriously.
