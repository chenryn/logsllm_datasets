A bank, sometimes in collaboration with a merchant account broker, can establish a network of shell accounts and offer a payment processing service that funnels transactions through this network. In practice, various combinations of these relationships exist, with different rules applying across different operational regions. However, the underlying five-party transaction structure remains consistent across all embodiments.

### Merchant Costs
From the merchant's perspective, the goal is to achieve the lowest overhead and highest reliability possible within their risk class. Overhead is typically defined by the discount rate charged by the service provider for processing services, which is a percentage of the total revenue. For example, a low-risk retail merchant processing card payments at the point of sale might find an Independent Sales Organization (ISO) willing to provide services at a discount rate of under 2%. In contrast, a third-party aggregator serving high-risk clients might charge 10% or more. Providers often have different discount rate structures based on the risk profile of the transactions, but in the high-risk category, these distinctions are often ignored.

In addition to the discount rate, merchants usually pay monthly fees (e.g., for access to an Internet-based payment gateway or virtual terminals for entering card numbers) and per-transaction fees (which can be up to $2 in the high-risk category). Additionally, providers differ in how quickly they make payments available to merchants. In the high-risk category, it is common for providers to "hold back" a percentage of revenue as a reserve against future liabilities. These holdbacks are crucial because most card associations allow cardholders to contest a transaction many months after settlement. If a merchant disappears, the acquiring bank is responsible for the cost of the chargeback and associated fees. Therefore, high-risk account providers typically hold back 10% of revenue for 90 to 180 days to cover unforeseen losses. This money can be used to cover any fines or assessments, and if there is a complaint of criminality, the merchant can lose this sum entirely.

Merchants must also minimize the number of chargebacks, both to avoid the fees incurred and to reduce the additional scrutiny on accounts with high chargeback rates. For example, in a study of several fake anti-virus programs, Stone-Gross et al. documented how refund requests are manipulated to keep the monthly chargeback rate below trigger levels. Even merchants selling illegal goods, such as counterfeit software, employ sophisticated fraud screening to filter out fraudulent customers.

### Payment Interventions
In our 2011 paper on the spam value chain, we empirically documented that for many popular spam-advertised market niches (pharmaceuticals, replica luxury goods, and counterfeit software), payments were handled by a small number of acquiring banks. Just three banks processed over 95% of the transactions from sites advertised by spam emails. This concentration, combined with the limited number of acquirers accepting high-risk merchants, the long setup time for new banking relationships, and the liability on revenue holdback, makes the payment tier an attractive target for those seeking to combat such activities. A miscreant can replace a suspended domain name within minutes at a minimal cost, but if a banking relationship is terminated, they may lose hundreds of thousands of dollars in holdback and spend weeks finding a suitable replacement.

### Regulatory Tightening
Effective June 2011, Visa implemented changes to their operating regulations to support their Global Brand Protection Program (GBPP), targeting online pharmacies and sellers of counterfeit goods. Pharmaceutical-related Merchant Category Codes (MCCs) 5122 and 5912 were explicitly classified as "high risk," along with gambling and direct marketing services. Acquirers issuing new contracts for high-risk e-commerce merchants required significant due diligence, including $100 million in equity capital and good standing in risk management programs. Starting in December 2011, additional registration was required for Payment Service Providers (PSPs) and ISOs dealing in high-risk products and services. The new documents explicitly outlined examples of illegal transactions, including the unlawful sale of prescription drugs and the sale of counterfeit or trademark-infringing products. These changes also included a more aggressive fine schedule, signaling more stringent enforcement actions.

### Targeted Complaints
Under the new regulations (and similar ones at MasterCard), acquiring banks in violation of these rules could face a range of fines, significantly increased in the GBPP, with penalties escalating for repeated violations. Non-compliant banks, ISOs, and PSPs could have their ability to issue merchant accounts and services revoked.

In mid to late 2010, a series of negotiations between brand holders, payment providers, and the White Houseâ€™s Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator established agreements to streamline targeted actions against merchant accounts used to monetize counterfeit goods and services. Individual brand holders could submit evidence of infringement to the card networks, who would then identify the associated acquiring bank and request remediation. The International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition (IACC) also launched a larger-scale initiative in September 2011, providing a standard portal for brandholders to report infringing e-commerce sites. The IACC, with their contractors and the card networks, would then manage the formal complaint process.

### Methodology
Our work builds on previous efforts in Levchenko et al. [10], where we actively identified the acquiring banks used to process consumer orders from websites sponsored by specific affiliate programs. This task involves two parts: affiliate program identification and payment tracking.

Unlike our previous work, we do not need to automatically classify arbitrary web pages. Instead, it is sufficient to identify a small number of reference sites sponsored by each program. While there is no single "silver bullet" approach for identifying such sites, our domain knowledge and the open nature of most affiliate programs have been helpful. For each program identified in Levchenko et al., we already have a list of reference sites and a hand-crafted classifier for identifying the template structure of the sites advertised by each program. We also identified new programs by monitoring underground forums, as new programs must advertise to acquire new affiliates. From these, we identified representative sites either from forum-documented "public" sites or by joining the program as an affiliate. We were able to identify 40 different programs (25 focused on pharmaceutical sales and 15 on the sale of counterfeit "OEM" software).

Having obtained these representative sites, we next tied the affiliate program to a particular acquiring bank at a particular point in time. We placed 76 credit card purchases over three months and worked with the issuing bank to identify the individual acquirers used in each transaction. We built on this dataset in partnership with multiple payment card issuing institutions, who provided us with full transactional data for each purchase. This includes the Bank Identification Number (BIN) for the acquiring institution, the textual order descriptor, the Card Acceptor ID, and the country of the acquirer, among other details.

For this paper, we focus on a subset of this dataset comprising pharmaceutical and OEM software affiliate programs. Our combined dataset includes 676 ordering attempts, of which 429 were successful, covering over two years of activity. Table 1 lists the affiliate programs we engaged with and our purchasing activity with them.

### Limitations
Our dataset has several limitations. First, all our orders were made using the Visa card network, so our results do not capture information related to MasterCard. However, MasterCard merchant accounts appear much harder to obtain for pharmaceutical affiliates. At any given time, only a small minority of the programs we studied had working MasterCard processing. Second, our samples are neither uniform nor always cover the same period. There is a large gap between April 2011 and August 2011 during which few orders were placed. Additionally, while we attempted to place orders at least once a month for each program, this was not always possible due to operational complexities. Finally, some programs have become better at counter-intelligence, and some refusals may not be due to true payment processing problems but an active attempt to "blind" such measurements.

### Third-Party Information
We also have the benefit of third-party information, particularly targeted complaint activity driven by brand holders starting in November 2011. We have key information about when particular complaints were made, providing an empirical basis for a natural experiment examining the impact of these payment-oriented interventions. We present a subset of this data, consisting of roughly 170 complaints against the merchant accounts of over 25 distinct affiliate programs.

### Qualitative Data
We also obtained qualitative data by continuously monitoring related underground forums and affiliate "news" pages. These sources allowed us to capture anecdotal reports from individual affiliates and affiliate program managers, providing a form of validity check on the conclusions we reach from analyzing the empirical purchasing and complaint data alone.

### Analysis
Using the data described, we examine how affiliate programs rely on the global banking infrastructure to process payment card transactions. Specifically, we look at which banks are used to support these activities over time, how the affiliate programs are distributed and concentrated among the banks, the strategies employed in using banking resources while balancing risk and overhead, and how the programs react to pressure such as active takedown interventions.

### Aggregate Bank Activity
In aggregate, we executed 429 orders from 25 pharmaceutical and 15 software affiliate programs. These were processed through 30 acquiring banks: 25 distinct banks for pharmaceutical programs, 15 banks for software programs, and 10 banks for both. Five of the banks processed only one or two purchases in less than a month and appear to have been used on a trial basis. Discounting these, we found 25 banks supporting the card processing activities of the 40 programs combined.

Examining how these banks are used over time reveals some interesting patterns.
