Objectives: We were interested in characteristic patterns of metabolism in periods of preparation for and participation in a marathon race of 76 
male athletes at different performance levels Methods: We used a targeted metabolomics approach to analyse blood plasma samples of 76 male 
subjects who participated in the Munich marathon in 2013 (Enzy-MaGIC-Study) Metabolic changes were analysed at two different time points before 
and three time points after the marathon race To reveal characteristic features between runners at different training levels, the cohort was stratified 
into top, average, and low performers based on general endurance (relative VO2max) and net running time during the marathon race Results: 
In general, we observed increased concentrations of acylcarnitines (AC) and reduced concentrations of amino acids (AA) and phospholipids (PL) 
immediately after the race when compared to pre-exercise levels In the following 24 hours and 72 hours a massive supercompensation of AA and 
PL levels became apparent Furthermore, the metabolite profiles revealed performer class related characteristics in terms of the different periods of 
structured exercise Most pronounced differences between performer classes were observed for acylcarnitines and urea cycle related amino acids 
immediately after the race In conclusion, our study shows characteristic metabolite patterns between pre- and post-marathon race time points and 
reveals performance-dependent differences with regards to marathon-induced changes of the metabolome

Blood metabolites are easily accessible biomarkers that can extend routine clinical chemistry The utilization of non-fasted blood samples 
considerably simplifies blood sampling for patients and clinicians However, the metabolite readout reflects the current metabolic status with 
substantial differences between fasted and fed states, which need to be considered for clinical interpretation Additionally, dietary intake has shown 
to increase subject variability Therefore, it is vital to know the fasting status at the time of sampling We propose two machine learning prediction 
models that provide an objective differentiation of plasma samples into non-fasting (less than 4h or 6h postprandial) and fasting states We used an 
iterative random forest approach with backward variable selection, trained on the time-resolved HuMet dataset comprising 56 time points with four 
different meal and fasting periods in 15 healthy men In this study, a total of 595 metabolites were identified by non-targeted mass spectrometry-
based metabolomics The 4h prediction model contains nine metabolites that display two distinct mirror-like kinetic patterns: The first group of 
metabolites including glucose, fructose, and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate, demonstrates elevated metabolite levels during non-fasting and low 
levels during fasting time points Six fatty acids (mostly medium-chain) demonstrate a mirror-inverted behavior to the first group In addition to the 
same six fatty acids, our 6h prediction model includes nucleotides and bile acids, which show comparatively slower postprandial changes in blood 
levels Notably, our models can classify plasma samples with a low error rate (< 8,4%) The usability of our prediction models will be validated in large 
cohort studies

PRESENTING AUTHOR: Seoyoung Jang, Korea Basic Science Institue, South Korea
CO-AUTHORS: Juhwan Noh, Changsoo Kim, Geum-Sook Hwang
Particulate matter (PM) has became a major environmental risk factors all over the world, and related to human disease such as respiratory 
disease, nervous system disorder We evaluate the change in response to environmental exposure and to investigate the association between 
concentrations of identified metabolite in human blood samples and PM with a diameter 25-10 µm (PM10) In this study, we analyzed human whole 
blood from 457 Koreans using 1H-NMR spectroscopy We performed multivariate linear regression with the level of PM10 adjusted for age, sex, BMI, 
and smoking status We found that PM10 was significantly altered energy metabolism such as succinate, pyruvate, lactate, and fumarate This study 
demonstrated that NMR based metabolic profiling can be a useful tool and to assess the impacts of environmental pollutants on human metabolism 
and to identify potential biomarkers for predicting exposure of air pollution like PM10

Metabolite profiling of multiple measures of adiposity: A Mendelian randomization analysis
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Matthew Lee, MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, University of Bristol, United Kingdom
CO-AUTHORS: Kaitlin Wade, Laura Corbin, Nicholas Timpson
The mechanisms by which obesity affects disease are poorly understood Studying different adiposity measures together with intermediate 
phenotypes reflective of physiological function can provide valuable insight into complicated etiologic disease pathways We investigated the 
causal effect of several adiposity measures on metabolic intermediates using Mendelian randomization (MR) This epidemiological approach 
uses genetic markers as proxy measures for exposures, to avoid typical limitations of observational analyses A two-sample MR analysis was 
conducted using genetic variants for three exposures: body mass index (BMI), waist-hip-ratio (WHR), and body fat percentage (BF%) The outcomes 
comprised 123 metabolites derived from nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy An inverse variance weighted multiplicative random effects 
model was applied A newly developed web tool, MR-Vis (http://bristol-medical-statbristolacuk:3838/MR-Vis/), was used to visualize and explore 
causal perturbations of metabolic profiles in relation to exposures Across all three exposures, the direction of effect was consistent for 106 
metabolites BMI and WHR exhibited similar effects across a range of metabolites, including an inverse association with medium to large HDL and 
a positive association with a range of LDL and VLDL particles Many of the results for BF% were consistent with the null A positive association 
with glycoprotein acetyls and phenylalanine (P<005/123) was observed across all three exposures The consistency observed in the relationship 
between different measures of adiposity and metabolic intermediates suggests some redundancy in these measures However, where we see 
contrasting associations that can be mapped onto corresponding differences in disease susceptibility, our approach can provide insight into the 
biological mechanisms underpinning these differences

Joint analysis of metabolite markers of fish intake and persistent organic pollutants in relation to type 2 diabetes risk in 
Swedish adults
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Rikard Landberg, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden

Conflicting evidence exists regarding the association between fish intake and type 2 diabetes (T2D) incidence, potentially due to error-prone 
self-reported dietary intake assessments and co-exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) present in fish We identified plasma metabolites 
associated with fish intake and assessed their association with T2D risk, independently from co-exposure to POPs, in a case-control study nested 
in the Swedish prospective Västerbotten Intervention Programme cohort Plasma samples from 421 case-control pairs at baseline and 10-year 
follow-up samples from a subset of 149 pairs were analyzed using untargeted LC-MS metabolomics Moreover, 16 plasma POPs were analyzed for 
the sub-population (149 pairs) We identified 31 metabolites associated with fish intake using multivariate modelling and partial correlation analysis 
No association was observed between fish intake either reflected by metabolites or measured by food frequency questionnaires, and T2D risk, 
using a conventional multivariate logistic regression adjusted for POPs Interestingly, integrating fish-related metabolites and plasma POPs using 
two-way orthogonal partial least squares regression led to a unique metabolite component independent of POPs, which was borderline inversely 
associated with T2D risk (odds ratio:075; 95% CI: 054, 102, P=007) This component mainly reflected fatty fish intake and consisted of several 
species of phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines Our results support that fatty fish may be beneficial for T2D prevention, although 
simultaneous co-exposure to POPs may counteract those effects in Swedish adults Integrating metabolite markers and POP exposures appears a 
promising approach to advance the understanding of associations between fish intake and T2D incidence in populations co-exposed to POPs

Plasma biomarkers of boiled and filtered coffee intake and their association with type 2 diabetes risk
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Carl Brunius, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden
CO-AUTHORS: Lin Shi, Ingegerd Johansson, Ingvar A. Bergdahl, Olov Rolandsson, Kati Hanhineva, Rikard Landberg
Habitual coffee intake has been associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D), but only few studies have investigated different 
coffee brews, ie boiled and filtered, separately We identified metabolites related to either filtered or boiled coffee, and assessed their association 
with T2D risk in a nested case-control study within the Swedish prospective cohort Västerbotten Intervention Programme Plasma samples from 421 
case-control pairs at baseline and from a subset of 149 pairs at 10-y follow-up were analyzed using untargeted LC-MS metabolomics We identified 
31 metabolites that were associated with boiled- (01≤ |r| ≤ 047) and 30 associated with filtered coffee intake (01≤ |r| ≤ 034), respectively, using 
multivariate modelling and partial correlation analysis adjusted for life-style confounders Among these metabolites, 14 and 10 were unbiasedly 
selected in panels by LASSO regression for accurate and specific prediction of boiled (AROC =091) and filtered coffee (AROC =090), respectively 
Moreover, metabolite panels could also predict boiled and filtered coffee intake after 10-y of follow-up (AROC=071 and 080, respectively)
Furthermore, we observed an inverse association between the metabolite panel score related to filtered coffee and T2D risk, independent of 
established risk factors and lifestyle confounders No association was observed for boiled coffee In summary, for the first time, we identified 
metabolite panels which might be used as selective biomarkers for boiled and filtered coffee intake,respectively Our study supports a protective 
role of habitual intake of filtered coffee on T2D development

Investigating in vivo digestion of sheep and cow milk in a rat model
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Linda Samuelsson, AgResearch Ltd, New Zealand
CO-AUTHORS: Linda Samuelsson, Natalie Ahlborn, Wayne Young
Sheep milk is a rich source of vitamins, minerals and energy, with up to 50% more milk solids than cow milk Anecdotally, sheep milk is thought to 
be better tolerated than cow milk and some of these affects have been attributed to differences in milk protein digestibility However, controlled 
scientific studies examining this potential difference are lacking The purpose of this study was to compare the digestion of sheep and cow milk 
in terms of a) apparent ileal amino acid digestibility and b) metabolite profiles in serum and caecal contents in a rat model Male Sprague-Dawley 
rats were fed a dairy-free rodent chow and provided with sheep or cow milk over a 28-day period Serum, distal ileal content and caecal content 
were collected Amino acid digestibility in the distal ileum at day 28 was higher in rats fed sheep milk; amino acid intake in sheep milk rats was 18 
times higher, but the amino acid concentration in the ileal content was only 13 times higher Concentrations of essential amino acids in serum were 
significantly higher in rats fed sheep milk, indicating that sheep milk proteins are more readily digested In addition, rats fed sheep milk had higher 
concentrations of dimethyl sulfone, g-aminobutyric acid, amino acids and short-chain fatty acids in serum and caecal contents compared to rats fed 
cow milk indicating that ingestion of the two milks lead to different digestion products The potential for these products to have differential effects 
on physiology and health is yet to be established

Abdominal obesity is one of the main modifiable risk factors of age-related cardiometabolic disease Cardiometabolic disease risk and its 
associated abdominal fat mass, cholesterol and glucose levels can be reduced by a healthier lifestyle Hence, our aim is to understand the relation 
between the lifestyle intervention induced changes in body composition, and specifically abdominal fat, and the accompanying molecular changes
Therefore, we used the data from the Growing Old Together (GOTO) study, in which 164 older adults (mean age 63 years, BMI 23-35 kg/m2) 
changed their lifestyle during 13 weeks by 125% caloric restriction plus 125% increase in energy expenditure Here, we first show that the levels 
of circulating metabolic biomarkers specifically reflect the abdominal fat mass, even after adjustment for body mass index Second, we show that 
the applied lifestyle intervention mainly results in reduction of abdominal fat (-26%, SD=30) and that this reduction, when adjusted for weight 
loss, is highly associated with an increase of the HDL diameter and decrease of circulating glycerol levels To monitor the weight-loss-independent 
beneficial effects of lifestyle change, circulating glycerol levels and HDL diameter may be valuable tools

The pathogenesis of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) characterized by exertional and severely debilitating fatigue 
with/without infectious or neuropsychiatric symptoms lasting at least 6 consecutive months is not fully understood Because of incomplete 
understanding of aetiology and diagnostic uncertainty of ME/CFS, there are no firmly established objective diagnosis using biomarkers In the 
present study, we performed comprehensive metabolomic analyses of plasma samples obtained from ME/CFS patients and healthy controls in the 
United States using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS) By reference to our previous findings of inactivity in 
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) and urea cycles in ME/CFS (Yamano E, 2016), we focused on the alterations of metabolite concentrations in these metabolic 
cycles In ME/CFS patients, malate was increased and arginine was decreased relative to healthy controls The female patients with ME/CFS notably 
exhibited abnormalities in TCA and urea cycles, compared with male patients In addition, arginine/malate ratio discriminated female patients with 
ME/CFS from female healthy controls yielding area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 072 (95 % confidential interval: 
061-072, P < 00001) This suggested that ME/CFS patients in the US may also have some dysregulation of TCA and urea cycles which reflects the 
pathophysiological state in line with our finding in Japanese samples, and that sex may be the significant factor in the development of the biomarker 
for ME/CFS These findings will help to establish the objective diagnosis marker and treatment recommendations for ME/CFS

Shotgun lipidomics of human plasma provides hundreds of individual lipid measurements in a fast, reproducible, single assay, making it a useful 
quantitative method for biomarker identification In this study we trained machine intelligence models to predict obesity estimates, ie body mass 
index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR) and body fat percentage (BFP), on a lipidomic dataset of 1061 samples of the FINRISK 2012 cohort and confirmed 
the outcome by an independent validation dataset of the Malmö Diet and Cancer Cardiovascular Cohort Comparison of the different models 
revealed that the lipidome predicted BFP the best Moreover, the plasma lipidome also contains information about body fat distribution, since 
WHR was predicted more accurately than BMI These modelling results required full resolution of the lipidome to lipid species level The power of 
the lipidomics association was demonstrated by the finding that the addition of routine clinical laboratory variables, eg HDL- or LDL- cholesterol 
did not improve the model further Correlation analyses of the individual lipid species, controlled for age and separated by sex, demonstrated the 
multi-parametric nature of the correlation with the BFP Correlation profiles were similar between the three obesity estimates, but very different from 
those lipids correlating with HDL-, LDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride levels

Recent changes to habitual diet play important roles in population health, including alarming rises in obesity prevalence and chronic disease 
risk worldwide However, few objective biomarkers of recent food intake are used in nutritional epidemiology, which rely on food frequency 
questionnaires or dietary records prone to bias and selective reporting Herein, metabolomic analyses were performed on healthy participants 
(n=42) from the Diet and Genetic Intervention (DIGEST) study based on a parallel two-arm randomized clinical trial Matching urine and plasma 
specimens were collected at baseline and following a 2-week assigned Prudent or Western diet, where participants were provided all food items 
with a weight-maintaining menu plan from a dietician Targeted and non-targeted metabolite profiling was conducted using three complementary 
instrumental platforms with stringent quality control to avoid false discoveries Metabolic phenotype changes were characterized based on 
distinctive trajectories following 2 weeks of food provisions as compared to baseline habitual diet of participants when using univariate and 
multivariate statistical models Unknown metabolites associated with contrasting dietary patterns were identified with high resolution MS/MS and 
co-elution after spiking with authentic standards Top-ranked metabolite trajectories were also correlated to self-reported changes in average 
intake of macro/micronutrients from diet records For the first time, we have identified robust biomarkers sensitive to short-term changes in dietary 
patterns from food provisions that are applicable to a healthy and free-living population outside of a laboratory setting

Although health benefits of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet are established, it is not understood which specific 
compounds in foods are responsible for these benefits We utilized a step-wise approach to identify unique compounds from individual foods of 
a DASH-style diet, determined if these food-specific compounds (FSCs) are detectable in urine, and then examined relationships between these 
urinary-FSCs and blood pressure (BP) Nineteen subjects were randomized into 6-week controlled DASH-style diet interventions Untargeted, LC/
MS-based metabolomics was performed on 24-hour urine samples collected before and after each intervention and on 12 representative DASH-
style foods Linear mixed effects models were used to correlate FSCs to BP changes Mass spectrometry signals for FSCs were summed to derive a 
food-specific signature to evaluate nutrikinetics Between 66-969 compounds were determined to be FSCs and between 13-190 of these FSCs were 
detected in urine Nutrikinetics demonstrated a relationship between food consumption and presence of food specific signatures in urine Although 
no urinary FSCs were associated with BP, 16 and 6 non-FSC, urinary compounds were associated with BP and changes in BP over time, respectively 
These comprised both endogenous and exogenous compounds, including some food-related compounds that were not analyzed by LC/MS/MS 
in this study This study establishes a technical, analytical, and conceptual framework upon which future nutrimetabolomics studies can be built A 
novel aspect of this study is the use of food-specific signatures to evaluate nutrikinetics

Background: Processed meat is associated with higher risk of colorectal cancer but the estimation of intake of this heterogeneous food group in 
epidemiological studies is challenging because of the lack of sufficient details in dietary questionnaires Objective: To identify novel biomarkers 
of intake of processed meat products using metabolomics Design: An untargeted metabolomic approach based on LC-MS was applied to 
processed meat products previously digested in vitro, and to urine and plasma samples from a randomized cross-over dietary intervention in 
which 12 volunteers consumed successively 3 processed meat products and two other control foods during 3 days The identified biomarkers 
were then measured in urine from 474 subjects from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC) cross-sectional study 
for which a 24h dietary recall and food frequency questionnaires were available Results: Syringol and four derivatives of syringol were found to 
be characteristic of digests of smoked meat products The same compounds present as sulfate esters in urine showed increased levels following 
consumption of smoked meat products in the intervention study They were also positively associated with recent and habitual consumption of 
smoked meat products in urine samples from participants of the EPIC cross-sectional study These markers showed good discriminative ability for 
smoked meat intake with receiver operator characteristic areas under the curve up to 086 and 079 for short-term and habitual intake, respectively 
Conclusions: The biomarkers of smoked meat intake identified in this study may be used to improve assessment of smoked meat intake in 
epidemiological studies

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-related death in men The 
associations between PCa risk and pre-diagnostic metabolite levels have been previously investigated, but have yielded inconclusive results 
We used a liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry untargeted metabolomics approach to look for metabolites associated with 
the risk of future PCa in fasting plasma using a nested case-control study design of 777 pairs of PCa cases and their matched controls (n = 1554) 
recruited from Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study Cohort (NSHDS) In order to avoid variation we only included cases with a follow-up of 
over 5 years Within this cohort an additional sub-cohort of cases with aggressive PCa was identified (n = 169 pairs) A range of health parameters 
(ia body mass index, 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test, food frequency questionnaire answers) was collected for all subjects at baseline The 
untargeted metabolomics approach identified approximately 3000 features, which were further condensed into approximately 1200 features using 
a novel batch matching algorithm The associations of the metabolomic features with the health parameters were investigated using conditional
