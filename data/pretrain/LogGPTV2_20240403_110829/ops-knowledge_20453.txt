I am currently working on a project that requires the use of Python 3.3 and Celery. I have been following the initial tutorial, but I keep encountering errors related to libraries such as `_subprocess`. Does anyone have more information on this issue? 

Additionally, I attempted to replace `_subprocess` with `_winapi`, but it resulted in even more errors. I am open to any suggestions, and any help on this matter would be greatly appreciated.

**Additional Information:**
- I am using a Windows machine.
- RabbitMQ is being used as the broker.

It appears that Celery does not yet work seamlessly with Python 3.3 on Windows. I tested the same setup on a Linux Fedora system and was able to get it to work without issues. This problem is expected to be addressed in future updates of the package, so please be patient.
