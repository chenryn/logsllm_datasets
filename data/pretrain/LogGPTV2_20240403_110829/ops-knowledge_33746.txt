User: Please describe the implementation of system monitoring and alerting, as well as commonly used monitoring systems and alerting services, such as Zabbix, Prometheus, PagerDuty, etc.
Assistant: System monitoring refers to the process of real-time monitoring of various indicators of the system to detect whether the system status is normal and abnormal through regular or temporary detection. System monitoring can help administrators find problems and solve them in time, preventing problems from expanding and causing serious losses. System alarm is a function that can send relevant alarms to administrators in a timely manner. When system failures or performance problems occur, the service can notify administrators in time. There are three commonly used system monitoring methods: active, passive and hybrid. Active monitoring is to actively initiate a request to the monitored object to obtain relevant information, and it needs to occupy certain resources of the monitored object. Passive monitoring is to receive the data sent by the monitored object, and process and analyze the data. Hybrid monitoring combines the advantages of active/passive monitoring, taking into account both monitoring coverage and resource overhead. Common system monitoring and alerting services include: 1. Zabbix: A popular open source monitoring system, suitable for systems of various scenarios and scales. It monitors various system metrics and provides alerting capabilities, and can be integrated with third-party communication applications to enhance its functionality. For example, Zabbix can monitor the server's CPU usage, memory usage, hard disk space and other indicators, and trigger an alarm notification when the preset threshold is exceeded. 2. Prometheus: An open source system monitoring and alerting tool that supports powerful data models and flexible query languages. It automatically discovers system components and checks their status, including hosts, containers, services, databases, and more. For example, Prometheus can be used to monitor the running status and performance indicators of containerized applications, and set alert rules to detect and resolve abnormalities in a timely manner. 3. Graphite: A web-based open source monitoring tool, suitable for monitoring CPU, memory, network card, storage and other indicators in large-scale visualized systems. For example, Graphite can be used to monitor network server bandwidth usage, disk IO and other indicators, and provide real-time monitoring information to administrators through dashboard display and alarm notification. 4. Nagios: A commonly used open source monitoring software, it can monitor hosts and services, and provide alarm functions. It adopts a plug-in architecture that allows users to develop custom plug-ins to monitor different types of services. For example, Nagios can be used to monitor the availability of network links, the response time of the website, etc., and notify the administrator by email, SMS, etc. 5. PagerDuty: A cloud-native alarm service that provides automated incident response and alarm processing functions. It can notify the administrator through channels such as recording, email, SMS, etc., and can make phone notifications for emergencies. For example, PagerDuty can be used to combine alerts from system monitoring with phone notifications, ensuring administrators are notified and responded to critical events in a timely manner.
