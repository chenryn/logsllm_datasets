I have a form with the following code:
    $form = $this->factory->create('Symfony\Component\Form\Extension\Core\Type\ChoiceType', null, array(
      'multiple' => false,
      'expanded' => false,
      'choices' => array(
          'label a' => false,
          'label b' => true,
      ),
      'choices_as_values' => true,
    ));
When submitting the form, none of the two radio buttons are selected, i.e. the
values are lost.
I've written a unit test for it in imphil@`71a59b7`
Currently it fails with
    There were 2 failures:
    1) Symfony\Component\Form\Tests\Extension\Core\Type\ChoiceTypeTest::testSubmitSingleExpandedBooleanValueFalse
    Failed asserting that false is identical to '0'.
    /home/philipp/src/symfony/src/Symfony/Component/Form/Tests/Extension/Core/Type/ChoiceTypeTest.php:354
    2) Symfony\Component\Form\Tests\Extension\Core\Type\ChoiceTypeTest::testSubmitSingleExpandedBooleanValueTrue
    Failed asserting that true is identical to '1'.
    /home/philipp/src/symfony/src/Symfony/Component/Form/Tests/Extension/Core/Type/ChoiceTypeTest.php:373
The problem only happens with boolean values and expanded=true. It seems that
a proper conversion to the view data is missing. Unfortunately I have no idea
about the inner workings of Symfony -- maybe someone with a bit more
experience can have a look?
(This seems to be similar to #14877, but maybe not exactly the same, so I
didn't want to hijack that issue.)
