### Abstract
In this paper, we characterize, quantify, and correct timing errors introduced into network flow data by collection and export via Cisco NetFlow version 9. While some sources of error (such as clock skew and export delay) are implementation-dependent and well-documented, we identify an additional cyclic error of up to one second that is inherent to the design of the export protocol. We present a method for correcting this cyclic error, even in the presence of clock skew and export delay. Our evaluation, using traffic with known timing from a national-scale network, demonstrates that our method can successfully correct the cyclic error. However, other implementation-specific errors remain, limiting the accuracy to about 70ms on the routers in our network. This highlights the importance of implementation choices in network measurement research.

## 1. Introduction
Network measurement involves collecting packet data at one or more observation points within a network. The collected data may undergo various transformations, such as sampling or assembly into flows. These transformed data are then exported, collected, aggregated, filtered, stored, and analyzed to derive meaningful information about the network. Ideally, each stage should refine the information without introducing errors or losing fidelity. However, in practice, each stage can introduce errors. Some errors, like packet loss due to insufficient provisioning or unsynchronized clocks, are well-known. Others, such as a cyclic source of timing error in NetFlow v9, are less understood. This work examines and corrects these errors, demonstrating that the accuracy of timestamps in NetFlow v9 can be improved to millisecond-level precision, although some residual errors remain.

## 2. Characterizing Timing Error in NetFlow Version 9
NetFlow v9 exports flow data in records described by templates, allowing flexible inline definition of record formats. Flow start and end timestamps are expressed in terms of uptime, which is the time elapsed since the device started. This approach avoids the need for a real-time clock at the metering process. Each export packet includes an export timestamp in UNIX epoch time and the uptime. The derived basetime (tbase) is calculated as tbase = pexport - puptime. However, the export time is truncated to second-level precision, causing a cyclic error of up to one second. Additionally, clock skew and export delays further complicate the situation. Figure 1 illustrates these sources of error.

## 3. Quantifying Timing Errors in NetFlow v9
Our dataset includes data from SWITCH, the Swiss research and education network, collected from six Cisco routers (6500 or 7600 series). We analyzed one week of data from June 26 to July 3, 2010. Figure 2 shows the density of exported derived basetimes, revealing a daily seasonality and a maximum number of flows per export packet. Table 1 summarizes the timing errors for each source on each router, including drift, delay, and quantization. We also examined the softflowd NetFlow v9 metering and exporting process, which showed similar cyclic errors but negligible drift and no quantization.

## 4. Correcting Cyclic Error
We developed a method to correct the cyclic error in NetFlow v9 data, accounting for clock skew and export delay. Our approach uses only the timing information in the NetFlow v9 export packets, making it scalable and independent of the actual traffic content. Our evaluation shows that this method can completely remove the protocol-induced cyclic error, achieving millisecond timing resolution. However, on the Cisco 6500 and 7600 series routers, an additional flow-level inaccuracy of about 70ms remains, which we cannot fully correct due to insufficient information.

## 5. Related Work
We review related work on data fidelity in network measurement, highlighting the importance of accurate timing for various applications, such as determining the direction of bidirectional flows and measuring round-trip times for quality of service.

## 6. Conclusions
This work characterizes, quantifies, and corrects timing errors in NetFlow v9 data. We demonstrate that while the cyclic error can be corrected, other implementation-specific errors limit the overall accuracy. Our findings underscore the significance of implementation choices in network measurement research and highlight the need for careful consideration of these factors in future studies.
