User: How to access remote server using ssh command?
Assistant: Use SSH commands to operate and manage from a terminal on a remote server. The following are the steps to use the SSH command to access the remote server: 1. Open a terminal (Terminal) or a command line window. 2. Enter the following command on the command line: ssh username@remote_host where username is the username on the remote server, and remote_host is the IP address or domain name of the server. 3. Then press the Enter key. If connecting to the remote server for the first time, the terminal will prompt you to confirm the connection. Type yes and press Enter. 4. Then enter the password and press Enter. If the password is correct, you can log in to the command line interface of the remote server. 5. Enter the command to be executed on the command line to complete the remote operation. It should be noted that after completing the operation, you must use the exit or logout command to log out, otherwise the terminal on the remote server will remain connected, which may impose a burden on the server.
