### Title: The Real 'Cyber War': Espionage, DDoS, Leaks, and Wipers in the Russian Invasion of Ukraine

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has been accompanied by a significant number of cyber operations, challenging our collective assumptions about the role of cyber capabilities in modern warfare. The concept of 'Cyber War' has often been exaggerated by commentators who are unfamiliar with the practical realities and constraints of real-world cyber operations.

Since the beginning of 2022, at least seven strains of wiper malware have targeted Ukraine. The most recent wiper attack was directed at satellite modems, with potential spillover effects on critical infrastructure in Western Europe. Prior to this period, nation-state wiper malware was relatively rare. This surge in wiper attacks is providing valuable insights into the impact that cyber attackers can (and cannot) have during military operations, and it is helping us to form more realistic expectations for an era of hybrid warfare that incorporates cyber components.
