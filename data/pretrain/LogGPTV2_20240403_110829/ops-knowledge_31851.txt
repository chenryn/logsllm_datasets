User: Introduce several Linux system performance monitoring tools that you are familiar with, and their respective characteristics.
Assistant: 1. top tool top is a very convenient performance monitoring tool. It can display information such as CPU usage, memory usage, and running time of each process in the system in real time, and can also help us find the process that occupies the most resources. top also supports sorting the CPU and memory usage of processes. 2. The vmstat tool vmstat can display CPU, memory, disk I/O, network I/O and other information. The information will be displayed in a certain time interval and format, which can help us determine whether there are problems such as CPU or memory or I/O bottlenecks in the system. 3. sar tool sar is the abbreviation of System Activity Reports (System Activity Reports), which can regularly collect various index data of the system and generate reports, including CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O and network I/O and other information . sar can not only analyze data in real time and monitor system performance, but also can be used for playback of previous data, so that we can find out the cause of the problem and make effective solutions. 4. The nmon tool nmon is a Linux performance monitoring tool that can display data such as CPU, memory, disk I/O, network I/O, process and file system information. In addition to providing rich monitoring data, nmon can also find problems through system logs, syslog and snmp, and analyze and solve these problems. 5. The iostat tool iostat can monitor the disk I/O status of the system, including the disk read and write rate, the usage of the disk queue, and so on. iostat can collect the disk I/O data of the system, and can reflect the performance of the disk. The characteristics of the above tools are: top: monitor the process in real time, display the CPU and memory usage of the system vmstat: regularly monitor the CPU, memory, disk and network I/O data sar: collect and analyze historical data, generate reports regularly, Can be used for playback of previous data nmon: Provide rich monitoring data, you can find problems through system logs, syslog and snmp, and analyze and solve problems iostat: Monitor the disk I/O of the system, reflecting the disk performance and so on.
