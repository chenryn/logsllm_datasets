**What happened** :
I tried to attach a PD in the wrong zone. I had pods in us-central1-c but this
operator copy-and-pasted some examples around and created the PD in us-
central1-a.
Then the pod would not tell me why it was in ContainerCreating for long
minutes. kubectl logs didn't show anything useful and kubectl describe pod
showed me this unhelpful message:

**What you expected to happen** :
A message such as:  
"Can't connect to PD in a different zone: requested PD in "zones/us-
central1-a", pod is running in "zones/us-central1-c".
or somesuch.
**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):
gcloud compute disks create --size=100GB some-name --zone=us-central1-a
Then configure your yaml job to run on us-central1-c.
