Is there an ability to query for a selector that has extraneous space around
it? I'm left to "test" some legacy Angular.js apps, which are notorious for
this.

my `await page.waitForSelector('"What does your Ford Focus need?"')` is never
resolving, and upon DEBUG mode it never resolves.

other elements I query do however work, so it could either be the dodgy space
in thereâ€”or the fact that part of the "text" is nested in a span?
