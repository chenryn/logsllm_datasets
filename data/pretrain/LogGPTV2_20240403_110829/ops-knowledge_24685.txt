User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to use process monitor to view or log a windows login? We're having some issues with Windows 7 Roaming profiles and I was reading here that the login process can be monitored using process monitor.


  "There are a couple of ways to configure Process Monitor to record
  logon operations: one is to use Sysinternals PsExec to launch it in
  the session 0 so that it survives the logoff and subsequent logon and
  another is to use the boot logging feature to capture activity from
  early in the boot, including the logon."


How does one do either of these options using process monitor to find out what is happening during a user login?

I don't believe that either of the above are valid for Windows 7 for the following reasons:


There's no session 0 in Windows 7, as far as I know.
User environment debug logging (which is what it sounds like they're recommending) has been replaced/supplanted with the Group Policy event log.


So, my suggestion would be to start by looking at the Group Policy event log on one of the problem machines.
