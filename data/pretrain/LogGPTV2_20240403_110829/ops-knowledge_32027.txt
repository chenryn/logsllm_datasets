Assistant: 1) CC attack refers to controlling the virtual IP to send a large number of data packets to the target server to consume server resources. Solution: - Prohibit website proxy access. - Make the website as static as possible. - Limit the number of connections and modify the maximum timeout. 2) DDOS attack means that the attacker sends too much data to the network resources, causing the server to fail to operate normally. Solutions: - Adjust server defenses against traffic attacks. 3) SYN attack refers to the use of TCP protocol flaws to consume server CPU and memory resources by sending a large number of semi-connection requests. Workaround: - Decrease the timeout period. - Using SYN Gateway and SYN Proxy. - Increase the maximum number of semi-joins. - Use SYN cookies technology to verify the legitimacy of data packets. 4) SQL injection refers to an attack that tricks the server into executing malicious SQL commands. Solutions: - Scan and encrypt the database. - Use a database firewall. - Validate user input and avoid database connections with administrator privileges. 5) ARP attack refers to the realization of ARP spoofing by forging IP and MAC addresses, resulting in network congestion and man-in-the-middle attacks. Solution: - Set a static ARP mapping table on the client. - Set up access control on the switch to filter IP and MAC addresses that do not match the gateway. - Divide the broadcast domain by VLAN to reduce the scope of infection.
