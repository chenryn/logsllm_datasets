## Checklist
- This issue occurs on the master branch and in previously released versions.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Examine the file `celery/celery/backends/redis.py` at line 22 in commit `b266860`:
   ```python
   from . import async, base
   ```

2. Examine the file `celery/celery/backends/rpc.py` at line 20 in commit `b266860`:
   ```python
   from .async import AsyncBackendMixin, BaseResultConsumer
   ```

3. Refer to the `async.py` module in the Celery repository:
   - [GitHub Link](https://github.com/celery/celery/blob/master/celery/backends/async.py)

## Expected Behavior
The module should not be named `async`, as it is a reserved keyword in Python and causes syntax errors.

## Actual Behavior
The module is currently named `async`.

## Additional Information
When attempting to run tests with Python 3.7, I encountered the following error:
```plaintext
  File "celery/backends/redis.py", line 22
    from . import async, base
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

This error is due to the use of `async` as a module name, which is a reserved keyword in Python 3.7 and later versions.
