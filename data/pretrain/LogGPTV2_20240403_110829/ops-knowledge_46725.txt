Assistant: Seems like your server simply does not know about zone you've configured.


Check permissions to zone file.
Check whether zone file lies where it should (you've used absolute file path - I'd avoid this as it complicates switching between chrooted and non-chrooted environment for named). Are you running named in chroot?
Check logs for any additional messages about your zone (enable logging in named or enable logging for daemon facility in syslog).
