# Bug report
Both "module" export and "import" export of exports field are resolved in
duplication.
**What is the current behavior?**
3rd party lib swr's output assets are resolved in different cases:
  * When swr is imported, it resolves to `swr/dist/index.esm.js`
  * Then subpath import `swr/infinite` is imported, which is relying on `swr`
  * Then swr is resolved in 2nd time, but now `swr/dist/index.mjs` is resolved
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
https://github.com/beeebox/webpack-esm-duplicated-resolve
yarn start  
browser should open on localhost:3000  
open devtools and search "swr"  
you'll see `swr/dist/index.esm.js` and `swr/dist/index.mjs` are both resolved
there
**What is the expected behavior?**
`swr/dist/index.mjs` or `swr/dist/index.esm.js` is resolved only all the time
