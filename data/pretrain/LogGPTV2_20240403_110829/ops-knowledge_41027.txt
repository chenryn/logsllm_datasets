It sounds like you're having trouble finding the right installer for Python 2.6 and are concerned about it overwriting your existing Python 2.5 installation. I understand your concern, but you can actually have multiple versions of Python installed on your computer without them interfering with each other.

Hereâ€™s how you can install Python 2.6 alongside your existing Python 2.5:

1. **Download the Installer:**
   - Visit the official Python website (python.org) and download the `.msi` installer for Python 2.6.
   
2. **Custom Installation:**
   - Run the installer and choose a custom installation.
   - During the installation, make sure to specify a different directory for Python 2.6. For example, you could install it in `C:\Python26` instead of the default location.
   
3. **Environment Variables:**
   - Ensure that the environment variables (like `PATH`) are set up correctly. You can add the new Python 2.6 directory to the `PATH` variable, or you can manage which version is used by adjusting the order of directories in the `PATH`.

4. **Verify Installation:**
   - After installation, you can verify that both Python 2.5 and Python 2.6 are installed by running `python2.5 --version` and `python2.6 --version` from the command line.

By following these steps, you should be able to use both Python 2.5 and Python 2.6 on your PC without any conflicts.
