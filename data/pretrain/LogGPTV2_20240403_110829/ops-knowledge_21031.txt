User: How to load balance the website to improve access speed and stability?
Assistant: To load balance the website to improve access speed and stability, the following measures can be taken: 1. Hardware load balancer: use hardware devices, such as load balancers, to distribute traffic to multiple servers in order to expand load capacity and enhance redundancy. 2. Software load balancer: use software, such as NGINX or Apache, to distribute the traffic to multiple servers through a load balancing algorithm, and return the response traffic to the user. 3. DNS load balancing: Use DNS resolution to resolve domain names to multiple IP addresses, and distribute traffic to servers on these IP addresses through DNS domain name resolvers. 4. Cloud load balancing: use the load balancing function of cloud service providers to distribute traffic to multiple instances, expand load capacity and enhance redundancy. 5. Flow control: By limiting the number of requests that each user can send, limiting the bandwidth that each IP address can use, using cache to reduce requests to the server, etc., to disperse traffic and reduce server pressure. 6. Server cluster: Distribute and balance traffic among multiple servers in order to expand load capacity and improve stability. Servers realize data synchronization by sharing file systems or databases.
