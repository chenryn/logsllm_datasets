User: When it comes to organizing python modules, my Mac OS X system is a mess. I've packages lying around everywhere on my hdd and no particular system to organize them.
How do you keep everything manageable?
Assistant: There are several families of Python componentry.

The stuff that comes with Python.  This takes care of itself.
The stuff that you got with easy_install.  This, also, takes care of itself.
The packages that you had to get some other way, either as TARballs or SVN checkouts. Create a Components folder.  Put the downloads or the SVN's in there first.  Every Single Time.  Do installs from there.
The packages that you wrote that are reusable.  I have a Projects folder with each project in that folder.  If the project is a highly reusable thing, it has a setup.py and I actually run the install as if I downloaded it.   I don't have many of these, but a few.  Some of them might become open source projects.
The final applications you write.  I have a folder in Projects with each of these top-level applications.  These are usually big, rambling things (like Django sites) and don't have setup.py.  Why?  They're often pretty complex with only a few server installations to manage, and each of those server installations is unique.  These generally rely on PYTHONPATH to identify their parts.

Notice the common theme.  Either they're Components you downloaded or they're Projects you're working on.
Also, I keep this separate (to an extent) from the client.  I have a master directory of Client folders, each of which has Projects and each project has Sales and Delivery.  Not all projects have both sales and delivery.
