# G0043: Group5
## Description
Group5, as detailed on [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0043), is a threat actor with a suspected connection to Iran, though this attribution is not definitive. This group has targeted individuals associated with the Syrian opposition through spearphishing and watering hole attacks, often employing themes related to Syria and Iran. The group has been known to use two widely available remote access tools (RATs), [njRAT](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0385) and [NanoCore](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0336), as well as an Android RAT called DroidJack.
