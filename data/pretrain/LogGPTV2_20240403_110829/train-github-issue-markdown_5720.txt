Hello,
Recently I have been struggling with weird and unexpected behavior of numpy,
and would like to have some help.
Here is my code:
    import numpy as np
    vec = np.random.uniform(-0.5, 0.5, size=(100)).astype(np.float32)
    print(np.linalg.norm(vec))
This code returns very differently every run including
  1. `0.0`
  2. `nan` along with `RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in sqrt`
  3. Very large value, i.e. `6074001000.0`
  4. Good value, i.e. `1.4142135`
Further I confirmed that it works fine if I don't have `.astype`, but I need
`vec` to be float32 for following process.
My environment is
    OS: macOS High Sierra
    numpy version: 1.14.0
    python version: anaconda3-5.1.0 (install with pyenv)
Thank you
