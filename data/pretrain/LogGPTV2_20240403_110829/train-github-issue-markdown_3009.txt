### Feature Request

**Current Behavior:**
In the new developer tool, it is not possible to determine the data type (e.g., string or integer) of a property value. Previously, you could identify the data type by the presence or absence of quotation marks. For example, `id: "1"` indicated a string, while `id: 1` indicated an integer. Now, both strings and integers are displayed without quotation marks, making it difficult to distinguish between them.

**Expected Behavior:**
I would like to be able to see whether the value in a prop or state is a string or an integer. This can be achieved by using quotation marks for string values. For example, `id: "1"` should indicate a string, while `id: 1` should indicate an integer.
