**What is the current behavior?**  
On the new developer tool you are unable to see what property type the value.
You used to be able to see if the value was a string or int because of the
quotation marks (for example id: "1" (string) or id: 1 (int)). Both string and
int are shown without quotes.
**What is the expected behavior?**  
I want to see if the value inside the prop or state is an string or integer by
using quotation marks on the value.  
`id: "1"`
