User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to findout the time that the server went down ? or the downtime? I have dedicated server running centos 6.0, and apache and the mysql

all of a sudden for some reason server has gone down, so i had to reboot the server and it all worked back to normal, 

However i am wondering how do i get following information, I tried to use "uptime" command this only gives me the time that the server is running what i need to find out is

1. Actual time the server went down ?
2. How long the server has been down ?


...etc 

any ideas?

Assistant: You look through the in files /var/log.

Even if you don't find the errors that caused the outage outright, most of the files will have timestamps so you'll see a big gap in them - from the time the outage started, until you rebooted it.

Of course, this only works if the server actually stopped running - such as a kernel panic.  If it was something like a misconfigured network card, it would still have been writing to the logs.

If it's a fairly busy webserver, you can also look through the access logs to see when it was last accessed before the reboot.
