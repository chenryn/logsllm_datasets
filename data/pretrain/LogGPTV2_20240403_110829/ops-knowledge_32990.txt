User: I have Python 2.7 and 3.4 on my work computer for compatibility reasons with older scripts.
Now I wanted to install "aenum" for Py2.7 but "pip" only installs the package for Py3.4. telling me "aenum-2.0.4-py2-none-any.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform".
In the CMD terminal I changed to the designated Python's "site-packages" folder where it's installed in Py3.4.
"pip" was updated before. pip is installed in both Python folders 
How can I set this up properly?
Assistant: You may have two versions of pip installed i did too and it was a pain but i fixed it myself with the following command: pip2 download/install (enter your package here)
That should fix the issue you have encountered.
