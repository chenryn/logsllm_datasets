TABLE 9 Special Characters in Passwords and Strings
Password Type Special Character Support
Admin and Enable password Admin and enable passwords can contain any ASCII characters in the following ranges:
0x20-0x7e and 0x80-0xFF.
ACOS device hostname Strings for these items can contain any of the following ASCII characters
RADIUS shared secret
a-z A-Z 0-9 - . ( )
SNMPv3 user authentication

RADIUS shared secrets The device hostname can contain any of the following ASCII characters
a-z A-Z 0-9 - . ( )
MD5 passwords for OSPF or MD5 passwords can be up to 16 characters long. A password string can contain any ASCII
BGP characters in the range 0x20-0x7e. The password string can not begin with a blank space,
and can not contain any of the following special characters:
' "  & \ / ?
Passwords used for file All of the characters in the following range are supported: 0x20-0x7E.
import or export
Passwords user for server Most of the characters in the following range are supported: 0x20-0x7E.
access in health monitors
The following characters are not supported:
' "  & \ / ?
SSL certificate passwords Most of the characters in the following ranges are supported: 0x20-0x7E and 0x80-0xFF.
SMTP passwords
The following characters are not supported:
' "  & \ / ?
SMTP passwords
How To Enter Special Characters in the Password String
You can use an opening single-or double-quotation mark without an ending one. In this case, '" becomes ", and "'
becomes '.
Escape sequences are required for a few of the special characters:
• " – To use a double-quotation mark in a string, enter the following: \"
• ? – To use a question mark in a string, enter the following sequence: \077
• \ – To use a back slash in a string, enter another back slash in front of it: \\
For example, to use the string a"b?c\d, enter the following: "a\"b\077c\\d"

aVCS Device Numbers in Commands
The \ character will be interpreted as the start of an escape sequence only if it is enclosed in double quotation marks. (The
ending double quotation mark can be omitted.) If the following characters do not qualify as an escape sequence, they are
take verbatim; for example, \ is taken as \, "\x41" is taken as A (hexadecimal escape), "\101" is taken as A (octal escape),
and "\10" is taken as \10.
NOTE: To use a double-quotation mark as the entire string, "\"". If you enter \", the result is \.
(Using a single character as a password is not recommended.)
It is recommended not to use i18n characters. The character encoding used on the ter-
minal during password change might differ from the character encoding on the termi-
nal used during login.
aVCS Device Numbers in Commands
Some commands either include or support an ACOS Virtual Chassis System (aVCS) device ID. The device ID indicates the
device to which the command applies.
This section contains the following topics:
• Device ID Syntax
• aVCS Device Option for Configuration Commands
• aVCS Device Option for Show Commands
• CLI Message for Commands That Affect Only the Local Device
Device ID Syntax
In an aVCS virtual chassis, configuration items that are device-specific include the device ID. For these items, use the follow-
ing syntax:
• interface ethernet DeviceID/Portnum
• interface ve DeviceID/Portnum
• interface loopback DeviceID/Loopbacknum
• trunk DeviceID/Trunknum
• vlan DeviceID/VLAN-ID
• bpdu-fwd-group DeviceID/VLAN-ID
• bridge-vlan-group DeviceID/VLAN-ID
This format also appears in the running-config and startup-config.
To determine whether a command supports the DeviceID/ syntax, use the CLI help.
The following command accesses the configuration level for Ethernet data port 5 on device 4:

A10 Thunder Series and AX Series—Command Line Interface Reference
aVCS Device Numbers in Commands
ACOS(config)# interface ethernet 4/5
ACOS(config-if:ethernet:4/5)#
aVCS Device Option for Configuration Commands
To configure commands for a specific aVCS device, use the device-context command.
For example, to change the hostname for device 3 in the virtual chassis:
ACOS(config)# device-context 3
ACOS(config)# hostname ACOS3
ACOS3(config)#
aVCS Device Option for Show Commands
To view show output for a specific device in an aVCS cluster, you must use the vcs admin-session-connect command
to connect to the device, then run the desired show command. For example:
For example, the following command shows how to connect to device 2 in a virtual chassis, then view the MAC address table
on that device:
ACOS-device1(config)# vcs admin-session-connect device 2
spawn ssh -l admin 192.168.100.126
The authenticity of host '192.168.100.126 (192.168.100.126)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

CLI Message for Commands That Affect Only the Local Device
You can display a message when entering a configuration command that applies to only the local device. When this option
is enabled, a message is displayed if you enter a configuration command that affects only the local device, and the com-
mand does not explicitly indicate the device.
This enhancement is enabled by default and can not be disabled.

aVCS Device Numbers in Commands
Local Device
The “local device” is the device your CLI session is on.
• If you log directly onto one of the devices in the virtual chassis, that device is the local device. For example, if you log
on through the management IP address of a vBlade, that vBlade is the local device.
• If you change the device context or router content to another ACOS device, that device becomes the local device.
• If you log onto the virtual chassis’ floating IP address, the vMaster is the local device.
Message Example
The following command configures a static MAC address:
ACOS(config)# mac-age-time 444
This operation applied to device 1
This type of configuration change is device-specific. However, the command does not specify the device ID to which to
apply the configuration change. Therefore, the change is applied to the local device. In this example, the local device is
device 1 in the aVCS virtual chassis.
The message is not necessary if you explicitly specify the device, and therefore is not displayed:
ACOS(config)# device-context 2
ACOS(config)# mac-age-time 444 device 2
For commands that access the configuration level for a specific configuration item, the message is displayed only for the
command that accesses the configuration level. For example:
ACOS(config)# interface ethernet 2
This operation applied to device 1
ACOS(config-if:ethernet:2/1)# ip address 1.1.1.1 /24
ACOS(config-if:ethernet:2/1)#
The message is not displayed after the ip address command is entered, because the message is already displayed after
the interface ethernet 2 command is entered.
The same is true for commands at the configuration level for a routing protocol. The message is displayed only for the com-
mand that accesses the configuration level for the protocol.
• In most cases, the message also is displayed following clear commands for device-specific items. An exception is
clear commands for routing information. The message is not displayed following these commands.
• The message is not displayed after show commands.

Enabling Baselining and Rate Calculation
Enabling Baselining and Rate Calculation
The sampling-enable command enhances the information that can be viewed for statistical counters in the system. By
using this command in conjunction with show counters-baselining and show counters-rate, you can obtain
additional counter statistics to help you baseline specific portions of your configuration in order to troubleshoot or improve
performance.
To enable this:
1. Enable the Counters
2. View the Contents of the Counters
Enable the Counters
The sampling-enable command is available at various configuration levels in the CLI. Whenever you see this option, use
the sampling-enable ? command to view the counters for which you can enable baselining.
For example, see the following configuration where a real server is created:
ACOS(config)# slb server s1 2.2.2.2
ACOS(config-real server)# sampling-enable ?
all all
total-conn Total connections
fwd-pkt Forward packets
rev-pkt Reverse packets
peak-conn Peak connections
ACOS(config-real server)# sampling-enable
The counters you will see for the sampling-enable ? command will vary depending on the object. You can select specific
counters you want to enable, or use the all keyword to enable all available counters.
The following example enables baselining for three counters under the SLB server configuration, then verifies the configura-
tion with the show running-config command:
ACOS(config-real server)# sampling-enable total_conn
ACOS(config-real server)# sampling-enable fwd-pkt
ACOS(config-real server)# sampling-enable rev-pkt
ACOS(config-real server)# show running-config | sec slb server
slb server s1 2.2.2.2
sampling-enable total_conn
sampling-enable fwd-pkt
sampling-enable rev-pkt
ACOS(config-real server)#

A10 Thunder Series and AX Series—Command Line Interface Reference
Enabling Baselining and Rate Calculation
View the Contents of the Counters
To view the values of available counters, use the show counters command. This command works the same way even with-
out baselining enabled.
ACOS(config-real server-node port)# show counters slb server s1
Current connections 0
Total connections 189
Forward packets 756
Reverse packets 756
Peak connections 0
ACOS(config-real server-node port)#
The sampling-enable command is used to enable enhanced statistical information:
• View Counter Baseline Information
• View Counter Rate Information
View Counter Baseline Information
To view baseline information, use the show counters-baselining command. Note that only the counters for which
baselining was enabled with the sampling-enable command are listed:
ACOS(config-real server-node port)# show counters-baselining slb server s1
counter_name min max avg
Total Connections 0 189 66
Forward Packets 0 756 264
Reverse Packets 0 756 264
ACOS(config-real server-node port)#
This command shows the minimum, maximum, and average value for each enabled counter over the last 30 seconds.
View Counter Rate Information
To view rate information for each enabled counter, use the show counters-rate command. Note that only the counters
for which rate information was enabled with the sampling-enable command are listed:
ACOS(config-real server-node port)# show counters-rate slb server s1
counter_name 1sec_rate 5sec_rate 10sec_rate 30sec_rate
Total connections 0 0 18 6
Forward packets 0 0 75 25
Reverse packets 0 0 75 25
ACOS(config-real server-node port)#

Tagging Objects
This command shows the average value of each counter over the following intervals:
• last second
• last 5 seconds
• last 10 seconds
• last 30 seconds
Tagging Objects
Certain objects created in the CLI can be tagged by using the user-tag command. These tags can then be searched by
using the aXAPI. See the “Filters” page of the aXAPI Reference for more information.
NOTE: Do not enter the value “Security” for the custom tag from the CLI; this is a reserved key-
word. Doing so can interfere with the proper display of SSLi configurations performed in
the GUI.
Tagging objects is useful to help differentiate objects that can be used for multiple feature areas, like real servers, virtual serv-
ers, service group, or templates. Consider the following example, where multiple real servers are created for load balancing.
By tagging each server, the show running-config output can help you identify which servers are used for FTP load bal-
ancing (labeled with “FTP”) and which ones are used for HTTP load balancing (labeled with “HTTP):
ACOS(config)# slb server ftp1 192.168.1.1
ACOS(config-real server)# user-tag FTP-1
ACOS(config-real server)# exit
ACOS(config)# slb server ftp1 192.168.2.2
ACOS(config-real server)# user-tag FTP-2
ACOS(config-real server)# exit
ACOS(config)# slb server http1 192.168.10.10
ACOS(config-real server)# user-tag HTTP-1
ACOS(config-real server)# exit
ACOS(config)# slb server http2 192.168.20.20
ACOS(config-real server)# user-tag HTTP-2
ACOS(config-real server)# show running-config | sec slb server
slb server ftp1 192.168.1.1
user-tag FTP-1
slb server ftp2 192.168.2.2
user-tag FTP-2
slb server http1 192.168.10.10
user-tag HTTP-1
slb server http2 192.168.20.20

Tagging Objects
user-tag HTTP-2
At a later point in time, suppose server “ftp1” has need to be re-purposed; rather than renaming the server and all of the cor-
responding configuration that might also have “FTP” in their object names, you can update the user tag to indicate the
actual purpose of the server while leaving the existing configuration intact.
Tags can be 1-127 characters in length.

EXEC Commands
The EXEC commands (sometimes referred to as the User EXEC commands) are available at the CLI level that is presented
when you log into the CLI.
The EXEC level command prompt ends with >, as in the following example:
ACOS>
The following commands are available:
• active-partition
• enable
• exit
• gen-server-persist-cookie
• health-test
• help
• no
• ping
• show
• ssh
• telnet
• traceroute
active-partition
Description CLI commands related to ADPs are located in Configuring Application Delivery Partitions.

enable
Description Enter privileged EXEC mode, or any other security level set by a system administrator.
Syntax enable
Mode EXEC
Usage Entering privileged EXEC mode enables the use of privileged commands. Because many of
the privileged commands set operating parameters, privileged access should be password-
protected to prevent unauthorized use. If the system administrator has set a password with
the enable password global configuration command, you are prompted to enter it before
being allowed access to privileged EXEC mode. The password is case sensitive.
The user will enter the default mode of privileged EXEC.
Example In the following example, the user enters privileged EXEC mode using the enable com-
mand. The system prompts the user for a password before allowing access to the privileged
EXEC mode. The password is not printed to the screen. The user then exits back to user EXEC
mode using the disable command. Note that the prompt for user EXEC mode is >, and the
prompt for privileged EXEC mode is #.
ACOS>enable
Password: 
ACOS#disable
ACOS>
exit
Description When used from User EXEC mode, this command closes an active terminal session by log-
ging off the system. In any other mode, it will move the user to the previous configuration
level.
Syntax exit
Mode All
Example In the following example, the exit command is used three times:
1.To move from Global configuration mode to the previous config level (privileged EXEC
mode);
2.To move from privileged EXEC mode to the previous config level (User EXEC mode);
3.From User EXEC mode, the exit command is used to log off (exit the active session):
ACOS(config)#exit
ACOS#exit
ACOS>exit
Are you sure to quit (N/Y)?: Y

gen-server-persist-cookie
Description Generate a cookie for pass-through cookie-persistent SLB sessions.
Syntax gen-server-persist-cookie [cookie-name]
match-type
{
port vport-num rport-num {ipaddr | ipv6 ipv6addr} |
server {ipv4addr | ipv6 ipv6addr} |
service-group group-name vport-num rport-num
{ipv4addr | ipv6 ipv6addr}
}
Parameter Description
cookie-name Name of the cookie header. The default is “sto-id” if no name is specified.
port The port option creates a cookie based on the following format:
cookiename-vportnum-groupname=encoded-ip_encoded-rport
server The server option creates a cookie based on the following format:
cookiename=encoded-ip
service-group The service-group option creates a cookie based on the following format:
cookiename-vportnum-groupname=encoded-ip_encoded-rport
Default ACOS does not have a default pass-through cookie. When you configure one, the default
name is “sto-id”. There is no default match-type setting.
Mode EXEC and Privileged EXEC only
Usage Additional configuration is required. The pass-thru option must be enabled in the cookie-
persistence template bound to the virtual port.
