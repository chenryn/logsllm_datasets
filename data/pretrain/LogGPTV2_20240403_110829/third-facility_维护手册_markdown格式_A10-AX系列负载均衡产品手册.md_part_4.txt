## Special Character Support in Passwords and Strings

The following subsections list the special characters supported for each type of password you can enter in the CLI.

### Supported Password Length
For information about the supported password length, see the CLI help or the command entry in this document.

### Special Characters in Passwords and Strings
| Password Type | Special Character Support |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| **Admin and Enable password** | Admin and enable passwords can contain any ASCII characters in the ranges: 0x20-0x7E and 0x80-0xFF. |
| **ACOS device hostname** | The device hostname can contain the following ASCII characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, - . ( ) |
| **RADIUS shared secret** | RADIUS shared secrets can contain the following ASCII characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, - . ( ) |
| **SNMPv3 user authentication passwords** | SNMPv3 user authentication passwords can contain the same characters as RADIUS shared secrets. |
| **MD5 passwords for OSPF or BGP** | MD5 passwords can be up to 16 characters long and can contain any ASCII characters in the range 0x20-0x7E. The password string cannot begin with a blank space and cannot contain the following special characters: ' " & \ / ? |
| **Passwords used for file import or export** | All characters in the range 0x20-0x7E are supported. |
| **Passwords used for server access in health monitors** | Most characters in the range 0x20-0x7E are supported, except for: ' " & \ / ? |
| **SSL certificate passwords** | Most characters in the ranges 0x20-0x7E and 0x80-0xFF are supported, except for: ' " & \ / ? |
| **SMTP passwords** | Most characters in the range 0x20-0x7E are supported, except for: ' " & \ / ? |

## How To Enter Special Characters in the Password String

You can use an opening single- or double-quotation mark without an ending one. In this case, `'"` becomes `"` and `"'` becomes `'`.

### Escape Sequences
Escape sequences are required for a few of the special characters:
- **"** – To use a double-quotation mark in a string, enter: `\"`
- **?** – To use a question mark in a string, enter: `\077`
- **\** – To use a backslash in a string, enter: `\\`

**Example:**
To use the string `a"b?c\d`, enter: `"a\"b\077c\\d"`

**Note:**
- The `\` character will be interpreted as the start of an escape sequence only if it is enclosed in double quotation marks. If the following characters do not qualify as an escape sequence, they are taken verbatim.
- It is recommended not to use i18n characters. The character encoding used on the terminal during password change might differ from the character encoding on the terminal used during login.

## aVCS Device Numbers in Commands

Some commands either include or support an ACOS Virtual Chassis System (aVCS) device ID. The device ID indicates the device to which the command applies.

### Topics Covered
- [Device ID Syntax](#device-id-syntax)
- [aVCS Device Option for Configuration Commands](#avcs-device-option-for-configuration-commands)
- [aVCS Device Option for Show Commands](#avcs-device-option-for-show-commands)
- [CLI Message for Commands That Affect Only the Local Device](#cli-message-for-commands-that-affect-only-the-local-device)

### Device ID Syntax
In an aVCS virtual chassis, configuration items that are device-specific include the device ID. Use the following syntax:

- `interface ethernet DeviceID/Portnum`
- `interface ve DeviceID/Portnum`
- `interface loopback DeviceID/Loopbacknum`
- `trunk DeviceID/Trunknum`
- `vlan DeviceID/VLAN-ID`
- `bpdu-fwd-group DeviceID/VLAN-ID`
- `bridge-vlan-group DeviceID/VLAN-ID`

This format also appears in the running-config and startup-config. To determine whether a command supports the `DeviceID/` syntax, use the CLI help.

**Example:**
```plaintext
ACOS(config)# interface ethernet 4/5
ACOS(config-if:ethernet:4/5)#
```

### aVCS Device Option for Configuration Commands
To configure commands for a specific aVCS device, use the `device-context` command.

**Example:**
```plaintext
ACOS(config)# device-context 3
ACOS(config)# hostname ACOS3
ACOS3(config)#
```

### aVCS Device Option for Show Commands
To view show output for a specific device in an aVCS cluster, use the `vcs admin-session-connect` command to connect to the device, then run the desired show command.

**Example:**
```plaintext
ACOS-device1(config)# vcs admin-session-connect device 2
spawn ssh -l admin 192.168.100.126
...
ACOS-device2# show mac-address-table
MAC-Address Port Type Index Vlan Age
---------------------------------------------------------
0013.72E3.C773 1 Dynamic 13 2 88
0013.72E3.C775 2 Dynamic 16 10 90
Total active entries: 2 Age time: 300 secs
```

### CLI Message for Commands That Affect Only the Local Device
You can display a message when entering a configuration command that applies to only the local device. This enhancement is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.

**Local Device:**
- The “local device” is the device your CLI session is on.
- If you log directly onto one of the devices in the virtual chassis, that device is the local device.
- If you change the device context or router content to another ACOS device, that device becomes the local device.
- If you log onto the virtual chassis’ floating IP address, the vMaster is the local device.

**Message Example:**
```plaintext
ACOS(config)# mac-age-time 444
This operation applied to device 1
```

## Enabling Baselining and Rate Calculation

The `sampling-enable` command enhances the information that can be viewed for statistical counters in the system. By using this command in conjunction with `show counters-baselining` and `show counters-rate`, you can obtain additional counter statistics to help you baseline specific portions of your configuration to troubleshoot or improve performance.

### Steps to Enable
1. **Enable the Counters**
2. **View the Contents of the Counters**

### Enable the Counters
The `sampling-enable` command is available at various configuration levels in the CLI. Use the `sampling-enable ?` command to view the counters for which you can enable baselining.

**Example:**
```plaintext
ACOS(config)# slb server s1 2.2.2.2
ACOS(config-real server)# sampling-enable ?
all all
total-conn Total connections
fwd-pkt Forward packets
rev-pkt Reverse packets
peak-conn Peak connections
ACOS(config-real server)# sampling-enable total_conn
ACOS(config-real server)# sampling-enable fwd-pkt
ACOS(config-real server)# sampling-enable rev-pkt
ACOS(config-real server)# show running-config | sec slb server
slb server s1 2.2.2.2
sampling-enable total_conn
sampling-enable fwd-pkt
sampling-enable rev-pkt
ACOS(config-real server)#
```

### View the Contents of the Counters
To view the values of available counters, use the `show counters` command.

**Example:**
```plaintext
ACOS(config-real server-node port)# show counters slb server s1
Current connections 0
Total connections 189
Forward packets 756
Reverse packets 756
Peak connections 0
ACOS(config-real server-node port)#
```

### View Counter Baseline Information
To view baseline information, use the `show counters-baselining` command.

**Example:**
```plaintext
ACOS(config-real server-node port)# show counters-baselining slb server s1
counter_name min max avg
Total Connections 0 189 66
Forward Packets 0 756 264
Reverse Packets 0 756 264
ACOS(config-real server-node port)#
```

### View Counter Rate Information
To view rate information for each enabled counter, use the `show counters-rate` command.

**Example:**
```plaintext
ACOS(config-real server-node port)# show counters-rate slb server s1
counter_name 1sec_rate 5sec_rate 10sec_rate 30sec_rate
Total connections 0 0 18 6
Forward packets 0 0 75 25
Reverse packets 0 0 75 25
ACOS(config-real server-node port)#
```

## Tagging Objects

Certain objects created in the CLI can be tagged by using the `user-tag` command. These tags can then be searched using the aXAPI. See the “Filters” page of the aXAPI Reference for more information.

**Note:**
- Do not enter the value “Security” for the custom tag from the CLI; this is a reserved keyword. Doing so can interfere with the proper display of SSLi configurations performed in the GUI.

**Example:**
```plaintext
ACOS(config)# slb server ftp1 192.168.1.1
ACOS(config-real server)# user-tag FTP-1
ACOS(config-real server)# exit
ACOS(config)# slb server ftp2 192.168.2.2
ACOS(config-real server)# user-tag FTP-2
ACOS(config-real server)# exit
ACOS(config)# slb server http1 192.168.10.10
ACOS(config-real server)# user-tag HTTP-1
ACOS(config-real server)# exit
ACOS(config)# slb server http2 192.168.20.20
ACOS(config-real server)# user-tag HTTP-2
ACOS(config-real server)# show running-config | sec slb server
slb server ftp1 192.168.1.1
user-tag FTP-1
slb server ftp2 192.168.2.2
user-tag FTP-2
slb server http1 192.168.10.10
user-tag HTTP-1
slb server http2 192.168.20.20
user-tag HTTP-2
```

Tags can be 1-127 characters in length.

## EXEC Commands

The EXEC commands (sometimes referred to as the User EXEC commands) are available at the CLI level that is presented when you log into the CLI. The EXEC level command prompt ends with `>`, as in the following example: `ACOS>`.

### Available Commands
- `active-partition`
- `enable`
- `exit`
- `gen-server-persist-cookie`
- `health-test`
- `help`
- `no`
- `ping`
- `show`
- `ssh`
- `telnet`
- `traceroute`

### Command Descriptions

#### `active-partition`
Description: CLI commands related to ADPs are located in Configuring Application Delivery Partitions.

#### `enable`
Description: Enter privileged EXEC mode, or any other security level set by a system administrator.
- **Syntax:** `enable`
- **Mode:** EXEC
- **Usage:** Entering privileged EXEC mode enables the use of privileged commands. Because many of the privileged commands set operating parameters, privileged access should be password-protected to prevent unauthorized use. If the system administrator has set a password with the `enable password` global configuration command, you are prompted to enter it before being allowed access to privileged EXEC mode. The password is case sensitive.
- **Example:**
  ```plaintext
  ACOS>enable
  Password: 
  ACOS#disable
  ACOS>
  ```

#### `exit`
Description: When used from User EXEC mode, this command closes an active terminal session by logging off the system. In any other mode, it will move the user to the previous configuration level.
- **Syntax:** `exit`
- **Mode:** All
- **Example:**
  ```plaintext
  ACOS(config)#exit
  ACOS#exit
  ACOS>exit
  Are you sure to quit (N/Y)?: Y
  ```

#### `gen-server-persist-cookie`
Description: Generate a cookie for pass-through cookie-persistent SLB sessions.
- **Syntax:**
  ```plaintext
  gen-server-persist-cookie [cookie-name] match-type
  {
      port vport-num rport-num {ipaddr | ipv6 ipv6addr} |
      server {ipv4addr | ipv6 ipv6addr} |
      service-group group-name vport-num rport-num
      {ipv4addr | ipv6 ipv6addr}
  }
  ```
- **Parameter Description:**
  - `cookie-name`: Name of the cookie header. The default is “sto-id” if no name is specified.
  - `port`: The port option creates a cookie based on the following format: `cookiename-vportnum-groupname=encoded-ip_encoded-rport`
  - `server`: The server option creates a cookie based on the following format: `cookiename=encoded-ip`
  - `service-group`: The service-group option creates a cookie based on the following format: `cookiename-vportnum-groupname=encoded-ip_encoded-rport`
- **Default:** ACOS does not have a default pass-through cookie. When you configure one, the default name is “sto-id”. There is no default match-type setting.
- **Mode:** EXEC and Privileged EXEC only
- **Usage:** Additional configuration is required. The pass-thru option must be enabled in the cookie-persistence template bound to the virtual port.
