User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Windows share - wrong password Disclaimer: I'm completely new to this.

I'm trying to connect to a windows share folder in a different network. When I start remote desktop to the machine with the shared folder, the shared folder works (within the remote desktop: \\DOMAIN\\sharedfolder\ works as expected).

However, if I now try to connect from my own machine, neither the combination user / password, nor DOMAIN\user / password works, and all I get is "The specified network password is not correct".

Is there some magic trick to this? Do I have to type in DOMAIN\password or what?

Assistant: First off, is the same DOMAIN\user account being used to log into the remote desktop session that you are trying to use locally?  You say "different network" so, that's why I ask.  Do you mean different domain entirely?  Or possibly they gave you a local server account to use?

Things to test:


From your machine can you ping the server that you are trying to reach?
If so, can you click start, run, then enter "\SERVERNAME" and hit enter and it then prompts for credentials?


If it does prompt, then you should be able to enter the same credentials you use to start the remote desktop session (paying special attention to the DOMAIN name if it is on a different domain or a local server account ID).

Bottom line:  if you can actually reach the remote server from your PC then whatever credentials you use to login to the remote desktop session should work to get you access to the remote share.
