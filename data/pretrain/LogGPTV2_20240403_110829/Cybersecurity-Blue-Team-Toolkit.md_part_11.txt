same vulnerability and you assume that your fix worked but it didn\'t,
you will have a false sense of confidence in that item and leave
yourself open to attack.
It has been my experience that the IT industry is one of the most
dynamic, with constant change and evolution. There will be times in an
enterprise environment that risky behavior will happen when change
management processes []{#c04.xhtml#Page_46 .pagebreak title="46"
role="doc-pagebreak"}and procedures are not followed. Our networks are
constantly changing and evolving. The networking infrastructure staff
throws a new server with no patches on the domain because the people who
requested it have the authority to bypass security controls. There are
people in the DoD with enough brass on their shoulders to ask for
something like this without understanding the repercussions. Those
assets still need to be scanned, and if they\'re not scanned before
being added to your network, you get to scan them after.
Some organizations I have worked with have compliance needs that require
they scan monthly. Some organizations have a robust security policy
where they require assets to be scanned at least once a week. Either
way, you vulnerability scanning is not just a one‐time action. It is
something that needs to be maintained to ensure your
network/infrastructure is secure.

## OpenVAS {#c04.xhtml#head-2-34}
The Open Vulnerability Assessment System (OpenVAS) is an open‐source
framework of several tools and services that offers powerful
vulnerability scanning and management systems. It was designed to search
for networked devices, accessible ports, and services and then test for
vulnerabilities. It is a competitor to the well‐known Nexpose or Nessus
vulnerability scanning tool. Analyzing the results from tools like these
is an excellent first step for an IT security team working to create a
robust, fully developed picture of their network. These tools can also
be used as part of a more mature IT platform that regularly assesses a
corporate network for vulnerabilities and alerts IT professionals when a
major change or new vulnerability has been introduced.
At the center of this modular service‐oriented product is the OpenVAS
scanner, sometimes called an *engine*. The scanner uses the Network
Vulnerability Tests (NVT) maintained by Greenbone Networks based in
Germany. Greenbone Networks was founded by experts for network security
and free software in 2008 and provides an open‐source solution for
analyzing and managing vulnerabilities, assessing risk, and recommending
an action plan. According to the OpenVAS website, there are more than
50,000 NVTs, and this number is growing weekly.
The OpenVAS Manager is the actual manager of the processes, controlling
the scanner using OpenVAS Transfer Protocol (OTP) and OpenVAS Management
Protocols (OMP). The Manager component schedules scans and manages the
generation of reports. The Manager runs on a SQL database where all the
scan results are stored. The Greenbone Security Manager (GSM) web
application interface is the easiest alternative to the command‐line
client to control the scanner, schedule scans, and view reports. Once
you have OpenVAS installed, you will log in through the Greenbone
Security Assistant, as shown in [Figure
4.2](#c04.xhtml#c04-fig-0002){#c04.xhtml#R_c04-fig-0002}.[]{#c04.xhtml#Page_47

An ISO file is a replication of an entire CD or DVD that you use to
install operating systems or software. Sometimes called an *ISO image*,
you will need this file to deploy the OpenVAS image. Once you have the
OpenVAS `.iso```{=html} file from the website, you can install on
bare metal or in a virtual environment. If you want to install this on a
Linux system, I suggest 16.04. You will need a newly deployed Ubuntu
server, a nonroot user with `sudo```{=html} privileges, and a
static IP address. You also need to know how to use the following
commands:
-   [`sudo apt‐get update ‐y```{=html}]{#c04.xhtml#c04-li-0001}
-   [`sudo apt‐get upgrade ‐y```{=html}]{#c04.xhtml#c04-li-0002}
-   [`sudo reboot```{=html}]{#c04.xhtml#c04-li-0003}
The `sudo```{=html} command is used on Linux systems and means
"superuser do." If you are more familiar with the Windows environment,
`sudo```{=html} is similar to right‐clicking a program and
choosing Run As Administrator. When you add the `‐y```{=html}
option, it will bypass any yes/no prompt with an affirmative answer.
The `apt‐get update```{=html} command will update the list of
available packages and versions. The `apt‐get upgrade```{=html}
command will install the newer versions.
A little like plug‐and‐play in the old days, you need to install the
required dependencies using the following commands:
-   [`sudo apt‐get install python‐software‐properties```{=html}]{#c04.xhtml#c04-li-0004}
-   [`sudo apt‐get install sqlite3```{=html}]{#c04.xhtml#c04-li-0005}
[]{#c04.xhtml#Page_48 .pagebreak title="48" role="doc-pagebreak"}OpenVAS
is not a default in the Ubuntu repository, so to use the personal
package archive (PPA), you must add it, update it, and install it using
the following commands:
-   [`sudo add‐apt‐repository ppa: mrazavi/openvas```{=html}]{#c04.xhtml#c04-li-0006}
-   [`sudo apt‐get update```{=html}]{#c04.xhtml#c04-li-0007}
-   [`sudo apt‐get install openvas```{=html}]{#c04.xhtml#c04-li-0008}
By default, OpenVAS runs on port 443, so you need to allow this through
your firewalls to enable the update of the vulnerability database. The
NVT database contains more than 50,000 NVTs, and this is always growing.
For online synchronization, use the following command:
-   [`sudo openvas‐nvt‐sync```{=html}]{#c04.xhtml#c04-li-0009}
If you skip this step, you will most likely have critical errors later.
If you prefer, you can wait until you launch the program and go to the
Administration feature inside the software to update the vulnerability
database feed. Either way, it must be done.
Once the database is synced, use your browser (preferably Mozilla
Firefox) to log into `https://your static IP address` with the default
credentials *admin*/*admin*. You should then see the OpenVAS Security
Assistant welcome page displayed on your screen, as shown in [Figure
4.3](#c04.xhtml#c04-fig-0003){#c04.xhtml#R_c04-fig-0003}.

The blue star icon is one of the most important buttons on the home
page. It will allow you to add a new object such as the configuration of
a scan or host list. If you are looking to scan just one IP address, you
can use the super‐quick Scan Now button on the home page. To get
familiar with the software, start with one such as in [Figure

As you may have noticed, there are multiple star icons. If you use the
star icon on the right side of the program, you will create a new
filter. To add a list of subnets, use the star icon in the top header of
the Targets page. The process from start to finish will look like
what\'s shown in [Figure
4.5](#c04.xhtml#c04-fig-0005){#c04.xhtml#R_c04-fig-0005}.

1.  [To configure a list of hosts after you\'re done with the one,
    navigate to the Configuration tab. Look for Targets in the header
    portion of the page. This is where you can add a new list of subnets
    of IP address ranges. Please be aware that, depending on the size of
    your subnets of IP address ranges, CIDR notation can occasionally
    error out. You may just need to itemize the list of individual IP
    addresses. Your local host will be listed on the home page by
    default.]{#c04.xhtml#c04-li-0010}
2.  [Name the scan appropriately. I usually try to name the scan in a
    way that allows me to refer to the name and know what I scanned
    rather than some type of numerical name where I have to actually
    open the scan to know what I was thinking at the time. The scanning
    configuration can be left at the default of Full And Fast Ultimate.
    Select your targets and click Create Task. The new task will show up
    with a green bar next to the status of New.]{#c04.xhtml#c04-li-0011}
3.  [When you\'re ready, click the green arrow under Actions to run this
    new task and start your scan.]{#c04.xhtml#c04-li-0012}
4.  [This is the part I love---watching in the task details page. To
    watch the scan live, set the No AutoRefresh option to Refresh Every
    30 Sec. It\'s better than television. Depending on how many targets
    you listed, the scan should be done within a few
    minutes.]{#c04.xhtml#c04-li-0013}
Reporting is vital to your vulnerability management lifecycle. After the
scan has completed, check the summary of scan results. They will be
classified into High, Medium, and Low and will also contain logs. Each
issue that has been []{#c04.xhtml#Page_50 .pagebreak title="50"
role="doc-pagebreak"}discovered will be detailed into vulnerabilities,
impact, affected software, and (my favorite if it\'s available) how to
fix what is broken. You can download and export this file as a
`.pdf```{=html}, `.txt```{=html}, `.xml```{=html},
or `.html```{=html} file.
[Figure 4.6](#c04.xhtml#c04-fig-0006){#c04.xhtml#R_c04-fig-0006} is an
example of filtered results to include in a report. You have the IP
address of the host, what operating system is on the host, and the
security issues and threat level below.

## Nexpose Community {#c04.xhtml#head-2-35}
A lot of organizations offer free or community editions of their
software. These editions are usually a lighter version of the paid copy
with limited features. Once such community vulnerability management
software is Nexpose by Rapid7. There are several versions of Nexpose but
the community version is an excellent place to start learning because
it\'s free. If you search in a browser for "Nexpose Community," one of
the first options should be the community software directly from Rapid7.
You could download from other third parties but I find it safer to
download and verify software directly from the vendor whenever possible.
After you complete the form to receive your community license, you will
end up on a page to download either the Windows or Linux version with
its MD5 sum hash. The hash will verify that your download is not
corrupt. Once the []{#c04.xhtml#Page_51 .pagebreak title="51"
role="doc-pagebreak"}download is finished, run the installer. You will
notice the community version of Nexpose will only work on 64‐bit
architecture. To scan an enterprise for vulnerabilities takes a lot of
resources including CPU and RAM. Historically, 32‐bit architecture can
only recognize 4GB of RAM. Nexpose Community cannot do a proper scan
with only 4GB of RAM.

2.  [You will choose Security Console with local Scan Engine. You will
    see the option for Scan Engine only which gives you the ability to
    deploy scanning engines close to the assets to do the scanning work
    and then bubble that information up to the scan console without
    compromising bandwidth. Nexpose runs on a PostgreSQL 9.4.1 database
    which comes included in the console. Because of the size of most
    environments, the recommended storage for the database is 80GB. The
    console will naturally bind to port 3780, which is important when we
    access the software through the browser through
    https://youripaddress:3780. The PostgreSQL database will communicate
    over 5432 unless you change it at this stage of
