## Steps to Reproduce
Install according to directions on https://flutter.io/docs/get-
started/install/linux
Note the owner and group are unknown (id is 1024). Changed them to root as
they are in the standard android-studio install to attempt to fix.
Problem still is there. Note the bin folder is not available to anyone but
owner 1024 (or root if you attempt to fix install).
