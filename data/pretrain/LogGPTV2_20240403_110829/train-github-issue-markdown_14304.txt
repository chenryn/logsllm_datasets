## Steps to Reproduce

1. Follow the installation instructions provided on the official Flutter website: [Flutter Installation Guide for Linux](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install/linux).

2. During the installation, note that the owner and group of the installed files are set to an unknown user with ID 1024. To attempt a fix, change the ownership to `root` (as is standard in the Android Studio installation). However, this does not resolve the issue.

3. The `bin` folder within the Flutter SDK directory is only accessible to the owner (ID 1024) or `root`. Here is the output of the `ls -al` command for the `/opt/flutter/bin/cache/dart-sdk` directory:

    ```sh
    bessermt@bessermt-Latitude-E6440 /opt/flutter/bin/cache/dart-sdk $ ls -al
    total 40
    drwxr-xr-x  5 root root 4096 Dec  4 09:32 .
    drwxr-xr-x  6 root root 4096 Dec  4 09:33 ..
    drwx------  3 root root 4096 Nov 29 14:16 bin

    drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Nov 19 21:42 include

    -rw-r--r--  1 root root   14 Nov 19 21:42 version
    bessermt@bessermt-Latitude-E6440 /opt/flutter/bin/cache/dart-sdk $
    ```

## Logs

When running the `flutter doctor -v` command, the following error is encountered:

```sh
bessermt@bessermt-Latitude-E6440 /opt/flutter $ flutter doctor -v  
/opt/flutter/bin/flutter: line 177: /opt/flutter/bin/cache/dart-sdk/bin/dart: Permission denied  
bessermt@bessermt-Latitude-E6440 /opt/flutter $
```

This indicates that the `dart` binary in the `bin` directory lacks the necessary execution permissions for the current user.
