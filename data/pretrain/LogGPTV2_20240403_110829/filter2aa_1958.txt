MAELSTROM: AN ATTACK LIFECYCLE GAME CONCEPT 
Maelstrom is a game concept and model meant to enable Education, Demonstration and 
Evangelism within Cyber Security disciplines.  The game concept is intended to span 
from the 8th grade levels to the cyber security Ninja (locked in his mom’s basement). It is 
based on the Lockheed Martin Kill Chain Attack Lifecycle.  The game also borrows 
concepts from several MITRE Frameworks, attack patterns mapped from previous cyber 
campaigns and from real ‘cyber security life’.  The Attacker’s goal is to reach a 
progressive Action on Objective.  The Defenders will play cards, tactics and strategies to 
prevent this progression.   
Pick your side, pick your Actor and pick your Act on Objective, buy or build your own 
cards.  Hope you don’t lose!  ‘Are You Playing with a Full Deck?’ 
OFFICIAL RULES 
CONTENTS: Include a game board (Figure 1), initial game cards for the red Attacker 
Deck, a blue Defender Deck (Figure 2), a green Act on Objective Deck, (optional 
Expansion packs of ‘build your own’ not shown), 2 dice, 9 Actor poker chip game pieces, 
tablets, pens and money. 
Figure 1 MAELSTROM Game Board 
Anatomy of the Maelstrom board consists of multiple stages of an Attack Lifecycle 
(Lockheed Martin based in this case) where the start position for the Attacker is 
Reconnaissance.  The 6 dots between phases indicate positions.  Reconnaissance, 
Weaponization, Delivery, Exploit, Install, Command and Control (C2), Act on Objects 
are each phases in which on the appropriately labeled cards can be played. 
GAME SETUP 
FIRST:  
Pick how many players Attackers 
SECOND:  
Attacker picks or draws their Threat Actor: 
Pick from (12): 
LIST – State Actor, Ware Fighter, Freelance Spy, Script Kiddies, Political/Social, Insider 
Threat, Hacktivist, Disgruntled Employee, Corporate Spy, Criminal Organization, 
Criminal Freelance, Joker  
Attacker does not reveal to the table the choice or draw and places the game piece face 
down on the board on Reconnaissance.  Just like real life where you don’t necessarily 
know the type of Threat Actor you are dealing with. 
THIRD: 
Attacker picks or draws their Act on Objective card 
Pick from (11): 
LIST – Humiliate, Pivot from Shared Space, Blackmail, Denial of Service/Cryptowall, 
Destroy, Data Disclosure, Exfiltration, Plant False Data/Information, Persistent Foothold 
for Future, Defacement/Vandelism, Pick any Act on Objectives Joke  
Does not reveal to the table the choice or draw and places the game piece face 
down in the center of the board on Act on Objectives 
Anatomy of Attacker and Defender Cards: 
Figure 2 Example Attacker Card and Defender Card.  Attacker cards are RED, Defender cards are 
BLUE. 
Text of Card 
The text indicates the phases in which a card can be played. This includes 
Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploit, Install, Command and Control (C2) 
or Act on Objectives.  For instance, this card indicates that it can only be played in the 
Reconnaissance (Recon), Exploit, C2 and Actions phases.   
Progression 
A + or - indicates the progression and the number indicates the steps within a phase a 
player can advance their game piece(s). 
For Ninja play, the players will need to buy their own cards according to a Cost. 
Cost 
For Ninja play, the players will need to maintain their budgets and pay upkeep of the 
value shown and the round frequency shown.  For instance the card above is a $50k 
charge to the attacker for every second round of play to keep using the +4 progression 
through the phases. 
Upkeep is also meant for Ninja play. 
METHOD OF PLAY 
Easy - 8th Grade Level – Quick and Fun! 
2 Players – Role a single dice.  The player with the highest roll decides to be the Attacker 
or Defender.  The other player takes the opposite role.  The Attacker then writes down an 
Action on Objectives (cards coming soon).  The Attacker must build their cards only 
towards this Action on Objectives unless a card in play states otherwise.  The Attacker 
plays with the Attacker cards only and the Defender plays with Defender cards only 
unless a card in play states otherwise  
The Object for the Attacker is to progress through the board until they reach and play the 
appropriate cards/story for their particular Act on Objectives.   
Referring to the Anatomy of the cards,  
7 cards are initially drawn by each player with the Attacker leading the first round.  When 
a player plays a card, the opposite player can then play a follow on card.  The player can 
discard if there are no playable cards in their hand or they wish to discard a card in 
exchange for another.  The rounds continue as each hand is played.   
Story of Play: 
With each card played, the player must supply a one or two sentence description of the 
way in which the card is being played with some ‘fact fiction’ to create the story of play.  
This does require the player to be somewhat versed in the usage and role of the card.  It 
also makes for fun fact fiction!  
Easy to Moderate – College Level – Tactical choices 
Multiple players – Players choice on rolling dice or picking sides.  Players also can pick 
the particular cards they would like in their deck for play.  Keep in mind your 
opponent(s) may be picking tactical cards to defeat the cards you have so pick wisely.   
 Hard (Real Life) - Ninja Level– Strategic choices coupled with realistic challenges 
Multiple players – Players decide their role of Attacker or Defender.  They are then given 
budgets to play with based on a dice role or as mutually (suggest realistically) decided 
between the players.  The budget is a multiplier of 100,000 of the dice player’s dice roll.  
For instance, if a player rolls a 3 then the budget = $300,000.
