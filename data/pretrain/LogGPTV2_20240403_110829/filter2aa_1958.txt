### Overview
Maelstrom is an educational, demonstrative, and evangelistic game concept designed to enhance understanding of cybersecurity disciplines. The game is suitable for players from 8th-grade students to advanced cybersecurity professionals. It is based on the Lockheed Martin Kill Chain Attack Lifecycle and incorporates elements from various MITRE frameworks, attack patterns from previous cyber campaigns, and real-world cybersecurity scenarios.

The objective for the Attacker is to progress through the lifecycle and achieve their Action on Objective. Defenders must use cards, tactics, and strategies to prevent this progression.

### Gameplay
- **Choose Your Side:** Players can be either Attackers or Defenders.
- **Select Your Actor:** Each Attacker picks or draws a Threat Actor (e.g., State Actor, Freelance Spy, Hacktivist, etc.).
- **Define Your Objective:** Each Attacker also selects or draws an Act on Objective card (e.g., Humiliate, Denial of Service, Data Disclosure, etc.).
- **Build Your Deck:** Players can buy or build their own cards to create a unique deck.

### Official Rules

#### Contents
- Maelstrom Game Board (Figure 1)
- Initial Game Cards:
  - Red Attacker Deck
  - Blue Defender Deck
  - Green Act on Objective Deck
- Optional Expansion Packs (for custom decks)
- 2 Dice
- 9 Actor Poker Chip Game Pieces

#### Figure 1: MAELSTROM Game Board
The game board represents the stages of the Attack Lifecycle:
- Reconnaissance
- Weaponization
- Delivery
- Exploit
- Install
- Command and Control (C2)
- Act on Objectives

Each phase has 6 positions, and players move their pieces through these phases using the appropriate cards.

#### Game Setup
1. **Determine Number of Players:**
   - Decide how many players will be Attackers and how many will be Defenders.
   
2. **Select Threat Actor:**
   - Each Attacker picks or draws a Threat Actor from a list of 12 options (e.g., State Actor, Freelance Spy, Hacktivist, etc.).
   - The chosen Actor is kept secret and placed face down on the Reconnaissance phase.

3. **Select Act on Objective:**
   - Each Attacker picks or draws an Act on Objective card from a list of 11 options (e.g., Humiliate, Denial of Service, Data Disclosure, etc.).
   - The chosen Objective is kept secret and placed face down in the center of the board on the Act on Objectives phase.

#### Anatomy of Attacker and Defender Cards (Figure 2)
- **Card Text:** Indicates the phases in which the card can be played (e.g., Reconnaissance, Exploit, C2, etc.).
- **Progression:** A + or - symbol indicates the number of steps a player can advance or retreat within a phase.
- **Cost:** For advanced play, cards have a cost that players must manage within their budget.

#### Method of Play
- **Easy Level (8th Grade):**
  - 2 Players: Roll a single die; the highest roll decides who is the Attacker or Defender.
  - The Attacker writes down their Act on Objective and builds their deck accordingly.
  - Each player draws 7 cards initially, with the Attacker starting the first round.
  - Players take turns playing and discarding cards, creating a narrative as they go.

- **Moderate Level (College):**
  - Multiple Players: Players choose their roles and select specific cards for their decks.
  - Tactical choices are made to counter opponents' strategies.

- **Hard Level (Ninja):**
  - Multiple Players: Roles are decided, and each player is given a budget based on a dice roll (e.g., rolling a 3 gives a $300,000 budget).
  - Strategic choices and realistic challenges are incorporated into the gameplay.
