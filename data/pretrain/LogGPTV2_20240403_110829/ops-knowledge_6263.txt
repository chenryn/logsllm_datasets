User: I want to create a python program that can communicate with another python program running on another machine. They should communicate via network. For me, it's super simple using BasicHTTPServer. I just have to direct my message to http:// server2 : port /my/message and server2 can do whatever action needed based on that message "/my/message". It is also very time-efficient as I do not have to check a file every X seconds or something similar. (My other idea was to put text files via ssh to the remote server and then read that file..)
The downside is, that this is not password protected and not encrypted. I would like to have both, but still keep it that simple to transfer messages.
The machines that are communicating know each other and I can put key files on all those machines.
I also stumbled upon twisted, but it looks rather complicated. Also gevent looks way too complicated with gevent.ssl.SSLsocket, because I have to check for byte length of messages and stuff..
Is there a simple example on how to set something like this up?
Assistant: if you have no problem rolling out a key file to all nodes ...
simply throw your messages into AES, and move the output like you moved the unencrypted messages ...
on the other side ... decrypt, and handle the plaintext like the messages you handled before ...
