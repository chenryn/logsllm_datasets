**Objective:**
I am looking to create a Python program that can communicate with another Python program running on a different machine over a network. The communication should be straightforward and efficient.

**Current Approach:**
Using `http.server` (formerly `BaseHTTPServer`), I can send messages to the other machine by directing them to `http://server2:port/my/message`. This allows `server2` to perform the necessary actions based on the message. This method is highly time-efficient, as it eliminates the need for periodic file checks.

**Alternative Consideration:**
My alternative idea was to use SSH to place text files on the remote server and then read those files. However, this approach is less efficient compared to the HTTP method.

**Security Concerns:**
The current HTTP-based solution lacks both password protection and encryption. I would like to implement these security features while maintaining the simplicity of the message transfer process.

**Machine Configuration:**
The machines involved in the communication are known to each other, and I can distribute key files to all of them.

**Exploration of Other Libraries:**
I have looked into using `Twisted` and `gevent`, but they seem overly complex, especially when dealing with SSL sockets and message byte lengths.

**Request for Assistance:**
Is there a simple example or method to set up a secure and encrypted communication channel between the two Python programs?

**Suggested Solution:**
If you are comfortable distributing a key file to all nodes, you can use AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) to encrypt your messages. Hereâ€™s a high-level overview of how you can achieve this:

1. **Encryption:**
   - Encrypt the message using AES.
   - Send the encrypted message to the remote server as you would with an unencrypted message.

2. **Decryption:**
   - On the receiving end, decrypt the message using the same key.
   - Handle the decrypted plaintext message as you would with the original unencrypted messages.

This approach maintains the simplicity of your current setup while adding the necessary security features.
