A. Gate Delay
B. SRAM Cell
To model the gate delay (tg), VARIUS uses the alpha-
power law (Equation 1), where α is a process parameter
capturing carrier velocity saturation, and µ identiﬁes the
carrier mobility as a function of the temperature (T). This
equation does not model the NTC region accurately. There
are alpha-power law variants [4], [6], [21], [31] that attempt
to extend the model to the subthreshold region. Usually, they
come with an increased number of ﬁtting parameters that
have no direct physical interpretation. Furthermore, that they
cover the subthreshold region does not necessarily imply that
they model NTC properly.
Consequently,
in VARIUS-NTV, we use the EKV-
based [15] model proposed by Markovic et al. [28]. The
formula for the on-current is given in Equation 2, where vt
is the thermal voltage and n a process-dependent parame-
ter determined by subthreshold characteristics. The carrier
mobility’s T dependence is µ ∝ T −1.5.

The resulting gate delay, obtained from CV/I, is shown
in Equation 3. The equation captures the variation in gate
delay as a function of the variation in Vth and Lef f . Since
the EKV model covers all regions of operation, Equation 3 is
equally valid at STC and NTC. In all cases, Vth is a function
of Vdd and temperature as per Equation 4, where Vth0, Vdd0
and T0 are the nominal values of these parameters, and kT
and kDIBL represent constants of proportionality capturing
the impact of T and DIBL (Drain Induced Barrier Lowering)
on Vth, respectively.

VARIUS uses the conventional 6-transistor cell shown
in Figure 4(a). This cell requires careful sizing of the
transistors, since it poses conﬂicting requirements on the
AXR and AXL access transistors to prevent both read and
write failures. While such a design is typical at STC, it
becomes very hard to use at NTC, where transistors are
more sensitive to process variations. One way to address
this problem is to power SRAMs at a higher Vdd than the
logic. Unfortunately, this approach is costly, since cache
memory and logic blocks are often highly interleaved in
the layout. Moreover, it requires extra voltage regulators in
the platform, and results in additional design, validation, and
testing issues. Finally, it is hardly scalable: as we move to
smaller technologies, the relative difference between the safe
SRAM and logic voltages increases, diminishing the power
reduction beneﬁt of NTC.
Consequently, VARIUS-NTV uses the 8-transistor cell of
Figure 4(b) [8], [29]. This cell is easier to design reliably
because it decouples the transistors used for reading (AXRD
and NRD) and those for writing (the rest). Compared to
the 6-transistor cell, read and write timing margins can
be independently optimized with marginal increase in cell
area [8]. In addition, of the ﬁve types of SRAM failure
modes (read timing, read upset, write stability, write timing,
and hold) [30],
this cell eliminates read upset failures
because the cell’s internal nodes are decoupled from the read
bit-line (BL).
C. Memory Failure Modes
While VARIUS only considers read timing failures,
VARIUS-NTV models all of the SRAM failure modes (ex-
cept read upsets, which cannot occur in the 8-transistor cell
because a read cannot ﬂip the cell contents by construction).
We now describe how VARIUS-NTV models them.
1) Hold Failure: In a cell storing 0 (VR = 0, VL = 1), at
low Vdd, the voltage VL decreases by construction. This is

because, when the cell is not accessed, although N L, P R,
and the access transistors are off, there is leakage through
N L and AXL. A hold failure occurs when the leakage
current through the N L and AXL transistors in Figure 4(b)
reduces VL below the VSW IT CH of the P R − N R inverter
while the cell is not being accessed. At that point, the cell’s
state is lost.
To model these failures at a given Vdd, VARIUS-NTV
uses Kirchhoff’s current law to compute VL and VSW IT CH
at Vdd. VL is extracted from IP L(VL) − IN L(VL) −
IAXL(VL) = 0, where

IAXL(VL) ∝ µ/Lef f × T 2 × e− V th
and where Vth in each equation is expressed as a (different)
function of VL.

Similarly, VSW IT CH is extracted from IP R(VSW IT CH)−
IN R(VSW IT CH)+IAXR(VSW IT CH) = 0 for the P R−N R
inverter when VIN = VOU T [30].
The hold failure probability of a cell is PCell,Hold =
P [VL(Vdd) − VSW IT CH(Vdd)  0].
A memory line suffers from write stability failure if there is
at least one cell in the line suffering from it.
3) Read Timing Failure: VARIUS-NTV computes the
random variable that captures the time taken to generate a
detectable voltage drop on the read bit-line as
DV arReadCell ∝
1
IAXRD +(cid:31) IST A
(6)
where IAXRD is the bit-line discharge current through the
AXRD transistor in Figure 4(b), and(cid:31) IST A is the leakage
over all of the cells attached to the bit-line. To calculate the
distribution of 1/IAXRD, ﬁrst, the source voltage of AXRD,
VRD, is extracted by solving the Kirchhoff’s law at this node,
from IAXRD(VRD) = INRD(VRD). When reading from
a cell storing 1 (VR=1 and VL=0), the transistor currents
follow from:
IAXRD ∝ µ/Lef f × n × v2
INRD ∝ µ/Lef f × n × v2

where Vth in each equation is expressed as a (different)
function of VRD.
Then, the probability distribution of DV arReadCell can
be attained by applying those of Vth and Lef f given by
the variation model to
. Following the
VARIUS methodology, the maximum of DV arReadCell over
all of the cells in a line is the time to read an entire memory
line DV arReadLine. Finally, the probability of read access
failure (PReadAccess) is P [DV arReadLine > tREAD], where
tREAD is the designated read duration.

4) Write Timing Failure: Given a cell without write
stability failure, VARIUS-NTV models a write timing failure
by computing DV arW riteCell. This is the time that node L
takes to reach the switching threshold (VSW IT CH) of the
PR-NR inverter. It is:

D. Impact of Leakage
At NTC, the magnitude of the leakage current (Iof f ),
decreases when compared to STC. However, the on-current
(Ion), decreases even more due to lower Vdd. Hence, the
relative impact of Iof f increases. Consequently, unlike VAR-
IUS, VARIUS-NTV takes into account the impact of the
leakage current on SRAM timing and stability, as we have
seen in previous sections. As part of Iof f , we only consider

subthreshold leakage; we exclude gate leakage because we
assume high-K metal gate devices like the ones currently in
use.
IV. MANYCORE ARCHITECTURE MODELED
To evaluate VARIUS-NTV, we model an 11nm manycore
architecture that operates at NTC. The manycore is orga-
nized in tiles (36 in our default conﬁguration) for ease of
design (Figure 5). Each tile has a tile memory and several
cores (8 in our default conﬁguration), each with a per-
core memory. Each core is a single-issue engine where
memory accesses can be overlapped with each other and
with computation. Each tile memory is a bank of a shared
L2 cache, while the per-core memories are L1 caches. Data
in the L1 caches is kept coherent with a directory-based
MESI coherence protocol where each pointer corresponds
to one tile. The cores are connected with a bus inside each
tile and with a 2D torus across tiles. Table I shows the default
architecture and technology parameters. In the table, all of
the parameters that are not labeled with STC refer to the
NTC environment.

VARIUS-NTV.
Manycore
architecture used to evaluate
We evaluate an STC version of the manycore and three
NTC versions of it. The three NTC versions differ based
on the use of voltage and frequency domains, as listed in
Table II.
The technology parameters used in Table I are derived
from ITRS [22] and projected trends from industry. Every
single experiment is repeated for 100 chips with different
variation proﬁles, and we present the average. More samples
beyond 100 do not change the results noticeably.
V. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
We evaluate VARIUS-NTV by using it to estimate the
performance and power consumption of the manycore archi-
tecture of Section IV. We interface Pin [26] over a user-level
pthreads library to the SESC [34] cycle-level architectural
simulator. SESC estimates both execution time and energy
consumed. The energy analysis relies on McPAT [24] scaled
to 11nm. An updated version of HotSpot takes the detailed
CONFIGURATIONS FOR THE NTC MANYCORE.

layout of the chip and models the temperature, in turn affect-
ing the leakage energy in a feedback loop. VARIUS-NTV
is implemented in R [40].
In our experiments, we run multi-programmed workloads
that contain some or all of the following 8 PARSEC applica-
tions: blackscholes, ferret, ﬂuidanimate, raytrace, swaptions,
canneal, dedup, and streamcluster. Each application can run
with 4, 8 or 16 threads. For each application, we measure
the complete parallel section (called Region of Interest or
ROI) running the simsmall input data set.
VI. EVALUATION
In our evaluation, we ﬁrst describe how we set
the
operating voltages and frequencies of the manycore, then
assess the impact of process variations in NTC and STC
environments, and then explore some design parameters.
A. Computing the Operating Point
To determine the operating Vdd and f at NTC, our model
starts with SRAM blocks. Our goal is to estimate VddM IN ,
the minimum sustainable Vdd. It is set by hold and write
stability failure analyses.
Our model ﬁrst ﬁnds the minimum Vdd needed to avoid
hold failures, namely Vdd,hold. The Vdd,hold distribution is
attained by solving VL(Vdd,hold) =V SW IT CH(Vdd,hold),
where the former is the voltage at node L (Figure 4(b)), while

the latter is the switching threshold of the PR-NR inverter.
The chosen Vdd,hold value is obtained at the 3σ of the
distribution — after approximating to a normal distribution.
Our model then proceeds with write stability failure analysis,
to guarantee that
the chosen Vdd,hold also avoids write
stability failures. At this step, a higher Vdd may emerge, if
the write stability failure rate at Vdd,hold remains higher than
the target tolerable error rate. The resulting Vdd is VddM IN .
Once VddM IN is picked, VARIUS-NTV considers timing
issues in order to set the f. The selected f is determined by the
slowest component of the chip, based on our model’s analy-
sis of path delay distributions at VddM IN . For logic blocks,
the analysis follows that of VARIUS [37]. For SRAMs,
it can be shown that, for the parameters considered, write
timing requires longer delays than read timing for the same
Vdd. This is consistent with the work of Abella et al. [1].
Hence, write timing analysis determines the path delays in
each SRAM block. To determine the maximum path delay,
VARIUS-NTV approximates the path delay distributions to
normal ones and picks the 3σ cut-off point. This maximum
delay determines the f at VddM IN .
B. Impact of Process Variations at NTC and STC
To examine the impact of WID process variations on the f
and power consumption at NTC and STC, we consider three
types of on-chip blocks separately: logic (the core pipelines),
small memories (the per-core local memories) and large
