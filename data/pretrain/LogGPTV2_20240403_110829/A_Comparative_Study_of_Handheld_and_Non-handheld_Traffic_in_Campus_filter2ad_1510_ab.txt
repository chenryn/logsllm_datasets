Fig. 1. CDFs of TCP ﬂow properties (Net1)
We observe that handhelds tend to have smaller ﬂow sizes than non-handhelds.
Figure 1a shows the median handheld ﬂow size is 50 KB, versus 100 KB for non-
handhelds. At the lower tail, there are fewer small ﬂows for non-handhelds than hand-
helds; at the upper tail, the maximum ﬂow size is larger for non-handhelds (2 GB) than

handhelds (630 MB). The smaller handheld ﬂow sizes are expected, as many content
providers serve simpler or compressed content to mobile devices.
Handhelds and non-handhelds also differ in their distribution of ﬂow duration. Fig-
ure 1b shows the median ﬂow duration is approximately the same for both device types,
but handhelds have a narrower range of ﬂow durations. The middle 80% of handheld
ﬂows are 250ms to 15s long, compared to a range of 100ms to 75s for non-handhelds.
The lack of long handheld ﬂows can be attributed to typically short usage sessions [5].
We also look at ﬂow durations for a few speciﬁc applications (full data in [7]). On aver-
age, web ﬂows are 5x shorter for handhelds, which we suspect is caused by handhelds
being served simpliﬁed versions of many web pages. For email trafﬁc, receiving pro-
tocols (IMAP, POP) have shorter average ﬂows on non-handhelds, while the sending
protocol (SMTP) has shorter ﬂows on handhelds. We hypothesize the discrepancy in
SMTP is caused by a higher likelihood of non-handheld users including attachments.
Downlink ﬂow rates are shown in Figure 1c. Both device types have the same median
rate of 10 Kbps, but only 10% of handheld ﬂows are slower than 1 Kbps compared to
30% of non-handheld ﬂows. Other factors associated with ﬂow rate are consistent across
both device types: (i) the average round trip time for 90% of TCP ﬂows is less than
100 ms; (ii) only 4% of ﬂows have one or more retransmissions due to retransmission
time out, and 1% of ﬂows have one or more retransmissions due to fast retransmit.
Comparing duration and size of ﬂows (not shown), we observe for both device types that
small ﬂows tend to have long durations, while large ﬂows tend to have short durations.
4 Web Trafﬁc
Web trafﬁc accounts for almost all handheld data (97%) and a large fraction of non-
handheld data (82%). HTTP is used so commonly because of its wide interoperability
and support for many types of content. Web usage differs between device types because
of differences in the way individuals use these devices. We see variation in (i) the range
and type of hosts accessed and (ii) the type and length of content. We also observe that
82% of handheld HTTP trafﬁc is consumed by non-browser applications, compared to
10% of non-handheld. Most notably, we see a higher usage of HTTP-based streaming
media services on handhelds: video accounts for 42% of handheld HTTP content, ver-
sus only 23% for non-handhelds. Our analysis excludes partial HTTP streams (due to
improper reassembly) and all data from the Net2 traces (due to anonymity concerns).
4.1 Hosts
HTTP hostnames, in combination with the type of content they provide, give a rough
understanding of the types of services accessed by clients. Table 4 lists the top HTTP
hosts based on the size (content-length) of the data served to the devices. We observe
that handhelds access more multimedia content (by volume) than non-handhelds. Over
35% of handheld HTTP content originates from googlevideo.com, followed by
18% originating from pandora.com. Multimedia-type content is also the most fre-
quent for eight of the top ten handheld hosts. In total, the top 10 handheld hosts account
for 74% of handheld data, while the top 10 non-handheld hosts account for 42% of
178

non-handheld data. These percentages indicate a much greater diversity in hosts for non-
handheld devices. In addition, non-handheld devices are more likely to receive content
from hosts providing more than text or multimedia content. For example, a Microsoft
site hosting application downloads, dlservice.microsoft.com, appears in the
top non-handheld hosts with application/octet-stream as the primary content type.
We also look at the top hosts based on number of HTTP requests (listed in [7]). The
top 10 handheld hosts account for 30% of handheld HTTP requests, compared to 32%
for non-handhelds. Also, there is a greater diversity of services in the top hosts by re-
quests: social networking, streaming media, advertising, search, and news. In summary,
both device types have a great diversity in the number of hosts they request data from,
but handhelds receive most of their data (by volume) from a much smaller set of hosts.
4.2 Content Type and Length
The type of HTTP content accessed by devices further identiﬁes the services used and
highlights differences in trafﬁc characteristics. We observe the largest volume of hand-
held content is video (42%), while images are the top type for non-handhelds (29%)
(full data in [7]). Below, we discuss each of the MIME types in detail.

Application content is data associated with speciﬁc applications, e.g. documents,
compressed ﬁles, or streaming media. For both device types, octet-stream—a simple
binary data stream—is the most common subtype, accounting for 86% of handheld
and 51% of non-handheld application type data. The average octet-stream is 713 KB
for handhelds (σ = 882 KB) and 189 KB for non-handhelds (σ = 658 KB). The second
most common application subtype is RSS feeds for handhelds and Shockwave Flash for
non-handhelds. No handhelds access Shockwave Flash content because these devices
did not support Flash until very recently [1]. Over 185 different application subtypes are
accessed by non-handhelds compared to only 58 subtypes for handhelds. This variety
results from the greater diversity of applications running on non-handheld devices.
The content for regular web browsing falls mostly into the image and text content
types. Three image subtypes—gif, jpg, and png—make up the majority of image con-
tent, with JPG images being the largest (average of 13 KB for handhelds and 11 KB for

non-handhelds). HTML, CSS, JavaScript and XML are used for the web page itself. For
both device types these text subtypes average 3-7 KB in length. Over two-thirds of the
text content received by handhelds is plain text. This content is destined for non-browser
applications retrieving data from a web service, e.g. a sports scores application.
The remaining MIME content types are multimedia trafﬁc, namely audio and video.
Multimedia accounts for 46% of handheld content and 29% of non-handheld content.
In particular, video accounts for 93% of multimedia trafﬁc in the handheld case and
80% in the non-handheld case. We examine video trafﬁc in greater detail next.
4.3 Streaming Video
Streaming video is a major source of trafﬁc for handheld devices. Video content ac-
counts for 40% of all handheld trafﬁc, compared to only 17% of all non-handheld trafﬁc.
We compare the ﬂow characteristics of handheld streaming video, non-handheld video,
and all handheld ﬂows to understand the differences in handheld streaming media.
As expected, handheld video ﬂows are large compared to overall handheld trafﬁc:
80% of video ﬂows are > 50 KB in size, whereas 50 KB is the median among all
handheld ﬂows (Figure 2a). Nearly 20% of handheld video ﬂows are > 1 MB in size,
with a 400 KB median. Non-handheld video ﬂows are even larger, with a 3 MB median.
