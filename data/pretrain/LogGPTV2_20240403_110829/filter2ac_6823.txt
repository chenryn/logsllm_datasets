### Title: Black Hat US-22 Keynote: 25 Years of Black Hat: Where Do We Go from Here?

For the past 25 years, the information security (InfoSec) community and industry have convened in the desert to address the vulnerabilities in the technologies we use daily. Through continuous vulnerability research and insights into adversary tactics, we have made significant strides. Simultaneously, vendors and software firms have introduced new products and protections.

As we reflect on the last 25 years and look ahead to the next 25, a critical question arises: Are we on the right path? The answer is not straightforward. Society's relentless and often pathological drive to connect everything has continually expanded the attack surface, making it easier for malicious actors to exploit vulnerabilities. Business decisions that prioritize convenience over security continue to create challenges for network defenders.

Moreover, external factors such as global market dynamics and shifting geopolitical landscapes can upend carefully crafted business plans and national strategies almost overnight. The recent years of geopolitical instability and the rise of autocratic regimes may seem like a relatively stable period by the end of the 2020s.

This talk will delve into current risk trends and their implications for future network defenders. It will also propose necessary shifts in mindset and action to achieve better outcomes, acknowledging that we will always operate in a contested information environment. To paraphrase Mitch Hedberg (RIP), perhaps over the next 25 years, we can build a safer, more resilient technological future where systems and infrastructure, when they fail, degrade gracefullyâ€”much like how an escalator turns into stairs when it breaks down.
