User: How to manage infrastructure with multiple hosts using Ansible
Assistant: Using Ansible to manage the infrastructure of multiple hosts requires the following steps: 1. Install Ansible software on the Ansible control node and configure SSH authentication. 2. Write an Ansible playbook on the Ansible control node to define the resources and configuration of the infrastructure. 3. Configure Ansible inventory on the Ansible control node to define the information and organizational structure of the managed hosts. 4. Run the Ansible playbook and use the playbook and inventory files on the Ansible control node to manage multiple hosts. In Ansible playbook, you can define resources such as software installations, configuration files, users, keys, etc., and specify which host group or all hosts to apply these resources on. You can also use Ansible playbook modules, such as copy and template, to perform various tasks on managed hosts. In Ansible inventory, you need to list all managed hosts and group them. Ansible users can use the group name to specify which resources to apply to which hosts. Finally, you can send commands to Ansible using the command line, or you can use tools like Ansible Tower. Ansible Tower has a GUI and API to help you better manage your infrastructure.
