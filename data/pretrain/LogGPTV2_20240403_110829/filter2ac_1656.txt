**ATT&CK ID:** T1547.010  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Port Monitors

Adversaries may leverage port monitors to execute a malicious DLL during system boot, thereby achieving persistence or privilege escalation. A port monitor can be configured using the `AddMonitor` API call to specify a DLL that will be loaded at startup. This DLL is typically placed in the `C:\Windows\System32` directory and is loaded by the print spooler service, `spoolsv.exe`, when the system boots. The `spoolsv.exe` process runs with SYSTEM-level permissions, which can be exploited for elevated access.

Alternatively, an adversary can load an arbitrary DLL if they have the necessary permissions to write the fully-qualified pathname of the DLL to the registry key `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Monitors`.
