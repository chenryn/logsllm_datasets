**Current behavior**
If you have a lot of form controls in template and compile with AOT, webpack
build will hang for a long time or seemingly never complete.
In the below demo of the bug, I have 20 form controls on a template, it will
take about 2 minutes to build after compile. If you delete 5 of them, it only
take 12 seconds to compile.  
If you have 30 controls in total, it will hang for an extremely long time or
never complete.
**Expected behavior**
It should be able to compile in a reasonable amount of time regardless of how
many form controls used.
**Reproduction of the problem**
As this is something that can't be reproduced on plunker, I've created a
minimal repo that demonstrates the bug:
https://github.com/qdouble/aot-form-controls-build-bug
To demo the bug, just clone the github repo and run `npm i` to install.  
To compile and build files, run `npm run compile`.  
To create a normal build without ngc, just use `npm run build`.  
To start server, use `npm run prodserver`.
**Please tell us about your environment:**
  * **Angular version:** 2.0.0-angular-builds
  * **Language:** [TypeScript X.X]
  * **Node (for AoT issues):** `node --version` = 6.5.0
