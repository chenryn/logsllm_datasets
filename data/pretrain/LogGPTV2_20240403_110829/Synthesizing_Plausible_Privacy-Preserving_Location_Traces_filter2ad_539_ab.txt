where the nodes are locations and the weight of the edges
is the average semantic similarity between the locations over
the dataset.
C. Forming Location Semantic Classes
The location semantic graph enables us to infer which
locations have similar meanings (or purpose) for different
people. The locations that have higher semantic similarity
can be grouped together to represent one location semantic
class. We run a clustering algorithm on the location semantic
graph to partition locations into distinct classes. Regardless
of their geographic positions, the locations that fall into the
same class are visited in the same way by different people.
In other words, their visit probability, time of visit, and the
probabilities of transition from/to them to/from other locations
with the same type is similar. Thus, we can consider them
as being semantically equivalent. So, using the notations of
our previous example, wA and wB should belong to the
same cluster that can represent “workplace” locations, and hA
and hB should be grouped into another cluster representing
residential or “home” locations.
D. Synthesizing a Trace
We use the location semantic classes as the basis to generate
synthetic traces. In addition to being semantically realistic, the
fake traces must be geographically consistent with the general
mobility of individuals in the considered area. For example,
the speed of moving between locations and the duration time
of staying in a location depend on the time of the day or
the probabilities of different paths that cross those locations.
To capture these patterns, we compute an aggregate mobility
model from the traces in the seed dataset by averaging their
corresponding mobility models.
The goal is to synthesize traces that are semantically similar
to real traces. To this end, our algorithm starts with a seed trace
and converts it to a probabilistically generated semantically
similar synthetic trace which is consistent with the aggregate
mobility model. We ﬁrst transform the geographic seed trace
into the semantic domain, then we use the transformed seman-
tic trace to sample from the domain of all geographic traces
that could have been transformed to the same semantic trace.
The transformation and sampling procedures, which are at the
heart of this step, are done as follows.
In the transformation process, we replace the geographic
locations in the seed with the locations that are in the
same semantic class. This semantic trace is a sequence of
location sets. For sampling a synthetic trace, we address the
following problem. We want to construct a trace that follows
the aggregate mobility model under the constraint that its
locations over time are a subset of locations of the seed
semantic trace. Hence, both the synthetic trace and the seed
trace can be transformed to the same semantic trace. This
makes the synthetic trace semantically plausible. We add some
randomness to the locations in the semantic trace to increase
the ﬂexibility of our algorithm. Many methods can be used to
sample the fake trace that satisﬁes our constraints. We make
use of dynamic programming algorithms that construct the
traces efﬁciently (see Section V).
We can repeatedly generate synthetic traces from each
seed trace in the dataset, each of which having a probability
according to the aggregate mobility model. After generating
each trace, however, we need to make sure that it is not
geographically similar to the seed trace. This is because we
do not want to leak information about the real seed trace. To
this end, we add a test to compute the geographic similarity
between the seed trace and the fake trace to reject the sample
traces that are more similar than a threshold to the seed trace.
Thus, we make sure that the semantically similar synthetic
traces are indeed geographically dissimilar to the traces in our
dataset, hence do not leak information about visited locations
in the real traces. We also ensure that the semantics of a
synthetic trace do not leak about a seed trace more than what
they leak about alternative traces (which are not among the
seeds and our algorithm is independent of). To this end, we
run the plausible deniability privacy test (see Section V).
IV. MOBILITY SIMILARITY METRICS
In this section, we present a probabilistic model for mobility,
and propose two metrics to analyze the geographic and seman-
tic similarity between two mobility models. Table I presents
the list of notations that we use in this paper.
A. Mobility Model
We model the user mobility as a time-dependent ﬁrst-order
Markov chain on the set of regions (locations). As users
have different activities and mobility patterns during different
periods of time, we assume that time is partitioned into time
periods, e.g., morning - afternoon - evening - night. So, the
mobility proﬁle (cid:5)p(u), π(u)(cid:6) of a given user u is a transition
probability matrix of the Markov chain associated with the
user’s mobility (from a region to another), and the user’s
visiting probability distribution over the regions, respectively.
Note that these probabilities are dependent on each other, and
together they constitute the joint probability of two regions
(cid:2)
that are subsequently visited by the user. The entry pr
(cid:2) (u)
(cid:2) in
r,τ,τ
of p(u) is the probability that user u will move to region r
(cid:2)), given
the next time instant (which will be in time period τ

τ (u)
is the probability that user u is in region r in time period τ.
We can compute π(u) from traces or directly from p(u) (in
some circumstances). Let the random variable At
u represent
the actual location of user u at time t, and τ t be the time
period associated with At
u. So, the mobility proﬁle of a given
user u consists of the following probabilities:

This Markovian model can predict the location of an in-
dividual to a great extent, as it takes both location and time
aspects into account. It can become even more precise, by
increasing its order, or by enriching its state. Our framework
can incorporate new dimensions similar to the way we model
the time periods. To learn the probabilities of the mobility
proﬁle (1), from location traces, we can use maximum like-
lihood estimation (if the traces are complete) or make use of
algorithms such as Gibbs sampling (if the traces have missing
locations or are noisy) [46].

B. Mobility Similarity Metrics
We propose two metrics to compare the mobility of two
users and compute their similarities: geographic and semantic
similarity. In this subsection, we describe the intuition behind
these metrics, and in the following subsections, we formally
deﬁne and provide the algorithms to compute them.
The geographic similarity metric captures the correlation
between location traces that are generated by two mobility
proﬁles. It reﬂects if two users visit similar locations over
time with similar probabilities and if they move between those
locations also with similar probabilities. Using this metric, for
example, two individuals who live in the same region A and
their workplace is in the same region B potentially have very
550550
similar mobilities, as they spend their work hours in B and
most of their evenings in A.
The geographic similarity between the mobility models
of two random individuals is usually low. However, if we
ignore their exact visited locations, they tend to share similar
patterns for visiting locations with similar semantics (locations
therein they have similar activities). Consider the semantic
dimension of locations as a coloring of them on the map.
Besides the geographic correlation between location traces,
we can compute their correlation at the semantic level too
(by reducing the set of locations to colors and computing
the similarity of colored traces). This is the intuition behind
our semantic similarity metric. In this case, if the pair of
locations that two individuals visit over time have the same
semantic, their mobility models are also semantically similar
(even if they do not intersect geographically). For example,
if we transform trace X by replacing its locations with their
corresponding semantically similar locations in trace Y, the
transformed trace becomes statistically similar to Y. So, two
traces are semantically similar if their locations can be mapped
(translated) to each other in this way.
C. Geographic Similarity Metric
We deﬁne this similarity metric based on the Earth Mover’s
Distance (EMD) for probability distributions. The EMD is
widely used in a range of applications [43], [44], and can
be understood by thinking of the two distributions as piles of
dirt where it represents the minimum amount of work needed
to turn one pile of dirt (i.e., one distribution) into the other;
the cost of moving dirt being proportional to both the amount
of dirt and the distance to the destination. The special case
of EMD for probability distributions has been shown to be
equivalent to the Mallows distance [27].
Let X and Y be discrete random variables with probability
distributions p and q, such that Pr{X = xi} = pi and
Pr{Y = yi} = qi, respectively, for i = 1, 2, . . . , n. We also
have
Deﬁnition 1. (From [27]) Let d(·) be an arbitrary distance
function between X and Y. The Mallows distance Md(p, q)
is deﬁned as the minimum expected distance between X and
Y with respect to d(·) and to any joint distribution function
f for (X, Y) such that p and q are the marginal distributions
of X and Y, respectively.

computed by expressing the optimization problem as a linear
program.

Using the previous deﬁnition, we deﬁne the geographic
similarity metric based on the Mallows distance.
Deﬁnition 2. Let d(·) be an arbitrary distance function. The
dissimilarity between two mobility proﬁles (cid:5)p(u), π(u)(cid:6) and
(cid:5)p(v), π(v)(cid:6) (belonging to individuals u and v), is deﬁned as
the expected Mallows distance of the next random locations
r(cid:2) and r(cid:2)(cid:2) according to the mobility proﬁles of u and v,
respectively. More formally, it is

where pr(cid:2)
(cid:2) (v) denote the conditional prob-
ability distributions of the next location, given the current
location and the current and next time periods. The Mallows
function is computed over random variables r(cid:2) and r(cid:2)(cid:2), and
the expectation is computed over random variable r and time
periods τ and τ
(cid:2).
We deﬁne the geographic similarity between mobility pat-
terns of u and v as
simG(u, v) = 1 − E[Md(pr(cid:2)
r,τ,τ
(cid:2) (u), pr(cid:2)(cid:2)
zg

(cid:2) (v))]
,
(5)
where zg is a normalization constant equal to the maximum
value of (the expectation of) the Mallows distance given d(·),
ensuring that the geographic similarity always lie in [0, 1].
We compute the geographic dissimilarity using the law of
total expectation. This also clariﬁes its meaning by showing
more directly the role of the random variables.

This is simply the average, for each time and location, of
the EMD between the distributions of the next location of u
and v. So, for each current location (and time), we use the
EMD to compute the dissimilarity between the distributions
representing the next locations of users u and v, respectively.
The current location is taken according to user u’s mobility
proﬁle, making this deﬁnition asymmetric.
For a particular distance function d(·), the Mallows distance
deﬁnition can be expanded and previous expressions can be
further simpliﬁed. This is the case for d(i, j) = 1i(cid:5)=j, for
which Md(p, q), for arbitrary probability distributions p and
q, has closed form 1 − (cid:2)
Using the dissimilarity metric, we can compute the geo-
graphic similarity between the mobility proﬁles (cid:5)p(u), π(u)(cid:6)
and (cid:5)p(v), π(v)(cid:6), for any distance function (e.g., hamming dis-
tance, Euclidean distance). For example, considering hamming
distance d(r, r

We emphasize that this deﬁnition leads to an asymmetrical
similarity measure, i.e., the similarity of u to v need not be the
same as the similarity of v to u. In principle, this metric can
551551
also be computed using measures other than EMD. For exam-
ple, one can use Kullback-Leibler divergence measure [11] to
compute the difference between two probability distributions,
ignoring the distance between the locations. We emphasize that
we use EMD, in our geographic similarity metric, as we also
want to include the distance function d(·) between locations
in computing the difference between two mobility models.
