**Current behavior**
Angular API reference states that there is only a `required` ValidatorFn in
the class `Validators` but source code defines required, requiredTrue,
compose, composeAsync, email and null.
**Expected behavior**
API reference reflects the Validators defined.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**
Compare Angular API reference and Validators class source.
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
Fixing an error in documentation.
