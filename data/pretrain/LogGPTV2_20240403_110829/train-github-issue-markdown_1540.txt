This may be a bit of an obvious question, but I am not really a javascript
man...
Anyway, I am using the Collapse plugin for an accordion, but I want to make
the toggle links gain a class of "active" when toggled, which the Button
plugin does. But I seem to have a choice between using 'data-
toggle="collapse"', which makes the accordion work, or using 'data-
toggle="button"', which makes the button plugin work, but I can't use both. Is
there a way to get the button toggle to work alongside the collapse toggle?
