C FULL GRAMMAR FOR THE REQUEST
HEADERS EXPERIMENT
The request headers experiment tests all standard HTTP request
headers together with numerous valid values. Listing 20 shows the
full grammar where an expansion for every 67 header is defined. In
addition, we present expansions for sub-elements of each header.
