User: Please provide a security hardening plan for the Linux server and explain the necessity of each hardening measure.
Assistant: 1. Auditing user accounts and rights management 1. Necessity of disabling unnecessary system user accounts: Disabling unnecessary system user accounts can reduce the risk of system security vulnerabilities and prevent hackers from exploiting passive vulnerabilities. 2. The necessity of reasonably assigning permissions: In the Linux system, user permissions are a key factor in controlling security. Reasonable distribution of user rights can reduce the possibility of being exploited by hackers to obtain management rights. 3. Modify the default account name and password. Necessity: The default account name and password are easily guessed by hackers. After modification, the possibility of the system being compromised can be reduced. 2. Reinforce SSH service 1. Necessity of modifying SSH port number: The default port 22 is vulnerable to brute force attack, modifying the port can reduce the probability of being attacked. 2. Necessity of configuring SSH login restrictions: Configuring SSH login restrictions can restrict unauthorized remote logins and enhance system security. 3. The necessity of installing a firewall to restrict SSH external connections: Installing a firewall can restrict SSH external connections to avoid remote attacks by hackers. 3. Prohibition of remote login with root password 1. Necessity of prohibiting remote login with root password: remote login with root password is easy to be attacked by hackers, so remote login with root password is prohibited, and only other accounts can be used to log in to the system to improve system security. Fourth, configure SELinux protection 1. Enable SELinux and configure the correct strategy Necessity: Enabling SELinux enforces access control, which can control the system at a fine-grained level and limit various system attacks. 2. Necessity of closing SELinux Booleans: SELinux Booleans installed by default usually contains unsafe settings, which need to be closed to avoid risks. 5. Enable system log and audit 1. Necessity of regularly clearing system logs: Regularly clear system logs to prevent log files from being used by hackers, especially when the root account is abused. 2. Necessity of setting system log and audit strategy: Setting the strategy of system log can better trace system security management, audit control and vulnerability analysis. Sixth, install the intrusion detection system 1. The necessity of installing the intrusion detection system: the installation of the intrusion detection system can find the loopholes of the system in time and maintain the security of the system. 7. Other security hardening solutions 1. Necessity of prohibiting ping requests: Prohibiting ping requests can reduce the probability of system being attacked. 2. Hardware MAC address filtering. Necessity: Hardware MAC address filtering can limit the access of unsafe devices and protect the security of the system network. 3. Necessity of regularly updating system patches: Regularly updating system patches can fix system vulnerabilities and enhance system security.
