User:  Deploy Nginx on a Linux server, configure reverse proxy and load balancing. Please give an example of Nginx configuration file.
Assistant: Below is an example of a basic Nginx configuration file for reverse proxying and load balancing. ``` # Define the load balancing backend server upstream backend { server backend1.example.com; server backend2.example.com; server backend3.example.com; } # Configure HTTP server server { # Listening port number, can be 80 Or other ports listen 80; # Perform reverse proxy based on the requested domain name server_name example.com; # Configure a reverse proxy to forward the request to the backend server location / { proxy_pass http://backend; } } ``` in this In the example, we define a backend server group named backend, which contains three servers. Then we configured an HTTP server, listening on port 80, and performing reverse proxy based on the requested domain name example.com. All requests are forwarded to the backend server group http://backend and load balanced by Nginx.
