# Inbound Connection Attempts and Spam Sources Analysis

## 1. Introduction
This document provides an in-depth analysis of inbound connection attempts to a monitoring network, focusing on the identification and behavior of spam sources. The data spans from December 2000 to February 2004, with a particular emphasis on the increasing prevalence of spam and the effectiveness of DNS-based blacklists (DNSBLs) in mitigating it.

## 2. Data Summary
The following table summarizes the number of inbound connection attempts and their corresponding dates:

### Figure 1: Number of Inbound Connection Attempts
- **Description**: This figure shows the number of inbound connection attempts made by each remote Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) to the monitoring network.
- **Sorting**: Remote MTAs are sorted by the decreasing number of connection attempts.
- **Axes**: Both X and Y axes are in log scale.

## 3. Analysis of Spam Sources

### 3.1 Inbound SMTP Connections
- **Observation**: Approximately 56% of inbound SMTP connection attempts in February 2004 were rejected by local hosts.
- **Reason**: These local hosts were not running an MTA and thus immediately reset the connections.
- **Comparison**: This percentage increased from less than 13% in 2000.

### 3.2 Classification of Spam Sources
- **Criterion**: A remote host is classified as a spam source if it attempted to connect to a local host that was not running an MTA and there were no successful mail transfers initiated from any local host to that remote host.
- **Spam Traps**: Local hosts that do not accept or initiate SMTP connections effectively serve as spam traps, allowing the identification of likely spam sources.
- **Example**: One such host, which had previously been relaying emails for a defunct domain, received 141,917 SMTP connections from 7,732 remote hosts on 20 February 2004. All messages sent to this host were confirmed to be spam using SpamAssassin.

### Table 4: Classification of Remote Hosts
| Date       | Local Spam Traps | Remote Spam Sources |
|------------|------------------|---------------------|
| 7 Dec 2000 | 19               | 79                  |
| 8 Dec 2000 | 89               | 66                  |
| 19 Feb 2004 | 90               | 7,970               |
| 20 Feb 2004 | 59               | 8,780               |

### 3.3 Distribution of Connection Attempts
- **Observation**: The distribution of connection attempts from remote spam hosts in 2004 follows a Zipf-like distribution, unlike in 2000.
- **Zipf Parameter**: The tail of the distribution in 2004 can be approximated with a Zipf-like distribution with α = 1.03.
- **Implication**: There has been a significant increase in the number of low-profile spam sources, making them harder to identify and block.

### Figure 2: Number of Inbound Connection Attempts by Spam Sources
- **Description**: This figure shows the number of inbound connection attempts made by spam sources, sorted by the decreasing number of connection attempts.
- **Distribution**: The 2004 set follows a Zipf-like distribution, while the 2000 set does not.

## 4. Effectiveness of DNSBLs

### 4.1 Coverage and Overlap
- **Coverage**: The coverage of different DNSBLs varies widely. For example, SpamHaus lists about 87% fewer hosts than more aggressive lists like SORBS.
- **Overlap**: There is little overlap between known spam sources and open relay lists. However, different open relay lists are highly correlated.

## 5. Summary and Future Work

### 5.1 Summary
- **Increase in DNSBL Usage**: The use of DNSBLs at CSAIL increased dramatically from December 2000 to February 2004, with DNSBL lookups now accounting for nearly 14% of all DNS lookups.
- **Spam Source Activity**: The activity distribution of spam source hosts became Zipf-like with α = 1.03 in 2004, and 80% of these hosts were found to be listed in blacklists two months after the trace was collected.

### 5.2 Future Work
- **Better Understanding**: Further research to better understand the distribution of active spam sources.
- **False Positive and Miss Rates**: Assessing the false positive rate and miss rate of DNSBLs.
- **Algorithm Development**: Devising a prescriptive algorithm for using a set of DNSBLs to block spam effectively.
