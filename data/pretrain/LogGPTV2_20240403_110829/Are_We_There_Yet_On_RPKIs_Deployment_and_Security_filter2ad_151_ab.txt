RPKI RCs form a certiﬁcation hierarchy as follows. At the
top of the hierarchy are the ﬁve Regional Internet Registries
(RIRs). Each RIR holds a root (self-signed) RC covering all IP
addresses in its geographical region. Organizations that were
allocated an IP preﬁx directly by an RIR can request the RIR to
issue them an RC, validating their ownership of the IP preﬁx.
For example, Deutsche Telekom in Figure 1 was certiﬁed by
RIPE for its address space 91.0.0.0/10.
In case of that ownership was later delagated, that is, if an
organization A further allocated a subpreﬁx to organization B,
then A is responsible for certifying B as the owner for that
subpreﬁx. Of course, to accomplish this, A must itself possess
an RC for its assigned IP addresses.
As explained above, once an organization holds an RC,
it can issue a ROA to protect its IP preﬁxes from hijacks.1
ROAs specify an IP preﬁx, the number of the AS authorized
to advertise that IP preﬁx in BGP, and the maximum-length
of subpreﬁxes the speciﬁed AS may advertise. Figure 1 shows
that Deutsche Telekom used its RC to issue a ROA so as to
protect its IP preﬁx against hijacking.
1Actually, the owner issues an end-entity (EE) certiﬁcate for an ephemeral
one-time-use key, which is used to sign the ROA [38, Section 2.3]. The ROA
and EE cert are stored together, so we have treated them as one object.

to identify and discard BGP route-
advertisements that violate ROAs. Namely, advertisements
where the destination IP preﬁx is not mapped to the origin
AS speciﬁed in the ROA. A local cache machine at the AS
periodically syncs with the RPKI database to retrieve RCs and
ROAs, validating them from the root of the RPKI hierarchy
to its leaves. Valid ROAs mapping IP preﬁxes to ASes are
then used to generate whitelists which BGP routers in that
AS pull from the cache periodically using the RPKI-to-Router
protocol [10]. See Figure 2. With cryptographic operations
outsourced to the cache machine, routers can enforce ROV
without changes to their hardware or BGP-message handling
architecture (routers supported conﬁguration of ﬁlters to BGP
messages long before RPKI).
Upon receiving a BGP route-advertisement, the BGP router
checks whether the advertised destination IP preﬁx p is “cov-
ered” by a ROA, that is, whether there exists a ROA for a
superpreﬁx P ⊇ p. The route-advertisement is then assigned
one of following three states:
•
•
Unknown: p is not covered by any ROA.
Valid: p is covered by a ROA, the origin AS number
matches AS number speciﬁed in the ROA and the
IP preﬁx is no longer than the maximum length
speciﬁed in the ROA (e.g., see Deutsche Telekom’s
advertisement in Figure 1).
Invalid: Otherwise (p is covered, but not “valid”).
•
Routers use this state assignment to realize route-ﬁltering
policies. The default action for most routers is to discard
invalid routes (e.g., see [14], [35]) and this is also the
considered best practice [21] (RFC7454 states that routers
SHOULD discard invalid routes). However, an ROV-enforcing
AS may instead choose to conﬁgure its router to merely de-
prefer invalid routes over other routes. Indeed, our survey ﬁnds
that some operators do this (see Section III). However, as
observed in [17], [28], de-preferring invalid routes leaves the
AS completely vulnerable to subpreﬁx hijacking. We therefore
focus our attention henceforth only on ROV adopters that
discard invalid routes.

arrows) and valid/unknown route advertisements (marked by
black arrows), to ﬁnd ASes that do not enforce ROV (marked
in red) and ROV-enforcing ASes (marked in green).
III. ROV ADOPTION STATUS
Route Origin Validation (ROV), deﬁned in RFC 6483 [32],
allows BGP routers to prevent preﬁx hijacking by detecting
that an incoming BGP advertisement is inconsistent with ROAs
in RPKI. Major vendors support ROV in their BGP routers
with negligible computational overhead (e.g., see [14], [35]).
Hence, deploying ROV involves only a modest, one-time
installation effort, and no signiﬁcant operational expenses. We
present the ﬁrst measurements of ROV adoption, showing that
it is very limited, in particular at the core of the Internet. To
complement and support our measurements, we also surveyed
over 100 network practitioners about ROV adoption in their
networks.
A. Quantifying ROV Adoption
While measurements regarding the issuing of ROAs exist,
e.g., [47], [57], we are unaware of any previous measurement
of ROV adoption. Indeed, measuring adoption of ROV by ASes
seems challenging: how can we tell if a BGP router performs
ROV or not? We identiﬁed a way to gain empirical insights
regarding the extent to which ROV is adopted by leveraging
invalid BGP route-advertisements, i.e., advertisements that are
incompatible with ROAs (see Section II-B). We ﬁrst explain
our measurement techniques and then discuss our results.
Identifying ASes that do not enforce ROV. We examine BGP
paths from the multiple vantage points afforded by 44 Route
Views sensors [54] and identify ASes that propagate BGP-
path advertisements that are classiﬁed as “invalid” according
to RPKI (see red nodes in Figure 3).2 We conclude that these
ASes do not enforce ROV (at least not for all invalid IP
preﬁxes). Of course, this measurement identiﬁes only non-
adopting ASes. When an AS does not appear in any of the
received announcements, this might not be due to ROV but to
other reasons, e.g., its BGP paths to the relevant IP preﬁxes
did not propagate to the vantage points. Hence, our results set
a lower bound on ROV non-adoption.
Identifying ASes that enforce ROV. To identify ASes that do
enforce ROV, we apply the following methodology. We seek an
AS that originates both a BGP-route advertisement that is not
invalid (i.e., is classiﬁed as either valid or unknown by RPKI,
2We excluded advertisements from the same AS as the Route Views sensor,
or from its customers, since these might not be subject to ﬁltering.

tion (ROV)?
see the black arrows in Figure 3) and an invalid BGP adver-
tisement, like the origin AS in Figure 3. Intuitively, we then
check which ASes discarded the invalid route-advertisement
from that AS but relayed the other advertisement from the
same AS. Speciﬁcally, we check whether there is only one
transit AS on the non-invalid advertisement’s route that did
not relay any invalid route-advertisement (see green node in
Figure 3).3 We categorize an AS as ROV-enforcing if it meets
the above criterion with respect to three different destination
ASes.
Results. Our measurement techniques, as described above,
provide a view on the state of ROV enforcement amongst the
ASes at the core of the Internet (since these are likely to be
on the paths observed by the Route Views sensors). Figure 4
shows the results for the top 100 ISPs (ordered by the number
of the customer ASes). We ﬁnd that almost all of the top 100
ISPs do not enforce ROV. Speciﬁcally, we found only one AS
of the top 20 ISPs that enforces ROV, and at least 78 of the
top 100 ISPs do not enforce ROV. In fact, we found only 9
of the top 100 ISPs enforce ROV. Note that 13 of the top 100
ISPs could not be classiﬁed by our method (as captured by the
grey line in Figure 4).
3Since the BGP decision process at an AS is often identical across different
destination IP preﬁxes in the same AS, this approach is likely to identify ASes
that ﬁltered the invalid advertisement and propagated the valid one.

B. Survey Results
To complement and corroborate the above results, we
conducted an anonymous survey of over 100 network se-
curity practitioners. Our survey was conducted by sending
requests over different mailing lists, including ‘closed’ lists
(where membership is limited only to recognized practition-
ers).4 Among participants 80% were network operators or
managers and most others were security/networking consul-
tants, Appendix A provides additional characterization of the
participants.
We asked survey participants whether and how they apply
RPKI-based ROV in their BGP routers. Figure 5 illustrates our
results. Over 84% of responses indicate not enforcing ROV
at all. Less than 6% of the participants reported enforcing
ROV. A larger fraction of the participants (over 10%) reported
assigning lower preference to BGP route-advertisements whose
ROV validation status is “invalid”. As described in Section II,
this adoption mode leaves adopters completely vulnerable to
subpreﬁx hijacks.
IV. SECURITY IN PARTIAL ADOPTION
The measurement results in Section III invite the following
question: What is the impact of partial ROV deployment on
security?
A. Collateral Beneﬁt and Damage
We identify collateral beneﬁt and collateral damage effects
that greatly impact the security of ROV in partial deployment.
The scenarios in Figure 6 illustrate these effects, which we
next describe.
Collateral beneﬁt. ROV allows adopting ASes to pro-
tect the ASes “behind” them by blocking malicious route-
advertisements even if these ASes do not perform ROV them-
4We believe that the results are biased, to some degree, in the direction of
stronger security and adoption, since expert and security-aware operators are
more likely to participate in such forums and to respond.
selves. To see this, consider the simple network depicted in
Figure 6a. Suppose that AS 1 is the legitimate owner of preﬁx
1.1/16, issued a ROA protecting this IP preﬁx, and advertises
this IP preﬁx in BGP. Suppose also that AS 2 enforces ROV
and all other ASes do not. Now, consider the scenario that an
attacker, AS 666, announces the subpreﬁx 1.1.1/24. AS 2 will
discard the false route-advertisement from 666 and, in doing
so, also protect AS 3. We refer to this as a collateral beneﬁt
from ROV enforcement.
Collateral damage. In contrast, an AS that does not apply
ROV can cause ROV-enforcers to get disconnected from the
victim or, surprisingly, have their trafﬁc forwarded to the
attacker. We describe such scenarios using the same network
topology as before, only now we assume that AS 3 rather than
AS 2 performs ROV.
A BGP-speaking router only advertises one route per
preﬁx to neighboring ASes. Assume that the attacker performs
preﬁx hijacking, i.e., advertises the same preﬁx as the victim.
AS 3 that enforces ROV will automatically discard BGP route
advertisements that are inconsistent with ROAs. If its provider
(AS 2) advertises the attacker’s invalid route advertisement,
then AS 3 will disconnect from the legitimate origin (AS 1).
See Figure 6b.
While AS 3 may be disconnected from legitimate desti-
nations, it may seem that its data trafﬁc to such IP preﬁxes
will never reach illegitimate destinations (i.e., preﬁx hijackers)
since it discards invalid routes. To see why this is incorrect
consider the same network but when the attacker performs a
subpreﬁx hijack, as described in Figure 6c. AS 2, which does
not apply ROV, will fall victim to the attack and select the
direct BGP path to AS 666 for IP preﬁx 1.1.1/24 and the direct
BGP path to AS 1 for the larger IP preﬁx 1.1/16. (Recall that,
under BGP, routes to every destination IP preﬁx are computed
independently.) Upon receiving the corresponding two BGP
route-advertisements from AS 2, AS 3 will detect the attack
and discard the route-advertisement for 1.1.1/24. Consequently,
all packets from AS 1 to addresses in IP preﬁx 1.1.1/24 will
