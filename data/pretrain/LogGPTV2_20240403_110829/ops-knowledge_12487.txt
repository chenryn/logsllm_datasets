User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Windows Performance Monitor keeps trying to add unwanted counters I have been running a Data Collector Set for SQL Server for a week, and everything was going just fine until I tried clicking on Action -> Save Current View and now it always tries to add the following counters automatically to my reports:

\\MYSERVER\Provedor de Dados .NET para SqlServer(sqllogship[1296])\NumberOfInactiveConnectionPools
\\MYSERVER\Provedor de Dados .NET para SqlServer(sqllogship[1296])\NumberOfNonPooledConnections
\\MYSERVER\Provedor de Dados .NET para SqlServer(sqllogship[1296])\NumberOfPooledConnections
\\MYSERVER\Provedor de Dados .NET para SqlServer(sqllogship[1624])\NumberOfInactiveConnectionPools
\\MYSERVER\Provedor de Dados .NET para SqlServer(sqllogship[1624])\NumberOfNonPooledConnections
\\MYSERVER\Provedor de Dados .NET para SqlServer(sqllogship[1624])\NumberOfPooledConnections
\\MYSERVER\Provedor de Dados .NET para SqlServer(sqllogship[1744])\NumberOfInactiveConnectionPools
\\MYSERVER\Provedor de Dados .NET para SqlServer(sqllogship[1744])\NumberOfNonPooledConnections
\\MYSERVER\Provedor de Dados .NET para SqlServer(sqllogship[1744])\NumberOfPooledConnections
\\MYSERVER\Provedor de Dados .NET para SqlServer(sqllogship[2008])\NumberOfInactiveConnectionPools


And this causes a lot of annoying error messages (one for each counter listed above) saying:


  One or more of the selected counters are already present and won't be
  added again.


How do I prevent those counters from being automatically (re-) added everytime I select a report?

Thanks.

Assistant: You have created a Current View. As such, whenever you open a report in Performance Monitor it will attempt to add those performance counters to any log you open. If they already exist you'll receive this error message. 

To fix this problem do the following


Open a saved report and clear the error messages
Right click on one of your performance counters select "Remove All Counters"
Hit OK when it asks if you are sure you want to remove all added counters
Click "Action"
Click "Save Current View"


Problem Fixed.
