User: On a Red hat box, I upgraded Python from 2.3 to 2.6.4 and changed the symlink to python so when I type in python the 2.6.4 interpreter comes up.
However my .py file works from the command-line, but not in the browser. It seemed like a sys.path issue so I opened the file in a browser and printed out sys.path.
Surprisingly, my sys.path is different when called from a browser than when called from a command-line. Because the paths are all referring to 2.3, I believe Apache is picking up Python 2.3 rather than the new 2.6.4 version I installed. 
How do I make Apache use Python 2.6.4?
Assistant: Apache isn't calling python directly, so the path is irrelevant. You will probably want to build yourself a new mod_wsgi to link against python 2.6.4.
