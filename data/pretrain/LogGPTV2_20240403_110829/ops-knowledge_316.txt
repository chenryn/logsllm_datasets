User: I need to redirect my clients to another endpoint in my django app.  I know I can use relative urls with request.build_absolute_uri() to do this, but I am searching for a generic solution that doesn't require the redirecting handler to know its own place in the URL hierarchy.  
As an example, I have handlers at the following two URLs:
https://example.com/some/other/namespace/MY_APP/endpoint_one
https://example.com/some/other/namespace/MY_APP/foo/bar/endpoint_two
Both handlers need to redirect to this URL:
https://example.com/some/other/namespace/MY_APP/baz/destination_endpoint
I would like for endpoint_one and endpoint_two to both be able to use the exact same logic to redirect to destination_endpoint.
My app has no knowledge of the /some/other/namespaces/ part of the URL, and that part of the URL can change depending on the deployment (or might not be there at all in a development environment).
I know I could use different relative urls from each endpoint, and redirect to the destination URL.  However, that required that the handlers for endpoint_one and endpoint_two know their relative position in the URL hierarchy, which is something I am trying to avoid.
Assistant: After doing more research and talking with coworkers, I realized that reverse does exactly what I need.
