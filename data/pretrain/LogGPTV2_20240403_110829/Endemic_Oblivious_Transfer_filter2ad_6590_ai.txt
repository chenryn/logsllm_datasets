The remaining two implications, from uniform security to receiver chosen message security and
from sender chosen message security to endemic security follow in a similar fashion. Again it is
easier to construct a malicious receiver interacting with the ideal OT when he can choose the OT
strings rather than receiving them from the ideal OT.

In the following, we give a generalized deﬁnition of OT.
Deﬁnition A.13 (Generalize Ideal k-out-of-n Oblivious Transfer). A (generalized) ideal k-out-of-n
oblivious transfer is a functionality that interacts with two parties, a sender S and a receiver R.
Let S ⊆ [n] of size k and s1, ..., sn ∈ {0, 1}(cid:96).
The functionality is publicly parameterized by one of the following message sampling methods:
Sender Chosen Message: S sends the circuit M : [n] → {0, 1}(cid:96) to the functionality which
deﬁnes si := M(i).
Receiver Chosen Message: R sends the circuit M : [k] → {0, 1}(cid:96) to the functionality which
deﬁnes sSi := M(i) for i ∈ [k] and uniformly samples si ← {0, 1}(cid:96) for i ∈ S \ [n].
Uniform Message: The functionality uniformly samples si ← {0, 1}(cid:96) for i ∈ [n].
Endemic: If S is corrupt, then S sends the circuit M : [n] → {0, 1}(cid:96) to the functionality which
deﬁnes si := M(i).
If R is corrupt, R sends the circuit M : [k] → {0, 1}(cid:96) to the functionality which deﬁnes
sSi := M(i) for i ∈ [k].
All remaining si for i ∈ [n] are uniformly samples si ← {0, 1}(cid:96).
The functionality is publicly parameterized by one of the following selection methods:
Receiver Selection: R sends the circuit S : [n] → {0, 1} to the functionality where the support
of S is of size k. The functionality deﬁnes S := {i | S(i) = 1}.
Uniform Selection: The functionality uniformly samples S ← P([n]) s.t. |S| = k.
As speciﬁed by the message sampling method, the oracle receives the circuit M from the appro-
priate party if one is called for. As speciﬁed by the selection method, the functionality receives the
circuit S if one is called for. Thereafter, upon receiving the message (Output, i) from S, respond
with si. Upon receiving (Output, i) from R and if i ∈ S, respond with si.

Remark A.14. When n is polynomial in the security parameter κ, we simplify the above deﬁnition
to Deﬁnition 2.4 to allow the parties directly input the appropriate si messages as opposed to
specifying a circuit M. Similarly for the set S := {i | S(i) = 1}. Lastly, instead of querying the
oracle with (Output, i), the oracle sends (si)i∈[n] to S and (S, (si)i∈S) to R. This simpliﬁcation
can trivially be simulated when n = poly(κ).
The following transformation allows to transform an OT where the receiver’s choice bit is
chosen to an OT with a random choice bit. This transformation is very useful in the context of OT
extension.

B Lower Bound on the Round Complexity of Sender and Receiver
Chosen Message Security
In Lemma 3.8, we state that there cannot be an two message OT that achieves sender chosen
message security where the sender sends its message ﬁrst. Here we give the proof.
Proof. We show that the most general notion of OT, one out of two OT is impossible. For a two
message OT where the sender sends its message ﬁrst, the sender’s message mS is a function fS on
input tS and some auxiliary input aux. A sender could sample s0, s1 during the protocol or receive
them as input. We use aux to cover the second case. Further, there is a function fR that takes the
random tape tR, mS and choice bit b of R. Finally, there are two functions fOT,S(tS, mR, aux) that
outputs (s0, s1) and fOT,R(tR, mS, b) that outputs sb.
First, we assume that S is committed to (s0, s1) given mS, i.e. there is a (s0, s1) such that
Pr
mR,(tS,aux)
[fOT,S(tS, mR, aux) = (s0, s1) | mS = fS(tS, aux)] ≥ 3

.
In this case, a malicious receiver can break the security as follows. It selects two random tapes
tR,1, tR,2, two choice bits b1 = 0, b2 = 1 and computes for all i ∈ [2], mR,i = fR(tR,i, mS, bi) and
sbi,i = fOT,R(tR,i, mS, bi). It outputs (s0,1, s1,2) as a guess for s0, s1.
34
Let the scheme be δ correct, for δ ≥ 1 − negl. Then, the probability that the ﬁrst malicious
receiver reconstructs (s0, s1) correctly is lower bounded using Jensen’s inequality by
Pr[(s0,1, s1,2) = (s0, s1)] ≥

where (s0, s1) = fOT,S(tS, mR, aux). A malicious receiver interacting with the ideal OT can achieve
this at most with probability 1
2 . Hence, there is a distinguisher that breaks the sender chosen
message security of the OT.
Now assume that for any (s0, s1),
[fOT,S(tS, mR, aux) = (s0, s1) | mS = fS(tS, aux)] <
Pr
mR,tS

(1)
In this case, we show that a malicious receiver can tweak the distribution of s0, s1. The malicious
receiver uses a hardwired pseudorandom function (PRF) key k for a PRF PRF that outputs a single
bit.7 The malicious receiver samples two random tapes tR,1, tR,2, two uniform choice bits b1, b2,
computes for all i ∈ [2] mR,i = fR(tR,i, mS, bi) and sbi,i = fOT,R(tR,i, mS, bi). If PRFk(sb1,1) = 0 it
sends mR,1 to S and outputs sb1,1 otherwise it sends mR,2 to S and outputs sb2,2
We ﬁrst give a bound on the probability that PRFk(sbi,i) = 0. Let PRF be a probability such
that
Pr[PRFk(sbi,i) = 0] =
− PRF.

Then there is a distinguisher D that simply outputs 1 if PRFk(sbi,i) = 0. Hence,
| Pr[D(1κ, sbi,i, PRFk(sbi,i)) = 1] − Pr[D(1κ, sbi,i, u) = 1]| = PRF,
where u ← {0, 1}. Since D breaks PRF with probability PRF and PRF is secure, PRF is negligible.

Since the OT is δ = 1 − negl correct, we get by using a union bound that the malicious receivers

output sbi,i is correct and PRFk(sbi,i) = 0 holds at least with probability 1
PRFk(sbi,i) = 0 holds with a noticeable bias - given k- when the malicious receiver interacts with
an honest sender. If there is a distribution of (s0, s1) from which the ideal OT samples with the
same bias, then there is a distinguisher D that breaks the security of PRF. D samples from this
distribution, queries PRF on the samples and outputs 1 if the query returns 0.
Since there is no such a distribution for a secure PRF, there is no adversary A(cid:48) that creates
the same output distribution when interacting with the ideal OT as when the malicious receiver
interacts with the honest sender. Hence, the OT is not sender chosen message secure.

7OT implies one-way functions and hence also PRFs.

The following proof is the proof for Lemma 3.9, which states that there cannot be an two
message OT that achieves receiver chosen message security where the receiver sends its message
ﬁrst.
Proof. Again, we rule out the most general notion of OT, one out of two OT. We follow a similar
strategy as in the previous lemma. A two message OT where the receiver sends its message ﬁrst
has the following structure. The receiver’s message mR is a function fR on input tR, b and some
auxiliary input aux. Further, there is a function fS that takes the random tape tS and mR as input.
Finally, there are two functions fOT,S(tS, mR) that outputs (s0, s1) and fOT,R(tR, mS, b, aux) that
outputs sb.
We distinguish two cases. In case one, we assume that R is committed to sb given mR, i.e. there
is a sb such that
