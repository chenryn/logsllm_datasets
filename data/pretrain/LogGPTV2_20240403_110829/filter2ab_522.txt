**ATT&CK ID:** T1552.002  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Credentials in Registry

Adversaries may search the Windows Registry on compromised systems for insecurely stored credentials. The Windows Registry is a hierarchical database that stores configuration settings and options for the operating system and applications. Adversaries often query the Registry to locate credentials and passwords that have been saved for use by other programs or services. These credentials can be used for various purposes, including automated logons.

### Key Points:
- **Registry Functionality:** The Windows Registry contains configuration information essential for the system and other software.
- **Adversary Behavior:** Adversaries look for stored credentials within the Registry, which can be used for unauthorized access or automation.
- **Common Use Cases:** Stored credentials may be utilized for automatic logons, enabling adversaries to maintain persistent access or perform lateral movement.

By understanding and monitoring these activities, organizations can better protect their systems from such credential theft techniques.
