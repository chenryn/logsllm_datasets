### Improving the Accuracy of Results

To enhance the accuracy of the results, this approach is based on the methodologies proposed by [Dong et al., 2005] and [Aleman-Meza et al., 2006]. However, applying weights to relationships within an ontology requires human review. An automated approach to address this problem involves the following steps:

1. **Concept Comparison**:
   - At each iteration of the algorithm, compare a concept related to the original service concept with one related to the original client concept.
   - For example, in the first iteration, compare the "Physician" concept related to "ER Doctor" from the client ontology with a concept related to "Emergency Room Physician (ERP)" in the service ontology.
   - This process continues, and the "Physician" concept related to ERP is identified, as shown in Figure 14 (1).
   - After the algorithm terminates, three concepts related to "ER Doctor" are found to be similar or equivalent to the concepts related to "ERP."

2. **Advanced String Comparison**:
   - To expand the approach, consider comparing the names of the concepts and the relationship types using an advanced string comparison algorithm, such as n-grams [Damashek, 1995].
   - This method returns a decimal value between 0 and 1, which can be used to create a weighted score and a threshold for predicting authorization.
   - Although this approach uses syntactic comparison, it leverages semantic information from the schema to exploit relationships, concept names, and relationship names, as well as the number of relationships.

3. **SWRL Rules**:
   - Another approach is to create SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) rules that capture relationship information about a resource while being general enough to apply to an entire class.
   - For instance, a rule could state that a "Radiology Tech" belonging to the same department as another "Radiology Technician" are equivalent concepts.
   - However, this approach may result in a high number of false positives and would require extensive rules and prior knowledge of the ontology, especially in less structured domains like HL7.

### Other Approaches to Consider

Authorization in web services is a significant research area, with WS-Authorization being one of the few remaining specifications to be standardized [IBM, Microsoft 2002]. In the Semantic Web and Semantic Web Services, research on Semantic Authorization is rapidly growing.

- **Access Control Enforcement**:
  - Some previous research has focused on implementing access control enforcement structures [Yague et al., 2003].
  - [López et al., 2005] discusses an approach using XACML and SAML for access control in distributed heterogeneous networks, with the novelty of converting between these standards for policy enforcement.
  - [Agarwal et al., 2004] uses attributes from credentials like SAML or Digital Certificates for access control decisions, though these credentials were designed for authentication.

- **Ontology-Based Authorization**:
  - [Kagal et al., 2004] uses ontologies to add authorization annotations to OWL-S, which adds semantics to web services through a mapping of concepts in OWL-S to WSDL types.
  - A hybrid approach incorporating real-world concepts with rule-based ontologies is described in [Kagal et al., 2004], providing greater expressiveness by incorporating the semantics of rules.

- **Extending Standards**:
  - When developing a system, it is important not to reinvent the wheel. For example, extending the accepted standard WSP by adding semantic annotations is better than creating an entirely new standard.
  - Using the RBAC standard for annotation schemes and ontologies is also recommended, as it is an accepted standard.

### Policy Matching in Semantic Web Services

- **Semantic Policy Matching**:
  - [Verma et al., 2005] details an implementation using SWRL for Semantic Policy matching.
  - [Wu et al., 2002] describes how to incorporate access control in business processes (workflows), highlighting the need for semantic expression of authorization and access control.
  - [Anyanwu et al., 2003] examines complex processes in healthcare applications in heterogeneous cross-domain environments.

### Questions for Discussion

**Beginner:**
1. Why are traditional web services authorization techniques not adequate for Semantic discovery?
2. Why is the concept of Roles important in Semantic Authorization?

**Intermediate:**
1. How could independent enterprises exchange their authorization ontologies with those enterprises that have discovered their web services?
2. What security risks are involved with placing the ontologies on the internet?
3. Can you think of a solution that would alleviate the security risk mentioned in the previous question?

**Advanced:**
1. Discuss some of the relationships between RBAC concepts and a real-world enterprise. How could these relationships be exploited in securing Semantic Web services?
2. Can you think of any ways that semantics could benefit the security technologies currently in use, such as authentication and encryption? What kind of ontology would you design to do this?
