to improve the accuracy of the results. This approach is based on [Dong et
al., 2005] and [Aleman-Menza et al., 2006]. However, applying weights
requires a human to review the relationships within the ontology. An
automated approach to the problem of weighting the relationships is as
follows.

Client Concept ‘ER Doctor’ Service Concept ‘Emergency
Room Physician’
Figure 16 Concept Comparison
At each iteration of an algorithm, compare a concept related to the
original service concept with one related to the original client concept. For
example, in the first iteration compare the Physician concept related to ER
Doctor from the client ontology to a concept related to Emergency Room
Physician(ERP) in the service ontology. This continues and the concept
Physician related to ERP is found, Figure 14 (1). As shown in the figure,
after the algorithm terminates, we have found three concepts related to ER
Doctor that are similar, if not equivalent to, the concepts related to ERP.
This is a simplistic example because the names of the relating concepts are
the same. However, if names of the related concepts are not the same this
approach can be expanded upon.
Consider expanding the approach by comparing the names of the
concepts as well as the relationship type through an advanced string
comparison algorithm. We suggest the n-grams [Damashek, 1995]
algorithm to compare the labels of the related concepts and the relationships,
i.e. Physician and instanceOf respectively. By using a string comparison
that returns a decimal between 0 and 1, one could create a weighted score
and a threshold for predicting authorization. This approach, although using
syntactic comparison, uses semantics from the schema to exploit
relationships to other concepts, concepts names, and relationship names; as
well the number of relationships.
Another approach to consider is to create SWRL (Semantic Web Rule
Language) rules that are specific enough to capture relationship information
regarding a resource but general enough to be applicable to an entire class.
For example, we could have created a rule that a technician, like ‘Radiology

Tech, belonging to the same department, ‘Radiology.’, as another technician,
‘Radiology Technician, and are therefore equivalent concepts. However,
this approach may result in an unacceptable amount of false positives and in
a domain less structured than the HL7 domain, it would require many rules
and a priori knowledge of the ontology.
5. OTHER APPROACHES TO MENTION
Authorization in Web services is currently a research area of great
interest. WS-Authorization is one of a few Web service specifications
remaining to be standardized [IBM, Microsoft 2002]. In the Semantic realm,
including both Semantic Web and Semantic Web services, research interests
in Semantic Authorization are rapidly growing.
Some previous research regarding authorization in Semantic Web
services has been focused on implementing an access control enforcement
structure [Yague et al., 2003]. [López et al., 2005] discusses an approach to
access control in a distributed heterogeneous network in which XACML and
SAML are used for access control. The novelty of their approach is to
convert between these standards for the enforcement of policies.
[Agarwal et al., 2004] uses attributes from credentials like SAML or
Digital Certificates to make access control decisions in their implementation.
While this can be done, these credentials were designed for authentication. A
similar approach to the one discussed in this chapter is [Kagal et al. 2004], in
which the authors use ontologies to add authorization annotations to OWL-S.
OWL-S is used to add semantics to Web services. This is done through a
mapping of concepts in OWL-S to WSDL types. Their approach adds
extensibility elements to the OWL-S constructs for the purpose of supplying
authorization information.
An idea that has gained momentum recently is that of a hybrid
approach. This approach incorporates real world concepts in ontology with
rule based ontology and is described in [Kagal et al. 2004]. The strength of
their approach is in describing access control policies with multiple
ontologies. This provides for greater expressiveness since the semantics of
rules may be incorporated.
When developing a system to perform a function that is currently in
research, it is important not to reinvent the wheel. For example, extending
the accepted standard WSP by adding semantic annotations. Instead of
creating an entirely new standard it is better to build on an accepted
standard. In addition, using the RBAC standard for an annotation scheme
and for our ontologies. Other approaches have developed their own
authorization ontologies, however RBAC is an accepted standard.
30 Chapter 7
Policy matching in Semantic Web services is a complicated area of
research. [Verma et al., 2005] details an implementation of Semantic Policy
matching using the Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL). [Wu et al.,
2002] describes how to incorporate access control in a business process
(workflow). It illustrates fundamental capabilities in a workflow and why
authorization and access control need to be expressed semantically. This is
particularly relevant to our research on the client side where we had to
decide on the appropriate location for client information. Anyanwu et al.,
2003] examines the issues of complex processes inherent in health care
applications in a heterogeneous cross domain environment.
6. QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION
Beginner:
1. Why are traditional Web services authorization techniques not
adequate for Semantic discovery? (Traditional authorization
techniques do not suggest what types of users may have access to
the resource provided through the Web service.
2. Why is the concept of Roles important in Semantic Authorization?
(They are the concepts built upon an existing standard which
describe users. This information along with domain knowledge
provides the basis for Semantic reasoning, or inferencing.)
Intermediate:
1. How could independent enterprises exchange their authorization
ontologies with those enterprises that have discovered their Web
services? (through accounts, place them freely on the internet for
download)
2. What security risks are involved with placing the ontologies on the
internet? (Exposing too much information regarding user
accounts).
3. Can you think of a solution that would alleviate the security risk
mentioned in the previous question? (This answer may differ
depending on your previous answer. However, for exposing too
much information, a generic ontology for an entire domain would
allow enterprises to share this information across any domain. The
ontology implementation details in regards to a specific enterprise
would not be shared.)
Advanced:
1. Discuss some of the relationships between RBAC concepts and a
real world enterprise. How could these relationships be exploited in
Securing Semantic Web services? (Discussion question, meant to
be thought provoking. No right or wrong answer.)
7. Bringing Semantic Security to Semantic Web Services 31
2. Can you think of any ways that semantics could benefit the security
technologies currently in use; i.e. authentication, encryption, etc.?
What kind of ontology would you design to do this? (Discussion
question, meant to be thought provoking. No right or wrong
answer.)
