User: Please list several common load balancing algorithms and compare their advantages and disadvantages.
Assistant: 1. Round Robin: Assign requests to different servers in turn, repeating the cycle. The advantages are simple implementation, fair distribution, and no need to consider server performance differences. The disadvantage is that the actual load of the server is not considered, resulting in low resource utilization of some servers and high resource utilization of other servers. 2. Random algorithm (Random): Randomly assign requests to different servers. The advantages are simple implementation and good randomness. The disadvantage is that it lacks the meaning of load balancing and does not consider the actual load of the server. 3. Weighted Round Robin: According to the difference in server performance, assign different weight values, and then assign requests to different servers. Servers with higher weights get more requests. The advantage is that requests can be allocated according to server performance, and the effect is relatively good, which is suitable for situations where there is a large gap in server performance in the cluster. The disadvantage is that the implementation is more complicated, and the weight value needs to be manually set. 4. Least Connections algorithm (Least Connections): Assign the request to the server with the least number of connections, that is, the server with the least number of existing connections. The advantage is that requests can be allocated dynamically, which can avoid overloading a single server. The disadvantage is that it needs to monitor the number of server connections in real time, and the implementation is more complicated. 5. IP hash algorithm (IP Hash): Calculate the hash value according to the client's IP address, and then distribute the request to the server corresponding to the hash value. The advantage is that requests will be assigned to the same server under the same conditions, which is suitable for stateful services, such as Session. The disadvantage is that it depends on the client IP address, which is not suitable for the situation where the number of clients is small and the IP address is fixed.
