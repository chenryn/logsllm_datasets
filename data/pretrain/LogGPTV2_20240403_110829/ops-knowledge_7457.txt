User: As subject, is is possible with just one source code, we can deploy our code to Openshift or Google App Engine? Heroku is not necessarily in my case. 
My application is using Python Flask + PostgreSQL 9.1. I love the easiness in Openshift when I configure my technology stack, but is the case will be same with GAE?
Thanks!
Assistant: I work on Openshift and at this time I'm not aware of anything that will deploy your code to GAE and Openshift at the same time.
You might be able to write your own script for it.
