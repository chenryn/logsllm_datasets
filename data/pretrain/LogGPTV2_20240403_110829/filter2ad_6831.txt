Abstract
This panel highlights a selection of the most inter-
esting and provocative papers from the 2005 New Se-
curity Paradigms Workshop. This workshop was held
September 2005 - the URL for more information is
. The panel consists of au-
thors of the selected papers, and the session is mod-
erated by the workshop’s general chairs. We present
selected papers focusing on exciting major themes that
emerged from the workshop. These are the papers that
will provoke the most interesting discussion at ACSAC.
1. Panel Theme
This panel presents a selection of the best, most in-
teresting, and most provocative work from the New Se-
curity Paradigms Workshop 2005. For fourteen years,
the New Security Paradigms Workshop (NSPW) has
provided a productive and highly interactive forum for
innovative new approaches to computer security.
NSPW is an invitational workshop of deliberately
small size, in order to facilitate deep, meaningful dis-
cussions of new ideas. Authors are encouraged to
present work that might seem risky in other settings.
All participants are charged with providing construc-
tive feedback. The resulting brainstorming environ-
ment has proven to be an excellent medium for the
furthering of ‘far out’ and visionary ideas.
Our philosophy is to look for signi(cid:12)cantly new
paradigms and shifts from previous thinking, and facil-
itate the debate within a constructive environment of
experienced researchers and practitioners along with
newer participants in the (cid:12)eld.
In keeping with the
NSPW philosophy, this panel challenges many of the
dominant paradigms in information security. You can
de(cid:12)nitely expect it to be highly interactive;
in the
NSPW tradition, look forward to lively exchanges be-
tween the panelists and the audience. So come pre-
pared with an open mind and ready to question and
comment on what our panelists present!
2. Panel Format and Papers
The panel will consist of four authors of papers
selected by the NSPW 2005 General and Program
Chairs, and it will be chaired by the general chair. Fol-
lowing are abstracts of each paper selected for presen-
tation
2.1. Speculative Virtual Veri(cid:2)cation:
Constrained Speculative Execution
Policy›
The ability for computing systems to autonomously
detect and correct faults and vulnerabilities would
greatly improve their stability and security. The job
of processors has long been to simply execute code,
and getting them to do exactly that at high levels of
performance has been the focus of research and indus-
try development. As a result, security is not integrated
into the fabric of execution.
This paper advocates modifying general-purpose
processors to (a) provide implicit supervision function-
ality, (b) export a policy-driven monitoring mechanism,
and (c) provide the foundation for an automatic re-
sponse capability via instruction stream rewriting.
We propose speculative virtual veri(cid:12)cation (SVV),
a set of architectural components that provides a ba-
sis for such systems by speculatively executing the en-
tire instruction stream.
In much the same way that
a superscalar processor speculatively executes past a
branch instruction and discards the mis-predicted code
path, we propose that processors operate on the in-
nals can be recorded and processed in an accurate and
repeatable way, a pass-thought system might provide
a quasi two-factor, changeable authentication method
that is resistant to shoulder-sur(cid:12)ng. The size of the
space of a pass-thought system would seem to be po-
tentially enormous, although in practice it will be (cid:12)nite
due to system constraints and processing methods. In
this talk, we discuss the motivation and potential of
pass-thought authentication, and outline the design of
what we believe to be a currently feasible pass-thought
system.
2.4. Internet Instability and Disturbance: Goal or
Menace?
Self-replicating code has become an unfortunate
part of today’s online environment. Viruses and worms
have the ability to become pandemic within minutes of
(cid:12)rst release, and our protection systems are primarily
reactive in nature. Thus, there is little or no protection
from a new worm which uses a remote exploit in order
to spread. Furthermore, such rapidly-moving threats
have a documented ability to cause systemic outages;
ultimately, such attacks may threaten the overall sta-
bility of the Internet itself. Currently, most exploits
leveraged by worms have been well-known and easily
solvable if the system maintainer had followed best se-
curity practices (e.g. deployed a (cid:12)rewall and/or carried
out timely patching of vulnerabilities). Thus, actions
which drive practitioners toward tighter security are
likely to have a positive long-term impact on the over-
all stability of the global network.
In this session, we take the unusual position that
low-level virus and worm outbreaks are highly bene(cid:12)-
cial to the overall goal of preventing catastrophic Inter-
net failure. To illustrate this position we draw from a
biological analogy: the Intermediate Disturbance Hy-
pothesis. This hypothesis argues that within many nat-
ural systems it is a continual cycle of disruption which
drives diversity... and hence stability and resilience. Fi-
nally, we conclude that the deliberate release of viruses
and worms that are not threatening holistically may
be a necessary approach to protect the Internet from
catastrophic outbreaks. This position is supported by
empirical evidence from the computer world and by
further comparison with biological systems.
struction stream in two phases. The (cid:12)rst phase ex-
ecutes instructions, optimistically \speculating" that
the results of these computations are benign. The sec-
ond phase makes the e(cid:11)ects of the speculated instruc-
tion stream visible to the OS and application software
layers and potentially rewrites the instruction stream
if it has been deemed harmful.
2.2. Visual Security Protocol Modeling
This paper argues that the existing model-driven
architecture paradigm does not adequately cover the
visual modeling of security protocols: sequences of in-
teractions between principals. A visual security proto-
col modeling notation should be event-based, composi-
tional, comprehensive, laconic, lucid, and well-de(cid:12)ned.
We can say informally that: event-based visual mod-
eling focuses on interaction patterns and avoids de-
tails of internal computations; compositional modeling
languages allow protocol models to be built from sub-
models that clearly correspond to the principals; com-
prehensive modeling languages can de(cid:12)ne all traces of
a security protocol with a single model; a non-laconic
model has more than one visual token representing the
same modeled object; a non-lucid model has more than
one modeled object represented by the same visual to-
ken; a well-de(cid:12)ned language has a formal syntax and
semantics.
Candidate visual modeling notations
from the
OMG’s Model Driven Architecture (MDA) fail to sat-
isfy one or more of these criteria, for modeling security
protocols. Existing visual modeling formalisms outside
the MDA also fail to satisfy one or more of these crite-
ria. To give some examples, Petri nets, statecharts, and
labeled transition systems are not event-based, compo-
sitional, or laconic; Harel’s Live Sequence Charts are
event-based, laconic, and compositional, but are not
comprehensive.
The GSPML visual language for security protocols
satis(cid:12)es all of the criteria. The paper presents GSPML
by example, using two security protocol models.
2.3. Authenticating With Our Minds
We present a novel idea for user authentication that
we call pass-thoughts.
Recent advances in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)
technology indicate that there is potential for a new
type of human-computer interaction: a user transmit-
ting thoughts directly to a computer. The goal of
a pass-thought system would be to extract as much
entropy as possible from a user’s brain signals upon
transmitting a thought. Provided that these brain sig-
