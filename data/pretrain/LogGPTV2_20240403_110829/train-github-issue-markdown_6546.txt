When using contextual variations of a "panel," it is advisable to maintain the same color for both the "panel-footer" and the "panel-header." This ensures visual consistency and enhances the overall design.

Here is an example to illustrate this point:

In this example, the header and footer of the panel share the same color, creating a cohesive and visually appealing look.
