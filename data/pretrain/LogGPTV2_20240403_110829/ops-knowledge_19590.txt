User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Access denied if I try to control Windows 2016 service remotely I have following script:

cmdkey.exe /add:COMPUTER /user:COMPUTER\user /pass:somepassword
sc \\COMPUTER stop Servicename


Works fine with Windows 2012 R2 but not with Windows 2016. With windows 2016 I get this error: [SC] OpenService FAILED 5: Access is denied.

User is admin. If I log to COMPUTER with User and run this command - it works.
If I run this command remotely from some domain account - it works.

Same problem with alternative command:

psservice \\COMPUTER -accepteula stop Servicename

Assistant: assuming the admin account is a local account you are probably encountering remote UAC.
