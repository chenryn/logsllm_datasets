User:  How to set up MySQL master-slave replication so that data can be automatically synchronized?
Assistant: MySQL master-slave replication refers to the process of automatically synchronizing data on one MySQL server to another or multiple MySQL servers. The implementation method is as follows: 1. Prepare two or more MYSQL servers, respectively the master server and the slave server; 2. Set the binary log (binlog) and the unique identifier (server id) on the master server; 4. Set up a replication account on the slave server, the permissions of this account need to include the permission to read binary logs from the master server; 5. The slave server connects to the master server and starts synchronizing data, you can use 6. Verify whether the master-slave server data is synchronized, including data and table structure. The advantage of setting up MySQL master-slave replication is that it can separate read and write operations, improve the performance and availability of the database, and also realize the functions of data backup and disaster recovery.
