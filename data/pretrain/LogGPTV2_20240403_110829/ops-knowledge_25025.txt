User: Where we work we need to remember about 10 long passwords which need to change every so often. I would like to create a utility which can potentially save these passwords in an encrypted file so that we can keep track of them.
I can think of some sort of dictionary passwd = {'host1':'pass1', 'host2':'pass2'}, etc, but I don't know what to do about encryption (absolutely zero experience in the topic).
So, my question is really two questions:

Is there a Linux-based utility which lets you do that?
If you were to program it in Python, how would you go about it?

A perk of approach two, would be for the software to update the ssh public keys after the password has been changed (you know the pain of updating ~15 tokens once you change your password).
As it can be expected, I have zero control over the actual network configuration and the management of scp keys. I can only hope to provide a simple utility to me an my very few coworkers so that, if we need to, we can retrieve a password on demand.
Cheers.
Assistant: On first i think you can change passwords on md5 of this passwords..
it will give more safety.
