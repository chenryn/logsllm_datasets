I'm trying to test controllers using functional tests. But I can not create a
test client, which would be authorized as specified user. This can be done
through the form, but it is not convenient. I found a way that allows to do
this, but in version 2.1 it does not work.
Test code
Is there a way to manually authorize the user or the only way to use a form or
stateless basic authorization like descibed in symfony book?
