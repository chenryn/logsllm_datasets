User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题windows 2008 DNS Website without www? I have a site on my server that only works with a www.
example: 
http://www.dartmouthplayers.ns.ca/
works but without it, it does not.
http://dartmouthplayers.ns.ca/

But the site's bindings has both listed:



and the DNS has the blank host record:


What did I not set right?

It's odd because:
http://dartmouthplayers.ns.ca/ - returns a 500 error
and http://randomtexthere.dartmouthplayers.ns.ca/ - returns a server not found error

thanks!

update: My event log has this error each time I try to access that domain:

Log Name:      Application

Keywords:      Classic

Assistant: This is good info.  We know DNS is working if you're getting 500s.  A 500 means your client is resolving the correct IP and that the server is throwing a 500 in response to the inbound HTTP request.

@coneslayer:  The screen shot appears to be that of IIS bindings and the title of the post "Windows..."

So I don't believe you have an IIS configuration issue.  It appears, from what we see so far, an application problem.

What is your default HTML file settings and is there some ASP/.NET or JavaScript within that is causing the 500 to be thrown?

Maybe throw up your web.config
