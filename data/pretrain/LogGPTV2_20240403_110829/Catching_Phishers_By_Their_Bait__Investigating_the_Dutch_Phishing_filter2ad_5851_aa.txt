## Abstract
Phishing kits, which are off-the-shelf and easy to deploy, are believed to lower the barrier for criminal entrepreneurs engaging in phishing. These kits facilitate the harvesting of user credentials by tricking victims into disclosing their information on fraudulent websites. However, the impact of these kits on the phishing landscape and their frequency of use remain unclear. This study leverages the use of TLS certificates by phishers to uncover potential Dutch phishing domains targeting the financial sector between September 2020 and January 2021. We collected 70 different Dutch phishing kits from the underground economy, identified 10 distinct kit families, and created unique fingerprints to measure their prevalence. Using this method, we identified 1,363 Dutch phishing domains that deployed these kits, capturing their end-to-end lifecycle from domain registration to takedown. Our findings indicate that the median uptime of phishing domains is just 24 hours, suggesting that phishers act quickly. Analysis of the deployed kits revealed that only a small number of different kits are in use, and phishers often employ decoy pages to enhance their luring capabilities. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) prevalent in the Dutch phishing landscape and offers public policy recommendations for anti-phishing initiatives.

## 1. Introduction
Phishing is a widespread form of social engineering that harvests user credentials by tricking targets into disclosing personal or financial information on fraudulent websites. The deployment of phishing websites has become trivial with the availability of "phishing kits," which can be bought, leased, or even downloaded for free in the underground economy, such as dark net markets, social media platforms, or secure messaging services like Telegram. These kits contain fully functional phishing websites that mimic popular banks or financial service providers, and the harvested credentials are exfiltrated via email or collected within an administrator panel.

Given the tailored nature of phishing attacks to specific audiences and countries, understanding the impact of phishing kits requires investigation within specific linguistic or geographical areas. This aligns with previous research indicating that deployed phishing kits often target a particular audience and focus on banks in a single country.

In this study, we focus on phishing targeted at the Dutch financial sector, leveraging our position in the Dutch cybercrime ecosystem to capture the supply of phishing kits. The Dutch retail banking sector is highly concentrated, with just three large retail banks and a few smaller ones serving the entire market, primarily through online banking. Responding swiftly and adequately to phishing is challenging, as many phishing domains are taken down by the time they are reported to law enforcement agencies (LEAs). To overcome this, it is essential to proactively detect phishing domains and provide a real-time overview of the phishing landscape. This paper presents a novel, multi-stage method to detect phishing domains at scale, capture their attributes, and identify the presence of phishing kits.

## 2. Anatomy of a Phishing Campaign
A successful phishing campaign involves several crucial steps. In this section, we examine common techniques used to lure victims and make them disclose their credentials, followed by a depiction of the complete end-to-end lifecycle of a typical phishing campaign.

### 2.1 Luring in Victims
The success of a phishing attack depends heavily on the credibility of the phishing message. Phishers use various techniques and narratives to craft sophisticated messages that trick victims into disclosing their credentials. These techniques can be analyzed using Robert Cialdini's principles of persuasion, which include scarcity and consistency. Recent work by Van der Heijden & Allodi [49] showed that these two principles are the most popular among phishers.

While the contents of emails or text messages are unknown when analyzing phishing websites, we identified these principles in the various phishing kits we examined. For example, requests for additional shipping costs, identification for DigiD, or returning debit cards to the bank. We also observed more subtle, multi-staged approaches, where victims are directed to a decoy page before being led to a fake bank login page. These techniques, employed by multipanel phishing kits, will be examined in more detail in Section 4.

### 2.2 End-to-End Lifecycle of a Phishing Campaign
The steps to set up a phishing campaign are nearly identical, regardless of the luring techniques used. A typical phishing campaign consists of five steps:

1. **Acquire a Phishing Kit**: Phishers obtain a phishing kit containing a website designed to trick victims into disclosing their credentials. While they could create this website themselves, it is easier to use an off-the-shelf kit.
2. **Obtain a Domain**: The phisher needs a domain to host the phishing website. This can be done by hijacking an insecure website or registering a new domain name.
3. **Acquire Hosting Service**: The phisher rents a Virtual Private Server (VPS) to store the phishing kit files.
4. **Obtain a TLS Certificate**: To make the phishing website appear legitimate, the attacker acquires an X.509 (TLS) certificate to create a secure HTTPS connection.
5. **Deliver the Bait**: The phisher sends the bait to potential victims via email, text message, or other means and waits for them to fill in their credentials.

These steps are often explained in detail by the suppliers of phishing kits, making it easy for their "customers" to set up a phishing website. We identified the acquisition of the TLS certificate as a valuable data source for detecting potential phishing domains.

## 3. Measurement Methodology
To study the Dutch phishing landscape, we follow the lifecycle of a phishing campaign. Our measurement approach consists of three steps:

1. **Collect Phishing Kits on Telegram**: We employed snowball sampling to collect phishing kits on Telegram, reaching saturation after identifying 50 public fraud-related channels.
2. **Identify Possible Phishing Domains**: We identified possible phishing domains based on issued TLS certificates.
3. **Crawl Web Pages**: We crawled the corresponding web pages to identify the used phishing kit and capture the end-to-end lifecycle of the attack.

Our methodology for each step is detailed in the following subsections. We store the data produced by all our measurement steps in an Elasticsearch instance, with Kibana for easy data visualization and monitoring. The complete measurement system is deployed in Docker containers on a cloud server.

## 4. Results and Discussion
### 4.1 Analysis of Collected Phishing Kits
We collected 70 different Dutch phishing kits and identified 10 distinct families. By creating unique fingerprints of these kits, we measured their prevalence in the wild. Our analysis revealed that only a small number of different kits are in use, and phishers often employ decoy pages to enhance their luring capabilities.

### 4.2 Examination of Phishing Domains
We identified 1,363 Dutch phishing domains deploying these kits between September 2020 and January 2021. The median uptime of these domains was just 24 hours, indicating that phishers act quickly. We compiled a comprehensive overview of the Dutch phishing landscape, including commonly used (decoy) tactics, phishing kit characteristics, and preferred hosting providers.

### 4.3 Validation and Benchmarking
We benchmarked and validated our methodology with external data, depicting the end-to-end lifecycle of phishing campaigns with an example. An overview of related work on phishing measurements and phishing kit analysis is provided, and we critically discuss our results and methods, sharing public policy takeaways and concluding our work.

## 5. Conclusion
This paper provides a comprehensive picture of the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) prevalent in the Dutch phishing landscape. By leveraging the use of TLS certificates and CertiÔ¨Åcate Transparency Logs, we were able to detect and analyze a significant number of phishing domains. Our findings highlight the importance of proactive detection and real-time monitoring to combat phishing effectively. We offer public policy recommendations for anti-phishing initiatives, emphasizing the need for robust countermeasures and swift responses to mitigate the impact of phishing attacks.
