Abstract
Off-the-shelf, easy-to-deploy phishing kits are believed to
lower the threshold for criminal entrepreneurs going phishing.
That is, the practice of harvesting user credentials by tricking
victims into disclosing these on fraudulent websites. But, how
do these kits impact the phishing landscape? And, how often
are they used? We leverage the use of TLS certiﬁcates by
phishers to uncover possible Dutch phishing domains aimed
at the ﬁnancial sector between September 2020 and January
2021. We collect 70 different Dutch phishing kits in the un-
derground economy, and identify 10 distinct kit families. We
create unique ﬁngerprints of these kits to measure their preva-
lence in the wild. With this novel method, we identify 1,363
Dutch phishing domains that deploy these phishing kits, and
capture their end-to-end life cycle – from domain registration,
kit deployment, to take-down. We ﬁnd the median uptime of
phishing domains to be just 24 hours, indicating that phishers
do act fast. Our analysis of the deployed phishing kits reveals
that only a small number of different kits are in use. We dis-
cover that phishers increase their luring capabilities by using
decoy pages to trick victims into disclosing their credentials.
In this paper, we paint a comprehensive picture of the tac-
tics, techniques and procedures (TTP) prevalent in the Dutch
phishing landscape and present public policy takeaways for
anti-phishing initiatives.
1 Introduction
Phishing is a pervasive type of social engineering that harvests
user credentials by tricking targets into disclosing personal or
ﬁnancial information – e.g., credit card details – on a fraudu-
lent website. Deploying a phishing website has become trivial
with so-called ‘phishing kits’, which can be bought, leased
or even downloaded for free in the underground economy –
like dark net markets [34], social media platforms or secure
messaging services like Telegram [29]. A phishing kit con-
tains full-ﬂedged phishing websites [9], mimicking popular
banks or ﬁnancial service providers. Phished credentials are
exﬁltrated either through e-mail [47] or collected within an
administrator panel. As phishing attacks are often tailored to a
speciﬁc audience and country [44], understanding the impact
of phishing kits on the entire landscape, should be investigated
per linguistic or geographical area to create coherent insights
on phishing tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP). This
speciﬁc focus aligns with earlier work ﬁnding that deployed
phishing kits often victimize a particular audience and target
banks in a single country [17].
Given our information position in the Dutch cybercrime
ecosystem, enabling us to capture the supply of phishing kits,
we take phishing targeted at the Dutch ﬁnancial sector as the
focus of our research. The Dutch retail banking sector is very
concentrated, as just three large retail banks and a few smaller
ones make up the entire market [2]. More importantly, they all
primarily service customers through online banking, which is
therefore widespread and popular in The Netherlands [51].
Where executing a phishing attack has become quite sim-
ple, responding swiftly and adequately to this phenomenon is
far from trivial. By the time phishing domains are reported
to law enforcement agencies (LEA), many of them are al-
ready ofﬂine. They can be either taken down by the phishers
themselves or by hosting providers, often initiated by notice-
and-takedown requests by banks who’s clients get phished.
All of this makes phishing campaign attribution rather difﬁ-
cult, as the window wherein evidence can be collected closes
fast. To overcome this challenge, it is essential to pro-actively
detect phishing domains and get a minute-to-minute overview
of the phishing landscape. Measuring the scale and operations
is crucial for deﬁning robust countermeasures and deploying
them before these attacks can cause any harm. Additionally,
the recent adoption of SMS and WhatsApp as a means of
phishing message delivery [37] has sped up the execution
of these attacks even more. Therefore, decreasing the time
between the start of the attack and detection – before the ar-
rival of the ﬁrst victim – is crucial. In this paper, we present a
novel, multi-stage method to detect phishing domains at scale
in real time, capture their attributes and identify the presence
of phishing kits.

We leverage the fact that many phishing domains are secured
by TLS connections [16] and that newly issued X.509 certiﬁ-
cates can be monitored in real time by observing Certiﬁcate
Transparency Logs [19]. By continuously monitoring these
logs for ‘phishy’ domains and subsequently crawling them,
we create a dataset of potential malignant domains. By ﬁn-
gerprinting parts of the source code and structure of gathered
phishing kits, we measure their prevalence in the wild by de-
tecting these ﬁngerprints on live phishing domains. We group
related kits into families, analyze their deployments and gain
more insights into the TTP used by these phishers.
Our analyses aims to create an overview of the impact
of off-the-shelf kits on the Dutch phishing landscape and to
identify commonly used TTP. In this paper, we make the
following contributions:
• We present the ﬁrst empirical, longitudinal measurement
study of the end-to-end life cycle of Dutch phishing
campaigns.
• We collect 70 different Dutch phishing kits, identify 10
different families and create unique ﬁngerprints in order
to examine the prevalence of these kits in the wild.
• We leverage the use of TLS certiﬁcates by phishers and
Certiﬁcate Transparency Logs to ﬁnd 1,363 conﬁrmed
Dutch phishing domains deploying these kits between
September 2020 and January 2021.
• We compile a comprehensive overview of the Dutch
phishing landscape including commonly used (decoy)
tactics, phishing kit characteristics and preferred hosting
providers.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: We ana-
lyze the anatomy of a phishing campaign in Section 2, explain
our methodology in Section 3 and present our results in the
subsequent sections. In Section 4, we discuss the results of
our analysis on gathered phishing kits. In Section 5, we ex-
amine the domains used by phishers and show how phishing
kits are deployed in Section 6. We benchmark and validate
our methodology with external data in Section 7 and depict
the end-to-end life cycle of phishing campaigns with an ex-
ample in Section 8. An overview of related work on phishing
measurements and phishing kit analysis is given in Section 9.
Finally, we critically discuss our results and methods in Sec-
tion 10, share our public policy takeaways and conclude our
work in Section 11.
2 Anatomy of a phishing campaign
A successful phishing expedition is the result of many crucial
steps a phisher needs to take successively. In this section,
we examine common techniques to lure in victims and make
them disclose their credentials. Next, we depict the complete
end-to-end life cycle of a typical phishing campaign. We end
this section with the scope of our work before we elaborate
on our measurement methodology.
2.1 Luring in victims
The chances of successfully executing a phishing attack are
highly dependent on the credibility of the phishing message –
the bait. Therefore, phishers use a wide range of techniques
and narratives to craft sophisticated phishing messages to
trick victims into disclosing their credentials without thinking
twice. We can analyze such techniques by utilizing the work
of Robert Caldini, the author of The Psychology of Persuasion,
who identiﬁed several principles that explain how ‘mental
shortcuts’ can be exploited for the persuasion of others [8].
Recent work by Van der Heijden & Allodi [49] employed
Caldini’s principles on phishing e-mails and have shown that
scarcity – time is limited, so the victim should act quickly –
and consistency – victim is already a customer of this bank, so
communication is expected – are the most popular persuasion
techniques among phishers.
Although the contents of e-mails or text messages are un-
known when analyzing phishing websites, we were able to
identify these two principles on pages included in the various
phishing kits we examine in Section 4, as persuasion tech-
niques are exempliﬁed there. Like a request to pay additional
shipping costs for postal packages (scarcity), an identiﬁcation
request for DigiD – the Dutch online identity to interact with
governmental organizations (consistency) – or a request to
return debit cards to the bank for safe destruction and renewal
(both scarcity and consistency). We noticed that besides the
traditional approach of demanding victims to login to their
online banking account directly, attackers also deployed more
subtle, multi-staged, approaches. The ﬁrst two examples are
part of such an approach phishers follow to improve the cred-
ibility of their attack. In such a staged approach, victims are
directed towards a decoy page like one of the aforementioned
examples ﬁrst, as shown schematically in Figure 1. There are
no user credentials harvested on this page, but the victim is
directed to a page on which a variety of banks can be chosen
to initiate further steps eventually. As the victim is already
on a ‘trusted’ website, it is likely to be less observant. Any
irregularities are unlikely to be spotted, making disclosing
credentials to one of the fake bank login pages deployed by
phishers the ﬁnal step of the fall trap. Phishing kits employing
these techniques and containing templates for multiple banks
are called multipanels, which we will examine in more detail
in Section 4.
2.2 End-to-end life cycle of a phishing cam-
paign
Whether or not advanced luring techniques are used, the steps
to setup a phishing campaign are near-identical. A typical

Figure 1: Luring technique with a decoy landing page and
various fake banking login pages – a so-called multipanel
phishing attack consists out of ﬁve steps, which we illustrate
in Figure 2. First, a phisher has to obtain a phishing kit that
contains a website created to trick victims into disclosing their
credentials. Although phishers could make this website them-
selves, it is much easier to deploy an off-the-shelf phishing
kit that contains all the necessary resources. These phishing
kits can be obtained through various sources, such as dark
net markets [50] and online forums, but they have become
available on public chat applications like Telegram [29] as
well. Second, the phisher needs a domain where the phishing
website is located. This can either be done by hijacking an
insecure and unrelated website – no costs, more effort – or
by simply registering a new domain name – small costs, less
effort. Third, when a new domain is registered and a phish-
ing kit obtained, the phisher needs a Web hosting provider to
store the phishing kit ﬁles. Consequently, phishers often rent
a Virtual Private Server (VPS), which allows them to install a
Web server capable of hosting their website. Fourth, to make
the phishing website look even more legitimate, the attacker
acquires an X.509 (TLS) certiﬁcate to create a secure con-
nection between victim and website over HTTPS. According
to the Anti-Phishing Working Group, 78% of all phishing
in 2020 is served over HTTPS [16]. This practice plays into
the expectation of Internet users to observe a (green) padlock
icon in the browser’s address bar when visiting their bank’s
website – to indicate a secure connection. As Google Chrome
started marking Web pages served over HTTP as ‘not secure’
in September 2018 [42], potential victims could hesitate ﬁll-
ing in their credentials when the website is not served over a
secured connection. Obtaining these TLS certiﬁcates is easy
and often free through certiﬁcate authorities like Let’s En-
crypt [10]. With the website in place, the phisher delivers the
bait to potential victims by e-mail, text message or through
other means and waits for victims to ﬁll in their credentials.
As we will show in Section 4, these steps are often ex-
plained in great detail by the supplier of phishing kits, al-
lowing their ‘customers’ to easily setup a phishing website

themselves. We, on the other hand, examined these steps in
the life cycle of a phishing campaign and identiﬁed the fourth
step, obtaining the TLS certiﬁcate, as a valuable data source
for detecting potential phishing domains. More importantly,
this is also the only real-time and public data source avail-
able to us. For the remainder of this paper, we follow the
steps in this life cycle to present and structure our ﬁndings.
As the work on examinations and observations of phishing
websites in the wild is limited [35, 39] and insights into the
complete life cycle of a phishing campaign combined with
thorough phishing kit analysis are absent, we designed and im-
plemented a measurement system to monitor and analyze the
Dutch phishing landscape. The focus on this one consumer
market is logical as Han et al. [17] stated that phishing victims
are often originating from the same country, which underlines
the necessity for country speciﬁc phishing research. Likewise,
earlier work on this topic highlighted the fast disappearance
of phishing domains [39], making attribution rather difﬁcult.
Therefore, it is essential to create a system that could assist
law enforcement to quickly respond to these attacks.
3 Measurement methodology
To study the Dutch phishing landscape, we follow the life
cycle of a phishing campaign as explained in the previous sec-
tion. Our measurement approach consists out of the following
three steps: 1) collect phishing kits on Telegram employing
snowball sampling, 2) identify possible phishing domains
based on issued TLS certiﬁcates, and 3) crawl the correspond-
ing Web pages to identify the used phishing kit and the capture
the end-to-end life cycle of the attack. The methodology used
to analyze each of these steps is explained in the following
subsections. We store the data produced by all our measure-
ment steps in an Elasticsearch instance, together with Kibana
for easy data visualization and monitoring. The complete mea-
surement system is deployed in Docker containers on a cloud
server and presented in Figure 3.

shared links in the chat. This snowball approach is a com-
mon sampling technique, that allows to reach saturation in
data collection when the total population is hidden or hard to
reach [1]. Our data collection saturated after we did not ﬁnd
any new links to our sample of public fraud-related Telegram
channels (n = 50). Phishing kits shared in these channels are
often free – e.g., as a trial version with limited possibilities –
can be leased for a customized period of time – as is the case
