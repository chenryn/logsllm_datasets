In the "Install" tab under "Settings", the search box is no longer searching
when the enter key is pressed. In order to search I have to click on the
inactive button in the button group with "Packages/Themes", then click back to
the category that I actually want to search. I'm on a new MacBook running OS X
10.10 with Atom v0.206.0.
