To analyze the flagged links that presented recurring diurnal
patterns, we ensured that we detected no level shift on the near
side, which would mean that the observed congestion was not at
the targeted link. In this step we also tagged for further analysis
links showing unclear patterns, i.e., RTTs to the far end presented
a diurnal waveform, while those to the near end were inconclusive.
To make robust inferences about whether any observed congestion
was at the targeted links, we used the Record-routes method [24, 28]
to check path symmetry, thereby ensuring that an increase in RTTs
from a near to a far router was solely due to traffic on that link.
We then investigated the level shift sensitivity to decide whether
to directly use its output to calculate the width of the congested
period, or to sanitize it before doing so. We computed the average
magnitude Aw and the average duration ∆tU D between consecutive
upshift and downshift. For links showing recurring diurnal patterns,
we investigated whether congestion had a measurable effect on
packet loss. Finally, we interviewed the IXP operators to validate
and corroborate the obtained results as well as the suggested causes.
6 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We summarize our measurements per IXP and quantify how many
observed links experienced congestion during the study (Table 2).
We then shed light on the evolution of the number of discovered
links, AS neighbors, and peers of each VP’s AS. Then we analyze in
depth the most interesting results per VP, characterizing whether
the congestion was sustained or transient, the impact on packet
loss rate, and the causes of the observed phenomenon.
6.1 Evolution of number of discovered links
We summarize per VP in Table 2, the total number of discovered
IP links, inferred IP peering links, as well as AS neighbors, and
peers obtained from the border mapping process (§4), when consid-
ering three snapshots. Discovered IP links gather all router-level
links found to connect the VP’s AS to that of any of its neighbors.
Inferred IP peering links are the subset of discovered IP links hav-
ing any side that belongs to the IXP prefix (§5). The number of
neighbors and peers of the AS host are the highest (1,215 and 197
respectively) for our VP in AS30844 (Liquid Telecom) that peers at
KIXP. We noticed that the number of neighbors and peers decreased
from 13 on 17/03/2016 to 7 on 15/11/2016 for AS30997 (GIXA): this

drop is due to the commercialization of the content network of the
IXP (§6.2.1), causing the disconnection of non-registered members.
Meanwhile, AS33791 (TIX) and AS37228 (RINEX) have a roughly
constant number of peers over our measurement period.
Table 2 also presents the number of detected congested links.
Congested links are those for which RTTs to the far end show a
recurring diurnal pattern, whereas those to the near end stay con-
stant. A congestion case that is later mitigated is described as being
transient in the rest of this paper; otherwise we refer to it as sus-
tained. While for the first four probes, we found one or more cases
of congested links, we did not detect any cases for the last two (VP5
and VP6). In fact, the fraction of observed links that experienced
any congestion is at most 7.7 % for VP1, 3.3 % for VP2, 0.6 % for
VP3, and 33 % for VP4. In total, 2.2 % of the discovered IP peering
links experienced congestion. We thus did not find any evidence
of widespread congestion. That said, we analyze in depth, in the
next section, striking congestion cases observed from VP1 and VP4,
while highlighting their causes and consequences.
6.2 Analysis of congestion cases
6.2.1 Cases seen from VP1 deployed at GIXA. Only two of the
links mapped by VP1 hosted at GIXA [17] experienced congestion
during our measurement period: the links to GHANATEL (Voda-
fone, AS29614) and KNET (AS33786).
GIXA — GHANATEL
The waveform registered for the first link presents different ampli-
tudes over a total of roughly 5 months. First, RTTs to the far end
sometimes peak at 20 ms and 50 ms at other times, while those to
the near end remain low and constant during the first 3.5 months
(03/03/2016 to 14/06/2016) termed phase 1. Figure 1 shows part of
phase 1. Our analysis of the record-routes (RR) probes during that
period gives us confidence that the route is symmetric. Since the
RR probes showed symmetry, then the peak on top of the peak
depicted by the shape of the red curve of Figure 1 is interesting: it
likely indicates congestion in both directions on the link.
From the level shifts that occurred periodically between
15/03/2016 to 14/06/2016, we inferred the average magnitude Aw
Figure 1: RTTs GIXA–GHANATEL in part of phase 1
of the shifts to be 27.9 ms and ∆tU D, roughly 20 hours, implying
long congestion events. While discussing with the IXP operator
about the possible causes of such phenomenon, the operator first
informed us that the GIXA peering and content networks are sepa-
rated. The content network (hosting VP1) contains Google caches
(GGCs) that need to be updated through transit links. In phase 1,
