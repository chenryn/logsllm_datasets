### Analysis of Flagged Links with Recurring Diurnal Patterns

To analyze the flagged links that presented recurring diurnal patterns, we ensured that there was no level shift on the near side, indicating that the observed congestion was not at the targeted link. We also tagged links showing unclear patterns, where RTTs to the far end presented a diurnal waveform, but those to the near end were inconclusive.

To make robust inferences about whether any observed congestion was at the targeted links, we used the Record-routes method [24, 28] to check path symmetry. This ensured that an increase in RTTs from a near to a far router was solely due to traffic on that link. We then investigated the level shift sensitivity to decide whether to directly use its output to calculate the width of the congested period or to sanitize it before doing so. We computed the average magnitude \( A_w \) and the average duration \( \Delta t_{UD} \) between consecutive upshift and downshift. For links showing recurring diurnal patterns, we investigated whether congestion had a measurable effect on packet loss. Finally, we interviewed IXP operators to validate and corroborate the obtained results and suggested causes.

### Results and Discussion

#### Summary of Measurements per IXP

We summarize our measurements per IXP and quantify how many observed links experienced congestion during the study (Table 2). We then shed light on the evolution of the number of discovered links, AS neighbors, and peers of each VP’s AS. We analyze in depth the most interesting results per VP, characterizing whether the congestion was sustained or transient, the impact on packet loss rate, and the causes of the observed phenomenon.

#### Evolution of the Number of Discovered Links

We summarize per VP in Table 2 the total number of discovered IP links, inferred IP peering links, as well as AS neighbors and peers obtained from the border mapping process (§4), considering three snapshots. Discovered IP links include all router-level links found to connect the VP’s AS to that of any of its neighbors. Inferred IP peering links are the subset of discovered IP links having any side that belongs to the IXP prefix (§5).

For example, our VP in AS30844 (Liquid Telecom) that peers at KIXP has the highest number of neighbors and peers (1,215 and 197 respectively). We noticed a decrease in the number of neighbors and peers from 13 on 17/03/2016 to 7 on 15/11/2016 for AS30997 (GIXA). This drop is due to the commercialization of the content network of the IXP, causing the disconnection of non-registered members. Meanwhile, AS33791 (TIX) and AS37228 (RINEX) have a roughly constant number of peers over our measurement period.

Table 2 also presents the number of detected congested links. Congested links are those for which RTTs to the far end show a recurring diurnal pattern, whereas those to the near end stay constant. A congestion case that is later mitigated is described as being transient; otherwise, it is referred to as sustained. While for the first four probes, we found one or more cases of congested links, we did not detect any cases for the last two (VP5 and VP6). The fraction of observed links that experienced any congestion is at most 7.7% for VP1, 3.3% for VP2, 0.6% for VP3, and 33% for VP4. In total, 2.2% of the discovered IP peering links experienced congestion. We thus did not find any evidence of widespread congestion. 

In the next section, we analyze in depth striking congestion cases observed from VP1 and VP4, highlighting their causes and consequences.

### Analysis of Congestion Cases

#### Cases Seen from VP1 Deployed at GIXA

Only two of the links mapped by VP1 hosted at GIXA [17] experienced congestion during our measurement period: the links to GHANATEL (Vodafone, AS29614) and KNET (AS33786).

**GIXA — GHANATEL**

The waveform registered for the first link presents different amplitudes over a total of roughly 5 months. First, RTTs to the far end sometimes peak at 20 ms and 50 ms at other times, while those to the near end remain low and constant during the first 3.5 months (03/03/2016 to 14/06/2016), termed phase 1. Figure 1 shows part of phase 1. Our analysis of the record-routes (RR) probes during that period gives us confidence that the route is symmetric. Since the RR probes showed symmetry, the peak on top of the peak depicted by the shape of the red curve in Figure 1 likely indicates congestion in both directions on the link.

From the level shifts that occurred periodically between 15/03/2016 to 14/06/2016, we inferred the average magnitude \( A_w \) of the shifts to be 27.9 ms and \( \Delta t_{UD} \) to be roughly 20 hours, implying long congestion events. While discussing with the IXP operator about the possible causes of such phenomena, the operator informed us that the GIXA peering and content networks are separated. The content network (hosting VP1) contains Google caches (GGCs) that need to be updated through transit links. In phase 1, the updates caused significant congestion, leading to the observed peaks in RTTs.
