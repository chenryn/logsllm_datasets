Today’s presentation
• This presentation has two parts:
• Rights escalation using API call vulnerabilities
• Subverting Windows logon 
• Key take-aways
• Better understanding of simple desktop/console 
vulnerabilities
• Protecting information assets with layered defense
• Subverting desktop security for fun and entertainment!
What is your opinion?
• You will be asked to participate at the end 
of this presentation:
• What methods do you use to secure your 
environment?
• Do you follow defense in depth principles? 
• What would you do different?
Help API vulnerability
• What is a “help API” vulnerability?
A vulnerability that is exposed when an application running with system level 
rights makes a API call to the help viewer and does not drop any privileges 
before invoking the help viewer.
A user can then us the help viewer to access other application which will 
execute at system level.
• Bugtraq report
Bugtraq ID 8884 Oct 24th 2003  Brett Moore
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/8884
Help API vulnerability
• How wide spread is this vulnerability?
• Why do vendors continue down this path?
• Money
• Beat competitors to market – cutting corners
• Vendors presume that users will not abuse their product 
– security through obscurity
• Sell first, fix later – make the customer pay to fix flaws
Help API vulnerability
• Demonstration
• Netware Zenworks remote desktop manager
• Novell quickly released a security patch
• Spysweeper anti spyware enterprise version
• Help API fixed, but application still runs at system level 
and interacts with desktop
• Mcafee AV 4.51
• This was reported in Sep 15 2004 Bugtraq #11181
• A different exploit point
Help API vulnerability
• How do I tell if my system is vulnerable?
• What is running with system rights?
• Taskmgr ( take a close look)
• What icons are in the tray?
• What applications need higher rights to function 
correctly?
• Antivirus
• Anti Spyware
• Remote management tools
• Auditing tools and application
Help API vulnerability
• How do we protect ourselves from a Help 
API Vulnerability?
• Group policy (maybe)
• Remove icons from the system tray
• Test all new applications before deployment
This years project
Subverting 
Windows logon
Subverting Windows logon
• This year’s research project and what we 
learned
• Credit for all the hard work
• Three rules that drove the research:
• It must be simple
• It needs to fit in my pocket if not in my head
• Must be able to easily protect against it
Bypassing Windows logon
• What, Why, Were, When and How
• Can Windows logon be subverted?
• Curiosity “Just because its there”
• XP, W2K3 , etc
• Bob is back on the job
• How
• Methodology - “the attack process”
• Programmatically -“the attack application”
Exploit part 1 “Utility Manager”
• What is Utility Manager?
• How does it work and how do we access it?
• Why is it such a problem?
• Local System
• User controlled
Exploit part 2 “ Logon Screen”
• User interface objects are managed using 
Windows stations and desktops
• Winsta0
• Multiple desktops in Windows
• Default
• Screen Saver
• Winlogon
Exploit Part 3 “Delivery”
• Admin access
• API vulnerabilities
• Bit level modification of hard disk
• Maintenance boot disk
Exploit part 4 “The code”
• This code poses no security issues by itself
• Basically we are just setting the 
CreateProcess thread to run under the 
winlogon desktop
• The security breakdown is how it is used. 
We are taking advantage of an architecture 
design issue within Microsoft
• The code is extremely simple!
Exploit part 4 “ The code”
#include 
int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hInst, HINSTANCE hPrevInst, LPSTR lpCmdLine, 
int nShowCmd) {
STARTUPINFO si;
PROCESS_INFORMATION pi;
memset( &si, 0, sizeof(si) );
memset( &pi, 0, sizeof(pi) );
si.cb = sizeof(STARTUPINFO);
si.lpDesktop = "Winsta0\\Winlogon";
CreateProcess("C:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe", NULL, NULL, NULL, false, NULL, 
NULL, NULL, &si, &pi);
return 0;
}
BOB RELOADED
When not having access qualifies 
as a disability…
BOB RELOADED
• Install exploit code using maintenance disk
• Open back door at Winlogon desktop with 
osk.exe
• Limited resources XP 
• taskmgr
• Network access
• Using memory tools “Password grab”
• CreateProcessAsUser and Impersonating the 
security context of a logged on user.
BOB RELOADED
• Open back door at Winlogon desktop on W2K3 
server
• Resources
• Run explorer “full desktop”
• There is more than one way to use this:
• Create LocalSystem shell on Default desktop with 
Magnifier
Exploit “Is this real?”
• Is this a real threat?
• Why it is…
• Potential impact to security
• Possible real word scenarios
• Other exploits could follow this same method
• Unknown exploits are stopped with Defense 
in Depth tactics
Basic Protection
• How do I protect my systems from this 
exploit?
• Group policy (maybe)
• Remove or disable utilmgr
• Disable boot CDROM - lock BIOS
• Host IDS on servers
“The Big Picture”
• Preventing back door exploits by 
employees:
• Policies
• Separation of duties
• Application, system verification and testing 
before deployment
“The Big Picture”
• Preventing non-employee access
• Who is that maintenance man and what do you 
really know about the night janitors?
• Using social engineering to gain physical 
access “security awareness training”
• Contractual agreements with contractors and 
outsourcers “whether it’s janitorial or 
application development”
“The Big Picture”
• Defense in Depth “The only effective 
method to defend your network”
• Combination of people, processes and 
technology
• Applied at each layer. If one layer is 
compromised your entire organization is not 
compromised
• Policy, physical, perimeter, internal network, 
host, application and data
Now its your turn…
• What methods do you use to secure your 
environment?
• Do you follow defense in depth principles? 
• What would you do different?
