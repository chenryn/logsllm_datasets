Paste this snippet in the playground:
    const result = [{ foo: 'hello' }]
        .map(({ foo }) => foo)
        .map(foo => foo);
If you hover over `foo` in the first `map()` call, you'll notice that its type
is `any` (should be `string`).
The type of `result` is correctly inferred to be `string[]`, though. It just
seems that there is no type information for destructured function parameters.
