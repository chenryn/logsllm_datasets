### Problem description
Example: `Hidden` API docs `import type {HiddenProps} from './types'`. This is
done to prevent a cyclic dependency problem, as the `HiddenProps` are imported
by three (to be four) files:
  1. `Hidden`
  2. `HiddenJs`
  3. `HiddenCss` (TBD)
  4. `Grid` (tight integration with `Hidden`)
I am very strongly against duplicating props just so we have documentation. In
this case, we have two public components so we would probably have three
copies of a reasonably extensive set of properties.
This is not the lone case, as our responsive components reference `type
Breakpoint` as well, though this one seems easier as it is a bit simpler.
I raised an issue and learned that react-docgen doesn't resolve imported
types. I have been thinking about the solution. Duplication is a last resort
and I don't think we are there yet.
Note that this is _not specific to use of flow_ , it is also a problem
importing reusable prop-types.
I am open to ideas on solutions. It is something that must be addressed before
`next` is generally available.
