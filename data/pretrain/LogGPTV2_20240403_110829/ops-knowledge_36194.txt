User: I have a python script which adds a user using the command os.system('useradd user'). This code works fine when run like a python script like this sudo python script.py. However, once I convert it to executable with pyinstaller with the command python pyinstaller.py --onefile script.py, and run the executable like this sudo ./script, I get an error useradd: error while loading shared libraries: libselinux.so.1: failed to map segment from shared object: Permission denied. Any idea what is the issue and how to fix?
Assistant: Looks like os.system('sudo useradd user') solved the issue.
