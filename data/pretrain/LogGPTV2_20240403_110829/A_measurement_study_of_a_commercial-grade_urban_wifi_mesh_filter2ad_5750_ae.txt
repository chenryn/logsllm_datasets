measure of the amount of load experienced by that MAP.
The client distribution across the MAPs also helps us iden-
tify ‘client hotspots’ and accordingly deploy more MAPs in
that region to evenly distribute the load across the access
points. In Figure 17 we plot the number of clients connected
to each MAP averaged over the period of study. The MAPs
are sorted in the decreasing order of the average number of
clients connected to them. We observe that certain MAPs
are much more popular when compared to the others, with
the average varying from around 7 to less than 1. The ﬁgure
also shows the 25, 50, 75 and 95 percentiles of the number of
the clients and the corresponding number of MAPs to which
these clients are connected. For example, one can see that
around 50% of the clients are connected to 40 most popu-

lar MAPs which account for only 20% of total the deployed
MAPs. We also ﬁnd that many of the MAPs are lightly
loaded in the mesh network with around 110 MAPs having
on an average less than one user connected to them.
Spatial distribution of clients
In Figure 2, we show the spatial distribution of the clients
using the mesh network where each MAP is represented by
a circle. The size of the circle represents the average number
of clients connected to the MAP. We can clearly observe the
uneven distribution of the clients across the coverage area.
More importantly, we note that the most of the popular
MAPs (the MAPs with higher number of clients connected
to them on an average) are concentrated in the area depicted
which is a popular area near the downtown. Further, in this
region we can observe the formation of a small number of
clusters in the areas depicted by B2, B3 and B4. We note
that there are several student dormitories in the area B2
which can explain its popularity. While B3 is very popular
among the people with a high number of coﬀee shops and
restaurants concentrated in that area, B4 is popular because
of an open park where student activity is prominent.
Hop count and number of clients
The distribution of the number of clients across the diﬀerent
hops of a network informs us about how good the deploy-
ment is. In a well planned deployment, one can expect to
see most of the clients connected to network to be within a
few hops. If there are popular MAPs at a higher hop count,
network planners might deploy a RAP in the area in order

to reduce the hop count. Figure 9 shows the distribution of
the clients across diﬀerent hops of the deployed mesh net-
work. We observe that around 15% of the clients are directly
connected to the RAPs and amongst the other MAPs, the
number of clients decrease with increase in the hopcount.
In particular, we observe that around 85% of the clients are
connected to the network within 3 hops. We note that this
distribution is similar to the distribution of MAPs (Figure
8) shown earlier because a large fraction of the deployed
MAPs are also at a lower hop count.
Distribution of MAPs with high packet losses
We observed that some of the MAPs had experienced a
packet error rate of more than 35%. On further investi-
gation, we observed that most of these MAPs had a very
low number of clients connected to them. We also observed
that the MAPs with similar packet error rates are clustered
together representing the regions of high and low interfer-
ence on the access links. For example, we observe that the
MAPs in the area B4 experience very low packet losses as
they are deployed in open park. On the other hand, the
MAPs with higher packet error rates are clustered in near
B3 where there are other WiFi networks causing interfer-
ence.
7. RELATED WORK
In this section we present a summary of previous work
being done on the study of wireless network deployments.
A substantial body of research has already been conducted
on evaluation of the performance characteristics of wireless
networks. Studies reported in [20, 21] utilize SNMP traces
to understand the performance of wireless networks. Specif-
ically, Kotz et. al. [21, 20] present a comprehensive study of
the usage patterns (application popularity, temporal varia-
tion in utilization etc.), of a campus wide WLAN network.
Aguayo et. al report their ﬁndings on the link level charac-
teristics of an 802.11b rooftop based mesh network in [11].
The network is deployed in a urban city. Their study focuses
on the link level characteristics of the deployment. In con-
trast, we present results on the quality of the deployment
and the application level performance of our network along
with link level characteristics of the network.
Chebrolu et. al. [12] and Sheth et. al [9] also study the
link level characteristics of outdoor mesh networks, however
their work is applicable to rural settings. Our study was
done on a commercial mesh while all of the above mentioned
studies were conducted on custom testbeds built explicitly
for experimentation.
The work by Knightly et. al reports a measurement study
of a mesh network deployment in [9] and highlights the im-
portance of measurements in accurately planning and pro-
visioning mesh networks. While their deployment is has a
two-tier architecture as well, their deployment operates ex-
clusively in 2.4 GHz settings while ours operates in both 2.4
GHz and 5 GHz. Also, the span of MadMesh network (250
nodes) is far bigger than their deployment (18 nodes). We
summarize and contrast the our measurement study with
prior work on mesh network deployments in Table 2. As
can be seen from the table, the unique features of our study
are, a) our deployment has a far bigger scale in terms of
nodes deployed b) use of two type of RF bands for network
operation (802.11 a & b), and c) the commercial nature of
the MadMesh deployment.
At the time of publication, we became aware of two in-
dependent pieces of work performed concurrently with ours,
that evaluated diﬀerent aspects of a metropolitan-area mesh
network whose scale was similar to this study. The ﬁrst of
them is work by Knightly et. al [22] that estimated the
coverage properties of the Google WiFi mesh network de-
ployed in and around downtown Mountain View, CA. The
other is work by Afanasyev et. al [23] that observes the us-
age characteristics for diﬀerent user device classes (such as
smartphones, stationary modems, etc.) in the same Google
WiFi mesh, focusing on application workloads, mobility pat-
terns, and device popularity at diﬀerent locations. Both
these eﬀorts complement our measurement study, and to-
gether help provide a greater understanding of diﬀerent as-
pects of a metro-area WiFi mesh.
8. CONCLUSION
This paper presents the ﬁrst systematic study of a com-
mercial grade wireless mesh network deployed in an urban
setting. We ﬁnd that the planned part of the network (back-
bone) is performing far better than the access side. This dis-
parity in performance is mostly a result of unmitigated in-
terference in 2.4 GHz spectrum in urban settings. The study
also presents a set of interesting statistics on the actual us-
age of the mesh network, which would help in customization
of future deployments to make them more proﬁtable. We
also present a set of lessons which if followed would result
in more robust deployments and stabler routing algorithms
in future.
Finally, the study throws open a set of immediate next
steps that need to be carefully addressed in real deployments
to make mesh networks viable. Some examples include (i)
a better architectural design to mitigate interference on the
client access link, (ii) design of mechanisms to detect topol-
ogy robustness in a global sense, (iii) strategies to mitigate
route ﬂapping, as common metrics that determine routing
changes frequently, and (iv) utilization of client feedback in
management of these networks.
