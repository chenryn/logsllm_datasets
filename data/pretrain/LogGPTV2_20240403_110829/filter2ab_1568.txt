ATT&CK ID:S0603
ATT&CK Technique Name:Stuxnet
Stuxnet infects DLL's associated with the WinCC Simatic manager which are responsible for opening project files. If a user opens an uninfected project file using a compromised manager, the file will be infected with Stuxnet code. If an infected project is opened with the Simatic manager, the modified data file will trigger a search for the xyz.dll file. If the xyz.dll file is not found in any of the specified locations, the malicious DLL will be loaded and executed by the manager. [7]
