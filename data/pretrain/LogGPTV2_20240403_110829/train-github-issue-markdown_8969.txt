### System info
  * Playwright Version: v1.31
  * Operating System: Windows 11
  * Browser: Edge/WebView2
  * Other info: It is probably for all system and browsers, but checked only in this one
### Source code
  * I provided exact source code that allows reproducing the issue locally.
**Test file (pseudocode)**
    it('should check element is not leaking', async ({ page }) => {
      await Promise.all([
        () => page.locator('//*[@id="should_not_leak'div"]').waitFor({ state: 'attached' }), 
        () => page.setContent(``) 
      ])
    });
**Steps**
  * [Run the test]
  * [...]
**Expected**
There is no detached div element at the end of the test
**Actual**
Playwright leaks element(s) found by locators, if there is `waitFor` called on
them, due to internally used Handles and not disposing them.
