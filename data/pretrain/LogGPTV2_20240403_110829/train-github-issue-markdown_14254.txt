# Environment
    Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18362.175]
    terminal version 0.2.1715.0
# Steps to reproduce
I have a Canadian Multilingual keyboard ant to do a pipe symbol I have to use
the right alt and the key before the 1 on a us layout I don't kown which one
it is but on my keyboard is a slash (/).
# Expected behavior
Able to write a "|" without pasting it and able to copy thing in the terminal
window.
# Actual behavior
The other bug I found is that I can't copy paste something. Normally, with
quick edit enable you do select the text + "enter" or right click on the
window title copy. The paste works.
