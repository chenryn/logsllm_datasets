Next, we analyze and compare the security of the three proposed
behavioral biometrics schemes against the above-defined attack.
Security of S-Pattern: If the attacker is able to record the user’s
valid interaction with the authentication construct underlying the
S-Pattern scheme, it can theoretically fool the authentication sys-
tem simply by replaying the recorded values (given the ability we
explained above as part of the attack). However, for a real-world
attacker (e.g., a robot with physical constraints or a human im-
personator), such an attack is not straight forward as the attacker
needs to mimic the user interaction with the device measured by
the touch screen sensor and the motion-position sensors on the
device.
Security of CR-Pattern: CR-Pattern is harder to attack compared
to S-Pattern as the randomization/interactivity in CR-Pattern adds
an extra burden on the attacker. Simply recording and replaying
the user interactions do not allow the attacker to bypass the secu-
rity provided by this scheme. To attack the CR-Pattern scheme, the
362attacker needs to understand the pattern it needs to re-enter, then
try to mimic the user. However, mimicking, in this case, is harder
as replaying previously recorded values will not work because the
pattern shown at a given time is typically different from the one pre-
viously shown and recorded. The attacker can try to learn the user’s
way of interaction with the scheme by recording multiple sessions
and then trying to input the new pattern mimicking the user utiliz-
ing the learned knowledge. This suggests that CR-Pattern is much
more robust to impersonation attacks compared to S-Pattern, which
is the inherent benefit of using challenge-response authentication
in CR-Pattern.
Security of Gametrics: In order to solve a Gametrics challenge,
the attacker needs to understand the content of the images, find
the relationships between the target and moving objects, and then
drag and drop the answer objects to their corresponding target.
To be able to bypass this scheme, the attacker needs to mimic the
user interactions with the challenges measured by the touchscreen,
motion and position sensors. Moreover, the attacker needs to match
the timing of solving the challenge with the legitimate user (i.e.,
match the cognitive features).
We argue that attacking such biometrics with a human attack is
challenging as the attacker needs to match about 70 features used in
our classification models. Automated attacks against Gametrics are
considerably hard. This is because solving the challenge involves
solving two hard AI problems: (1) understanding the contents of
the images, and (2) finding the semantic relationships. Such type of
challenges is considered hard for automated algorithms to solve and,
in fact, this scheme has been suggested to be used as CAPTCHAs
[26], a method to determine if the user is a human or a bot.
In summary, interactivity and randomization in Gametrics al-
low us to extract more features that can help in identifying the
user. Moreover, they make attacking such challenges harder as the
requirement of mimicking many features including the cognitive
features.
9 DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this work, we studied three different schemes for authenticating
the user on mobile devices based on behavioral biometrics. The
three schemes differ each other in terms of their usability and se-
curity. Since S-Pattern involves a short authentication time, it has
relatively high usability but is vulnerable to various types of imper-
sonation attacks. CR-Pattern and Gametrics have similar completion
time, both of them have better security compared to S-Pattern. We
argued that the randomization in CR-Pattern and Gametrics makes
the attack harder against them, more harder in the case of Gamet-
rics due to cognitive behavioral properties.
Our study shows that utilizing the sensors in three studied
schemes improves the accuracy of identifying the user. Moreover,
utilizing additional features makes the attack harder as the attacker
needs to mimic all the features to be authenticated.
The most common and traditional mechanism for authentication
in mobile phones is password. Previous work has shown that the
average time taken by the users to enter a password on a mobile
device is up to 21 seconds [25]. Unlike the password, the proposed
schemes require relatively short time to solve the challenges (about
1 second for S-Pattern, and around 6.5 seconds for CR-Pattern and 8
seconds for Gametrics), and can fit well for many application scenar-
ios. S-Pattern seems more viable for the purpose of phone locking
(point-of-entry authentication) while the other two methods seem
amenable for the purpose of app authentication (such as banking
apps or locking photos for users who are concerned about their
photo privacy) or web-site authentication.
Gametrics may be incorporated with graphical passwords [7, 35],
such as those involving Random Arts images [29], objects (PassOb-
jects) [41] and faces (PassFaces) [5], as well as on recall or cued
recall, such as those involving drawings [16, 21] and selection of
points on an image (PassPoints) [40], as a second factor authen-
tication to improve the security of the graphical passwords from
spoofing attacks. Gametrics may also be used as a method for fall-
back authentication. Typically, fall-back authentication does not
require fast authentication time as it is not used often by the users.
However, in order to build an up-to-date classification model for
the user to fall-back, the system may need to ask the user to solve
challenges periodically. As an additional use case, the three studied
schemes can be used to confirm that the user is the one she claims
to be in cases, for example, when the continuous authentication
schemes cannot recognize the user with high probability. Further
investigation is needed to realize such use cases of the studied
schemes. In our future work, we will study different variant of
interactive user authentication with the aim to reduce the time
required during the authentication process. We will also study how
the performance of the biometrics changes with the change in the
device used.
The proposed biometrics would suffer, like any behavioral bio-
metrics, from degradation in classification accuracy in case of user’s
behavioral changes, such as emotional changes [17] or sickness.
We plan to study the effect of such behavioral changes in our fu-
ture work. Moreover, we will study the effect of walking, driving,
and other motion scenarios on the authentication accuracy. The
results of our study are promising, however, more work is needed
to reduce the authentication time, test the proposed schemes on
larger/varying pool of users, and compare the three schemes in
terms of user perception and acceptability.
10 RELATED WORK
The most studied approaches for behavioral biometrics on smar-
phones are based on touchstroke footprints and implicit behavioral
gestures. Only few researches (e.g., [2, 13]) studied user authentica-
tion based on user’s cognitive abilities. Al Galib et al. [2] studied the
ability of authenticating the users based on their cognitive process
captured by visual search, working memory and priming effect on
automatic processing. The game they utilized to capture the users’
cognitive abilities provides a challenge-response task. In each in-
stance of the challenge-response, the user is given a challenge,
which is an object. The user’s task is to drag the challenge object
onto the matching object inside the search set. After a valid drop,
the user then receives a gold coin as a reward and deposits it in a
bank. On a correct deposit, the user is challenged with a new object
and the game continues as before. From the interaction with the
challenges, the authors extracted several features that capture the
cognitive abilities of the users, however, they did not look into the
mouse dynamics biometrics of the users. Chen et al. [13] proposed a
363method to solve account hijacking and share problems in an online
gaming environment. They propose identifying the user based on
her gameplay activities. They show that the idle time distribution is
a representative feature of game players. They propose the relative
entropy test RET scheme, which is based on the Kullback-Leibler
divergence between idle time (i.e., the idle periods between suc-
cessive moves of a player-controlled character) distributions, for
user identification. Their evaluation shows that the RET scheme
achieves higher than 90% accuracy with a 20-minute detection time
given a 200-minute history size.
Many behavioral biometric based authentication mechanisms
on mobile devices have been proposed. Conti et al. [14] proposed
a system that transparently authenticates the user by analyzing
her hand movement gesture while she is making or answering a
phone call. It uses accelerometer and orientation sensor to detect
the proposed gesture. The system uses the dynamic time warping
distance (DTW-D) algorithm to verify if the authorized user is
making or answering the phone call. Buriro et al. [9] introduced
similar authentication system, AnswerAuth, based on the way the
user slides the lock button on the screen to unlock the phone and
the implicit gesture of bringing the phone towards the ear. It utilizes
multiple built-in sensors, such as accelerometer, gyroscope, gravity,
magnetometer, and touchscreen, to capture the said gestures, and
employs machine learning algorithms to detect the sliding and
phone-lifting actions.
Buriro et al. [10] have also proposed another bimodal authenti-
cation system, DialerAuth, for smartphone based on the user touch-
stroke pattern and generated phone movements. The proposed
system requires the user to tap/enter a random non-secret 10-digit
number. It utilizes tap-timing to capture touchstroke pattern while
entering the 10-digit number and uses accelerometer and gyroscope
sensors to capture the device micro-movements. Similarly, Akhtar
et al. [1] introduced multimodal user identification system. Unlike
DialerAuth, the proposed system employs user’s facial features in
addition to phone-movements and touchstrokes patterns to trans-
parently authenticate the user. Similar to DialerAuth, it requires the
user to enter a random 8-digit number. It employs device’s camera
to capture facial features, accelerometer, gravity, and magnetometer
sensors to record device movements and touch sensors for touch-
stroke pattern. Van Nguyen et al. [39] proposed Draw-A-Pin, a user
authentication system for touch-enabled devices based on PIN and
PIN drawing characteristics. In this scheme, user is asked to draw
his PIN on the touch screen of the device instead of typing it on
a keypad. It employs touch sensors to capture the PIN drawing
characteristics.
Further, Buriro et al. [11] have proposed a user authentication
scheme on smartphone after the user has unlocked the phone.
The proposed scheme is based on the profile of the user’s hand
micro-movement while the user is using his phone after it has
been unlocked. It leverages built-in sensors, such as accelerometer,
gyroscope, magnetometer, and orientation, to capture the micro-
movement of the user’s hands. It compares the captured hand move-
ments profile with the stored template utilizing machine learning
algorithms to authenticate the user.
Gascon et al. [19] and Lee et al. [22] presented an approach to
continuously authenticate users on smartphones by analyzing their
typing motion behavior. Both approaches utilizes built-in motion
and position sensors (e.g., accelerometer and gyroscope) to capture
behavioral biometrics so as to authenticate the user. Lee et al. also
utilizes auxiliary motion information from a wearable wrist-device
(e.g., smartwatch) on their authentication system.
11 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we studied two challenge-response methods for be-
havioral biometric authentication on mobile devices and compared
them with an existing static graphical pattern biometric scheme.
For each of the studied schemes, we show that utilizing the motion
sensors improves the accuracy of detecting the user and security
against impersonation attack. Moreover, we argued that utilizing
challenge-response schemes improves the security of the authenti-
cation, although with an increase in the time taken to authenticate
the user (but still less than 10 seconds). Our study shows that game-
based biometric scheme has a similar accuracy and completion time
as the challenge-response pattern biometric scheme, but it has a
higher level of security. Our results suggest that each of the three
schemes may be used in different applications depending upon the
desired level of security and usability.
