# Bug report
## Describe the bug
Using `next/link` to visit a page inside a directory only changes the URL but
doesn't load the page unless you reload the website.
    .
    ├── index.jsx
    └── test
        └── index.jsx (broken)
## To Reproduce
  1. Create a page at `./pages/test/index.jsx` with the following contents
    export default () => Test Page
  2. Create another page at `./pages/index.jsx` with the following contents
    import Link from 'next/link'
    export default () => Go to Test
  3. Visit `/test` in your browser
  4. Notice that the page says _Test Page_
  5. Visit `/`
  6. Click _Go to Test_
  7. Notice that the URL changed but the page didn't
  8. Reload the website
  9. Notice that the page is now `/test` again
## Expected behavior
The user should be sent to where they want to go without having to reload the
page.
