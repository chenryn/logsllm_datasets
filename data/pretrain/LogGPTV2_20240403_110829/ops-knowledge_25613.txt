### Optimized Workflow for Uploading Files to Blobstore and Saving Information to a Model

To efficiently upload files to the blobstore while saving information about the blob and other fields to a model record, follow this streamlined workflow:

1. **Create the Form View:**
   - Design your form with the necessary fields, including the file input for the blobstore.
   - Use `blobstore.create_upload_url` to generate the URL for the form's action attribute.

2. **Handle the Form Submission:**
   - When the form is submitted, the request will be directed to the URL specified by `create_upload_url`.
   - In the view handling this URL, retrieve the POST data and instantiate the form class with the same structure as the initial form.

3. **Validate the Form:**
   - Check if the form is valid using the form's validation methods.
   - If the form is valid, save the form data along with the `BlobInfo.key` to the appropriate model.
   - If the form is not valid, store the form errors in a temporary storage mechanism (e.g., memcache) with a short expiration time.

4. **Redirect with Errors:**
   - If the form is invalid, redirect back to the original form view.
   - Pass the key of the stored errors in the URL as a query parameter (e.g., `?error_key=memcache_key`).

5. **Retrieve and Display Errors:**
   - In the original form view, check for the presence of the error key in the URL.
   - If the error key is present, retrieve the form errors from memcache using the provided key.
   - Populate the form with the retrieved errors and display them to the user.

6. **Resubmit the Form:**
   - Allow the user to correct the errors and resubmit the form.
   - Repeat the process until the form is valid and the data is saved successfully.

### Example Implementation

Here is a more detailed example of how you can implement this workflow:

1. **Form View (Initial Page):**
   ```python
   from google.appengine.ext import blobstore
   from google.appengine.ext.webapp import blobstore_handlers
   from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
   from .forms import MyForm
   from .models import MyModel
   from google.appengine.api import memcache

   def create_form_view(request):
       upload_url = blobstore.create_upload_url('/upload')
       if 'error_key' in request.GET:
           error_key = request.GET['error_key']
           form_errors = memcache.get(error_key)
           form = MyForm(form_errors)
       else:
           form = MyForm()
       return render(request, 'form.html', {'form': form, 'upload_url': upload_url})
   ```

2. **Upload Handler:**
   ```python
   class UploadHandler(blobstore_handlers.BlobstoreUploadHandler):
       def post(self):
           form = MyForm(self.request.POST)
           if form.is_valid():
               # Save the form data and BlobInfo.key to the model
               blob_info = self.get_uploads()[0]
               my_model = MyModel(
                   field1=form.cleaned_data['field1'],
                   field2=form.cleaned_data['field2'],
                   blob_key=blob_info.key()
               )
               my_model.put()
               return redirect('success_page')
           else:
               # Store form errors in memcache
               error_key = 'form_errors_' + str(time.time())
               memcache.set(error_key, form.errors, time=60)  # Expire in 60 seconds
               return redirect('/form?error_key=' + error_key)
   ```

3. **Success Page:**
   ```python
   def success_page(request):
       return render(request, 'success.html')
   ```

By following this structured approach, you can ensure that the form submission process is smooth, and any errors are handled gracefully and presented to the user for correction.
