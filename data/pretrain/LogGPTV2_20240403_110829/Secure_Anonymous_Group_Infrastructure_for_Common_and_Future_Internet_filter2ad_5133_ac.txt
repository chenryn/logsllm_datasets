(cid:1) The access management block is enhanced
with a pseudonym based authentication mecha-
nism: Each user is given a randomly generated
pseudonym upon veriﬁcation of the credentials
he presented during the authentication process.
(cid:1) The management of the group keys used for
data trafﬁc encryption and for conﬁdential and
authenticated distribution of the group manage-
ment information is done by standard secure
group techniques or methods that draw proﬁt
of the group topology such as the one-to-many
scheme described in [21]. The Internet learning
application, e.g., uses a one-to-many scheme that
scales to large, dynamic groups for lectures and a
many-to-few scheme for written exams. Further-
more, we need to include pseudonymity aware-
ness in the addressing schemes used for mem-
bers.
(cid:1) Finally, we need to add the required network in-
frastructure – the SAM servers – allowing for
users to remain unknown to outsiders or to both
outsiders and the group.
The SAM servers joining on behalf of the users
that wish to remain unknown to both the group and
any outsiders are treated as normal members of the
group and play their expected role in the chosen
group key management technique. However, the true
members, i.e. the anonymised group members, re-
ceive the secure group communication through the
SAM server. Therefore, we use the SNAP (Secure Non
local Anonymising Protocol) architecture described in
[12]. Thereby, we inherit the user administration and
persona generator service on one hand and, most im-
portantly, the users are protected from any malicious
observer in their local environment due to the pro-
tected transmission between SAM server and user.

The implications of the usage of the SNAP architec-
ture on the simpliﬁed secure multicast framework are
many-folded: First, the new SAM server derived from
the SNAP server must be able to join a secure multi-
cast group. Therefore, we included a key management
component in our design and implementation (see
Figure 5). Its task is to organise the keys used in every
secure multicast groups it participates in. Second, we
need to administrate the keys and credentials given
by the SAM user to the server to join a group. This
includes the administration of the keys and the au-
thorisation credentials. Finally, the SAM server should
distribute the received multicasted data to the enti-
tled users and send the user’s data encrypted and/or

3.3 Special Cases
3.3.1 Degenerated Cases
We distinguish between two degenerated cases such
as depicted in Figure 6: The ﬁrst only includes anony-
mous participants in the secure multicast group with-
out any normal members. The second one includes
only normal users. This case is equivalent to the case
of a secure multicast group with the exception that no
member of the group can claim to know that there are
only normal members. Only a collusion of all mem-
bers could reveal this fact. As long as there is one
member not colluding, he could be assumed to be a
SAM server.
Both cases do not require a change in the building
blocks. They are handled as “normal” distributed sce-
narios.

If a SAM server reaches a critical number of users
subscribed through it to the same secure multicast
group, it may include all these users in a second secure
multicast group as depicted in Figure 7. Of course, this
second group will only include users that are have
at their disposal the required technology to join a se-
cure multicast group. For this case, we extended the
anonymous multicast server in the SAM server with a
dummy trafﬁc generating engine as commonly used
in mixes (see Section 2 for a description of the mix
technique).
3.3.3 Certiﬁcations
A special access management scheme was included in
the order to allow for fair, semi-blinded examinations.
We introduce certiﬁed pseudonyms for students. The
protocol for a student S who desires to take a semi-
blinded examination of examiner E is as follows:
1. S checks if E allows for semi-blinded examina-
tions in the digitally signed course description. In
case of a negative answer, semi-blinded examina-
tions are not possible for this course.
2. In the case of a positive answer, S requests a cer-
tiﬁcation of his pseudonym P used in the course
from the certiﬁcation authority of the university.
Therefore, he needs to proof that the pseudonym
P is bound to his real identity in an unalterable
manner by his SAM server. The certiﬁcation au-
thority stores the certiﬁcate in a safe fashion and
puts the pseudonym together with the timing in-
formation of the exam on the access list for the
secure multicast group of the examination.
3. S joins this group anonymously through the indi-
cated SAM server at the time of the exam.
4. E grades the signed performance of P and for-
wards the grade to the certiﬁcation authority and
to the pseudonymous user P.
4 Evaluation
4.1 Scalability of the SAM framework
The SAM server, until now referred to as one server
per local environment, may consist of a network of
SAM servers for scalability reasons such reducing the
trust required. Therefore, techniques such as Onion
Routing or the Freedom network (Section 2) are em-
ployed.
4.2 Complexity Analysis
The additional costs for the SAM architecture orig-
inate from two improvements on a typical group ar-
chitecture: (1) the introduction of anonymity mecha-
nisms, and (2) the usage of secure group communica-
tion.
The latter one is heavily dependent on the used
group key management scheme. The communication
costs of the most frequent operations in centralised

4.3 Resistance to Attacks
The resistance of the SAM framework to the de-
ﬁned attacks cannot be given at a general level be-
cause it depends on the exact conﬁguration used.
A near ideal setup uses SAM servers organised
as in the onion routing approach with pseudonym
based authentication and dummy trafﬁc generation.
The SAM servers will not only process multicast traf-
ﬁc, but also the traditional trafﬁc of the SNAP server:
e-mails, web browsing and other TCP based trafﬁc.

5 Conclusions
Table 4. Communication costs (in terms of multi-
cast size) of the most frequent operations in com-
mon secure multicast approaches.
The impact of the anonymisation depends on both
the number of users per SAM server and the total
number of SAM servers. The ﬁrst factor gives an in-
dication for the number of additional unicast sessions
needed. The second factor speciﬁes the number of ad-
ditional joins in the secure multicast group. So, the
mechanisms in each building block of the SAM frame-
In summary, the SAM framework provides an en-
vironment for anonymous group communication de-
rived from a general purpose and application inde-
pendent secure multicast framework build on top of
state-of-the-art technology. The exact composition of
the framework is conﬁgurable by the application, e.g.
the application decides on the access mechanisms or
if encryption algorithms are mandatory.
The usage of network of SAM servers for scalability
reasons reduces the trust required in each of the indi-
vidual servers.
Furthermore, we prevent observers in the local en-
vironment of the user from learning any information
about the trafﬁc transmitted between SAM server and

user. This property called local anonymity is inherited
from the SNAP server.
Finally, the SAM framework allows for hybrid au-
thentication mechanisms. Some application require
only registered users to participate, but after authenti-
cation, they have no interest in which particular user
send which message. An example of such an appli-
cation is a virtual casino: A player must reveal some
personal identiﬁcation such as age and ﬁnancial in-
formation for legal and operational reasons when he
changes money to playing chips. But the information
on which game he wins his chips should not be acces-
sible. In other words, once he got the chips, he should
remain anonymous in the virtual casino. The simplest
solution for this approach in the SAM framework is a
pseudonym based solution.
Further research on this topic will encompass
(1) the analysis of the behaviour of different applica-
tions in the SAM framework with respect to selected
authentication methods and group management tech-
niques, (2) the quantitative evaluation of the differ-
ent components concerning performance and usabil-
ity, and (3) the theoretical assessment of the degrees of
anonymity resp. pseudonymity achieved with respect
to the deﬁned attacks.
