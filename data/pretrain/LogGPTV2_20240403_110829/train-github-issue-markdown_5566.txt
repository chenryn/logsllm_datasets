note I wrote similar details here but haven't gotten an answer:  
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59291287/trouble-installing-pytorch-from-
source
### **Background**
As mentioned in the above link, I'm trying to compile from source due to my
GPU being old and support for it has been removed per the thread:
https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/pytorch-no-longer-supports-this-gpu-because-it-
is-too-old/13803. I found someone with similar errors (I think) here: #20420
but haven't had any luck. I've uninstalled everything including anaconda,
pytorch, cuda, visual studio, python and reinstalled (with cuda being
installed after visual studio) but nothing has worked. I'm really unsure what
the issue could be tbh. Some additional notes that I'm not sure are relevant:
my main drive is C but I have most things including Cuda installed on E, I'm
running the python setup.py install command from within an anaconda terminal,
not sure if thats whats I'm supposed to do, the readme repeatedly refers to
anaconda so all the dependencies and stuff are installed only there. Also i've
literally never installed something by compiling it from source before so its
possible im doing something very basic wrong. I've been at it a while
(multiple weeks off and on) and scoured every relevant page I could find
though so I really hope not. Also I'm using VS17 but was doing it with 19
before without luck.
### **LOGS**
I have 2 logs from a ninja and non ninja build here:
