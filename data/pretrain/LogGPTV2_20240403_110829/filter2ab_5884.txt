### Title: Rope: Bypassing Behavioral Detection of Malware with Distributed ROP-Driven Execution

**Abstract:**

Distributed malware concepts pose significant challenges to the behavioral detection capabilities of antivirus (AV) and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions. These techniques dilute the temporal and spatial characteristics of malicious activities across multiple processes, making it harder for security systems to identify and mitigate threats. Several prominent malware families have already adopted a modular design, where distinct features are delegated to cooperating individual components. Recent research has taken this approach further by splitting the code of a single component into smaller chunks, which are then executed by emulators injected into multiple processes.

However, these approaches often rely on conspicuous features and primitives that make them easily detectable by advanced AV or EDR systems. Additionally, they may conflict with operating system (OS) mitigations designed to harden processes.

In this presentation, we introduce **Rope**, a novel covert distributed execution technique. **Rope** leverages transactional NTFS as a non-inspectable covert channel for payload distribution and execution coordination. It also employs return-oriented programming (ROP) to encode the desired actions, thereby minimizing indicators of compromise (IoCs) on the target machine. For example, **Rope** does not require any read-write-execute (RWX) memory regions, which is a common IoC for many security solutions.

Return-oriented programming is central to achieving the desired properties of our design and offers several advantages against code-based detections. To implement **Rope**, we developed a stealthy and user-friendly injection primitive that temporarily hijacks threads from potentially hardened processes, initiating the distributed execution.

Every technique used in **Rope** complies with currently available Windows 10 mitigations or bypasses them in innovative ways, which will be detailed in the presentation. Our **Rope** malware samples have successfully evaded detection by popular AV and EDR solutions, demonstrating the effectiveness of this new approach.

**Key Points:**
- **Distributed Execution:** Dilutes malicious activities across multiple processes.
- **Covert Channel:** Utilizes transactional NTFS for secure and non-inspectable communication.
- **Return-Oriented Programming (ROP):** Encodes actions to minimize IoCs and evade detection.
- **Stealth Injection:** Temporarily hijacks threads from hardened processes.
- **Compliance and Bypass:** Adheres to or innovatively bypasses current Windows 10 mitigations.
- **Evasion Success:** Successfully eluded popular AV and EDR solutions.

This talk will provide a comprehensive overview of the **Rope** technique, including its implementation details and the results of our testing against various security solutions.
