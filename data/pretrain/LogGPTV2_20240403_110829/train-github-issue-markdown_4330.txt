# Bug report
## Describe the bug
With Next.js 9.0.7, after production build and deployment of directories and
files below listed, the application is unable to start because of the
following error : `Couldn't find a `pages` directory. Please create one under
the project root`. It works well again after rolling back to Next.js 9.0.6.
Deployed files and folders:
  * `.next`
  * `data`
  * `node_modules`
  * `static`
  * `next.config.js`
  * `package.json`
  * `pm2.config.js`
## To Reproduce
Build a minimal application with Next.js 9.0.7 and deploy it without /pages
source folder.
## Expected behavior
Built application should run without source files.
## System information
  * OS: Debian 8.5
  * Version of Node.js: 10.16.3
  * Version of Next.js: 9.0.6/9.0.7
