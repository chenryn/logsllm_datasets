### Region of Interest (RoI) Definition

We consider 19x19 pixel regions in the image corners as RoIs, regardless of the image's guiding features.

### Segmentation and Labeling

Each 19x19 pixel RoI is labeled based on the detected object type within its boundaries. For example, an RoI is labeled as an "eye" if it falls within the boundary of a detected eye. If the RoI overlaps with multiple objects, it is labeled with the object closest to the RoI's center point. If no objects are detected, the RoI is labeled as "NONE."

### Relating Detected Objects to ACP

Table 2 shows that, on average, 53% of ACPs were predicted by the detected RoIs. The lowest percentages were observed in images 2, 7, 5, and 1, likely due to their simple content. For instance, Image 2 (Figure 3a) features a small jet against a plain sky, and Image 5 (Figure 3d) has a small car logo on an unremarkable car hood. These images have few hotspots, leading users to select regions not detected as RoIs. Image 9, with 81% of ACPs in detected objects, had two prominent faces covering most of the image, providing many detectable objects.

No image had all ACPs related to a detected object, which may be due to a semantic gap between what is detected and what users find important or memorable. Additionally, ACPs often fall in image corners, even where no objects are detected. We artificially added these as "detected" objects because they are easily located by the image boundaries.

### Semantic Gap Between Clicks and Object Detection

The object detection algorithms can predict faces, circles, etc., but cannot determine if the user's attention is drawn to them. Users may choose points based on other memorable links, which the algorithms cannot replicate. For example, image corners are memorable due to the boundaries, but may not contain detectable RoIs.

### Region Selection Likelihood

Tables 2 and 3 show that ACPs frequently fall on detected objects. Intuitively, the click frequency of an RoI indicates the likelihood of future clicks. However, simply calculating the likelihood without considering the RoI's content can lead to inaccuracies. For example, faces are more likely to be chosen in images with faces (e.g., Image 11), but not in images without faces (e.g., Image 5). Thus, the average of 8.3% ACPs on faces is not universally applicable. To improve accuracy, we considered the size and variety of detected objects. For instance, Image 6 has only circle objects, while Image 8 has both faces and circles. The likelihood of clicking on a circle in Image 6 is 55%, but only 4% in Image 8, likely due to the larger circle in Image 6 and the presence of other objects in Image 8.

### Image Categorization

To group similar images, we categorized the 15 images based on their detected objects: F (face), G (generic object), and C (circle). Combinations of these objects are represented as concatenations.
