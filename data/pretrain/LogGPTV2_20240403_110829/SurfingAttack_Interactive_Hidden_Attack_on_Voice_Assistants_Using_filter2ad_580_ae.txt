such a long attack command. We run the experiment 20 times.
The result shows that if the conversation is very loud during the
delivery of “Ok Google” phrase, i.e., > 80dB, it has a 50%
chance that the entire text message will not be recognized.
If the Google assistant is activated by the ﬁrst phrase “Ok
Google”, the entire text message has a 20% chance to have
one word in error after recognition.
Another possible consequence is that extra conversation
sentence may be attached to the end of the text message. We
ﬁnd that: if the conversation volume is greater than 65 dB
measured at 5 cm away from the victim phone, the probability
of recognizing additional conversations is almost 100%. In
such case, we can repeat SurﬁngAttack multiple times until the
attack succeeds. Note that the attachment of additional conver-
sations only occurs with text message commands. For all other
types of commands, due to the speech recognition algorithm,
Google assistant will only consider the short commands while
disregarding attached conversations.
C. Impact of Directionality
The propagation of ultrasound signals in air is known to
be directional. Here, we evaluate the directivity of ultrasonic
guided waves to validate the effectiveness of SurﬁngAttack
when the device is placed in arbitrary positions with arbitrary
orientations on the table. In our experiment, an activation

command (“OK Google”) and a control command (“read my
message”) are used to test the directionality. Since microphone
sensitivity and the casing are different for each of the phones,
we select both Xiaomi Mi 5 and Google Pixel for this
experiment to measure the recognition rates of two commands.
The distance between the transducer and victim device is 30
cm. We evaluate both the impacts of the angle θp (between
the axis of the mobile phone and the direct path) and the
angle θt (between the direct path and the reference horizontal
axis) as shown in Fig. 12. The ﬁrst experiment measures the
recognition rates at different θt with a ﬁxed θp, and the second
experiment adapts θp with a ﬁxed θt. For each command at
each position, we repeat it 20 times and calculate the average
recognition rate. The results of recognition rates for Google
Pixel keep at 100% regardless of its positions and orientations.
The results for Xiaomi Mi 5 are listed in Table IV. The
recognition rates for activation command remain as 100% for
all tests, while the recognition rates of the control command
also exceed 90% for all positions. The results demonstrate
the omni-directionality of ultrasonic guided waves, with which
SurﬁngAttack is able to attack the devices at arbitrary positions
and orientations on the table. In summary, SurﬁngAttack is
omni-directional, which can effectively target any devices
at arbitrary positions and orientations on the tabletop.
D. Impact of Attack Distances
In this section, we evaluate the recognition rates with vari-
ous distances between the attack device and victim device. We
repeatedly launch the activation command (“OK Google”) and
the control command (“read my message”) to a Google Pixel
at regular intervals and compute the probability of successful
attacks. Fig. 13 shows the recognition rate with increasing
distances on a glass table with a maximum length of 85 cm.
With a limited signal power (< 1.5 W ), the attack commands
in the form of ultrasonic guided wave can propagate over a
long distance without affecting the attack effectiveness. This

can be attributed to the high energy conversion efﬁciency of
piezoelectric transducer and the low attenuation of ultrasonic
guided waves. As the activation command contains fewer
words than the control command, the recognition rates of the
activation command are slightly higher than that of the control
command.
Long Distance Attack. In order to execute the attack
experiment over a long distance, we set up a large table
using an Aluminum coil made of 6061 Aluminum alloy, with
the size of 6 inch × 30 feet. We use Google Pixel as our
attack target, with the attack message of “OK Google, read my
message.” To achieve a long distance attack, we amplify the
original signal using a commercial GWBP-AMP-X75 power
ampliﬁer with maximum output power of 1.5W and maximum
output voltage of 30V . The result shows that SurﬁngAttack
successfully attacked Google Pixel phone placed at the furthest
end of this large table with 1.5W attack power and 28.8 KHz
attack frequency fc, with 100% of attack success rate (i.e.,
recognition rate). We believe that the attack distance can extend
even further than 30 feet. However, at the time of writing, the
longest Aluminum coil we were able to purchase was 30 feet.
In addition, we verify that the attack success rate stays above
80% when the attack power is reduced to 0.75W (with 15V
attack signal amplitude). In comparison, the furthest inaudible
attack distance over the air using an ultrasonic speaker array
is up to 30 feet using the attack power of 6W [42]. With 10%
of the attack power, SurﬁngAttack remains at least as effective
over a potentially longer distance on a large Aluminum table.
Fig. 14: Relationship between attack power and distance.
Relationship Between Power and Distance. Given the
large Aluminum table, we further evaluate the relationship be-
tween the attack power and attack distance using Google Pixel
phone as a target. We repeat each attack 20 times, and record
the recognition rates across different distances. Since the attack
recognition rate does not have to be 100% for a successful
attack, we deﬁne the attack distance as the maximum distance
across which the SurﬁngAttack’s recognition rate exceeds 50%.
The result is presented in Fig. 14, which shows that the attack
distance has a positive correlation with the attack power. When
the attack power exceeds 0.8W (with attack signal amplitude
of 15V ), the attack distance reaches 30 feet, the maximum
length of our Aluminum table. It is worth noting that: even
with the highest power, the user will not be able to sense
any vibrations due to the attack signals’ energy delivery form,
as discussed in Section V-D. In summary, SurﬁngAttack can
effectively attack the voice assistants placed far away from
the attack device with high attack success rate.
E. Inﬂuences of Table Materials
The performance of SurﬁngAttack is heavily dependent on
both the materials and thicknesses of the tables which deliver
the ultrasonic attack signals to the voice assistants. The mate-
rials or thicknesses of the tables inﬂuence the characteristics
of the guided wave generation, propagation, and mechanical
coupling with the device. We provide a thorough study of
such impacts via both theoretical analysis and experimental
validation on four different types of tables.
Material Inﬂuence Analysis. Four most common table
materials,
i.e., glass, metal, one type of wood: medium-
density ﬁberboard (MDF), and one type of plastic: high-
density polyethylene (HDPE), are selected for impact analysis.
Propagation of Lamb waves depends on the density and the
elastic material properties of the medium, the test frequency,
and material thickness, which are listed in Table X in Ap-
pendix. Fig. 15 displays the phase-velocity dispersion curves
of A0 mode in different tables at 20∼40 kHz attack frequency
range. Different dispersion affects the demodulated commands
since signals at different frequencies propagate in the table at
different speeds. Such effect becomes more signiﬁcant in a
long-range attack.
In addition, given a PZT transducer, the excitation ampli-
tude of the guided wave also depends the thickness. Victor
[18] has proposed a theoretical model to compute the Lamb

Inﬂuence of Table Materials Towards Reception Perfor-
mance of Victim’s Microphone. The reception performance
of the victim’s microphone depends on the table materials, the
difference of which brings in different mechanical coupling
over the boundaries. As the interaction of ultrasonic guided
waves with device boundaries is complicated, we conduct a
qualitative analysis based on acoustic impedance. Ultrasonic
waves are reﬂected at boundaries where there is a difference
in acoustic impedances (Z) of the materials on each side of the
boundary. This difference in Z is commonly referred to as the
impedance mismatch. The greater the impedance mismatch,
the higher the percentage of energy that will be reﬂected at
the interface or boundary between one medium and another.
As for SurﬁngAttack, the more energy that can be delivered
to the device, the greater attack success rate will be observed.
We can calculate the transmitted incident wave intensity based
on the fact that particle velocity and local particle pressures
must be continuous across the boundary. When the acoustic
impedances of the materials on both sides of the boundary
are known, the fraction of the incident wave intensity that is
transmitted through the boundary can be calculated as [5]:
T =
4ZtZd
(Zt + Zd)2 .
(15)
This value is known as transmission coefﬁcient, where Zt
and Zd are the acoustic impedances of table and device,
respectively. The acoustic impedance depends on the density
and speed of sound, as shown in Table X. During the attack, the
transverse wave component in the table is the prime incident
wave, and both longitudinal and transverse wave components
can propagate into the device. The transmission coefﬁcients
of different material pairs for device and table are listed in
Table V. Here, we consider three table materials, and three
device body materials including ceramic, metal, and glass.
Generally, the best energy delivery can be achieved when the
table material is the same as the device body material, which is
the reason why ultrasonic guided waves transmitting in MDF
tables result in lower energy delivery performance.
Evaluation Experiments. We run experiments to evaluate
the maximum attack distances on different tables with a limited
attack power. The results are shown in Table VI. Five tables are
evaluated in this study: an Aluminum metal tabletop with 0.3
mm thickness, a steel metal tabletop with 0.8 mm thickness, a
glass tabletop with 2.54 mm thickness, an MDF tabletop with
5 mm thickness and, an HDPE tabletop with 5 mm thickness.
With a limited attack power, the attacks fail for the HDPE
table, because of both the small acoustic impedance as shown
in Table X and rough matte surface of the tabletop. The results
for other tabletops are shown in Table VI. The experimental
results with different devices validate our theoretical analysis.

in Eq. (14). The equation DA = 0 is the Rayleigh-Lamb
characteristic equation for anti-symmetric modes, and ki are
the simple roots of the dispersion equation. SurﬁngAttack’s
attack frequency range is limited to 20∼40 kHz due to the non-
linearity property of the victim’s microphone. Fig. 16 shows
the predicted maximum amplitude by a 22 mm diameter PZT
in the attack bandwidth w.r.t. the thickness of both glass and
MDF tables. As the thickness increases, the excitation of the
guided wave requires more energy since the energy will be
dispersed across the entire table thickness. However, only the
wave on the tabletop can reach the victim device, thus the
attack performance gets worse in a thicker table given a certain
attack power. For example, when the MDF/glass thickness
increases from 3 mm to 2 cm, the wave amplitude will be
reduced by 14 dB. We perform experiments to evaluate the
impact of table thickness in Section VI-F below.
