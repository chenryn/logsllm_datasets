drops from 1442 to 579 bits, a reduction of around 60%.
Note that, as mentioned in Section 1.2, the “basic” approach can
be optimized by verifying multiplications with QuickSilver [33] or
the amortized version of Mac’n’Cheese [4]. This would bring the
basic costs closer to our optimized protocols, with the downside of
making non-black-box use of information-theoretic MACs, with
QuickSilver, or more rounds of interaction and computation, with
Mac’n’Cheese. There are two variants of QuickSilver which prove
satisfiability of circuits (“QS-Circuit”) or of sets of polynomials (“QS-
Poly”) respectively. Since bitADDcarry can be either represented
as a Boolean circuit or as a set of polynomials over F2, we can use
both variants in our conversion protocol.
These results highlight the advantage of our approach com-
pared to using only daBits. We also see that using QuickSilver
or Mac’n’Cheese to check multiplications (as also done in the con-
current work Mystique [32]) reduces communication by 1.5–3x.
This is because verifying a circuit with these protocols is cheaper
than evaluating a circuit in our approach (even using faulty triples).
6.2 Experiments
We have implemented the conversion protocol ΠConv using the
faulty-dabit approach of Section 3.4 in the Rust programming lan-
guage using the Swanky library1. The VOLE protocol over the 61-bit
field F𝑝 with 𝑝 = 261 − 1 is instantiated using [31]. All benchmarks
were run on a MacBook Pro 2018, 2.9 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i9,
32 GB 2400 MHz DDR4, with one thread per party. All experiments

are run in a Docker container running Ubuntu and using tc to arti-
ficially limit the network bandwidth, and simulating 1 ms latency.
Our implementation is currently capable of verifying conversions
for 𝑚 ≤ 60. We therefore run our conversion protocol on bit lengths
𝑚 ∈ {8, 16, 32, 60}. All benchmarks are run ensuring statistical
security of 240, by varying the sizes of 𝐵 and 𝐶 according to table
6 (see Appendix F). Lastly, all of these listed benchmarks are run
using Wolverine [31] to verify multiplications as in protocol ΠConv
of Section 3.2. We also implemented the variant of our protocol
using QuickSilver [33], which reduces the runtimes by around a
factor of two, thanks to the lower communication and preprocessing
requirements. In Appendix F we list all results when running with
either our optimized protocol, or the variant using [33].
Table 3 shows the communication required between the prover
and verifier when verifying 220 conversion tuples, when varying
the bit lengths.In this table we use Init to define the construction
of the channels used by the two parties as well as the initial setup
of the Wolverine VOLE protocol and the initial commitments to
the provers input. The row Conv covers the time it takes for the
prover and verifier to run ΠConv on the input provided by the
prover. This covers generation of the required edaBits, daBits
and multiplication triples. Here, even for the smallest setting of
𝑚 = 8 it can already be seen that the conversion costs dominates
both the VOLE setup and the Init phase. In Table 4 we list the time
for the same setup except the bit length is fixed at 𝑚 = 32. It can
be seen that increasing the network bandwidth beyond 100 Mbit/s
does not improve the protocol runtime by much. Therefore, for our
current implementation, computation is the limiting factor.
