### Bug summary
When figure.autolayout is set to True the output in the EPS file becomes
blank. The file is produced and no errors are mentioned.
### Code for reproduction
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.rc('text', usetex=True)
    plt.rcParams["figure.figsize"] = [3.4, 2.47]
    plt.rcParams['figure.autolayout'] = True
    [Ignoring creation of data for plots]
    plt.plot(t,d,label='electron bunch energy density')
    plt.savefig('test.eps')
### Actual outcome
EPS file converted to PDF
test.pdf
### Expected outcome
EPS file converted to PDF with `plt.rcParams['figure.autolayout'] = False` and
all else the same
test_false.pdf
### Additional information
The bug appears when I change to autolayout = True. I noticed there was an
earlier bug fix for a very similar scenario (#16898) which seems to fix for
the case where figure.autolayout = False.
