I'm using 6to5 on a big app. I like that you guys use regenerator to implement
generators, so I'm confused why you care that things get renamed. I have a lot
of generator functions, and if I minimize, I see the error "GeneratorFunction
renamed?"

If there isn't a solution to this, this may be a showstopper for me using
6to5. Surely you guys support minification?
