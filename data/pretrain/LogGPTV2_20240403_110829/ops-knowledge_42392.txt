User: How to implement code version control and collaborative development based on Git? Please explain the process in detail.
Assistant: Git is a distributed version control system that can be used for team collaborative development and version management of code. The following is the Git-based code version control and collaborative development process: 1. Create a Git warehouse: first create a Git warehouse locally or remotely, you can use the Git command line or Git client tool. 2. Create a development branch: Create a development branch in the Git repository. Developers write and modify code on the development branch, and maintain a stable version on the main branch. 3. Submit code: After the developer completes the code locally, submit the code to the local Git repository. You can use the Git add command to add modified files, and then use the Git commit command to submit the code. When submitting, you need to add comments to explain the modified content. 4. Push the local branch to the remote branch: After the development is completed, push the modification of the local branch to the remote branch, so that other developers can also see and operate the same code. Code can be pushed to a remote branch using the Git push command. 5. Merge branches: When multiple people collaborate on development, there may be different development branches, and it is necessary to merge these branches. You can use the Git merge command to merge branches and merge code submitted by other developers into your own branch. 6. Resolving conflicts: During the branch merging process, code conflicts may occur and conflicts need to be resolved. You can use the Git diff command to view the differences of conflicting files, manually modify the code and submit the modification again. 7. Submit an application: After completing the development, you can submit an application for code review, and then merge it into the main branch after passing the review. You can use the Git pull request command to submit an application and upload the code submission that needs to be reviewed. 8. Roll back the version: When there is a problem with the code or you need to roll back to the previous version, you can use the Git reset command to roll back the version and restore the previous version. The above is the version control and collaborative development process of the code based on Git, which requires continuous teamwork, problem solving, and timely code synchronization to ensure code stability and reliability.
