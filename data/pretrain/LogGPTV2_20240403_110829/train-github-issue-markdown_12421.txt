Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of your text:

---

```python
import scipy.special

# Example usage of the Hankel function of the first kind (order 0)
print(scipy.special.hankel1(0, 10**8))  # Output: (3.2060295340412074e-05+7.3063911655217044e-05j)
print(scipy.special.hankel1(0, 10**9))  # Output: (2.4687471886269185e-05-5.2104226538976152e-06j)
print(scipy.special.hankel1(0, 10**10)) # Output: (nan+nan*j)
```

I am not certain, but it seems that this computation might be better handled by either Mathematica or MATLAB. When using `scipy`, I encountered `nan` (not a number) for large input values.
