User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Is it safe to remove the BIN files that are generated by MySQL? They are taking up too much space:

/var/lib/mysql/jiaoyou-slow.log: 53M
/var/lib/mysql/mysql-bin.000005: 68M
/var/lib/mysql/mysql-bin.000003: 1.1G
/var/lib/mysql/mysql-bin.000007: 34M
/var/lib/mysql/mysql-bin.000004: 225M

Assistant: No, you should not delete them by hand.
If you delete them at the disk level, mysql will crash.
The command to remove them is:
PURGE BINARY LOGS TO 'mysql-bin.010';

Replace mysql-bin.010 with the last mysql-bin file that you wish to keep - typically the last one.
See the MySQL docs for more information.
