User: I have an issue with debugging and Cloud Endpoints. I'm using tons of endpoints in my application, and one endpoint consistently returns with error code 500, message "Internal Error".
This endpoint does not appear in my app's logs, and when I run its code directly in the interactive console (in production), everything works fine.
There might be a bug in my code that I am failing to see, however, the real problem here is that the failing endpoints request is NOT showing up in my app's logs â€“ which leaves me with no great way to debug the problem.
Any tips? Is it possible to force some kind of "debug" mode where more information (such as a stack trace) is conveyed back to me in the 500 response from endpoints? Why isn't the failing request showing up in my app's logs?
