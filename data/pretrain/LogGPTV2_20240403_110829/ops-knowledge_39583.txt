User: I'm trying to setup volatility so I can execute commands regardless of what directory I happen to be in at the time.  I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, I've set the environmental variables with the export command.  I've double checked my my ~/.bashrc and even added the directory to /etc/enviroment.  Running echo $PATH=vol.py returns /mydir/volatility/vol.py.  But when I run python vol.py I get "python: can't open file 'vol.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory" . 
So I guess my question.  How can I set evironmental variables for python so that when I run python vol.py it executes on whatever image file I point it to without being in the volatility directory? Or even better just type vol.py -f whatever/imagefile, the system recognizes it as a python script and executes.  
I figure its probably something simple, but I'm still learning, so any help is much appreciated.  
My system :  Kubuntu 14.04LTS; 
Python 2.7; 
Volatility 2.4
Assistant: It looks like you added the vol.py to your PATH, which is incorrect. You need to only add the directory to it such as /mydir/volatility/ without the vol.py in it
