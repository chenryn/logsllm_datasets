User: I made a program that both gathers data from a .txt file by reading it, and writes data to a different .txt file. However, there is a problem. When I run the program in a normal directory It runs perfectly fine. A problem arises when I place it in the C:\Program Files directory. When I run it I get IOERROR: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'my subdirectory'. I believe this is probably due to this directory having some extra protocols when it comes to editing files within it. 
This is in Windows 7, if it wasn't already apparent. 
Also if it makes a difference the program was written in Python then converted to an .exe with py2exe.
Assistant: You need to execute this program as administrator or an account you have granted permissions to if you want to write to the program files folder. If you run the executable as normal user you won't have access.
