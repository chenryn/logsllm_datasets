4 System Catalog Tables
The following system catalog tables contain definitions of database objects. The layout
of the system tables is subject to change; if you are writing an application that depends on
information stored in the system tables, it would be prudent to use an existing catalog
view, or create a catalog view to isolate the application from changes to the system table.
4.1 dual
dual is a single-row, single-column table that is provided for compatibility with Oracle
databases only.
Column Type Modifiers Description
dummy VARCHAR2(1) Provided for compatibility only.
4.2 edb_dir
The edb_dir table contains one row for each alias that points to a directory created with
the CREATE DIRECTORY command. A directory is an alias for a pathname that allows a
user limited access to the host file system.
You can use a directory to fence a user into a specific directory tree within the file
system. For example, the UTL_FILE package offers functions that permit a user to read
and write files and directories in the host file system, but only allows access to paths that
the database administrator has granted access to via a CREATE DIRECTORY command.
Column Type Modifiers Description
dirname "name" not null The name of the alias.
dirowner oid not null The OID of the user that owns the alias.
dirpath text The directory name to which access is granted.
diracl aclitem[] The access control list that determines which users
may access the alias.
4.3 edb_password_history
The edb_password_history table contains one row for each password change. The
table is shared across all databases within a cluster.
Column Type References Description
passhistroleid oid pg_authid.oid The ID of a role.
passhistpassword text Role password in md5 encrypted form.
passhistpasswordsetat timestamptz The time the password was set.
