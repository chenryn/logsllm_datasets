Question: A web application uses MongoDB as its NoSQL database and exposes a JSON API for data retrieval. A penetration tester is evaluating the application for potential security vulnerabilities. Given that NoSQL databases like MongoDB can be prone to injection attacks due to their custom API calls and looser consistency restrictions, which of the following areas should the tester MOST likely focus on to detect NoSQL injection vulnerabilities?
"A": "The areas where the application's API calls are parsed and evaluated for JSON syntax correctness.",
"B": "The areas where the application sanitizes user inputs to filter out HTML special characters such as < > & ;",
"C": "The areas where the application's front-end JavaScript code interacts with CSS properties.",
"D": "The areas where the NoSQL database performs concurrency checks and transactional operations."
Answer: A
