Checkbook Shutter Control
"I could certainly foresee circumstances in which 
we would not want imagery to be openly 
disseminated of a sensitive site of any type, 
whether it is here or overseas," 
- Robert Muttett, director National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency
“With the help of about $1 billion from Murrett's
agency, the companies [DigitalGlobe GeoEye] 
plan to launch new satellites with higher 
resolutions later this year.”
“While the public will begin to see crisper images 
online and elsewhere, government regulations 
will require the companies to degrade the quality 
of the imagery to a half-meter resolution.”

Imagery Analysis
• Understand capabilities and limitations of 
sensors and platforms
• Image quality and realistic expectations
• Build smart books
• Combine multiple sources and times
• Seek out domain experts
– Collaborative analysis
• Combine with other forms of information
• Reverse engineering a city
• Watching the watcher
• A look to the future
Keplerian Elements
• Epoch
• Orbital Inclination
• Right Ascension of Ascending Node
• Argument of Perigee
• Eccentricity
• Mean Motion
• Mean Anomaly
• Drag (optional)
