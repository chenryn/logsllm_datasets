## Expected Behavior
Can override `MuiTouchRipple` in the `ThemeOptions` overrides section.
## Current Behavior
Get a typescript error that MuiTouchRipple is not defined in Overrides
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
    const customMuiTheme = createMuiTheme({
    	overrides: {
    		MuiTouchRipple: {
    			root: {
    				display: 'none'
    			}
    		}
    	}
    });
## Context
Unable to override the mui touch ripple. Is there a different way to override
this setting that makes Typescript happy?
