I'm having a play around with replacing selenium in my automated tests with
playwright and i can't seem to get drag and drop to work using the 'move',
'down', and 'up methods on page.mouse. the app i'm testing uses
DragEvent.dataTransfer so i imagine this is why i'm not having any luck. is
there a reccomended way to simulate drag and drop events using the current
api, or better yet, would it be possible to introduce an api for simulating
drag and drop events?
p.s. i would prefer not to use page.eval to trigger events using javascript if
possible.
cheers.
