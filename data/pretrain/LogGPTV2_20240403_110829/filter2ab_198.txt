# Finding Ducky - Part 1
**Category:** OSINT, 50 points

## Description
Ducky has gone missing! A few days ago, he tweeted that he was onto something significant. Yesterday, he posted a cryptic message, and all attempts to contact him since then have failed. We suspect that he may have been kidnapped. We believe that before his disappearance, Ducky might have reached out to his sister. The last thing she posted was the following image. Your task is to determine her location.

**Note:** The flag format is `cstechnion{}`.
