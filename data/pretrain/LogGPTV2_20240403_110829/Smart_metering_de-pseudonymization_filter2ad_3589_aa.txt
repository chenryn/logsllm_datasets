ABSTRACT
Consumption traces collected by Smart Meters are highly
privacy sensitive data. For this reason, current best prac-
tice is to store and process such data in pseudonymized
form, separating identity information from the consump-
tion traces. However, even the consumption traces alone
may provide many valuable clues to an attacker, if com-
bined with limited external indicators. Based on this obser-
vation, we identify two attack vectors using anomaly detec-
tion and behavior pattern matching that allow eﬀective de-
pseudonymization. Using a practical evaluation with real-
life consumption traces of 53 households, we verify the feasi-
bility of our techniques and show that the attacks are robust
against common countermeasures, such as resolution reduc-
tion or frequent re-pseudonymization.

INTRODUCTION
The deployment of Smart Metering—the digital recording
and processing of electricity consumption—is ever increas-
ing. A Smart Meter is an electrical meter that records a
ﬁne-grained consumption trace of a household and sends it
to the respective electricity supplier. These consumption
traces, in contrast to traditional single annual consumption
values, allow the realization of time-of-use tariﬀs and de-
mand response schemes.
This ﬂexibility, however, comes at a price. Every activity
that takes place in the household and makes use of elec-
trical appliances is reﬂected in the consumption trace.
In
consequence, Smart Metering has repeatedly been called a
privacy invasion into households [7, 8] and a large body of
previous work [5, 6, 11, 12, 14, 15, 20] has been concerned
with inferring private information from energy consumption
traces.
Based on the identiﬁed privacy implications, there is con-
sensus that consumption data of Smart Metering needs to
be adequately protected. Such protection entails the pro-
tection during storage by the supplier and during the use of
the data by the supplier and 3rd party contractors. Pseudo-

nymization of consumption traces is considered an eﬀective
defense against privacy attacks, as it allows for unlinking the
identity of the household and its consumption trace. The
consumer’s identity can be stored independently from con-
sumption traces, only linked by the pseudonym.
In such
a scenario, the privacy-invading methods developed in pre-
vious work can only be applied by the owner of both, the
identity database and the consumption traces.
An attacker faces two problems, if he has only access to
pseudonymized traces: First, deduction from pseudonymous
consumption traces is error-prone as no identity information
can be used as contextual data. Second and more impor-
tant, all information inferred from consumption traces can
not be attributed to a speciﬁc household due to the unlink-
ability introduced by pseudonymization. This makes con-
sumption traces and its contained information unattractive
for targeted abuse and apparently the consumers’ privacy is
protected.
In this paper, we develop two attack vectors targeting
the privacy of pseudonymized consumption traces. The ﬁrst
attack allows to create a link between a household’s iden-
tity and its consumption trace, and therefore enables an at-
tacker to undo pseudonymization. If successful, this attack
allows all existing deduction attacks to be applied again.
The second method enables an attacker to track the origin
of a consumption trace across re-pseudonymization or across
different databases. For conducting these attacks in prac-
tice, we provide a data analysis framework that allows an
attacker to apply either method to consumption databases.
The paper’s main contributions are as follows:
1. An abstract deﬁnition of attack vectors on the unlink-
ability of pseudonymous Smart Metering consumption
traces.
2. A machine learning framework for the analysis of con-
sumption traces and subsequent execution of afore-
mentioned attack vectors.
3. Experimental ﬁndings about the anomaly detection in
consumption traces and the tracking of consumption
traces across pseudonyms.
4. An evaluation of diﬀerent mitigation techniques with
respect to their eﬀectiveness against those attacks.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows: In Sec-
tion 2 we provide an overview of the terminology used in this
paper. Section 3 describes the two attack vectors that we
identiﬁed for de-pseudonymization. In Section 4, we present
a data analysis framework for conducting these attacks in
practice. Section 5 shows our experimental results regard-
ing the applicability of our attacks. Approaches for limiting
linkability like reduced resolution, frequent re-pseudonymi-
zation and cryptography solutions are discussed in Section
6. Finally, in Section 7 we discuss related work before we
conclude in Section 8.
2. TERMINOLOGY AND ASSUMPTIONS
This paper’s understanding of identity, pseudonymity and
other privacy related terms is based on terminology deﬁni-
tions provided by Pﬁtzmann and Hansen [19].
In the following we will use the term consumption trace for
a recording of electric consumption in discrete time slots of
equal length. The resolution of a consumption trace is the
number of time slots per day. The term consumer stands
for the household that makes use of the utility that is mea-
sured by a Smart Meter. The subject supplier stands ex-
emplary for any subject (actual supplier or grid operator)
that participates in Smart Metering and has legitimate in-
terest in consumption traces, e.g. for billing electricity con-
sumption. The Smart Meter records the consumption con-
stantly and communicates it to the supplier. The Smart
Meter, respectively the consumption trace, are attributed
with a pseudonym for the consumer. This pseudonym is
pre-arranged by the supplier and non-public.
The supplier stores consumption traces by pseudonym in
a consumption trace database. The supplier accesses this
database for billing or analysis in general. Contractors of
the supplier also have access to this database but not to
the identity database. Contractors provide analysis services
to suppliers based on pseudonymized consumption traces.
For the purpose of invoice creation the supplier owns an-
other database, the identity database, that connects the con-
sumer’s identity with the pseudonym.
Optionally, a supplier may re-pseudonymize a consump-
tion trace repeatedly, creating a 1 to n relationship between
identities and pseudonyms. Consumers can switch suppliers
which leads to the following situation: They have an old con-
sumption trace, identity information and linking pseudonym
in the old supplier’s databases and also a current consump-
tion trace and new pseudonym together with their identity
information in their new supplier’s databases. Contractors
and suppliers may behave semi-honest, i.e, they stick to the
protocols and respective laws but try to learn as much about
consumers as possible. Our attacker model includes contrac-
tors, suppliers but also external malicious agents that might
illegally obtain consumption traces.
3. ATTACK DESCRIPTION
The ﬁnal goal of our attacker model is to create a link be-
tween the identity of consumers and their energy consump-
tion. To this end, we present two diﬀerent attacks that can
be applied to achieve this goal. We name the attacks: linking
by behavior anomaly and linking by behavior pattern.
Once a link between a consumption trace and a speciﬁc
household has been established all information contained in
the trace can be attributed to this household.
If, on the
other hand, a consumption trace cannot be linked to one
household with a signiﬁcant higher probability than to an-
other household, this means that the data and its contained
information cannot be attributed to a single household. In
this case, the contained information would not have a pri-
vacy impact on its origin. Thus, linkability is a suﬃcient
condition for privacy loss in Smart Metering.
3.1 Linking by Behaviour Anomaly
Linking by behavior anomaly (LA) can be used by the
attacker to link either an identity to a consumption trace
or two consumption traces with each other (see Figures 1
and 2). This is accomplished by identifying and correlating
anomalies in both data sources that occur at the same time.
We characterize an anomaly as a series of unusual events,
where an event is some consumer behavior that is reﬂected
in the energy consumption of the respective household. The
rarity of an anomaly is based on diﬀerent factors: Length of
the series, the resolution of the time stamp (day, hours or
minutes) and rarity of the singular events among the pop-
ulation of consumption traces under consideration. Length
and resolution make up for singular events that happen very
often among the population: Leaving home or coming home
at slightly diﬀerent times during the course of one week. On
the other hand, there are events that neither require a series
nor a high resolution: moving in/out, death/birth or holi-
days. A series of events for a low resolution can be observed
if household inhabitants leave every weekend or stay at home
always at speciﬁc work days. Here the rarity originates from
the length of the series.
With respect to linking a consumption trace to an identity,
LA can be used in both ways. Either identifying the house-
hold for a consumption trace or vice versa. It really depends
on the ﬁnal purpose of the identiﬁcation which approach is
taken, whether speciﬁc households should be targeted (like
both examples in Section 3.3) or speciﬁc consumption pro-
ﬁles are of interest. The main requirement for this attack is
to have two data sources that overlap for the time interval
where an anomaly has been identiﬁed.

3.2 Linking by Behavior Pattern
The goal of linking by behavior pattern (LP) is to link
diﬀerent pseudonyms of one consumer (see Figure 3). There
are two reasons for one consumer to have diﬀerent pseudo-
nyms attached to his identity: Either one supplier re-pseudo-
nymizes his consumption trace database or the consumer
has consumption traces in different databases with diﬀerent
pseudonyms respectively. The latter happens when a con-
sumer changes his supplier. The old supplier still possess
the consumption trace with one pseudonym and the new
supplier starts to collect a consumption trace under a new
pseudonym. This is equivalent to tracking consumers across
diﬀerent databases.
The former case, re-pseudonymization, means that a con-
sumer’s traces are stored under the pseudonym A in time
interval t and stored under pseudonym B in time interval
t + 1 in the same database. This method could be applied
by suppliers to prevent the de-pseudonymization of many
years of consumption proﬁles under the same pseudonym in
case one pseudonym is de-pseudonymized.
For this attack the attacker requires a database of pseu-
donymized consumption traces containing the pseudonym
A. He tries to ﬁnd a consumption trace with pseudonym
B that has been created by the same consumer. Then the
attacker can link the pseudonym A with pseudonym B.
In contrast to the LA attack, this attack can be applied
even if the data sources do not overlap in time. This is
because fundamental patterns in consumption are identiﬁed
and subsequently looked for in the other data source. This
means, that we can either consider consumption slices from
two diﬀerent consumption trace databases or two consump-
tion traces from the same database but from diﬀerent time
intervals.
The feasibility of such an attack would also imply that
everyone possessing current consumption traces and links
to consumer identities can harvest all consumption traces
that have been published (even in anonymized form) in the
past or can be obtained for the past. On the other hand,
legitimate holders of old consumption trace databases and
Figure 3: Identifying consumption traces with the
same origin
the corresponding identities are able to ”de-anonymize” data
traces that are publicized in the future.
3.3 Exempliﬁed Attacks
There is a multitude of attack scenarios that involve link-
ing Smart Meter data and contained information to their
origin household. We herein provide two examples:
Fake sick-day disclosure.
An employer could attempt to spy on his employees. In
particular, he would like to know whether employees really
spend their sick days at home. In order to do that, the em-
ployer obtains pseudonymized consumption traces for con-
sumers in the geographic region of his employees’ house-
holds. Using a correlation of vacation/company travel data
with the consumption trace he links his employees’ identities
to the respective pseudonymized consumption traces. Then
the employer can try to derive employee behavior on sick
days from the employee’s consumption trace.
Absence pattern deduction.
Another motivation for linking a household to its con-
sumption trace is preparing a burglary [17]. Once a burglar
has identiﬁed a worthwhile victim in the physical world, the
burglar would like execute his plans undisturbed by the in-
habitants. The burglar therefore performs an observation
of the household in question and their weekend behavior.
He simply ﬁnds out whether they stay at home or leave for
the weekend over the course of several weeks. By correlat-
ing this information with a consumption trace database this
household’s trace can be identiﬁed in the database. Now, re-
peating long-term absence patterns of this household can be
found, e.g. for a regular family meeting or a time share, and
subsequently the burglary can be scheduled for such a date.
Traditionally, a burglar would need to observe a household
for years to get these information. The linking of household
identity and its consumption trace, however, allows him to
tap into a wealth of information about a long time-frame of
the household in question.
4. DATA ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK
So far we have studied the linking of consumption traces
and consumer identities in an abstract manner. For conduct-
ing the presented attacks in practice, we now introduce a
data analysis framework. This framework builds on concepts
of machine learning and allows us to analyze consumption
traces geometrically. To this end, the consumption trace of
a consumer is mapped to a high-dimensional feature space,
such that it can be analyzed by standard techniques of ma-
chine learning.
In this geometric representation, the link-
ing by behavior anomaly can be achieved using geometric
anomaly detection, where unusual events are identiﬁed by
a large distance from normal activity. Similarly, the linking
by behavior pattern can be carried out using geometric clas-
siﬁcation, where the behavior of one consumer is separated
from all other users in the feature space. Figure 4 illustrates
this geometric interpretation of the two attacks.
consumption moves from one state to another. This discrete
behavior is illustrated in Figure 5, which shows the consump-
tion of one user over the period of one week on a ﬁxed grid.
Dark entries in the grid indicate frequent occurrences of a
consumption value.
It is notable that the consumption is
neither a continuous nor a smooth function and several dis-
crete states can be observed. For example, between 10:00
o’clock and 11:00 o’clock the consumption matches one of
