User: How to troubleshoot and analyze when the throughput of the server reaches the bottleneck?
Assistant: 1. Monitor system load: By monitoring system load, you can determine whether the system is exceeding its capacity. 2. Analyze log files: System logs or application logs may contain information such as system resource utilization. By analyzing these logs, you can find where the bottleneck of the system may be. 3. Analyze network traffic: If the website access is slow, you should check whether the network traffic is saturated. There may be a network bottleneck, which is not necessarily on the server itself. 4. Check server resources: Check the real-time utilization of resources such as CPU, memory, hard disk, and network adapter of the server to determine which resource becomes the bottleneck. 5. Check the database: When the system needs to access a large number of databases or server sessions increase, you can check whether the database becomes a bottleneck, and improve the throughput of the system by optimizing database access. 6. Analyze the code or application: Use code scanning tools and code analyzers to find performance bottlenecks or programming errors in the code. In addition, you can use the performance debugging tools of the application to troubleshoot problems. 7. Horizontal expansion or vertical expansion: When the system has a bottleneck, you can consider horizontal expansion (increasing the number of servers) or vertical expansion (increasing server resources).
