User: i'm writing a python application that uses a command line utility (propietary so it can't be modified) to do part of its work. The problem is that I have to pass the password as a command line argument to the tool which would easily be seen by any user doing 'ps ax'. How can I send the password to the command line tool safely from within python (or a shell script)?
Assistant: You may be able to gain more security by having an encrypted password argument and passing an encrypted password, and the program can de-crypt it. At least there would be no plain-text password floating around. I used this method when launching a process via another process and passing it arguments. It may not be feasible in your case though.
