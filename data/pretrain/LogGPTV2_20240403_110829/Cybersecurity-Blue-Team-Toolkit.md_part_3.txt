[]{#f08.xhtml#flast01-sec-0001}
The year was 2012 and I took a big leap in my own career to move across
the country. I filled a role to lead a three‐person team providing
information technology and security training to Department of Defense
personnel. This leadership role was new to me having worked for the past
eight years in the intelligence and information security world for the
most part as a trainer. While building out the team in the fall of 2012,
I interviewed a wonderful candidate from Louisiana named Nadean Tanner.
She was full of personality, charisma, knowledge, and most importantly,
she had the ability to train. She proved this as part of her training
demonstration in the interview process. I knew she was the right
candidate and hired her almost immediately. Hiring Nadean is still one
of the best decisions I made, and she is one of the greatest trainers I
know. My philosophy is that a great trainer does not simply regurgitate
what they know. Rather, they have the ability to explain a topic in
different ways so that each learner can comprehend. Nadean embodies this
philosophy.
Nadean has trained thousands of learners on topics from hardware to
advanced security. In each class, she takes the time and effort to
ensure every learner gets what they need. Whether learning a product for
performing their job, building out their professional development, or
advancing their career with a certification, Nadean covers it all. If
you had the opportunity to attend one of her training classes, consider
yourself blessed by a great trainer. If you have not, you picked up this
book, which is the next best thing. I am glad to see her move to
authorship, allowing everyone to experience her ability to explain
complicated topics in simple ways.
In the world of cybersecurity we are constantly bombarded with new
products, new tools, and new attack techniques. We are pulled daily in
multiple directions on what to secure and how to secure it. In this
book, Nadean will []{#f08.xhtml#Page_xxii .pagebreak title="xxii"
role="doc-pagebreak"}break down fundamental tools available to you. This
includes general IT tools used for troubleshooting, but ones that can
also help the security team understand the environment. She will cover
tools attackers use, but also empower you and your team to use them to
be proactive in your security. Specifically, you as the reader get to
enjoy not only Nadean\'s ability to impart knowledge but her uncanny
ability to explain why. Rather than being technical documentation
focusing on the how, Nadean will delve into why use the tools and the
specific use cases. For many users fresh to the cybersecurity world,
this should be considered a getting started guide. For those in the
middle of or more senior in their careers, this book will serve as a
reference guide you want to have on your desk. It is not a book that
makes it to your shelf and collects dust.
Throughout the years I have been Nadean\'s manager, colleague, peer, and
most importantly dear friend. We have shared stories about how we
learned, what we learned, and how we passed the information along to our
learners. As the owner of this book, you are well on your way to
enjoying Nadean\'s simple yet thorough explanations of advanced security
topics. Rather than spending more of your time on reading this foreword,
jump into the book to learn, refresh, or hone your cybersecurity skills.

If you have ever been a fisherman or been friends with or related to a
fisherman, you know one of their favorite things is their tackle box ...
and telling stories. If you ask a question about anything in that tackle
box, be prepared to be entertained while you listen to stories of past
fishing expeditions, how big was the one that got away, the one that did
get caught, and future plans to use certain hooks, feathers, and wiggly
things. A great fisherman learns to adapt to the situation they are in,
and it takes special knowledge of all the fun things in that tackle
box---when and where and how to use them---to be successful in their
endeavor.
In cybersecurity, we have our own form of a tackle box. We have our own
versions of wiggly things. To be successful, we have to learn when and
where and how to use our tools and adapt to the technical situation we
find ourselves in. It can take time to develop the expertise to know
when to use which tool, and what product to find vulnerabilities, fix
them, and, when necessary, catch the bad guys.
There are so many philosophies, frameworks, compliances, and vendors.
How do you know when to use which wiggly thing? Once you know which
wiggly thing to use, how do you use it? This book will teach you how to
apply best‐practice cybersecurity strategies and scenarios in a
multitude of situations []{#f09.xhtml#Page_xxiv .pagebreak title="xxiv"
role="doc-pagebreak"}and which open source tools are most beneficial to
protect our dynamic and multifaceted environments.
This book will take a simple and strategic look at best practices and
readily available tools that are accessible to both cybersecurity
management and hands‐on professionals---whether they be new to the
industry or simply are looking to gain expertise.

Before heading off to the cybersecurity conference Black Hat in Las
Vegas, a friend of mine, Douglas Brush, posted on his LinkedIn page a
warning for other InfoSec professionals. He said, "Don\'t go to these
events to buy curtains for the house when you don\'t have the concrete
for the foundation poured yet."
Too many times in the many years I\'ve been in information technology
(IT), I have seen people forget they need the basics in place before
they try to use their shiny new tools. Before you can use any new tools,
you must have a foundation to build upon. In IT, these tools are
fundamental. They are a must for any computer/InfoSec/analyst to know
how to use and when to use them. It\'s also rather impressive when a
manager who you assumed was nontechnical asks you to ping that asset,
run a tracert, and discover the physical and logical addresses of the
web server that is down. Sometimes they *do* speak your language!
