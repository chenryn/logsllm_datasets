**ATT&CK ID:** S0570  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** BitPaymer

**Description:**
BitPaymer achieves persistence by setting a run key in the Windows Registry. Specifically, it modifies the following registry key:

```
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
```

This ensures that the malware is executed every time the user logs in, thereby maintaining persistence on the system.
