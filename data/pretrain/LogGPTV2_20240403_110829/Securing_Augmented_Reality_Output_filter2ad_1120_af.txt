The computer security research community has recently
identiﬁed the need to address security and privacy for emerging
AR systems (e.g., [8, 39]). Arya leverages recent work in this
area, particularly work on limiting AR application access to
potentially sensitive sensor data (e.g., [18, 19, 36, 40, 45]).
Also related, SurroundWeb [51] allows applications to project
onto surfaces in a room, but considers primarily privacy
concerns (not sharing video information about the room) rather
than output security. PrePose [11] supports deﬁning new input
gestures (e.g., hand motions) while mitigating privacy and
security threats from sensing applications.
To date, most work on AR security and privacy has focused
on input-related issues. By contrast, Arya focuses on output.
It builds on prior work that identiﬁed the need to securely
handle AR output and leverages the AR object model from that
work [21], but dives much deeper, uncovering and addressing
additional fundamental challenges.
MacIntyre et al. [24] proposed an earlier version of AR
objects, but without a focus on security. Greenberg et al. [14]

computing more generally; several of these patterns (e.g.,
“captive audience”) are related to the AR output threats we
consider. Ng-Thow-Hing et al. [34] discuss design guidelines
for automotive AR applications, some of which (e.g., limiting
distraction) can be enforced by Arya’s policies.
Researchers have previously considered the challenge of
constraining and securing application output in more tradi-
tional platforms (e.g., [10, 38, 43]). While AR platforms can
build on lessons from these prior platforms, the existence of
virtual 3D objects that can overlay on the user’s view of the
real world raises new challenges.
IX. CONCLUSION
Immersive augmented reality technologies, such as head-
mounted displays like Microsoft’s HoloLens or automotive
windshields, are becoming a commercial reality. Though the
computer security research community has begun to address
input-related risks with emerging AR platforms, little has been
done to address output risks. Our work considers these risks —
for example, buggy or malicious applications that create virtual
content that obscures the user’s view of the real world (or
the virtual content from other applications) in undesirable or
unsafe ways.
To address these risks, we design, implement, and evaluate
Arya, an AR platform that supports multiple applications si-
multaneously augmenting the user’s view of the world. Arya’s
primary contribution is the design of an output policy module
that constrains AR application output according to policies
(e.g., preventing virtual content from obscuring a real-world
person). We identify and overcome numerous challenges in
designing an AR output policy speciﬁcation and evaluation
framework that supports composable, effective, and efﬁcient
policies. We evaluate our prototype implementation of Arya
with prototype policies drawn from various sources. We ﬁnd
that Arya prevents undesirable behavior in case study applica-
tions, and that the performance overhead of policy enforcement
is acceptable even in our unoptimized prototype.
Now is the time to consider the security and privacy risks
raised by emerging AR technologies. Modifying the user’s
view of the world is a key feature of AR applications, and left
unconstrained, this ability can raise serious risks. We argue
that future AR platforms must consider and address these
issues if they are to safely and securely support multiple,
simultaneously running applications as well as continuous use
of immersive AR as the user moves about the physical world.
The design challenges we raise in this paper, and the solutions
we propose through Arya, represent a promising step towards
secure AR output.
