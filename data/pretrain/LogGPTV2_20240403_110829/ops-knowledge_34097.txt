I hope this doesn't cross into superuser territory.

I have an embedded Linux system where the system processes are quite minimal. I'm not entirely sure which system process monitors the physical layer and starts a DHCP client when a network cable is plugged in, so I created my own.

The issue I'm facing is that if I run a Python script that uses HTTP connections before the system has an IP address, the script will never establish a connection. Even after obtaining a valid IP address, the Python script still encounters a "Temporary failure in name resolution" error.

How can I make the Python script recognize the new network connection without restarting it? Alternatively, am I missing some standard procedure that Linux typically runs when a network cable is connected?

I am using `udhcpc` as the DHCP client and Python 2.6 with the `httplib` library for making HTTP connections.

After further research, it seems the problem might be related to glibc, as suggested by jedwards. I did not find a direct solution, but I implemented a workaround for my specific use case.

Since I only need to access one URL, I created a custom "resolv.conf" file. A small daemon retrieves the IP address of the URL when the PHY layer reports that the cable is connected. This IP address is then saved to my custom "resolv.conf" file. The Python script reads this IP address and uses it for its HTTP POST requests.

While this is not an ideal solution, it works for my needs.
