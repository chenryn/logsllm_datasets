User: I hope this doesn't cross into superuser territory.
So I have an embedded linux, where system processes are naturally quite stripped. I'm not quite sure which system process monitors to physical layer and starts a dhcp client when network cable is plugged in, but i made one myself.

The problem is, that if i have a python script, using http connections, running before i have an IP address, it will never get a connection. Even after i have a valid IP, the python still has 
"Temporary error in name resolution"
So how can I get the python to realize the new connection available, without restarting the script? 
Alternatively , am I missing some normal procedure Linux runs normally at network cable connect.
The dhcp client I am using is udhcpc and python version is 2.6. Using httplib for connections.
Assistant: After alot more research, the glibc problem jedwards suggested, seemed to be the problem. I did not find a solution, but made workaround for my usecase. 
Considering I only use one URL, I added my own "resolv.file" . 
A small daemon gets the IP address of the URL when PHY reports cable connected. This IP is saved to "my own resolv.conf". From this file the python script retrieves the IP to use for posts.
Not really a good solution, but a solution.
