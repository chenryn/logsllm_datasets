User: How to use Python's socket library to write network client and server applications to achieve data interaction and information transmission?
Assistant: In Python, it is convenient to write network client and server applications using the socket library. The socket library provides different types of sockets, including stream sockets and datagram sockets, which can be used for communication of TCP and UDP protocols. The following is a simple example showing how to write a simple TCP client and server using the socket library: Server-side code: ```python import socket # Create a TCP socket server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket .SOCK_STREAM) # Bind IP address and port number server_socket.bind(('127.0.0.1', 8000)) # Listen for connections server_socket.listen(5) print('The server is started, listening for connections...') while True: # Waiting for the client to connect to client_socket, client_address = server_socket.accept() print('The client is connected:', client_address) #Send data to the client client_socket.send('Welcome to the server'.encode()) # Receive the data sent by the client data = client_socket.recv(1024) print('Received data:', data.decode()) # Close the connection client_socket.close() ``` Client code: ```python import socket # Create TCP socket client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) #Connect to server client_socket.connect(('127.0.0.1', 8000)) # Receive data sent by server data = client_socket.recv(1024 ) print('Received data:', data.decode()) # Send data to the server client_socket.send('Hello, Server!'.encode()) # Close the connection client_socket.close() ``` First, the server The client creates a TCP socket and binds the IP address and port number. The server then listens for connections and waits for clients to connect. Once a client is connected, the server sends a welcome message to the client, then receives the data sent by the client, and finally closes the connection. The client creates a TCP socket and connects to the server. Once the connection is established, the client receives the welcome message from the server, then sends data to the server, and finally closes the connection. This is a simple example showing how to write a simple TCP client and server using Python's socket library. In practical applications, the code can be modified as needed to achieve different data interaction and information transmission.
