Some public functions defined in `numpy/core/records.py` and accessible via
the `np.rec` namespace have incomplete docstrings that do not fully comply
with the numpydoc standard.
For example:
numpy/numpy/core/records.py
Lines 596 to 609 in 43ca3a5
|  def fromarrays(arrayList, dtype=None, shape=None, formats=None,  
---|---  
|  names=None, titles=None, aligned=False, byteorder=None):  
|  """ create a record array from a (flat) list of arrays  
|  
|  >>> x1=np.array([1,2,3,4])  
|  >>> x2=np.array(['a','dd','xyz','12'])  
|  >>> x3=np.array([1.1,2,3,4])  
|  >>> r = np.core.records.fromarrays([x1,x2,x3],names='a,b,c')  
|  >>> print(r[1])  
|  (2, 'dd', 2.0) # may vary  
|  >>> x1[1]=34  
|  >>> r.a  
|  array([1, 2, 3, 4])  
|  """  
At the very least, this docstring is missing the `Parameters` and `Returns`
sections as well as the `Examples` header above the examples.
A listing of functions that this issue applies to in `numpy/core/records.py`
  * `fromarrays`
  * `fromrecords`
  * `fromstring`
  * `fromfile`
  * `array`
Additionally (perhaps a separate issue), there are two other functions which
are "public" (i.e. name does not start with an underscore) though from context
it appears that they may be intended only for internal use within the
`records` submodule. They also do not have proper docstrings:
  * `find_duplicate`
  * `get_remaining_size`
