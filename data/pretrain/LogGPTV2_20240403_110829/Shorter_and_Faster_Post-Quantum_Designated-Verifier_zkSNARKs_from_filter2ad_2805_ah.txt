GKR to verify general arithmetic circuits while retaining a linear-
time prover and sublinear verification (for structured circuits). The
proof size in their construction scales with the depth of the circuit.
Inner product arguments. Building on works by Bayer and Groth [12,
73], Bootle et al. [34] introduced zero-knowledge arguments for
arithmetic circuit satisfiability based on inner product arguments.
B√ºnz et al. [43] improved the construction to achieve shorter proofs
and verification times. While the proofs are short, the verification
time scales linearly with the circuit size and these constructions
rely on pre-quantum assumptions.
Lattice-based constructions. In the lattice-based setting, there
have been several instantiations in the designated-verifier model
based on linear PCPs [31, 32, 65]. Baum et al. [11] gave the first
publicly-verifiable argument from standard lattice assumptions
with ÀúùëÇ(‚àö
ùëÅ)-size proofs. Bootle et al. [37] reduced the proof size
further to polylog(ùëÅ). In both these cases, the verifier is not succinct
and runs in linear time.
