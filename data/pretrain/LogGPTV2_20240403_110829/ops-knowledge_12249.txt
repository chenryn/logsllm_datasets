User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Log in to terminal server directly Is it possible to allow particular domain users to log in to a terminal server directly if the server is part of a terminal server farm?

Environment: 3 x Windows Server 2008 R2

Assistant: With NLB, no, however administrators can target individual servers by using mstsc /admin.  If you have a hardware load balancer, regular users most likely can target individual servers (depends on how the VIP is setup).

That said, targeting individual servers is usually a flawed design. I would avoid this, as it usually means there is not proper redundancy for an app, or the load may not be properly distributed.
