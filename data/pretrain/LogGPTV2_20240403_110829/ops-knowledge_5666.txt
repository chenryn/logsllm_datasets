User: How to copy data from one table to another in MySQL database?
Assistant: Data can be copied from one table to another using the INSERT INTO SELECT statement. The syntax is as follows: INSERT INTO table2 (column1, column2, column3, ...) SELECT column1, column2, column3, ... FROM table1; Among them, table1 is the original table that needs to copy data, table2 is the target table that needs to copy data, column1, column2, column3, etc. are the column names that need to be copied. For example, to copy all the data in the employees table to the employees_copy table, you can use the following statement: INSERT INTO employees_copy (employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary) SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees;
