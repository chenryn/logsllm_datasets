## Feature request
webpack 5 currently makes `output.ecmaVersion` default to `6`. This can create
issues for projects needing to support older browsers like IE 11.  
Many projects (including Babel's preset-env) have moved in the direction of
relying on a shared browserslist config to avoid duplicating the browser
support info. It would be great if webpack could rely this info as well, to
select the `output.ecmaVersion` automatically by default
Initially suggested in the beta feedback at #9802 (comment)
**What is the expected behavior?**
**What is motivation or use case for adding/changing the behavior?**
Devs will get a working build by default without even having to know that the
`output.ecmaVersion` config setting exists. This goes in the direction of
0-config.
**How should this be implemented in your opinion?**
@vankop and @evilebottnawi have discussed some implementation suggestions in
comments following the one I linked above.
**Are you willing to work on this yourself?**  
I don't really have time right now, so no guarantee.
