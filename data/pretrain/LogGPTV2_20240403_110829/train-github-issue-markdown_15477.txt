## Feature Request

Currently, Webpack 5 sets the default value of `output.ecmaVersion` to `6`. This can cause compatibility issues for projects that need to support older browsers, such as Internet Explorer 11.

Many projects, including Babel's preset-env, have adopted a shared `browserslist` configuration to avoid duplicating browser support information. It would be beneficial if Webpack could also leverage this configuration to automatically determine the `output.ecmaVersion` by default.

This feature was initially suggested in the beta feedback at issue #9802 (comment).

### Expected Behavior
Developers should get a working build by default without needing to know about or configure the `output.ecmaVersion` setting. This aligns with the goal of a zero-configuration setup.

### Motivation and Use Case
By using the `browserslist` configuration, Webpack can automatically set the appropriate ECMAScript version based on the project's target browsers. This reduces the need for developers to manually configure `output.ecmaVersion`, making the build process more seamless and reducing the likelihood of errors due to misconfiguration.

### Implementation Suggestions
@vankop and @evilebottnawi have provided some implementation suggestions in the comments following the linked issue. These suggestions can serve as a starting point for further discussion and development.

### Willingness to Contribute
I do not currently have the time to work on this myself, so I cannot guarantee my involvement in the implementation.
