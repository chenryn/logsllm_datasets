User: Please write a Python script that can automatically download all files in a specified folder from an FTP server.
Assistant: The following is a Python script that can download all files in a specified folder from an FTP server: ```python import os import ftplib # FTP login information hostname = 'ftp.example.com' username = 'your_username' password = 'your_password' # Folder path and local storage path to download files remote_folder_path = '/remote_folder' local_folder_path = '/local_folder' # Create FTP connection ftp = ftplib.FTP(hostname) ftp.login(username, password) # Go to the one to download Folder path ftp.cwd(remote_folder_path) # Get a list of files and download files in a loop = ftp.nlst() for file in files: local_file_path = os.path.join(local_folder_path, file) with open(local_file_path, 'wb') as local_file: ftp.retrbinary('RETR '+ file, local_file.write) # Close the FTP connection ftp.quit() ``` To use this script, just put the FTP login information, the folder path to download the file and the local storage Replace the path with an appropriate value, then run the script on the command line. Note that this script will download all files in the specified folder, including files in subfolders. If you only want to download the files in the specified folder, you can filter out the files in the folder and download them when getting the file list.
