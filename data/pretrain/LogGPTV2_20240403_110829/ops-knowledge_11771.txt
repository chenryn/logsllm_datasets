User: Please introduce the basic concepts of Docker containers, including container images, container warehouses, container networks, etc.
Assistant: 1. Container image A container image is the basis of a container. It is a lightweight executable software package that contains all the files and configuration information needed to run a container. Each image can contain one or more software components, and users can use the image to start the container and run the application in it. 2. Container warehouse The container warehouse is a centralized storage space for storing Docker container images, which can be used to store and share container images. The warehouse can be public or private, and users can upload their own images to the warehouse for storage and management. 3. Container network Container network refers to the technology to realize container intercommunication in Docker. The container network can enable different containers to communicate with each other, and can communicate with the host and other networks. Docker uses the default network by default, and can also implement intercommunication between containers through a user-defined network. Through the container network, functions such as container load balancing and high availability can be realized.
