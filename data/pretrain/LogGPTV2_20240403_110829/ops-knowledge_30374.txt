User:  How to install Nginx and configure reverse proxy on the server?
Assistant: The following are the steps to install Nginx and configure the reverse proxy on the Ubuntu operating system: 1. Update the software package of the operating system: ``` sudo apt-get update ``` 2. Install Nginx on the server: ``` sudo apt -get install nginx ``` 3. Start Nginx: ``` sudo systemctl start nginx ``` 4. Check whether Nginx is running: ``` sudo systemctl status nginx ``` 5. Configure reverse proxy: In Nginx default Add the following content to `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default` in the configuration file: ``` server { listen 80; server_name example.com; location / { proxy_pass http://localhost:3000; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; } } ``` In the above example, Nginx accepts all requests from example.com and forwards them to the local port 3000. Among them, `proxy_pass` specifies the target address of the reverse proxy, and `proxy_set_header` is used to add additional information to the HTTP request header. For example, `Host` specifies the domain name of the request, and `X-Real-IP` specifies the real IP address of the client. 6. Verify that the configuration file is correct: ``` sudo nginx -t ``` 7. Reload Nginx to apply the configuration file: ``` sudo systemctl reload nginx ``` The reverse proxy should now be properly configured and ready to go Handle requests from example.com and forward them to local port 3000.
