User: I've implemented an app engine server in Python for processing html documents sent to it. It's all well and good when I run it locally, but when running off the App engine, I get the following error:
"413. That’s an error. Your client issued a request that was too large. That’s all we know."
The request is only 155KB, and I thought the app engine request limit was 10MB. I've verified that I haven't exceeded any of the daily quotas, so anyone know what might be going on?
Thanks in advance!

Assistant: Looks like it was because I was making a GET request. Changing it to POST fixed it.
