not have a privacy policy even though the majority of the apps
request access to at least one permission that would enable
them to access personal data. In 2017, Alhadlaq et al. [8]
performed a small analysis on Alexa skills (around 10,000
skills at the time) and found that 75 % of the skills did not
have a privacy policy and 70 % of the existing policies did not
mention anything speciﬁc to Alexa.

Distinction from prior work.
In this paper, we present a
large-scale systematic evaluation of the overall skill ecosys-
tem, and identify ﬂaws in the vetting process using proof-
of-concepts. Table I highlights how our paper compares with
other existing related works. We highlight ways in which the
backend code can be updated to trigger dormant intents, which
can deceive users into giving up sensitive data – something that
has not been previously discussed or demonstrated. Zhang et
al. [56] state that an attacker can swap backend audio ﬁles
without providing concise details, whereas we demonstrate
(by publishing a skill) how an attacker can register dormant
intents of sensitive data types (Section V-C). We also showcase
how an attacker can register skills using well-known developer
names (e.g., Ring, Withings, Samsung) to deceive users into
enabling phishing skills (Section V). We furthermore perform a
large-scale empirical analysis to summarize the potential skill-
squatting techniques/patterns observed in the wild; existing
literature [55], [35] has mainly focused on showcasing how
one speciﬁc approach can cause skill squatting. We also
use a semi-automated approach to determine the efﬁcacy of
different squatting patterns — something that existing literature
does not evaluate (Section VI). Lastly, we study skill privacy
policies. Though, Alhadlaq et al. [8] provided an overview
of privacy policy availability, our work is eight times larger
than their analysis, covering categories that their overview
missed (e.g., kids). Furthermore, while prior work stopped
analysis at availability, we are the ﬁrst to highlight potential
COPPA violations, deﬁcient enforcement of the privacy policy
mandate, permission-to-policy inconsistencies, and root-cause
analysis showing templates are causing potential violations
of regulatory requirements (Section VII). We believe these
ﬁndings are signiﬁcant contributions over the prior work.

We honored Amazon’s “robots.txt” restrictions and only down-
loaded the skill information pages. Still our attempts were
limited by Amazon’s API protection mechanism from time to
time (less than 1 % of the requests), where we were redirected
to a “Robot Check” website; we downloaded each such page
after waiting for several minutes. The data is available to the
research community for further analysis [4].
IV. COLLECTING SKILL DATA
B. Brief Summary of Skill Metadata
A. Data Collection Setup
We collected data from Alexa skill stores [49] across
seven countries: United States (US), United Kingdom (UK),
Australia (AU), Canada (CA), Germany (DE), Japan (JP) and
France (FR). We performed data collection in January, 2020.
We used Selenium to automatically access a skill page and
downloaded various information available on the page. To
avoid geo-blocking, we crawled from servers located in data
centers within each region of interest.3 We ﬁrst accessed all
skills listed in different categories and also extracted additional
skills listed under the “recommended skills” section of each
page. The HTML ﬁles were parsed using Python to extract
information about each skill’s title, invocation name, required
3For example, the US skill Store is not accessible from an European-bound
IP address.
All skill stores use the same taxonomy to organize skills
into 21 different categories. Table II shows the number of skills
available in each store. We collected a total of 150,708 skills
listed across all stores, of which 90,194 were unique. The
numbers exceed the 80,000 reported by Amazon [24] in 2019.
Out of the unique skills 11,192 were available in all English-
speaking skill stores (US, UK, CS, AU). Only 538 skills were
common across the European skill stores (UK, FR, DE) and
163 skills were available in all seven countries. In terms of
privacy policies we see that on average around 24.2 % of the
skills provide a privacy policy link. Some of the European
stores (like FR and DE) had relatively higher numbers of skills
(30–40 %) with a privacy policy link.
We also looked at the overlap among the different stores.
Table III summarizes the number of skills and developers over-
lapping across the different stores. We found 102 developers

to publish skills to all the seven stores with “Invoked Apps
LLC.” [3] offering the highest number of skills (54 skills on
average) in all stores. This number was signiﬁcantly higher
among English-speaking countries where a total of 5,567
developers publish in all four English-speaking stores. For
the English-speaking stores, a developer by the name ‘sachin
nelwade’ was the most prevalent publisher (over 400 skills in
all of the English-speaking stores). These numbers suggest that
while it is common for developers to publish skills in several
stores, each store has its own set of unique developers and
this is evident from the diagonal elements of Table III. Unless
otherwise stated, we use the US dataset for most evaluations
as it contains the most number of unique skills.
C. Research Ethics
To evaluate how Amazon’s skill certiﬁcation process works
we created several skills for multiple purposes, e.g., registering
skills under well-known company names and skills requesting
phone numbers or zip codes from users verbally without
registering a permission-protected intent, and testing activation
of skills with identical invocation name. We created skills
running on AWS Lambdas as well as ones backed by external
endpoints. We did not collect any user data through the skills
published, and we removed skills that could infringe a user’s
privacy immediately after they passed Amazon’s certiﬁcation
process. We informed Amazon of our ﬁndings and they are
currently conducting further investigation on them.
V. LOOPHOLES IN SKILL VETTING
In this section, we answer RQ1: What limitations exist in
the current skill vetting process? We perform a systematic
analysis of the skill registration and certiﬁcation process to
identify potential pitfalls that might be exploitable by an
attacker. First, we try to understand how Alexa selects a
skill, among skills with the same invocation names. Next, we
investigate if an attacker can register skills using any arbitrary
developer/company name to potentially facilitate phishing at-
tacks. We then test how easy it is for an adversary to trick
users into revealing sensitive information by making backend
code changes after a skill is certiﬁed. Lastly, we analyze how
well Amazon mediates the collection of sensitive data.
A. Duplicate Skill Invocation Names
Over the years, Amazon has made it easier for users to
enable Alexa skills. When Amazon ﬁrst introduced Alexa,
users had to enable skills either through the app or through
their online account. In 2016, it became possible to explicitly
enable skills with a voice command, and since mid 2017, Alexa

invocation name.
now automatically enables skills if the user utters the right
invocation name [39], [52], favoring native or ﬁrst-party skills
that are developed and maintained by Amazon [52]. Amazon,
however, does not prevent non-native skills from sharing the
same invocation name. Figure 3 shows the number of skills that
have the same invocation phrases across the seven skill stores.
From Figure 3, we see that a large number of skills share the
same invocation name (as evident from the data points to the
right of the line x = 1, which indicates that there are multiple
skills with the same invocation name). In the US skill store, we
found 9,948 skills that share the same invocation name with
at least one other skill. Across all skill stores, we only found
36,055 skills with a unique invocation name. This makes it all
the more important that when users install a skill by name, they
get the skill they intend. Auto-enabling skills means that third-
party developers can now target certain skills and register new
skills with the same invocation phrase. For example, if you ask
for “space facts” there are 81 such skills, of which Amazon
automatically selects one. If the user’s request does not match
a skill’s invocation name, Alexa automatically tries to fulﬁll
the request by presenting the user with a list of probable skills
to choose from [14]. Existing studies [56], [55], [35] have
highlighted the existence of many duplicate skills, however,
none of them have thoroughly analyzed how Alexa prioritizes
among skills sharing the same invocation name.
The actual criteria that Amazon uses to auto-enable a
skill among several skills with the same invocation names is
unknown to the public. We, therefore, attempt to infer if certain
skill attributes are statistically correlated with how Amazon
prioritizes skills with the same invocation name. To understand
