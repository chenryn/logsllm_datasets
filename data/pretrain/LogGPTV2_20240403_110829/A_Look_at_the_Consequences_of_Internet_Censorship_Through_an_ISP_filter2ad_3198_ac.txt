### Active Testing and ISP Detection

The active testing method involves verifying the authenticity of responses. If `ASNtrace` is associated with an ISP within Pakistan, while `ASNreal` is not, it indicates that the query received a false response. This technique, however, has limitations. It cannot detect cases where the censor's redirection points to an IP address belonging to an AS outside the country. Similarly, it fails to identify null-routing by censors. Additionally, this method may flag caching servers within the country as potential censors.

### TCP/IP Blocking

IP-level blocking can be an ambiguous indicator of censorship, as it is difficult to distinguish from legitimate causes of inaccessibility. However, we can eliminate some non-censorship cases because censorship typically requires that all attempts to establish a connection to a blocked address will fail. To identify such IP addresses, we use the following heuristic:

1. **Iterate over A records**: For each correctly resolved A record, label the connections based on the following states:
   - **PARTIAL**: No SYN packet from the originator, but packets observed from the responder.
   - **EST**: Full TCP establishment handshake observed.
   - **BLOCKED**: The originator sent a SYN but received no response or a TCP RST (potentially injected by the censor).

2. **Flag IP addresses**: We flag IP addresses for which we never observe `EST` and at least once observe `BLOCKED`. These flagged IP addresses are then mapped back to their corresponding domain names in the DNS logs, and these domains are considered potentially censored.

### HTTP Level Blocking

At the HTTP level, censors can block content via:
- **No HTTP Response**: This can occur for legitimate reasons. For known censored content, consistent TCP-layer blocking confirms censorship.
- **Error Response Codes**: These can be ambiguous due to legitimate reasons like resources not found or forbidden. For known censored content, this provides a strong indicator if it is the dominant behavior.
- **Block Page via 3XX Redirection**: Censors may redirect diverse domains/sub-domains to the same location. This can be detected by analyzing histograms of the `Location` header in responses. If censors redirect different content to distinct locations, the histogram will not reveal a common target.
- **Block Page via 2XX Response**: Censors may send the same block page for multiple URLs. This can be detected by fingerprinting known block pages or by investigating spikes in the histogram of the number of bytes sent in server responses.

### Identifying YouTube Censorship

Table 4 shows our findings for deducing the mechanism of YouTube censorship in Pakistan at two different points in time.

- **DNS Redirection**: Both traces show DNS redirection for queries resolved using the ISP’s DNS resolvers. Non-ISP resolvers provided correct answers.
- **IP Blocking**: No significant IP blocking was observed, except for one potentially blocked address in 18Sep12, which reverse-mapped to a YouTube content server.
- **HTTP Level Blocking**: In addition to DNS-based blocking, we observed HTTP-level blocking. In 18Sep12, blocking occurred via 3XX redirection to an IP owned by a large local provider. In 02Aug13, the blocking shifted to no response, with nearly all requests reset by the responder.

These observations confirm the two-layered censorship mechanism described in prior studies, where ISPs use DNS redirection, and the two large providers with direct international connectivity (PTCL and TWA) employ HTTP-level blocking.

### Identifying Porn Censorship

To accurately identify porn censorship, we used McAfee’s URL categorization service to label websites as pornography. We spot-checked a random sample to confirm accuracy and found no errors.

- **DNS Redirection**: Evidence of DNS redirection was found in all four traces. All ISP resolvers consistently redirected blocked queries to the same ISP-owned address, while non-ISP resolvers resolved them correctly.
- **IP Blocking**: Some porn domains showed signs of IP blocking, particularly in 18Sep12, with a 41% overlap with the DNS blacklist. The TCP state indicated blackholing.
- **HTTP Block Pages**: No instances of users receiving HTTP block pages were found. Some domains consistently received no response, but with negligible overlap with the DNS blacklist, except in the last trace.

Based on these observations, we did not find extensive evidence of IP- or HTTP-level blocking for porn, except where there was a high overlap with the DNS blacklist.

### Evolution of Porn Blacklist

Table 6 illustrates the evolution of the porn blacklist over time. We found that 8.2% of the unique porn domains in pre-block traces were blocked in 21Dec11. After the initial dissemination, updates were infrequent, with only about 35 new domains added in subsequent traces. The new blocked domains had little overlap with previously unblocked domains, suggesting that the central regulator disseminates blacklists independently of user browsing trends.

### Summary

Table 4 summarizes the mechanisms of censorship for YouTube and porn. DNS-level redirection was observed in all post-block traces. In 18Sep12, YouTube was blocked using HTTP redirection, and porn using IP blocking. In 02Aug13, both were blocked using RST injection.

### Metrics Relevant to Content Providers

We discuss two key aspects: what constitutes a "content provider" and the metrics for assessing changes resulting from censorship events.

- **Content Providers**: For YouTube, we focused on major video content platforms (YouTube, DailyMotion, Tune.pk, Vimeo). For porn, we considered all domains identified by McAfee’s URL categorization service.
- **Primary Metric**: Downstream traffic (server response bytes) served by blocked and alternate content providers, abbreviated as "bandwidth." This metric captures user interest in content providers, especially for heavy download categories like video and porn.
- **Additional Metric for Video Content**: Changes in content embedded in other sites, capturing the broader ecosystem for video viewing.

### Computing Metrics

- **Direct vs. Embedded Video Requests**: We developed signatures to classify URLs as direct or embedded by analyzing URI root prefixes and content types.
- **Bandwidth per Content Provider**: We estimated traffic volume by accumulating server bytes for HTTP requests where the content provider domain appears in the `Host` or `Referer` headers, considering the complexities of CDNs.

By combining these approaches, we can effectively estimate the impact of censorship on content providers.
