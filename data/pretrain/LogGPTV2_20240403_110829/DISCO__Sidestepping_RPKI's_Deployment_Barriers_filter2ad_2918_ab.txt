The above measurement results indicate that certifying de
facto ownership applies to the vast majority of IP blocks
advertised in BGP. All these blocks can beneﬁt from DISCO.
B. Inherent Limitations
De facto ownership is not without its limitations. In par-
ticular, IP preﬁxes not advertised in BGP may have a legal
owner, but not a de facto owner (as no AS is advertising itself
as the owner of these preﬁxes in BGP). The absence of a de
facto owner implies that de facto ownership certiﬁcation alone
is unsuitable for such preﬁxes.
Another limitation of de facto ownership is when multiple
ASes originate the same preﬁx. As our results in §III-A show,
BGP advertisements observed by RouteViews and RIPE RIS
vantage points on Nov. 1st, 2018 and Aug. 1st, 2019 reveal that
only a small fraction of preﬁxes are advertised simultaneously
by multiple ASes. Table I summarizes the results for both IP
protocols.
In §VIII, we describe extensions to DISCO to address
these issues.
IV. OVERVIEW
In this section we present an overview of DISCO’s goals,
components, and threats it protects against.
A. Goals
As we will show, “settling” for de facto ownership enables
DISCO to meet the following design goals:
Security against preﬁx hijacks. DISCO is designed to protect
against the most common and alarming preﬁx-hijacking attacks
2When constructing IP blocks for this analysis, we ignore announcements
for IPv4 preﬁxes longer than /25 and IPv6 preﬁxes longer than /64 preﬁxes
(e.g., announcements to blackhole trafﬁc during DDoS attacks [32]). We also
ignore IP preﬁxes that are announced less than 20% of the time.

facto owner (prevalence = 1).

INTRODUCING DE FACTO OWNERSHIP
To overcome the obstacles facing RPKI adoption, we argue
the classic desideratum of certifying legal ownership
that
of IP preﬁxes should be substituted for certiﬁcation of de
facto ownership over IP addresses. We use the term de facto
ownership of an IP block to indicate that the AS being certiﬁed
for ownership is the AS to which trafﬁc destined for the
relevant IP addresses is forwarded to over a considerable
amount of time. Trafﬁc sent to almost all routed addresses on
the Internet reaches a single destination AS (with the exception
of multi-origin addresses, which we discuss in §III-B).
Because IP preﬁxes (of different lengths) can overlap, we
deﬁne an IP block as a non-contiguous non-overlapping portion
of the IP address space forwarded to an AS, for which we can
establish de facto ownership. For example, if AS3356 (Level3)
announces P1 = 8.0.0.0/9, AS15169 (Google) announces a
subpreﬁx P2 = 8.8.8.0/24, and considering no other preﬁxes
overlap, we deﬁne two blocks: B1 = P1 \ P2 and B2 = P2.
In the rest of the discussions in this paper, we refer to IP
address blocks, rather than preﬁxes, as the objects in DISCO’s
certiﬁcates to reﬂect the nature of non-contiguous certiﬁcation.
We introduce a system, DISCO, for automated certiﬁcation
of de facto ownership and generation of ﬁltering rules for
ROV. We show below that certifying de facto ownership can
be executed in a manner that guarantees that: (1) Any AS can
certify its own IP addresses. (2) An attacker capable of fooling
DISCO’s certiﬁcation either has no point in doing so (because
they serve as a sole upstream provider of the victim and can
already intercept their trafﬁc) or must launch a highly visible,
long-running attack.
A. Almost All Routable Addresses Have De Facto Owners
To leverage de facto ownership for certiﬁcation purposes,
we must ﬁrst establish that most routed IP blocks have per-
sistent de facto owners. That is, we aim to show that most
IP blocks are advertised by a single origin AS for extended
periods of time.
To investigate the stability of origin AS numbers (ASNs)
for IP blocks on the Internet, we examine routing tables from
all RouteViews and RIPE RIS collectors. The routing tables
were collected midnight (UTC) each day throughout November

centralized control over global Internet routing. DISCO’s
design decouples the certifying entities (the registrars) from
the vantage points that monitor BGP routing information.
This separation allows DISCO to leverage available public
sources of routing information, such as RouteViews and RIPE
RIS, for initial bootstrapping of DISCO (as evidenced by our
implementation and experiments).
Repositories. Similarly to RPKI, DISCO uses public repos-
itories to store and distribute certiﬁcates and ROAs (also
illustrated in Figure 2).
C. Threat Model
Alongside its original goal of protecting ASes from preﬁx
hijacks, DISCO must also protect from attackers that seek to
exploit DISCO itself to adversely inﬂuence Internet routing.
Thus, DISCO is designed to protect against three threats:
•
•
•
that compromised a fraction of
An attacker in control of one or more ASes, which
may choose to advertise in BGP a preﬁx it does not
own from these ASes.
An attacker
the
DISCO registrars, which may attempt to falsely cer-
tify IP address blocks in DISCO. We assume that
most of the registrars are available (for liveness) and
honest (for safety). A registrar is honest if it follows
DISCO’s protocol and receives feeds from a set of
vantage points that is mostly honest (i.e., most vantage
points that feed the registrar provide correct reports of
BGP announcements that they observe).
An attacker in control of a fraction of the DISCO
repositories. The system’s repositories only store cryp-
tographically signed objects (by a quorum of reg-
istrars or the owner of an address block) and are
therefore trustless. We only assume that some honest
repositories are available to guarantee liveness (so
agents can receive DISCO’s certiﬁcates and route
authorizations).
We assume that agents run correct
implementations of
DISCO’s protocol, that private keys of honest participants
remain secret, and that standard cryptographic primitives such
as signatures are secure.
V. DESIGN
We next dive into the mechanics of DISCO’s certiﬁcation
and its protection against routing attacks.
A. Ownership Certiﬁcation
We describe the ownership certiﬁcation procedure fol-
lowing Figure 2. The agent connects to the AS’s border
routers through iBGP sessions. By using iBGP, DISCO avoids
changing the router software or network infrastructure, only
requiring changes to router conﬁguration to set up iBGP
sessions. The agent uses iBGP to initiate the certiﬁcation
process by attaching the origin AS’s public key to the AS’s
route advertisements. Speciﬁcally, DISCO uses a 32 byte
BGP optional transitive attribute. Using an optional transitive

against BGP (like [1], [5], [63]). DISCO’s design targets both
safety—an attacker that is not the de facto owner of a preﬁx
should not be able to certify ownership—and liveness—the
legitimate owner should be able to certify ownership.
Do no harm (security-wise and performance-wise). DISCO
should be safe to deploy. To accomplish this goal, DISCO’s
design is aimed at avoiding the ill effects of human error
by automating certiﬁcation. In particular, DISCO enforces
consistency between certiﬁcates and the BGP control plane
during initialization and delegation to avoid incidents resulting
from human neglect in synchronizing the two. In addition,
DISCO is carefully designed to not harm the performance of
today’s routing system (e.g., by slowing down the processing
of route-advertisements, or by causing route-ﬂapping).
Be readily deployable. We design DISCO to minimize the
operational costs entailed in deploying and running the system.
In addition, to facilitate deployment, DISCO is compatible
with today’s routing infrastructure and, in particular, it does
not involve changes to BGP routers, and eliminates the need
for an adopter to coordinate with other ASes.
B. System Components
Figure 2 illustrates DISCO’s main components.
The agent. A software-implemented agent, installed within
the AS, initiates the certiﬁcation process for address blocks
belonging to that AS by attaching the AS’s public key to its
BGP advertisements using BGP attributes. Once certiﬁed, the
agent issues a ROA associating an AS number with its address
block. By automating ROA issuance, DISCO eliminates the
possibility of human error, which is common in RPKI’s
ROAs (§II). Given DISCO’s certiﬁcates and ROAs, the agent
computes the ﬁltering rules for using ROV on advertisements
from other ASes.
Registrars and vantage points. A registrar continuously
monitors BGP advertisements from a distributed set of van-
tage points to obtain a global view of Internet routing. This
information is used to generate and sign certiﬁcates associ-
ating owners’ public keys with their IP address blocks. We
envision registrars as deployed by different organizations that
are distributed across geographical and political boundaries
4
attribute makes DISCO compatible with the current Internet,
since BGP speakers are meant
to send such attributes to
neighbors even if they do not recognize them [48]. We verify
that this indeed occurs on the Internet in §VII. (Although
BGP communities could, in principle, be an alternate means
of propagating DISCO keys, they are sometimes ﬁltered by
intermediate networks [57].)
A registrar certiﬁes an IP block owner when more than
a predetermined fraction (the certiﬁcation threshold) of the
vantage points that provide it information observe the same
public key attached to the BGP advertisements for an IP preﬁx
for a predetermined period of time (the certiﬁcation interval).
Normally, an announcement carrying DISCO’s attribute would
propagate globally and be received at all vantage points.3
The certiﬁcation threshold prevents an attacker from obtaining
a certiﬁcate by hijacking trafﬁc to a few of the vantage
points that feed a registrar, while providing robustness against
availability errors (e.g., due to temporary connectivity issues
or vantage point unavailability). The certiﬁcation interval en-
sures that short-lived preﬁx hijacks (that propagate through
the global Internet) cannot be used to obtain a certiﬁcate,
but otherwise has minimal impact as legitimate owners can
permanently announce preﬁxes with DISCO’s attribute. When
a registrar approves an owner for some block, it creates a
certiﬁcate, signs it, and sends it to a public repository.
The repository collects signatures from registrars regarding
IP-block-to-public-key associations. When more than a prede-
termined threshold of registrars approves the same associa-
tion, the repository publishes the aggregate of the registrars’
signatures on that association; this aggregate is the DISCO
certiﬁcate. This threshold reﬂects a trade-off between liveness
and security: a certiﬁcate should be generated even if a few
registrars are down or refuse to sign, but should not be
generated if only a few registrars sign. In practice, we expect
most registrars to be up most of the time since they do not serve
public requests and are hence less vulnerable to DoS attacks.
We therefore believe that this threshold should be high.
1) Initial certiﬁcation: DISCO can automatically generate
certiﬁcates for the vast majority of the IP blocks, namely
blocks that have de facto owners (about 97%, see Figure 1);
this immediately allows the owners of these preﬁxes to issue
ROAs. The remaining 3% of the IP blocks include (i) preﬁxes
that recently changed ownership, which will undergo the
certiﬁcation process without issue; (ii) preﬁxes announced by
multiple ASes, which require the multiple owners to coordinate
deployment and announce an attribute with the same public
key (§VIII-B); and (iii) preﬁxes with ongoing hijacks, which
require the legitimate owner to coordinate with other operators
to mitigate the ongoing hijacks before the certiﬁcation process
can succeed.
2) Continuous (re-)certiﬁcation: DISCO’s automated cer-
tiﬁcation procedure has very little overhead (BGP advertise-
ments only include an additional short optional attribute).
This enables the owner to continuously run the certiﬁcation
3Some ASes export partial
feeds to RIPE RIS and RouteViews route
collectors (i.e., only export routes from customers) [49]. These ASes will
not export routes received from peers and providers. They can be identiﬁed
by characterizing their exports or by RIPE RIS and RouteViews (while
coordinating with the AS to establish the BGP session) and thus not considered
when verifying the certiﬁcation threshold.

procedure by incorporating DISCO’s attribute in its BGP
messages. Thus, DISCO registrars can issue short-lived cer-
tiﬁcates, which are renewed often (for example, every few
weeks). Short-lived certiﬁcates have the advantage of avoiding
long-term commitment to public keys, adapting quickly to
changes in ownership, and simplifying revocation procedures
(discussed in §V-A6).
3) Certiﬁcation under attack: DISCO cannot protect
against hijacks when a preﬁx is uncertiﬁed or not covered
by a ROA, similarly to RPKI. This is similar to the initial
certiﬁcation of preﬁxes without de facto owners (§V-A1). In
cases of initial certiﬁcation and partial ROV adoption, ASes
close to the hijacker and that have not deployed ROV need
to be contacted to mitigate the hijack—similar to how preﬁx
hijacks are dealt with in the Internet today.
Preﬁxes with certiﬁcates and active ROAs are harder to at-
tack, as continuous recertiﬁcation happens under the protection
of ROV. When ROV is partially adopted, it partially mitigates
preﬁx hijacks, and recertiﬁcation is more likely to succeed
as ROV adoption increases (incremental beneﬁt during partial
deployment). When ROV is widely adopted, preﬁx hijacks are
