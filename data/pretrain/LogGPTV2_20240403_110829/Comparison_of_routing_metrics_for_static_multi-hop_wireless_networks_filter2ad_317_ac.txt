### Figures and Analysis

#### Bandwidth Stability
- **Figure 4**: The bandwidth of the link from node 65 to node 100 is relatively stable.
- **Figure 5**: The bandwidth of the link from node 68 to node 66 varies over time.
- **Figure 6**: For many node pairs, the bandwidths of the two links between the nodes are unequal.

#### Metrics Comparison
- **Figure 7**: Median throughput of TCP transfer for all pairs.
- **Figure 8**: Median number of paths per TCP transfer for all pairs.
- **Figure 9**: Median path length of a TCP transfer for all pairs.
- **Figure 10**: Comparison of HOP and ETX path lengths. ETX consistently uses longer paths than HOP.

### Performance of Different Metrics

**HOP Metric:**
- The HOP metric produces significantly shorter paths compared to other metrics.
- Figure 9 shows that the median path length using HOP is 2, which is the shortest among all metrics.
- However, as shown in Figure 11, the HOP metric does a poor job of selecting multi-hop paths, leading to lower throughput at longer path lengths.

**ETX Metric:**
- The ETX metric generally outperforms HOP, especially at longer path lengths.
- As illustrated in Figure 10, ETX consistently uses longer paths than HOP, with a median path length of 3.01.
- The ETX metric also uses several paths per connection (median of 4), due to small fluctuations in metric values of equivalent paths.
- We plan to investigate route damping strategies to mitigate this issue.

**RTT Metric:**
- The RTT metric performs the worst among the four metrics.
- This is due to self-interference, where the metric on the initial path rises, causing the connection to switch to another path.
- Figure 8 shows that the RTT metric uses far more paths per connection, with a median of 20.5 paths.

**PktPair Metric:**
- The PktPair metric performs better than RTT but worse than HOP and ETX.
- It eliminates self-interference on the first hop, resulting in a median of 12 paths per connection, which is lower than RTT but higher than HOP and ETX.

### Impact of Path Length

- **Figure 9**: The bar chart shows the median average path length across all 506 TCP transfers. The HOP metric has the shortest median path length (2), followed by ETX (3.01), RTT (3.43), and PktPair (3.58).
- **Figure 10**: Detailed comparison of ETX and HOP path lengths, showing that ETX consistently uses longer paths.

### Further Investigations

- **Self-Interference and Route Flapping:**
  - Self-interference and consequent route flapping experienced with the RTT metric have also been observed in wired networks.
  - Techniques such as converting RTT to utilization and using hysteresis are being investigated to alleviate these issues.
  - Initial results show that hysteresis may reduce the severity of the problem, but not significantly.

- **Future Work:**
  - We plan to further investigate route damping strategies to address the issue of multiple equivalent paths in the ETX metric.
  - Additional research will be conducted to optimize the performance of different metrics, particularly in multi-hop scenarios.
