Abstract—With the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT),
the number of security incidents due to insecure and mis-
conﬁgured IoT devices is increasing. Especially on the con-
sumer market, manufacturers focus on new features and early
releases at the expense of a comprehensive security strategy.
Hence, experts have started calling for regulation of the IoT
consumer market, while policymakers are seeking for suitable
regulatory approaches. We investigate how manufacturers can
be incentivized to increase sustainable security efforts for IoT
products. We propose mandatory security update labels that
inform consumers during buying decisions about the willingness
of the manufacturer to provide security updates in the future.
Mandatory means that the labels explicitly state when security
updates are not guaranteed. We conducted a user study with
more than 1,400 participants to assess the importance of security
update labels for the consumer choice by means of a conjoint
analysis. The results show that the availability of security updates
(until which date the updates are guaranteed) accounts for 8%
to 35% impact on overall consumers’ choice, depending on the
perceived security risk of the product category. For products
with a high perceived security risk, this availability is twice as
important as other high-ranked product attributes. Moreover,
provisioning time for security updates (how quickly the product
will be patched after a vulnerability is discovered) additionally
accounts for 7% to 25% impact on consumers’ choices. The
proposed labels are intuitively understood by consumers, do
not require product assessments by third parties before release,
and have a potential to incentivize manufacturers to provide
sustainable security support.
I. INTRODUCTION
In 1999, Kevin Ashton coined the term ‘Internet of
Things’ [1] as the headline of a marketing presentation that
promoted an idea of utilizing radio-frequency identiﬁcation
(RFID) in supply chains. By now, Internet of Things evolved
into a major technological paradigm: everyday items, house-
hold appliances, and mobile devices are interconnected via
wireless networks and the Internet. Gartner [2] predicts that
the majority of IoT devices, 12.9 billion units (63%), will be
installed in the consumer sector by 2020, and thus, consumer
products play a prominent role in the expansion of the IoT.
Recent academic and industrial user studies [3]–[6] doc-
ument various security concerns regarding the usage of IoT
products. At least since the denial-of-service attacks against
Internet infrastructure by the Mirai botnet [7] in 2016, security
experts have started to demand regulatory interventions. “Our
choice isn’t between government involvement and no gov-
ernment involvement”, says Bruce Schneier in his testimony
before a committee of the U.S. House of Representatives [8],
“Our choice is between smarter government involvement and
stupider government involvement”. Current policy approaches
in the U.S. include a bill for establishing guidelines for the ac-
quisition of secure IoT products by governmental agencies [9]
as well as a Californian bill [10] obligating manufacturers to
equip IoT devices with reasonable security features. In the
EU, baseline security recommendations for IoT were published
by the European Union Agency for Network and Information
Security (ENISA) [11]. A task force from academia, industry,
and societal organizations proposed a policy for vulnerability
disclosure in the EU that also concerns IoT products [12].
The deﬁcient IoT security can be at least partly attributed to
missing economic incentives for manufacturers. To be success-
ful on the market, manufacturers have to attract consumers and
complementers [13], [14]. Consumers reward an early market
entry and new functional features, while complementers favor
systems that allow easy compatibility with their products.
These demands contradict the security design that usually adds
complexity to systems. In addition, releasing an innovative
product to the market requires many resources, and since
resources are ﬁnite, they are withdrawn from non-functional
features, such as comprehensive security mechanisms [15].
The missing incentives for securing IoT consumer products
originate from the consumers’ inability to compare security
properties of different products. The concept of an asymmetric
information barrier between buyers and sellers, which also
affects other properties, such as energy consumption and
product quality, is known in the economic theory as ‘the
market for lemons’ [16]. This theory states that consumers
are not willing to pay a price premium for something they
cannot measure. In fact, even manufacturers might not have
the complete knowledge about the strength of their products’
security [14]. Reasons might be a lack of experience in
designing Internet-connected technologies or the outsourcing
of a product’s security development to original equipment
manufacturers (OEMs).
Contributions: Firstly, we propose and examine mandatory
security update labels, a novel idea for a regulatory framework
that complements ongoing regulation efforts. We do not call

for security testing and certiﬁcation to keep “insecure” prod-
ucts off the market. Instead, we explore to which extent market
forces can be utilized to elicit manufacturers to sustainably
support their products’ software with security updates. Secu-
rity update labels enable an informed choice regarding security
properties of IoT consumer products. They transform the
asymmetric information about the manufacturer’s willingness
to provide security updates into two intuitively assessable and
comparable product attributes: availability period, i.e., for how
long the manufacturer guarantees to provide security updates
(e.g., ‘until 12/2016’), as well as provisioning time, i.e., within
which timeframe after a vulnerability notiﬁcation a security
patch is provided (e.g., ‘within 30 days’). These labels are
inspired by established regulations, such as energy labels.
Secondly, we empirically examine the impact of security
update labels on the consumers’ choice. Although security
patching is discussed by experts as one of the most effective
countermeasure against insecure IoT devices, the impact of
guaranteeing security updates on the consumers’ decisions has
not been empirically assessed so far. We conducted a user
study with more than 1,400 participants that measured the
relative importance of the availability period and provisioning
time of security updates for buying decisions. To this end, we
used conjoint analysis, a well-established method in marketing
research [17], [18], which has also been used in courts to
calculate damages of patent and copyright infringements [19].
In a nutshell, a number of ﬁctitious product proﬁles, each
described by a set of attributes, is shown to respondents in
multiple iterations. They are asked which of the presented
products they would prefer to buy (with the option to refuse
buying any of the products). Based on these choice results,
conjoint analysis determines a preference model that measures
the relative importance and utility of each attribute.
Study Results: We found that the guarantee of providing
security updates has a high impact on buying decisions. We
examined two product categories, one with a high and one
with a low perceived security risk. Among all assessed product
attributes, the availability period of security updates was the
most important one: For the product with the high perceived
security risk, its relative importance on the overall consumers’
choice of 31% is at least twice as high as the importance of
other attributes. For the product with the low perceived secu-
rity risk, availability had a lower relative importance of 20%
for the consumers’ choice. Additionally, consumers prefer a
shorter provisioning time (10 days) over a longer provisioning
time (30 days), and dislike longer provisioning times for
products with a high perceived security risk. Demographic
characteristics play a minor role, while the sensitivity for
security risks has an impact on the consumers’ choice.
With this work, we address policymakers and security
researchers that are seeking for promising directions to foster
sustainable security efforts for IoT consumer products.
II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
We provide background and related work on product label-
ing and conjoint analysis in this section.
A. Product Labeling
Product labeling is used in many countries to inform con-
sumers about intangible features of products and to enable
product comparison during buying decisions. The Federal
Trade Commission (FTC) issues product
labeling policies
in the USA, while each member state of the EU runs its
own institution that enforces regulations deﬁned by the EU
Commission. Prominent examples are energy labels. In the
USA, energy labels were introduced in 2007 [20] by the FTC
and show the energy consumption and the estimated annual
operating costs. In 2010, The EU followed with a similar
approach by introducing the Energy Efﬁciency Directive [21].
Prior research on the effectiveness of energy labeling [22]–[24]
concluded that consumers are aware of these labels, understand
them, and that energy labels inﬂuence consumers’ buying
decisions.
In 2017, the German government [25] evaluated an idea
of lifetime labels on electronic products. Their label design
showed a color-gradient
lifespan between 0 (red) and 20
(green) years. In a user study with a representative sample,
discrete-choice experiments (but not conjoint analysis) simu-
lated online shopping scenarios. The results showed that while
the lifespan attribute was recognized by consumers, its impact
on buying decisions was less than the impact of other product
attributes, e.g., price and brand. Their label did not concern
security features, but the functional lifespan of a product.
B. Security & Privacy Labels and Regulatory Approaches
In the academic research, the adaption of product labels
for privacy information was examined in user studies. Kelley
et al. [26], [27] investigated whether food nutrition labels
can be adapted to make privacy policies of websites more
understandable. Tsai et al. [28] evaluated whether consumers
would pay a higher price for a product offered by an online
shop with a strict privacy policy as compared to a less privacy-
protecting shop. Their results suggest
that consumers are
willing to pay a price premium for higher privacy if privacy
information is salient and understandable.
Independently and concurrently to our work, Emami-Naeini
et al. [6] developed a security and privacy label for IoT
consumer products. In contrast to our proposal, their label
includes ratings that require third-party product testing before
release. They tested their label in an interview study with 24
users and a survey with 200 respondents. Emami-Naeini et
al. did not conduct a conjoint analysis but directly asked the
users to rate the importance of security and privacy on their
buying decisions. They concluded that importance of security
and privacy depends on the product category: whereas they are
important when buying a home camera or a smart thermostat,
they are not important when buying a smart toothbrush. We
found a similar effect in our study. Our and their studies
complement and validate each other’s results using different
methods.
Mandatory security update labels represent a possible ap-
proach to regulate the IoT product market with regard to
security. Chattopadhyay et al. [29] consider this economic

of all, an appropriate scale to measure security properties is
required. We need a security scale that
C. Conjoint Analysis
Conjoint analysis is one of the major methods to measure
the impact of product attributes on the consumers’ buying
decisions [30]. The basic idea of conjoint analysis is that
respondents are asked to state their preference for buying
ﬁctitious products. The product proﬁles are described by a
limited set of attributes, e.g., size, color, and price. All further
attributes of the product are assumed to be constant.
There are different types of conjoint analysis. Among them,
choice-based conjoint (CBC) is used in 79% of the conjoint
surveys [31]. In CBC, which we use in this work as well,
the respondents receive multiple (usually randomly generated)
subsets of 3 to 5 product proﬁles (so-called choice sets), of
which they select the most desirable product.
Considering the overall preference (i.e., combination of all
buying decisions) as dependent variable and the attributes
of the product as independent variables, a conjoint analysis
assesses the relative importance of product’s attributes. For
example, relative importance of the attribute ‘color’ for buying
decisions can be assessed. Conjoint analysis also evaluates the
importance of the different characteristics of a single attribute,
e.g., whether the change of a product’s color would have
positive or negative effects on the consumers’ choice.
In the past decades, conjoint analysis has been applied to
numerous commercial projects [32] and is by far the most
widely-used methodology in marketing research to analyze
consumer trade-offs in buying decisions [17]. Conjoint anal-
ysis is also used in other areas, e.g., to assess the patients’
preferences in the healthcare sector [33]. Furthermore, it is a
recognized methodology to calculate damages of patent and
copyright infringement in court cases [19]. A famous example
was Apple’s $2.5 billion law suit against Samsung, in which
Apple estimated the ﬁnancial damages of the alleged patent
infringement based on conjoint analysis [34].
Conjoint analysis has also previously been used to investi-
gate the effects of product labels [35]–[37] on the consumers’
choice. Sammer and W¨ustenhagen [38] analyzed the impact of
energy labels on the buying decisions concerning light bulbs
and washing machines of Swiss consumers. However, we are
the ﬁrst to use conjoint analysis to assess the importance of a
security-related label.
III. SECURITY LABELS FOR CONSUMERS
Inspired by the success of existing product labels, we pro-
pose a label that enables users to compare security properties
during buying decisions. We present the idea of a regulatory
framework that accompanies the label, and discuss concerns
that ﬁnally motivate the user study.
A. Security Scales for Labeling
Learning from the success of the energy labeling initiatives,
we asked how we can use a similar approach for security. First
1) can be intuitively understood by consumers, even if they
have no security expertise;
2) enables them to easily compare products, as comparison
lays the foundation for the choice between products;
3) and ﬁnally, does not require third-party product testing
for market release.
The last requirement is based on the following considera-
tions: Third-party testing is a long and costly procedure that
might considerably delay the release of a new product. This
involves the danger that manufacturers would choose testing
laboratories that perform a relaxed and fast evaluation [39],
[40], which again could lead to a false sense of security.
In prior work, a number of security scales has been proposed
that could be applied to IoT products. Many of them (e.g., [41],
[42]) are based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System
(CVSS) [43] and used to categorize the seriousness and impact
of existing security vulnerabilities. Although CVSS can serve
as an indicator of future security properties, it cannot solely
measure the current level of product security, as it is based on
past vulnerability records.
The time-to-compromise (TTC) [44] scale originated from
the concept of the working time required to break a physical
safe. In terms of IoT consumer products, this metric could
measure the time it takes to break the security mechanisms of
a product. According to our criteria, TTC is not applicable as
it requires a third party to assess the product’s security.
A security scale might also show levels of a security certi-
ﬁcation scheme. However, besides the need for a third party,
security certiﬁcation is not suitable to communicate security
levels to consumers, as it might be misleading: Whereas
consumers may assume that the whole product is certiﬁed, in
reality only a subset of the components might be certiﬁed [39].
B. Security Update Labels
We conclude that, to the best of our knowledge, there are
no suitable approaches to communicate the security level of
an IoT product
to consumers. And even if manufacturers
would implement comprehensive security measures, security
ﬂaws in IoT products cannot be fully prevented. Prior research
[45], [46] concluded that well-engineered code has an average
defect rate of around 2 defects per 1,000 lines of code. If we
accept the possibility of security vulnerabilities even in well-
designed systems, the best approach would be to continuously
support the repair of such defects as soon as they are disclosed.
We propose a regulatory framework that demands brand-
giving manufacturers to deﬁne an update policy for each IoT
consumer product with the following properties:
Availability period: The availability of security updates de-
termines the absolute timeframe in which the manufacturer
ensures the patching of security vulnerabilities in the prod-
uct’s software. In other words, it deﬁnes until which date
(for example: ‘12/2024’) the manufacturer contractually
warrants to provide security updates.

Provisioning time: When a security vulnerability in the soft-
ware of an IoT consumer product was reported, the manu-
facturer has to investigate this issue and patch the software
if needed. The update policy deﬁnes the maximum time-
frame (for example: ‘30 days’) within which the manufac-
turer guarantees to provide software security updates.
Both attributes must be printed as a security update label
on each adequate product such that consumers can compare
this information when making a buying decision. The label
content does not need to be authorized by a third party before
the market release, similarly to the mandatory energy labels. If
a manufacturer refuses to guarantee security updates, the label
should explicitly display ‘no security updates guaranteed’ or
a similar phrase.
C. An Idea for a Regulatory Framework
Following the example of the legislations for energy la-
beling [21], [47], market surveillance and consumer protec-
tion authorities should supervise the implementation of the
security update labels, and conduct promotional and educa-
tional information campaigns in the introduction phase. We
propose that each applicable product displays the label on
the packaging, such that it can be considered and compared
during buying decisions, and on the device itself to inform
the consumer about the guaranteed availability of security
updates after deployment. These labels should be mandatory
for each consumer product that is able to directly or indirectly
(e.g., over Bluetooth) connect to the Internet. The liability
should be enforced only between the brand-giving company
that is responsible for the deﬁnition of the update policy,
and the buyer of the product. All further interactions between
the brand-giving company and OEMs or other involved third
parties should be regulated by the market.
The vulnerability disclosure can be implemented in many
ways. An approach might be to set up a public vulnerability
reporting platform. This platform could ensure the documen-
tation of the reported vulnerabilities and would act as an
information channel where the manufacturer announces the
