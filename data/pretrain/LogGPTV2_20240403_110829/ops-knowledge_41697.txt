User: Please describe common types of cybersecurity threats and provide recommendations for mitigating attacks.
Assistant: 1. Viruses: can infect computers through email, social media, download files, unsafe websites, etc., destroying files and systems. Suggestion: Regularly upgrade and update anti-virus software, and do not download files and software from unknown sources. 2. Hacking: Hackers can break into systems, steal sensitive information, tamper with data, and damage systems. Recommendations: Use strong passwords and change them regularly, use multi-layer authentication, and regularly check systems for security vulnerabilities. 3. Phishing: Scammers trick people into providing personal and sensitive information through fake emails, social media, and websites. Recommendation: Educate employees to spot fake emails, social media and websites, and not to click on suspicious links and download suspicious attachments. 4. Denial of service attack: Hackers send a large amount of data requests, making the service unable to respond to normal user requests. Suggestions: Configure firewalls and traffic filters, reduce server load, upgrade software, and regularly test system performance. 5. Data breach: Sensitive data is stolen or leaked, which can lead to information leakage and even serious financial loss and reputational problems. Recommendation: Protect data with data encryption, access control and authentication technologies, back up data regularly and store it in a safe place. 6. Social engineering attack: Hackers obtain target information through attacks on human psychology. Suggestion: Strengthen security education and training for internal employees and external users, and improve their security awareness and vigilance.
