### Administrators and Log Maintenance

Administrators play a crucial role in maintaining and securing computing systems against attacks. They also handle the duplication of real-time up-keeping, ensuring that the system remains consistent and functional. However, the heterogeneity in computing units and log structures can lead to inconsistencies (Henze et al., 2017; Reiss et al., 2012; Sato et al., 2016). This makes it challenging to make the logs machine-understandable.

### Semantic Web and Machine-Understandable Data

The semantic web is a promising technology for making data more understandable by machines. Researchers are working on developing social machines (Hendler & Berners-Lee, 2010) that can semantically interact and share information. Additionally, extracting relevant information from logs is essential (Henze et al., 2017).

### Trustworthiness and Logging Schemes

The trustworthiness of a service provider is closely tied to the accuracy of logged activities and the sharing of such statistics, which contributes to stakeholders' trust. A logging scheme should include methods to share activity statistics to establish its trustworthiness (Ali et al., 2017).

### Known Types of Attacks on Logging Schemes

A comprehensive log management system includes functions such as log generation, collection, transfer, storage, and analysis. Each function is vulnerable to different threats and vulnerabilities. Malicious users can disrupt the entire log management process. Some common types of attacks include:

- **Reorder Attack**: In log recordings, the sequence of actions and their timestamps are critical. Any change in the order of messages before distribution can alter the semantics of the messages (Henze et al., 2017).
- **Privacy Attack**: Log data contains sensitive information about users and their activities, which can be leaked by attackers, leading to privacy issues (Henze et al., 2017).

### Literature Review Process

To conduct this survey in information systems, we followed the guidelines for systematic literature review (SLR) proposed by Chitu Okoli (Okoli, 2015). The methodology consists of eight steps, as shown in Figure 3.

#### Steps Followed - Review Methodology

1. **Identify the Purpose**: The purpose of this SLR is to review available methods for log security to meet the requirements/parameters of secure and trusted information systems.
2. **Draft Protocol and Train the Team**: A simple yet comprehensive protocol was developed to find literature describing methods or schemes for log security.
3. **Apply Practical Screen**: Selected literature (summarized in Table 3) was screened to identify practical solutions and applications, resulting in 19 shortlisted papers.
4. **Search for Literature**: Further exploration of the screened literature was conducted with reference to the security parameters in Table 2.
5. **Extract Data**: A comparative table (Table 4) was populated by exploring the selected literature with reference to their features/functions.
6. **Appraise Quality**: The applicability and usage of the compared log security schemes were critically analyzed.
7. **Synthesize Studies**: Available schemes were explored and analyzed with the requirements of log security, and additional features for enhancing log security schemes were highlighted.
8. **Writing the Review**: After synthesizing the results, weaknesses of existing schemes and guidelines for securing logs were proposed.

#### Research Questions

Based on the forensic requirements of information systems, the following research questions were formulated:
- What are the existing techniques for log security?
- What methodologies are being followed in these log-securing techniques?
- What implications will these findings have when creating new systems?
- What are the limitations of these techniques?

#### Literature Search

To answer the research questions, relevant papers on log security were collected from digital libraries such as IEEE, Elsevier, SpringerLink, ACM, and other resources. Search terms included "Logs Security," "Secure Audit Log Management," and "Log Immutability."

#### Evaluation Metrics

Secure logging schemes can be evaluated using both quantitative and qualitative approaches. This research focused on the features and functions provided by available schemes, comparing them with the security parameters in Table 2.

#### Related Work

Various solutions for log management are available, including GFI EventsManager, Syslog-ng, ManageEngine Log Analyzer, LOGalyze, and Splunk. These solutions store and analyze logs but often render full control to system administrators, potentially compromising log integrity. To address this, researchers have proposed symmetric and asymmetric encryption schemes, such as Waters et al. (2004), Yavuz et al. (2012a), and Schneier & Kelsey (1998).

Other approaches include hardware-based logging schemes (Jaquette et al.), tamper-proof storage using Trusted Platform Module 2.0 (Sinha et al., 2014), and file system-based logging schemes (Ko et al., 2011). Distributed ledger technology (Cucurull & Puiggal√≠, 2016) and blockchain (Sutton & Samavi, 2017) have also been proposed for log immutability and privacy.

#### Taxonomy

A taxonomy was developed to highlight the major components of the audit log management research domain, including security requirements, securing techniques, storage methods, and semantics. Security requirements are further divided into basic and extended requirements.

#### Comparison of Selected Schemes

Selected logging security schemes were explored and compared with the security parameters in Table 2. While each scheme provides specific features, no single scheme fulfills all the required features. A tabular comparison of this study is presented in Table 4.

### Conclusion and Future Directions

Audit log management is a complex task that has been under research for a long time. This study explored various audit log management approaches to identify basic and extended requirements, as well as threats and vulnerabilities. Parameters for securing audit logs and providing countermeasures against threats were extracted from published research articles.

Future research should focus on developing a comprehensive log management system that addresses all the identified requirements and vulnerabilities, ensuring the integrity, immutability, and semantics of logs.
