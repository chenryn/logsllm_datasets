React version: 17.0.2
## Steps To Reproduce
  1. Use NVDA in Firefox to Navigate through the first code example provided below. (use down arrow keystrokes to navigate the page)
  2. Notice how the graphic elements get announced as clickable.
Link to code example:
        Basic HTML5 document
From the above minimal example, you can see how events delegated to the root
cause NVDA to announce the element as clickable.
If we take this other example:
        Basic HTML5 document
The  element will not be read as clickable.
Putting handlers on the root is a loss of semantics, and causes the intention
of handlers to be no longer communicated well to the assistive technology.
## The current behaviour
NVDA reads clickable due to event delegation performed at the root level.
## The expected behaviour
NVDA should not read clickable.  
Could react provide a way for authors to arbitrarily delegate events to the
document node?
