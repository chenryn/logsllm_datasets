User: How to securely connect to a Linux server remotely through the SSH protocol? Please provide specific steps.
Assistant: SSH (Secure Shell) is an encrypted remote login protocol, and many servers and network devices support the SSH protocol. The following are the steps to remotely connect to the server using the SSH protocol in the Linux system: 1. Open a terminal window and enter the following command to connect to the target server: ssh username@IP_address Among them, username is the username of the target server, and IP_address is the IP of the target server address. 2. If it is the first time to connect to the target server, a message similar to the following will appear: The authenticity of host 'IP_address (IP_address)' can't be established. ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:<fingerprint>. Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? Enter yes according to the prompt to continue connecting. You will then be prompted for a password. 3. After entering the password, you will successfully log in to the target server. 4. If you need to use a non-standard SSH port for connection, add the -p option after the ssh command, for example: ssh -p port username@IP_address where port is the SSH port number of the target server. 5. If you still need to use the SSH key to connect, you need to create an SSH key pair on the local computer first, and upload the public key to the target server. The specific steps are as follows: - Open a terminal window on the local computer, and enter the following command to generate an SSH key pair: ssh-keygen -t rsa At this point, you will be prompted to enter information such as the key storage path and password. You can press Enter to use the default, or enter custom information. - After the key pair is generated, you can view the saved key information on the local computer, for example: cd ~/.ssh ls You can see files including id_rsa and id_rsa.pub, where id_rsa is the private key and id_rsa.pub is the public key key. - Next you need to upload the public key to the target server. The public key can be copied into the authorized_keys file of the target server using the following command: ssh-copy-id username@IP_address where username is the username of the target server and IP_address is the IP address of the target server. After entering this command, you need to enter the password of the target server. 6. After successfully uploading the public key, you can use the SSH key to connect. Use the following command on the local computer to connect to the target server: ssh -i path/to/private_key username@IP_address Wherein, path/to/private_key is the storage path of the private key on the local computer.
