User: I started learning python on a PC, by installing Python 3, and so when I switched to mac I thought "Look at that, you can just type idle in the terminal and there's Python 2, let me just use that," not wanting to have to deal with two versions on the same machine. However, I read that it's recommended to install a newer version of Python and not to mess up with the built-in install.
Is it a bad practice to use the built-in version? For the matter, I'm not a heavy programmer, just like to play with Python every now and then. The only extra module I've installed was Pillow.
Assistant: You can use the built-in Python, there's nothing "bad" about it.  If someday you run into some limitation (unlikely), you can always switch then.
