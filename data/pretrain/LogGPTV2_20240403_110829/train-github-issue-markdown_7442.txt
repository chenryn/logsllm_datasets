Certainly! Hereâ€™s a more polished and professional version of your text:

I have a DataFrame that appears as follows, with the second column missing:

When I attempt to select the maximum date in each row, I receive all NaN values in return:

However, if the DataFrame's data type is `float64`, the selection works as expected.
