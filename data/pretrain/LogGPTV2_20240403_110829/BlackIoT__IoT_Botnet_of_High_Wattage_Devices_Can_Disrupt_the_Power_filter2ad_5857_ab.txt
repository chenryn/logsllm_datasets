the lines are limited by their terminating buses’ voltages.
The voltages at the buses are controlled by maintaining
the level of the reactive power (𝑄) supply. Voltage in-
stability or as it is called voltage collapse occurs when
the generated reactive power becomes inadequate. This
is mainly due to changes in system conﬁgurations due to
line failures, increase in active or reactive power demand,
or loss of generators. Voltage collapse should be stud-
ied using 𝑉 -𝑄 (characterizing the relationship between
the voltage at the terminating bus of a line to the reactive
power ﬂow) and 𝑃 -𝑉 (characterizing the relationship be-
tween the voltage at the terminating bus of a line to the
active power ﬂow) analysis which is beyond the scope of
this paper, but for more details see [62, Chapter 7].
Voltage collapse results in the infeasibility of the power
ﬂow equations. Hence, it can be detected when the power
ﬂow solver fails to ﬁnd a solution to the power ﬂow equa-
tion (usually after an initial change in the system).
In
such scenarios, the grid operator is forced to perform load
shedding (i.e., outage in part of the grid) in order to re-
cover the system from a voltage collapse and make the
power ﬂow equations feasible again. Hence, even fail-
ures in a few lines or an increase in the active/reactive
power demands may result in large scale outages around
the grid due to voltage collapse.

respond to the frequency. When the demand gets greater
than the supply, the rotating speeds of the turbine gen-
erators’ rotors decelerate, and the kinetic energy of the
rotors are released into the system in response to the ex-
tra demand. Correspondingly, this causes a drop in the
system’s frequency. This behavior of turbine generators
corresponds to Newton’s ﬁrst law of motion and is calcu-
lated by the inertia of the generator. Similarly, the supply
being greater than the demand results in acceleration of
the generators’ rotors and a rise in the system’s frequency.
This decrease/increase in the frequency of the sys-
tem cannot be tolerated for a long time since frequencies
lower than the nominal value severely damage the gener-
ators. If the frequency goes above or below a threshold
value, protection relays turn oﬀ or disconnect the gen-
erators completely (see Fig. 4 for normal and abnormal
frequency ranges in North America). Hence, within sec-
onds of the ﬁrst signs of decrease in the frequency, the
primary controller activates and increases the mechani-
cal input which increases the speed of the generator’s ro-
tor and correspondingly the frequency of the system [26].
Despite stability of the system’s frequency after the
primary controller’s response, it may not return to its
nominal frequency (mainly due to the generators gener-
ating more than their nominal value). Hence, the sec-
ondary controller starts within minutes to restore the sys-
tem’s frequency. The secondary controller modiﬁes the
active power set points and deploys available extra gen-
erators and controllable demands to restore the nominal
frequency and permanently stabilizes the system.
2.3 Power Flows
The equality of supply and demand is a necessary con-
dition for the stable operation of the grid, but it is far from
being suﬃcient. In order to deliver power from genera-
tors to loads, the electric power should be transmitted by
the transmission lines. The power transmitted on each
line in known as the power ﬂow on that line.
Unlike routing in computer networks, power ﬂows are

3 Attacking the Grid Using an IoT Botnet
In this section, we reveal attack mechanisms that can
utilize an IoT botnet of high wattage devices to launch a
large-scale coordinated attack on the power grid.
3.1 Threat Model
We assume that an adversary has already gained access
to an IoT botnet of many high wattage smart appliances
(listed in Table 1) within a city, a country, or a continent.
Since most of the IoT devices are controlled using mo-
bile phone applications, access to users’ mobile phones
or corresponding applications can also be used to control
these devices [28]. This access can potentially allow the
adversary to increase or decrease the demand in diﬀerent
locations remotely and synchronously. The adversary’s
power to manipulate the demand can also be translated
into watts (𝑊 ) using the numbers in Table 1 and based
on the type and the number of devices to which it has
access.
For example, if we consider only the houses with smart
thermostats in 2018 as shown in Fig. 5 and assuming that
each thermostat only controls two 1𝑘𝑊 air condition-
ers, an attacker can potentially control 35𝐺𝑊 of electric
power2–even a fraction of which is a signiﬁcant amount.
Recall that in the case of the Mirai botnet, the attackers
could get access to about 600 thousand devices within a
few months [12].
The 35𝐺𝑊 is computed by only considering the ther-
mostats connected to a few air conditioners. By con-
sidering all the smart air conditioners as well as other
high wattage appliances such as water heaters, this value
would be much higher. Moreover, this amount will grow
in the future as the trend shows in Fig. 5.
We call
the attacks under this threat model
the
Manipulation of the demand via IoT (MadIoT) attacks.
In the next subsection, we provide the details of various
types of attacks that can be performed by an adversary.
3.2 MadIoT Attack Variations
MadIoT attacks can disrupt the normal operation of the
power grid in many ways. Here, we present the most im-
2For the sake of comparison, this amount is equal to 7% of the entire
U.S. 2017 Winter peak demand (about 500𝐺𝑊 ) [10].
portant and direct ways that such attacks can cause dam-
age to the grid (summarized in Table 2):
1. Signiﬁcant frequency drop/rise: As brieﬂy described
in Section 2, the normal operation of the power grid relies
on the persistent balance between the supply and demand.
Thus, an adversary’s approach could be to disrupt this
balance using an IoT botnet. An adversary can leverage
an IoT botnet of high-wattage devices and synchronously
switch on all the compromised devices. If the resulting
sudden increase in the demand is greater than a thresh-
old, which depends on the inertia of the system, it can
cause the system’s frequency to drop signiﬁcantly before
the primary controllers can react. This consequently may
result in the activation of the generators’ protective relays
and loss of generators, and ﬁnally a blackout. Sudden de-
crease in the demand may also result in the same eﬀect
but this time by causing a sudden rise in the frequency.
An adversary can further increase its success by strate-
gic selection of the timing of an attack using the online
data available via the websites of Independent System
Operators (ISOs)3 (e.g., daily fuel mix and live updates
of the demand values.) For example, we know that as the
share of renewable resources in the power generation in-
creases, the inertia of the system decreases. Therefore,
an attack that is coordinated with the time that renewable
penetration is highest, is more eﬀective in causing large
changes in the frequency. Similarly, an attack during the
peak hours can result in a slow yet persistent frequency
drop in the system. Such an attack may exhaust the con-
troller reserves and force the system operator to perform
load shedding. This may result in power outages in sev-
eral parts of the system if the situation is handled well
by the operator, or in a large-scale blackout if it is mis-
handled and the system’s frequency keeps dropping. Ac-
cording to the European Network of Transmission Sys-
tem Operators for Electricity (ENTSOE) guidelines, if
the frequency of the European grid goes below 47.5𝐻 𝑧
or above 51.5𝐻 𝑧, a blackout can hardly be avoided [25].
2. Disrupting a black start: Once there is a blackout,
the grid operator needs to restart the system as soon as
possible. This process is called a black start. Since the
demand is unknown at the time of a black start, restarting
the whole grid at the same time may result in frequency
instability and system failure again. Hence, in a black
start, the operator divides the system into smaller islands
and tries to restart the grid in each island separately. The
islands are then connected to increase the reliability of
the system.
Since the grid is partitioned into smaller islands at
3The system operators are given diﬀerent names in diﬀerent coun-
tries and continents, but here for the sake of simplicity, we refer to all
of them as ISOs.

the time of a black start, the inertia of each part is low
and therefore the system is very vulnerable to demand
changes. Thus, an adversary can signiﬁcantly hinder the
black start process by suddenly increasing the demand us-
ing the IoT botnet once an island is up. This can cause a
large frequency disturbance in each island and cause the
grid to return to the blackout state.
3. Line failures and cascades: Recall from Section 2.3
that the power ﬂows in power grids are determined by
the Kirchhoﬀ’s laws. Therefore, most of the time, the
grid operator does not have any control over the power
ﬂows from generators to loads. Once an adversary causes
a sudden increase in the loads all around the grid, assum-
ing that the frequency drop is not signiﬁcant, the extra
demand is satisﬁed by the primary controller. Since the
power ﬂows are not controlled by the grid operator at this
stage, this may result in line overloads and consequent
lines tripping.
After initial lines tripping or failures, the power ﬂows
carried by these lines are redistributed to other lines based
on Kirchhoﬀ’s laws. Therefore, the initial line failures
may subsequently result in further line failures or, as it is
called, a cascading failure [54]. These failures may even-
tually result in the separation of the system into smaller
unbalanced islands and a large-scale blackout.
Moreover, failure in a few lines accompanied by an in-
crease in the power demand may result in a voltage col-
lapse (recall from Section 2.4) which consequently would
force the grid operator to perform load shedding. Hence,
in some steps during the cascade, there are more outages
due to load shedding.
An adversary may also start cascading line failures by
redistributing the loads in the system by increasing the
demand in a few locations and decreasing the demand in
others in order to keep the total demand constant. This
redistribution of the demand in the system may result in
line failures without causing any frequency disturbances.
The advantage of this attack is that it may have the same
eﬀect without attracting a lot of attention from the grid
operator. It can be considered to be a stealthier version
of the demand increase only attack.
4. Failures in the tie-lines: Tie-lines between the ISOs
are among the most important lines within an intercon-
nection. These tie-lines are usually used for carrying
large amounts of power as part of an exchange program
between two ISOs. Failure in one of these lines may re-
sult in a huge power deﬁcit (usually more than 1𝐺𝑊 ) in
the receiving ISO and most likely a blackout due to the
subsequent frequency disturbances or a large-scale out-
age due to load shedding by the grid operator.
Due to their importance, the tie-lines can be the tar-
get of an adversary. An adversary can observe the actual
power ﬂows on the tie-lines through ISOs’ websites, and
target the one that is carrying power ﬂow near its capac-
ity. In order to overload that line, all the adversary needs
to do is to turn on the high wattage IoT devices in the
area at the importing end of the line and turn oﬀ the ones
at the exporting end (using the IP addresses of the de-
vices).4 This can overload the tie-line and cause it to trip
by triggering its protective relay.
5. Increasing the operating cost: When the demand
goes above the predicted value, the ISO needs to purchase
additional electric power from ancillary services (i.e., re-
serve generators). These reserve generators usually have
a higher price than the generators committed as part of
the day ahead planning. Thus, using the reserve genera-
tors can signiﬁcantly increase the power generation cost
for the grid operator but at the same time be proﬁtable for
the utility that operates the reserve generator.
Hence, the goal of an adversary’s attack may be to ben-
eﬁt a particular utility in the electricity market rather than
to damage the infrastructure. The adversary can achieve
this goal by slowly increasing the demand (e.g., switch-
ing on a few devices at a time) at a particular time of the
day and in a certain location. Moreover, it may reach out
4A sudden increase in the demand, only at the importing end of the
tie-line, may also result in its overload. This is due to the fact that once
there is an imbalance between the supply and demand, all the generators
within an interconnection (whether inside or outside of the particular
ISO) respond to the imbalance which consequently results in an increase
in the power ﬂow on the tie-line.

Overall, the above attacks demonstrate that an adver-
sary as described in Section 3.1 has tremendous power to
manipulate the operation of the grid in many ways which
were not possible a few years ago in the absence of IoT
devices.
3.3 Properties and Defensive Challenges
The MadIoT attacks have unique properties that make
them very eﬀective and at the same time very hard to de-
fend against. In this subsection, we brieﬂy describe some
of these properties.
First, the sources of the MadIoT attacks are very hard
to detect and disconnect by the grid operator. The main
reason is that the security breach is in the IoT devices, yet
the attack is on the power grid. The grid operator cannot
easily detect which houses are aﬀected since it only sees
the aggregation of the distributed changes in the demand
around the grid. At the same time, the attack does not
noticeably aﬀect the performance of the IoT devices, es-
pecially if the smart thermostat is attacked. Moreover,
the attack may not be noticeable by the households since
the changes are temporary and can be considered as part
of the automatic temperature control.
Second, the MadIoT attacks are easy to repeat. An ad-
versary can easily repeat an attack at diﬀerent times of
the day and diﬀerent days to ﬁnd a time when the attack
is the most eﬀective. Moreover, this repeatability allows
an adversary to cause a persistent blackout in the power
grid by disrupting the black start process as described in
the previous subsection.
Third, the MadIoT attacks are black-box. An adversary
does not need to know the underlying topology or the de-
tailed operational properties of the grid, albeit it can use
the high-level information available on the ISOs’ web-
sites to improve the timing of its attack. It can also use
the repeatability of these attacks and general properties
of the power grids to achieve and perform a successful
attack.
Finally, power grids are not prepared to defend against
the MadIoT attacks, since abrupt changes in the demand
are not part of the contingency list that grid operators are
prepared for. As mentioned in Section 2, power grids
are required to operate normally after a failure in a single
