ABSTRACT
The success of Skype has inspired a generation of peer-to-
peer-based solutions for satisfactory real-time multimedia
services over the Internet. However, fundamental questions,
such as whether VoIP services like Skype are good enough in
terms of user satisfaction, have not been formally addressed.
One of the major challenges lies in the lack of an easily
accessible and objective index to quantify the degree of user
satisfaction.
In this work, we propose a model, geared to Skype, but
generalizable to other VoIP services, to quantify VoIP user
satisfaction based on a rigorous analysis of the call dura-
tion from actual Skype traces. The User Satisfaction Index
(USI) derived from the model is unique in that 1) it is com-
posed by objective source- and network-level metrics, such
as the bit rate, bit rate jitter, and round-trip time, 2) unlike
speech quality measures based on voice signals, such as the
PESQ model standardized by ITU-T, the metrics are eas-
ily accessible and computable for real-time adaptation, and
3) the model development only requires network measure-
ments, i.e., no user surveys or voice signals are necessary.
Our model is validated by an independent set of metrics
that quantiﬁes the degree of user interaction from the ac-
tual traces.

INTRODUCTION
There are over 200 million Skype downloads and approxi-
mately 85 million users worldwide. The user base is growing
at more than 100, 000 a day, and there are 3.5 to 4 million
active users at any one time12. The phenomenal growth
of Skype has not only inspired a generation of application-
level solutions for satisfactory real-time multimedia services
over the Internet, but also stunned the market observers
worldwide with the recent US$ 4.1 billion deal with eBay3.
Network engineers and market observers study Skype for
diﬀerent reasons. The former seek ways to enhance user sat-
isfaction, while the latter collect information to reﬁne their
predictions of the growth of the user base. They both, how-
ever, need the answer to a fundamental question: Is Skype
providing a good enough voice phone service to the users, or
is there still room for improvement?
To date, there has not been a formal study that quanti-
ﬁes the level of user satisfaction with the Skype voice phone
service. The diﬃculties lie in 1) the peer-to-peer nature
of Skype, which makes it diﬃcult to capture a substantial
amount of traﬃc for analysis; and 2) existing approaches to
studying user satisfaction rely on speech-signal-level infor-
mation that is not available to parties other than the call
participants. Furthermore, studies that evaluate the percep-
tual quality of audio are mostly signal-distortion-based [9–
11]. This approach has two drawbacks: 1) it usually re-
quires access to signals from both ends, the original and the
degraded signals, which is not practical in VoIP applications;
2) it cannot take account of factors other than speech sig-
nal degradation, e.g., variable listening levels, sidetone/talk
echo, and conversational delay.
We propose an objective, perceptual index for measuring
Skype user satisfaction. The model, called the User Satisfac-
tion Index (USI), is based on a rigorous analysis of the call
duration and source- and network-level QoS metrics. The
speciﬁc model presented in this paper is geared to Skype,

but the methodology is generalizable to other VoIP and in-
teractive real-time multimedia services. Our model is unique
in that the parameters used to construct the index are easy
to access. The required information can be obtained by pas-
sive measurement and ping-like probing. The parameters
are also easy to compute, as only ﬁrst- and second-moment
statistics of the packet counting process are needed. There
is no need to consider voice signals. Therefore, user satis-
faction can be assessed online. This will enable any QoS-
sensitive application to adapt in real time its source rate,
data path, or relay node for optimal user satisfaction.
To validate the index, we compare the proposed USI with
an independent set of metrics that quantify the degree of
voice interactivity from actual Skype sessions. The basic
assumption is that the more smoothly users interact, the
more satisﬁed they will be. The level of user interaction is
deﬁned by the responsiveness, response delay, and talk burst
length. Speech activity is estimated by a wavelet-based algo-
rithm [6] from packet size processes. The strong correlation
observed between the interactivity of user conversations and
USI supports the representativeness of the USI.
By deriving the objective, perceptual index, we are able to
quantify the relative impact of the bit rate, the compound of
delay jitter and packet loss, and network latency on Skype
call duration. The importance of these three factors is ap-
proximately 46%:53%:1% respectively. The delay jitter and
loss rate are known to be critical to the perception of real-
time applications. To our surprise, network latency has rel-
atively little eﬀect, but the source rate is almost as critical
as the compound of the delay jitter and packet loss. We be-
lieve these discoveries indicate that adaptations for a stable,
higher bandwidth channel are likely the most eﬀective way
to increase user satisfaction in Skype. The selection of re-
lay nodes based on network delay optimization, a technique
often used to ﬁnd a quality detour by peer-to-peer overlay
multimedia applications, is less likely to make a signiﬁcant
diﬀerence for Skype in terms of user satisfaction.
Our contribution is three-fold: 1) We devise an objective
and perceptual user satisfaction index in which the param-
eters are all easily measurable and computable online; 2)
we validate the index with an independent set of metrics
for voice interactivity derived from user conversation pat-
terns; and 3) we quantify the inﬂuence of the bit rate, jitter
and loss, and delay on call duration, which provides hints
about the priority of the metrics to tune for optimal user
satisfaction with Skype.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 describes related works. We discuss the measurement
methodology and summarize our traces in Section 3.
In
Section 4, we derive the USI by analyzing Skype VoIP ses-
sions, especially the relationship between call duration and
source-/network-level conditions. In Section 5, we validate
the USI with an independent set metrics based on speech
interactivity. Finally, Section 6 draws our conclusion.
2. RELATED WORK
Objective methods for assessing speech quality can be
classiﬁed into two types: referenced and unreferenced. Ref-
erenced methods [9, 11] measure distortion between original
and degraded speech signals and map the distortion values
to mean opinion scores (MOS). However, there are two prob-
lems with such model: 1) both the original and the degraded
signals must be available, and 2) it is diﬃcult to synchro-

the response variable used in the model development
nize the two signals. Unreferenced models [10], on the other
hand, do not have the above problems, as only the degraded
signal is required. The unreferenced models, however, do not
capture human perception as well as the referenced models.
The USI model and the measures of speech quality al-
though aim similarly at providing objective metrics to quan-
tify user perception, however, they have a number of sub-
stantial diﬀerences: 1) the USI model is based on call du-
ration, rather than speech quality; therefore, factors other
than speech quality, such as listening volume and conver-
sational delay [11], can also be captured by USI; and 2)
rather than relying on subjective surveys, the USI model
is based on passive measurement, so it can capture subcon-
scious reactions that listeners are even unaware of. Table 1
summarizes the major diﬀerences.
3. TRACE COLLECTION
In this section, we describe the collection of Skype VoIP
sessions and their network parameters. We ﬁrst present the
network setup and ﬁltering method used in the traﬃc cap-
ture stage. The algorithm for extracting VoIP sessions from
packet traces is then introduced, followed by the strategy
to sample path characteristics. Finally, we summarize the
collected VoIP sessions.
3.1 Network Setup
Because of the peer-to-peer nature of Skype, no one net-
work node can see traﬃc between any two Skype hosts in
the world. However, it is still possible to gather Skype traﬃc
related to a particular site. To do so, we set up a packet snif-
fer that monitors all traﬃc entering and leaving a campus
network, as shown in Fig. 1. The sniﬀer is a FreeBSD 5.2
machine equipped with dual Intel Xeon 3.2G processors and
one gigabyte memory. As noted in [12], two Skype nodes
can communicate via a relay node if they have diﬃculties
establishing sessions. Also, a powerful Skype node is likely
to be used as the relay node of VoIP sessions if it has been
up for a suﬃcient length of time. Therefore we also set up
a powerful Linux machine to elicit more relay traﬃc during
the course of trace collection.
3.2 Capturing Skype Trafﬁc
Given the huge amount of monitored traﬃc and the low
proportion of Skype traﬃc, we use two-phase ﬁltering to
identify Skype VoIP sessions. In the ﬁrst stage, we ﬁlter and
store possible Skype traﬃc on the disk. Then in the second
stage, we apply an oﬀ-line identiﬁcation algorithm on the
captured packet traces to extract actual Skype sessions.
To detect possible Skype traﬃc in real time, we leverage
some known properties of Skype clients [1, 12]. First of all,
Skype does not use any well-known port number, which is

lection
one of the diﬃculties in distinguishing Skype traﬃc from
that of other applications. Instead, it uses a dynamic port
number in most communications, which we call the “Skype
port” hereafter. Skype uses this port to send all outgoing
UDP packets and accept incoming TCP connections and
UDP packets. The port is chosen randomly when the appli-
cation is installed and can be conﬁgured by users. Secondly,
in the login process, Skype submits HTTP requests to a
well-known server, ui.skype.com. If the login is successful,
Skype contacts one or more super nodes listed in its host
cache by sending UDP packets through its Skype port.
Based on the above knowledge, we use a heuristic to detect
Skype hosts and their Skype ports. The heuristic works as
follows. For each HTTP request sent to ui.skype.com, we
treat the sender as a Skype host and guess its Skype port
by inspecting the port numbers of outgoing UDP packets
sent within the next 10 seconds. The port number used
most frequently is chosen as the Skype port of that host.
Once a Skype host has been identiﬁed, all peers that have
bi-directional communication with the Skype port on that
the host are also classiﬁed as Skype hosts. With such a
heuristic, we maintained a table of identiﬁed Skype hosts
and their respective Skype ports, and recorded all traﬃc
sent from or to these (host, port) pairs. The heuristic is not
perfect because it also records non-voice-packets and may
collect traﬃc from other applications by mistake. Despite
the occasional false positives, it does reduce the number of
packets we need to capture to only 1–2% of the number of
observed packets in our environment. As such, it is a simple
ﬁltering method that eﬀectively ﬁlters out most unwanted
traﬃc and reduces the overhead of oﬀ-line processing.
3.3 Identiﬁcation of VoIP Sessions
Having captured packet traces containing possible Skype
traﬃc, we proceed to extract true VoIP sessions. We de-
ﬁne a “ﬂow” as a succession of packets with the same ﬁve-
tuple (source and destination IP address, source and des-
tination port numbers, and protocol number). We deter-
mine whether a ﬂow is active or not by its moving average
packet rate. A ﬂow is deemed active if its rate is higher than
a threshold 15 pkt/sec, and considered inactive otherwise.
The average packet rate is computed using an exponential
weighted moving average (EWMA) as follows:
Ai+1 = (1 − α)Ai + αIi,
where Ii represents the average packet rate of the i-th second
of the ﬂow and Ai is the average rate. The weight α is set
at 0.15 when the ﬂow is active and 0.75 when the ﬂow is
inactive. The diﬀerent weights used in diﬀerent states allow
the start of a ﬂow to be detected more quickly [12].
the following criteria are met:
An active ﬂow is regarded as a valid VoIP session if all
• The ﬂow’s duration is longer than 10 seconds.
• The average packet rate is within a reasonable range,
(10, 100) pkt/sec.
• The average packet size is within (30, 300) bytes. Also,
the EWMA of the packet size process (with α = 0.15)
must be within (35, 500) bytes all the time.
After VoIP sessions have been identiﬁed, each pair of ses-
sions is checked to see if it can form a relayed session, i.e.,
these two ﬂows are used to convey the same set of VoIP
packets with the relay node in our campus network. We
merge a pair of ﬂows into a relayed session if the following
conditions are met: 1) the ﬂows’ start and ﬁnish time are
close to each other with errors less than 30 seconds; 2) the
ratio of their average packet rates is smaller than 1.5; and 3)
their packet arrival processes are positively correlated with
a coeﬃcient higher than 0.5.
3.4 Measurement of Path Characteristics
As voice packets may experience delay or loss while trans-
mitting over the network, the path characteristics would un-
doubtedly aﬀect speech quality. However, we cannot deduce
round-trip times (RTT) and their jitters simply from packet
traces because Skype voice packets are encrypted and most
of them are conveyed by UDP. Therefore, We send out probe
packets to measure paths’ round-trip times while captur-
ing Skype traﬃc.
In order to minimize the possible dis-
turbance caused by active measurement, probes are sent in
batches of 20 with exponential intervals of mean 1 second.
Probe batches are sent at two-minute intervals for each ac-
tive ﬂow. While “ping” tasks are usually achieved by ICMP
packets, many routers nowadays discard such packets to re-
duce load and prevent attacks. Fortunately, we ﬁnd that,
certain Skype hosts respond to traceroute probes sent to
their Skype ports. Thus, to increase the yield rate of RTT
samples, traceroute-like probes, which are based on UDP,
are also used in addition to ICMP probes.
3.5 Trace Summary
The trace collection took place over two months in late
2005. We obtained 634 VoIP sessions, of which 462 sessions
were usable as they had more than ﬁve RTT samples. Of
the 462 sessions, 253 were directly-established and 209 were
relayed. A summary of the collected sessions is listed in Ta-
ble 2. One can see from the table that median of the relayed
session durations is signiﬁcantly shorter than that of the di-
rect sessions, as their 95% conﬁdence bands do not overlap.
We believe the discrepancy could be explained by various
factors, such as larger RTTs or lower bit rates. The rela-
tionship between these factors and the session/call duration
is investigated in detail in the next section.
4. ANALYSIS OF CALL DURATION
In this section, based on a statistical analysis, we posit
that call duration is signiﬁcantly correlated with QoS fac-
tors, including the bit rate, network latency, network delay

variations, and packet loss. We then develop a model to de-
scribe the relationship between call duration and QoS fac-
tors. Assuming that call duration implies the conversation
quality users perceive, we propose an objective index, the
User Satisfaction Index (USI) to quantify the level of user
satisfaction. Later, in Section 5, we will validate the USI
by voice interactivity measures inferred from user conserva-
tions, where both measures strongly support each other.
4.1 Survival Analysis
In our trace (shown in Table 2), 6 out of 462 calls were
censored, i.e., only a portion of the calls was observed by our
monitor. This was due to accidental disk or network out-
age during the trace period. Censored observations should
be also used because longer sessions are more likely to be
censored than shorter session. Simply disregarding them
will lead to underestimation. Additionally, while regression
analysis is a powerful technique for investigating relation-
ships among variables, the most commonly used linear re-
gression is not appropriate for modeling call duration be-
cause the assumption of normal errors with equal variance
is violated. However, with proper transformation, the re-
lationships of session time and predictors can be described
well by the Cox Proportional Hazards model [3] in survival
analysis. For the sake of censoring and the Cox regression
model, we adopt methodologies as well as terminology in
survival analysis in this paper.
4.2 Effect of Source Rate
Skype uses a wideband codec that adapts to the network
environment by adjusting the bandwidth used. It is gener-
ally believed that Skype uses the iSAC codec provided by
Global IP Sound. According to the white paper of iSAC4, it
automatically adjusts the transmission rate from a low of 10
Kbps to a high of 32 Kbps. However, most of the sessions
in our traces used 20–64 Kbps. A higher source rate means
that more quality sound samples are sent at shorter inter-
vals so that the receiver gets better voice quality. Therefore,
we expect that users’ conversation time will be aﬀected, to
some extent, by the source rate chosen by Skype.
