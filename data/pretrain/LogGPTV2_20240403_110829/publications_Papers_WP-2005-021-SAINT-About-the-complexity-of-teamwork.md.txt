Important questions that can be made relative to the
processes illustrated are: “what is the complexity of the
processes?”, “can the eligibility referral process be
designed in a simpler way?”, and “what areas or regions
of the process are more complex and therefore more prone
to errors?”
Other important questions are to inquire about the
complexity of the two processes. Is the process eligibility
referral process more complex that the head ultrasound
pathway? Are they both equally complex? Or is the
second process more complex that the first one.
Complexity measurement gives a method to answer to
these questions.
3. Conclusions
The complexity of collaborative and teamwork
processes is intuitively connected to effects such as
readability, effort, testability, reliability and
maintainability of processes. The complexity of a process
is also strongly associated with the degree of difficulty a
user has to understand and use a process. Therefore, it is
important to develop measures to automatically identify
complex collaborative and teamwork processes.
Afterwards, these processes can be reengineered to reduce
the complexity of related activities.
In this paper we discuss fundamental issues related to
process complexity. Our objective is to provide the first
steps for the development of models and tools for the
computation of processes’ complexity.
