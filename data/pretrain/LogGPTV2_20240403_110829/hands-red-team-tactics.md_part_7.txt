### Experience in Advanced Penetration Testing and Red Teaming

In the rapidly evolving field of cybersecurity, topics such as post-exploitation, lateral movement, and data exfiltration are constantly advancing. New tools and techniques are being released almost daily. As a penetration tester, one must continually adapt to these changes. The next level for a penetration tester is to become a Red Teamer. While a penetration tester starts with ethical hacking and progresses to more advanced testing, cybercriminals do not limit themselves to generic penetration testing. They launch sophisticated attacks with harmful intent, leading to mass data breaches and cyber espionage.

To protect organizations, it is essential to understand the mindset of a cybercriminal. Simulating real cyber attacks helps us assess the potential damage and prepare defenses. This is the essence of "Red Teaming," which differs significantly from a standard penetration test. A successful red team exercise requires clear objectives, scope, scenarios, and **Rules of Engagement (RoE)**. These elements must be meticulously defined to simulate a real adversary and provide maximum value to the client and stakeholders.

### Chapter Overview

- Setting up Cobalt Strike

### Technical Requirements

- Oracle Java 1.7 or later
- Cobalt Strike (trial version lasts for 21 days)
- Microsoft Word
- Visual Basic

### Planning a Red-Team Exercise

A red-team exercise is more than just a penetration test; it is an adversary attack simulation that evaluates:
- The organization's ability to detect an attack
- The organization's capability to contain or restrict the attack after detection
- The protection of business-critical assets
- The effectiveness of the organization's incident response during an attack

Before planning a red-team exercise, it is crucial to understand the concept of the **Cyber Kill Chain (CKC)**.

### Cyber Kill Chain (CKC)

The kill chain is a military concept used to structure an attack into several phases. In cybersecurity, the **Cyber Kill Chain** represents the stages of an attack, with each step leading to the end goal of espionage, ransoming, or destruction. The CKC methodology includes the following phases:

#### Reconnaissance
This phase involves gathering as much information as possible about the target. Adversaries may use various methods, including:
- Scanning the organization's website for vulnerabilities
- Spear phishing and watering-hole attacks
- Dumpster diving for credentials and access keys
- Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)

#### Weaponization
In this phase, the malware is prepared for delivery. The type of malware can range from simple payloads like meterpreter to complex custom-coded programs. Skilled adversaries often use custom malware to avoid detection. Even when using common tools like meterpreter, they obfuscate, encode, and encrypt the payload to bypass security mechanisms.

#### Delivery
The weaponized malware is delivered to the target organization via documents or PDFs with enticing titles. Once the document is opened and macros are enabled, the malware is executed.

#### Exploitation
The malware is executed on the target system, performing actions such as gaining access to FTP servers and distributing itself across the network.

#### Installation
The malware installs itself on the system to maintain persistence, either by writing to the disk or using in-memory techniques to evade detection.

#### Command and Control Server
The installed malware communicates with the **Command and Control (C2) Server**, allowing the adversary to issue commands and control the compromised system.

#### Actions
The final phase involves executing the adversary's plan, which could include data exfiltration, data destruction, or ransom setup.

### Planning Phases for a Red-Team Exercise

#### Objective and Goal
- What is the main objective of the exercise?
- What do you aim to achieve?

#### Rules of Engagement (RoE)
- Define the scope of the exercise.
- Establish the timeline for the exercise.
- Identify the stakeholders and responsible parties.
- Determine who will handle the incident response.

#### Scenario/Strategy
- How will you achieve the end goal?
- Where are you in the kill chain, and what type of attack will you use?
- Design the kill chain for the exercise.

#### Deliverables
- What are the expected results of the exercise?
- Did the defenders learn from the exercise?

### Introduction to Cobalt Strike

Cobalt Strike is a software tool for adversary simulations and red team operations. It replicates the tactics and techniques of advanced adversaries in a network, focusing on security operations and incident response. Cobalt Strike can be downloaded on a trial basis, valid for 21 days.

#### System Requirements
- 2 GHz+ processor
- 2 GB RAM
- 500MB+ available disk space
- Supported operating systems: Kali Linux 1.0, 2.0, Ubuntu Linux 12.04, 14.04
- Cobalt Strike client supports: Windows 7 and above, macOS X 10.10 and above, Kali Linux 1.0, 2.0, Ubuntu Linux 12.04, 14.04

### Setting Up Cobalt Strike

#### Running the Team Server
The team server is the main controller for the payloads used in Cobalt Strike. It logs all events and collects credentials discovered during post-exploitation. To start the team server, use the following command:
```bash
sudo ./teamserver 192.168.10.122 harry@123
```
Replace `192.168.10.122` with your IP address and `harry@123` with your password.

#### Connecting to the Team Server
To connect to the team server, use the following command:
```bash
java -jar cobaltstrike.jar
```
Provide the team server IP, port number (default is 50050), user, and password to establish the connection.

### Cobalt Strike Interface

The Cobalt Strike interface is divided into two sections:
- **Visualization Tab**: Displays sessions and targets visually.
- **Display Tab**: Interacts with Cobalt Strike features and sessions.

#### Toolbar
The toolbar provides quick access to common features:
- View credentials
- View downloaded files
- View keystrokes
- View screenshots
- Generate stageless executables or DLLs
- Set up Java Signed Applet attacks
- Generate malicious Microsoft Office macros
- Host files on Cobalt Strike's web server
- Manage hosted files and applications
- Visit the Cobalt Strike support page
- About Cobalt Strike

#### Connecting to Another Team Server
To connect to another team server, click the + sign to open the connect window. Previous connections are stored as profiles for easy reconnection.

By following these steps and understanding the concepts, you can effectively plan and execute a red-team exercise using Cobalt Strike.
