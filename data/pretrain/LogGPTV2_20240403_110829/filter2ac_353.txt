**ATT&CK ID:** T0891  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Hardcoded Credentials

Adversaries may exploit credentials that are hardcoded within software or firmware to gain unauthorized access and establish an interactive user session on a target asset. Examples of such hardcoded credentials can include:

- Default usernames and passwords for administrative accounts.
- API keys, tokens, or other authentication mechanisms embedded in the code.
- Pre-configured access credentials for databases, network devices, or other critical systems.

By leveraging these hardcoded credentials, attackers can bypass normal authentication processes, potentially gaining elevated privileges and persistent access to the system.
