User: I'm using the standard python (2.5.2) logging module, specifically the RotatingFileHandler, on a linux system.  My application supports both a command-line interface and a web-service interface.  I would like to have both write to the same log file.  However, when the log file gets rotated, the new file has 644 permissions and is owned by the web server user which prevents the command-line user from writing to it.  Can I specify that new log files should be group-writable in the logging configuration or during logging initialization?
I have looked into the mode setting (r/w/a), but it doesn't seem to support any file permissions.
Assistant: I think what described here is an anti-pattern - different processes should not write data into the same file.
And non of the solutions above worked for me, causing different permissions issues in different scenarios.
As a temp workaround I've added a random suffix into the log filename so each process will get a unique filename on a startup.
The proper way to solve this issue - have a centralized log handler (log server), e.g. rsyslog.
