User: When I execute jupyter notebook in my virtual environment in Arch Linux, the following error occurred.
Error executing Jupyter command 'notebook': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
My Python version is 3.6, and my Jupyter version is 4.3.0
How can I resolve this issue?
Assistant: Since both pip and pip3.6 was installed and 
pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall jupyter
was failing, so I used
pip3.6 install --upgrade --force-reinstall jupyter
and it worked for me.
Running jupyter notebook also worked after this installation.
