It appears that the `os.geteuid()` function, which is specific to Unix-like systems, is not available on Windows. This incompatibility is preventing Celery from starting. To resolve this issue, you can try one of the following solutions:

1. **Use a Cross-Platform Alternative:**
   Replace the use of `os.geteuid()` with a cross-platform equivalent. For example, you can check if the current user has administrative privileges using the `ctypes` library on Windows.

   ```python
   import os
   import sys
   import ctypes

   def is_admin():
       if sys.platform == 'win32':
           return ctypes.windll.shell32.IsUserAnAdmin() != 0
       else:
           return os.geteuid() == 0

   if is_admin():
       # Your code here
   ```

2. **Conditional Import:**
   Use a conditional import to handle the difference between Windows and Unix-like systems.

   ```python
   import os
   import sys

   if sys.platform == 'win32':
       def get_effective_user_id():
           # Implement a suitable alternative for Windows
           return 0  # or another appropriate value
   else:
       def get_effective_user_id():
           return os.geteuid()

   # Use get_effective_user_id() in your code
   if get_effective_user_id() == 0:
       # Your code here
   ```

3. **Patch the Code:**
   If you are using a third-party library (like Celery) that relies on `os.geteuid()`, you may need to patch the code or look for an updated version that includes better cross-platform support.

4. **Run on a Compatible System:**
   If possible, consider running your application on a Unix-like system (e.g., Linux, macOS) where `os.geteuid()` is natively supported.
