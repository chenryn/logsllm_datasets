Today, I successfully installed Rust and Cargo on my Raspberry Pi 4. However, when I attempted to run the build script for Deno, I encountered the following errors:

```
error: failed to add native library /tmp/cargo-installYJydOT/release/gn_out/obj/librusty_v8.a: file too small to be an archive
error: aborting due to previous error
error: could not compile `rusty_v8`
To learn more, run the command again with --verbose.
warning: build failed, waiting for other jobs to finish...
error: failed to add native library /tmp/cargo-installYJydOT/release/gn_out/obj/librusty_v8.a: file too small to be an archive
error: aborting due to previous error
error: failed to compile `deno v1.10.3`, intermediate artifacts can be found at `/tmp/cargo-installYJydOT`
Caused by:
  build failed
```

These errors indicate that the build process for the `rusty_v8` library failed because the file `/tmp/cargo-installYJydOT/release/gn_out/obj/librusty_v8.a` is too small to be a valid archive. As a result, the overall compilation of Deno version 1.10.3 also failed. 

For more detailed information, you can rerun the command with the `--verbose` flag. The intermediate build artifacts are located in the directory `/tmp/cargo-installYJydOT`.
