Rust and cargo installed nicely today on my raspberry pi 4, but running the
build script for deno resulted in
    error: failed to add native library /tmp/cargo-installYJydOT/release/gn_out/obj/librusty_v8.a: file too small to be an archive
    error: aborting due to previous error
    error: could not compile `rusty_v8`
    To learn more, run the command again with --verbose.
    warning: build failed, waiting for other jobs to finish...
