User: How to ensure the security of containerized applications and avoid being attacked and exploited?
Assistant: Here are a few suggestions: 1. Use the latest versions of containers and software: In order to overcome security vulnerabilities and issues, it is necessary to use the latest versions of containers and software. 2. Avoid out-of-date software if possible: Pre-existing vulnerabilities are addressed in the latest versions of the operating system and other software running between containers and container images. When updating software and containers, use the latest versions. 3. Use best practices for security settings: firewall settings, network protection, SSL certificate installation, operating system security updates, strong password settings and regular password changes, etc. 4. Software stack management: The more software in a container, the more prone to vulnerabilities. Avoid as much as possible running more software inside a container when no software is being used. 5. Application-level protection: In addition to hardening the general-purpose operating system before the container runs, the application-level security of the container image itself should also be strengthened. 6. Access control: Container security operations require access control to core functions, important data, and resources in order to verify and authenticate requests from different users, and only authorized users can obtain limited access rights. 7. Vulnerability scanning: Every time a container image is updated, the existing container image should be scanned to identify and evaluate vulnerabilities with the latest vulnerability database. 8. Regular updates: Update your own resources with the updated code base and deploy in the container environment. Newly announced bugfixes, security updates, and CVE vulnerabilities need to be dealt with in a timely manner. 9. Log and audit: Establish a log and audit system to collect information such as ports, configurations, environment variables, dependencies, and logs in the container, and use monitoring tools or SIEM to discover and handle abnormal behavior. 10. Strengthen segmentation and isolation: Different containers are isolated and segmented to ensure that the security of one container will not affect another container. You can use container management tools to implement container network isolation or use different IP addresses to build a cross-container platform intercommunication network.
