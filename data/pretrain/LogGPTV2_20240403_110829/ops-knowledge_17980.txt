Is it possible to use `pip wheel` to upload a binary wheel on Linux to a local devpi server? Or do I need to rely on a `setup.py` file and perform the upload from there? It seems inefficient to build the wheel without needing a `setup.py` (since it's handled behind the scenes) only to require one for the upload.

This leads me to wonder about C extensions. PyPI currently allows uploading platform-specific wheels only for Windows and macOS. However, creating wheels for these platforms is still beneficial, as it eliminates the need for users to compile the package during installation.

I am currently using the command `pip -v -v -v wheel numpy` (as an example), and I have both a `pip.conf` and a `.pypirc` file configured to point to our local devpi server.

In the end, I used `twine` for the upload. The `devpi` interfacing script is interesting, but I don't think we want it installed on all the machines where it would be needed.

Thank you!
