ABSTRACT
We employ user activity data from three highly popular gift-
ing applications on Facebook to study the evolution of user
activity on applications through the most commonly-used
growth mechanism, namely Application Requests. We ﬁnd
user activity graphs diﬀer from friendship graphs in large
part due to the inherent directionality of user activity, and
node transience. Our results show that, unlike degree distri-
butions in friendship graphs, activity graphs exhibit strong
asymmetry in in- and out-degree distributions, and that out-
degrees are not accurately described by currently known
parametric distributions. As such, user activity graphs can-
not be simulated through existing intent- and feature-driven
algorithms that can model friendship graphs.
We present a novel probabilistic growth model for user ac-
tivity on the gifting genre of social applications. Our model
decouples in- and out-degrees based on their distinct na-
ture exhibited by our empirical data. We use the insight
that regardless of increasing, declining or stable user activ-
ity, gifting application user activity exhibits the same graph
structure. Our model produces synthetic graphs that con-
sist of disconnected components with low clustering of nodes,
and exhibit degree structures very similar to our real activ-
ity data. We discuss the beneﬁts and shortfalls of our model
and its applicability to other types of OSN-based applica-
tions, such as social games. To the best of our knowledge
this study is the ﬁrst to explore and model user activity
growth processes on OSN-based applications.

INTRODUCTION
Over the last ﬁve years, Facebook has become the most
widely used Online Social Network (OSN) with a user base
of over 950 million, and through its Developer Platform,
Facebook supports a rich social application eco-system that
has become a $6+ billion industry as of 2012. This growing
importance of OSNs has spurred massive academic interest
in OSNs, resulting in research that has focused on studying
friendship graphs [15, 2, 23, 1]. Meanwhile, considerably
less is known about user activity on social networks, even
though researchers have argued the greater importance of
studying user activity over simple friendship formation [22,
7, 29, 24, 25, 21]. This lack of research on user activity
is due to privacy issues related to sharing of user activity
data [12], which have resulted in lack of availability of such
data for research purposes.
OSN friendship graphs diﬀer signiﬁcantly from user activ-
ity graphs (UAGs). We know that while friendship graphs
consist of static friendship relations that rarely change be-
tween user pairs, UAGs are dynamic in nature due to the
constant activity. Also, user activity on OSNs may or may
not be reciprocal, whereas OSN friendships always are.1
This means OSN friendship graphs are undirected, whereas
UAGs are directed in nature. Furthermore, user activity
on OSNs is not always based on the underlying friendship
graph,2 and UAGs exhibit temporal variance in graph prop-
erties that do not exist for OSN friendship graphs [16]. Due
to these diﬀerences, existing work on friendship graphs is
inapplicable to UAGs.
A number of questions regarding UAGs from social ap-
plications remain unanswered, including whether or not it
is possible to model UAGs from social applications, just as
researchers have modeled OSN friendship graphs. Our in-
tent is to explore the possibility of modeling UAGs from
all social applications on the largest OSN, Facebook. These
1Relationships on Twitter do not qualify as friendships, but
rather as user-follower relations.
2For example, adaptations of board games such as Scrab-
ble to Facebook applications have mostly been played with
random application users rather than one’s OSN friends.

able on Facebook to achieve growth in user base. These
growth mechanisms are Application Requests (ARs), News-
feed Stories, Emails, and Paid Advertising (see Section 3.1).
Among these, only ARs are used by all Facebook applica-
tions. Based on this last observation, this paper focuses on
understanding the growth of UAGs through ARs by study-
ing, and modeling, UAGs from one genre of Facebook ap-
plications, namely, gifting applications. We say a social ap-
plication is in the gifting genre if it consists of only one
feature, and that this feature enables inter-user sharing of
virtual gifts through ARs.
Our survey of the top 250 Facebook applications shows
that gifting is the second-most popular genre of Facebook
applications behind gaming, and that all Facebook gaming
applications use gifting as a feature to increase growth. Fur-
thermore, since gifting applications use only the AR mech-
anism, their UAGs are simpler to model than applications
that use more than just the AR growth mechanism. As a
starting point to model UAGs from social applications, we
investigate modeling UAGs from only gifting applications in
this paper. We use static snapshots of empirical UAGs from
three popular gifting applications on Facebook to study the
growth of UAGs. This approach of studying evolution of a
graph by studying its static snapshots has been advocated
previously ([10]), and it enables us to address the following
questions regarding UAGs:
(1) How do UAGs from social applications diﬀer
from friendship graphs obtained from OSNs?
Unlike creation and deletion of friendships on OSNs, we
have previously observed year-round dynamic patterns in
the UAGs obtained from one gaming and three gifting ap-
plications [16]. In addition to daily and weekly variations in
user activity, reliably high user activity is observed during
special occasions and holidays (Valentine’s Day, New Year,
Christmas, etc.). Also unlike friendship graphs where friend-
ships are almost always mutual, user activity is not always
reciprocal. The lack of reciprocity in user activity gives rise
to distinct in- and out-degree distributions. Furthermore, in
our gifting UAGs, there is an explicit cost associated with
initiation of activities (outgoing edges); i.e., the total num-
ber of activities that can be initiated by a user is capped
at a limit. This is due to a throttling mechanism used by
Facebook to limit spam in the network, which ampliﬁes the
distinction between in- and out-degree distributions.
(2) Existing graph models generate ‘acceptable’
synthetic friendship graphs [19, 13]. Do these mod-
els suﬃce when modeling user activity from social
gifting applications?
We evaluate intent- and feature-driven algorithms (such
as Nearest Neighbor and Forest Fire) reported to gener-
ate graphs that are statistically similar to OSN friendship
graphs. We ﬁnd the procedures employed in the original
as well as existing hybrid versions of these algorithms are
too simplistic to generate gifting UAGs. For instance, our
results show that our gifting UAGs exhibit degree struc-
tures that are more complex than for friendship graphs. In
particular, out-degree distributions in our UAGs cannot be
explained simply by power-laws, and are not summarized
by any known parameterized distribution. In contrast, OSN
friendship graphs exhibit degree structures that are often
explained by single power-laws [3].
(3) What key features should be considered to
model UAGs from gifting applications? How do
these features change with time?
Research on friendship graph modeling suggests a small
number of metrics that are suﬃcient to summarize friend-
ship graphs, i.e., clustering coeﬃcients, degree distributions,
and number/size of connected components [19]. We explore
these metrics in conjunction with more focused user behavior
metrics from our applications i.e., likelihoods of interacting
with inactive users and targeting new users, and distribu-
tions of user lifetimes and number of daily interactions.
Our analysis of gifting UAGs shows that degree distri-
butions as well as connected component size distributions
tend to stabilize over approximately one week of user activ-
ity. Clustering coeﬃcients are too small to reliably stabilize
for our gifting applications, while the number of connected
components do not stabilize, but instead may increase or de-
crease given the phase of the application’s lifetime. We also
observe that all metrics vary from week to week, depending
on overall trends in application usage.
(4) Finally, is it possible to model user activity on
a class of social applications that utilize the same
underlying growth mechanism?
We use our understanding of the social application growth
process to provide an algorithm tailored to a class of ap-
plications, namely gifting, that uses one particular growth
mechanism, namely ARs. Unlike existing friendship models,
our algorithm decouples in- and out-degrees to provide syn-
thetic graph structures similar to our gifting UAGs. Our al-
gorithm uses application-speciﬁc metrics such as active user
duration, distribution of daily number of activities, etc. as
inputs to facilitate accuracy of the synthetic graph produced.
By varying inputs to this algorithm, we show its eﬃcacy in
generating weekly synthetic graphs for all of the gifting ap-
plications we study. We also perform rigorous analysis of
the degree distributions produced by our algorithm. This
analysis provides a mathematical formula that describes the
expected distribution in activity level among users.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst attempt to
model UAGs from OSN-based applications. Due to similar-
ity of structure and the pervasive use of ARs, we believe our
model is applicable to other Facebook gifting applications
as well. Our ﬁndings can be leveraged to forecast a gifting
application’s usage. The synthetic UAGs generated by our
model provide an alternative to sharing large data sets that
may violate user privacy.
We begin this paper with a discussion of related work
in Section 2, followed by a discussion of our methodology,
including the graph metrics we use to model gifting UAGs, in
Section 3. We analyze measurements for our selected graph
metrics in Section 4, and present our UAG growth model in
Section 5 with a discussion of its potential uses. We discuss
future work and conclude the paper in Section 6.
2. RELATED WORK
Spurred by the increasing relevance of OSNs to online user
activity, there has been an increase in analyses of OSNs over
the last few years [11]. While some researchers have ana-
lyzed usage patterns of popular OSNs, others have focused
on graph theoretic properties of OSNs such as YouTube [15].
Research into OSN network growth has resulted in multi-
ple algorithms that produce synthetic graphs to mimic OSN
friendship graph properties. These algorithms derive con-
468cepts from earlier graph theory [18], including algorithms
for oﬄine social network growth, such as Nearest Neighbor,
Random Walk, Barabasi-Albert, and so on [19]. Moreover,
some research marries preferential attachment with latent
node characteristics to study OSN network growth [9].
Researchers have also studied time-varying OSN graphs
[20, 8]. Gummadi et al. report on the strength of user inter-
actions on Facebook using indigenous OSN applications in
[25]. They ﬁnd that communication decreases among users
from the point of friendship formation due to relationship fa-
tigue. Leskovec et al. propose that graphs over time do not
follow the same patterns or exhibit the same attributes as
they did when they were initially formed, and presents the
Forest Fire algorithm to model OSN network growth [13].
Other research has focused on information dissemination
patterns on OSNs [21, 2]. Li et al. have suggested that
in complex networks, relying on statistical methods cannot
provide an idea of which features are essential to the topol-
ogy’s formation [14]. Instead, they propose that knowledge
of the building blocks of network activity is essential to un-
derstand growth of networks. Furthermore, Holme et al.
propose studying static snapshots of graphs to study evolu-
tion of temporal networks [10].
The lack of availability of real data sets from OSNs has
slowed research into growth patterns on OSNs. This is
especially true for social applications on OSNs, for which
high-level statistical analyses exist ([5, 16, 17, 6]), yet whose
growth processes have not been studied.
Our social applications provide us a unique opportunity
to study the growth of OSN-based applications [16, 17]. We
believe the observation of Gummadi et al. on user fatigue
holds true for social applications as well, since application
novelty can explain early application growth and user fatigue
could account for its decline. We ﬁnd that growing and aged
graphs exhibit diﬀerent patterns ([13]) for UAGs as well. To
the best of our knowledge, this paper is the ﬁrst to study
and model growth of user activity on social applications.
3. METHODOLOGY AND RATIONALE
Our end-goal is to study growth processes of all OSN-
based applications. However, due to limited access to OSN
application data, we use only applications on the largest
OSN, Facebook, as a case study.
3.1 Growth Mechanisms of OSN Applications
Facebook applications allow subscribed users to interact
with non-subscribing users to encourage application growth
on the OSN. We deﬁne a subscribing user on a Facebook
application as someone who has ‘logged in’ to the applica-
tion through an installation screen presented by Facebook
for that application. Moreover, online social applications
belong to diﬀerent genres. While some of the more complex
applications (games) target audience that seek high engage-
ment in OSN applications,3 other simpler applications (gift-
ing) target casual users i.e., users that spend only a short
time on social applications.
Application statistics websites ([27], [26]) rank Facebook
applications according to Monthly Active Users (MAU) [16].
Our review of these rankings indicates that gaming and gift-
ing applications are the two largest sets of Facebook appli-

enue generated per subscriber.
cations. In particular, our review (using Developer Analyt-
ics [27]) in January 2012 showed that 74.4% of the top 250
Facebook applications by MAU were Flash or text-based
gaming applications, while 9.43% were gifting applications,
followed by other smaller genres of applications.4
We study growth processes for social applications using
the OSN-based application architecture (Figure 1(a)), dis-
cussed in [16]. These growth processes depend on the growth
mechanisms employed by social applications. Facebook pro-
vides the following growth mechanisms:
• Application Requests (ARs): Facebook users are
able to send ARs to their friends, allowing them to
recruit friends to applications free of cost. The AR
growth mechanism is illustrated by steps 1 and 5 in
Figure 1(a). If User A sends an AR to User B, the send-
ing user performs step 1 and the OSN (asynchronously)
performs step 5 for User B. When a user receives an
AR, she can either accept it or ignore it. Accepting an
AR presents non-subscribing users with an installation
page, and subscribed users are shown the reason(s)
they were sent an AR. An AR is sent by a subscribing
user to any friend on Facebook, whether subscribed to
the application or not. Facebook limits the number of
these outgoing requests on a given application through
an internal spam-control algorithm. For our applica-
tions, the daily per-user AR limit for an application
was typically 20, but could be as high as 60. There
are, however, no limits on ARs a user may receive.
• Newsfeed Stories: Newsfeed stories are personalized
posts on a user’s proﬁle made through applications by
subscribed users. Facebook controls the visibility of
Newsfeed stories to users’ friends through an internal
algorithm that prioritizes a story’s importance to the
viewing user. A Newsfeed story can be posted by a
subscriber to any friend, whether subscribed to the ap-
plication or not. Our review shows 88% of the top 250
applications prompt users to share a Newsfeed story in
at least one sequence of actions. Note that due to the
algorithm Facebook uses to display Newsfeed stories to
users, as well as the passive nature of Newsfeed stories
compared to ARs, the latter have been more reliable
for application growth in our experience.
• Emails: Pending a subscribed user’s approval, Face-
book allows applications to send e-mail notiﬁcations to
their personal e-mail addresses when an event occurs.
Since users often perceive allowing e-mail access to so-
cial applications as a security risk, developers do not
use this communication channel often. We found only
36% of the top 250 applications at least ask users for
their email addresses, but it is not practical to measure
how often this mechanism is utilized due to the com-
plex nature of user ﬂows in most gaming applications.
• Paid Advertising: Application developers on Face-
book may purchase advertisements to boost subscrip-
tion growth. However, we are unable to discern how
widely this mechanism is used by analyzing the appli-
cations alone. Anecdotally, most social games tend to
use advertisements to increase subscription growth.
Our review of the top 250 Facebook applications sug-
gests applications may use one or all growth mechanisms.
4Since the genre listings of applications can be inaccurate,
we categorized the top 250 applications manually.
469However, all applications use ARs. Our data allows us to
study speciﬁcally the growth process arising from use of ARs
through UAGs from Facebook-based gifting applications. We
deﬁne a gifting application as an application that 1) uses
only ARs for growth and inter-user communication, and 2)
only allows users to share themed images (gifts) through
ARs with their Facebook friends.
3.2 Measuring Gifting Application UAGs
We employ UAGs from three Facebook gifting applica-
tions to study application growth through the AR growth
mechanism. The architecture of the Platform used is shown
in Figure 1(a). We say a single user activity occurs on a
gifting application when steps 1 and 5 are performed by the
sending user A, and the OSN, respectively. The third-party
application servers record the sending and receiving users’
Facebook UIDs with the time at which the activity was gen-
erated. We only studied anonymized data for our research.
Each node in the UAG represents a Facebook user, and
each directed edge from User A to User B represents an AR
sent from User A to User B. Note that our UAGs are multi-
graphs, i.e., User A may have multiple directed edges to User
B. Our UAGs were obtained through server-side measure-
ments of the following Facebook-based gifting applications,
which were owned and operated by Manakki, LLC:
• iHeart: Launched in June 2009, iHeart grew to 30
million monthly active users by December 2009, and
was installed by 76 million users on Facebook by Au-
gust 2010. Our user activity traces capture 2.2 billion
activities. Users share decorative heart-shaped graph-
ics with their Facebook friends.
• iSmile: Launched in August 2008, iSmile was installed
by 43 million users on Facebook by August 2010. Our
user activity traces for iSmile capture 1.5 billion user
activities. Users share graphics of smiling characters
with their Facebook friends.
• Hugged: Launched in February 2008, Hugged was
installed by 28 million users on Facebook by August
2010. Our user activity traces for Hugged capture 1.6
billion user activities. Users share graphics of hugging
characters with their Facebook friends.
iHeart was a very popular application that ranked in the
