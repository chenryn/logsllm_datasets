### Title: Black Hat US-18: LTE Network Automation Under Threat

The transition from manual to automated control and management in mobile networks is driven by the need to enhance performance, improve efficiency, and reduce operational costs. In particular, base stations in modern 4G/LTE networks can self-configure and operate autonomously, a capability known as Self-Organizing Networks (SON). Additionally, these base stations can automatically adjust their settings based on data from neighboring base stations.

This presentation examines the potential risks associated with the operation of a rogue base station within an automated 4G/LTE network. We will explore the vulnerabilities we identified in 4G/LTE mobile devices and SON protocols, which can be exploited to inject malicious packets into the network. We will demonstrate several attack scenarios and discuss mitigation strategies from the perspective of mobile network operators.
