**Request:**
Please extract the template from the following log line:
```
NIFF: node node-150 has detected an available network connection on network 5.5.224.0 via interface alt0
```

**Response:**
The extracted template for the log line is:
```
NIFF: node node-<node_id> has detected an available network connection on network <network_address> via interface alt0
```

In this template:
- `<node_id>` represents the unique identifier for the node (e.g., `150`).
- `<network_address>` represents the IP address of the network (e.g., `5.5.224.0`).
