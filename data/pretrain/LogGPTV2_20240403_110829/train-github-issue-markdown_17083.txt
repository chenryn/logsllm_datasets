Not when I hard reset my computer with a physical reset button which is quite
accessible and happens to be right next to the USB ports.

Open atom, type some text, and hit `Ctrl+Q`

I should not be able to lose work at all, at any time, for any reason. In
sublime I can do the above and then immediately re-open and all is well.

To summarize, we need a few things:
  * Save unnamed buffers when atom is closed normally
  * Porting the "hot exit" feature from sublime. When atom is closed, it is immediately closed without any popup and can be re-opened in the exact state it was left
  * On some configurable interval we save the state to allow the application to pick back up in case of fire
