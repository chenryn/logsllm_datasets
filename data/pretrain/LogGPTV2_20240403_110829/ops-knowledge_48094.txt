User: Spinning off from another thread, when is it appropriate to use os.system() to issue commands like rm -rf, cd, make, xterm, ls ?
Considering there are analog versions of the above commands (except make and xterm), I'm assuming it's safer to use these built-in python commands instead of using os.system()
Any thoughts? I'd love to hear them.
Assistant: Darin's answer is a good start.
Beyond that, it's a matter of how portable you plan to be. If your program is only ever going to run on a reasonably "standard" and "modern" Linux then there's no reason for you to re-invent the wheel; if you tried to re-write make or xterm they'd be sending the men in the white coats for you. If it works and you don't have platform concerns, knock yourself out and simply use Python as glue!
If compatibility across unknown systems was a big deal you could try looking for libraries to do what you need done in a platform independent way. Or you need to look into a way to call on-board utilities with different names, paths and mechanisms depending on which kind of system you're on.
