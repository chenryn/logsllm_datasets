User:  Tell me how to use Git to manage software source code, including git add, git commit, git push and other common commands.
Assistant: Git is a very popular version control tool that helps teams manage software source code. The following is the basic process and common commands for using Git to manage software source code: 1. Initialize the Git repository: Use the git init command in the root directory of the software project to initialize the directory as a Git repository. 2. Add files: Use the git add command to add the files to be added to the Git temporary storage area. For example, to add a file named hello.py, you can use the following command: ``` git add hello.py ``` Or you can add all files using the following command: ``` git add . ``` 3. Commit Code: Use the git commit command to submit the code in the temporary storage area to the local code base. The following command can be used: ``` git commit -m "commit message" ``` The commit message is required, it can record the reason for the code change. 4. Push to the remote code base: Use the git push command to push the code in the local code base to the remote code base. You must first configure the address of the remote code base, as well as account and password information. You can use the following command: ``` git push origin master ``` Among them, origin is the name of the remote code base, and master is the name of the branch, which can be modified according to the actual situation. These are commonly used commands of Git. In most cases, you only need to learn these to achieve basic version control and code management. Of course, Git also has many advanced features that require more time to learn and use.
