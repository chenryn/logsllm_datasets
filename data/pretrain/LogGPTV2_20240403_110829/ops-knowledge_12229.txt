Question: A network engineer suggests that routers are an essential component for the expansion of a company's existing local area network (LAN) infrastructure. Evaluate the engineer's assertion by selecting the statements that correctly identify the pros and cons of introducing routers into the network.
"A": "Installing routers will allow for scalability by connecting multiple LANs, but it may introduce a single point of failure if not properly redundant.",
"B": "Routers can isolate network traffic within each LAN, reducing the chances of network congestion, but they can also cause increased latency due to message forwarding.",
"C": "By using routers, communication between LANs becomes impossible, as routers are designed to block all inter-LAN traffic.",
"D": "Routers simplify the network topology by directly connecting every machine to every other machine across the network, which can enhance communication efficiency."
Answer: AB
