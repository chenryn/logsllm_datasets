Question: An application developer needs to store sensitive information, such as API keys, within an application's executable file. Which of the following methods would be the most secure for storing this information, considering that attackers can reverse engineer binary code to obtain secret data?
"A": "Encrypt the sensitive information using a symmetric key algorithm before embedding it into the executable.",
"B": "Compress the sensitive information using a standard compression algorithm to reduce its size and then store it in the executable.",
"C": "Encode the sensitive information using base64 encoding and store it in the executable.",
"D": "Store the sensitive information in a separate configuration file outside of the executable and encrypt the file."
Answer: AD
