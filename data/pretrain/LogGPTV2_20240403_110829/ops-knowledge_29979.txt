User: I have a .bat that sets up an environment which allows users to execute several python scripts for specific jobs. My goal is to create links to the scripts.
For example, the user runs the .bat, a cmd window pops up, and instead of typing python theLongestPythonScriptNameInTheWorld.py he types python go.
My target platform is windows XP, so mklink wont work here. I don't want to use fsutil hardlink. Also, I simply tried set ok=theLongestPythonScriptNameInTheWorld.py, but id rather avoid the user having to type python %go% (the modulos, since it would piss me off if i was required to type modulos). I also want to avoid WSH because I want this to run on native XP installs.
Are there any other solutions besides mklink, fsutil, set, and WSH?
Assistant: When doing something similar for myself, I just created a few more batch files.
For example, you could provide a py_go.bat to invoke python theLongestPythonScriptNameInTheWorld.py
