Question: You are developing a secure Android application that requires the generation of an RSA key with a specific set of cryptographic properties for digital signing. Which combination of features and configurations should you request from the Android Keystore to ensure the key meets your application's security requirements?
"A": "Generate an RSA key of 2048-bit key size with RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 padding mode for signing, and specify a public exponent of F4 (2^16+1).",
"B": "Generate an RSA key of 512-bit key size with RSASSA-PSS padding mode for encryption, and specify a public exponent of F3 (2^15+1).",
"C": "Generate an RSA key of 3072-bit key size with RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5 padding mode for decryption, and enforce an authorization list with `TAG::KEY_SIZE` of 3072.",
"D": "Generate an ECDSA key using the NIST P-256 curve with SHA-256 digest mode for signing, and specify arbitrary public exponents for RSA."
Answer: A
