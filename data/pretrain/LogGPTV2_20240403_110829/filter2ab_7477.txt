**ATT&CK ID:** S1066  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** DarkTortilla

**Description:**
DarkTortilla is capable of scanning a compromised system to identify running processes and services that are indicative of virtualization or sandboxing environments. Specifically, it can detect the presence of Hyper-V, QEMU, Virtual PC, VirtualBox, VMware, and Sandboxie.[14]

This technique allows the malware to determine whether it is operating in a controlled environment, potentially enabling it to alter its behavior to evade detection or analysis.
