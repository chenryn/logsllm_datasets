It would be really helpful if the profile attribute could take names of
profiles that all has to be active.
For instance:
        ...
        ...
As for syntax there would need to be a notation that can express both OR and
AND, possibly using | and ,
Like:
        ...
Even better would be if the syntax was in line with other expressions such as
SpEL.
