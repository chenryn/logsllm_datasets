User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Remote access to server via service control panel for non-admin user in Windows 2008 I'm trying to configure my Windows 2008 servers so that my developers can view their status without needing to log on to the box or be an admin. Unfortunately, the permissions set in Windows 2008 for remote non-admin users don't include the ability to enumerate or otherwise query services. This causes anything that contacts the SCM on the far end to fail (Win32_Service, sc.exe, services.msc etc).

How do I set up permissions so that they can at least list the services and see if they are running?

Assistant: After some googling around today, I found this MSDN article. It seems to work so far, even though the security descriptor is for Windows Server 2003. I've found you can do sc sdshow SCMANAGER to get the current value so when back in the office tomorrow I'll be comparing an contrasting to make sure I've not locked something out I shouldn't have :-)
