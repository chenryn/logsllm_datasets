User: I'm writing a shell script in Python for bash.  The script automatically runs when the user logs into the account, and I want it to log the user out when it exits.  I tried using os.system('exit'), but it doesn't work.  How would I achieve this?
Assistant: Set your python script as the login shell of the user(in /etc/passwd/). This way she will be automatically logged out after the script exits.
