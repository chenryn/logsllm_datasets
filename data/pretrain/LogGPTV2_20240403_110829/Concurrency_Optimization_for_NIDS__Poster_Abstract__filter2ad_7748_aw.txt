Metabolomics as a tool to discover metabolite biomarkers for cow milk allergy diagnosis
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Lynn Vanhaecke, Ghent University, Belgium
CO-AUTHORS: Ellen De Paepe, Lieven Van Meulebroek, Eric Cox
In industrialized nations, food allergies are a growing epidemic and are considered a major thread to our wellbeing Cow milk allergy is one of 
the first allergies to occur in early childhood and early life sensitization has been associated with an increased risk to develop the atopic march, 
including eczema, asthma and other food allergies later in life As such, more research is urgently needed to gain more insights into this disease 
Therefore, this study evaluated a unique multi-matrix platform for polar metabolic fingerprinting of feces, plasma and urine, applying UHPLC-
Q-OrbitrapTM-HRMS, to determine the optimal matrix for future research on cow milk allergy in children Plasma is popular for metabolomic 
analysis, but collection is problematic in young children, while feces and urine are readily available biofluids All three fingerprinting approaches 
were proven ‘fit-for-purpose’ through extensive validation in which excellent linearity (R2 > 099 or 090 respectively), recovery and precision 
(coefficient of variance  10)

Investigation of Plasmodium falciparum metabolome by UHPLC-ESI-HRMS: case study of two chemoresistant strains
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Denis Desoubzdanne, French Armed Forces Biomedical Research Institute (IRBA), France
CO-AUTHORS: Laura Desnouveaux, Jérôme Dormoi, Nicolas Taudon
Malaria is still one of the most widespread parasitic tropical diseases Moreover, parasitic chemoresistance towards different antimalarial drugs is 
still expanding, whereas the biochemical mechanisms of its agent are so far poorly understood In this context, we have proposed to investigate 
intra-parasitic metabolome of two Plasmodium falciparum strains by UHPLC-ESI-HRMS approach The parasites were synchronized in schizonte 
stage after a Sorbitol treatment and a magnetic field separation (VarioMACS™ Separator, Miltenyi Biotec) In one hand, the African Mefloquine 
resistant strain 3D7 was exposed to the active drug Chloroquine at three doses (0x, 05x and 1xIC50 for 3 h In the other hand, the Asiatic 
Chloroquine resistant strain W9 was exposed to the active drug Mefloquine at two doses (0x and 1xIC50) for 3 h Parasites were isolated to the 
red blood cells with a Saponine treatment and washed with PBS Intra-parasitic metabolites were extracted by microwaves in cold MeOH After 
phospholipids + proteins depletion and evaporation to dryness, metabolites were re-suspended in acidified water/MeOH They were separated 
with a Kinetex® Biphenyl LC column (Phenomenex) and then analyzed in both ESI+ and ESI- modes with an UHPLC-ESI-HRMS instrument (1290-
6550A QTOF, Agilent) Metabolomics data were processing and normalized thanks to the open-source web-based W4M platform developed by the 
French metabolomics community (Giacomoni F et al, 2014) Multivariate biostatistical analyses (PLS-DA, ANOVA) were realized in order to highlight 
putative signals correlated to the strain and/or the dose effects

Integrative analysis of in vivo host-parasite Metabolome, Genome and Transcriptome in malarial African children
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Wael Abdrabou, New York University, United Arab Emirates

Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria stands as one the most serious threats to global public health placing almost half of the world population at 
risk of infection Symptoms of Pf malaria appear during the intra-erythrocytic developmental stage of the parasite when infected Red Blood Cells 
rupture releasing more parasites into the blood However, host response to the infection can vary dramatically between individuals and between 
different ethnic groups through poorly understood mechanisms During blood stage, P falciparum engages with host in metabolites exchange 
and triggers de novo biogenesis pathways to ensure steady supply of nutrients needed for parasite proliferation In this research project, we 
conduct a longitudinal matched in vivo study that aims at describing metabolic perturbations in sub-Saharan African children during Pf malaria and 
investigating if and how metabolites could modulate host response to infection Our results reveal distinct metabolic processes and biochemical 
signatures in the serum samples of the infected children compared to their metabolomic profiles prior to infection The overall goal of the study is to 
investigate metabolic profiles, and associated genotypic variants and gene expression traits using an integrative multi-omics approach Achieving 
this goal will advance our understanding of the sources of variation in the host-parasite interactions taking place during malaria infection and 
provide a more holistic and systemic view to the biochemical-gene networks associated with the infection

Metabolic Response to Supplemental Carnitine Identifies a Distinct Septic Shock Phenotype of Early Mortality
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Kathleen Stringer, University of Michigan College of Pharmacy, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Michael Puskarich, Charles Evans, Alla Karnovsky, Alan Jones
Background: Metabolic phenotyping of sepsis is challenged by patient heterogeneity To better understand the metabolic derangements 
associated with early (28d) sepsis mortality, we are using metabolomics data from septic shock patients treated with supplemental L-carnitine 
Methods: Temporal serum metabolomics data from non-survivors and survivors enrolled in the carnitine dose-ranging phase of a clinical trial 
(NCT01665092) were compared P values were corrected for false discovery (FDR) Results: At T0, non-survivors (n=9), had higher median levels of 
measured acylcarnitines and a higher median C2:carnitine ratio (FDR<10%) versus survivors (n=12) Non-survivors also had T0 elevations in proline, 
histidine, and oleic acid (18:n-9) (FDR<15%) Carnitine (6, 12, 18 g) supplementation resulted in a non-dose dependent increase in median peak (T24) 
carnitine concentration (IQR) which was higher in non-survivors (562, 350-1132µM) versus survivors (222, 159-512µM; FDR=16%) Acyl-carnitines 
and C2:carnitine ratio remained elevated in non-survivors Post-carnitine levels of proline and histidine declined in non-survivors but oleic acid 
remained elevated and stearic acid (18:0) progressively increased (FDR=16%) Demographic and clinical data (age, total SOFA, lactate and BMI) were 
not different between groups Median (IQR) T0 renal SOFA was higher in non-survivors (10 [0-1] v 20 [1-25], p=004) but there was no association 
between it and peak carnitine Conclusion: Carnitine-treated non-survivors have evidence of disrupted carnitine metabolism prior to treatment that 
may contribute to elevated carnitine and acyl-carnitine levels in response to carnitine supplementation These patients also have an inflammatory 
metabolic profile that may preclude their therapeutic responsiveness to carnitine and contribute to their mortality

The neglected tropical disease Oncocherciasis, or River Blindness, is caused by an infection with the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus 
Approximately 17 million people, majority living in Africa, are infected world-wide Until today there is neither a cure or a non-invasive diagnostic test 
available Next, to enable PKPD studies with novel microfilaricide drug candidates, surrogate end-points and efficacy biomarkers are in high demand 
but non-existent Here we report on the use of multimodal untargeted mass-spectrometry based biomarker discovery to identify onchocerciasis-
associated metabolites and lipids in urine and plasma (Ovolvulus infected cases: 68 individuals with palpable nodules; lymphatic filariasis cases: 8 
individuals; non-endemic controls: 20 individuals)  We identified 2 plasma metabolites, viz inosine and hypoxanthine linked to filarial infection and 
one urine metabolite, ie cis-cinnamoylglycine, related to O volvulus infection Markers were confirmed (sensitivity, specificity) during a separate 
targeted validation experiment, using UPLC-HR-MS and UPLC-HR-MS/MS analysis Next steps will focus on the application of these markers in 
microfilaricide clinical trials, MDA efficacy surveys and epidemiological transmission studies

Fever is the most common reason that children present to Emergency Departments (EDs) in the UK Clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of 
bacterial infection are often non-specific, and no test exists for the accurate diagnosis of infection As a result, many children with viral infection 
are prescribed antibiotics unnecessarily, while others with serious bacterial infections are not treated in a timely manner and progress to sepsis 
In recent years, the ‘omics’ approaches to identifying biomarkers from the host-response to bacterial infection are proving promising In this study, 
lipidomic analysis was carried out with plasma samples obtained from febrile children with confirmed bacterial infection (n=20) and confirmed viral 
infection (n=20) We show for the first time that bacterial and viral infection elicit distinct changes in the host lipidome Glycerophosphoinositol, 
sphingomyelin, lysophosphotidylcholine and cholesterol sulate were increased in the confirmed virus infected group, while fatty acids, 
glycerophosphocholine, glycerophosphoserine, lactosylceramide and bilirubin were increased in cases of confirmed bacterial infection A 
combination of 20 metabolites increased diagnostic performance and achieved the AUC value of 0853 (95% CI, 0672 - 0995) This pilot study 
demonstrates the potential of metabolic biomarkers to distinguish bacterial from viral infection in febrile children, to facilitate effective clinical 
management and to limit inappropriate use of antibiotics
