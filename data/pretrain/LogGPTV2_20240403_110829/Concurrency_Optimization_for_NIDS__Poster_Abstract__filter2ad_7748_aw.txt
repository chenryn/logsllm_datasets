In industrialized nations, food allergies, particularly cow milk allergy (CMA), are a growing concern, affecting the well-being of many. CMA is one of the first allergies to occur in early childhood and has been linked to an increased risk of developing the atopic march, including eczema, asthma, and other food allergies later in life. To address this, our study evaluated a multi-matrix platform for polar metabolic fingerprinting of feces, plasma, and urine using UHPLC-Q-OrbitrapTM-HRMS. The goal was to determine the optimal matrix for future research on CMA in children. While plasma is commonly used for metabolomic analysis, its collection is challenging in young children. Feces and urine, however, are more readily available. Our validation showed excellent linearity (R² > 0.99 or 0.90, respectively), recovery, and precision (coefficient of variance < 1.0).

Malaria remains one of the most widespread parasitic tropical diseases, with chemoresistance to antimalarial drugs being a significant challenge. This study investigates the intra-parasitic metabolome of two Plasmodium falciparum strains using UHPLC-ESI-HRMS. The African Mefloquine-resistant strain 3D7 was exposed to Chloroquine at three doses (0x, 0.5x, and 1xIC50) for 3 hours, while the Asiatic Chloroquine-resistant strain W9 was exposed to Mefloquine at two doses (0x and 1xIC50) for 3 hours. Parasites were isolated from red blood cells and metabolites were extracted. After phospholipid and protein depletion, metabolites were analyzed using a Kinetex® Biphenyl LC column and UHPLC-ESI-HRMS. Data were processed and normalized using the W4M platform. Multivariate biostatistical analyses (PLS-DA, ANOVA) highlighted putative signals correlated with strain and dose effects.

### Integrative Analysis of In Vivo Host-Parasite Metabolome, Genome, and Transcriptome in Malarial African Children

Plasmodium falciparum malaria is a major global health threat, affecting nearly half of the world's population. Symptoms appear during the intra-erythrocytic developmental stage, but host responses vary significantly between individuals and ethnic groups. During this stage, P. falciparum engages in metabolite exchange with the host and triggers de novo biogenesis pathways. This study conducts a longitudinal matched in vivo study to describe metabolic perturbations in sub-Saharan African children during P. falciparum malaria. Our results reveal distinct metabolic processes and biochemical signatures in the serum samples of infected children compared to their pre-infection profiles. The overall goal is to investigate metabolic profiles and associated genotypic and gene expression traits using an integrative multi-omics approach. This will enhance our understanding of host-parasite interactions and provide a holistic view of the biochemical-gene networks involved in the infection.

### Metabolic Response to Supplemental Carnitine Identifies a Distinct Septic Shock Phenotype of Early Mortality

Sepsis is a complex condition characterized by patient heterogeneity. To better understand the metabolic derangements associated with early sepsis mortality, we analyzed metabolomics data from septic shock patients treated with supplemental L-carnitine. Temporal serum metabolomics data from non-survivors (n=9) and survivors (n=12) enrolled in a clinical trial (NCT01665092) were compared. At baseline (T0), non-survivors had higher levels of acylcarnitines and a higher C2:carnitine ratio (FDR<10%) compared to survivors. Non-survivors also had elevated proline, histidine, and oleic acid (18:n-9) (FDR<15%). Carnitine supplementation resulted in a non-dose-dependent increase in median peak (T24) carnitine concentration, which was higher in non-survivors (562, 350-1132µM) versus survivors (222, 159-512µM; FDR=16%). Acyl-carnitines and C2:carnitine ratio remained elevated in non-survivors. Post-carnitine levels of proline and histidine declined in non-survivors, but oleic acid remained elevated and stearic acid (18:0) progressively increased (FDR=16%). Demographic and clinical data (age, total SOFA, lactate, and BMI) were not different between groups. Median (IQR) T0 renal SOFA was higher in non-survivors (1.0 [0-1] vs. 2.0 [1-2.5], p=0.04), but there was no association with peak carnitine. These findings suggest that non-survivors have disrupted carnitine metabolism prior to treatment, which may contribute to their mortality.

### Elevated Plasma and Urine Biomarkers for Active Onchocerca volvulus Infections

Onchocerciasis, or River Blindness, is a neglected tropical disease caused by the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus, affecting approximately 17 million people, primarily in Africa. There is currently no cure or non-invasive diagnostic test available. To enable PKPD studies with novel microfilaricide drug candidates, surrogate endpoints and efficacy biomarkers are urgently needed. This study used multimodal untargeted mass-spectrometry-based biomarker discovery to identify onchocerciasis-associated metabolites and lipids in urine and plasma. We identified two plasma metabolites, inosine and hypoxanthine, linked to filarial infection, and one urine metabolite, cis-cinnamoylglycine, related to O. volvulus infection. These markers were confirmed during a targeted validation experiment using UPLC-HR-MS and UPLC-HR-MS/MS analysis. Future steps will focus on applying these markers in microfilaricide clinical trials, MDA efficacy surveys, and epidemiological transmission studies.

### Viral and Bacterial Infection Elicit Distinct Changes in Plasma Lipids in Febrile Children

Fever is the most common reason for children to present to Emergency Departments (EDs) in the UK. Clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of bacterial infection are often non-specific, and no test exists for accurate diagnosis. As a result, many children with viral infections are unnecessarily prescribed antibiotics, while others with serious bacterial infections are not treated promptly and progress to sepsis. Recent 'omics' approaches have shown promise in identifying biomarkers from the host response to bacterial infection. In this study, lipidomic analysis was performed on plasma samples from febrile children with confirmed bacterial (n=20) and viral (n=20) infections. We found that bacterial and viral infections elicit distinct changes in the host lipidome. Glycerophosphoinositol, sphingomyelin, lysophosphatidylcholine, and cholesterol sulfate were increased in the viral infection group, while fatty acids, glycerophosphocholine, glycerophosphoserine, lactosylceramide, and bilirubin were increased in the bacterial infection group. A combination of 20 metabolites achieved an AUC value of 0.853 (95% CI, 0.672 - 0.995). This pilot study demonstrates the potential of metabolic biomarkers to distinguish bacterial from viral infections in febrile children, facilitating effective clinical management and limiting inappropriate antibiotic use.
