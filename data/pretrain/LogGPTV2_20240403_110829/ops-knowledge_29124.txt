User: I need to test my Python package if it works properly on different systems. I found Tox for different Python versions, but what about different operating systems like Windows, Linux and Mac. 
Can you recommend me a convenient way to test if my code works on all systems?
Assistant: Just assuming you use Windows...
I use Ubuntu on WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2). It is basically a virtual machine, but is much faster than Hyper-V or Virtual box. It doesn't come with a GUI unless you're in the Windows Insiders Dev Channel, but that is likely not needed just  to test code, and you can install GWSL (an X server designed for WSL and SSH) to provide a GUI. On my laptop, Hyper-V and VirtualBox VMs crash within seconds of starting, but WSL2 runs smoothly for hours of intense usage. For an IDE, I would recommend installing Visual Studio Code (on Windows,not on the WSL2 VM), then use the Remote - WSL extension. And I would recommend installing Windows Terminal to replace the ugly Windows Console Host. And for MacOS, I guess you just have to use a regular VM.
