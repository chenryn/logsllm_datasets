wanted to identify the neural patterns when people respond to 
warnings associated with malware. Modern browsers use these 
warning  mechanisms  to  alert  users  in  case  they  visit  a  likely 
suspicious web site [11] and rely upon users’ input to proceed. 
Our  malware  warnings  experiment  consisted  of  several 
snapshots  of  news  samples  and  pop-ups  of  two  types:  non-
warnings  and  warnings.  A  non-warning  pop-up  contained 
casual  information  or  questions  in  it,  and  a  warning  pop-up 
  5
contained  details  about  the  malware  threat.  In  this  way,  the 
non-warning  pop-up  served  as  a  control  condition  for  the 
warning  pop-up.  The  article  itself  served  the  purpose  of  a 
primary  task  the  user  is  engaged  in.  The  news  samples  were 
collected from popular news websites such as CNN, BBC, LA 
Times, ABC News, and Slashdot.org. We collected news items 
from  all  major  categories  like  entertainment,  sports,  politics, 
and general news. We recreated the web pages on our own as 
the  E-Prime  software  only  supports  a  resolution  of  640*480 
formatted  in  Bitmap  configuration.  We  simulated  the  real-
website  by  showing  abstracts  of 
the  news  first.  The 
participants can click on the read more option to read the full 
news item. When they clicked on “full news” we showed them 
a  pop-up  with  a  warning/non-warning  asking  them  if  they 
wanted  to  proceed.  Depending  upon  their  response,  the  next 
populated page was either a full news article or a blank page. 
Experiment  Design  (Malware  Warnings):  This  task  required 
that the subject read a series of articles. While they are reading 
the  articles,  they  were  randomly  interrupted  by  a  pop-up 
asking  a  specific  question  (non-warning),  or  by  a  pop-up 
warning (about a malicious threat).

Fig 3(b). A Snapshot of Warning 
The  experiment  started  with  the  instructions  set  followed 
by a fixation trial of 10s. After the fixation, the abstract with 
“read  more”  link  was  presented  for  10s  and  when  the  user 
clicked on read more, a pop-up (warning or non-warning) was 
generated  asking  the  user  if  he/she  wanted  to  proceed.  If  the 
user  chose  not  to  proceed,  a  blank  screen  was  displayed  for 
10s, otherwise, a full news article was displayed for 10s. This 
was  an  event-based  design  and  the  user  gave  his  input  of 
yes/no  by  pressing  the  button.  We  incorporated  the  malware 
warnings  of  popular  web  browsers  like  Chrome,  Internet 
Explorer,  Opera,  and  Mozilla  [11].  It  was  difficult  to  display 
all  the  details  of  warnings  that  are  shown  by  these  browsers 
but we kept, to the extent possible, the excerpts similar to the 
warnings of these browsers. And the pop-ups contained casual 
messages,  such  as,  “We  are  collecting  the  details  about  the 
type  of  news  you  like.  Do  you  like  these  sorts  of  articles.” 
Figure 3(a) and 3(b) are samples of how the snapshots of the 
pop-ups looked. 
IV.  STUDY PROCEDURES 
Our  fMRI  study  followed  a  within-subjects  design, 
whereby  each  participant  performed  all  the  three  tasks, 
phishing  control,  phishing,  and  malware  warnings.  All  tasks 
were  performed  in  one  single  fMRI  scanning  session.  The 
study,  including  participant  recruitment  and  MRI  scanning, 
ran for a period of about 6 months. In the rest of this section, 
we  present  the  details  of  our  study  protocol,  including  the 
recruitment  and  demographics  of  our  study  participants,  and 
the procedures involved during the pre-scanning and scanning 
phases of the study.  
A.  Participant Recruitment & Demographics 
Twenty five  healthy  university students (14  males and 11 
females;  mean  age:   21.5  years)  participated  in  our  fMRI 
study.  Participant demographic information is summarized in 
Table  II.  The  participating  students  were  enrolled  in  various 
educational  programs,  including:  Biology,  Music,  Athletics, 
Psychology,  Communication  Studies,  Physical  Education, 
Biomedical  Engineering,  Pathology,  Physical  Therapy, 
Mathematics,  Medicine,  and  Computer  and  Information 
Sciences, forming a diverse sample.

Some  of  these  participants  were  recruited  through  a 
screening  questionnaire  administered  to  students  enrolled  in 
the  Introduction  to  Psychology  course  in  the  Department  of 
Psychology  at  our  University.  Participants  were  not  included 
if they indicated having metal implanted in their bodies (either 
surgically  or  accidentally),  indicated  possibly  being  pregnant 
or currently breastfeeding, or indicated having had a history of 
kidney  disease,  seizure  disorder,  diabetes,  hypertension, 
anemia, or sickle cell disease. Individuals were also excluded 
if 
taking  psychotropic  medications,  had 
claustrophobia, or had hearing problems. Participants were not 
recruited  if  they  indicated  a  history  of  a  developmental 
cognitive  disorder,  anxiety  disorder,  schizophrenia,  or 
obsessive-compulsive disorder. Some of the participants were 
also recruited via flyers posted on our University campus, and 
prospective participants could call a number listed on the flyer 
and  answer  a  screening  questionnaire  by  dialing 
in 
information through integrated voice response (IVR).

B.  Pre-Scanning Phase  
The  scans  were  performed  at  the  neuroimaging  facility 
available  to  us  at  our  University.  Participants  signed  an 
informed  consent 
form  approved  by  our  University’s 
Institutional Review Board. In addition, participants filled out 
an  Edinburgh  Handedness  form  [54],  an  MRI  safety 
questionnaire,  and  a  Barratt’s  Impulsivity  questionnaire  [1]. 
The  purpose  of  the  handedness  form  was  to  determine 
handedness  because  handedness  may 
the 
lateralization of hemispheric activity in the participants (right-
handed individuals may be more left-lateralized). The purpose 
of  the  impulsivity  questionnaire  was  to  determine  the  trait 
impulsivity  level  of  the  participants  (details  provided  in 
Section V.A).

to 
Prior  to  the  scan,  each  participant  was  shown  example 
images  for  both  the  tasks  (phishing  detection,  and  malware 
warnings) in the form of images on paper. We also explained 
that  the  participant  was  to  use  the  button  response  system  in 
the MRI scanner during the tasks.  
We did not tell the participants before the fMRI scan as to 
what  they  are  supposed  to  be  doing  in  the  phishing 
experiment.  This  was  to  make  sure  that  they  were  not 
influenced  by  the  “real”  or  “fake”  decision-making  thoughts 
while engaged in the phishing control experiment. The image 
for  the  phishing  control  experiment  was  a  screenshot  of  the 
Google home page. The image we showed to the participants 
for the malware experiment is one of the articles displayed in 
a browser pop-up asking a general question about the article.  
See  Figures  2(a),  2(b),  3(a),  and  3(b)  for  examples  shown  to 
the  participants.  We  did  not  show  an  example  of  a  malware 
warning  pop–up  to  the  participants  before  the  experiment  in 
order to avoid priming them explicitly. 
C.  Scanning Phase  
fMRI  data  was  collected  using  a  Siemens  3.0  T  Allegra 
head-only scanner (as discussed in Section II.B). For structural 
imaging,  initial  high  resolution  T1-weighted  scans  were 
acquired  using  a  160-slice  3D  MPRAGE  (Magnetization 
Prepared  Rapid  Gradient  Echo)  volume  scan  with  TR  =  200 
ms, TE = 3.34 ms, flip angle = 1210, FOV = 25.6 cm, 256 x 
256  matrix  size,  and  1  mm  slice  thickness.  A  single-shot 
gradient-recalled  echo-planar  pulse  sequence  was  used  to 
acquire  functional  images  (TR  =  1000  ms,  TE  =  30  ms,  flip 
angle=600,  FOV  =  24  cm,  matrix  =  64  x  64).  Seventeen 
adjacent  oblique  axial  slices  were  acquired  in  an  interleaved 
sequence with 5 mm slice thickness, 1 mm slice gap, a 24 x 24 
cm field of view (FOV), and a 64 x 64 matrix, resulting in an 
in-plane resolution of 3.75 x 3.75 x 5 mm3. 
For  each  participant,  we  set  the  order  of  the  phishing  and 
malware warnings tasks randomly, but always left the phishing 
control as the first task. We gave appropriate instructions to the 
participants  via  an  intercom  before  each  experiment  started. 
Instructions were also provided visually on the display screen 
in  the  MRI  scanner  at  the  beginning  of  each  task.  Each  task 
was  run  through  the  IFIS  System  Manager. Participants  made 
their responses using a fiber optic button response system that 
had  a  button  for  each  finger  on  both  hands.  They  indicated  a 
“yes”  response  using  their  right  index  finger  and  a  “no” 
response  using  their  left  index  finger.  The  session  start  time, 
end  time,  session  id,  and  the  order  that  each  task  was 
performed  were  recorded.  For  each  task,  except  the  phishing 
control  experiment, 
times  and  answers  were 
automatically  recorded  and  saved  as  dat  files.  The  total 
duration  for  the  phishing  control,  phishing  and  malware 
warnings tasks were 268s, 553s, and 751s.

After  the  scanning  phase  was  over,  we  compensated  the 
participant  with  Psychology  course  credits  or  a  $50  cash 
reward depending on their status.    
V.  ANALYSIS AND STUDY RESULTS 
In this section, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the 
data  acquired  during  our  study  and  attempt  to  interpret  the 
results. We report on the neuroimaging data analysis followed 
by the behavioral data analysis

superimposed  on  normalized  T1-weighted  images.  All  data 
were  intensity-thresholded  at  p=0.001,  with  a  cluster  size 
correction  per  region  for  a  family  wise  error  (FWE)  rate  of 
0.05.  To  determine  the  voxel  threshold  for  significance,  a 
minimum cluster thresholding operation was performed using 
the  AlphaSim  software  package  in  AFNI  (Analysis  of 
Functional  Neuroimages)  [57].  Ten-thousand  Monte  Carlo 
simulations  were  generated  to  maintain  the  family  wise  error 
(FWE)  rate  at  0.05  for  the  whole  brain.  Thus,  in  order  for  a 
given  region  to  be  considered  significantly  active,  it  should 
have a minimum cluster size of 64mm3. 
Table III lists the acronyms we will be using in the rest of 
the  paper  for 
the  brain  regions  associated  with  our 
experiments.  The  figure  below  provides  a  higher  level 
overview of these different regions and their general role.

format 
software 
(http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/).  Data  was  preprocessed 
using  SPM8 
for 
Neuroimaging,  London,  United  Kingdom)  within  MATLAB 
and  an  in-house  software.  Functional  data  preprocessing 
started with slice time correction to account for the interleaved 
pattern  of  scan  slice  acquisition.  All  slices  were  realigned  to 
the mean image in the scan. All images were then normalized 
to  the  EPI  template  provided  by  SPM8  using  a  2mm3 
resampling  voxel.  Head  motion  was  examined  in  three 
translational  directions  x,  y,  and  z,  and  three rotations:  pitch, 
roll,  and  yaw.  A  cut  off  point  of  1  mm  in  any  direction  was 
kept  as  the  criteria  for  motion.  After  these  quality  control 
measures,  data  from  three  participants  from  the  phishing 
experiment  were discarded resulting in 22 usable datasets for 
that experiment. Lastly, all normalized images were smoothed 
using a Gaussian filter of 8mm full width half maximum. 
Statistical analyses were performed on individual data and 
group  data  using  the  General  Linear  Model  (GLM).  In  GLM 
analysis, each voxel in the brain will have a signal time-series 
for  a  given  experiment  based  on  how  that  voxel  behaves  in 
response to a specific task. The GLM formula is Y = X*β+ε, 
where Y is the fMRI signal at various time points at a single 
voxel,  X  is  several  components  (the  design  matrix  with 
different  conditions,  such  as  real,  fake,  malware)  that  can 
explain  the  observed  fMRI  signal,  β  is  the  parameter  that 
defines  the  contribution  of  each  component  of  the  design 
matrix  to  the  value  of  Y,  and ε  is  the difference  between  the 
observed  data  (Y)  and  that  predicted  by  the  model  (X*β). 
Group  analyses  were  performed  using  a  random-effects 
model. Regions of interest (ROIs) with statistically significant 
activation  were  identified  using  a  t-statistic  on  a  voxel  by 
voxel  basis.  Separate  regressors  were  created  (for  real,  fake, 
and  fixation  stimuli  in  phishing  experiment,  and  abstract, 
warning,  and  no-warning  for  malware  experiment)  by 
convolving a boxcar function with the standard hemodynamic 
response  function  as  specified  in  SPM.  Statistical  maps  were
