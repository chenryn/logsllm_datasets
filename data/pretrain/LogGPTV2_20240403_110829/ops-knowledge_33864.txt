### Summary of the Log Chunk

This log chunk tracks the progress of 10 different task attempts in a Hadoop MapReduce job. The logs are generated by the `org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TaskAttemptListenerImpl` component, and each entry includes the following details: timestamp, log level (INFO), process ID (IPC Server handler), and the progress of the specific task attempt.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Timestamps**: The logs span from 18:04:20 to 18:04:25 on October 18th.
2. **Log Level**: All entries are at the INFO level.
3. **Process IDs**: The logs are generated by various IPC Server handlers (e.g., handler 18, handler 5, etc.).
4. **Task Attempts**: The progress is tracked for 10 different task attempts, identified by their unique IDs (e.g., `attempt_1445144423722_0020_m_000005_0`).
5. **Progress Values**: The progress values range from 0.10681946 to 0.6854124, indicating the completion percentage of each task attempt.
