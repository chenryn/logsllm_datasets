User: can't get virtualenvwrapper to work on Ubuntu 10.10 desktop.

mkvirtualenv test_env

returns:

ERROR: virtualenvwrapper could not find virtualenv in your path


I followed the install instructions to the letter.
Any ideas?
Assistant: I got that same message when installing virtualenvwrapper using the MacPorts package manager  (version py27-virtualenvwrapper @3.2_0). I had virtualenv installed, also via MacPorts. The only way I could get it to work was adding the bash environmental:
export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_VIRTUALENV=virtualenv-2.7
to my .profile file. Not at all Ubuntu 10.10, but if you've got a working virtualenv on your set-up, maybe virtualenvwrapper needs a pointer ...
