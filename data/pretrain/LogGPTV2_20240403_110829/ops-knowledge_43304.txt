I'm having trouble getting `virtualenvwrapper` to work on my Ubuntu 10.10 desktop. When I run the command `mkvirtualenv test_env`, I receive the following error message:

```
ERROR: virtualenvwrapper could not find virtualenv in your path
```

I have followed the installation instructions precisely, but I still encounter this issue. Do you have any suggestions for resolving it?

I encountered a similar problem when installing `virtualenvwrapper` using MacPorts (version py27-virtualenvwrapper @3.2_0). I had already installed `virtualenv` via MacPorts, but I received the same error message. To resolve the issue, I added the following line to my `.profile` file:

```bash
export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_VIRTUALENV=virtualenv-2.7
```

Although this solution is specific to MacPorts, it might be helpful if you have a working `virtualenv` installation. It seems that `virtualenvwrapper` may need a pointer to the correct `virtualenv` executable.
