User: What happens when you package a script as an executable? Is this a good way to distribute commercial applications? I remember I read something a long time ago that when you package scripts as executables, at runtime the exe decompresses the scripts to a temporary directory where they get ran.
If it's like that, than I don't think this can be viewed as a good solution, because a skilled user could find out where that directory is located and find the source code. I'm interested in Python & Ruby.
Assistant: Creating an application and creating a commercial software business are two distinct things. 
At my job we have a commercial application developed in Ruby on Rails that is installed at client sites; no obfuscation or encryption applied. 
There is just so much more going on at a business level: support, customization, training that it's almost ludicrous to think that they'd do something with the source code. Most sites are lucky if they can spare the cycles to manage the application, much less start wallowing in someone else's codebase. 
Now that being said, we aren't publicly distributing the code or anything, just that we've made the choice to invest in making the application better and doing better by our customers than to burn the time trying to restrict access to our application.
