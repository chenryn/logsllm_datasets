pDNS dataset and was visited by a mobile device. It is in-
teresting that this list includes several prominent desktop
malware classes such as Zeus and SpyEye in our ﬁltered
mobile trafﬁc.

with unique qnames in the m&a dataset after projection
through non-cellular pDNS data collection.
Somewhat unsurprisingly, Google Play (see Figure 8(b),
Android 500 class) has the lowest percentage of appli-
cations contacting hosts historically associated with mal-
ware. Only a 10% of the domain names observed in the
class Android 500 in Figure 8(b), have more than one mal-
ware sample associated with the host the domain names re-
solved to historically. These numbers increase in Figure 9,
which shows the projection of HOST Sm&a through our
passive DNS data collection from non-cellular networks us-
ing fmal(). As previously mentioned, such indirect results
are prone to false positives due to phenomena like parking
IPs and sinkholes; however, the inclusion of such hosts in an
application could easily serve to trigger analysis by market
operators.
In summary, mobile applications observed from a variety
of marketplaces and malware datasets use much of the same
Internet infrastructure as the non-cellular DNS resolutions.
This observation is similar to the analysis we made in Sec-
tion 5.1.1, when we examined DNS trafﬁc from a large cel-
lular provider. Perhaps the most important observation from
the m&a datasets is that some market-places (e.g., Softan-
droid) contain mobile applications that tend to be more di-
rectly and indirectly related with known malware-tainted
hosting infrastructure.
5.2 Mobile(cid:173)malicious activity in mobile networks
This subsection discusses two distinct but related phe-
nomenon: 1) the relationship between mobile platforms and
requests for tainted hosts, and 2) the presence of queries for
domains facilitating malware that targets mobile platforms.
5.2.2 Mobile malware in the cellular network
To answer the question ”How prevalent is the threat of ma-
licious mobile applications in the cellular network?”, we

data with a blacklist of 2,932 domains known to be asso-
ciated with mobile-malware or mobile-malware operators.
We then focused on those domains that are known to have
directly facilitated mobile malicious activity, not merely as-
sociated with it. Examples of this malicious activity in-
clude distributing malicious applications, exﬁltrating sen-
sitive data without user consent, and command and control
services.
We focused on 19 unique domains present in our cel-
lular pDNS data. These malicious domains are associated
with 10 unique malware families; all of these are Android
applications. 9 of these 10 malware families were publicly
disclosed before any of our epochs — meaning they were
still queried after they were known to be malicious by secu-
rity researchers, antivirus companies, and market providers.
[34, 33, 46, 11, 38, 3, 4, 5, 39]
Table 6 shows the mobile malware families with domains
seen in the cellular network, the number of domains known
to facilitate the malicious activities of those families, the
number of devices of any type and the number of mobile de-
vices that contacted a domain facilitating mobile malware.
Note that this data is aggregate across days and all domains
facilitating mobile malware; we cannot identify the same
device across epochs, so this is an upper bound of devices
that contact a domain. The effects of our conservative mo-
bile classiﬁcation process are apparent – only a fraction of
devices that we classify as mobile contacted any domain
that facilitates mobile malware compared to all devices.
The most prevalent malicious family in the network was
FakeDoc. This is a potentially unwanted application (ad-
ware) that steals a user’s Google account and other poten-
tially sensitive information. FakeDoc was discovered in the
Android market on October 19, 2011 well before our trafﬁc
epochs. Despite being ﬂagged by several antivirus prod-
ucts [4], 5,417 devices contacted the domain used by Fake-
Doc for malicious activity.
The second most popular malware family was NotCom-
patible. NotCompatible is a trojan application that acts as
an open network proxy. Unlike the other families in Table 6,
NotCompatible is spread through compromised web pages
with hidden iFrames that point to a download site for the
app. NotCompatible was disclosed on May 2, 2012 [46].
Even considering an upper bound, the overall trafﬁc to
domains associated with mobile malware is quite small.
Only 9,033 devices of any type out of a total of over 480M
million (0.001%), and 3,492 devices out of a total of 380M
conﬁrmed mobile devices (0.0009%) contacted a domain
known to facilitate mobile malware. The top two threats
present in our data present a stark contrast in functionality,
time of known activity, and method of distribution. Despite
these differences, neither presented signiﬁcant activity lev-
els during our measurement epochs.
A number of insights can be gleaned from this data. First
and foremost, mobile malware is a real threat to users in the
United States, despite the fact that malware researchers ﬁnd
many of their samples in non-US markets. Even though the
threat is real, it is minimal. It is important to note that the
overall size of all infected populations indicates that mobile
malware is far from reaching the scope or severity of desk-
top malware. This may be attributed to moderated markets,
security architectures of mobile platforms, and the relative
lack of opportunity an infected device can provide a mal-
ware author.
The low volumes of trafﬁc from malware distributed
through the Google Market indicate that market-based kill
switches can be effective at controlling the malware popula-
tion. However, the relative success of NotCompatible calls
into question whether the market-based kill switches will be
able to control the spread of malware in the future if mal-
ware authors eschew markets in favor of other distribution
means. Even when markets are used as a distribution chan-
nel, mobile malware can be seen in the network long af-
ter discovery by researchers and its removal from markets.
This ﬁnding implies that neither markets nor security prod-
ucts like antivirus tools are able to guarantee a malware-free
platform.
5.3 Lifecycle of Mobile Threats
In this section we examine the evolution of two mali-
cious mobile applications, threat ǫ and threat β. With his-
toric data from a large authoritative DNS server, we pro-
vide insights on how the threats developed over time as well
as geographical properties of the requesters requesting do-
mains associated with these threats. We conclude by pro-
viding some insight on the hosting infrastructure these mo-
bile threats used throughout their lifetime, especially at the
peak of their activity.

Table 6: Malicious Apps with Domains in Mobile Net-
work
Figure 10: DNS request volume for threat ǫ (2011)
Threat ǫ is an Android application that masquerades as a
legitimate client to a popular Internet streaming media ser-
vice. When run, the application presents a credible login
screen. When the user attempts to log in, the application
displays an error message and closes.
In the meantime,
it has sent the user’s credentials to domain qnameǫ in an
HTTP request. This threat was publicly disclosed by a ma-
jor anti-virus company in October 2011.
Threat β is an Android application that starts a service
after reboot that periodically contacts a C&C server hosted
on domain qnameβ. The service will respond to commands
received from the C&C or via SMS. One command causes
the application to sign all contacts up to an on-line mailing
list, while another command has the application send in-
fected download links to all contacts via SMS. These links
are on a different domain than qnameβ. The application
will automatically respond to received SMS with an offen-
Figure 11: DNS request volume for threat β (2010 to
2011)
sive message, and in certain cases will send offensive SMS
messages to all contacts. This threat was publicly disclosed
by a major anti-virus company in May 2011.
5.3.1 Lifetime and Infection Scale
Figure 10 shows the daily lookup volumes for qnameǫ,
which acts as a proxy for the victims of threat ǫ. These
lookups could be recursive DNS servers, so we cannot make
any claims about the size of the overall infected population.
The threat was most active on April 12th, but soon after
rapidly declines. The ﬁrst lookup for qnameǫ was recorded
on March 3rd, 2011, and by June 5th 3 there were DNS
requests from 2,731 unique requesters. Table 7 shows the
query volume, AS, and country code of the top ten net-
works that sent requests to qnameǫ; the majority of these
are based in the US. Of note is that this threat seems to
have ended well before it was publicly disclosed in October
2011; at the time of disclosure, qnameǫ no longer resolved
to a routable address.
Figure 11 shows the lifetime of threat β in terms of query
volume. This threat became active in January of 2010, and
at its peak in February – March 2011 it averaged more than
70,000 DNS requests per day. Over the 14 months that
this threat was active, 13,094 unique IP addresses queried
the domain name qnameβ. As before, this number can-
not be considered an absolute population estimate. Table 7
shows the distribution of the infected populations for mo-
bile threats β and ǫ. We see that a signiﬁcant portion of
the infected population resides in Asia-based networks. We
also note that Google (AS 15169) has a heavy impact on the
numbers in Table 7 (most likely due to crawling). Threat ǫ
was disclosed well past its peak in DNS requests.
3 We have no data from the authoritative DNS server after this date, so
we have no visibility into later activity
