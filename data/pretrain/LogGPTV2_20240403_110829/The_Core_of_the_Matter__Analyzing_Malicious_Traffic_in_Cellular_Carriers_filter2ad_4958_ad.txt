### pDNS Dataset and Mobile Device Visits

The pDNS dataset includes visits from mobile devices, which is intriguing as it contains several well-known desktop malware classes, such as Zeus and SpyEye, even in the filtered mobile traffic.

**Figure 9: Volume of Malicious MD5 Evidence**
This figure illustrates the volume of malicious MD5 evidence associated with unique qnames in the m&a dataset after projecting through non-cellular pDNS data collection.

### Google Play and Malware Association

As shown in Figure 8(b), the Android 500 class (Google Play) has the lowest percentage of applications contacting hosts historically associated with malware. Only 10% of the domain names observed in this class have more than one malware sample associated with the host. This number increases when projected through our passive DNS data collection from non-cellular networks using fmal(). However, such indirect results are prone to false positives due to phenomena like parking IPs and sinkholes, which can still trigger analysis by market operators.

### Summary of Internet Infrastructure Usage

Mobile applications from various marketplaces and malware datasets use much of the same Internet infrastructure as non-cellular DNS resolutions. This observation aligns with our previous analysis in Section 5.1.1, which examined DNS traffic from a large cellular provider. Notably, some marketplaces, such as Softandroid, contain mobile applications that are more directly and indirectly related to known malware-tainted hosting infrastructure.

### Mobile Malicious Activity in Cellular Networks

#### 5.2.1 Relationship Between Mobile Platforms and Tainted Hosts
This subsection discusses two related phenomena:
1. The relationship between mobile platforms and requests for tainted hosts.
2. The presence of queries for domains facilitating malware targeting mobile platforms.

#### 5.2.2 Mobile Malware in the Cellular Network
To assess the prevalence of malicious mobile applications in the cellular network, we scanned all cellular network DNS data against a blacklist of 2,932 domains known to be associated with mobile-malware or mobile-malware operators. We focused on 19 unique domains in our cellular pDNS data, which are associated with 10 unique malware families, all of which are Android applications. Nine out of these ten families were publicly disclosed before our study periods, indicating they were queried even after being identified as malicious.

### Prevalence and Impact of Mobile Malware

The most prevalent malicious family was FakeDoc, an adware application that steals user’s Google account and other sensitive information. Despite being flagged by multiple antivirus products, 5,417 devices contacted the domain used by FakeDoc. The second most popular family was NotCompatible, a trojan that acts as an open network proxy, spread through compromised web pages. NotCompatible was disclosed on May 2, 2012.

Overall, the traffic to domains associated with mobile malware is minimal, with only 9,033 devices (0.001%) out of 480 million total devices and 3,492 mobile devices (0.0009%) out of 380 million confirmed mobile devices contacting these domains. This indicates that while mobile malware is a real threat, its impact is currently limited compared to desktop malware. This may be attributed to moderated markets, security architectures, and the relative lack of opportunity for malware authors.

### Conclusion

Mobile malware is a real but minimal threat in the United States, with the overall size of infected populations indicating that it is far from reaching the scope or severity of desktop malware. Market-based kill switches can be effective, but the success of threats like NotCompatible suggests that alternative distribution methods may challenge future control efforts.
