User: I have a wrapper file that is reading a JSON file into a dictionary. 
I am using the os.system("command") command to run a C++ code in this python file. 
The C++ code takes command line inputs which are key values in the parsed dictionary. 
How can i pass a python variable as a command line input for a C++ code using the os.system("command") instruction?
Assistant: You can't do that unless you relax one of the restrictions.
Relax the python dict requirement:  The command line has a well defined text arguments interface, which can easily handle all the info.  You can pass the json filename, the str representation of the dict, or pass name-value pairs as command line arguments. 
Relax the system call requirement: Rather than building an executable from the c++ code, you can build a python c++ extension.  The c++ code can export functions that take a python dict.
Relax the c++ requirement: Obviously you could code it in python.
