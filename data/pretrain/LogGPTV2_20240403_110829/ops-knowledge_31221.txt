User: I have a program in C that communicates via UDP with another program (in Java) and then does process manipulation (start/stop) based on the UDP pkt exchange.
Now this C program has been legacy and I want to convert it to Python - do you think Python will be a good choice for the tasks mentioned?
Assistant: If I was faced with a similar situation I'd ask myself a couple of questions:

Is there anything more important I could be working on?
Does Python bring anything to the table that is currently handled poorly by the current application?
Will this allow me to add functionality that was previously too difficult to implement?
Is this going to disrupt service in any way?

If I can't answer those satisfactorily, then I'd put off the rewrite.
