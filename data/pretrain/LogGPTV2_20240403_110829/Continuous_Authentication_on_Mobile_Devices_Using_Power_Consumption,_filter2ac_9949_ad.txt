### Observations
The values in the tables indicate that user behavior is not consistent across different applications, such as Chrome and Facebook. This inconsistency significantly reduces the identification accuracy when datasets from these applications are mixed. In Figure 7, the ROC curves for the overall system performance on the combined data from both applications, with the context removed, show a noticeable decline in performance.

## 8. Lessons Learned
In real-world data mining, it is common to encounter noisy data. The behavioral biometrics dataset collected for this research is no exception. Despite efforts to control the environment during data collection, the rate of anomalies due to noise is high compared to misclassification errors. 

Most research in continuous authentication uses one of two techniques:
1. **Data Cleansing:** Removing chunks of data whose class predictions contradict the ground truth during training.
2. **Assuming Clean Data:** Considering contradictions as misclassification errors during testing.

However, the nature of the data changes so frequently that it is necessary to model the noise explicitly. This research considered the rate of anomalies generated by a user during testing against their own baseline as a characteristic of their user profile. As seen in Tables 3 and 4, the range of "normal" anomaly rates varies widely among users, indicating the need to build error-aware models.

## 9. Future Work
As discussed in Section 4, the results presented were based on a controlled dataset. A natural next step is to study the impact on performance when volunteers perform their daily routine tasks, which would require longer data collection sessions over multiple days. Additionally, further investigation into the scalability of individualized parameters with an increased number of users, apps, and modalities is warranted. The current testing focused on the efficacy of identifying users through device interactions. Future work will assess the usability of the approach now that its efficacy has been established.

## 10. Conclusion
We have introduced a novel system for authenticating users on Android mobile devices by leveraging three distinct modalities: power consumption, touch gestures, and physical movement (using both accelerometer and gyroscope). To our knowledge, we are among the first to propose using mobile power measurements and application context in the authentication process. By using individualized thresholds for the expected rate of anomalies, we significantly improved performance. We implemented a full set of algorithms and applications for measurement, evaluation, and deployment on a Nexus 5 Android phone, demonstrating real-time continuous authentication.

Using data from 73 volunteer participants, we evaluated our system while they used Chrome and Facebook. We achieved good performance with an equal error rate between 6.1% and 6.9% for 59 selected users who provided sufficient data for evaluation. Given that our approach effectively addresses noise and context, it is more viable as a real-world solution compared to other methods in the literature.
