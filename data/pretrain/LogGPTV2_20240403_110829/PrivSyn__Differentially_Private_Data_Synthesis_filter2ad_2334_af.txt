A Missing Proofs
Proof of Theorem 5: Publishing m InDif scores with
N (0,8m/ρ(cid:48)I) satisﬁes ρ(cid:48)-zCDP.
Proof. The proof is trivial given Lemma 4, Theorem 1 and
Theorem 3: Because the sensitivity of InDif is 4, publishing it
with N (0,8m/ρ(cid:48)I) satisﬁes ρ(cid:48)/m-zCDP. For m InDif scores,
by composition, publishing all of them satisﬁes ρ(cid:48)-zCDP.
Proof of Theorem 6: (1) The marginal M has sensitivity
∆M = 1; (2) Publishing M with noise N (0,1/2ρI) satisﬁes
ρ-zCDP.
Proof. We ﬁrst prove the marginal function has sensitivity 1.
A marginal MA speciﬁed by a set of attributes A is a frequency
distribution table, showing the number of record with each
possible combination of values for the attributes. For two
marginals MA and M(cid:48)
A is obtained by adding or
removing one user to MA. In general, for any A, it is obviously
that ∆M = |M− M(cid:48)|2 = 1.
A, where M(cid:48)
Given this fact, by Theorem 3, it is trivial that adding
N (0,1/2ρI) to a marginal satisﬁes ρ-zCDP.
Proof of Lemma 4: ∆InDif = 4.
Proof. Assume D contains n records and consider the two
attributes a and b. Denote the number of users for histogram
on attribute a as a1,a2, . . ., and b1,b2, . . . for b. For the two-
way marginal on a,b, denote the number of users for it as
α11,α12, . . ..
