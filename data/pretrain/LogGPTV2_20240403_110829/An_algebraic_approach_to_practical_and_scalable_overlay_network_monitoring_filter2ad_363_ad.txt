Table 2: Simulation results for three types of BRITE router topologies: Barabasi-Albert (top), Waxman
(upper middle) and hierarchical model (lower middle), and a real router topology of 284,805 nodes (bottom).
OL gives the number of end hosts on the overlay network. AP shows the number of links after pruning (i.e.,
remove the nodes and links that are not on the overlay paths). MPR (monitored path ratio) is the fraction
of the total end-to-end paths which we monitor. FP is the false positive rate.

For all topologies in Sec. 7.2, we achieve high loss rate es-
timation accuracy. Results for the Bernoulli and the Gilbert
models are similar. Since the Gilbert loss model is more re-
alistic, we plot the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs)
of absolute errors and error factors with the Gilbert model
in Fig. 5. For all the conﬁgurations, the absolute errors
are less than 0.008 and the error factors are less than 1.18.
Waxman topologies have similar results, and we omit them
in the interest of space.
The lossy path inference results are shown in Table 2. No-
tice that k is much smaller than the number of IP links that
the overlay network spans, which means that there are many
IP links whose loss rates are unidentiﬁable. Although diﬀer-
ent topologies have similar asymptotic regression trend for k
as O(n log n), they have diﬀerent constants. For an overlay
network with given number of end hosts, the more IP links
it spans on, the bigger k is. We found that Waxman topolo-
gies have the largest k among all synthetic topologies. For
all conﬁgurations, the lossy path coverage is more than 96%
and the false positive ratio is less than 8%. Many of the false
positives and false negatives are caused by small estimation
errors for paths with loss rates near the 5% threshold.
We also test our algorithms in the 284,805-node real router-
level topology from [25]. There are 65,801 end host routers
and 860,683 links. We get the same trend of results as il-
lustrated in Fig. 5 and Table 2. The CDFs include all the
path estimates, including the monitored paths for which we
know the real loss rates. Given the same number of end
hosts, the ranks in the real topology are higher than those
of the synthetic ones. But as we ﬁnd in Sec. 4, the growth
of k is still bounded by O(n).
7.4 Results for Different Link Loss Rate
Distribution and Running Time
We have also run all the simulations above with model
LLRD2. The loss rate estimation is a bit less accurate than
it is under LLRD1, but we still ﬁnd over 95% of the lossy
paths with a false positive rate under 10%. Given space
limitations, we only show the lossy path inference with the
Barabasi-Albert topology model and the Gilbert loss model
in Table 4.
The running time for LLRD1 and LLRD2 are similar,
as in Table 4. All speed results in this paper are based on
a 1.5 GHz Pentium 4 machine with 512M memory. Note
that it takes about 20 minutes to setup (select the mea-
surement paths) for an overlay of 500 end hosts, but only
several seconds for an overlay of size 100. The update (loss
rate calculation) time is small for all cases, only 4.3 seconds
for 124,750 paths. Thus it is feasible to update online.

the same Barabasi-Albert topologies as in Table 2.
Refer to Table 2 for statistics like rank. FP is the
false positive rate. OL means overlay network.
7.5 Results for Measurement Load Balancing
We examine the measurement load distribution for both
synthetic and real topologies, and the results are shown in
Table 3. Given the space constraints, we only show the
results for Barabasi-Albert and hierarchical model. Our load
balancing scheme reduces CV and MMR substantially for
all cases, and especially for MMR. For instance, a 500-node
overlay on a 20000-node network of Barabasi-Albert model
has its MMR reduced by 7.3 times.
We further plot the histogram of measurement load dis-
tribution by putting the load values of each node into 10
equally spaced bins, and counting the number of nodes in
each bin as y-axis. The x-axis denotes the center of each
bin, as illustrated in Fig. 6. With load balancing, the his-
togram roughly follow the normal distribution. In contrast,
the histogram without load balancing is close to an expo-
nential distribution. Note that the y-axis in this plot is
logarithmic: an empty bar means that the bin contains one
member, and 0.1 means the bin is empty.

7.6 Results for Topology Changes
We study two common scenarios in P2P and overlay net-
works: end hosts joining and leaving as well as routing
changes. Again, the Bernoulli and the Gilbert models have
similar results, thus we only show those of the Gilbert model.

Table 6: Simulation results for deleting end hosts on
a real router topology. FP is the false positive rate.
Denoted as “-reduced value (total value)”.
For the real router topology, we start with an overlay net-
work of 40 random end hosts. Then we randomly add an end
host to join the overlay, and repeat the process until the size
of the overlay reaches 45 and 50. Averaged over three runs,
the results in Table 5 show that there is no obvious accuracy
degradation caused by accumulated numerical errors. The
average running time for adding a path is 125 msec, and for
adding a node, 1.18 second. Notice that we add a block of
paths together to speedup adding node (Sec. 3.2).
