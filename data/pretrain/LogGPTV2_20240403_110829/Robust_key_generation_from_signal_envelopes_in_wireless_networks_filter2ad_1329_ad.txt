bits to remove). In the proof of the following lemma we rely
on the leftover hash lemma [33] to implement the extractor
H:
Lemma 3.7. Suppose that hρA, ρB, ρCi is distributed ac-
cording to Env. Assume that with probability 1− 1, ρA con-
tains t runs and ρB contains t runs that shifted either left or
right by an amount of s time slots. Then there is a way to
implement hGen, Repi as above so that it is a (n, l0, 1, 2)-
SFIR with l0 = Dn,t,s + 2 − 2 log(1/2).
Based on any SFIR (Gen, Rep), we deﬁne the following
key-generation system:
Key Generation System based on a SFIR (Gen, Rep).
(1) The sender A will apply Gen to the random variable
ρA to obtain a pair of strings hf, pi; it will set key = f .
(2) the sender A will transmit to the receiver B the value
p.
(3) the receiver B employs the function Rep and his read-
ing of the envelope ρB to recover key = f .
Based on the SFIR properties we can easily show the fol-
lowing theorem:
Theorem 3.8. Given a (n, l0, 1, 2)-SFIR for the enve-
lope distribution hρA, ρB, ρCi, the protocol KG described above
is a (n, l0, 1, 2, 0)-key-generation system for the distribu-
tion Env = hρA, ρB, ρCi.

ceived signal strength at both sides of the commu-
nication channel after applying a low pass ﬁlter.
The low pass ﬁlter is used to reduce the noise.
Example Implementation. Using the lemma 3.6, we have
that for t = 38, n = 2000, s ≤ 4 it holds that the min en-
tropy is D2000,38,4 = 191. Based on the leftover hash lemma
[33] we can obtain a key that is of length l0 = 81 bits that
will have distance less than 2−56 from the uniform distribu-
tion over {0, 1}l0 . Note that instantiating the leftover-hash-
lemma is very simple (e.g., using linear mappings over ﬁnite
ﬁelds, cf. [34]); it follows that the computational cost of the
key-generation of this section is minimal.
Finally note that the parameters used in this example are
consistent with the simulation results that we present in the
next section (that dictate a fade rate of 19/1000 and a bound
of s that is less than 4).
4. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section we provide a simulated realization of two
nodes transmitting signals through a Rayleigh fading chan-
nel, each receiving their own version of the signal, and ex-
tracting a bit vector from it. We then compare the two vec-
tors to each other and show that with overwhelming proba-
bility the errors introduced in the communication links will
be correctable based on our procedure that we described in
3.2.

5. CONCLUSIONS
We simulate a communication system with a Rayleigh fad-
ing channel, that both legitimate nodes experience. From
each one’s perception of a signal transmitted through this
channel, they will generate their own bits streams. The pa-
rameters of this channel are:
(1) BPSK communication with the bit rate of 1 Mbps.
(2) SINR of 25 dB (equivalent to a BER of 10−5 for a
multi-path fading channel).
(3) Doppler shift of 1 Hz.
(4) To reduce the eﬀect of noise in estimating the bit
streams at both sides of the channel, we ﬁltered the
received signal with a narrow low pass ﬁlter with a
bandwidth of 100 Hz. Using a very narrow ﬁlter has
the beneﬁt of reducing the noise dramatically. Fig-
ure 4 shows the received signal strength of both sides
of the communication channel after the low pass ﬁlter
has been applied.
Note that in key generation we are only interested in esti-
mating the received signal strength and not the actual trans-
mitted bits. Also note that the Doppler frequency is in the
order of a few Hz (at most 20 Hz for very fast changing en-
vironment), therefore, a narrow band ﬁlter with bandwidth
of 100 Hz is enough to capture the signal ﬂuctuation due to
the change in the environment.
4.2 Generating bit streams
To generate bit streams in each side of the channel, each
node samples the output of its low pass ﬁlter and compares
it with a set threshold. Figure 5 shows the generated bits
at both nodes when the threshold is set to -5 dB. As can
be seen from the ﬁgure, the two generated sequences are
very similar, in spite of the fact that each node experienced
its own levels of interference and neither communicated with
each other any decision regarding the generation of these bit
streams. The only occasional diﬀerences occur when there
is a transition from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 — that is, at the edge of
a deep fade. These mismatches between the sequences are
due to many reasons, including the diﬀerent timing between
the two nodes (since there is a slot delay between each one’s
transmission) and each node’s distinct interference and noise
that passes through its low pass ﬁlter.
Note that Figure 5 depicts the raw output of the low pass
ﬁlter and threshold detector, without engaging in any afore-
mentioned techniques to match the two bit vectors up.
For the setup in this simulation, from a study of 100 sec-
onds, deep fades occur with an average rate of 19 per one
thousand bits4. This means that for n = 1000, the resulting
number of fades is t = 19. Note that this simulation, using
an actual Rayleigh fading channel, shows that k, the length
of the run of 1s due to a deep fade, is a random variable, as
was detailed in Section 2.2.
Hence these results conﬁrm that even in the presence of
interference in a wireless network with time division duplex
(TDD) for communication, the similarity between envelopes
of the transmitter and receiver is enough to obtain equal
keys for both.
4The statistical data is extracted from long runs of the sim-
ulation explained in this section. The ﬁgures only show a
portion of these runs, for visual clarity.
In this paper, we have introduced a novel method that
uses physical layer characteristics of a wireless channel for
generating a secret key between a pair of nodes in a wireless
ad-hoc network.
Using the channel reciprocity and deep fades, our algo-
rithms enable key agreement for a strong cryptographic key
without the need of resorting to traditional key exchange
cryptographic algorithms. The shared source of randomness
between two nodes is the wireless channel which is unique
to them. Given the lightweight computational requirements
of our second procedure of section 3.2, it follows that rela-
tively eﬀortlessly the two wireless nodes can create a shared
strong key that can be used for subsequent cryptographic
operations.
We note that no special hardware is required for our tech-
niques and a narrow-band ﬁlter along with a threshold de-
tector are suﬃcient. The presence of a narrow-band ﬁlter
before the threshold detector dramatically reduces levels of
interference and noise for generating the bit vector. This
provides robustness for diﬀerent levels of SINR that permit
communication between the two nodes. Our technique is
also robust to channel estimation noise, since it is based on
detecting deep fades, and not the complete channel impulse
response which tolerates estimation errors, that may arise at
the edges of deep fades and are shown to be correctable. Fi-
nally, in case the nodes move, their signal envelopes change
which increases the entropy and can give rise to key gener-
ation at a quicker pace. If the nodes are stationery it may
still be possible for the nodes to introduce interference on
purpose so a key may be spawned.
It should be stressed
that security of our key generation mechanisms is not based
on computational intractability assumptions such as those
used to argue about security in schemes such as theˆEDiﬃe
Hellman key-exchange. For example, the key produced from
our second procedure as detailed in section 3.2 is informa-
tion theoretically secure for an adversary that is oblivious to
the location of the deep fades (but still knows the number
of them).
