This more a suggestion than an issue.  
I used the SAOPass and SSAOPass examples in my code and we have skinned meshes
in the scene(only skinned meshes).  
For this postprocessing effect to work I had to manually set `.skinning =
true` on all the shader pass' internal materials(like the depth material). It
was probably overkill, maybe only some of them needed this setting.  
If I don't do this the internal render targets of the shader pass are not
updated as the mesh moves/animates and you get a ghost effect.  
It would be nice if this was a parameter of the shader pass constructor.
