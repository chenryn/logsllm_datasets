You should now have an OSINT VM which is ready for the Advanced Linux techniques discussed much later 
in the book. It will be convenient to maintain a single OSINT VM which is applicable to this entire book instead 
of "Basic” and "Advanced" versions. We have a lot to get through before we are ready for the advanced section, 
but we will be able to pick up where we left off without any additional installation or configuration. We can 
focus only on the usage of these tools without redundant explanation of script creation, icon placement, and 
desktop shortcuts.

Now that your VM contains numerous custom scripts and applications, you may want to customize the 
appearance. You could open the Applications menu, right-click on each new OSINT shortcut, and add them to 
your Dock, but that is very time-consuming. The following commands change the background; clear the entire 
Dock; adjust the Dock position; place all desktop shortcuts within your Dock for easy access; and decrease the

While this chapter has abbreviated the steps to build your own OSINT VM, you may still feel overwhelmed 
with the required effort. In late 2019, my colleague Jesse created a single script which replicates even’ step we 
have discussed up to this point, including the advanced OSINT Linux tools coming up later. I modified this 
script to include every’ Linux configuration, installation, and customization mentioned throughout this entire 
book. After you build your Ubuntu virtual machine within VirtualBox by conducting the steps previously 
explained, launch the following two commands from within Terminal. You will be prompted to enter your 
password at least once. After the process completes, you possess the same machine which was built during the 
tutorials throughout this entire book.

Assume that you have not touched your OSINT Original virtual machine in some time, and you are ready to 
launch a new investigation. You likely have software updates which need to be applied. Instead of cloning and 
updating ever}' machine, launch your OSINT Original VM and conduct the following within Terminal. These 
commands will update your operating system, installed applications, and custom programs created during thr 
previous chapter.
I encourage you to ignore this script until you have confidence in your ability to create your virtual machine 
manually. I find it more satisfying to use a VM which I created myself instead of one generated by an automated 
script, but I want you to have options. If this script should fail on your VM, revert to the manual methods in 
order to identify the issue.
An ideal scenario would be that you are already familiar with the VM creation and configuration process, but 
you do not have a configured VM from which to clone. You have an Ubuntu VM, but no OSINT applications. 
Entering these two commands within the Terminal of any Ubuntu installation should build your OSINT VM in 
about 10 minutes. This script could also be launched from an Ubuntu host. If you had an old laptop with no 
other purpose, you could install Ubuntu as the host operating system and run this script.
If you look at the script after download, which should be available within your "Home” folder inside your 
Ubuntu install, you will see that it appears very similar to the text file with all of the Linux commands 
(https://intcltechniques.com/osintbook9/linux.txt). This new script is simply executing each line as we did 
manually throughout the book. While it can be a valuable time saver, you also risk missing any errors which 
occur during execution.
You may feel frustrated with me. You may wonder why I did not start the book with this script. While I rely on 
this single script often, it is cheating. Running a single command and achieving a complete VM is convenient 
and time-saving, but it also eliminates any need to understand the processes. I believe the education received 
while manually building an OSINT VM is more valuable than the final product itself. However, this automated 
script simplifies the process when we need to quickly create another OSINT VM. It also allows me to apply 
updates as needed from my end. You could launch this script a year after reading the book and immediately 
apply all updates and changes which have occurred since publication.

You should now have a completely functional and updated virtual machine titled "OSINT Original". This is 
your clean machine with no contamination from any investigation or testing. It has all the software we want, 
and it is ready to be used. Next, let's consider an "OSINT Test" machine. This is the VM on which you can 
practice Linux commands, test new programs, or create new scripts. It is a VM which will never be used for any 
investigations. Its sole purpose is to give you a safe playground to experiment. Complete the following tasks 
within VirtualBox.
1 believe these update commands should be executed as often as possible. You always want your OSINT 
Original VM to have the latest software. Manually entering each of these commands on a daily or weekly basis 
is exhausting. This is why 1 have created a script to update everything we have installed in our OSINT Original 
VM. This file is included within the scripts folder of the Linux "vm-files" archive previously downloaded, and 
the content can be seen by opening "updates.sh" within your Ubuntu VM. You can launch this file by clicking 
the "Update Scripts" application in the Applications menu or Dock of your OSINT Original VM. Look for the 
circular arrow icon in the lower Dock next to the Terminal icon.
