User: Git pull appears "fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories" error, how to solve it?
Assistant: This error may be caused by merging two disjoint branches, which can be solved by the following methods: 1. Add the --allow-unrelated-histories option after the Git pull command: ``` git pull origin master --allow-unrelated -histories ``` 2. First execute the following command: ``` git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories ``` Then execute the following command: ``` git merge origin/master --allow-unrelated-histories ` `` 3. If it is a new warehouse, you can try to create an empty commit locally: ``` git commit --allow-empty -m "Initial commit" ``` and then execute the Git pull command: ``` git pull origin master ```
