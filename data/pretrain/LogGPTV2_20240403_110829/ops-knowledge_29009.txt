User: I started programing a game on a Mac. Then, I brought the same EXACT code to another Mac. 
I got many, many different errors with Pygame saying it wasn't installed, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS! 
Anyway, I fixed those errors, then I went to go run the module and the window appeared then it crashed and gave me this message: 

IDLE's subprocess didn't make connection. Either IDLE can't start a
  subprocess or personal firewall software is blocking the connection

I never got this message before. However, it continues to crash. I have killed idle using the Activity Monitor. There weren't any files in the directory. I have deleted all of the Python files that I have created.
Trashed every .pyc file. The Mac I am using is on El Captain; Python is at 2.7.12. Like I said, the code has not changed AT ALL from the first computer.
However, games that are pre-installed with IDLE work perfectly. I have moved the program to the same folders as the games. I copied the content from my program to another file, still nothing.
All help is appreciated, thank you :)
Assistant: The most likely reason that your getting this error, is because you're
not the administrator of the computer and you're trying to run a script from your local disk. There are a few things that you could do to solve this.
1. Move the .py file:
Before jumping to the method below, simply try moving your python file to a different location on your drive. Then try running the script with the python IDLE. If Your script still won't run, or you must have the script on your local drive, see the second method below
2. Run the script from the command prompt\terminal:
To run the script from your command prompt\terminal, first find the path to your python executable. In my case mine is:

C:\Users[insert user name here]\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35\python.exe

Copy and paste the entire path this into your command prompt\terminal window. Next, find the path to your python file. For an example, the path to my script is:

C:\test.py

It is important to note that your path to your python executable cannot contain spaces.
Next copy and paste the path tot your python file into your command prompt\terminal window. When finished, the command your made should like something like this:

C:\Users[insert user name here]\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35\python.exe  C:\test.py

Next press enter, and watch your python script run.
