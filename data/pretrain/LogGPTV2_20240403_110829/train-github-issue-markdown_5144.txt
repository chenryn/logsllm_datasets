Hi
I am using the Breevy (from http://www.16software.com) text expander for many
things, including documentation, and it doesn't go well with vsCode.
The expander has 2 operating modes, one where it simulates key presses, and
one where it uses the clipboard, simulating a cut/paste operation to insert
text in the current application.
Works fine for while on anything I've been using, however the shortcuts are
not expanded inside vsCode
I have tested with the Markdown editor and on a generic file, simply doing
Ctrl+N to have a new edit window opened.
What happens is that the abbreviation seems to be recognized, as it's removed
from the screen, but the expanded text is not inserted instead. Tried to
change the shortcuts to avoid special chars, such as $ or =, same results.
This on win 7, 64 bits. VsCode 0.10.2.
Cheers
