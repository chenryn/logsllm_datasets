User: Supposedly Python 2.7 is included native to OSX 10.8 and above (if I remember correctly), but I recently installed Python 3.5 to use for projects while I work through UDacity. Lo and behold, the UDacity courses seem to use 2.7 - wups! So instead of trying to uninstall 3.5 (this procedure seemed to scary for neophytes such as myself), I simply installed 2.7 in addition to the recently installed 3.5 and just run the 2.7 IDLE and Shell. Is this ok, or will I run into problems down the road?
Assistant: Im not sure about OSX, but with windows 10 my environment variables for 2.7 were overwritten with the 3.5 path. Not a tough fix, but a little confusing, since it was months later when I needed 2.7 again.
