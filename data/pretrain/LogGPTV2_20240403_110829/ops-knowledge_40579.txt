It is correct that Python 2.7 comes pre-installed on macOS 10.8 and above, although it's important to note that support for Python 2.7 has ended, and it is recommended to use Python 3.x for new projects. 

You mentioned that you installed Python 3.5 to work through Udacity courses, but the courses are using Python 2.7. Instead of uninstalling Python 3.5, you decided to install Python 2.7 as well and use the IDLE and Shell for Python 2.7 when needed. This approach is generally fine and should not cause any significant issues, provided you manage your environment correctly.

However, you might encounter some challenges if both versions of Python are in your system's PATH. In such a case, the version that appears first in the PATH will be the one executed by default. To avoid confusion, you can specify the full path to the Python executable when running scripts, or use virtual environments to isolate your project dependencies.

For example, you can use `python2.7` or `python3.5` to explicitly call the desired version, or create virtual environments with tools like `virtualenv` or `venv` to ensure that each project uses the appropriate Python version.

Regarding the comment about Windows 10, it is possible that installing a new version of Python can overwrite the environment variables, leading to the default Python version being changed. If this happens, you can manually update the PATH to include the directories for both versions of Python, ensuring that the order reflects your preferred default version.

In summary, having both Python 2.7 and 3.5 installed is acceptable, but make sure to manage your environment carefully to avoid conflicts.
