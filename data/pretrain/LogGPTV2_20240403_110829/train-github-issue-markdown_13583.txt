## Steps to Reproduce

I have encountered an issue with a form on a page where the keyboard disappears after tapping into the form. All fields and buttons remain visible, but the keyboard briefly flashes on the screen and then vanishes.

I have tried two basic widget layouts:

### Layout 1
```dart
return Form(
  key: _formKey,
  child: SingleChildScrollView(
    child: BlockBody(
      children: [
        TextField(...),
        TextField(...),
        RaisedButton(...)
      ],
    ),
  ),
);
```

### Layout 2
```dart
return Form(
  key: _formKey,
  child: Column(
    children: [
      TextField(...),
      TextField(...),
      RaisedButton(...)
    ],
  ),
);
```

These widgets are used as the body of a `Scaffold` widget within a `StatefulWidget`.
