## Steps to Reproduce
I've got a form on a page that seems to have issues with the keyboard
disappearing after tapping into the form. All of the field and button remain
visible when the keyboard flashes on the screen.
I've tried two basic Widget layouts:
    return new Form(
             key: _formKey,
             child: new SingleChildScrollView(
                child: new BlockBody(
                  children: [
                    new TextField( ... ),
                    new TextField( ... ),
                    new RaisedButton( ... )
                  ]
                )
              )
          );
and
    return new Form(
             key: _formKey,
             child: new Column(
                  children: [
                    new TextField( ... ),
                    new TextField( ... ),
                    new RaisedButton( ... )
                  ]
              )
          );
Those widgets are used as the body of a Scaffold widget in a StatefulWidget.
