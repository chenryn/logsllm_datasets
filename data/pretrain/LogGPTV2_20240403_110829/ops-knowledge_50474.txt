User: I have a GNU C++ program and a python script that need to pass strings to each other quite frequently (~70-80 messages a minute). They will run local to each other in CentOS (hosted in the same environment). It feels that although TCP/IP can and will get the job done, what other options do I have?
Keep in mind that I cannot turn my C++ program into a SO and integrate it into my python script using ctypes, my C++ program must be compiled in 32bit, and my python script must be 64bit.
Assistant: If you already have a TCP or UDP server, the easiest way will probably be to switch to UNIX domain sockets.
They come in "stream" and "datagram" modes, just like TCP/UDP sockets, and they're always local, as they use the filesystem namespace (instead of port numbers like TCP/UDP).
