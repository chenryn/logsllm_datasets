**Subject: Installing Python Development Files on a Custom-Built Embedded Linux System**

Hi Tom,

I understand that you need to install `python-dev` on your embedded Linux machine, which is running Python 2.7.2. The Linux distribution is a custom build by TimeSys, and the kernel version is:

```
Linux hotspot-smc 2.6.32-ts-armv7l-LRI-6.0.0 #1 Mon Jun 25 18:12:45 UTC 2012 armv7l GNU/Linux
```

Since your platform lacks a package manager like `yum` or `apt-get`, and you prefer not to install one, I will provide guidance on how to obtain and compile the necessary development files.

### Does `python-dev` Contain C/C++ Code?

Yes, `python-dev` (or `python-devel` in some distributions) contains C/C++ code. Specifically, it includes header files and a static library that are required for compiling Python extensions written in C or C++.

### Can I Download the `python-dev` Source Code as a `.tar.gz` File for Direct Compilation?

The `python-dev` package itself is not a standalone source package but rather a collection of development files that come with the Python installation. To get these files, you can download the full Python source code, which includes the necessary headers and libraries.

#### Steps to Download and Compile Python 2.7.2:

1. **Download the Python 2.7.2 Source Code:**
   You can download the Python 2.7.2 source code from the official Python website:
   ```
   wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.2/Python-2.7.2.tgz
   ```

2. **Extract the Source Code:**
   ```
   tar -xzf Python-2.7.2.tgz
   cd Python-2.7.2
   ```

3. **Configure the Build:**
   You can configure the build to include the development files. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed (e.g., `gcc`).
   ```
   ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
   ```

4. **Compile and Install:**
   ```
   make
   sudo make altinstall
   ```

   The `make altinstall` command installs Python without overwriting the existing system Python.

5. **Locate the Development Files:**
   After installation, the development files (headers and libraries) will be located in `/usr/local/include/python2.7` and `/usr/local/lib`.

### Summary

- `python-dev` contains C/C++ code, including headers and a static library.
- You can download the full Python 2.7.2 source code and compile it to get the necessary development files.
- Follow the steps above to download, extract, configure, compile, and install Python 2.7.2 on your embedded system.
