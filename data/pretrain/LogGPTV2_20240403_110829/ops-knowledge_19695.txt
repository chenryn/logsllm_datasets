Question: A security architect is designing a new cloud-based application that handles sensitive credential data. To mitigate the risk of credential theft via software exploitation, which of the following techniques should be considered? Furthermore, what could be a potential limitation of the chosen technique?
"A": "Utilizing exploit protection tools like Windows Defender Exploit Guard (WDEG), with the limitation that they may not work for software targeted for defense evasion.",
"B": "Applying network segmentation to restrict lateral movement, potentially limiting the ease of administrative tasks across the network.",
"C": "Enforcing mandatory access controls on all system operations, which could potentially lead to a higher rate of false positives.",
"D": "Requiring biometric authentication for all users, which could be limited by the physical presence requirement for user authentication."
Answer: A
