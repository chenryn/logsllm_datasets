of the line formed by them. Therefore, multiple pairs offer multi-
ple directions in which we can measure moving distances. Fig. 3
illustrates several examples of antenna arrays. As shown in Fig.
3a, a two-element array (or any linear array) only supports two
directions in a line. With three antennas arranged in a triangle (Fig.
3b), we can track motion along three lines (each with two moving

tractable directions at most, respectively.
directions). By adding one more antenna to form a quadrangle (Fig.
3c), we obtain 6 antenna pairs, providing at most 12 directions.
Ideally, m antennas will form m∗(m−1)/2 lines in 2D space, each
corresponding to a pair of antennas, yielding m ∗(m − 1) supported
directions that lead to an orientation resolution of 2π/(m ∗(m − 1)).
Practically, however, the resolution will be lower since some pairs
may be parallel with each other and the corresponding directions
become the same. For example, a square array of 4 antennas only
has 8 directions, while ideally, a quadrangular array supports 12
directions (Fig. 3c). Fortunately, those parallel antenna pairs can be
leveraged for augmented alignment to facilitate distance and angle
measurement, as will be detailed later in Section 4.2.
The angle of rotation for angular motion is derived differently
from the heading direction. For linear motion in a specific direction,
only several pairs (at most 3 in the hexagonal case) of antennas
would be aligned. Differently, in the presence of rotation, every
adjacent pair will be aligned at the same time since all of them move
along the same circle. As a consequence, we can sense rotation by
detecting concurrent alignment between all adjacent antennas, and
further calculate the rotating angle.
Hexagonal array: In principle, the more antennas are available,
the finer distance and orientation resolution we can have. In this
paper, considering that most COTS WiFi radios are equipped with
3 antennas, we prototype RIM with a hexagonal array built from
two COTS WiFi cards2, as shown in Fig. 2. Such an array provides
12 different directions in total and thus an orientation resolution of
30◦. For each possible direction, there will be at least two pairs of
antennas being aligned, making the estimation more robust (§4.2).
Note that our hexagonal design does not require cumbersome
phase synchronization across multiple antennas or between the two
WiFi NICs (§3.2). We also remark that RIM generally applies to dif-
ferent antenna arrays, especially the upcoming WiFi chipsets with
more antennas and shorter wavelengths, which will immediately
offer a better resolution in both distance and orientation.
3.2 Super-resolution Antenna Alignment
To put the idea of STAR into practice, however, is a highly challeng-
ing task that requires to accurately pinpoint a space-time point that
two virtual antennas are aligned with each other, at sub-centimeter
precision.
2We term this design as hexagonal array instead of the commonly used uniform
circular array since it is a physical combination of two arrays rather than a regular
phased array.

This task might seem similar to but significantly differs from
traditional fingerprint matching [30]. In particular, previous fin-
gerprinting (1) needs a priori calibration, (2) requires CSI to be
unique over the whole space and stable over a long time, and (3)
usually accumulates a number of training samples. In contrast, RIM
requires no calibration and consumes only channel measurements
in a narrow space (e.g., a few centimeters) and in a transient period
(e.g., within 0.5 second). Besides, RIM needs to align two individual
antennas, each with only one single channel measurement and
expects the largest similarity (meaning that the two antennas are
best aligned) to be only observed by the measurements recorded by
the two antennas at the same space location, with a millimeter-level
resolution.
We introduce two techniques to achieve sub-centimeter resolu-
tion in RIM: (1) a similarity measure, i.e., Time-Reversal Resonating
Strength (TRRS), for channel samples inspired by the time-reversal
focusing effects [17], and (2) an approach to exploit a large number
of virtual antennas as a virtual massive array for alignment. In the
following, we first present a primer on time-reversal focusing effect,
followed by the definition of TRRS and then the enhancement by
virtual massive antennas.
Time-reversal focusing effects: Time reversal is a physics phe-
nomenon that the energy of the transmitted signal will be focused
in both space and time domains when combined with its time-
reversed and conjugated counterpart. It has been studied since the
1950s [3] and later applied to and experimentally verified in the
fields of ultrasonics, acoustics, light, and electromagnetism [17, 18].
To put it in the context of the WiFi channel, the received CSI,
when combined with its time-reversed and conjugated counterpart,
will add coherently at the intended location but incoherently at any
unintended location, creating a spatial focusing effect as has been
analyzed in [39, 46]. This explains, fundamentally, why multipath
profiles using CSI can underpin high-resolution location distinction
[5]. Therefore we introduce TRRS, a metric that quantifies the time-
reversal focusing effect, as the similarity measure for CSI as follows.
Time-reversal resonating strength: The TRRS between two Chan-
nel Impulse Responses (CIRs) h1 and h2 is defined as [39]
(cid:16) maxi
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:0)h1 ∗ g2(cid:1)[i](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:17)2
,
κ(h1, h2) =
⟨h1, h1⟩⟨g2, g2⟩
(1)
where ∗ denotes linear convolution, ⟨x, y⟩ is the inner product
between vector x and y, and g2 is the time-reversed and conjugated
version of h2, i.e., g2[k] = h∗
In practice, the frequency domain Channel Frequency Response
(CFR) is more often used. Equivalently, the TRRS in Eqn. 1 can be
expressed for two CFRs H1 and H2 as:
|H
1 H2|2
H
2[T − 1 − k], k = 0, 1, . . . ,T − 1.
(2)
⟨H1, H1⟩⟨H2, H2⟩ .
If H1 and H2 are both normalized, then the TRRS becomes the
square of their inner product, i.e., κ(H1, H2) = |H
1 H2|2. Obviously,
H
κ(H1, H2) ∈ [0, 1], and κ(H1, H2) = 1 if and only if H1 = cH2 where
c (cid:44) 0 is any complex scaling factor. Note that while previously many
heuristic metrics were used to compare CSI, the TRRS exploits the
physics of time-reversal focusing effects in an uncomplicated form.
κ(H1, H2) =
(a) Self-TRRS
(b) Cross-TRRS
Figure 4: Spatial resolution of TRRS. (a) Three antennas are
moving at a constant speed and the TRRS for each antenna with
respect to itself is calculated. As seen, the TRRS drops immediately
(significantly by up to 0.3) when the antenna moves for a few mil-
limeters, and monotonously decreases within a range of about 1 cm.
(b) The spatial decay holds for cross-antenna TRRS, especially with
virtual massive antennas, although the absolute values decrease.
CSI measured on COTS WiFi is well-known to contain phase off-
sets, including carrier frequency offset (CFO), sampling frequency
offset (SFO), and symbol timing offset (STO) due to unsynchronized
transmitters and receivers, in addition to initial phase offset caused
by the phase locked loops. As can be seen from Eqn. 2, the impact of
the annoying initial phase distortion, which could only be manually
calibrated with a wired connection or an external clock previously
[43], is eliminated by taking the absolute value in Eqn. 2. We cal-
ibrate the other linear offsets by using the sanitation approach
employed in [13].
Time-reversal focusing effects will be intensified with larger
bandwidths. To facilitate the robustness and uniqueness of TRRS,
we exploit spatial diversity attributed by multiple transmit antennas
to gain larger effective bandwidth. Specifically, suppose there are N
antennas on the AP. The CSI measured on the ith receive antenna
at time t is Hi(t) = {Hi,1(t), Hi,2(t),· · · , Hi, N (t)} where Hi,k(t)
is the CSI between the ith receive antenna and the kth transmit
antenna. We then take the average TRRS of the ith and jth receive
antenna as
(cid:16)
Hi,k(ti), Hj,k(tj)(cid:17)
.

By the above definition, we avoid the need of synchronizing two an-
tennas, but instead take the average of their individually calculated
TRRS values.
Virtual massive antennas: Mainstream APs only have a few an-
tennas, limiting the resolution and robustness of the average TRRS
in Eqn. 3 to measurement noise. To boost super-resolution align-
ment, we propose to leverage a number of virtual antennas emulated
by the sequence of channel snapshots recorded by a moving an-
tenna, forming a virtual massive antenna array whose size is the
number of channel snapshots. As shown in Fig. 1, we extend the mul-
tipath profile of an antenna i at time t from a single snapshot Hi(t)
to a sequence of samples Pi(t) = [Hi(t + k), k = −V/2,· · · , V/2],
where Hi(t + k) indicates the channel measurement emulating the
virtual antenna set up by antenna i at time t +k, and V is the number
of virtual antennas.

Figure 5: Alignment matrices of a square-shape trajectory.
The aligned pairs of the hexagonal array are 1 vs. 3 followed by 1
vs. 6, and then again 3 vs. 1, 6 vs. 1 in turn. Other pairs in parallel
with one of the above are not shown.
Accordingly, we calculate the TRRS with V virtual massive an-
where Hi(ti −k) and Hj(tj −k) denote the respective virtual antenna
placed at certain space location by the ith and jth antenna at time
ti − k and tj − k. By using the virtual massive antennas, we largely
boost the effective bandwidth of the multipath profile and thus
enhance the time-reversal focusing effect, or equivalently, attain
highly precise antenna alignment. As shown in Fig. 4, the TRRS
touches the maximum only when two antennas are closest to each
other (precisely aligned) and drops even when they are separated
by several millimeters.
TRRS matrix: To pinpoint the precise temporal delay when two
antennas i and j are spatially aligned, we match the multipath
profile of antenna i against those of antenna j throughout a sliding
window. Consider a window of length 2W , the TRRS vector is
calculated as Gij(t) = [κ(Pi(t), Pj(t − l)), l = −W ,· · · ,W ]T where
l denotes the time lags. Thus if the antennas move for a period of
T , we obtain a TRRS matrix
Gij = [Gij(t1) Gij(t2) · · · Gij(tT )].
(5)
Fig. 5 illustrates an example of the TRRS matrix, which is also
termed alignment matrix hereafter. The window length W should
be larger than the expected time delay for two antennas to be
spatially aligned. A larger window will incur higher computation
overhead and is not needed.
In RIM, we calculate such TRRS matrix for every pair of antennas
(Fig. 5). The motion parameters are then estimated by identifying
the aligned pairs from the TRRS matrices and continuously estimat-
ing the time delays, and accordingly the moving speed, as detailed
in the next section.
Deviated retracing: So far we assume that the antenna array is
moving along a certain direction in which at least two antennas will
be well aligned with each other. In practice, however, the device
may be swinging in directions slightly deviated from the exact
aligned line, as shown in Fig. 6a, where the array is moving along
a direction that deviates an angle of α from their aligned direction,
i.e., the horizontal line. Fortunately, we realize that noticeable TRRS
peak still exists, albeit weaker, for two antennas that are close
enough yet not exactly aligned in case of deviation angles. Hence
virtual antenna alignment is still feasible since we only focus on

TRRS peaks. The example shows a forward-then-backward move.
the relative TRRS peaks within a window instead of the absolute
values, circumventing the impacts of reduced TRRS values due to
deviated retracing.
In theory, the width of the TRRS peak without ambiguity is about
δ = 0.2λ [46]. Recall Fig. 4, the TRRS peak without ambiguity is
about δ = 10 mm, in accord with the theoretical value. Thus, given
an antenna separation ∆d, the proposed antenna alignment can
theoretically tolerate a maximum deviation angle of α = arcsin( δ
∆d ),
approximately 24◦ for ∆d = λ2 . As shown in Fig. 6b, real-world
experiments show that RIM can confidently tolerate as large as
15◦ deviation, which suffices to cover the complete 2D plane with
6-element circular array. As a result, RIM can track motions in
any direction within the plane of the antenna array. For the same
reasons, RIM does not require the antenna array to be perfectly
leveled on the same plane. As will be shown in our experiments in
§6, our designed array with imperfections in antenna arrangement
yields good performance.
As shown in Fig. 6a, in case of deviation, the “deviated” antenna
separation becomes ∆d′ = ∆d cos α. Since we have no information
about the deviation angle α in advance, we directly let ∆d′ ≈ ∆d in
