Question: You are reviewing the security of a web application designed to run database backups using a privileged user account. The application uses the following command to initiate the backup and cleanup process:

java
String btype = request.getParameter("backuptype");
String cmd = new String("cmd.exe /K \"c:\util\rmanDB.bat "+btype+"&&c:\utl\cleanup.bat\"")
System.Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd);


What is a potential security risk associated with the above implementation, and how could it be mitigated?
"A": "Risk: The backup operation may fail silently. Mitigation: Implement detailed error logging.",
"B": "Risk: An attacker could inject commands via the backuptype parameter. Mitigation: Validate the backuptype parameter to contain only expected values.",
"C": "Risk: The cleanup.bat script may not execute if rmanDB.bat takes too long. Mitigation: Run cleanup.bat as a scheduled task independent of the backup operation.",
"D": "Risk: The application may consume excessive system resources. Mitigation: Set resource usage limits on the cmd.exe process."
Answer: B
