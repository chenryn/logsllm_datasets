    See here:
    http://golang.org/ref/spec#Method_values
    "As with method calls, a reference to a non-interface method with a pointer
    receiver using an addressable value will automatically take the address of that value:
    t.Mv is equivalent to (&t).Mv."
    I'm pretty sure that should say t.Mp is equivalent to (&t).Mp.
