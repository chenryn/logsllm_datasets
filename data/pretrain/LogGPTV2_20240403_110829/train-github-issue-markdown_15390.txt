Please refer to the following link for more information:
http://golang.org/ref/spec#Method_values

The relevant section states: "As with method calls, a reference to a non-interface method with a pointer receiver using an addressable value will automatically take the address of that value. For example, `t.Mv` is equivalent to `(&t).Mv`."

I believe this should be corrected to state: "For example, `t.Mp` is equivalent to `(&t).Mp`." 

This change would better reflect the context of a method with a pointer receiver.
