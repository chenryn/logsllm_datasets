A compelling argument can be made for the adoption of Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), which is gradually replacing IPv4 as the primary "language" of the Internet. One of the most significant benefits of IPv6 is its ability to address the global shortage of IP addresses. While IPv4 provides approximately 4 billion unique addresses, IPv6 offers a staggering 340 undecillion, or 50 octillion, addresses per person on Earth. However, the chief security enhancement of IPv6—mandatory support for Internet Protocol Security (IPSec)—is, in fact, an optional feature that may not be widely adopted due to convenience factors. Additionally, during the extended transition period, there will be an increased "attack surface" as hackers exploit vulnerabilities in both IPv4 and IPv6.

**Military Doctrine:**
Cyberspace is a new domain of warfare, where computers serve both as weapons and targets. Future military concepts and doctrines must incorporate strategies and tactics for cyber attack and defense. Even the most influential military treatise, Sun Tzu's *Art of War*, struggles to encompass many aspects of cyber warfare. The author identifies ten distinctive characteristics of the cyber battlefield, none of which easily fit into Sun Tzu's paradigm.

**Deterrence:**
Nation-states have two primary deterrence strategies: denial of a threatening technology (e.g., nuclear weapons) and punishment. With cyber weapons, denial is impractical because hacker skills and tools are easily accessible. Retaliation through punishment is the only viable option, but for it to be an effective deterrent, the threat must be credible. The challenges of poor attacker attribution and high attack asymmetry in cyberspace undermine the credibility of deterrence, creating problematic doctrinal questions for military rules of engagement.

**Arms Control:**
In the future, world leaders may negotiate an international treaty on the use of cyber weapons. However, arms control relies on two principles that are difficult to apply in cyberspace: prohibition and inspection. Prohibiting something as nebulous as malicious code is challenging, and even in a malware-free environment, hackers can exploit legitimate access points, such as guessing or stealing passwords. Inspection is also problematic, given the vast amount of data and the number of Internet-connected devices. For example, a USB flash drive can hold up to 256 GB, and in the U.S. alone, there are over 400 million Internet-connected computers.

**Summary of Mitigation Strategies:**

| Strategy | Evaluation |
|----------|------------|
| **IPv6** | Increases attribution by reducing anonymity; IPsec authenticates and encrypts, but is not mandatory; Long and dangerous transition phase. |
| **Art of War** | Sun Tzu's principles are valuable but not perfect; Concepts and laws lag behind technological advancements; Cyber warfare has distinctive characteristics. |
| **Deterrence** | Denial is difficult; Hacker skills are easy to acquire; Punishment lacks credibility; Low attribution and high asymmetry; No direct loss of life. |
| **Arms Control** | Challenging to prohibit what is hard to define; Inspecting cyberspace is difficult; Political will could change the dynamics. |

This chapter summarizes the key concepts and influencing factors in this research. The next chapter will examine the two most important categories—"key cyber attack advantages" and "cyber attack mitigation strategies"—using the DEMATEL method to derive a more precise conclusion via a stronger scientific approach.

**10. Key Findings**

The author will employ the DEMATEL method to analyze the two most important categories of influencing factors in this research—cyber attack advantages and cyber attack mitigation strategies—with the following objectives:

- To understand how the key concepts, both individually and categorically, influence one another.
- To visualize the system they comprise using a causal loop diagram.
- To assess the controllability of the system.
- To prioritize the mitigation strategies for decision-makers based on their impact on reducing cyber attack advantages and positively affecting the overall system of strategic cybersecurity.

**The “Expert Knowledge” Matrix**

Matrix X, depicted in Figure 5, is a DEMATEL “Expert Knowledge” influence matrix that juxtaposes the cyber attack advantages and mitigation strategies according to their level of influence on one another. The advantages are labeled A-E, and the strategies are F-I.

Each individual influence value in the matrix is based on the research presented in this book and the author’s judgment as a subject matter expert with over ten years of experience as a cyber intelligence analyst. The author has published peer-reviewed research examining and evaluating the efficacy of all nine influence factors.

For future research, it is clear that different national contexts will yield different influence estimates, and the dynamic nature of cyberspace will ensure that most, if not all, variables will change over time. Readers are encouraged to tailor the matrix to their needs and to aggregate or disaggregate individual influence factors for more general or specific research goals. The mathematical foundations, however, remain consistent.

| Factor | Direct Influence |

A quick glance at Matrix X shows that the cyber attack advantages are much more influential in this system than the mitigation strategies. The average direct influence strength of the advantages is 24.2, compared to 17 for the mitigation strategies. The attack advantages also possess the overwhelming majority of scoring at the “very high” influence level: 17 to 3. This result aligns with the common perception that cyber attackers have significant advantages over their defensive counterparts.
