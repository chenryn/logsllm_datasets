able argument can be made for Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), which is replacing 
IPv4 as the “language” of the Internet. The first benefit of IPv6 is that it instantly 
solves the world’s shortage of computer addresses.454 However, its chief security 
enhancement – mandatory support for Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) – is in fact 
an optional feature that may not be widely used for reasons of convenience. Fur-
thermore, during the long transition phase ahead, there will be an increased “attack 
surface” as hackers exploit vulnerabilities in both IP languages at once.455
Military doctrine: Cyberspace is a new warfare domain, in which computers are 
both a weapon and a target. Future military concepts and doctrine must find a way 
to encompass cyber attack and defense strategies and tactics. However, even the 
most influential military treatise in history, Sun Tzu’s Art of War, which is renowned 
for its flexibility and adaptability to new means and methods of war, has great dif-
ficulty subsuming many aspects of cyber warfare. The author described ten distinc-
tive characteristics of the cyber battlefield, none of which fits easily into Sun Tzu’s 
paradigm.
Deterrence: There are only two deterrence strategies available to nation-states: de-
nial of a threatening technology (e.g., nuclear weapons) and punishment. With cyber 
weapons, denial is a non-starter because hacker skills and tools are easy to acquire. 
Punishment via retaliation is the only option, but to be an effective deterrent, a 
threat has to be credible. Here again, the challenges of poor attacker attribution and 
high attack asymmetry in cyberspace undermine the credibility of deterrence. Fur-
ther, they create problematic doctrinal questions for military rules of engagement.456
Arms Control: In the future, world leaders may negotiate an international treaty 
on the use of cyber weapons.457 However, arms control relies on two principles that 
are not easy to apply in cyberspace: prohibition and inspection. First, it is difficult 
to prohibit something that is hard to define, such as malicious code. And even in a 
malware-free organization, hackers are adept at using legitimate paths to network 
access, such as by guessing or stealing a password. Second, it is hard to inspect 
something that is difficult to count: a USB Flash drive now holds up to 256 GB or 
454 IPv4 contains around 4 billion IP addresses; IPv6 has 340 undecillion, or 50 octillion IPs for every 
human on planet Earth.

457 Markoff & Kramer, 2009a: Russian negotiators have long argued that an international treaty, similar 
to those that have been signed for WMD, could help to mitigate the cyber threat. In 2009, the U.S. 
was reportedly more willing to discuss this proposal than in the past.

Mitigation Strategy Effectiveness.
This chapter summarized the key concepts, or influencing factors, in this research. 
The next chapter will examine the two most important concept categories – “key 
cyber attack advantages” and “cyber attack mitigation strategies” – with the aid of 
DEMATEL. The goal is to derive a more precise conclusion to this book via stronger 
scientific method.

DATA ANALYSIS AND RESEARCH RESULTS
10. KEY FINDINGS
The author will employ the DEMATEL method to analyze the two most important 
categories of influencing factors in this research – cyber attack advantages and cy-
ber attack mitigation strategies – with four primary objectives in mind:
• to understand how the key concepts in this book, both individually and cat-
egorically, influence one another;
• to visualize the system they comprise with the aid of a causal loop diagram;
• to understand the extent to which the system may be controllable; and
• to prioritize the mitigation strategies for decision makers according to their 
impact on reducing the cyber attack advantages and on positively affecting 
the system of strategic cyber security as a whole.
The “Expert Knowledge” Matrix
Matrix X, depicted in Fig. 5, is a DEMATEL “Expert Knowledge” influence matrix that 
juxtaposes the cyber attack advantages and mitigation strategies according to their 
level of influence on one another. The advantages are lettered A-E, and the strategies 
are F-I.
Each individual influence value in the matrix is based on the research presented 
in this book and on the author’s judgment as a subject matter expert with over ten 
years working as a cyber intelligence analyst. As detailed in the Bibliography, the 
author has published peer-reviewed research examining and evaluating the efficacy 
of all nine influence factors.
For future research purposes, it is clear that different influence estimates will per-
tain in different national contexts, and that the dynamic nature of cyberspace will 
ensure that most if not all the variables will change over time.
The reader is thus encouraged to tailor the matrix to his or her needs and to ag-
gregate or disaggregate individual influence factors for more general or for more 
specific research goals.
The mathematics, however, are well-founded, and remain the same.

Figure 5. 
DEMATEL “Expert Knowledge” Influence Matrix X.
A quick glance at Matrix X shows that it is dominated by the cyber attack advan-
tages, which are much more influential in this system of influences than the mitiga-
tion strategies. The average “direct influence” strength of the advantages is 24.2, 
versus a mitigation strategy average of 17. The attack advantages also possess the 
overwhelming majority of scoring at the “very high” influence level: 17 to 3.
This result appears intuitive. It correlates to the common perception in the world to-
day that cyber attackers have enormous advantages over their cyber defense coun-
terparts.
Fig. 6, below, ranks all factors in Matrix X by the simple addition of their individual 
influence levels, by row. To keep them visually distinct, the advantages are in yellow, 
and the mitigation strategies are colored dark green.
