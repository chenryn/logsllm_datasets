User: For a large distributed system, how to monitor and diagnose? Please provide a plan.
Assistant: For a large-scale distributed system, monitoring and diagnosis are very critical, and the following solutions can be used for monitoring and diagnosis: 1. Establish a centralized monitoring platform to realize real-time monitoring by collecting various performance indicators and status information of the system, for example, using Prometheus, Grafana, Rizhiyi and other tools. 2. Establish a unified log collection mechanism to collect and analyze various levels of events and errors in the system. Tools such as Elasticsearch and Log4j can be used. 3. Perform visual monitoring on the system, such as using Kibana and Grafana to realize visual monitoring, so as to identify problems and exceptions. 4. Use a distributed tracing system for diagnosis, such as using tools such as Pinpoint for distributed tracing and diagnosis. 5. Adopt a distributed fault handling mechanism, such as using container technology such as Kubernetes to achieve self-healing performance and reduce the probability of system failure. 6. Establish a monitoring and alarm mechanism, which can be combined with the monitoring platform and log analysis platform to realize alarm notification and processing. 7. Regularly perform system performance tuning and optimization to improve system stability and reliability, such as load balancing, cache optimization, algorithm optimization, etc., to improve the overall system performance.
