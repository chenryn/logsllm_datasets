User: I just set up a simple virtual server with Debian netinst. Now I want to use the tornado webserver to host a public website. I am quite new to Linux so I don't know how to set up a secure server environment.

Which users do I need to create?
Which config changes do I need to do to get a secure system?
How should I run my tornado server (deamon, init.d, ... I don't know these methods...)?
Are there more things I need to take care of when setting up a server from scratch?

Thanks for help :)
Assistant: You can create www user just as deploying LAMP environment
lock the www user in website directory
Supervisor is a good solution of running several tornado process
You can use nginx as front-end of your tornado server.
