### 4.3.1 Pricing Data for Email Services

We extracted pricing data from the job descriptions of 236 postings on Freelancer.com. The average price for sending 1,000 emails was approximately $5.62, with a median price of $1.00. The prices varied significantly, so we manually reviewed another 100 random postings. This review confirmed a wide range of prices, from as low as $0.06 per 1,000 emails to as high as $5.00 per 1,000 emails.

For further comparison, we posted a job for bulk mailing services involving the delivery of three million emails. We received 10 responses, with five including specific prices. These prices ranged from $0.30 to $2.00 per 1,000 emails, with a median of $0.75 per 1,000 emails.

### 4.3.2 Craigslist Ad Posting

Posting an ad on Craigslist is typically free, but the platform employs measures such as IP rate limiting and CAPTCHAs to restrict the number of ads a single individual can post. In the context of our study, when buyers on Freelancer.com create jobs to "spam" Craigslist, their goal is to have workers repeatedly post ads, usually on a daily basis, to keep their ads at the top of search results.

Our classifier identified 11,190 job postings related to this activity, with 9,096 (81%) containing the service name "Craigslist" or a variation thereof, comprising 1.1% of all jobs on Freelancer.com. Figure 8 shows the prices offered by buyers for a single Craigslist posting (top) and the average number of job posts per day (bottom), both as a function of time. The solid vertical bars represent the 25th to 75th percentile price range, and the dashed vertical lines indicate the dates when Craigslist introduced phone verification for erotic services (March 2008) and other services (May 2008).

The demand for Craigslist ad posting began to grow gradually after these policy changes, while the prices offered by buyers remained relatively stable until mid-2009. However, the demand for phone-verified accounts, which are primarily used for Craigslist, dropped dramatically in mid-2009, despite a rapid increase in the previous year. Despite this, the demand for Craigslist ad posting continued to rise, with prices nearly quadrupling within a year.

To further compare pricing data, we posted a job description on Freelancer soliciting bids for "Experienced Craigslist Posters." We received 10 responses, with three bids ranging from $0.40 to $0.65 per ad. These prices are shown in Figure 8 for comparison and align closely with the prices offered by buyers.

### 4.4 Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

Search engine optimization (SEO) is a multi-billion dollar industry aimed at improving the ranking of websites in search results. "White hat" SEO adheres to the guidelines provided by search engines like Google, while "black hat" SEO exploits indexing and ranking algorithms to attract traffic, often sacrificing relevance.

On Freelancer.com, there are three types of black hat SEO offerings: content generation, link building, and search placement.

#### 4.4.1 Content Generation

Content generation involves creating unique content for sites, often by rewriting existing material or using semi-automated techniques like spinning. Spinning uses structured templates and dictionaries to generate multiple variants of the same content, similar to template-based spam generation techniques.

Figure 9 shows the buyer demand and offered prices over time for article content generation jobs. The demand for articles has grown linearly, with a peak of nearly 3,000 jobs posted in August 2010. Prices for articles have been relatively stable, with buyers offering between $2 and $4 per article.

#### 4.4.2 Experiences Purchasing Articles

To evaluate the quality of articles written by Freelancer workers, we hired ten workers to write six original articles on skin care products. Each article had to be at least 400 words, have a keyword density of at least 2%, and pass the CopyScape plagiarism detection system. Table 7 summarizes the results, showing that the quality of work varied considerably. Some workers met the criteria in most cases, while others failed to meet the length and keyword density requirements. Two articles by one worker did not pass the plagiarism test.

The Fleschâ€“Kincaid Grade Level of the articles indicated a reasonable level of English composition. For comparison, Wikipedia articles on the same topic had a higher grade level, while articles from Cosmopolitan magazine had a lower grade level. This suggests that Freelancer can be a useful source of inexpensive, quality content for SEO purposes.

#### 4.4.3 Link Building

Link building is another common SEO abuse, aimed at increasing the number of backlinks to a page, especially from high PageRank (PR) pages. On Freelancer, this type of job accounts for over 3% of all postings. We categorized link-building tasks into "white hat" and "grey hat." White hat jobs avoid countermeasures like link farms and blacklisted sites, while grey hat jobs are more indiscriminate, such as spamming blogs with embedded links.

Figure 10 shows the median price per backlink offered by buyers, correlated with the PageRank of the page. One buyer offered over $25 per backlink on PR8 pages, while buyers offered nearly $5 per backlink on PR4 pages, the most commonly requested PR.

For grey hat link building, we extracted over 2,000 URLs from job postings and checked their inlinks using Yahoo Site Explorer. Table 8 summarizes the top domain names targeted for greyhat link purchasing, with Blogspot and Wordpress being the most frequently targeted.
