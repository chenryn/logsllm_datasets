We extracted pricing data from the job descriptions
of 236 postings. We averaged these prices and discov-
ered that buyers on Freelancer.com were willing to pay
approximately $5.62 to send 1,000 emails, with a me-
dian price of $1.00. The extracted prices varied wildly;
thus, we manually scanned another 100 random post-
ings. Again, we observed a wide range of prices, from
one buyer willing to pay only $0.06/1,000 emails, to an-
other buyer willing to pay $5.00/1,000 emails.
A ﬁnal point of comparison is our own posting for bulk
mailing services. We posted a job that involved sending
bulk emails to three million individuals and received 10
responses. Of the 10 responses, ﬁve included a price, and
these prices ranged from $0.30 to $2 per 1,000 messages
(with a median of $0.75/1,000 emails).
4.3.2 Craigslist Ad Posting
Posting an ad on Craigslist is typically free, but Craigslist
takes special measures to restrict the number of ads
posted by a single individual (e.g., IP rate limiting,
CAPTCHAs, etc.). In the context of our study, when
Freelancer.com buyers create jobs to “spam” Craigslist,
their goal is to obtain repeated ad postings from workers,
usually on a daily basis. This is done to keep a buyer’s
ads at the top of the search results. Our classiﬁer iden-
tiﬁed 11,190 job postings of this type, 9,096 (81%) of
which contained the service name “Craigslist” or a varia-
tion thereof (in total comprising 1.1% of all jobs on Free-
lancer.com).8
Figure 8 shows the prices offered by buyers for a sin-
gle Craigslist posting (top) and the average number of
job posts per day pertaining to Craigslist ad posting (bot-

ﬁc of reasonable quality (with respect to conversion rate) usually re-
quires site-speciﬁc targeting and additional advertiser-provided mate-
rial (“creatives”).
7While we found several other kinds of spam-like jobs (e.g., bulk
SMS), they did not represent a signiﬁcant fraction of all jobs, and are
not part of our study.
8Classiﬁed ad sites BackPage and Kijiji represented 6.6% and 5.5%
of jobs classiﬁed as ad posting; we chose to focus on Craigslist because
it dominated this job category.
Figure 8: Median monthly prices offered by buyers for each
Craigslist ad posted (top), and the monthly number of posts
(bottom), both as a function of time. The solid vertical price
bars show 25% to 75% price quartiles. The dashed vertical lines

vices (May 2008). The three bids received in response to our

tom). The solid circles indicate monthly median prices,
and the solid bars show the 25% to 75% quartiles of the
prices. In early March 2008, Craigslist added a phone
veriﬁcation requirement for posting in the erotic services
section [4], and later extended the requirement to post-
ing in other parts of the site some time in early May
2008 (both dates indicated with dashed vertical lines in
the graph).
Figure 8 illustrates that the demand for posting to
Craigslist started growing gradually after the policy
changes, and the prices offered by buyers stayed es-
sentially unchanged until mid-2009. Recall that in mid-
2009, demand for phone veriﬁed accounts (which are
dominated by Craigslist) appears to drop dramatically
(Figure 4), having increased rapidly over the past year.
Note, however, that the demand for Craigslist ad post-
ing continues to rise during that same time period, nearly
quadrupling in price within a year.
To further compare pricing data, we posted a job de-
scription on Freelancer soliciting bids for “Experienced
Craigs List Posters.” We received 10 responses, with
three bids of $0.40, $0.60, and $0.65 per ad; these prices
are shown for comparison purposes in the top graph of
Figure 8 as solid triangles on the right edge. These prices
are roughly in accordance with the buyer offers.
4.4 Search Engine Optimization
Search engine optimization (SEO) represents the second
major advertising channel along with spam. SEO is a
multi-billion dollar industry for improving the ranking
of sites and pages returned in search results on popu-
lar search engines. Improving the ranking of pages in
llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll20072008200920102011$0$1.25Offered price per posting0750Volumesearch results increases trafﬁc to that page. “White hat”
SEO improves the search rank of pages while obeying
the guidelines provided by search engine companies like
Google that prevent abuse of the indexing and ranking
algorithms. “Black hat” SEO abuses the indexing and
ranking algorithms, sacriﬁcing the relevance of a page
with the sole goal of attracting trafﬁc via search results.
There are three kinds of black hat SEO offerings
on Freelancer.com, spanning the spectrum from least to
most “ﬁnished”: content generation, link building, and
search placement.
Content generation increases the number of sites that
contain indexable content together with links to a target
page. This goal is achieved either by having writers gen-
erate unique content for sites, often by rewriting existing
material, or by using a semi-automated technique known
as spinning. Spinning often uses structured templates to-
gether with a variety of word, phrase, and sentence “dic-
tionaries” to generate many variants of effectively the
same content, and is analogous to the template-based
techniques used to generate polymorphic spam that can
defeat spam ﬁlters [11].
Link building is a more focused type of SEO job
whose goal is to place links on pages with existing con-
tent, emphasizing placement on pages with high rank as
deﬁned by search engines. Rather than generating and
distributing content across many sites as a basis for im-
proving the ranking of a target page, link building boot-
straps on existing highly-ranked pages.
The most ﬁnished kind of SEO job is search place-
ment. The buyer does not care how the desired search
placement is achieved, only that they place in the top
search results on Google. Such jobs were relatively rare
on Freelancer, and we only survey content generation and
link building jobs in further detail.
4.4.1 Content Generation
A popular form of abusive SEO is to post “articles”
to various sites and forums. These articles contain key-
words and links intended to increase the search engine
PageRank of a page in search results returned from
queries that use the same keywords. With proper ac-
counts (Section 4.1), the posting step can be automated.
However, defenses implemented by search engines can
detect automatically-generated article content. Such de-
fenses have thereby created a demand for human workers
to generate sufﬁciently realistic articles that defeat the
countermeasures. Indeed, such article writing jobs rep-
resent the most popular abusive job category by far, ac-
counting for over 10% of all Freelancer jobs (Table 2).
Article job descriptions request batches of 10–50 ar-
ticles at a time in grammatically correct English on a
particular topic, seek articles typically 250–500 words
in length, and often have a variety of requirements
Figure 9: Median monthly prices offered by buyers for each
article posted (top) and monthly average number of buyer posts
per day (bottom), as a function of time. Vertical price bars show
25% to 75% price quartiles.
that reﬂect perceived countermeasures implemented by
the search engines. A frequent requirement is sufﬁcient
“originality” (albeit often of simply rewritten text) to
pass CopyScape, a popular plagiarism detection tool;
such originality counters the capability of search engines
to detect and discount similar content. Other such re-
quirements request rewritten text beyond straightforward
manipulation of existing content (simple synonym sub-
stitution, transposing sentences, etc.).
Figure 9 shows buyer demand and offered prices over
time for article content generation jobs. Growth in de-
mand for articles has been strong, with the number of
jobs offered increasing linearly, with a peak of nearly
3,000 article jobs posted in August 2010. This substantial
growth in demand strongly suggests that article writing is
indeed an effective form of SEO abuse. Yet prices for ar-
ticles have been relatively stable over the past four years,
with buyers offering $2–4/article.
4.4.2 Experiences Purchasing Articles
To evaluate the quality of the articles written by Free-
lancer workers, we solicited and employed ten workers
to write six original articles on the topic of skin care
products. We required each article to contain at least 400
words, have a keyword density of at least 2%,9 and pass
the CopyScape [5] plagiarism detection system. Table 7
shows the results of this assignment. Workers are identi-
ﬁed by their two-letter country and a digit. In addition to
the three criteria above, we also computed the articles’
Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level [10]—a measure of text
9“Keyword density” is the frequency of occurrence of a set of key-
words provided by the bidder to be included in the text. Keyword den-
sity thresholds ensure that search engines index a Web page with re-
spect to the speciﬁed keywords. In our experiment, we provided work-
ers with keywords such as “dry skin moisturizer” and “exfoliating
scrub”.

Table 7: Quality of articles written by workers on the topic of
skin care products. Columns Len, KD, and CS show how many
of each worker’s six articles failed the length, keyword density,
and CopyScape plagiarism detection requirements. The FKGL
column shows the Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level [10] range of
each worker’s text after excluding their lowest and highest scor-

readability based on word and sentence length, roughly
indicating the school grade level required to comprehend
the text. The FKGL column shows the score range of the
work produced by each worker after excluding their low-
est and highest scoring articles.
Quality of the work produced by the ten workers var-
ied considerably. More than half of the articles produced
by workers IN5, PH1, and BD8 did not meet our 2% key-
word density requirement; in addition, PH1 failed to pro-
duce articles of the required length (400 words). On the
other hand, half of the workers produced articles satisfy-
ing our criteria in at least ﬁve out of six cases. Unfortu-
nately, two of the articles produced by UK2 did not pass
the CopyScape plagiarism detection tool, and as such,
would likely not be indexed by search engines.
Articles written by the workers were understandable
and on topic. The Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level of the ar-
ticles reveals a notable level of English composition. For
comparison, ﬁve Wikipedia articles on the same topic
had scores in the range 12.1 ± 0.5, while six articles
from Cosmopolitan—a popular women’s magazine in
the US—about skin care fell in the 7.9 ± 0.8 range. Thus,
at least with respect to SEO, our results show Freelancer
to be a useful source of inexpensive content that would
be difﬁcult to distinguish mechanically from work pro-
duced by more highly-paid specialist writers.
4.4.3 Link Building
Google reports a PageRank (PR) metric for every page,
accessible via the Google Toolbar. The PR ranges from
0–10, with new and least popular pages having a PR of
Figure 10: Average price buyers offered for backlinks on pages
with a given PageRank (PR). Higher PRs correspond to more
popular (and valuable) pages. The number above the bar corre-
sponds to the number of jobs requesting backlinks of that PR.
0 and the highest ranked pages having a PR of 10. This
PageRank is a combination of the number of sites that
link to the page—so-called backlinks—and the PageR-
anks of the pages with the backlinks. Not surprisingly,
another common SEO abuse is to increase the number of
sites that backlink to a page, and to have those backlinks
on sites with high PageRank.
Hiring people to perform this kind of SEO task is
another frequent kind of abusive job on Freelancer, ac-
counting for over 3% of all jobs. We placed such link-
building tasks into two categories, “white hat” and “grey
hat”. White hat link building jobs have requirements that
speciﬁcally try to avoid search engine countermeasures,
such as no link farms, no blacklisted sites, no redirects or
JavaScript links, links on sites with generic top-level do-
mains, and so on. Jobs also specify the PageRank of the
pages on which the backlinks will be placed, and that the
buyer will validate the links created according to all of
their criteria. Grey hat link building is much more indis-
criminate, such as spamming blogs with links embedded
in comments.
How much do people value backlinks as an SEO tech-
nique? The job postings quantify this value in economic
terms. For the “white hat” link building jobs for which
we could automatically extract pricing data, Figure 10
shows that the median price per backlink buyers offered
is directly correlated with the PageRank (PR) of the page
containing the backlink. One buyer offered over $25
per backlink on pages with PR8, while buyers offered
nearly $5 per backlink on PR4 pages, the most popularly-
requested PR.
Next, we look more closely at buyers who posted
“grey hat” link building jobs, or ones that allow for such
questionable SEO methods as blog commenting, forum
posting, etc. For these Freelancer job postings, buyers of-
tentimes directly specify the URL that they are interested
in using greyhat techniques on. We extracted over two
thousand URLs that were present in the body of the grey-

hat link building posts. Using Yahoo Site Explorer [13],
we checked the ﬁrst 1,000 inlinks (restricted by the API)
pointing to each URL. Then, we ﬁltered URLs with more
than 1,000 inlinks remaining (i.e., not retrievable via the
Yahoo API), yielding 813 sites. Table 8 shows the top
domain names for the inlinks. As expected, Blogspot and
Wordpress are highly targeted for link spamming. Yahoo
Answers and Groups, as well as Google Knol and Google
Sites, are also targeted.
