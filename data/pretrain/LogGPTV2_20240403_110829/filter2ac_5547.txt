### Title: Botconf 2016 - Unraveling Linux/Moose 2.0: The EGO MARKET

Are you looking to boost your blog's visibility or increase the views on your "gun show"? Consider purchasing 50,000 fake followers for just $1,000! Click farms in the developing world and botnets like Game Over Zeus are more than willing to provide these services.

In this presentation, a criminologist and a security researcher collaborated to investigate a large-scale botnet known to Botconf 2015 attendees: Linux/Moose. The investigation was particularly challenging due to the advanced stealth features of Linux/Moose 2.0, which operates exclusively on embedded systems such as consumer routers and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

To understand how this botnet spreads and is managed, we deployed honeypots globally. By infecting virtual routers, we were able to monitor and analyze the botnet's behavior over several months. We conducted a large-scale HTTPS man-in-the-middle attack on multiple honeypots, decrypting the bot's proxy traffic to gather extensive data on its activities. This included the names of the fake accounts it uses, its methods for generating fake follows, and the identification of its customers, including both companies and individuals.

This research provides valuable insights into the operations of Linux/Moose 2.0 and highlights the importance of securing embedded systems against such threats.
