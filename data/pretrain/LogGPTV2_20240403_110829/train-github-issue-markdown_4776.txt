### Issue Description

The TypeScript type definitions for `SelectField` include a property named `openImmediately`, which is intended to be passed to the `DropDownMenu` child component. However, the actual implementation of `SelectField` does not support this property. Instead of passing it down to `DropDownMenu`, it results in a console warning:

```
warning.js:33 Warning: React does not recognize the `openImmediately` prop on a DOM element. If you intentionally want it to appear in the DOM as a custom attribute, spell it as lowercase `openimmediately` instead. If you accidentally passed it from a parent component, remove it from the DOM element.

```

### Expected Behavior

- A `SelectField` with `openImmediately={true}` should be displayed open without requiring a click.
- There should be no console errors if the `openImmediately` property is used on a `SelectField`.

### Current Behavior

- A `SelectField` with `openImmediately={true}` is not opened automatically.
- A console error is displayed when the `openImmediately` prop is set.

### Steps to Reproduce

To reproduce this issue in your React application, use the following code:

```jsx
// Example code to reproduce the issue
<SelectField openImmediately={true}>
  <MenuItem value="1">Option 1</MenuItem>
  <MenuItem value="2">Option 2</MenuItem>
</SelectField>
```
