The typescript typings support a property "openImmediately" in SelectField
which is supposed to be passed to the DropDownMenu child. But the actual
SelectField implementation doesn't support it, it's not passed down to
DropDownMenu, there's a console error instead:
warning.js:33 Warning: React does not recognize the `openImmediately` prop on
a DOM element. If you intentionally want it to appear in the DOM as a custom
attribute, spell it as lowercase `openimmediately` instead. If you
accidentally passed it from a parent component, remove it from the DOM
element.

## Expected Behavior
A SelectField with openImmediately=true should be displayed open without
click. There should be no error on the console if the property openImmediately
is used on a SelectField.
## Current Behavior
A SelectField with openImmediately=true is not opened automatically. There is
and error on the console if this prop is set.
