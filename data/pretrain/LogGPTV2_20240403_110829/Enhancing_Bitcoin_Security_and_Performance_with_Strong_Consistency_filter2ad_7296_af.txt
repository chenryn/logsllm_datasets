### A More Democratic Mining Power Allocation

A more democratic alternative to the current mining power allocation might involve a "one person, one vote" principle. This could be achieved through the use of anonymous proof-of-personhood tokens, distributed at pseudonymous parties [28]. However, the ideal choice of Sybil attack-resistance mechanisms remains an open issue for future work, distinct from the focus of this paper.

### Other Directions for Future Research

Beyond the issues discussed, there are several other intriguing open questions:

- **Sharding**: Sharding [17] is a promising approach for scaling distributed protocols and has already been studied in the context of private blockchains [18]. A sharded variant of ByzCoin could potentially achieve even better scalability and performance. A key challenge in this context is the generation of bias-resistant public randomness [40], which would enable the secure and distributed selection of shard members.
  
- **Incentive Mechanisms**: Another challenge is to find ways to increase the incentives for rational miners to remain honest. One potential solution is to bind coins and destroy them when misbehavior is detected [10].
  
- **Asynchronous BFT Protocols**: Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) protocols [12, 11] are another interesting class of protocols that have only recently begun to be analyzed in the context of blockchains [46].

### Conclusion

ByzCoin is a scalable Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus algorithm designed for open, decentralized blockchain systems like Bitcoin. Its strong consistency enhances Bitcoin's core security guarantees, protecting against attacks such as N-confirmation double-spending, intentional blockchain forks, and selfish mining. Additionally, ByzCoin enables high scalability and low transaction latency. While its application to Bitcoin is a notable example, ByzCoin can theoretically be deployed in any blockchain-based system. The proof-of-work-based leader election mechanism can also be replaced with alternatives such as proof-of-stake.

If open membership is not a requirement, the consensus group can be static, though it can still be large. We have developed a wide-scale prototype implementation of ByzCoin, validated its efficiency through measurements and experiments, and demonstrated that Bitcoin can increase its transaction capacity by more than two orders of magnitude.
