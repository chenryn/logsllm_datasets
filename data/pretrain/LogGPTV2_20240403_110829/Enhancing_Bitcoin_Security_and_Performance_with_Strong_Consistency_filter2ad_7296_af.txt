A more democratic alternative might be to apportion
mining power on a “1 person, 1 vote” principle, based
on anonymous proof-of-personhood tokens distributed at
pseudonym parties [28]. Regardless, we treat the ideal
choice of Sybil attack-resistance mechanism as an issue
for future work, orthogonal to the focus of this paper.

Other Directions. Besides the issues outlined above,
there are many more interesting open questions worth
considering: Sharding [17] presents a promising ap-
proach to scale distributed protocols and was already
studied for private blockchains [18]. A sharded variant of
ByzCoin might thus achieve even better scalability and
performance numbers. A key obstacle that needs to be
analyzed in that context before though is the generation
of bias-resistant public randomness [40] which would
enable to pick members of a shard in a distributed and se-
cure manner. Yet another challenge is to ﬁnd ways to in-
crease incentives of rational miners to remain honest, like
binding coins and destroying them when misbehavior is
detected [10]. Finally, asynchronous BFT [12, 11] is an-
other interesting class of protocols, which only recently
started to be analyzed in the context of blockchains [46].
8 Conclusion
ByzCoin is a scalable Byzantine fault tolerant consen-
sus algorithm for open decentralized blockchain systems
such as Bitcoin. ByzCoin’s strong consistency increases
Bitcoin’s core security guarantees—shielding against at-
tacks on the consensus and mining system such as
N-conﬁrmation double-spending, intentional blockchain
forks, and selﬁsh mining—and also enables high scal-
ability and low transaction latency. ByzCoin’s applica-
tion to Bitcoin is just one example, though:
theoreti-
cally, it can be deployed to any blockchain-based system,
and the proof-of-work-based leader election mechanism
might be changed to another approach such as proof-
of-stake.
If open membership is not an objective, the
consensus group could be static, though still potentially
large. We developed a wide-scale prototype implemen-
tation of ByzCoin, validated its efﬁciency with measure-
ments and experiments, and have shown that Bitcoin can
increase the capacity of transactions it handles by more
than two orders of magnitude.
