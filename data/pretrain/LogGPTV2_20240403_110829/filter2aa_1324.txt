Overview 
What this Presentation is: 
•  Overview of Smart Meter & Smart Grid technology 
•  Detail network traffic-based approach 
− As opposed to meter firmware modification 
− Concepts/Protocols/Etc.  
•  Caveat: We're just pentesters and network geeks, not RF/
SCADA/Hardware gods

Why? 
•  Utility 
− Reduce staff overhead (for better or worse) 
− Remote Start/Stop Service  
− Demand Forecasting, demand pricing ($$)  
− Remote flash upgrades/diagnostics 
•  Customer  
− Monitor/track consumption  
− Opt-in for "smart appliances" (we'll get to that)  
− (in theory...) equal or reduced costs.

Smart Meter 101 
•  What utility types are using Smart Meters? 
− All of them: Gas, Water, & Electric  
•  Typical Smart Meter Hardware 
− 32-bit ARM Processor (or similar)  
− 256k RAM (yes k)  
− 512k Flash memory  
− Transceiver (we'll get to that)  
− Communication method (usually over TCP/IP) 
Case Studies: Smart Meter Network Types

Example 1: Licensed Spectrum 
•  900MHz licensed band 
− Frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) 
− Hybrid star/mesh network 
•   Advantages 
− Reliability 
− Longevity (as long as the band license is renewed) 
•   Disadvantages 
− Overhead  
− Proprietary System

Example 2: Existing 3rd Party Network 
•  GPRS 
− Primarily GSM-based (AT&T, etc) 
− CDMA is an option (but not widely used) 
− Point to point connectivity 
•   Advantages 
− Uses existing infrastructure 
− Coverage 
− Layered security of GSM (not as of 3hrs ago) and VPN tunnel 
•   Disadvantages 
− Control over reliability of metering network 
− Future-proof?

Example 3: Other Implementations 
•  Powerline 
− Big in EU, Japan, etc 
− Distance Matters! 
•   Broadband 
− Can use existing infrastructure 
− Interoperability is key 
− Leverage existing technologies

My Fridge Told Me I’m Fat:  HANs and “Smart” 
Appliances 
HAN: Home Area Network 
•  Keys to success  
− Low Resource - small footprint  
− Low power (sorry Wifi, Bluetooth)  
− Secure (sorry, X-10)  
− Low Bandwidth 
•  Answer: Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4)  
− Mesh/Star/Cluster topology 
− Security - Pre-shared keys (AES EAX)  
− Effective range: ~100 Ft  
•  Interaction with Appliances 
Security and Policy Implications

Is this Secure?  Well, It Depends… 
•  Who are our attackers?   
•  It only works if you make use of all the features!  
•  Reliance on 3rd party security – GSM 
•  Feature Fluff 
•  Security through obscurity strikes again 
− Use of FHSS/"proprietary" FSK  
− Proprietary Command Sets 
•  Physical security  
− Location of attacker  
− Equipment security 
•  Incident response

Policy and Legal Implications 
•  They told me not to, so I won't. 
− Our network is secure because the FCC says you can't play in our 
sandbox. 
•  "Transmissions cannot be duplicated using off the shelf 
equipment.” 
− Oh Really? 
− Say hello to my USRP 
•  "Critical Infrastructure" – CIPA 
− Does this mean any transmission network is CI too?

More Policy Implications 
•  Let’s make sure it works properly 
first! (I’m looking at you, 
California) 
•  Privacy Issues 
− Electrical Surveillance 
− Appliance Control:  Utilities are 
protecting themselves from me, 
but who’s protecting my HAN 
from them?

Even More Policy Implications 
Who benefits? 
•  Utilities! 
•  ...No, seriously. Utilities! 
− Cost savings (discussed previously)  
− American Reinvestment and Recovery Act  
− Pass rest of costs to consumer, if needed 
•  Consumer Benefit  
− Inelastic demand - not going to alter lifestyle  
− More benefit from power saving appliances 
•  Possible benefits to business  
− Manufacturing - schedule process runs

Where are we Going? 
•  Like it or not, the Smart Grid is coming 
− Replacement of aging infrastructure  
•  We still need a standard...seriously 
− IP? 
− ANSI 12.19/12.22 
− Zigbee?  
•  Everyone Plays a Role: 
− Utilities - deploy securely and responsibly  
− Government - regulate (modestly) 
− Consumer - advocate

To-Do’s 
•  Extend time frame  
•  Construct legitimate test environment 
− Fewer legal implications  
•  True examination of network from a pen test standpoint 
− At the heart, it's IP - remember?
