**Current Behavior**  
When running `webpack -p` on an existing project without any changes other than upgrading the Angular version from `rc.4` to `rc.5` (i.e., without converting the code to use `NgModule`), child components are not rendered.

However, `webpack -p` works correctly with `rc.4`, and it also works with `rc.5` when using `webpack -d`.

**Expected Behavior**  
The minified code generated by `webpack -p` should render all components as it does with `rc.4`.

**Angular Version**  
2.0.0-rc.5

**Browser**  
Latest Chrome

**Language**  
TypeScript 1.8.7 | ES6; generated from Visual Studio 2015
