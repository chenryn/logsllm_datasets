**Current behavior**  
When executing "webpack -p" against existing project w/o any changes other
than upgrading the version number from rc.4 -> rc.5 (aka, not converting code
to use NgModule), child components do not get rendered.
"webpack -p" works when the version is rc.4 and also works with rc.5 with
"webpack -d"
**Expected/desired behavior**  
Expected for the minified code via "webpack -p" would render all components
like it does with rc.4
