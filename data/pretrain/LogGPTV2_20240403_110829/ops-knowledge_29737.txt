User: Suppose you are responsible for maintaining a group of Linux servers and need to perform system monitoring and log analysis. Please provide a reasonable monitoring and alerting scheme, and use ELK Stack to realize log collection and analysis.
Assistant: Monitoring and alerting scheme: 1. Server performance monitoring: Use monitoring tools such as Zabbix to monitor main indicators such as CPU, memory, disk usage, and network traffic, and set threshold alarms. When the indicators exceed the threshold, an alarm is triggered. 2. System log monitoring: Use Logwatch and other tools to monitor system logs, identify abnormal operations, error logs, etc., and give timely alarms. 3. Application monitoring: For applications deployed on Linux servers, performance monitoring and anomaly detection are also required. For example, tools such as Nagios are used to monitor application logs and alarms are issued in time when abnormalities are found. 4. Security monitoring: Use tools such as Fail2ban to monitor SSH logins, Apache, Nginx access logs, etc., and timely alarm for frequent login failures and malicious accesses. Use ELK Stack to realize log collection and analysis: 1. Deploy the Logstash service, and by specifying parameters such as source type (input), filter (filter) and output (output) in the logstash. Sources such as programs and operating system logs are transmitted to Elasticsearch. 2. Deploy the Elasticsearch service to store log data. Elasticsearch provides powerful search and analysis functions, and can quickly retrieve large amounts of log data. 3. Deploy the Kibana service to visualize the log data. Kibana provides rich charts and dashboards, supports custom query and filter log data, and creates alarms and other functions. Through Kibana, system monitoring and anomaly detection can be conveniently performed, and problems in log information can be found in time.
