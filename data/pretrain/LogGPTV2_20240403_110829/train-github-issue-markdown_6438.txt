Hi  
This is a suggestion.  
bootstrap is one of a wonderful project that I've seen but i think if the
customize page has a little features it becomes more wonderful  
I don't know what colors in the fields look like in customize page in
getbootstrap.com and i have to copy paste that HEX code to see what is the
color of them then change it while if you put a little div box beside each
field to shows the color it was very useful  
Or better than this is put a color picker something like this:  
http://twitterbootstrap3navbars.w3masters.nl/
Then we customize the color and see what is output then compile it  
I think this page doesn't use more
Thanks
