have faith  in their legal status?
Ryan decided to depart in a gradual way through 2002/2003 
and pursue  other opportunities, after automating operations 
and creating an ongoing operations plan.  With limited 
potential to bring in "acceptable" customers, and continued 
borderline profitability, HavenCo was at best stagnating.  
Lack of contracts and share issuane also a major concern.
Sealand decided to find a local redhat webhosting admin to try 
to assume  responsibility for operations on a part-time basis

 My plans to establish a 10kg gold backed online electronic 
currency at HavenCo using anonymous digital cash 
technology shortly after DC X were nixed by Sealand; I was 
forced to avoid any connection between the two, and will 
wait to deploy until after other hosting is in place

““The Coup”
The Coup”
In November 2002, Sealand's advisor demanded the ticketing 
system for customer inquiries be removed, and customer 
mail handled by his girlfriend, resident in the UK.  
Particularly, it was demanded that all billing information be 
handled in the UK by this person, rather than on Sealand in 
an automated web-based billing system. (presumably as a 
preliminary to taking control of the company)
Ryan refused, on grounds of security, unless technical systems 
were put in place to protect customer confidentiality, or the 
CEO decided it was worth the risk after being informed.  This 
debate continued for several days though email, and 
apparently there was behind the scenes scheming in the UK.

The Coup” (continued)
After meeting in Philadelphia PA in late November, Ryan was 
surprised to learn that Sealand wanted to take over 
HavenCo.  A mutually beneficial agreement was worked out, 
under which shares would be issued, debt would be repaid 
to all at an equal rate, and the company would continue to  
operate.  Ryan would resell HavenCo services, as well as 
working on independent projects.
After the agreement, Ryan flew back to the UK, recovered 
personal  belongings and handed over administrative access 
to designated people.

Within 5 days of leaving Sealand, Michael and advisors had 
broken the agreement; refusing to allow resale of services, 
attempting to enforce a blanket non-compete (when none 
was signed at any point, as well as being unlawful if so), and 
stealing personal servers on Sealand left as part of the 
arranged deal.
Shares have still not been issued; outstanding unreimbursed 
expenses  are as far as I am aware not being repaid (I've 
not seen any of the USD  220k owed to me)

What Now
What Now
HavenCo continues to limp along, although as far as I am 
aware customers continue to leave, and few if any new ones 
join.  This can be easily determined through IP address 
utilization on the 217.64.32.0/20 subnet, and specifically the 
217.64.32.35/24 and 217.64.32.36/24 subnets)
metacolo, a 9-datacenter distributed replacement for HavenCo 
using  tamper-resistant hardware, low costs, automation, 
and replication, is growing
While I could sue HavenCo and/or directors for breach of 
contract, etc., the cost would likely exceed the return, as 
HavenCo has no assets, and it would presumably lead to a 
negative resolution of the Sealand sovereignty issue

As far as I am aware, all international organizations asked

this will change, and Sealand will some day be on the UN

 Best guess as to HavenCo status
Best guess as to HavenCo status
HavenCo is probably effectively “nationalized”; investors will 
likely never see any return, barring lawsuits
Sealand will continue to take money from HavenCo 
customers and operate on a zero cost basis until major 
problems develop, or all existing customers leave
No substantial growth or change in business model
Sealand will continue to only accomodate customers without 
PR liability, and may turn over information
No change in Sealand legal status anticipated
Precarious situation for customers without other sites

Ship registrations have in the past been done, and then

Substantial fraudulent 
Television broadcasting to SE UK from Sealand attempted and 
then withdrawn, perhaps due to concerns over legal status 
and ITU/UK response
Amateur radio day was scheduled, and then hurridly cancelled, 
again due to fears of UK and ITU
Proposals to expand Sealand physical territory have come and 
gone

Political and contract stability is critical
Technical costs should be spread over as many sites as

Political/Deployment
Political/Deployment
Globalization is making unilateral action by a single state, even 
a fully recognized one, increasingly difficult
Even a small group of people in power will violate agreements if 
they are capable of doing so; for single-round games, only 
force can enforce agreements.
Many international organizations are very sly at rejecting 
claims of  sovereignty, and drag the process out indefinitely
Sovereignty alone has little value without commercial support 
from banks, etc.

Technical
Technical
Once a flawed system is deployed, maintenance costs can 
rapidly balloon to higher than an efficient but complete 
system's total cost.
Customers don't often ask for objective measurements of 
performance, and have misperceptions of what 
measurements are indicative of their  underlying interests.
Customers generally want to be able to get all services from a 
single organization, if possible (hence use of consultants), 
and need clear value propositions

Personal

Maxing out your personal credit cards to pay the salaries of 
random physical security staff at your company, then not 
getting reimbursed by the company, is annoying.  (I still 
have ~USD 40k in debt due to HavenCo, and little hope of 
being repaid USD 220k in expenses from the company)
While working on an offshore datahaven is novel, being the 
only  technical and pro-liberty employee in a larger company 
is a definite downside.  
Promises that shares will be issued in the future, debts will be 
repaid, etc. are meaningless without documentation, and 
often are meaningless with documentation.

Publicity
Publicity
Press often will report on what one another have already 
reported on; a  single inaccurate quote will echo for some 
time through multiple sources.
Very few reporters are technically capable of verifying 
statements, and lying outright, or at least bending the truth, 
for commercial advantage is  very tempting, but ultimately 
often bad.  ("downstairs are more servers", is technically 
true, but it's a few 386es powered off, is borderline)

I'm developing the most profitable parts  of this first, and using 
it to self-finance the rest of the operation.
I'm convinced we're seeing the accelerated of a lot of anti-
liberty trends, and while education, publicity, legal 
challenges, etc. are essential, ultimately what will win or 
lose is deployed technical systems.
I'm currently traveling around the world, but will probably try 
to establish some kind of high-tech free trade zone in a 
friendly country in the near future, incorporating datacenter, 
office, conference, and housing space, fed with copious 
bandwidth, and with explicit legal  protections for autonomy 
and status, backed by something real.
