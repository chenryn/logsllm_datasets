### Faith in Legal Status?
Ryan decided to gradually depart from HavenCo between 2002 and 2003, pursuing other opportunities after automating operations and creating a sustainable operations plan. With limited potential to attract "acceptable" customers and continued marginal profitability, HavenCo was stagnating. The lack of formal contracts and share issuance was also a significant concern.

### Transition and Operational Challenges
Sealand sought a local Red Hat web hosting administrator to assume part-time responsibility for operations. 

### Defcon 11
**Location:** Las Vegas, NV, USA  
**File:** dc11-havenco.sxi  
**Date:** 24/01/03  
**Page:** 1  
**PI:EMAIL**

### Selling Out/Ultimatum (Continued)
My plans to establish a 10kg gold-backed online electronic currency at HavenCo using anonymous digital cash technology, shortly after Defcon X, were vetoed by Sealand. I was forced to avoid any connection between the two, and will wait to deploy until other hosting is in place.

### The Coup
In November 2002, Sealand's advisor demanded the removal of the ticketing system for customer inquiries, insisting that all customer mail be handled by his girlfriend, who resided in the UK. Specifically, it was demanded that all billing information be managed in the UK by this person, rather than through an automated web-based billing system on Sealand. This was presumably a preliminary step to taking control of the company.

Ryan refused, citing security concerns, unless technical systems were implemented to protect customer confidentiality or the CEO decided it was worth the risk after being informed. This debate continued for several days via email, with apparent behind-the-scenes scheming in the UK.

### The Coup (Continued)
After meeting in Philadelphia, PA, in late November, Ryan was surprised to learn that Sealand wanted to take over HavenCo. A mutually beneficial agreement was reached, under which shares would be issued, debt would be repaid equally, and the company would continue to operate. Ryan would resell HavenCo services and work on independent projects.

Following the agreement, Ryan returned to the UK, recovered personal belongings, and handed over administrative access to designated individuals.

### The Coup (Continued...)
Within five days of leaving Sealand, Michael and his advisors broke the agreement. They refused to allow the resale of services, attempted to enforce a blanket non-compete (despite no such agreement being signed and it being unlawful), and stole personal servers left as part of the deal. Shares have not been issued, and outstanding unreimbursed expenses, including the USD 220k owed to me, remain unpaid.

### Current Status
HavenCo continues to struggle, with customers leaving and few new ones joining. This can be verified through IP address utilization on the 217.64.32.0/20 subnet, specifically the 217.64.32.35/24 and 217.64.32.36/24 subnets. Metacolo, a distributed replacement for HavenCo using tamper-resistant hardware, low costs, automation, and replication, is growing.

While I could sue HavenCo and/or its directors for breach of contract, the cost would likely exceed the return, as HavenCo has no assets. Such legal action might also negatively impact the Sealand sovereignty issue.

### International Recognition
As far as I am aware, all international organizations continue to reject Sealand's claims of sovereignty. It is unlikely that Sealand will be recognized by the UN, but this remains a possibility.

### Is HavenCo Still Alive? (Pro)
- Website (in the US) is still online.
- Network is mostly reachable.
- Continues to respond to emails from prospective clients.
- Sealand is physically present with 1-2 people on-site.

### Is HavenCo Still Alive? (Con)
- No new customers, and old customers are leaving.
- No shares issued or shareholder meetings.
- Large outstanding liabilities.
- Contracts and AUPs violated.
- Company registration lapsed.
- A 2Mbps DDoS attack on 217.64.32.0/20 could shut down the entire company.

### Best Guess on HavenCo's Status
HavenCo is effectively "nationalized"; investors are unlikely to see any return without lawsuits. Sealand will continue to take money from HavenCo customers and operate at zero cost until major problems arise or all existing customers leave. There will be no substantial growth or change in the business model. Sealand will only accommodate customers without PR liability and may turn over information. No change in Sealand's legal status is anticipated, leaving customers in a precarious situation.

### Previous Sealand Ventures
- Ship registrations were done and then retracted, leading to the seizure of a ship by US authorities.
- Substantial fraudulent activities.
- Television broadcasting to SE UK from Sealand was attempted and then withdrawn, possibly due to legal and ITU/UK response concerns.
- An amateur radio day was scheduled and then hastily canceled, again due to fears of UK and ITU responses.
- Proposals to expand Sealand's physical territory have come and gone.
- Even coin and stamp issues have not proceeded.

### Lessons Learned
- Political and contract stability is critical.
- Technical costs should be spread across multiple sites.
- Replication is key.
- Customers prefer a single point of contact for advanced services.

### Political and Deployment Insights
- Globalization makes unilateral action by a single state increasingly difficult.
- Even a small group in power will violate agreements if capable; force is often needed to enforce agreements in single-round games.
- Many international organizations are adept at rejecting sovereignty claims and dragging out the process indefinitely.
- Sovereignty alone has little value without commercial support from banks, etc.

### Technical Insights
- Once a flawed system is deployed, maintenance costs can rapidly exceed those of an efficient system.
- Customers often do not ask for objective performance measurements and may have misconceptions about what metrics are important.
- Customers generally want to get all services from a single organization and need clear value propositions.

### Personal Insights
- Using personal credit cards to pay for company salaries and not being reimbursed is frustrating. I still have approximately USD 40k in debt due to HavenCo, with little hope of being repaid USD 220k in expenses.
- Working on an offshore datahaven is novel, but being the only technical and pro-liberty employee in a larger company is a downside.
- Promises of future share issuance and debt repayment are meaningless without documentation and often meaningless even with documentation.

### Publicity
- The press often reports on what others have already reported, and a single inaccurate quote can echo through multiple sources.
- Few reporters are technically capable of verifying statements, and lying or bending the truth for commercial advantage is tempting but ultimately harmful.

### Future Plans
I still believe in secure client systems, secure servers in secure locations (both legally and technically), and secure protocols over available but insecure networks. I plan to deploy or work with those who deploy each.

### Deployment Goals for the Future
- Secure clients using free operating systems and tamper-resistant PDAs and other devices.
- Servers using hardware tamper-resistant modules, replication/distribution, and cryptography.
- Server colocation in secure spaces within other carrier facilities in legally advantageous locations worldwide, allowing users to tailor the regulatory environment to their application.
- Secure protocols and applications using cryptography.

### Deployment Goals (Continued)
- Reliable and available communications using IP networks, possibly LEO satellite constellations, RF, and fiber.
- Support services to allow true location-independence and location-selection by all users, including anonymous electronic cash.
- Specialized hardware devices for certain physical industries, integrating cryptography into real-world objects.

### Next Steps
I am developing the most profitable parts first to self-finance the rest of the operation. I am convinced that anti-liberty trends are accelerating, and while education, publicity, and legal challenges are essential, deployed technical systems will ultimately determine the outcome. I am currently traveling around the world and plan to establish a high-tech free trade zone in a friendly country, incorporating datacenter, office, conference, and housing space, with copious bandwidth and explicit legal protections for autonomy and status, backed by something real.

### Projects I Am Involved With
