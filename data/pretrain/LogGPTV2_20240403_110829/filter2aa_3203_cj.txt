### 3. Multicast-Enabled Routers and Packet Resending

Multicast-enabled routers forward multicast data packets throughout the IPv4 network to subnets containing group members. When a receiver detects a missing packet, it sends a PGM (Pragmatic General Multicast) message to its nearest PGM router, requesting the retransmission of the missing packet with a specific sequence number. This request is then forwarded to either the original source or a PGM router that stores recent packets sent by the source. In either case, the missing packet is directly sent to the requesting receiver.

#### Abstract
This appendix provides an overview of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and its support in Microsoft Windows operating systems. SNMP is widely used in enterprise network environments to manage various types of network devices. Network administrators must understand SNMP to integrate computers running Windows Vista, Windows XP, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2003 into an SNMP-managed environment.

#### SNMP Overview
SNMP is a network management protocol and infrastructure commonly used on IP networks. It was initially developed in the Internet community to monitor and troubleshoot routers and bridges. SNMP allows network administrators to manage network devices such as workstation or server computers, routers, switches, and wireless access points.

**Key Functions of SNMP:**
- **Remote Configuration:** You can use SNMP to configure devices across the network from a central management computer.
- **Network Performance Monitoring:** SNMP enables systematic and periodic querying of devices for current performance statistics to monitor network throughput.
- **Fault Detection and Security Alerts:** Devices can use SNMP to send messages when specific events occur, such as device restarts, link failures, unauthorized access, and low disk space on file servers.

**SNMP Architecture:**
- **SNMP Management Systems (Management Stations/Consoles):** These are computers running SNMP management software that send information and update requests to devices running an SNMP agent. The management system can request information (e.g., available hard disk space, active sessions) and, if granted write access, can also change a device's configuration.
- **SNMP Agents:** These are devices running software that collects information and responds to management system requests. Agents can be configured to track specific statistics and authorize certain management systems to request information. Typically, agents do not initiate messages but respond to them. However, they can be configured to report specific events, such as system restarts or unauthorized access.

**Figure B-1** shows an example of SNMP being used on a network.

#### Management Information Base (MIB)
The MIB contains manageable objects representing various types of information about a network device, such as the number of active sessions or the version of the network operating system. SNMP management systems and agents share a common understanding of MIB objects. The agent maintains information about the objects in the MIB, and the management system retrieves this information from the agent.

**Hierarchical Name Tree:**
The MIB object name space is hierarchical, allowing each manageable object to have a globally unique name. When a management system requests a data object from an agent, it includes the globally unique name in the request. Authority for parts of the name space is assigned to individual organizations, enabling them to assign names to new objects without consulting an Internet authority. For example, the name space assigned to the LAN Manager MIB II is 1.3.6.1.4.1.77, and Microsoft has been assigned 1.3.6.1.4.1.311 for all new MIBs.

**Figure B-2** shows a portion of the SNMP hierarchical name tree.

#### SNMP Messages
SNMP uses the following message types:
- **Get-request:** Sent by an SNMP management system to request information about a single MIB object on an SNMP agent.
- **Get-next-request:** An extended type of request message used to browse an entire tree of management objects.
- **Getbulk-request:** Sent by an SNMP management system to request the maximum amount of data within the constraints of the maximum message size.
- **Set-request:** Sent by an SNMP management system to assign an updated value for a MIB object (if write access is enabled).
- **Get-response:** Sent by the SNMP agent in response to a Get-request, Get-next-request, Getbulk-request, or Set-request message.
- **Trap:** An unsolicited message sent by an SNMP agent to an SNMP management system when a specific event occurs.

These messages are typically sent as unicast UDP messages. For example, Get-request, Get-next-request, Getbulk-request, and Set-request messages are sent to the agent's IPv4 address and destination UDP port 161. Trap messages are sent to the management system's IPv4 address and destination UDP port 162.

**Figure B-3** shows the exchange of messages between an SNMP management system and an SNMP agent.

#### SNMP Communities
SNMP communities are collections of hosts grouped together for administrative purposes. Community names provide context checking for agents and management systems. An agent will not accept a request from a management system outside its configured communities, and a management system will not accept a trap from an agent outside its configured communities.

Community names are primarily used for organization rather than security. SNMP messages are often sent without IPsec protection, making them vulnerable to interception. Capturing unprotected SNMP messages can allow a malicious user to determine the community name and send their own SNMP messages.

There is no relationship between community names and domain or workgroup names. Agents and management systems can be members of multiple communities simultaneously, providing flexibility in configuring the SNMP infrastructure.

**Figure B-4** shows an example of two defined communities—IT and Admin.

#### How SNMP Works
The following steps describe a typical get operation in SNMP:
1. **Request Sent:** An SNMP management system sends a Get-request, Get-next-request, or Getbulk-request message to an SNMP agent, including one or more data objects and a community name. The message is sent to the agent's IPv4 address and destination UDP port 161.
2. **Request Received and Verified:** The agent verifies the community name. If valid, the request is passed to the appropriate MIB component, which returns the requested information to the agent.
3. **Response Sent:** The SNMP agent sends a Get-response message to the SNMP management system with the requested information.

**Figure B-5** shows this process.

#### Windows SNMP Service
The SNMP service in Windows is SNMP agent software that provides information to management systems running SNMP management software. The SNMP service:
- Responds to requests for status information from multiple hosts.
- Reports significant events (traps) to multiple hosts as they occur.
- Uses host names and IPv4 addresses to identify the hosts to which it reports information and from which it receives requests.

The Windows SNMP service is a Windows Sockets application, providing an internal infrastructure for third-party developers to create their own MIBs and develop SNMP management system applications.

**Supported MIBs:**
- **Internet MIB II:** A superset of Internet MIB I, defining objects essential for fault or configuration analysis.
- **LAN Manager MIB II:** Defines objects for share, session, user, and logon information.
- **DHCP MIB:** Monitors DHCP server activity, automatically installed with the DHCP server service.
- **WINS MIB:** Monitors WINS server activity, automatically installed with the WINS Server service.
- **IIS MIBs:** Monitor FTP and HTTP activity, automatically installed with IIS.
- **RADIUS Server MIBs:** Monitor RADIUS server authentication and accounting activity, automatically installed with the Internet Authentication Service (IAS).
