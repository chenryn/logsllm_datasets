Hello,
Major Minor Build Revision
* * *
10 0 18362 752
PowerToys version: 0.18.2
Fancyzones
Did the download/install.
I click on fancyzones
Select a layout and I can see the ghosting of the areas on the screen
save it and exit powertoys
Fancyzones does not work I cannot locate any of the zones. There is nothing
highlighting on the screen or indicating they are there.
I uninstalled several times and went back to version 0.16.x but still does not
work.
checked that .NET was installed properly.
Uninstalled and quit any application that I thought would interfere. As an
example I removed displaylink.
In the Event Log I constantly see " APPCRASH Not Available 0
FancyZonesEditor.exe 0.18.2.0..."
Have an AOC CU34G2X monitor.
Dan.
