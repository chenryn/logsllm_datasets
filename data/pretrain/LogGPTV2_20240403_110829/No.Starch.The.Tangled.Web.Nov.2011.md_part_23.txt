### Older Versions of Internet Explorer

In fact, some of these behaviors are still present in older versions of Internet Explorer. These behaviors are unlikely to impact mainstream web applications, as such applications are not typically accessed through IP-based URLs and often simply fail to function properly. However, a few systems, primarily used by technical staff, are designed to be accessed via their IP addresses. These systems may not have DNS records configured at all. In such cases, the ability for `http://1.2.3.4/` to inject cookies for `http://123.234.3.4/` can be problematic. Additionally, the IP-reachable administrative interfaces of home routers are also of concern.

### Hostnames with Extra Periods

At their core, cookie-setting algorithms depend on counting the number of periods in a URL to determine whether a particular domain parameter is acceptable. This count is typically correlated with a list of several hundred entries on the vendor-maintained Public Suffix List (http://publicsuffix.org/).

Unfortunately, it is often possible to add extra periods to a hostname and still have it resolve correctly. Non-canonical hostname representations with excess periods are usually honored by OS-level resolvers and, if honored, will confuse the browser. Although a browser would not automatically consider a domain like `www.example.com.pl.` (with an extra trailing period) to be the same as `www.example.com.pl`, the subtle and seemingly harmless difference in the URL could escape even the most attentive users.

In such cases, interacting with the URL with a trailing period can be unsafe, as other documents sharing the `*.com.pl.` domain may be able to inject cross-domain cookies with relative ease. This period-counting problem was first noticed around 1998. About a decade later, many browser vendors decided to roll out basic mitigations by adding another special case to the relevant code. As of this writing, Opera is still susceptible to this trick.

### Non-Fully Qualified Hostnames

Many users browse the web with their DNS resolvers configured to append local suffixes to all found hostnames, often without their knowledge. Such settings are usually sanctioned by ISPs or employers through automatic network configuration data (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, DHCP).

For any user browsing with such a setting, the resolution of DNS labels is ambiguous. For example, if the DNS search path includes `coredump.cx`, then `www.example.com` may resolve to the real `www.example.com` website or to `www.example.com.coredump.cx` if such a record exists. The outcomes are partly controlled by configuration settings and, to some extent, can be influenced by an attacker.

To the browser, both locations appear to be the same, which may have some interesting side effects. Consider one particularly perverse case: Should `http://com`, which actually resolves to `http://com.coredump.cx/`, be able to set `*.com` cookies by simply omitting the domain parameter?

### Local Files

Because local resources loaded through the `file:` protocol do not have an explicit hostname associated with them, it’s impossible for the browser to compute a normal origin. For a long time, vendors simply decided that the best course of action in such a case would be to ditch the same-origin policy. Thus, any HTML document saved to disk would automatically be granted access to any other local files via `XMLHttpRequest` or DOM, and even more inexplicably, would be able to access any internet-originating content in the same way.

This proved to be a poor design decision. No one expected that the mere act of downloading an HTML document would put all of the user’s local files and online credentials in jeopardy. After all, accessing that same document over the web would be perfectly safe.

Many browsers have tried to close this loophole in recent years, with varying degrees of success:

- **Chrome (and, by extension, other WebKit browsers)**: Chrome completely disallows any cross-document DOM or `XMLHttpRequest` access from `file:` origins and ignores `document.cookie` calls or directives in this setting. Access to a `localStorage` container shared by all `file:` documents is permitted, but this may change soon.
  
- **Firefox**: Mozilla’s browser permits access only to files within the directory of the original document, as well as nearby subdirectories. This policy is pretty good but still poses some risk to documents stored or previously downloaded to that location. Access to cookies via `document.cookie` or directives is possible, and all `file:` cookies are visible to any other local JavaScript code. The same holds true for access to storage mechanisms.
  
- **Internet Explorer 7 and above**: Unconstrained access to local and internet content from `file:` origins is permitted, but it requires the user to click through a non-specific warning to execute JavaScript first. The consequences of this action are not clearly explained, and many users may be tricked into clicking through the prompt. Internet Explorer’s cookie semantics are similar to those of Firefox, but web storage is not supported in this origin.
  
- **Opera and Internet Explorer 6**: Both of these browsers permit unconstrained DOM or `XMLHttpRequest` access without further checks. Non-compartmentalized `file:` cookies are also permitted.

**Note**: Plug-ins live by their own rules in `file:` land. Flash uses a local-with-filesystem sandbox model, which gives largely unconstrained access to the local filesystem, regardless of the policy enforced by the browser itself. Executing Java or Windows Presentation Framework applets from the local filesystem may, in some cases, be roughly equivalent to running an untrusted binary.

### Pseudo-URLs

The behavior of pseudo-URLs such as `about:`, `data:`, or `javascript:` originally constituted a significant loophole in the implementations of the same-origin policy. All such URLs would be considered same-origin and would permit unconstrained cross-domain access from any other resource loaded over the same scheme. The current behavior, which is very different, will be the topic of the next chapter of this book. In a nutshell, the status quo reflects several rounds of hastily implemented improvements and is a complex mix of browser-specific special cases and origin-inheritance rules.

### Browser Extensions and UI

Several browsers permit JavaScript-based UI elements or certain user-installed browser extensions to run with elevated privileges. These privileges may entail circumventing specific SOP checks or calling normally unavailable APIs to write files, modify configuration settings, and so on.

Privileged JavaScript is a prominent feature of Firefox, where it is used with XUL to build large portions of the browser user interface. Chrome also relies on privileged JavaScript to a smaller but still notable degree.

The same-origin policy does not support privileged contexts in any specific way. The actual mechanism by which extra privileges are granted may involve loading the document over a special and normally unreachable URL scheme, such as `chrome:` or `res:`, and then adding special cases for that scheme in other portions of the browser code. Another option is simply to toggle a binary flag for a JavaScript context, regardless of its actual origin, and examine that flag later. In all cases, the behavior of standard APIs such as `localStorage`, `document.domain`, or `document.cookie` may be difficult to predict and should not be relied upon. Some browsers attempt to maintain isolation between the contexts belonging to different extensions, but most don’t.

**Note**: Whenever writing browser extensions, any interaction with non-privileged contexts must be performed with extreme caution. Examining untrusted contexts can be difficult, and the use of mechanisms such as `eval(...)` or `innerHTML` may open up privilege-escalation paths.

### Other Uses of Origins

The concept of origins and host- or domain-based security mechanisms is not limited to content isolation and makes many other appearances in the browser world. Other quasi-origin-based privacy or security features include preferences and cached information related to per-site cookie handling, pop-up blocking, geolocation sharing, password management, camera and microphone access (in Flash), and much more. These features tend to interact with the security features described in this chapter to some extent, and we will explore this topic in more detail soon.

### Security Engineering Cheat Sheet

#### Good Security Policy Hygiene for All Websites
- To protect your users, include a top-level `crossdomain.xml` file with the `permitted-cross-domain-policies` parameter set to `master-only` or `by-content-type`, even if you do not use Flash anywhere on your site. Doing so will prevent unrelated attacker-controlled content from being misinterpreted as a secondary `crossdomain.xml` file, effectively undermining the assurances of the same-origin policy in Flash-enabled browsers.

#### When Relying on HTTP Cookies for Authentication
- Use the `httponly` flag; design the application so that there is no need for JavaScript to access authentication cookies directly. Sensitive cookies should be scoped as tightly as possible, preferably by not specifying the domain at all.
- If the application is meant to be HTTPS only, cookies must be marked as secure, and you must be prepared to handle cookie injection gracefully. (HTTP contexts may overwrite secure cookies, even though they can’t read them.) Cryptographic cookie signing may help protect against unconstrained modification, but it does not defend against replacing a victim’s cookies with another set of legitimately obtained credentials.

#### When Arranging Cross-Domain Communications in JavaScript
- Do not use `document.domain`. Rely on `postMessage(...)` where possible and be sure to specify the destination origin correctly; then verify the sender’s origin when receiving the data on the other end. Beware of naïve substring matches for domain names: `msg.origin.indexOf(".example.com")` is very insecure.
- Note that various pre-`postMessage` SOP bypass tricks, such as relying on `window.name`, are not tamper-proof and should not be used for exchanging sensitive data.

#### When Embedding Plug-in-Handled Active Content from Third Parties
- **Flash**: Do not specify `allowScriptAccess=always` unless you fully trust the owner of the originating domain and the security of its site. Do not use this setting when embedding HTTP applets on HTTPS pages. Also, consider restricting `allowFullScreen` and `allowNetworking` as appropriate.
- **Silverlight**: Do not specify `enableHtmlAccess=true` unless you trust the originating domain, as above.
- **Java**: Java applets can’t be safely embedded from untrusted sources. Omitting `mayscript` does not fully prevent access to the embedding page, so do not attempt to do so.

#### When Hosting Your Own Plug-in-Executed Content
- Note that many cross-domain communication mechanisms provided by browser plug-ins may have unintended consequences. In particular, avoid `crossdomain.xml`, `clientaccesspolicy.xml`, or `allowDomain(...)` rules that point to domains you do not fully trust.

#### When Writing Browser Extensions
- Avoid relying on `innerHTML`, `document.write(...)`, `eval(...)`, and other error-prone coding patterns, which can cause code injection on third-party pages or in a privileged JavaScript context.
- Do not make security-critical decisions by inspecting untrusted JavaScript security contexts, as their behavior can be deceptive.

### Origin Inheritance

Some web applications rely on pseudo-URLs such as `about:`, `javascript:`, or `data:` to create HTML documents that do not contain any server-supplied content and are instead populated with data constructed entirely on the client side. This approach eliminates the delay associated with the usual HTTP requests to the server and results in far more responsive user interfaces.

Unfortunately, the original vision of the same-origin policy did not account for such a use case. Specifically, a literal application of the protocol-, host-, and port-matching rules discussed in Chapter 9 would cause every `about:blank` document created on the client side to have a different origin from its parent page, preventing it from being meaningfully manipulated. Further, all `about:blank` windows created by completely unrelated websites would belong to the same origin and, under the right circumstances, would be able to interfere with each other with no supervision at all.

To address this incompatibility of client-side documents with the same-origin policy, browsers gradually developed incompatible and sometimes counterintuitive approaches to computing a synthetic origin and access permissions for pseudo-URLs. An understanding of these rules is important on its own merit and will lay the groundwork for the discussion of certain other SOP exceptions in Chapter 11.

#### Origin Inheritance for `about:blank`

The `about:` scheme is used in modern browsers for a variety of purposes, most of which are not directly visible to normal web pages. The `about:blank` document is an interesting special case: This URL can be used to create a minimal DOM hierarchy (essentially a valid but empty document) to which the parent document may write arbitrary data later on.

Here is an example of a typical use of this scheme:
```html
<iframe id="test" src="about:blank"></iframe>
<script>
  frames["test"].document.body.innerHTML = "Hi mom!";
</script>
```
**Note**: In the HTML markup provided in this example, and when creating new windows or frames in general, `about:blank` can be omitted. The value is defaulted to when no other URL is specified by the creator of the parent document.

In every browser, most types of navigation to `about:blank` result in the creation of a new document that inherits its SOP origin from the page that initiated the navigation. The inherited origin is reflected in the `document.domain` property of the new JavaScript execution context, and DOM access to or from any other origins is not permitted.

This simple formula holds true for navigation actions such as clicking a link, submitting a form, creating a new frame or a window from a script, or programmatically navigating an existing document. That said, there are exceptions, the most notable of which are several special, user-controlled navigation methods. These include manually entering `about:blank` in the address bar, following a bookmark, or performing a gesture reserved for opening a link in a new window or tab. These actions will result in a document that occupies a unique synthetic origin and cannot be accessed by any other page.

Another special case is the loading of a normal server-supplied document that subsequently redirects to `about:blank` using `Location` or `Refresh`. In Firefox and WebKit-based browsers, such redirection results in a unique, non-accessible origin, similar to the scenario outlined in the previous paragraph. In Internet Explorer, on the other hand, the resulting document will be accessible by the parent page if the redirection occurs inside an `<iframe>` but not if it took place in a separate window. Opera’s behavior is the most difficult to understand: `Refresh` results in a document that can be accessed by the parent page, but the `Location` redirect will give the resulting page the origin of the site that performed the redirect.

Further, it is possible for a parent document to navigate an existing document frame to an `about:blank` URL, even if the existing document shown in that container has a different origin than the caller. The newly created blank document will inherit the origin from the caller in all browsers other than Internet Explorer. In the case of Internet Explorer, such navigation will succeed but will result in an inaccessible document. (This behavior is most likely not intentional.)

If this description makes your head spin, the handling of `about:blank` documents is summarized in Table 10-1.

| Type of Navigation | New Page | Existing Non-Same-Origin Frame | Location Redirect | Refresh Redirect | URL Entry or Gesture |
|--------------------|----------|--------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Internet Explorer** | Inherited from caller | Unique origin | Denied | Frame: Inherited from caller, Window: Unique origin | Unique origin |
| **Firefox** | Inherited from caller | Unique origin | Unique origin | Unique origin | Unique origin |
| **WebKit** | Inherited from caller | Unique origin | Denied | Unique origin | Unique origin |
| **Opera** | Inherited from caller | Inherited from parent | Inherited from redirecting party | Inherited from parent | Inherited from parent |

#### Inheritance for `data:` URLs

The `data:` scheme, first outlined in Chapter 2, was designed to permit small documents, such as icons, to be conveniently encoded and then directly inlined in an HTML document, saving time on HTTP round-trips. For example:
```html
<img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAUA..." alt="Icon">
```

When the `data:` scheme is used in conjunction with type-specific sub-resources, the only unusual security consideration is that it poses a challenge for plug-ins that wish to derive permissions for an applet from its originating URL. The origin can’t be computed by looking at the URL alone, and the behavior is somewhat unpredictable and highly plug-in specific (for example, Adobe Flash currently rejects any attempts to use `data:` documents).

More important than the case of type-specific content is the use of `data:` as a destination for windows and frames. In all browsers but Internet Explorer, the scheme can be used as an improved variant of `about:blank`, as in this example:
```html
<iframe id="test" src="data:text/html,Hello, world!"></iframe>
```

This approach provides a more flexible and predictable way to create and manipulate client-side documents.
