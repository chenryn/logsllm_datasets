### Analysis of Operator-Specific Protection Mechanisms and Spam Attacks

#### TCP-Based Stealth Spam Attacks

Our analysis reveals that different operators implement specific protection mechanisms to manage data traffic. For instance, Operator-II limits the connection speed to 1 Mbps, implying a protective measure such as blocking TCP connections if they exceed a certain speed. However, these policies vary by operator. Operator-I may block access to any data service, while Operator-II restricts only a specific service.

We also observed that the charging time window is independent of the TCP connection status. When the User Equipment (UE) closes a TCP connection, it sends TCP-RESET signals upon receiving spam packets. Figure 11 illustrates a Wireshark trace at the victim's end, showing TCP-RESET signals indicating the UE has aborted the connection, and the 1056-byte packets are identified as spam. The trace confirms that operators still deliver these spam packets and charge mobile users even after the UE has closed the TCP connection.

To further test this, we conducted experiments with a low source rate of 150 Kbps over various durations. Figure 13 plots the data volume increase for both operators. The results show that a low-rate attack can bypass the security checks implemented by both operators. The attack can persist for up to two hours without any signs of termination, resulting in data volumes exceeding 100 MB.

#### Data Volume Analysis

Figures 12 and 14 present the data volume caused by TCP-based and UDP-based (Skype) stealth spam attacks under various source rates. The figures illustrate the sent, received, and charged data volumes for both Operator-I and Operator-II.

#### UDP-Based Services and Stealth Spam

In the context of UDP-based services, the lack of a connection-oriented protocol makes it more challenging to determine when the service ends and when the charging operation should stop. Unlike TCP, there is no clear protection mechanism for UDP-based services, although operators do implement some abnormality checks for TCP sessions.

A malicious attacker can exploit UDP-based services by tricking the victim into opening a UDP connection. This can be achieved using popular applications like VoIP (e.g., Skype) and video streaming.

##### Example: Spam Attack Using Skype

We demonstrate an attack using Skype, a globally popular VoIP service. The first step involves obtaining the victim’s confidential access information (translated IP address and port number) and permission for the flow to traverse cellular networks. The attacker initiates a call to the victim but hangs up before the call is accepted, ensuring the victim remains unaware. During this process, the victim’s Skype client sends its access information to the attacker, which is confirmed in the Wireshark trace. The operator then grants the traffic flow from the spammer to traverse the cellular network.

In the spam phase, the attacker sends junk UDP packets. The attacker can verify the victim's mobile user status based on the translated IP address provided by NAT. The operator-owned IP address block is known in advance, allowing the spammer to target specific victims and launch operator-specific attacks.

We conducted experiments to validate this attack and check for additional protective measures. The results indicate that the attack can persist and cause significant data usage, highlighting the need for enhanced security mechanisms in UDP-based services.

By varying the attack duration, we observed consistent patterns of data volume increases, confirming the vulnerability of current systems to such attacks.
