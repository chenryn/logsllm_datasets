Hi,  
I looked into the following sentence in **will-navigate** event
(https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/api/web-view-tag.md)
documentation.
> Calling event.preventDefault() does NOT have any effect.
So how can we prevent webview from navigating to other page? I intent to
launch default browser when user clicks on a URL link on webview.  
Here is my code on the renderer process.
     webview.addEventListener('will-navigate', function(e) {
            e.preventDefault();
            require('electron').shell.openExternal(e.url);
     });
With this code, when I click the URL link on webview, webview will navigate to
the new page and default browser also opened showing the new page. I want
webview to stop navigating to the new page.
