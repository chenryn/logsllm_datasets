# Description of the new feature/enhancement
Arguments to the program. for example the ability to specify which mingw one
would want to load, mingw64, mingw32, or msys2. like we can in VSCode
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
This is accomplished in VSCode via this directive in `settings.json`
        "terminal.integrated.env.windows":
        {
            "MSYSTEM": "MINGW64",
            "CHERE_INVOKING":"1"
        },
My thougt process allowed something like
    "commandlineEnv" : 
    {
        "MSYSTEM" : "MINGW64"
    },
In the settins.json file example. just like VSCode
Please do note, i know little to nothing about this language that this program
is written in, so i don't know how difficult it would be to implement.
