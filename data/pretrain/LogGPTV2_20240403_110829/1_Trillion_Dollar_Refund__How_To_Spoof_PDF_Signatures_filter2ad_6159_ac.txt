### Viewer Application Verification and Hashed Part Concatenation

Viewer applications verify if the first entry of the `/ByteRange` is zero. This verification makes it impossible to move the first hashed part to an arbitrary position, as `a > 0` would trigger a warning. To circumvent this, we concatenated both hashed parts into a single unit, allowing `a` to remain zero. Surprisingly, no viewer application verified whether `b > 0`, which means that even in such cases, the Signed Wrapping Attack (SWA) can still be applied. A slightly different variant, Variant 2*, can be created by leveraging the fact that every PDF file starts with `%PDF-` followed by the specified interpreter version (e.g., 1.7). Therefore, a byte range from `a=0` to `b=5` can always be used. A comparison of all SWA variants is depicted in Figure 10.

### Evaluation

#### 5.1 Desktop Applications

In the first phase of our evaluation, we identified desktop applications that validate digitally signed PDF files. We analyzed the security of their signature validation processes against our three attack classes: Universal Signature Forgery (USF), Incremental Saving Attack (ISA), and Signed Wrapping Attack (SWA). The 22 applications listed in Table 1 met our criteria. We evaluated the latest versions of these applications on all supported platforms (Windows, macOS, and Linux).

**Results:**
- During our evaluation, we identified vulnerabilities in 21 out of the 22 applications.
- These vulnerabilities allow for bypassing the document integrity protection provided by the signature and manipulating the displayed content of signed PDF files.
- Only one application, the last Linux version of Adobe Reader (9.5.5) released in 2013, was not successfully attacked.
- The SWA class was the most successful, leading to successful attacks on 17 applications.
- ISA was successful against 11 applications.
- USF succeeded against four applications.

**Detailed Results:**

- **Universal Signature Forgery (USF):** 
  - Successful against four applications, including Adobe Acrobat Reader DC and Adobe Reader XI.
  - Removing or replacing the `/ByteRange` entry with null allowed attackers to change the displayed content while the applications still showed a blue banner stating that the document is "Signed and all signatures are valid."
  - Both applications also informed the user that the document had not been modified since the signature was applied, despite the manipulated content being displayed.

- **Incremental Saving Attack (ISA):**
  - Successful against 11 applications.
  - For example, PDF Studio Viewer 2018 and Perfect PDF 10 Premium display a message that the document has been changed after the signature was applied when a regular incremental save is used.
  - Deleting the Xref table and trailer of the incremental save and adding the keyword `startxref` as a comment at the end of the file created a successful attack for these applications.
  - LibreOffice had two easier bypasses based on ISA Variant 1, involving body updates, a new Xref table, and a new trailer. One bypass used an empty Xref table, while the other included entries for all objects added during the signature process.

- **Signed Wrapping Attack (SWA):**
  - Most successful, affecting 17 applications.
  - A single manipulated document could attack 14 applications by adding new objects, a new Xref table, and a new trailer between the two signed byte ranges.
  - Essential for the attack: (1) The Xref table must contain entries for all added objects and objects in the second signed byte range. (2) The last trailer and the newly added one must reference the correct byte offset of the new Xref table.
  - An interesting but unsuccessful approach involved moving the signed data to the end of the file. Some applications (e.g., eXpert PDF 12 Ultimate, PDF Architect 6, Soda PDF Desktop, and Soda PDF) displayed a message about modifications in the document, but the "View Signed Version" option showed the original content, implying that the document had not been modified.

#### 5.2 Online Validation Services

In the second phase, we focused on online validation services used to verify the integrity and validity of signed PDF documents. Our goal was to evaluate whether these services could be successfully attacked using our attack classes.
