User: I'm learning to use airflow to schedule some python ETL processes. Each time I update my python code I have to restart the webserver and also rename the DAG before code changes are picked up by airflow. Is there anyway around this, especially so I dont have to be renaming my DAG each time I make changes?
Assistant: This has been an issue with the current version. What I usually do is to duplicate the DAG and change its name so it reflects in the web server. As soon as I finish developing I keep the last renamed and delete the old ones.
