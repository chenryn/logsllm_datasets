I could start it easily from a terminal as a background process in Fedora 23
(using ampersand). However, after an upgrade to 0.10.6 (64bit), it freezes
soon after opening. It was not the case in the previous versions.
I suspect it might be related to the git integration somehow. It freezes if a
folder is under git source control. It does not freeze otherwise. When I run
it with the verbose option, it stops right before prompting for my repository
credentials (which it normally does if not frozen).
