User: I have installed both libxml2 and libxslt with homebrew, but it doesn't want to install libxml2-dev or libxslt-dev:
Error: No available formula for libxml2-dev
I have pip, port, and all I could found. I even installed the Xcode command line tools, 
but with no luck. What is the way to install libxml2-dev & libxslt-dev on Mac 10.10?
Assistant: I had the same problem and installing the Command Line Tools fixed the problem for me.
I just wanted to note, that calling xcode-select -p
and getting the output /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
does not tell if Xcode Command Line Tools are installed (like stated in the comments on the question)!
For me it returned the same output but xcode-select --install started the installation. After the installation xcode-select --install printed xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use "Software Update" to install updates
So to check if command line tools are installed better use xcode-select --install.
