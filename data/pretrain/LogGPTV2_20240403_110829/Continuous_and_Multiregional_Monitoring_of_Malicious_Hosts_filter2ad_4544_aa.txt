major methods to achieve these objectives, and many studies have 
been conducted on that. However, attackers utilize various evasion 
strategies to avoid monitoring by researchers. For example, they use 
cloaking based on accessed country/IP address or short-term acti-
vation of a C2 server. This enables the criminal to evade existing 
single-point  monitoring  and/or  short-term  monitoring.  To  over-
come these evasion strategies and to reveal cyberattacks activities, 
we propose Stargazer, a platform that effectively monitors potential 
malicious hosts using multiregional sensors on a long-term basis. 
Monitoring from multiple points can prevent cloaking. In addition, 
it enables cloaking detection by comparing the monitoring results 
and  by  detecting  the  difference  of  responses.  Furthermore,  it  re-
duces the risk of overlooking short-term activation through its con-
tinuous long-term monitoring. 
In this paper, we describe our implementation of a prototype of 
Stargazer. We conducted a study using seven sensors by monitoring 
1,050  malicious  hosts  from  Dec.  2018  to  Mar.  2020  and  obtained 
10,929,418  measurements.  In  a  preliminary  evaluation,  we  found 
that Stargazer overcame the aforementioned evasions and revealed 
cyberattacks. The contributions of this paper are as follows: 
  We designed and implemented Stargazer, a platform for moni-
toring malicious hosts.  
  We deployed a prototype of Stargazer and monitored a total of 
1,050 URLs in the wild Internet starting in Dec. 2018. 
  We found several characteristic cases: (1) revived hosts, (2) hosts 
that only respond to specific regions, and (3) the behavior of at-
tack preparation. These cases demonstrate Stargazer can over-
come monitoring evasion strategies and can reveal cyberattack 
activities. 
2.  DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY 
2.1  Goals 
Stargazer aims to reveal cyberattack activities from the viewpoint 
of  malicious  hosts.  To  achieve  this,  Stargazer  endeavors  to  over-
come some monitoring evasion strategies utilized by attackers. In 
addition, it has some sub goals: 
1.  To obtain not only a snapshot of the current status but also the 
state  transition  of  an  attacker’s  infrastructure  by  continuous 
monitoring. 
2.  To  discover  significantly  malicious  hosts,  requiring  priority 
treatment, e.g., the host needs to change his or her behavior de-
pending on the accessed country/organization, utilized for at-
tack over a long period of time.

ABSTRACT 
The number of cybersecurity threats has been increasing, and these 
threats have become more sophisticated year after year. Malicious 
hosts play a large role in modern cyberattacks, e.g., as a launcher of 
remote-control  attacks  or  as  a  receiver  of  stolen  information.  In 
such  circumstances,  continuous  monitoring  of  malicious  hosts 
(URL/IP addresses) is indispensable to reveal cyberattack activities, 
and many studies have been conducted on that. However, many of 
them have limitations: they help only in the short-term or they help 
only a few regions and/or a few organizations. Therefore, we cannot 
effectively monitor attacks that are active for only a short time or 
that change their behavior depending on where the victims are from 
(e.g., country/organization). In this paper, we propose Stargazer, a 
program that monitors malicious hosts from multiple points on a 
long-term basis. Multiregional monitoring sensors and inter-organ-
izational collaboration are conducted to achieve this surveillance. In 
this paper, we describe an implementation of the Stargazer proto-
type and how monitoring was carried out using multiregional sen-
sors starting in Dec. 2018 of 1,050 malicious hosts; 10,929,418 meas-
urements were obtained. Case studies on (1) revived hosts, (2) hosts 
that only respond to specific regions, and (3) the behavior of attack 
preparation were created.

2.2  Architecture 
Figure 1 shows an overview of Stargazer. To achieve the goals men-
tioned in Section 2.1, Stargazer monitors malicious hosts on a long-
term basis. It consists of command servers and multiregional sen-
sors, as shown in Figure 1. It monitors multiple regions and multiple 
organizations, revealing the activity of malicious hosts from various 
viewpoints. 
Stargazer monitors malicious hosts using the following steps: 
1.  The command server orders sensors to start monitoring period-
2.  Sensors carry out observations based on the order. 
3.  The observation results are stored into a command server's da-
