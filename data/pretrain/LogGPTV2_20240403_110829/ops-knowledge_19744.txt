User: I am wondering, is there a way to change the name of a script so that it is not called "python.exe" in the tasklist. The reason I am asking is that I am trying to make a batch file that run's a python script. I want the batch file to check to see if the script is already running. if the script is already running then the batch file will do nothing. Thanks
Assistant: This library does not work on Windows, and shouldn't be used in production code.  Manipulation the argv array is a rather dirty hack.
Generally I'd not try to identify processes by scanning the process table.  This is not really reliable, as process names aren't guaranteed to be unique.  Instead I'd spawn a simple server on localhost inside the python script.  If started, the script can then try to connect to the server, and quit, if the server is already running.  This approach can later on also be expanded to support any kind of IPC.
