User: Use Docker container technology to deploy web applications, enabling horizontal expansion and automated operation and maintenance.
Assistant: Docker container technology can easily package web applications into portable images. These images can run on any host that supports Docker and can be scaled horizontally as needed. Specifically, we can package the web application into a Docker image, and then use container orchestration tools (such as Kubernetes) on the cloud platform to deploy and manage these images. In this way, we can easily deploy web applications to multiple nodes, and automate operation and maintenance and expansion. In addition, Docker also provides many useful features, such as automated builds, automated deployments, fast container restarts, etc., which can make our web applications more robust and reliable. In conclusion, using Docker container technology to deploy web applications is a very effective way to improve application reliability and scalability while reducing operation and maintenance costs.
