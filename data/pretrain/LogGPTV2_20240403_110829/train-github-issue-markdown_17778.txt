Behavior in the vast majority of editors/programs is that if you execute the
'Copy' command (Control/Command + C) when no text is selected is that nothing
happens.
Atom instead copies the current line. There's already a nice duplicate-line
command, making the behavior not quite necessary.
The real annoyance is that many, many times I mean to press Ctrl-V but I press
Ctrl-C instead. So I lose my selection and have to go copy the original text
again.
