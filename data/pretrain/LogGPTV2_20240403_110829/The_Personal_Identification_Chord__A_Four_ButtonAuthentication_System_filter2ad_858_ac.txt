3. PIN/PIC memorization: Each participant was asked to enter
the correct PIN or PIC three times to help with memorization. If
incorrect PINs or PICs were entered five times consecutively, the
correct PIN or PIC was revealed again so that the participant would
have another chance to memorize it.
4. Puzzle: Each participant was asked to complete a moderately
challenging lexical and graphical puzzle, which takes about 3 min-
utes to complete.
5. Demographics questions: Each participant was asked de-
mographic questions such as ethnicity, age, gender and level of
education. We also asked questions about participants’ previous
experiences with smartwatches.
6. Recall: Each participant was asked to enter his or her chosen
PIN or PIC within five attempts. A failure to do so terminated the
study. To prevent the participants from cheating, we ensured they
did not look at any external storage during this or any other recall
stage.
7. Recall survey: Participants were asked to answer the survey
questions listed in Table 2. Only those who correctly recalled their
PIN or PIC were invited to the next stage.
8. Recall-hidden: Participants were asked to enter their PINs
or PICs within five attempts in an hidden input condition identical
to that used in the hidden condition in the second study.
9. Recall-hidden survey: Participants answered the survey
questions listed in Table 2. Only those who correctly entered their
PIN/PIC in stage 8 were invited to the next stage.
10. Day2-Recall: Steps 6 through 9 were repeated 24 hours later
in the second recall test. If participants successfully completed this
recall test, they were given the additional USD 5 “sweet” voucher.
The 24 hour break period in this study (between steps 9 and
10) was selected to reflect the real-world smartwatch unlocking
frequencies captured in our initial interviews: the longest interval
between two consecutive watch donning (unlocking) routines was
24 hours. The study structure also reflects the Atkinson-Shiffrin
dual memory model [1]. This model postulates that human mem-
ories initially reside in a “short-term” memory for a limited time
(20 to 30 seconds). Short-term memory has limited capacity and

older items are wiped as new items enter. Further, rehearsing or
recalling items while they are in the short-term memory causes the
items to stay longer in the short-term memory. Based on Atkinson-
Shiffrin memory model, the memorization tasks in stage 3 will help
participants remember their selected PINs or PICs. The puzzle in
stage 4 is intended to wipe out the short-term memory of selected
PIN or PIC information. Subsequently, the participants were asked
to complete two sessions of recall tests to check whether they can
remember their PINs or PICs.
5.1.5 User data collected. Throughout the study, we recorded
the following information:
Selected PIN/PIC policy: For each participant, we recorded
the selected PIN or PIC and the assigned policy.
Setup time: We measured the time it took participants to set
up their PINs or PICs, starting from when they first saw the input
screen and ending when they successfully met all policy require-
ments and confirmed their PINs or PICs.
Unlock attempts: For recall and recall-hidden tests on both
days, we recorded the number of attempts each participant made
in entering the selected PIN or PIC.
Unlock time: For recall and recall-hidden tests on both days,
we measured the time it took each participant to complete an au-
thentication attempt. We divided this into preparation time and
entry time. Preparation time started when the unlock screen was
displayed and finished on the first tap to the screen. Entry time
started from the participant’s first touch of the screen and ended
when the participant either entered the correct PIN or PIC, or failed
to enter the PIN or PIC within five attempts.
Recall rate: For all of the recall and recall-hidden tests, we
recorded whether a correct PIN or PIC was entered for each attempt
made.
Survey answers: We recorded the participants’ responses to
the survey questions in Table 2.
5.2 Results
5.2.1 Demographics. A total of 120 participants completed the
first day sessions tests; all returned for the second day. 30 were
assigned to each policy. System errors caused setup times to be
lost for four participants (all from the PIC-free policy) and data
for one participant’s day two recall session was corrupt (in the
PIN-original policy). All of the participants were Asian, in the
18–29 age group, with a mean of 23, and 52.5% were male. 83.3% had
a high school diploma, 15% had a university degree, and 1.7% had a
Master or Doctoral degree. We recruited individuals regardless of
their ownership of or previous experiences with smartwatches. Six

5.2.2 Practice. We opted to analyze all trials in the practice
condition to better characterize the usability of PICs when users
are first exposed to them. To minimize the number of tests, we first
calculated task-time as the sum of preparation and touch time, then
removed a single outlier participant (more than three SDs from the
mean). Error data were analyzed as in the second study. All data
from this session are shown in Table 3. A two-way mixed methods
ANOVA on task-time indicated all effects were significant: the

p =
0.09). The strong effect in the interaction indicates that while PICs
were slower to enter in the shown condition, this difference was
absent in the hidden condition. Error data failed normality tests, but
showed a significant main effect of GUI using CI corrected Kruskal-
2(1) = 6.2, p = 0.01). As PIC error data are flat across the
Wallis (χ
GUI condition, we attribute this effect to the steep increase in errors
in the PIN condition. These findings mirror those from the second
study and serve to reinforce the idea that participants were capable
users of the PIC technique from the outset. Despite receiving less
training, the participants performed well (error rates are slightly
lower than in the second study) including in challenging input
conditions, such as the hidden GUI condition, where traditional
input techniques, such as PIN, suffered a sharp uptick in error rate.
Setup time. As shown in Table 4, the mean time taken
to set up a PIN or PIC varied considerably: from a mean of 11.1
seconds with PIN-original to 45 seconds with PIC-dual. The
main effect of these differences was significant with a Kruskal-
2(3) = 42.23, p < 0.001). Corrected post-hoc tests showed

5.2.4 Recall rate, time, and attempts. We calculated and analyzed
the proportion of participants who successfully recalled their PINs
or PICs in the two recall tests and two recall-hidden tests to compare
the recall effects of the four policies. A single participant in the
PIC-dual-rand policy failed the recall test on day 2. There was no
statistically significant difference in any of the polices (all p = 1.0,
corrected FET).
