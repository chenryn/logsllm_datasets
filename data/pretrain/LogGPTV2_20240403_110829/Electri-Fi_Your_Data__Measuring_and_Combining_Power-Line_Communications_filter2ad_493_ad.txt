**Longer Timescale Analysis: Throughput and PLC Performance Variability**

We have observed that throughput can reach up to 4 Mbps. To further investigate, we now analyze longer timescales, specifically in terms of minutes and hours, with two main objectives:
1. Determine if some links can be probed at a slower rate, thereby reducing overhead.
2. Characterize the variability of Power Line Communication (PLC) performance under high and low electrical loads.

To study the channel quality variation over random time scales, we conducted tests over extended periods, including two days and two weeks, for various links. During these tests, we measured throughput, BLE, and Packet Bit Error Rate (PBER) every second. We denote the mean of BLE as \( \mu \) (calculated as \( \frac{\sum_{s=1}^{6} \text{BLE}_s}{6} \)) and its standard deviation as \( \sigma \).

**Figures 12-14: Results of Our Measurements**

**Link Quality vs. Time:**
- The variation in \( \mu \) is influenced by the electrical load. As the number of switched-on devices increases (e.g., during working hours), the attenuation increases, and \( \mu \) decreases, as discussed in Section 5.

**Link Quality vs. Variability:**
- Figures 13 and 14 show the differences in y-axis scales, which represent good and bad links, respectively. For a given link, the random-scale variation of \( \sigma \) is strongly dependent on the noise from attached electrical devices. \( \sigma \) is higher when \( \mu \) is lower, indicating more devices are switched on, producing more noise, or frequent switching, creating impulsive noise. Good links have a very small \( \sigma \), which increases as the link quality (i.e., \( \mu \)) decreases.

**Link Probing:**
- Good links exhibit a negligible standard deviation, suggesting they can be probed every minute or hour, depending on the time of day.

**Capacity Estimation Process for PLC**

As mentioned in Section 2.1, stations estimate a tone map only if they have data to send. To estimate link metrics, a few unicast probe packets must be sent. In Section 6, we discuss how fast the capacity changes given the link quality by sending saturated traffic. Here, we examine how capacity can be estimated with a few probe packets and explore the size and frequency of these packets.

**7.1 BLE as a Capacity Estimator**

First, we demonstrate that BLE, included in the header of every PLC frame, accurately estimates the capacity of any PLC link. We repeated saturated tests for our 144 links over a duration of 4 minutes. Figure 15 presents the measured throughput and BLE. We observe that BLE is an exact estimation of the actual throughput received by the application. Let \( T \) be the average throughput. Fitting a line to the data points, we get \( \text{BLE} = 1.7T - 0.65 \). We verified that the residuals are normally distributed.

**Capacity Estimation Using BLE and Probe Packets:**
- To conduct a capacity estimation using BLE, a few packets per mains cycle and estimation interval should be captured, based on our temporal variation study in Section 6.1. An alternative technique uses Management Messages (MMs) to request the instantaneous BLE. PLC devices provide statistics of the average BLE used over all 6 tone map slots. Probe packets need not be sent at all sub-intervals of the mains cycle, as the channel estimation process yields a BLE for all slots when at least one packet is sent.

**Effect of Number of Probes:**
- We explored whether the number of probes affects the estimation. Before each run, we reset the devices. Experiments were conducted to estimate the capacity by sending a limited number of packets (1-200 packets per second) of size 1300B. Figure 16 shows that the estimated capacity converges to a value independent of the number of packets sent; however, the number of packets sent per second affects the convergence time to the real estimation. The channel-estimation algorithm has a large convergence time to the optimal allocation of bits per symbol for all carriers, as it requires many samples from many packets to estimate the error for every frequency. This convergence time depends on the (vendor-specific) channel-estimation algorithm and the initial estimation (which was reset by us).

**Conclusion:**
- Good links can be probed every minute or hour, depending on the time of day, due to their negligible standard deviation.

**Note:**
- The probe packets can be of any size. PLC always transmits at least a Physical Block (PB) of 500B, using padding if necessary.

**Figure 16: Estimated Capacity for Two Links and Different Number of Packet-Probes per Second**
- **X-axis:** Time (s)
- **Y-axis:** Estimated capacity (Mbps)
- **Legend:**
  - 1 packet/s
  - 10 packet/s
  - 50 packet/s
  - 200 packet/s

**Observation:**
- The estimated capacity converges to a value that does not depend on the number of packets sent, but the convergence time is affected by the number of packets sent per second.

**Next Steps:**
- To evaluate the convergence time in realistic scenarios, further experiments will be conducted.
