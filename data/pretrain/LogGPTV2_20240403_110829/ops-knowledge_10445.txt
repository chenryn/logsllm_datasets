Get the code You can get the code from the remote warehouse by using the `git clone` command. ```bash $ git clone https://github.com/github_user/project.git ``` 3. Add files to the temporary storage area Files can be added to the Git temporary storage area by using the `git add` command. ```bash $ git add filename ``` 4. Submit the code You can submit the code to the Git repository by using the `git commit` command. ```bash $ git commit -m "commit message" ``` 5. Check the status of the warehouse You can check the status of the Git warehouse by using the command `git status`. ```bash $ git status ``` 6. View the modified file You can view the modified file content by using the `git diff` command. ```bash $ git diff ``` 7. View the commit history By using the `git log` command, you can view the commit history of the Git repository. ```bash $ git log ``` 8. Roll back to the specified commit You can roll back to the specified commit by using the `git reset` command. ```bash $ git reset commit_id ``` 9.
