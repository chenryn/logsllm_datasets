### Dianping: Social Interactions and Sybil Detection

On Dianping, a reviewer can send a virtual flower to another reviewer as a form of compliment for posting a well-crafted review. However, we consider these social interactions among reviewers to be weak and extraneous for characterizing elite Sybil users. Instead, we utilize user-community structures as a lens to conduct a detailed micro-macro analysis of elite Sybil users without relying on any user profile information.

### Related Work

In this section, we survey the methodologies used in previous research, categorizing them into four main approaches: graph-based, feature-based, aggregate behavioral-based clustering, and crowdsourcing-based. We review each approach below.

#### Graph-Based Approaches

Graph-based detection methods model accounts as nodes and social links between accounts as edges. For example, Liu et al. [26] examined the dynamic changes in the social graph. Prior work [10, 18, 28] assumes that in a social graph, there are a limited number of attack edges connecting benign and Sybil users. The underlying insight is that it is difficult for attackers to establish connections with real users, and strong trust is lacking in real online social networks (OSNs) like RenRen [47] and Facebook [5, 8, 12, 22]. Souche [46] and Anti-Reconnaissance [31] also rely on the assumption that the social network structure alone can distinguish real users from Sybil users. Unfortunately, this assumption has been proven unrealistic, as real users tend to avoid interacting with unknown accounts [37]. Recent research [7] relaxes these assumptions by combining victim prediction with weighted graphs and performing short random walks to classify users. However, we argue that these methods are less effective in User-Review Social Networks (URSNs) due to the lack of tight connectivity among nodes compared to general OSNs.

#### Feature-Based Approaches

Feature-based approaches leverage behavioral patterns, which can be easily encoded and analyzed using machine learning techniques. Different classes of features are commonly used to capture various dimensions of user behavior [13, 24, 32, 34, 35, 43]. Some studies [33, 38, 39] incorporate content information such as reviews, wall posts, hashtags, and URLs to filter out Sybil users. For instance, the Facebook Immune System [35] detects Sybil users based on features derived from user profiles and activities. COMPA [13] identifies compromised accounts through sudden change alerts. Additionally, Song et al. [34] proposed a target-based detection method for Twitter, focusing on retweet features. However, feature-based approaches are relatively easy to evade through adversarial attacks [4, 9, 42, 51], and further work is needed to detect more sophisticated strategies that blend realistic and Sybil user features.

#### Aggregate Behavioral-Based Clustering Approaches

Recent research [3, 11, 16, 29, 40, 43] focuses on detecting clusters of users rather than individual users. For example, CopyCatch [3] and SynchroTrap [11] use mixed approaches and achieve lower false positive rates compared to single feature-based methods. On Dianping, elite Sybil users write elaborate reviews mimicking real ones and manipulate review temporal patterns within a Sybil campaign to bypass detection.

#### Crowdsourcing-Based Approaches

Wang et al. [44] tested the efficacy of crowdsourcing for detecting Sybil accounts using human annotators and online workers. They observed that the detection rate for hired workers decreases over time, although majority voting can compensate for this. However, two drawbacks limit the feasibility of this approach: (i) it may not be cost-effective for large-scale networks like Facebook and Dianping; (ii) exposing personal information to external workers raises privacy concerns [14]. Some recent work [23, 32, 34] discusses identifying regular Sybil users in URSNs using crowdsourcing or model-based detection [25], but these methods have limited applicability. Recent research leverages Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to generate synthetic Yelp reviews [48]. However, ELSIEDET is immune to AI attacks because: (i) it does not use contextual features that RNN-based attacks exploit; (ii) the attack dataset in [48] does not include human-crafted fake reviews, suggesting that the proposed defense [48] cannot effectively identify elite Sybil user reviews. Our research is the first to define, characterize, and perform a large-scale empirical study of elite Sybil attacks in URSNs, providing a supplement to traditional Sybil detection schemes and insights into novel detection systems.

### Conclusion

This paper highlights the threat of large-scale Sybil activities in User-Review Social Networks. We demonstrated that Sybil organizations on Dianping use a hybrid cascading hierarchy to orchestrate campaigns. An in-depth analysis of elite Sybil users revealed that they are more spread out temporally, produce better-edited content, and have fewer reviews filtered. We showed that most Sybil campaigns can be detected within the first two weeks by monitoring elite Sybil users. Notably, we also found that Sybil organizations distort online ratings, rendering previous research outdated. Sophisticated manipulation of temporal patterns is key to their evasive strategy. Finally, we demonstrated that ELSIEDET is highly effective and scalable as a standalone system. Although our study focused on Dianping, we believe that the anti-Sybil defense examined here provides an opportunity for all URSNs to combat the spread of elite Sybil users.
