It would be nice to add more flexibility to the form:errors tag.  
E.g. to render something like
error1  
error2  
With element="ul" a part can be implemented but the  element is not
possible.  
The delimiter attribute just outputs it content after eacht error.
Maybe the form:errors tag can be extended with something like errorElement or
itemElement indicating a wrapper element for the each error.
Something like this:
