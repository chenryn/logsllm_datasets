Question: "In the context of Android app development, an app team argues against implementing APK Signature Scheme v3 because they believe it will cause their app to be blocked by other apps that trust the current signing certificate. What is the most appropriate counterargument to this concern?"
 "A": "The APK Signature Scheme v3 does not support key rotation, hence other apps will not recognize any changes to the signing certificate."
 "B": "The proof-of-rotation struct in APK Signature Scheme v3 actually allows apps to rotate their signing certificate without being blocked by other apps, ensuring trust continuity."
 "C": "Other apps will automatically trust the new signing certificate as the APK Signature Scheme v3 includes a feature that universally updates the trust stores of all Android devices."
 "D": "The APK Signature Scheme v3 requires manual intervention for every app to update their trust stores, which guarantees that no app will be automatically blocked."
Answer: B
