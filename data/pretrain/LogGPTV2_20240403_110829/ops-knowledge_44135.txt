User: How can i copy a .exe file through python? I tried to read the file and then write the contents to another but everytime i try to open the file it say ioerror is directory. Any input is appreciated.
EDIT:
ok i've read through the comments and i'll edit my code and see what happens. If i still get an error i'll post my code.
Assistant: Windows Vista and 7 will restrict your access to files installed into the Programs directories. Unless you run with UAC privileges you will never be able to open them.
I hope I'm interpreting your error properly. In the future it is best to copy and paste the actual error message into your question.
