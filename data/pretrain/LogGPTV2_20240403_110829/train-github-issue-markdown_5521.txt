SQLAlchemy refuses the following declaration:
        ok = Column(Boolean, nullable=False, default=False, server_default=False)
You have to use the following instead, but I'm not sure it's portable (and
it's also less natural to type):
        ok = Column(Boolean, nullable=False, default=False, server_default="0")
