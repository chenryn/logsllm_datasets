### How to Fix the Right-Click Bug in the Navbar (Disappears) in Firefox

To resolve the issue where right-clicking on the navbar causes it to disappear in Firefox, you need to modify the `dropdown.js` file. Follow these steps:

1. **Locate the File:**
   - Open the `dropdown.js` file in your code editor.

2. **Find the Code:**
   - Navigate to line 142 of the `dropdown.js` file.

3. **Replace the Code:**
   - Replace the existing code with the following updated code:

   ```javascript
   // Old code:
   .on('click.bs.dropdown.data-api', clearMenus)

   // New code:
   .on('click.bs.dropdown.data-api', function(e) {
       if (e.button === 2) {
           clearMenus();
       }
   });
   ```

4. **Explanation:**
   - The new code checks if the click event is a right-click (`e.button === 2`). If it is, the `clearMenus` function is called. This ensures that the navbar does not disappear when right-clicked.

5. **Save and Test:**
   - Save the changes to the `dropdown.js` file.
   - Reload your application in Firefox and test the right-click functionality to ensure the bug is fixed.

By making this change, you should be able to prevent the navbar from disappearing when right-clicked in Firefox.
