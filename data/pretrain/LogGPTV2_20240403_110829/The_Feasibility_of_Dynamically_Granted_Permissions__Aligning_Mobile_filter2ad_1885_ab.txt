### Roaming Settings

#### Table I: Permissions for Runtime Prompts
Felt et al. proposed granting a select set of 12 permissions at runtime, providing users with contextual information to infer why the data might be needed [15]. Our instrumentation omits the last two permission types (INTERNET and WRITE_SYNC_SETTINGS) and records information about the other 10.

#### User Responses to Permission Prompts
Felt et al. observed that privacy decisions are highly nuanced, indicating that a one-size-fits-all model is insufficient. Different users may have different opinions on the same information flow. They recommended using machine learning to infer individual users’ privacy preferences. To achieve this, research is needed to determine the factors affecting user privacy decisions and how to use these factors to make privacy decisions on behalf of the user. While we cannot capture all aspects of Nissenbaum’s notion of context, we can detect when the context has likely changed, thereby deciding whether a different privacy decision should be made for the same application and data type.

### Methodology

We collected data from 131 participants to understand what factors could be used to infer whether a permission request is likely to be deemed appropriate by the user.

#### Previous Work
Felt et al. argued that certain permissions are suitable for runtime prompts because they protect sensitive resources and provide additional contextual information [15]. Thompson et al. showed that other permission requests could be replaced with audit mechanisms, as they represent either reversible changes or low-risk actions [41]. We focused on 10 of the 12 permissions suggested by Felt et al. for runtime prompts, omitting INTERNET and WRITE_SYNC_SETTINGS, as these only warrant runtime prompts if the user is roaming, which was not expected during our study period.

#### Data Collection
We used the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) to collect ground truth data about users’ privacy preferences [20]. ESM involves repeatedly questioning participants in situ about a recently observed event. In our case, we probabilistically asked participants about an application’s recent access to their phone data and whether they would have permitted it if given the choice. Participants' responses to these ESM probes served as our main dependent variable (Figure 1).

#### Instrumentation
Our goal was to collect as much runtime and behavioral data as possible from the Android platform with minimal performance cost. We collected three categories of data: behavioral information, runtime information, and user decisions. We made no modifications to any third-party application code; our dynamic analysis techniques could be used on any third-party Android application.

Table II lists the complete set of behavioral and runtime events recorded. The behavioral data included web-browsing habits, screen locking behavior, third-party application usage, audio preferences, call habits, camera usage patterns, and security settings. For example, we hypothesized that someone who manually locks their device screen is more privacy-conscious than someone who lets it time out.

We also collected runtime information about the context of each permission request, including the visibility of the requesting application, the foreground application, and the specific Android API function invoked. The visibility of an application indicates the extent to which the user was aware that the application was running. If the application was in the foreground, the user had cues that the application was running; if it was in the background, the user was likely unaware, making the permission request unexpected.

We monitored processes’ memory priority levels to determine the visibility of all Android processes and collected information about the active Android Activity. Once per day, we probabilistically selected one permission request and prompted the user about it at runtime (Figure 1). We used weighted reservoir sampling to select the permission request, with the most frequent combinations having a higher probability of being shown. We prompted participants a maximum of three times for each unique combination, ensuring that their response would not affect the system.

#### Exit Survey
At the end of the data collection period, PhoneLab staff emailed participants a link to an online exit survey, incentivized with a raffle for two $100 Amazon gift cards. The survey gathered demographic information and qualitative data on privacy preferences. Of the 203 participants, 53 fully completed the survey, and another 14 partially completed it. Participants ranged from 20 to 72 years of age (mean = 40.83, standard deviation = 14.32). Only 21% of respondents had an academic qualification in STEM, suggesting a diverse sample.

#### Summary
Data was collected from February 5 to March 17, 2016. Of the 203 participants who installed our custom Android build, 131 used it for more than 20 days. During the study period, we collected 176 million events across all participants (31,000 events per participant/day). Our dataset includes 1,686 unique applications and 13,000 unique activities. Participants responded to 4,636 prompts, and we logged 96 million sensitive permission requests, translating to one request every 6 seconds per participant. For the remainder of the paper, we consider data from the 131 participants who used the system for at least 20 days, corresponding to 4,224 ESM prompts.

Of the 4,224 prompts, 55.3% were for ACCESS_WIFI_STATE, 21.0% for accessing location directly, 17.3% for reading SMS, 5.08% for sending SMS, 0.78% for reading call logs, and 0.54% for accessing browser history. A total of 137 unique applications triggered prompts. Participants wanted to deny 60.01% of the prompts, and 57.65% of the prompts were shown when the requesting application was in the foreground or the user had visual cues. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed a statistically significant difference in participants' desire to allow or deny a permission request based on the visibility of the requesting application (p < 0.0152, r = 0.221), corroborating previous findings [43].

### Types of Users

We hypothesized that there may be different types of users based on how they want to disclose private information to third parties. Identifying these sub-populations is crucial, as different permission models affect users differently based on their privacy preferences.

While our study size was too small for effective clustering, we found a meaningful distinction using the denial rate (the percentage of prompts to which users wanted to deny access). We aggregated users by their denial rate in 10% increments and examined how different participants considered surrounding contextual circumstances in their decisions.

We discovered that application visibility was a significant factor for users with a denial rate of 10–90%, but not for users with a denial rate of 0–10% or 90–100%. We call the former group "Contextuals," as they make nuanced decisions based on contextual cues, and the latter group "Defaulters," who always allow or deny requests regardless of contextual cues.

Defaulters accounted for 53% of the 131 participants, and Contextuals accounted for 47%. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test confirmed the significance of this distinction (Figure 2).

- **Contextuals**: Considered the visibility of the requesting application.
- **Defaulters**: Allowed or denied almost all requests without regard for contextual cues.
