Assistant: This log chunk shows a user accessing the website www.baidu.com through a proxy server proxy.cse.cuhk.edu.hk:5070. The user then accesses t12.baidu.com, sclick.baidu.com, cpro.baidustatic.com, bdimg.share.baidu.com, suggestion.baidu.com, f12.baidu.com, c.csdnimg.cn, and avatar.csdn.net. The user then attempts to access csdnimg.cn and hm.baidu.com, but the connection is canceled before completion.
