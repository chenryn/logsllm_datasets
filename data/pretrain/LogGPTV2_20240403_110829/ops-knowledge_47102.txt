User: How to configure Nginx as a reverse proxy server in Linux system? Please provide specific steps and a sample configuration file.
Assistant: Steps: 1. Install Nginx Install Nginx in Linux using the following command: ``` sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install nginx ``` 2. Configure Nginx Modify the Nginx configuration file `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` file to make it a reverse proxy server: ``` user nginx; worker_processes auto; error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log; pid /run/nginx.pid; events { worker_connections 1024; } http { server { listen 80; server_name example.com; location / { proxy_pass http://localhost:8000; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; `server_name` and `proxy_pass` need to be modified according to your specific needs. 3. Restart Nginx After completing the configuration, use the following command to restart Nginx: ``` sudo service nginx restart ``` Example configuration file: ``` user nginx; worker_processes auto; error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log; pid /run/nginx.pid; events { worker_connections 1024; } http { server { listen 80; server_name example.com; location / { proxy_pass http://localhost:8000; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $ remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; } } } ``` In this example configuration file, Nginx will receive requests from `example.com` and forward them to the local `8000` port. During this process, Nginx sets some HTTP header information to ensure that the source IP address and the real request address can be delivered correctly.
