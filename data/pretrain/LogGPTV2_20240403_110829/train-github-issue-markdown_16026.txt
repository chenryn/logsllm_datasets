##### Summary:
Hi,  
I need to dump all the vars available at certain steps of playbook so I tried
to follow this tip.  
At first it looks like it does what I need but then I noticed that dumping
`vars` gives me variables specified only in role's vars file and no vars
inherited from `group_vars/`.  
Inspecting `lib/ansible/runner/__init__.py` I see this:
    # use combined_cache and host_variables to template the module_vars                  
    # we update the inject variables with the data we're about to template               
    # since some of the variables we'll be replacing may be contained there too          
    module_vars_inject = utils.combine_vars(host_variables, combined_cache.get(host, {}))
    module_vars_inject = utils.combine_vars(self.module_vars, module_vars_inject)        
    module_vars = template.template(self.basedir, self.module_vars, module_vars_inject)
and I see that vars inherited from `group_vars` are contained in
`host_variables`.  
Now I'm in doubt whether they should get in `module_vars` here and there's
just a bug at this point  
or they should not and then I'd like to add them later to `inject` dict like
it's done with `module_vars`:
    inject['vars']        = self.module_vars
