### Task: Document the `config.clientBootstrap` Configuration Option

**Summary:**
The recently introduced configuration option for adding a custom bootstrap file to the main bundle has only been mentioned in scattered comments. To improve clarity and accessibility, this task aims to formally document the `config.clientBootstrap` option.

- I have searched the issues in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

## Expected Behavior
- **Documentation:** The `config.clientBootstrap` option should be documented in the main README.
- **Example:** An example demonstrating how to use this option should be included. A common use case, such as including `babel-polyfill`, would be beneficial and could help address issues like #2468.

**Note:** It appears that there are no tests currently exercising this configuration option. This can be considered a separate task from the documentation updates.

## Important Considerations
- **Limitations of the Config Option:** It's important to note that the `config.clientBootstrap` option does not cover all use cases. For example, I attempted to add an EventSource polyfill for `webpack-hot-middleware` to enable development mode in IE11. However, the custom bootstrap file is injected too late, making it ineffective for such polyfills.

By addressing these points, we can ensure that users have clear and comprehensive guidance on using the `config.clientBootstrap` option, while also being aware of its limitations.
