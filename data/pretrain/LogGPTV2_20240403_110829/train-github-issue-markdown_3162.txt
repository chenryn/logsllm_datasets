The recently added config option for adding a custom bootstrap file to the
main bundle is mentioned only in comments here and there so far, so thought to
turn this into an actual task for clarity.
References:
  * #2969 (comment)
  * #1556 (comment)
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
I'd expect to
  * find `config.clientBootstrap` documented in main README
  * find an example showing how to use this (suggestion: use something common like babel-polyfill in the example to help issues such as #2468)
As a side note, it seems that there are no tests exercising this config
option, but perhaps that can be seen as a different task than these docs.
## Notes
Something to be aware of with this config (and the docs): sadly this option
does not help with everything. I tried to add EventSource polyfill for
webpack-hot-middleware to make the dev mode work in IE11, but this custom
bootstrap is injected too late and thus it does not help with this kind of
polyfilling.
