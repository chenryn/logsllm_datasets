## Abstract
Internet services use transport protocol port numbers to specify the source and destination application layer protocols. While using port 0 is generally prohibited in most transport protocols, a non-negligible amount of traffic uses this port in the Internet.

In this study, we analyze port 0 traffic to infer its origins and causes using five complementary flow-level and packet-level datasets. We observe 73 GB of port 0 traffic in one week of IXP traffic, with most of it identified as an artifact of packet fragmentation. In our packet-level datasets, most traffic originates from a small number of hosts, and while most packets have no payload, a significant fraction of those with payload belong to the BitTorrent protocol. Additionally, we find unique traffic patterns commonly associated with scanning activities.

We also conduct active measurements to study how different networks react to port 0 traffic. Our findings show an unexpectedly high response rate for TCP port 0 probes in IPv4, with very low response rates for other protocol types. Finally, we will continue to run periodic port 0 measurements and provide the results to the research community.

## 1. Introduction
Transport protocols use port numbers to identify different Internet services. Common examples include TCP/80 and TCP/443 for the web, TCP/25 for SMTP, and UDP/443 for QUIC. Port numbers are categorized into officially registered ports at IANA, unofficial but well-known ports, and dynamic ports that can be used freely. However, some ports, such as port 0, are reserved and should not be used. Port 0 is reserved in common transport layer protocols like TCP, UDP, UDP-Lite, and SCTP. When attempting to bind to port 0, operating systems typically choose a free port from the dynamic range. Therefore, creating a raw socket is necessary to send port 0 packets.

Previous studies have shown a non-negligible share of traffic using port 0 in both darknets and the Internet. In this work, we analyze real-world network traffic and perform active measurements to better understand port 0 traffic characteristics and origins. This is the first study to combine both active and passive measurements to investigate port 0 traffic in the Internet. Our main contributions are:

- **Flow-Level Analysis:** We use a dataset from a large European IXP to inspect the origins of port 0 traffic. We find that out of the top 10 ASes originating port 0 traffic, the majority does not follow typical diurnal patterns of common protocols like TCP/80.
- **Packet-Level Analysis:** We examine four packet-level datasets to discover the actual contents and detailed characteristics of port 0 packets. Most non-empty UDP packets are related to BitTorrent, while most TCP packets do not contain any payload and are one-way. The two-way TCP streams are primarily artifacts of scanning activities.
- **Active Measurements:** We perform active measurements in both IPv4 and IPv6 to gain insights into port 0 responsive IP addresses. We find a substantial number of responsive hosts in a small number of ASes for IPv4 TCP traffic. We also conduct traceroute-style active measurements to understand port 0 traffic filtering and find discrepancies between IPv4 and IPv6. We will continue to run periodic port 0 measurements and make the results available to the research community.

## 2. Related Work
Reynolds and Postel specified in 1983 that port number 0 is reserved in TCP and UDP. Similar provisions were later introduced for other transport protocols. Traffic sent to or from port 0 thus violates these specifications. Most reports on port 0 traffic are associated with DDoS attacks and malformed packets. Despite the presence of port 0 traffic in the Internet, there is limited research on its root causes.

Bou-Harb et al. [9] studied port 0 traffic on 30 GB of darknet data, filtering out misconfigured traffic and packets with non-conforming TCP flags. They found that over 97% of the identified port 0 traffic was related to probing activities, some orchestrated by malware.

Luchs and Doerr [29] analyzed three years of data from a /15 darknet, finding that out of about 33,000 source IP addresses involved in port 0 traffic, 10% could be attributed to DDoS attacks, 6% to OS fingerprinting, and less than 1% to scanning activities. When aggregated by the number of packets, scanning traffic dominated with 48% of all port 0 packets.

Maghsoudlou et al. [30] analyzed port 0 traffic for a single passive measurement source and found that a small number of ASes were responsible for about half of all port 0 traffic.

In contrast to previous studies, which focused on a single passive data source, this paper analyzes four complementary passive datasets and conducts an active measurement campaign to better understand port 0 traffic in the wild.

## 3. Datasets Overview
We use two types of passive datasets to study port 0 traffic characteristics: flow-level and packet-level data. Port 0 traffic refers to traffic where either the source port, destination port, or both are set to zero. Flow-level data provides a high-level overview of Internet traffic, while packet-level data allows for detailed analysis of fragmentation, header flags, and payloads.

### Datasets Used:
- **IXP:** One week of sampled IPFIX data from a large European IXP captured at the end of January 2020.
- **MAWI:**
  - **MAWI-long:** Monthly 15-minute snapshots from January 2007 to July 2020.
  - **MAWI-short:** Data from April 8–9, 2020, part of the Day in the Life of the Internet project.
- **CAIDA:** Anonymized packet traces without payload from CAIDA’s passive monitors, specifically the one-hour period from 14:00–15:00 UTC on January 17, 2019.
- **Waikato:** Packet header traces including the first few bytes of payload, captured at the border of the University of Waikato network in New Zealand.

### Active Measurements:
- **Port Scan:** Using ZMap and ZMapv6 to find responsive addresses on port 0. In IPv4, we conduct Internet-wide measurements, and in IPv6, we use an IPv6 hitlist.
- **Traceroute:** Using Yarrp to traceroute addresses in IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes to analyze port 0 traffic filtering.

### Ethical Considerations
Before conducting active measurements, we follow an internal multi-party approval process, incorporating proposals by Partridge and Allman [36] and Dittrich et al. [15]. We adhere to scanning best practices by limiting our probing rate, maintaining a blocklist, and using dedicated servers with informed consent.

## 4. Flow-Level Analysis
We analyze one week of IPFIX data from a large European IXP to inspect the origins of port 0 traffic. Out of the top 10 ASes originating port 0 traffic, the majority does not follow typical diurnal patterns of common protocols like TCP/80.

## 5. Packet-Level Analysis
We examine four packet-level datasets to discover the actual contents and detailed characteristics of port 0 packets. Most non-empty UDP packets are related to BitTorrent, while most TCP packets do not contain any payload and are one-way. The two-way TCP streams are primarily artifacts of scanning activities.

## 6. Active Measurement Results
We perform active measurements in both IPv4 and IPv6 to gain insights into port 0 responsive IP addresses. We find a substantial number of responsive hosts in a small number of ASes for IPv4 TCP traffic. We also conduct traceroute-style active measurements to understand port 0 traffic filtering and find discrepancies between IPv4 and IPv6. We will continue to run periodic port 0 measurements and make the results available to the research community.
