Abstract. Internet services leverage transport protocol port numbers
to specify the source and destination application layer protocols. While
using port 0 is not allowed in most transport protocols, we see a non-
negligible share of traﬃc using port 0 in the Internet.
In this study, we dissect port 0 traﬃc to infer its possible origins and
causes using ﬁve complementing ﬂow-level and packet-level datasets. We
observe 73 GB of port 0 traﬃc in one week of IXP traﬃc, most of which
we identify as an artifact of packet fragmentation. In our packet-level
datasets, most traﬃc is originated from a small number of hosts and
while most of the packets have no payload, a major fraction of pack-
ets containing payload belong to the BitTorrent protocol. Moreover, we
ﬁnd unique traﬃc patterns commonly seen in scanning. In addition to
analyzing passive traces, we also conduct an active measurement cam-
paign to study how diﬀerent networks react to port 0 traﬃc. We ﬁnd an
unexpectedly high response rate for TCP port 0 probes in IPv4, with
very low response rates with other protocol types. Finally, we will be
running continuous port 0 measurements and providing the results to
the measurement community.
1 Introduction
Transport protocols use port numbers to identify diﬀerent Internet services.
Common port numbers are TCP/80 and TCP/443 for the Web, TCP/25 for
SMTP, or UDP/443 for QUIC. There are diﬀerent categories of port numbers:
Oﬃcially registered ports at IANA [23], unoﬃcially but well-known ports, and
dynamic ports, which cannot be registered and are free to use by anyone. In con-
trast, there are also some ports which are reserved and should not be used. One
of these reserved port numbers is port 0. It is reserved in most common transport
layer protocols, i.e., TCP [37], UDP [37], UDP-Lite [27], and SCTP [39]. When
providing a port number 0 to the bind() system call to establish a connection,
operating systems generally choose a free port from the dynamic range [28,33].
Therefore, one needs to create a raw socket in order to send port 0 packets.
However, previous work has shown that there is a non-negligible share of traﬃc
using port number 0 both in darknets and the Internet [9,29,30].
In this work, we shed light on port 0 traﬃc in the Internet, by analyzing
the traﬃc from real networks, rather than darknets as is done in most related
work, and by performing active measurements to survey the real-world reaction
of hosts and routers to port 0 traﬃc.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work which conducts both
active and passive measurements on port 0 in the Internet, to better understand
port 0 traﬃc characteristics and origins. Speciﬁcally, this work has the following
three main contributions:
– We leverage a ﬂow-level dataset from a large European IXP to inspect the
origins of port 0 traﬃc (cf. Sect. 4). We ﬁnd that out of the top 10 ASes
originating port 0 traﬃc, the majority does not follow typical diurnal patterns
of common protocols such as TCP/80.
– We inspect four packet-level datasets to discover the actual contents and
detailed characteristics of port 0 packets (cf. Sect. 5). We show that the
majority of non-empty packets in UDP are related to BitTorrent. We ﬁnd
that most TCP packets do not contain any payload and are one-way. However,
most of the two-way TCP streams are scanning artifacts.
– We perform active measurements both in IPv4 and IPv6 to gain a tangible
perspective over port 0 responsive IP addresses (cf. Sect. 6). We ﬁnd that
IPv4 traﬃc using TCP uncovers a substantial number of responsive hosts in a
small number of ASes. We also perform traceroute-style active measurements
to better understand port 0 traﬃc ﬁltering in wild, and ﬁnd discrepancies
between IPv4 and IPv6. Finally, we will run periodic port 0 measurements
and make the results available to the research community.
2 Related Work
Already in 1983, Reynolds and Postel speciﬁed that port number 0 is reserved
in TCP and UDP [37]. Over the course of several years, similar provisions have
been introduced for other transport protocols as well [27,39]. Traﬃc sent from
or to port 0 thus violates these speciﬁcations. Fittingly, most reports on port 0
traﬃc are associated with DDoS attacks [25,31,41] and malformed packets [10].
Even though there is traﬃc on port 0 in the Internet, there is little research
on its root causes. Motivated by port 0 traﬃc spikes observed in November 2013
at the Internet Storm Center and reports from security researchers at Cisco
Systems, Bou-Harb et al. [9] study port 0 traﬃc on 30 GB of darknet data.
They ﬁlter out any misconﬁgured traﬃc and packets with non-conforming TCP
ﬂags common in backscatter traﬃc [43]. Using ﬁngerprinting techniques [8], they
argued that more than 97% of their identiﬁed port 0 traﬃc was related to probing
activities, some orchestrated by malware.
In 2019, Luchs and Doerr [29] revisit the case of port 0 traﬃc, by studying
data obtained from a /15 darknet over a period of three years. They ﬁnd that
out of about 33,000 source IP addresses involved in port 0 traﬃc, 10% can be
attributed to DDoS attacks, 6% to OS ﬁngerprinting, and less than 1% to scan-
ning activities. When aggregating by the number of packets instead, scanning
traﬃc dominates with 48% of all port 0 packets.
More recently, Maghsoudlou et al. [30] analyze port 0 traﬃc for a single
passive measurement source. Similarly to our results, they ﬁnd that a small
number of ASes are responsible for about half of all port 0 traﬃc.

In contrast to the related work [9,29,30], which all focus their eﬀorts on
the analysis of a single passive data source, in this paper we analyze four com-
plementing passive datasets in addition to conducting an active measurement
campaign to better understand port 0 traﬃc in the wild.
3 Datasets Overview
We leverage two diﬀerent kinds of passive datasets to study port 0 traﬃc charac-
teristics: Flow-level and packet-level data. Throughout the paper, port 0 traﬃc
refers to the subset of the traﬃc which has either source port or destination port
or both set to zero. Flow-level data gives us a high-level overview of Internet traf-
ﬁc and can be used to analyze the aggregate ﬂow of traﬃc. In our case, we use
one week of IPFIX ﬂow data from a large European IXP. On the other hand, to
be able to dissect detailed traﬃc characteristics like fragmentation, header ﬂags,
and diﬀerent payloads, we need to inspect every single packet. Therefore, we use
four diﬀerent packet-level datasets, namely long-term and short-term MAWI,
CAIDA, and Waikato. Diﬀerent packet-level datasets are used to cover diﬀerent
geographical and temporal vantage points.
As shown in Table 1, we use the following datasets:
IXP One week of sampled IPFIX data from the end of January 2020 captured
at a large European IXP.
MAWI These datasets [32] contain packet traces from the transit link of the
WIDE backbone [42] to the upstream ISP captured at samplepoint-F. They
include partial packet payload. To obtain a more comprehensive view, we use
two variants of MAWI datasets:
– MAWI-long This dataset captures 15-minute snapshots each month
from January 2007 to July 2020.
– MAWI-short We also use the most recent MAWI dataset being part of
the Day in the Life of the Internet project [12], which is April 8–9, 2020.
CAIDA This dataset [11] contains anonymized packet traces without payload
from CAIDA’s passive monitors. For our analysis we use the most recent
dataset available at the time of writing, which is the one-hour period from
14:00–15:00 UTC recorded on January 17, 2019.
Waikato This dataset [40] contains packet header traces including the ﬁrst few
bytes of payload and is captured at the border of the University of Waikato
network in New Zealand.
We analyze port 0 traﬃc seen in passive data in detail in Sect. 4 and 5. In
addition to passive ﬂow and packet data, we also conduct active measurements.
More speciﬁcally, we run two types of measurements to analyze responsiveness
on port 0 and ﬁltering of port 0 traﬃc in the Internet:
Port scan. We use ZMap [16,46] and ZMapv6 [47] to ﬁnd responsive addresses on
port 0. In IPv4 we conduct Internet-wide measurements, in IPv6 we leverage
an IPv6 hitlist [19–21].

Traceroute. We use Yarrp [7,45] to traceroute addresses in IPv4 and IPv6
preﬁxes in order to analyze port 0 traﬃc ﬁltering in the Internet.
We present results from our active measurement campaign in Sect. 6. By
leveraging both passive and active measurements we can analyze diﬀerent aspects
of port 0 traﬃc in the wild.
3.1 Ethical Considerations
Before conducting active measurements, we follow an internal multi-party
approval process which incorporates proposals by Partridge and Allman [36]
and Dittrich et al. [15]. We follow scanning best practices [16] by limiting our
probing rate, maintaining a blocklist, and using dedicated servers with informing
