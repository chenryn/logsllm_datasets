User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题cannot list directory when accessing ftp server remotely i installed vsftpd and everything is working fine when accessing it locally, but i cannot view the folders when accessing it remotely.

using filezilla in my remote PC, i get this:

status: connecting to 192.x.x.x
status: connection established, waiting for welcome message
response: welcome 
command: user admin
response: specify pass
command: pass ****
response: 230 login successful
command: opts utf8 on
response: 200 always in utf8 mode
status: connected
status: retrieving directory listing..
command: pwd
response: 257 "/var/ftp"
command: type I
response: 200 switching to binary mode
command: PASV
response: 227 entering passive mode (192.168.8.5,59,0).
command: list


and it stops right there, then connection timeout, i cannot view the folders or the directories on the ftp server.

On my iptables -L -n

ACCEPT     tcp  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0           tcp dpt:21  
ACCEPT     tcp  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0           tcp dpt:20

Assistant: The problem is very likely that you've asked for passive mode - where the client is required to open a new data connection to the server, on the specified port - but you haven't permitted those ports through your firewall.  For example, the data connection above is expected on port TCP/15104 (59*256+0), but you've only allowed inbound TCP/21 and TCP/20 (or, at least, that's all you've told us about).

We can't know this for sure until we see the whole firewall ruleset; could you amend the question to include the entire output of iptables -L -n -v?
