Subject: Request to Add `exclude_from_weight_decay` Parameter to AdamW

I hope this message finds you well.

I would like to request the addition of an `exclude_from_weight_decay` parameter to the AdamW optimizer. This feature is essential for excluding specific parameters from weight decay, which can improve model performance in certain scenarios.
