I tried to implement React Helmet for our project and noticed a bug when
running in production mode.  
React Helmet doesn't initialize on the very first request after starting the
application. But it initializes correctly on each subsequent request (SSR &
CSR).  
I cloned the minimal with-react-helmet example and I can confirm that the
issue appears there, too.

  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
React Helmet should initialize correctly on the first request that was made.
## Current Behavior
As described above, React Helmet doesn't initialize correctly on the very
first request.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Clone with-react-helmet
  2. npm install
  3. npm run build
  4. npm start
  5. Check the DOM/page source
