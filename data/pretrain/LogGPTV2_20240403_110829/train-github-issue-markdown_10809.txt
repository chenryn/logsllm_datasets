 **Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**

**What is the current behavior?**  
When a child throws an error inside an error boundary and hits it's
`componentDidCatch` the error is still logged to the console regardless of any
handling that you then do inside of your `componentDidCatch`.
**What is the expected behavior?**  
Wouldn't it make more sense to give some more fine grated control over how
errors get logged once they do bubble up all the way to an error boundary? My
motivation for this is:
  * When using an error logging service (rollbar, sentry, etc.) you normally don't really need/want your error to bubble through to the console in production.
  * Testing an error boundary component feels a bit funky right now because for test runners like jest you have to mock jsDom's virtual console to suppress error showing up in your test results.
  * The severity of an error caught by a specific error boundary might be just a warning, thus you would have to throw a console.warn along the already thrown error.
  * When you try/catch outside of react you would also handle the logging in your catch by rethrowing a specific exception.
I wonder what your opinion is on this :)
