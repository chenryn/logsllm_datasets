# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
Use windows search's results to improve localization performance.
The windows search is doing well at localization. For example in the following
scenario:  
I use the chinese version windows. When i want to open the “计算器” (Calculator
in English) app, i can get it in 3 ways use win + s:
  1. Search "calc". Win+s works, PT Run fail.
  2. Search "计算器". Both win+s & PT Run works.
  3. Search "jisuanqi". The word "jisuanqi" is the Pinyin of "计算器". Win+s works well, PT Run can not recognize this.
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
If PT Run can use the best result of windows search, it will fix many
localization issues.
Use windows search results or implement this function in PT Run's way.
