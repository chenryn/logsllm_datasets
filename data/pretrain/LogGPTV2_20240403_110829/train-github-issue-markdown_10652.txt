# Summary of the New Feature/Enhancement
The proposed enhancement aims to improve the localization performance of PowerToys Run (PT Run) by leveraging the results from Windows Search. Windows Search is already proficient at localizing search queries, as demonstrated in the following scenario:

- **Scenario:**
  - **Operating System:** Chinese version of Windows.
  - **Objective:** Open the "计算器" (Calculator) app.
  - **Methods:**
    1. **Search Term: "calc"**
       - **Windows Search (Win + S):** Successful.
       - **PowerToys Run (PT Run):** Fails.
    2. **Search Term: "计算器"**
       - **Windows Search (Win + S):** Successful.
       - **PowerToys Run (PT Run):** Successful.
    3. **Search Term: "jisuanqi" (Pinyin for "计算器")**
       - **Windows Search (Win + S):** Successful.
       - **PowerToys Run (PT Run):** Fails.

# Proposed Technical Implementation Details
To address these localization issues, the following technical implementation is proposed:

- **Integration with Windows Search Results:**
  - PT Run should be enhanced to utilize the best result from Windows Search. This will ensure that PT Run can recognize and handle localized search terms more effectively, thereby improving the user experience.
  - **Implementation Options:**
    - **Option 1:** Directly integrate and use the results from Windows Search.
    - **Option 2:** Implement a similar functionality within PT Run to achieve the same level of localization accuracy as Windows Search.

By implementing this feature, PT Run will be able to handle a wider range of localized search terms, providing a more seamless and efficient experience for users.
