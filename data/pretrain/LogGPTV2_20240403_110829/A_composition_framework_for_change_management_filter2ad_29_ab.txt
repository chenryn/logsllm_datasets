#### Alignment to Other Frameworks
**3.1 Related Frameworks**
The CA-OCM aligns with the CA-PMF and other frameworks that support the project implementation effort. CA-OCM activities span the PMLC and are grouped within PMLC process phases. It is important to recognize the integration points among different frameworks and their associated lifecycles.

**OCM Lifecycle**:
- The OCM lifecycle refers to a series of activities addressing the people-side of a change initiative, spanning the entire PMLC.
- The design accommodates projects of varying size, complexity, and type, and all project OCM efforts can be aligned to the PMLC structure.
- In addition to the PMLC, the OCM Lifecycle also aligns with:
  - Business Process Reengineering (BPR) Lifecycle
  - Project Approval Lifecycle (PAL)
  - System Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

**Integration**:
- During project implementation, the OCM Lifecycle, PMLC, BPR Lifecycle, and SDLC often occur in parallel.
- Figure 3-1 depicts the OCM Lifecycle in association with these lifecycles.
- Successful management of each lifecycle can greatly affect the others and contribute to the overall project success.
- California has adopted the Project Approval Lifecycle (PAL) to improve the quality, value, and likelihood of success of technology projects undertaken by the State of California.

#### OCM Knowledge Areas
The CA-OCM is comprised of six knowledge areas. A knowledge area groups a set of OCM activities that share a common purpose and objective and can span multiple PMLC process phases. This section describes the six OCM knowledge areas, including their purpose, objectives, and timing within the PMLC.

**4.1 Purpose of Knowledge Areas**
- The purpose of the OCM knowledge areas is to group the concepts the OCM Practitioner needs to understand and the associated activities they will need to perform.
- Knowledge areas and their associated activities often have interdependencies and interrelationships with other OCM knowledge areas.
- The six knowledge areas of the CA-OCM are:
  - OCM Lifecycle Management
  - Communication
  - Leadership Support
  - Team Dynamics
  - Stakeholder Enrollment
  - Training

**Guidance**:
- The CA-OCM provides guidance on when specific knowledge area activities should occur during a project.
- The CA-OCM presents the knowledge areas in the general order in which they begin within the PMLC; however, each OCM Practitioner will need to determine applicability and timing, and align OCM activities to the specific needs of a project.
- Guidance on tailoring OCM efforts to specific projects and project needs is provided throughout the CA-OCM.

#### 4.2 OCM Knowledge Areas
Knowledge areas span multiple process phases and occur at different times during the PMLC. Figure 4-1 identifies the OCM knowledge area goal within each process phase where there are associated activities. Additionally, a single, overarching goal is presented for each knowledge area.

**OCM Lifecycle Management**:
- Focuses on managing the performance of the OCM effort through planning and scheduling of OCM activities.
- Guides the direction and governs the sequence and resourcing of all other knowledge area activities.
- Requires continuous coordination with the Project Manager to ensure the OCM effort is integrated with other project activities and milestones.

**Communication**:
- Focuses on ensuring a common understanding of the change effort through communication and feedback activities.
- Works to inform and engage those involved with and affected by the change initiative.
- Vital component of the OCM effort as it creates awareness and understanding of the change to obtain stakeholder buy-in and reduce employee resistance.

**Leadership Support**:
- Focuses on ensuring that leadership at all levels demonstrates visible support for the change.
- Activities guide the effort to engage and support all leaders influential to or impacted by the change, from the Project Sponsor to managers and supervisors.
- Leaders provide visible change support and serve as role models to other stakeholders.

**Team Dynamics**:
- Focuses on creating and maintaining high-performing teams.
- Activities are tailored around team and individual expectations and guidelines and are designed to create a positive and collaborative working environment.
- May focus on the project team and sub-teams, or any other collaborative group.

**Stakeholder Enrollment**:
- Focuses on ensuring stakeholder buy-in.
- Stakeholders include persons or groups directly or indirectly affected by a project, as well as those who may influence its outcome.
- Builds on the stakeholder identification, analysis, and management activities prescribed by the CA-PMF.
- Efforts in this knowledge area serve to connect with stakeholders at all levels to ensure they are informed and accepting of the change initiative.

**Training**:
- Focuses on ensuring end users have the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) they need to transition and be successful in a new environment.
- Activities plan for, build, and implement a training program that allows end users to be better prepared to adopt the new system.

### Templates | Page 2

**California Department of Technology: Organizational Change Management Framework**

**Approach**
Organizational Change Management (OCM) is a discipline that follows a consistent series of activities. The CA-OCM provides standardized templates to accompany key activities. These templates are a core component of the CA-OCM and will help the OCM Practitioner document activities and provide clear, meaningful results. In some cases, the CA-OCM refers to these templates as “tools.” A template, just like any other tool, helps get the job done.

**1.1 Advantages of Using Templates**
- Pre-developed templates offer the OCM Practitioner a standardized method for the collection, analysis, and documentation of OCM-related content required throughout the CA-OCM.
- Standardization reduces the time to complete OCM activities, increases transparency into OCM activities, reduces risk, and improves outcomes.
- Some organizations may already possess well-developed OCM templates; however, the OCM Practitioner may still benefit by supplementing existing templates with those that are part of the CA-OCM.

**1.2 Template Sources Referenced in the CA-OCM**
- The CA-OCM references and links to a variety of supporting templates designed for a specific purpose and with the objective of guiding the OCM Practitioner through implementing OCM activities. There are two main sources of templates referenced in the CA-OCM.

**1.2.1 CA-OCM Templates**
- Designed to enable project teams to manage the change associated with project implementations and/or Business Process Reengineering (BPR) projects successfully, consistently, and efficiently.
- Specific to OCM activities and will help the team plan, assess, and implement organizational change.
- Support OCM activities through all process phases.

**1.2.2 CA-PMF Templates**
- The California Project Management Framework (CA-PMF) templates are designed to help Project Managers keep the project on schedule, on budget, and on time.
- Provide Project Managers with the resources to manage all aspects of a project, including requirements, risk, schedule, scope, deliverables, cost, communication, and changes.
- Leveraged to support OCM activities where there are outputs that are the same or similar in content.
- Available at: [CA-PMF Templates](http://capmf.cio.ca.gov/Templates.html).

**1.3 CA-OCM Template Types**
- CA-OCM templates have been developed to accommodate differences in the experience of the OCM Practitioner.
- Two formats or types: templates with instructions for those requiring more guidance and template shells for those with more experience.

**1.3.1 Templates with Instructions**
- Contain a significant amount of instruction describing how to complete the template.
- Intended for less experienced OCM Practitioners.
- Instructions serve as a guide and can be deleted as the template is completed.
- Many templates with instructions also contain examples and sample text that may be helpful and can be deleted or modified to suit the needs of the project.

**1.3.2 Templates Shells**
- Contain the same template structure and content headings as the templates with instructions but do not include significant amounts of instructional text or examples.
- Intended to assist more experienced OCM Practitioners who are already familiar with similar tools and prefer to use a shell template, and/or those who have previously worked with the template with instructions and prefer to now start with a template shell.

**i Web Links**
- Leverage the CA-PMF templates where applicable: [CA-PMF Templates](http://capmf.cio.ca.gov/Templates.html).

**1.4 Templates by Knowledge Area and Process Phase**
- Some of the templates used during the CA-OCM are used throughout multiple process phases.
- The table below lists each of the templates by knowledge area and identifies which process phases it is being used in.

**To access the templates in a fillable format, see the CA-OCM website at the following link: [CA-OCM Templates](http://projectresources.cio.ca.gov/ocm) or expand the templates tab.
