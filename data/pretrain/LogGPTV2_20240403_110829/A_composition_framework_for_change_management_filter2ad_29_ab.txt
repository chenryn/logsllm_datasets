2.4  Call-Out Boxes
Throughout  the  CA-OCM,  “call-out”  boxes  are  used  to  bring  attention  to 
information  that  further  supports  the  narrative.  These  graphics  have  been 
incorporated  into  the  document  to  highlight  useful  information  at  a  glance. 
Examples of call-out boxes may include:
•  Navigation elements: recommended practices to consider, inputs to 
review, roles involved, guidelines to follow, activities to undertake,  
tools available for assistance, and outputs to create
•  Skills that are useful for a particular activity
•  Website links or other references for more information
•  Quotes and that are highlighted for greater emphasis

Alignment to Other Frameworks
3.1  Related Frameworks
The  CA-OCM  aligns  with  the  CA-PMF  and  other  frameworks  that  support  the 
project implementation effort. CA-OCM activities span the PMLC and are grouped 
within PMLC process phases. It is important to recognize the integration points 
among the different frameworks and their associated lifecycles.
The OCM lifecycle refers to a series of activities that are conducted to address 
the people-side of a change initiative. This effort spans throughout the entire 
PMLC.  The  design  accommodates  projects  that  vary  in  size,  complexity,  and 
type, and all project OCM efforts can be aligned to the PMLC structure.
In addition to the PMLC, the OCM Lifecycle also aligns with:
•  Business Process Reengineering (BPR) Lifecycle
•  Project Approval Lifecycle (PAL)
•  System Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
During  project  implementation,  the  OCM  Lifecycle,  PMLC,  BPR  Lifecycle,  and 
SDLC may support one another and often occur in parallel. Figure 3-1 depicts the 
OCM Lifecycle in association with these lifecycles. The successful management 
of each lifecycle can greatly affect the others and contribute to the success of the 
overall project. In addition to these lifecycles, California has adopted the Project 
Approval Lifecycle (PAL) to improve the quality, value, and likelihood of success of 
technology projects undertaken by the State of California.

OCM Knowledge Areas
The  CA-OCM  is  comprised  of  six  knowledge  areas.  A  knowledge  area  groups 
a set of OCM activities that share a common purpose and objective and can 
span across multiple PMLC process phases. This section describes the six OCM 
knowledge areas including the purpose, objectives, and timing within the PMLC.
4.1  Purpose of  
Knowledge Areas
The purpose of the OCM knowledge areas is to group the concepts the OCM 
Practitioner needs to understand and the associated activities he/she will need 
to perform. It is important to note that knowledge areas and their associated 
activities often have interdependencies and interrelationships with other OCM 
knowledge areas. The six knowledge areas of the CA-OCM are:
•  OCM Lifecycle Management
•  Communication
•  Leadership Support
•  Team Dynamics
•  Stakeholder Enrollment
•  Training
The  CA-OCM  provides  guidance  on  when  specific  knowledge  area  activities 
should occur during a project. The CA-OCM presents the knowledge areas in 
the  general  order  in  which  they  begin  within  the  PMLC;  however,  each  OCM 
Practitioner  will  need  to  determine  applicability  and  timing,  and  align  OCM 
activities to the specific needs of a project. Guidance on tailoring OCM efforts to 
specific projects and project needs is provided throughout the CA-OCM.

4.2  OCM Knowledge Areas
Knowledge  areas  span  multiple  process  phases  and  occur  at  different  times 
during  the  PMLC.  Figure  4-1  identifies  the  OCM  knowledge  area  goal  within 
each process phase where there are associated activities. Additionally, a single, 
overarching goal is presented for each knowledge area.

Overview
California Department of Technology
Organizational Change Management Framework
The following provides a brief description of the six OCM knowledge areas:
OCM Lifecycle Management
OCM Lifecycle Management focuses on managing the performance of the OCM 
effort through the planning and scheduling of OCM activities. These activities 
guide  the  direction  and  govern  the  sequence  and  resourcing  of  all  other 
knowledge  area  activities.  OCM  Lifecycle  Management  requires  continuous 
coordination with the Project Manager to ensure the OCM effort is integrated 
with other project activities and milestones.
Communication
Communication  focuses  on  ensuring  a  common  understanding  of  the 
change  effort  through  communication  and  feedback  activities.  It  works  to 
inform and engage those involved with and affected by the change initiative. 
Communication is a vital component of the OCM effort as it creates awareness 
and  understanding  of  the  change  to  obtain  Stakeholder  buy-in  and  reduce 
employee resistance.
Leadership Support
Leadership  Support  focuses  on  ensuring  that 
levels 
demonstrates  visible  support  for  the  change.  Leadership  Support  activities 
guide the effort to engage and support all leaders influential to or impacted 
by the change, from the Project Sponsor to managers and supervisors. These 
leaders,  in  turn,  provide  visible  change  support  and  serve  as  role  models  to 
other Stakeholders.
leadership  at  all 
Team Dynamics
Team Dynamics focuses on creating and maintaining high performing teams. 
Team Dynamics activities are tailored around team and individual expectations 
and guidelines and are designed to create a positive and collaborative working 
environment. Team Dynamics may focus on the project team and sub teams, or 
any other collaborative group.

Organizational Change Management Framework
Stakeholder Enrollment
Stakeholder Enrollment focuses on ensuring Stakeholder buy-in. Stakeholders 
include persons or groups who are directly or indirectly affected by a project, 
as well as those who may have the ability to influence its outcome. Stakeholder 
Enrollment builds on the Stakeholder identification, analysis, and management 
activities  that  are  prescribed  by  the  CA-PMF.  Efforts  in  this  knowledge  area 
serve to connect with Stakeholders at all levels to ensure they are informed and 
accepting of the change initiative.
Training
Training focuses on ensuring end users have the necessary knowledge, skills, and 
abilities (KSAs) they need to transition and be successful in a new environment. 
Activities in this knowledge area plan for, build, and implement a training program 
that allows end users to be better prepared to adopt the new system.

Organizational Change Management Framework
Approach
Organizational Change Management (OCM) is a discipline that follows a consistent 
series of activities. The CA-OCM provides standardized templates to accompany 
key activities. These templates are a core component of the CA-OCM and will help 
the OCM Practitioner document activities and provide clear, meaningful results. 
In some cases, the CA-OCM refers to these templates as “tools.” A template, just 
like any other tool, helps get the job done.
1.1  Advantages of  
Using Templates
Pre-developed  templates  offer  the  OCM  Practitioner  a  standardized  method  for 
the  collection,  analysis,  and  documentation  of  OCM-related  content  required 
throughout the CA-OCM. This standardization reduces the time to complete OCM 
activities,  increases  transparency  into  OCM  activities,  reduces  risk,  and  improve 
outcomes.  Some  organizations  may  already  possess  well-developed  OCM 
templates;  however,  the  OCM  Practitioner  may  still  benefit  by  supplementing 
templates that exist within the organization with those that are part of the CA-OCM. 
1.2  Template Sources 
Referenced in the CA-OCM
The CA-OCM references and links to a variety of supporting templates designed for 
a specific purpose and with the objective of guiding the OCM Practitioner through 
implementing OCM activities. There are two main sources of templates referenced 
in the CA-OCM.
1.2.1 CA-OCM Templates
The CA-OCM templates are designed to enable project teams to manage the 
change  associated  with  project  implementations  and/or  Business  Process 
Templates | Page 3
Templates

Organizational Change Management Framework
Reengineering (BPR) projects successfully, consistently, and efficiently. These 
templates are specific to OCM activities and will help the team plan, assess, 
and  implement  organizational  change.  The  CA-OCM  templates  support  OCM 
activities through all process phases.
1.2.2 CA-PMF Templates
The  California  Project  Management  Framework  (CA-PMF)  templates  are 
designed  to  help  Project  Managers  keep  the  project  on  schedule,  on 
budget,  and  on  time.  CA-PMF  templates  provide  Project  Managers  with  the 
resources  to  manage  all  aspects  of  a  project,  including  requirements,  risk, 
schedule,  scope,  deliverables,  cost,  communication,  and  changes.  CA-PMF 
templates  are  leveraged  to  support  OCM  activities  where  there  are  outputs 
that  are  the  same  or  similar  in  content.  CA-PMF  templates  are  available  at: 
http://capmf.cio.ca.gov/Templates.html.
1.3  CA-OCM Template Types
CA-OCM  templates  have  been  developed  to  accommodate  differences  in  the 
experience  of  the  OCM  Practitioner.  As  a  result,  the  CA-OCM  templates  have 
been designed in two formats or types: templates with instructions for those 
that require more guidance and template shells for those with more experience.
1.3.1 Templates with Instructions
Templates  with  instructions  contain  a  significant  amount  of  instruction 
describing how to complete the template. These templates are intended for the 
less experienced OCM Practitioner. The instructions serve as a guide and can be 
deleted as the template is completed. Many templates with instructions also 
contain examples and sample text that may be helpful. This text may also be 
deleted or modified to suit the needs of the project as the template is completed.
1.3.2 Templates Shells
Template  shells  contain  the  same  template  structure  and  content  headings 
as  the  templates  with  instructions;  however,  they  do  not  include  significant 
amounts  of  instructional  text  or  examples.  Template  shells  are  intended  to 
assist  the  more  experienced  OCM  Practitioner  who  is  already  familiar  with 
similar  tools  and  prefers  to  use  a  shell  template,  and/or  those  that  have 
previously worked with the template with instructions and prefer to now start 
with a template shell.
