  * Electron version: 0.36.9
  * Operating system: OS X 10.0.2
The error showed on startup, and kept showing up for several times after
clicking on OK. But when I opened my app the other time, the dialog did not
reproduce. I think this might the with the electron itself.
    Uncaught Exception:
    TypeError: Cannot read property 'delete' of undefined
