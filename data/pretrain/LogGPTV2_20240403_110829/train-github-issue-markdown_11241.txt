When a ngModel is attached to a HTML5 color input the resulting variable seems
to lag one check behind. meaning if you listen for the input to be changed and
then log the value the first ngDoCheck or ngAfterContentChecked returns the
previous value of the color not the current value.  
A example of this is this code
    (function(app){
        app.testing=ng.core.Component({
            selector:"testing",
            template:""
        }).Class({
            constructor:[function(){
                this.value="#ffffff";
                this.changed=false;
                this.changeupd=function(){
                    this.changed=true;
                };
            }],
            ngAfterContentChecked:function(){
                if(this.changed){
                    console.log(this.value);
                    this.changed=false;
                }
            },
        });
    })(window.app||(window.app={}));
the result of this code is `#ffffff` for the first console.log and then
whatever the previous color was for all subsequent changes
this creates a problem for any programs that run specific functions only after
specific inputs are changed. i have not seen that problem with any other type
of input except the html5 color
