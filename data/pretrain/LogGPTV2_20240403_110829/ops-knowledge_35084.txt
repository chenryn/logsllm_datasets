User: I have tried to open ipython notebook without luck and don't know why?
When i type the command "ipython notebook", the output i receive is :
-bash: /usr/local/bin/ipython: /usr/local/opt/python/bin/python2.7: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
Any help ?
Assistant: I just got the same problem when I upgrade my python2.7 to python3 by using homebrew yesterday. Tried googled suggestions but no one really solved the problem. Then I checked the first line of my pip, pip3, ipython, ipython2, ipython3 and jupyter. Found the problem actually is that the first lines of jupyter and ipython2 still point to the old python2.7 path "/usr/local/opt/python/bin/python2.7" which is not exist anymore. So, I just changed the first line to "#!/usr/local/opt/python/bin/python3.6" for jupyter and the problem solved.
