In one application I am having a second twig environment where I only use a
different loader, to be precise a string loader for some advance rendering. In
the second environment I want to be able to leverage the same options to have
access to the same settings as in the main environment.
Therefore I had this service definition:
        app.core.twig_string_loader:
            class:        "Twig_Loader_String"
        app.core.twig_string:
            class:        "%twig.class%"
            arguments:    [@app.core.twig_string_loader, %twig.options%]
Actually it seems that many were using this parameter in their application. A
GitHub search shows 3.855 occurences for the term "%twig.options%".
I understand as per #13476 that there is no BC promise on parameters, however
as it looks like there were many using that parameter at least we should state
a recommended upgrade path in the upgrade documentation.
