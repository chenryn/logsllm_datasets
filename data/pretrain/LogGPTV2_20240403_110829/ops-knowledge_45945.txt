**Development History of IT Shared Service Centers**

The IT shared service center (IT SSC) is an innovative approach to standardize and simplify IT service management within an organization. By consolidating IT-related personnel, technologies, resources, and processes, the IT SSC provides unified, professional, standardized, and efficient services to internal customers. This centralization aims to integrate resources, improve service quality, reduce costs, and enhance overall efficiency.

### Early Stages: Pioneering Efforts

- **1980s: Emergence of the Concept**
  - **Ford Motor Company**: The first company to implement the concept of a shared service center, Ford established a financial shared service center in Europe in the early 1980s. This initiative set a precedent for the construction of shared service centers.
  - **DuPont and General Electric (GE)**: During the same period, DuPont and GE also created shared service agencies with similar functions, further validating the concept.

### Expansion and Adoption: 1990s

- **Multinational Corporations**: In the 1990s, multinational companies such as Hewlett-Packard, Dell, and IBM followed the lead of Ford, DuPont, and GE by establishing their own shared service centers. This period saw a significant deepening of the concept and practice of shared services.

### Global Spread: 21st Century

- **China and Other Markets**: In the 21st century, the concept of shared service centers rapidly gained traction in China. Companies like Haier, ENN, and China Netcom were among the first to adopt and implement this model, setting up their own shared service centers. This trend expanded globally, with shared services evolving from isolated implementations to a widespread organizational strategy.

### Digital Age: Continuous Evolution

- **Current Trends**: In the digital age, the concept of the IT shared service center continues to evolve and improve. Today, the IT SSC is a crucial component of organizational strategy, providing value-oriented services that create substantial benefits for the organization. These services not only streamline operations but also drive innovation and support strategic business objectives.
