Update #4213 introduced support for addressing instances by their names in Route53. However, Ansible is not picking up the `host_vars` file with the same name as expected. 

To clarify:
- Update #4213: Added the capability to reference instances by their names in Route53.
- Issue: The `host_vars` file, which should be recognized based on the instance name, is not being utilized by Ansible.

Please ensure that the `host_vars` file is correctly named and placed in the appropriate directory, and that the instance names in Route53 match the filenames.
