### Description

In the framework bundle, cache pools can be easily configured as follows:

```yaml
framework:
    cache:
        pools:
            cache.pool1:
                adapter: cache.adapter.redis
            cache.pool2:
                adapter: cache.adapter.redis
```

However, all the cache services created in this manner only implement the PSR-6 `Psr\Cache\CacheItemPoolInterface`. We would prefer to use the PSR-16 `Psr\SimpleCache\CacheInterface` instead.

Currently, the only solution appears to be wrapping each pool in an adapter, such as:

```yaml
services:
    cache.simple.pool1:
        class: Symfony\Component\Cache\Simple\Psr6Cache
        arguments: ['@cache.pool1']
    cache.simple.pool2:
        class: Symfony\Component\Cache\Simple\Psr6Cache
        arguments: ['@cache.pool2']
```

This approach is quite cumbersome, especially when dealing with a large number of pools. It would be beneficial if the framework bundle provided a more straightforward way to use `SimpleCache` directly. For example, it would be ideal if the configuration could include an option to create PSR-16 caches, like this:

```yaml
framework:
    cache:
        pools:
            cache.pool1:
                adapter: cache.adapter.redis
                simple: true
            cache.pool2:
                adapter: cache.adapter.redis
                simple: true
```

This enhancement would significantly simplify the process and improve the overall user experience.
