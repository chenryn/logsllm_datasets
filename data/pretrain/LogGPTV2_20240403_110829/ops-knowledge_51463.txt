User: Please analyze the following code to find possible performance problems and optimize it. int sum(int n) {\n int result = 0;\n for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n result += i;\n }\n return result;\n}\ n\nint main() {\n int n = 100000;\n int result = sum(n);\n printf(\
Assistant: A possible performance problem in the code is that for very large values of n, the loop in the sum function is executed many times, resulting in a very long run time. In addition, using printf to output results is also relatively slow. The optimization method is as follows: 1. Use the mathematical formula to calculate the sum: n*(n+1)/2, which can avoid loop operations. 2. Replace printf with a faster output method, such as puts or directly output to a file. The modified code is as follows: int sum(int n) { return n * (n+1) / 2; } int main() { int n = 100000; int result = sum(n); puts(result); return 0 ; }
