LAESP messages and consequently the target’s calls are
not recorded in call-content wiretaps.
• A wiretap target enables call forwarding on her wireline or
mobile phone, redirecting calls to a high capacity call center
(e.g., an airline reservation system). Using an automated
tool (e.g., SIPp), she places many concurrent calls from
a subscribed Internet VoIP service to her phone, causing
all calls to be redirected and forcing the TSP to delegate
a separate CCC for every VoIP call. By placing 22 such
VoIP calls, she exhausts the capacity of the T1 connection
between the TSP and the LEA, enabling her to use her
wireline or mobile phone to place unmonitored calls.
The above attack scenarios are by no means exhaustive
of all possible wiretap countermeasures, and are intended
only to highlight the architectural weaknesses in current-
generation CALEA wiretap systems.
5. STOPGAP MITIGATION PRACTICES
In this section, we describe stopgap mitigations for several
of the described vulnerabilities. These recommendations
and best practices are intended to be used with currently
deployed CALEA equipment. However, because many vul-
nerabilities arise from the architectural design of J-standard-
based implementations and cannot therefore be remedied
without signiﬁcantly modifying the wiretap infrastructure,
the recommendations presented below are intended to miti-
gate some (but not all) of the described attacks and do not
necessarily result in a system that is impervious to manipu-
lation.
• Provision CDC and CCC resources according to
the subject’s signaling capabilities. The LEA and
TSP should ensure that bandwidth and other resources
are properly allocated for the CDC and CCC to prevent
exhaustion attacks. Rather than provision bandwidth ac-
cording to estimated average-case signaling rates, band-
width requirements should be derived from the subject’s
maximum possible signaling rate. Additionally, this same
worst-case analysis should be performed on internal links
connecting IAPs to the Delivery Function.
• Do not trust the interpretations of third-party sig-
naling. The wiretap system should not be trusted to accu-
rately estimate the interpretation of data by a third-party.
For example, the decoding of post cut-through DTMF tones
is subject to manipulation (see Section 3.6) and should not
be considered accurate.
• Disable in-band signaling features. In-band signaling
(e.g., the use of C-tones to convey hook status) allows the
subject to control the behavior of recording equipment. In-
band signaling should not be used between IAPs and the
DF (see Section 3.4) or between the TSP and the LEA (see
Section 3.6).
• Provision each wiretap with its own CDC. A CDC
should not carry call-identifying information from multiple
wiretap orders, preventing the manipulation of one wiretap
from causing denial-of-service to another.
• Clearly demarcate inbound and outbound messages
in a CCC. CCCs should always capture directionality. If
a combined CCC is used, the directionality bit for packet
data should be turned on.
• Reconcile pen register information with other forms
of evidence. LEAs should examine billing records and
other forms of evidence to reconcile pen register informa-
tion. Although such data may not be available in real-time,
the transmission of stored call records is not susceptible to
resource exhaustion attacks.
Although several of the vulnerabilities described in Sec-
tion 3 can be mitigated using the above stopgap procedures,
there are many design characteristics of CALEA systems
that make them inherently susceptible to manipulation. In
particular, combining data from multiple IAPs into a sin-
gle CDC, sending SMS and IP payloads via the CDC, and
requiring a separate CCC for each call leg are intrinsic in
CALEA designs based on the J-standard, leading to vul-
nerabilities that cannot easily be addressed by modifying
the conﬁgurations of wiretap systems. Additionally, while
521many of the resource exhaustion attacks identiﬁed could be
best mitigated by modifying TSP equipment, rarely do these
attacks on CALEA impact the operational stability of the
TSP. Without such danger there is little motivation for TSPs
to rate limit (potentially proﬁtable) calls or messages.
6. CONCLUSION
This paper represents the ﬁrst (in the public literature,
at least) security analysis of the J-standard, the architec-
ture currently used for the vast majority of law enforcement
wiretaps in the United States [2]. Our results demonstrate
that modern services, especially the wireless platforms that
account for most of the wiretaps, render these systems vul-
nerable to denial-of-service and other attacks. Unlike tra-
ditional eavesdropping countermeasures (e.g., encryption),
these attacks can be done unilaterally by a wiretap subject,
are diﬃcult to detect by law enforcement, and prevent the
accurate collection not only of content, but of the metadata
recorded in legal record.
Given that the J-standard appears to have been engi-
neered narrowly based on outdated assumptions about com-
munications platforms and has been “patched” several times
to accommodate a changing environment, the presence of
vulnerabilities in the architecture is somewhat unsurprising.
However, the scope and severity of the vulnerabilities em-
bedded in the standard is both surprising and disturbing.
It is especially dismaying that the CALEA standards – pro-
tocol speciﬁcations used for evidence gathering and inves-
tigative intelligence – fail to consider any attack model in
which a motivated target deliberately attempts to evade the
wiretap.
Instead, the standard notes (unwisely, as we have seen)
only that resources should be provisioned according to sta-
tistical traﬃc models [22] (for VoIP services) or that law en-
forcement has expressed preferences for 64kbps ISDN chan-
nels [3] (for wireline and wireless services). The asymme-
try of signaling resources between the target of the wiretap
and the channel over which wiretap information is conveyed
enables the target to overwhelm the wiretap at will. More-
over, because signaling information from multiple sources is
multiplexed over the same low-capacity link to law enforce-
ment, a target may use a high bandwidth service (e.g., his
mobile network’s data service) to saturate the wiretap in
order to place unmonitored calls using a lower bandwidth
service (e.g., a wireline telephone). Since multiple wiretaps
at a given switch may share the same channel to law en-
forcement, the resource consumption attack applies to all
wiretaps at the switch, not just those of the subject con-
ducting the attack.
In addition to overwhelming the capacity of the wiretap’s
signaling channel, we discovered attacks in which a target of
a content wiretap can inject spurious IP packets into wire-
tap transcripts, potentially causing the wiretap to interpret
messages of the target’s choosing rather than the messages
received by the other communication party. Another at-
tack, using call forwarding features, exhausts the wiretap’s
call content resources, allowing the target of a content wire-
tap to converse without being monitored. Finally, we note
that the use of in-band signaling within the telephone net-
work enables the target to suppress recording by producing
low amplitude dual frequency tones.
The vulnerabilities in the J-standard represent a serious
threat to the accuracy and completeness of wiretap records
used for both criminal investigation and as evidence at trial.
This has implications not only for investigators and prose-
cutors, but also for defendants, since exculpatory evidence
might also be missed.
