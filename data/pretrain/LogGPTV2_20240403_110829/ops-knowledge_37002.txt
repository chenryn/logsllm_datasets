User: When djutils goes through autodiscover in the init, it imports my task "app.commands.task1" and states this as part of the output of the log.
But when I run webserver and try to queue the command, the queue_consumer log indicates that it cannot find the key "project.app.commands.queuecmd_task1"

QueueException: project.app.commands.queuecmd_task1 not found in CommandRegistry

I assume that the fact that the string it is trying to find has "project" prepended is the reason it cannot find the task.
Why would that be happening?
Assistant: Looks like duplicate imports in my project were causing the problems.
