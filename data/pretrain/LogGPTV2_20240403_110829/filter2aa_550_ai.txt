threat that may already endanger the national security of governments around the 
world.218
Second, BCS 2010 was a truly international exercise. Because cyber attacks can be 
launched from anywhere in the world and are likely to traverse third-party coun-
tries en route to a target, it is critical to develop cross-border relationships before 
an international crisis occurs. In BCS 2010, over 100 personnel from seven coun-
tries participated. Numerous international partnerships were either established or 
strengthened during the course of this project.
Third, BCS 2010 conducted a post-exercise participant survey with a view toward 
providing a list of lessons learned to future CDXs around the world.219 Here are the 
highlights:
• There should be at least one WT member per BT and two WT members on 
the RT to allow for sufficient observation, communication, adjudication, and 
clarification on scoring.
• The WT should include a cyber-savvy lawyer to shed light on the legality of 
unscripted attack and defense scenarios.
• Each BT must have at least one full-time WT-appointed “dumb user” active on 
the virtual network to make client-side attacks possible.220 In BCS 2010, the

RT did not have the chance to use a powerful “zero-day” browser exploit with 
which they had intended to target the virtual power company employees.
• Prior to a “live-fire” CDX, all participants should devote one full day to testing 
connectivity, bandwidth, passwords, cryptographic keys, etc., and for clarifica-
tion on rules and scoring.
• The VMWare Server Console was too slow for the high demands BCS 2010 
placed upon it, and it cannot be recommended to other CDXs.
• The WT/GT should grant the BTs some network administration rights over 
their physical machines in the CDX environment. Otherwise, installing and 
patching software can be too time-consuming.
• A “wanton destruction” phase (i.e., one without a clearly defined purpose and 
certain limits on the RT) will likely destroy the game itself and so for most 
CDX scenarios cannot be recommended.
• In a project this big, some egos and agendas are bound to clash. It is important 
to designate diplomatic yet authoritative personalities, who can meet team-
oriented deadlines, from the beginning.
Finally, one of the lessons of BCS 2010 is that many of the challenges inherent in 
conducting a robust CDX mirror the challenges of managing both IT and cyber secu-
rity in the real world. Cyberspace is complicated, polymorphic, dynamic, and evolv-
ing quickly. Cyber defenders may never see the same attack twice. Furthermore, 
the intangible nature of cyberspace can make the calculation of victory, defeat, and 
battle damage a highly subjective undertaking. Therefore, believe it or not, both in 
the laboratory and in the real world, even knowing whether one is under cyber at-
tack can be a challenge.
Chapter 3 has introduced the reader to the highly technical nature of cyber security 
at the tactical level. Chapter 4 will show how cyber attacks have impacted the real 
world, even at the strategic level.

4. CYBER SECURITY: REAL-WORLD IMPACT
Chapter 3 described a wide range of technical challenges to securing the Inter-
net and revealed that even our national critical infrastructures are at risk. But it is 
always important to correlate theoretical discussion with real-world events. Have 
cyber attacks truly had an influence at the highest levels of government? To what 
extent have they impacted national security?
Cyber Security and Internal Political Security221
National security begins at home. No government can worry about foreign threats 
or adventures before it feels secure within its own borders.
In terms of domestic security, a major consideration for many governments is infor-
mation management, if not information control. The most famous example comes 
from fiction. In 1949, in his novel Nineteen Eighty-Four George Orwell imagined a 
government that waged full-time information warfare against its own citizens, with 
the aid of two-way Internet-like “telescreens.”222
Unfortunately, in 2011 some countries are not far from Orwell’s vision, and media 
carry only stories that are carefully crafted by government censors. For example, in 
North Korea, the world’s most repressive and isolated country, the perceived threat 
to stability from unrestricted access to the Internet is prohibitively high. Television 
and radio carry only government channels, and there is an Orwellian “national inter-
com” wired into residences and workplaces throughout the country through which 
the government provides information to its citizens.
North Korea’s aging leader, Kim Jong-il, is said to be fascinated with the IT revolu-
tion. In 2000, he gave visiting U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright his per-
sonal email address. However, computers are unavailable to ordinary North Korean 
citizens, and it is believed that only a small circle of North Korean leadership have 
free access to the Internet.
221 This chapter consists of an updated section from a 2007 paper, “Greetz from Room 101,” written and 
presented by the author at DEF CON 15 and Black Hat. It contains material from Reporters without 
Borders (www.rsf.org), OpenNet Initiative (www.opennet.net), Freedom House (www.freedomhouse.
org), Electronic Frontier Foundation (www.eff.org), ITU Digital Access Index (www.itu.int), and 
Central Intelligence Agency (www.cia.gov). For example, RSF assessments are based on a combination 
of “murders, imprisonment or harassment of cyber-dissidents or journalists, censorship of news sites, 
existence of independent news sites, existence of independent ISPs, and deliberately high connection 
charges.”
222 Orwell, 2003 (originally written in 1949).

BIRTH OF A CONCEPT: STRATEGIC CYBER SECURITY
Each year, one hundred male students as young as 8 years old are chosen to at-
tend the Kumsong computer school, where the curriculum consists of computer 
programming and English. The students are not allowed to play games or access the 
Internet, but they do have an instant messaging system within the school.
According to the South Korean Chief of Military Intelligence, some top graduates 
from the Kim Il-Sung Military Academy have been selected for an elite, state-spon-
sored hacker unit, where they develop “cyber-terror” operations.
International Internet connections run from North Korea to the rest of the world via 
Moscow and Beijing. They are managed at the Korea Computer Centre (KCC), estab-
lished in 1990. Reports suggest that KCC downloads officially-approved research 
and development data, which it offers to a very short list of clients.
North Korea’s official stance on Internet connectivity is that the government cannot 
tolerate the “spiritual pollution” of its country. However, South Korea determined 
that North Korea was operating a state-run cyber casino on a South Korean IP ad-
dress. Since that time, South Korean companies have been barred from registering 
North Korean sites without government approval.
According to recent statistics, North Korea is 48th in the world in population at 24.5 
million. However, the country possesses only three computers which are directly 
connected to the Internet, so it sits at number 227 in the world in that category.223
North Korea is not alone in fearing the power of the Internet to undermine its do-
mestic security. In Turkmenistan, President-for-Life Saparmurat Niyazov – the Turk-
menbashi, or Father of All – died in late 2006, but his personality cult and the 
tightly-controlled media he left behind have had a lasting impact on the country.
Information and communication technology is woefully underdeveloped. The Turk-
mentelekom monopoly has allowed almost no Internet access, either from home 
or via cyber café. A few Turkmen organizations have been allowed to access just a 
handful of officially-approved websites. In 2001, of all the countries of the former 
Soviet Union, Turkmenistan had the fewest number of IT-certified personnel – fifty-
eight.
In addition, the CIA reported in 2005 that there were only 36,000 Internet users, 
out of a population of 5 million. In 2006, a Turkmen journalist who had worked 
with Radio Free Europe died in prison, only three months after being jailed. Despite 
repeated European Union (EU) demands, there has been no investigation into the 
incident.

Cyber Security: Real-World Impact
Foreign embassies and non-governmental organizations furnish their own Internet 
access. In the past they have offered access to ordinary Turkmen, but it was too 
dangerous for the average citizen to accept the offer.
Following Niyazov’s death, Gurbanguli Berdymukhamedov was elected president224 
with a campaign promise to allow unrestricted access to the Internet. And within 
days, two cyber cafés opened in the capital. A visiting AP journalist reported easy 
access to international news sites, including those belonging to Turkmen political 
opposition groups. However, the price per hour was $4, exorbitant in a country 
where monthly income is under $100.
Today, Turkmenistan has a population of 5 million. Unfortunately, under 100,000, 
or under 2%, are believed to have Internet access.225 On the bright side, computer 
hardware is available in Turkmenistan, and computer gaming is popular. Also, the 
use of satellite TV is on the rise, which could be used to improve Internet connectiv-
ity in the future.
The world’s largest and most sophisticated Internet surveillance belongs to the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China (PRC), which employs an army of public and private226 cyber 
security personnel to keep watch over its citizens. The PRC has strict controls on 
access to the World Wide Web, and policemen are stationed at cyber cafés, which 
track patrons’ usage for 60 days.
The “Great Firewall” is designed specifically to prevent the free flow of information 
in and out of the country, including content related to politics, human rights, reli-
gion, and pornography. Some sites, such as Google and BBC, have been completely 
blocked for a period of time. Search results are believed to be filtered by keyword at 
the national gateway and not by web browsers in China.
The high level of sophistication in Chinese Internet surveillance is evident by the 
fact that some URLs have been blocked, even while corresponding top level domains 
(TLD) are accessible and webpage content appears consistent across the domain. 
This suggests active human participation in state censorship (i.e., the system is not 
completely automated). At the extreme end, some blog entries appear to have been 
edited by censors and reposted to the Web.
224 This election was not monitored by international observers.

226 Some Western companies have been accused of too much cooperation with China on cyber control 
issues: Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft have all collaborated in government prosecutions.

BIRTH OF A CONCEPT: STRATEGIC CYBER SECURITY
Comprehensive laws authorize government control of the media, while individual 
privacy statutes are unclear, in short supply, and perhaps even inapplicable in terms 
of information and communications technology (ICT).227
In 2007, Chinese President Hu Jintao called for a “purification” of the Internet, sug-
gesting that Beijing intended to tighten its control over computer networks even 
further. According to Hu, new technologies such as blogging and webcasting had 
allowed Chinese citizens to circumvent state controls, which had negatively affected 
the “development of socialist culture,” the “security of information,” and the “stabil-
ity of the state.”
Today, China is on the cutting edge of Internet technology research. In particular, 
it has invested heavily in Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), which could be used 
to support a long-term strategy of user control. PRC Internet Society chairwoman 
Hu Qiheng has stated that China’s goal is to achieve a state of “no anonymity” in 
cyberspace.
China’s fear of Internet freedom is shared by Cuba, whose highly educated popula-
tion lacks regular access to the web. Special authorization is required to buy com-
puter hardware, and Internet connection codes must be obtained from the govern-
ment. This has led to a healthy cyber black market; for example, students have been 
expelled from school for trading in connection codes. Some Cubans have connected 
to the Internet from the homes of expatriates, who have in turn been threatened by 
the police with expulsion from the country.
Cuban Decree-Law 209, written in 1996, states that “access from the Republic of 
Cuba to the Global Computer Network” may not violate “moral principles” or “jeop-
ardize national security.” Illegal network connections can earn a prison sentence 
of five years, posting a counter-revolutionary article, 20 years. At least two dozen 
journalists are now serving up to 27 years in prison.
As governments grow more familiar with censorship technology, they are capable 
of more complex decision-making. For example, at a 2006 Non-Aligned Movement 
summit in Havana, conference attendees had no problem connecting to the web. 
However, in the same year, when a human rights activist in the small village of Vi-
ñales tried to open an email from Reporters Without Borders containing the names 
227 However, in Asia, it is generally accepted that there is less privacy in one’s daily life, and the general 
populace is more comfortable with government oversight than in the West.

of Cuban dissidents, a pop-up window announced: “This programme will close down 
in a few seconds for state security reasons.”228
Recent statistics indicate that around 15% of Cuba’s population of 11 million is now 
online. However, there are only about 3,000 Internet-connected computers on the 
island, which is an extremely low number for 1.5 million users.229 Obviously, such a 
narrow funnel would make it easier for the government to monitor web communica-
tions.
Burma presents another extreme example of Internet paranoia. Out of a population 
of 50 million, only 78,000, or 0.6% of citizens, now use the web. The number of 
Internet-connected host computers in the country is just 42. A few cyber cafés exist, 
but they require name, identification number, address, and frequent screenshots of 
user activity to log in.  Thus, online privacy is non-existent.
In Burma, average citizens access not the Internet per se, but the “Myanmar Inter-
net,” which hosts only a small number of officially-sanctioned business websites. 
Furthermore, only state-sponsored email accounts are allowed; commercial web-
mail is prohibited.
One of the most common ways to deny Internet access is to make it prohibitively 
expensive. The Burmese average annual income is $225. A broadband connection 
is $1,300. Dial-up, the most common form of access, is $6 for 10 hours; outside the 
cities of Rangoon and Mandalay, long distance fees are also required. Entrance to a 
cyber café is $1.50.
According to the 1996 Computer Science Development Law, all network-ready com-
puters must be registered with the government. Failure to do so or sharing an In-
ternet connection with another person carries penalties of up to 15 years in prison.
Burma’s State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) prohibits “writings related 
to politics,” “incorrect ideas,” “criticism of a non-constructive type,” and anything 
“detrimental to the ideology of the state” or “detrimental to the current policies and 
secret security affairs of the government.” 
Some international groups, such as Free Burma Coalition and BurmaNet, have cam-
paigned for greater Internet freedom since 1996. But there is little resistance to 
Internet governance within Burma itself, due to its high level of political repression.
228 Voeux, 2006: The reporter stated that the names of the dissidents had asterisks and other punctuation 
marks between the letters of their names in an effort to make them illegible to government censorship 
software, but that “this precaution turned out to be insufficient.” However, it could be that the system 
was triggered by the source IP or email address of the Reporter Without Borders’ author of the email.

Although Burma now has a population of 54 million, only around 110,000 of its 
citizens can connect to the web – around 0.2% - through a funnel of roughly 170 
Internet-connected computers.230
In Africa, Eritrea has played an infamous role as the last country to go online and 
the first to go offline. In November 2000, Eritrea opened its first national gateway to 
the Internet, with a capacity of 512 Kbps.231 Within five years, about 70,000 people 
had accessed the web, mostly from a “walk-in” ISP.
There was no initial censorship of the web, but in 2001, human rights in Eritrea 
began to deteriorate. In 2004, all cyber cafés were physically transferred to govern-
ment “educational and research” centers. The official reason was to control pornog-
raphy, but international diplomats are skeptical of this explanation.
Historically, oral traditions in Africa have played a powerful role in fostering na-
tional solidarity. Radio and clandestine radio stations in the Horn of Africa are skill-
fully employed by both government and anti-government forces. One transmitter 
in the Sudan, for example, has hosted three separate anti-Eritrean radio stations 
simultaneously.
Given the low level of Internet usage in Africa, political battles are slow to shift 
from the radio spectrum to cyberspace. However, via the web even the most paro-
chial factions are able to appeal to the entire world, thereby creating international 
political and economic support for their cause. Sites such as Pan-African News and 
Eritrea Online offer a growing amount of information and analysis, and their influ-
ence will only grow over time. Today, Eritrea has a population of around 6 million, 
of which only about 200,000 connect to the web.232
Two thousand miles to the south, the government of Zimbabwe is engaged in a 
deadly game of information warfare against its own citizens.
In October 2006, President Robert Mugabe reportedly met with his Central Intel-
ligence Organisation (CIO) for the purpose of infiltrating Zim Internet service pro-
viders (ISP). Operatives were to “flush out” journalists using the Internet to send 
“negative” information to international media. The police worked as cyber café at-
tendants and posed as web surfers. A police spokesman confirmed that the govern-
ment would do “all it can” to prevent citizens from writing “falsehoods against the 
government.” Jail terms were up to 20 years in length.

The Zim Interception of Communications Bill (ICB) forced ISPs to purchase special 
hardware and monitoring software from the government. No court challenges to 
government intercepts are allowed. Some ISPs threatened to shut down in protest.
In terms of national telecommunications infrastructure, Zimbabwe has followed a
