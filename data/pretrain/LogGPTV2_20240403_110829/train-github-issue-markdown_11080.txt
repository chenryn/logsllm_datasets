#### Description
I got a DeprecationWarning with the imp module since i update my python
version to python 3.7.  
Here is the message
> XXX\site-
> packages\sklearn\externals\joblib\externals\cloudpickle\cloudpickle.py:47:
> DeprecationWarning: the imp module is deprecated in favour of importlib; see
> the module's documentation for alternative uses
#### Steps/Code to Reproduce
`import sklearn`
#### Possible corrections
modify cloudpickle.py file and replace following lines by following values
  * l.47: `import importlib`
  * l.937: `mod = types.ModuleType(name)`
  * l.1138: `file, path, description = importlib.util._find_spec(part, path)`
I'm quite a newby on GitHub, I don't really know how to use pull request and
evrything so i post my solution here as if it is a bit ugly...
#### Versions
On Windows10 environment.  
Python 3.7.0  
sklean 0.20.0
