RPA systems will enable seamless distribution of process execution (something
eminentlyachievablewithcurrentagenttechnology).Thiswillalsolikelyinvolve
elements of edge computing (driven by similar considerations underpinning cur-
rent deployments of edge computing).
4.5 Distributed Optimization
Whilebusinessprocessoptimizationhasreceivedconsiderableresearchattention
[26], and some modicum of tool support, very little attention has been paid to
theproblemofdistributedoptimization.Thenotionofdistributionhereincludes
geographicdistribution,butalsodistributionovermultiplelocifordecisionmak-
ing and multiple actuators (or effectors or business process execution engines).

Theoptimizationexercisecanapplytodesign-timeartefacts(plans,coordination
models,businessprocessdesignsetc.)ortorun-timeartefacts(executingagents,
business process instances and such). For a simple example, consider a situation
where seeking agreement from a customer to wait for a few hours can lead to
better alignment with the trucking providers schedule (leading to discounts in
trucking costs) thus leading to an overall reduction in costs incurred by both
the producer and customer. This is a clear instance of run-time optimization,
but if this is a repeated pattern, it can also play out at design time. Future
RPA systems will be able to exploit such opportunities by leveraging enterprise
business process architectures [10] and techniques for managing the designs of
businessprocessecosystems[12].Forrun-timeoptimization,techniquesforsolv-
ing Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOP) such as [3].
5 Novel Forms of Governance
In this section, we summarize future prospects for RPA systems governance.
Normative Governance: Future RPA systems will need to be governed as a
socio-technical system based on norm-driven agents. In this conception [24] the
socio-technical system will be populated by agents (humans or machines/RPA
systems) each of which retain individual autonomy but are incentivized to com-
ply with a set of norms that govern inter-agent interactions (obligations, pro-
hibitions and such). This approach offers the opportunity to ensure that the
behaviour of the overall multi-agent RPA system meets the required objectives
while not removing the opportunities for autonomous behaviour on the part of
the constituent agents.

Consequently,producingagenericsummarythatcansatisfyeveryonemakestheprob-

challengetoproducesummariesthatcansatisfyallusers.
Traditional state-of-the-art approaches produce only a single, globally short sum-

outconsideringusers’interestsandneedsinseekingtheirdesiredinformation[3].How-
ever,thisisnotusefulinreal-worldscenarioswheredifferentusersmayexplorediverse
interests in the same corpus, thus need a distinct summary. Furthermore, these high-
level interests vary over time. To be more specific, a person might be interested in a
differentareabasedonbackgroundknowledge,andcontextduetotheircognitivebias.
For instance, there is various information available on the Internet about COVID-19.

locations, while others are searching about the death toll. An example of background
knowledgeiswhenaresearcherworksonaresearchtopic,forinstance,“Summariza-
tion”. She could be eager to know what is the definition of summarization. Then her
interestmayturntodifferentcategoriesofsummarization,suchasextractiveorabstrac-
tiveapproaches.Therefore,agoodsummaryshouldchangecorrespondinglybasedon
theinterestandpreferenceofitsreader.
A recent definition of summarization is given by Radev et al. [30] as “a text that
is produced from one or more texts, which conveys the important information in the
original text, and usually significantly less than that.” However, the importance inter-
pretationinthisdefinitionisdifferentevenforonepersonaccordingtotheneed,time,

Previousapproachesmainlyselectthemostinformativesentencesasthesummaryand
try to employ users’ feedback in selecting sentences, not content, which makes the
summaries vague. Therefore, it would be advantageous if users can interact with the
system to incorporate their desired information into the summary. While there exist

[37–39]. In this setting, users can give feedback in an iterative loop in selecting or
rejecting a concept, defining the level of importance or being unrelated, and giving
the confidence level in their feedback. By doing this, we allow even novice users
to interactively explore, manipulate, and analyze sizeable unstructured text document
