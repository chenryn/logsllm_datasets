I appreciate the new feature and would like to suggest a few improvements. I'm open to discussing these, of course.

Let's consider a simple use case: I have a file named `.babelrc`, which is a JSON file. However, VS Code detects it as Plain Text. When I click on the language mode indicator in the bottom right corner to change it to `JSON`, I see two options: "Auto Detect" and "Configure File Association for .babelrc."

1. **Auto Detection Improvement:**
   - When I select "Auto Detect," the file remains classified as Plain Text. I would expect the "Auto Detect" feature to intelligently recognize that the file is in JSON format. We could enhance this by starting with common configuration files like JSON, YAML, or others. If "Auto Detect" is not adding significant value, we might consider removing it, as VS Code already seems to be auto-detecting file types.

2. **Configuration Guidance:**
   - When I choose "Configure File Association for .babelrc," I am directed to the `settings.json` file. A popup appears, informing me that a restart may be necessary, but there are no further instructions or guidance on what to do next. It would be helpful to provide a prompt or a step-by-step guide, similar to the approach @alexandrudima used for keybindings. This could include highlighting the specific setting that needs to be configured or providing a navigation path. This would make the process more intuitive, especially for new users.

3. **Persistent File Associations:**
   - After manually setting `.babelrc` to `JSON`, the file behaves as expected. However, when I close and reopen the file, it reverts to Plain Text. I would expect the file association to persist, at least within the current workspace. One solution could be to automatically save the file association so that I don't need to reconfigure it every time I open the file.

These are just some initial thoughts, and I look forward to your feedback.
