I like this new feature... I have some suggested improvements. Open to
discussion of course :)
Let's take a simple use case. I have a file `.babelrc`. This file is a JSON
file. VS Code detects it as Plain Text. I click in the bottom right to change
it to `JSON`. I see that there are two options "Auto Detect" and "Configure
file association for .babelrc".
I try "Auto Detect". The file is still Plain Text. (1) I would expect Auto
Detect to intelligently figure out I am using JSON.
I try "Configure file association for .babelrc." I am taken to settings.json.
A popup explains that I may need to restart. I don't see any instructions nor
do I know where to look. (2) I am not sure how to proceed.
I try setting `.babelrc` to JSON. This works as expected. I close the file and
come back to it. Its back to Plain Text. (3) I would have expected it to stay
JSON.
Couple of ideas. For (1) can we intelligently figure out what the file is? We
could start with a JSON file or other common configuration files. Also, what
is "Auto Detect" supposed to do? It seems like we're already auto detecting
every single file. We could consider dropping it.
(2) We should provide some prompt for settings. Even a navigation and
highlighting of the settings command that needs to be configured would be
helpful. This could be similar to what @alexandrudima did for keybindings. As
it stands, I need to know to trigger suggest to know what to type. This isn't
obvious, especially for new users.
(3) What if VS Code saved a file's association automatically. For example if I
set .babelrc to JSON, I would expect there to be an association and never have
to do it again (at least for the workspace I am in).
Just some thoughts.
