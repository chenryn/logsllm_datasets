I am planning to develop a console application in Python that should be compatible with both Windows and Linux. For this, I would like to use a high-level console library such as `curses`. However, I understand that `curses` is not natively available on Windows.

What are my other options for achieving cross-platform compatibility? Unfortunately, using Cygwin on Windows is not an option for me.

Thank you for your help!

One approach to address your requirement for a cross-platform console application is to use a library that provides `curses`-like functionality and is compatible with both Windows and Linux. One such library is `windows-curses`, which is a Windows port of the `curses` library. This way, you can write your application using `curses` and it will work on both platforms.

Another alternative is to use a higher-level library like `prompt_toolkit`, which is designed to be cross-platform and offers a rich set of features for building interactive command-line applications.

If you prefer to avoid additional dependencies, you can also consider writing platform-specific code and using conditional imports to handle the differences between Windows and Linux. For example, you can use `curses` on Linux and a simpler, custom solution or a different library on Windows.

While it is true that graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are more common on Windows, there are still many use cases where a text-based interface is preferred, especially for system administration and automation tasks. Therefore, developing a cross-platform console application can still be very valuable.

I hope this helps, and feel free to ask if you have any more questions!
