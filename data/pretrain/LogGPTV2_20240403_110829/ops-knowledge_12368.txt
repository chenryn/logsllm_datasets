User: I'm looking into developing a console application in python which should be able to run under Windows as well as Linux. For this, I'd really like to use a high-level console library like curses. However, as far as I know, curses is not available on Windows.
What other options do I have? Unfortunately, using cygwin under Windows is not an option...
Thanks for your help!
Assistant: develop two interfaces for your program, a text console ui and a graphical ui. Make the console one work only on linux. Nobody on windows uses text console apps.
