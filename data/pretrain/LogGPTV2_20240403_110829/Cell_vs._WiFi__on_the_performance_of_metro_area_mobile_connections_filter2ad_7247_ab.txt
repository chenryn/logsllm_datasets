### Test Data Details

The data from the local Ookla server includes:
- Client IP address
- Device type and OS version
- Client geographic coordinates (longitude/latitude)
- Server name and coordinates
- Great-circle distance from client to server (computed using the Haversine formula)
- Timestamp
- Upload and download speeds (in kb/s)
- Latency (in milliseconds)
- Access type (cellular or WiFi)
- Cellular carrier or WiFi network provider

For Android devices, more granular information about specific cellular access types (e.g., EDGE, HSPA, EVDO-A, LTE) is available. For iOS devices, only the general access type (cell or WiFi) is known. Each device has a unique fingerprint that allows for the identification of measurements initiated by the same handset, even if the test is conducted using different access technologies or from different service providers.

### Data Sets Considered

The data used in our initial evaluation were collected from servers in 15 metro areas over a period of 15 weeks from February 21, 2011, to June 5, 2011. The metro areas include:
- **Small US Cities:** Lawrence, KS; Jackson, TN; Missoula, MT
- **Medium US Cities:** Madison, WI; Syracuse, NY; Columbia, SC
- **Large US Cities:** New York, NY; Los Angeles, CA; Chicago, IL
- **European Cities:** Belgrade, Serbia; Brussels, Belgium; Manchester, UK
- **Asia/Pacific Cities:** Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia; Almaty, Kazakhstan; Palembang, Indonesia

The selection of these areas was based on their diverse geographic, socio-economic, and behavioral characteristics. The specific geographic boundaries for US metro areas are defined by the US Census Bureau, while European and Asian markets do not have standardized definitions. Therefore, we included tests within a 100 km radius of each server.

### Test Statistics

- **Average Daily Tests:**
  - Total: 7,551 handsets (3,863 iOS, 3,688 Android)
  - Cellular: 14,961
  - WiFi: 15,521
  - Android: 11,273 (cellular), 4,380 (WiFi)
  - iOS: 2,464 (cellular), 11,141 (WiFi)

- **Handset Diversity:**
  - Unique devices and device/OS pairs per site, as well as the top three devices (and percentage share) for each site.

### Geographic Analysis

Each test includes highly accurate GPS-derived geographic coordinates. While we cannot determine if a client was moving during a single test, consecutive tests in close proximity suggest that some tests were conducted while users were traveling. Maps of test locations show that in large metro areas, tests are more uniformly distributed, while in smaller areas, there are clusters in densely populated subregions.

### Discussion

**Strengths:**
- Richness and broad adoption of Speedtest data.
- Availability in a large number of markets.

**Limitations:**
- Crowd-sourced nature of the data, leading to potential biases.
- Variability in device configurations, especially with jail-broken devices.
- Lack of information on indoor/outdoor testing conditions.
- Difficulty in establishing performance baselines and assessing testing bias.
- Limited spatial analysis due to incomplete data on cell towers and WiFi access points.

### Economic Considerations

- Users: Subject to data transfer limits and traffic shaping.
- Service Providers: Infrastructure density decisions based on user growth, risks, and geographic expansion.
- Application Designers: Need to manage data transfers to ensure acceptable user experience.

### Evaluation Methodology

Our evaluation takes a top-down approach to assess the spatio-temporal performance characteristics of cellular and WiFi throughput and latency in the target metro areas.

#### Basic Performance Characteristics

- Calculation of maximum, average, minimum, and standard deviation of performance for each technology over the 15-week period.
- Analysis of per-handset performance measures, including median, mean, and 95th percentile for throughput and latency.
- Scatterplots of upload vs. download throughput to compare performance across different networks and access technologies.
- Consistency measures using normalized per-handset throughput and latency performance.

#### Temporal Characteristics

- Diurnal patterns of Internet traffic and their impact on performance.
- Aggregation of hourly test invocations and average hourly performance for cellular and WiFi.
- Identification and characterization of anomalous events such as outages and periods of degraded service.

This structured approach allows us to draw meaningful conclusions about the relative capabilities and robustness of cellular and WiFi technologies in various metro areas.
