Introduction
What is it about?
SAML = Security Assertion Markup Language
This relates to
SAML Token and Claims
based IAM
Low level, Pen-tester approach
Won’t discuss
Formal protocol/API
comparison
Consistent standards study
Standards ”reverse engineering”: Find vulns, see what’s wrong in specs
Take-aways
Tool to play with SAML protected Web app
Proven assumption: Standards can be read as an attempt to
circumvent SOP
Important design security considerations

Joining a federation usually has severe contractual, legal

Where we come from
The main problem to solve
User and Administrator friendly cross organization boundaries
SSO - here for web apps
Secure
Scalable
Manageable
Privacy / Anonymity
Ideally compliant with the Laws of Identity [1]

Historical approaches
The good old time
Account Replication
Manual
Automated
WHAT?
Lose control of accounts
Have multiple passwords
”Trust” relationships to be established with other realms /
domains
All user information shared with federated partners
Firewalls need to be opened to allow trust
Bilateral ⇒ n2 problem - no easy way to establish trust with
multiple partners
Privacy / anonymity
Anonymity Support for Kerberos [2]

What are SAML Assertions?
Signed XML document containing claims or attributes about
a user
Collected Claims = Identity
Claims do not need to unambiguously identify user. Only
relevant information (e.g. Age > 21, so can buy booze) [5]

How is SAML used?
Standards-based (so widely supported, supposedly
interoperable), including:
XML Encryption, XML Digital Signatures, X.509
Relies on standard HTTP (so passes through ﬁrewalls and
across Internet)
Local network (not just for Federation!)
Branch oﬃces
Remote workers
But also supports federation (of which more, later)
Supports SSO (no need to remember lots of passwords)
Transparent to user (from web browser or compiled
application): a single click, and the magic happens!

How does it work?
Web Browser SSO Proﬁle (SP-Initiated SSO - Redirect/POST Bindings)
1 User requests access to a claims aware web application
2 Redirected (through 302 Redirection) to IdP
3 Authenticates to IdP (either through Kerberos or
Username/Password)
4 Redirected (through HTTP POST) back to web application,
including security token
5 Happy User − no passwords to remember
+
Happy Administrator/Developer − much easier to manage
