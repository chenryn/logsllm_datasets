10 Conclusion
Embedded sensors in a control loop play important roles
in the correct functioning of control systems. A wide
range of control systems depend on the timely feedback
of MEMS inertial sensors to make critical decisions. In
this work, we devised two sets of novel attacks against
embedded inertial sensors to deceive the system. Our at-
tack evaluations on 25 devices showed that it is possible
to deliver implicit control to different kinds of systems
by non-invasive attacks.
We characterized the out-of-band signal
injection
model and methods to manipulate an oscillating digitized
signal, which was often considered as noises, to deliver
adversarial control. To explore the generalizability of our
methods, we showed that the oscillating digitized signal
could also be manipulated by sending analog signals at
relatively low frequencies through the sensing channel.
