Abstract—Accelerometer-based gait recognition for mobile
healthcare systems has became an attractive research topic in
the past years. However, a major bottleneck of such system is
it requires continuous sampling of accelerometer, which reduces
battery life of wearable sensors. In this paper, we present KEH-
Gait, which advocates use of output voltage signal from kinetic
energy harvester (KEH) as the source for gait recognition. KEH-
Gait is motivated by the prospect of signiﬁcant power saving by
not having to sample the accelerometer at all. Indeed, our mea-
surements show that, compared to conventional accelerometer-
based gait detection, KEH-Gait can reduce energy consumption
by 78.15%. The feasibility of KEH-Gait is based on the fact
that human gait has distinctive movement patterns for different
individuals, which is expected to leave distinctive patterns for
KEH as well. We evaluate the performance of KEH-Gait using
two different types of KEH hardware on a data set of 20 subjects.
Our experiments demonstrate that, although KEH-Gait yields
slightly lower accuracy than accelerometer-based gait detection
when single step is used, the accuracy problem can be overcome
by the proposed Multi-Step Sparse Representation Classiﬁcation
(MSSRC). We discuss the advantages and limitations of our
approach in detail and give practical insights to the use of KEH
in a real-world environment.

INTRODUCTION
With rapid advancements in embedded technology, wear-
able devices and Implantable Medical Devices (IMDs) have
become an integral part of our everyday life. It is predicted
that by 2025, the market for personal wearable devices will
reach 70 billion dollar. The major deployments of those devices
are expected to be in health monitoring and medical assistance
domains [1], [2]. Some popular wearable devices, such as Fitbit
and Apple Watch, are already monitoring and storing a mass of
sensitive health data about the user. The private information of
users can be further explored to provide a variety of emerging
applications in the healthcare area. For example, the collected
sensory data can be explored for the understanding of user’s
physical and mental health states [3].

However, such wearable systems are vulnerable to imper-
sonation attacks in which an adversary can easily distribute
his device to other users so that data collected from these
users can be claimed to be his own. In this way, the attacker
can claim potential healthcare proﬁts that are allocated to
people with certain illnesses even though he may not have
any illnesses [4]. For instance, a policy holder may obtain
a fraudulent insurance discount from a healthcare insurance
company by using other people’s health data. Another example
is that in a mobile healthcare system for disease propagation
control [5], an attacker can obtain additional vaccine allocation
by launching user impersonation attacks and thus compromise
the regular operations of such systems.
To mitigate the risk of malicious attacks, most wearable
devices rely on explicit manual entry of a secret PIN number.
However, due to the small screens of wearable devices and
frequent unlocking requests, it is inconvenient for users to enter
the keys manually. Furthermore, this method is not applicable
when an adversary colludes with other users to spoof the
healthcare company.
Gait
recognition using wearable sensors, such as ac-
celerometers, has emerged as one of the most promising
solutions for user authentication. It offers several advantages
over other biometrics especially when applied in wearables.
For instance, although ﬁngerprint and face have been proposed
for user authentication on smartphones, ﬁngerprint readers and
cameras are not always available on wearable devices such
as pacemakers and smart watches. In comparison, because
walking is a daily activity, the main advantages of gait are its
availability and spontaneity. Furthermore, gait is non-intrusive,
and can be measured without subject intervention or knowl-
edge [6]. This motivates us using gait as a biometric. Extensive
previous studies have already demonstrated its feasibility in
user authentication [7], [8], [9], but they have also shown that
continuous accelerometer sampling drains the battery quickly.
High power consumption of accelerometer sampling, which
is typically in the order of a few milliwatts, also makes it
challenging to adopt gait-based user authentication in resource-
constrained wearables. Although power consumption may be
not a big issue for wearables with large batteries such as
smartphone, other wearables like IMDs suffer from short
battery life because IMDs are long-lived devices and battery
replacement requires surgical intervention [10].
A vision for wearable devices is to be battery-free (self-
powered). A current trend in battery-free devices is to in-
vestigate kinetic energy harvesting (KEH) solutions to power
the wearable devices [11], [12], [13], [14]. However, one
fundamental problem in KEH is that the amount of power that
can be practically harvested from human motions is insufﬁcient
to meet the power requirement of accelerometer for accurate
activity recognition [15]. As reported in [11],
the amount
of power that can be harvested from human motion is only
in the order of tens to hundreds of microwatts. This 2-3
orders of magnitude gap between power consumption and
power harvesting is the biggest obstacle for realising gait-
based authentication in batteryless wearables. Although the
power consumption of sensors has been largely reduced in
the last years thanks to the Ultra-Low-Power electronics [16],
we believe in the near future energy harvesting will be used
to augment or substitute batteries. For example, AMPY [17]
has released the world’s ﬁrst wearable motion-charger which
can transform the kinetic energy from user’s motion into
battery power. SOLEPOWER [18] produces smart boots that
use user’s steps to power embedded lights, sensors, and GPS.
KINERGIZER has developed a small piezoelectric generator
with the ability to harvest energy at low frequencies to produce
as much as 200µW of power [19].
Motivated by this prospect, we propose gait recognition by
simply observing the output voltages of KEH. The feasibility
of the proposed idea is based on the observation that if humans
have unique walking patterns, then the corresponding patterns
of harvested power from KEH should be unique too. The pro-
posed system offers several advantages. The major advantage
of KEH-based gait recognition is the potential for signiﬁcant
power savings arising from not sampling accelerometer at
all. On the other hand, the output voltage can be used to
charge the battery, thus further extending battery life. Finally,
as energy harvester will be integrated in wearable devices in
the near future, the output voltage can be naturally utilized for
authentication purpose without introducing extra sensors. This
makes it a promising solution for light-weight authentication
for wearable devices. The main challenge of implementing
such a system is achieving high recognition accuracy by using
a 1-axis voltage signal rather than 3-axis accelerometer signals.
We address this issue by proposing a novel sparse fusion
method which exploits the information from multiple steps.
To the best of our knowledge,
this is the ﬁrst work that
proposes and experimentally validates the feasibility of gait
recognition using KEH. The main contributions of this paper
are as follows:
• We propose a novel gait-based user authentication
system for mobile healthcare system, called KEH-
Gait, which uses only KEH voltage as the source
signal to achieve user authentication.
• We build two different KEH prototypes, one based on
piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) and the other on
electromagnetic energy harvester (EEH). Using these
KEH devices, we evaluate gait recognition accuracy
of KEH-Gait over 20 subjects. Our results show that,
with conventional classiﬁcation techniques, which op-
erate over single step, KEH-Gait achieves approxi-
mately 6% lower accuracy compared to accelerometer-
based gait recognition.
• We demonstrate that authentication accuracy of KEH-
Gait can be increased to that of accelerometer-based
•
gait detection by employing a novel classiﬁcation
method, called Multi-Step Sparse Representation Clas-
siﬁcation (MSSRC), which efﬁciently fuses informa-
tion from multiple steps.
Finally, using measurements, we demonstrate that
currently available microprocessors can read KEH
voltage within 33 µs, which is two orders of mag-
nitude faster than what it takes to wakeup, interro-
gate and read acceleration values from typical 3-axis
accelerometers. This means that with microproces-
sor duty cycling, KEH-Gait promises major energy
savings over conventional accelerometer-based gait
detection.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Sec II
provides technical background on energy harvesting devices.
Sec III introduces trust models and attacker models of gait-
based authentication system. Sec IV presents the system archi-
tecture of KEH-Gait. Prototyping of KEH wearables and gait
data collection are described in Sec V. We present evaluation
results in Sec VI, and analyze power consumption in Sec VII.
We have a discussion of our work in Sec VIII and introduce
related work in Sec IX before concluding the paper in Sec X.

Vibration-based energy harvesting has received growing
attention over the last decade. The research motivation in
this ﬁeld is due to the reduced power requirement of small
electronic components, such as the wireless sensor networks
used in passive and active monitoring applications. The three
basic vibration-to-electric energy conversion mechanisms are
the piezoelectric [20], electromagnetic [21], [22] and electro-
static [23].
As electrostatic usually needs external voltage source, we
built two proof-of-concept prototypes based on piezoelectric
and electromagnetic respectively. Therefore, we brieﬂy de-
scribe piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) and electromag-
netic energy harvester (EEH) to make the paper self-contained.
The piezoelectric effect converts mechanical strain into electric
current or voltage. This strain can come from many different
sources, such as human motions and low-frequency seismic
vibrations. Figure 1(a) shows a basic design of PEH. Piezo-
electric vibrational energy harvesters are usually inertial mass
based devices, where a cantilever with a piezoelectric outer
layer is excited into resonance by a vibration source at the root
of the cantilever. The inertial mass is located on a vibrating
host structure and the dynamic strain induced in the piezo-
electric layer results in an alternating voltage output. Unlike
piezoelectric, the basic principle of electromagnetic generators
are based on Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction. As
shown in Figure 1(b), the voltage, or electromotive force is
2
generated when an electric conductor is moved through a
magnetic ﬁeld. Because of the small size and light weight,
PEH is promising for hand-held and wearable devices such as
wristwatches (e.g., the SEIKO Kinetic watch1), on the other
hand, due to the weight of magnet, EEH usually has a larger
weight and may not be embedded in the wearable devices,
but can be used as an external mobile power source (e.g., the
AMPY Move mobile charger).

We envision the use of KEH-Gait primarily in resource-
constrained healthcare monitoring wearable devices to authen-
ticate the identity of the user to prevent spoof attack. KEH-
Gait addresses the issue of short battery life by using an energy
harvester to replace an accelerometer. In the near future, energy
harvesters can even be integrated in the hardware system to
achieve battery-free wearable devices. Figure 2 illustrates the
workﬂow of a typical healthcare monitoring system. In such a
system, each user is given a unique user ID and a monitoring
application which runs on a wearable device that can collect
private sensor data and transmit them to the data centre of
a healthcare company. Before transmission, the device ﬁrst
collects gait data and transmits them to the sever. The server
will then perform authentication to verify the user’s identity
by using the gait data. If the user passes authentication, the
further private data like blood pressure or heart rate are then
transmitted to the server. While if the user veriﬁcation fails,
i.e.,
the sensor data
collected from this user’s device will not be reported to the
server. In the server, sensor data will be analysed and processed
by the healthcare company to derive user’s physical and mental
conditions. For instance, the measurements of heartbeats and
blood pressure can be used to predict user’s psychological
conditions. A wide range of applications can also be enabled
by such mobile healthcare systems and some examples are:
the user spooﬁng attack is detected,
•
•
User’s physical behaviors are often reﬂection of phys-
ical and mental health and can be used by healthcare
companies to facilitate early prediction of future health
problems like depression [3].
Health food companies can make advertisement by
cooperating with healthcare related applications such
as “IDOMOVE”2, e.g., providing discount coupons for
users who walk more than 1hr a day.
For some applications, continuous authentication may be
unnecessary. However, one-time validation of the users identity
is becoming insufﬁcient for modern devices and applications
that process sensitive data. A simple example is the mobile
phone will lock the screen and demand users to enter their
PIN every few minutes. Such situations might beneﬁt from a
seamless authentication approach that incorporates continuous
veriﬁcation of the user’s identity. KEH-Gait leverages gait
which is a common daily activity to provide unobtrusive and
continuous authentication without user intervention. There are
also many commercial products that provide biometrics-based
continuous authentication systems such as BehavioSec3 and
Eyeﬂuence4.
A. Trust Model
In this paper, we assume the data collected by sensors built
in the wearable devices are trustworthy. Also, our system trusts
the communication channel between the wearable device and
the healthcare company’s server. We discuss the feasibility of
our assumption as follows.
Tamper-resistant Sensor. An attack can physically ac-
cesses to the sensor or chipset and manipulate the recorded
data. To make sure the device has not been modiﬁed, a health-
care company can apply tamper-resistant techniques [24]. As
mentioned in [25], ARM TrustZone extension can also be used
to ensure the integrity of the sensors [26].
