It appears that the `User-Agent` header set by Symfony2 BrowserKit is incorrect. I have been troubleshooting an issue with Behat for a few hours, trying to test a site running on an IIS6 server (the same problem occurs with IIS7). The server responds with:

```
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request (Invalid Header Name)
```

and returns no body.

To investigate further, I used `tshark` to inspect the headers being sent. Here are the relevant details from the capture:

```
Hypertext Transfer Protocol
GET / HTTP/1..1\r\n
[Expert Info (Chat/Sequence): GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n]
[Message: GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n]
[Severity level: Chat]
[Group: Sequence]
Request Method: GET
Request URI: /
Request Version: HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Guzzle/3.3.0 curl/7.24.0 PHP/5.3.15\r\n
User-agent: Symfony2 BrowserKit\r\n
Host: ******\r\n
\r\n
```

I suspect that the "User-agent" header declaration is invalid. It should be "User-Agent" with a capital "A". Additionally, I am unsure if multiple `User-Agent` fields are allowed in the request. 

Does anyone have any thoughts or suggestions on this issue?
