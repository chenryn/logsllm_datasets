### Trends in 𝐶𝐴 → 𝐶𝐷𝑁 Dependency (2016 vs. 2020)

| Transition | 2016 to 2020 |
| --- | --- |
| No CDN to Third-Party CDN | 2 (9.5%) |
| Third-Party CDN to No CDN | 0 (0.0%) |
| Single Third-Party CDN to Private | 1 (4.76%) |
| Private to Third-Party CDN | 0 (+0%) |

**Table 8: Trends in 𝐶𝐴 → 𝐶𝐷𝑁 dependency from 2016 to 2020.**

There is no significant change in the critical dependency of CAs. Specifically, two CAs, including a major one like Let's Encrypt, moved from having no CDN in 2016 to using a third-party CDN in 2020. Conversely, two CAs have also transitioned from using third-party CDNs to not using any CDNs in 2020. Overall, the third-party and critical dependencies have remained relatively unchanged.

### 𝐶𝐷𝑁 −→ 𝐷𝑁𝑆 Dependency

We observed a total of 86 CDNs, with 31 (36%) using a third-party DNS provider. Of these, 15 (17.4%) are critically dependent, as shown in Table 6. However, these critically dependent CDNs support only 1.5% of the top-100K websites using CDNs, indicating that they are not significant providers.

Additionally, 290 additional websites are now dependent on a third party because they use a private CDN that, in turn, uses a third-party DNS provider. These websites include prominent ones such as twitter.com, airbnb.com, and squarespace.com.

**Observation 11:** Major CDN providers typically use private DNS, resulting in little to no change in the impact of DNS providers due to the 𝐶𝐷𝑁 → 𝐷𝑁𝑆 dependency. Figures 9a and 9b illustrate the changes in concentration and impact of the top 5 DNS providers, respectively, when considering this dependency. There is no significant change in the concentration of major providers, as they use private DNS. Only Fastly, among the top 5 CDN providers, uses a third-party DNS provider, Dyn. We observed that AWS DNS serves 16 of the CDNs, 7 of which use AWS exclusively. However, these 7 CDNs serve only 2% of the top-100K websites using a CDN.

### Trends in 𝐶𝐷𝑁 → 𝐷𝑁𝑆 Dependency (2016 vs. 2020)

| Transition | 2016 to 2020 |
| --- | --- |
| Private to Single Third-Party | 0 (0.0%) |
| Single Third-Party to Private | 1 (2.1%) |
| Redundancy to No Redundancy | 1 (2.1%) |
| No Redundancy to Redundancy | 2 (4.25%) |
| Critical Dependency | -2 (-4.25%) |

**Table 9: Trends in 𝐶𝐷𝑁 → 𝐷𝑁𝑆 dependency from 2016 to 2020.**

In 2016, out of 47 distinct CDNs, 12 (25.5%) used third-party DNS providers, and 8 (17%) were critically dependent on a single third-party DNS provider. By 2020, 2 CDNs (Netlify, Kinx CDN) adopted redundancy, and 1 (GoCache) moved to a private DNS. However, 1 redundantly provisioned CA (Zenedge) in 2016 has moved to a single third-party CDN in 2020. Consequently, critical dependency has decreased by 4.25%.

### Additional Case Studies

#### Case Study I - Hospitals

Internet outages for hospitals can disrupt operations, such as electronic health record (EHR) systems, electronic prescription transfers, and emails. For instance, a DDoS attack on March 22, 2020, targeted the Paris hospital authority AP-HP, which manages 39 public hospitals, during the coronavirus pandemic. In the 2016 Dyn attack, AthenaHealth and AllScripts also suffered outages because they used Dyn.

We analyzed third-party DNS, CDN, and CA dependencies in the top 200 US hospitals. Table 10 shows the percentage of hospitals that use third-party services and their critical dependencies. 51% of the hospitals use a third-party DNS, and only 6% have redundancy. GoDaddy DNS is the most concentrated provider, covering 13% of these hospitals. 

**Table 10: Trends in third-party dependency of top 200 US hospitals.**

| Service | Third-Party Dependency | Critical Dependency |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DNS | 102 (51%) | 32 (16%) |
| CDN | 200 (100%) | 92 (46%) |
| CA | 156 (78%) | 32 (16%) |

Hospitals are as critically dependent as websites, but with less prevalence of third-party dependencies. 

#### Case Study II - Smart Home Companies

Outages in smart home services can have serious consequences, such as the 2017 Amazon S3 outage, which caused many smart home devices (locks, lights, etc.) to malfunction. We analyzed 23 smart home companies, including frameworks like Samsung SmartThings, Yonomi, and Amazon, and devices like Lifx and Philips Hue. Of these, 14 operate locally and on the cloud, while 9 are cloud-only.

**Table 11: Trends in third-party dependency of top smart home companies.**

| Service | Third-Party Dependency | Redundancy | Critical Dependency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DNS | 21 (91.3%) | 1 (4.43%) | 8 (34.7%) |
| Cloud | 15 (65.2%) | 0 (0%) | 5 (21.7%) |

Only 3 companies (Philips Hue, Apple Homekit, and Amazon Alexa) use a private DNS, and only 1 company uses redundancy. Of the remaining 21, 13 have local fail-over, making 8 critically dependent. These trends are similar to those observed in Alexa websites.

In terms of cloud usage, all companies use the cloud, with 15 using third-party cloud services. None of these are redundantly provisioned, and 5 lack local fail-over, making them critically dependent on their cloud provider. These include Petnet, IFTTT, Logitech Harmony, Ecobee, and Ring Security. Additionally, 11 of the 15 smart home companies that use a third-party cloud use Amazon, and 13 use Amazon DNS. Overall, third-party and critical dependencies in smart home companies follow similar trends to those in Alexa websites.

### Discussion

**Trends of Concern:**
- **Critical Inter-service Dependencies:** Critical dependencies between service providers increase the exposure of websites to risks. Indirect dependencies amplify the number of critical dependencies per website.
- **Lessons Learned:** Between 2016 and 2020, there was a 1% to 5% increase in critical dependency in websites. While some providers impacted by the Dyn attack have adapted, the lessons learned have been acted upon by only a few.
- **Increasing Concentration:** The increasing concentration of service providers creates potential single points of failure, making them attractive targets for malicious actors.
- **Prevalence Across Sectors:** Preliminary case studies suggest that third-party dependencies are prevalent across sectors, leaving them vulnerable to incidents like the Dyn attack.

**Recommendations:**
- **Websites:** Websites should build more resilience and redundancy into their use of third-party services. They should also understand the hidden dependencies of these services to avoid indirect exposure to potential threats.
- **Service Providers:** Service providers should support and encourage redundancy. For example, Dyn offers "secondary" DNS configurations to mitigate risks.
