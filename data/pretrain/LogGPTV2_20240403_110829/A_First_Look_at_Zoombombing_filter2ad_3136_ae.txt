### Identifying Insider-Initiated Zoombombing Attacks

To determine whether a zoombombing attack is initiated by an insider, we look for two key indicators:
1. **Language Indicating Insider Involvement:** Phrases like “my lecture,” “my colleague’s presentation,” or “my company’s meeting” suggest that the call to action comes from someone with inside knowledge.
2. **Insider Knowledge Sharing:** The individual calling for the attack shares specific details about the meeting that only an insider would know.

**Findings:**
- Out of 58 zoombombing threads on 4chan and 19 zoombombing tweets, 58 threads and 19 tweets included language indicating insider involvement.
- In 8 zoombombing threads and 8 zoombombing tweets, the attacker provided additional information, such as suggesting names to use when joining the meeting to avoid detection.
- Examples of insider-specific instructions:
  - "Use [PARTICIPANTSNAME] in all caps or she won’t let you in."
  - "Please use real-sounding names."

In 11 threads, the attacker's insider status was confirmed through their interactions with other users. For instance:
- "Same school as you, different major. Someone wrote 'NIGGERS' in my Zoom class with the annotate function and started a Zoom fight."

**Summary:**
- We identified 86 out of 123 zoombombing threads on 4chan as being posted by insiders (38/54 for Zoom, 35/46 for Google Meet, 8/10 for Cisco Webex, 3/3 for Skype, 0/2 for GoToMeeting, 2/7 for Jitsi, and 0/1 for Teams).
- On Twitter, 78 out of 95 zoombombing tweets were posted by insiders.

### Failed Calls to Attack

- Out of 123 threads, 100 started with an invitation to bomb, but 46 of these received no further replies, indicating that the call to action was not successful.
- Of the 77 threads with replies, 54 were initiated with an invitation to bomb, while 23 were created with more general topics (e.g., politics, COVID-19) and later converted into bombing threads.
- Threads with general topics tend to attract more posts than those specifically about bombing.

### Phase II: Coordination

After posting an invitation to a zoombombing, attackers coordinate the attack. We analyzed temporal information to understand when the attacks were planned.

**Crimes of Opportunity:**
- Most zoombombing targets online classes, which occur at regularly scheduled times. This raises questions about the level of premeditation.
- 115 of 123 bombing links on 4chan and 93 of 95 links on Twitter indicated that the meeting was live at the time of posting.
- Only 8 future links were found on 4chan and 2 on Twitter, suggesting that most attacks are opportunistic rather than premeditated.

**Refusal to Participate:**
- 20 threads on 4chan had users refusing to join the attack, citing ethical concerns or the NYPA (Not Your Personal Army) principle.
- Example:
  - "[ZOOMURL] please spam this online class"
  - "I’m not downloading shit"
  - "Nypa faggot"

### Phase III: Delivery

During this phase, attackers join the online meeting and begin their disruptive actions. We analyzed feedback within the bombing threads on 4chan to understand how the attacks unfolded.

**Quick Action:**
- 37 out of 123 bombing threads on 4chan had clear feedback related to the attack, often finishing within 20 minutes.
- Example:
  - 19:51:59 "Join a teacher’s Zoom [ZOOMURL]"
  - 20:05:18 "What the fuck is this? Who are these people?"
  - 20:07:43 "Quickly screencap it. They kicked me out instantly."

**Problem Feedback:**
- 24 threads reported issues with the zoombombing invitation.
- Example:
  - "Raid our school live call class, I believe in you faggots. [GOOGLEMEETLINK]"
  - "It says someone has to allow me to join, some shit like that"
  - "This meeting has been locked by the host. Sad!"

### Phase IV: Harm

Finally, we examined the toxic speech and actions during the attacks.

**Toxic Speech:**
- 14 zoombombing threads on 4chan contained toxic content, including racism, sexism, and hateful words.
- Example:
  - "[SKYPEURL] Anyone wanna join our online lesson? Our teacher is black. It’s gonna be in 20 mins."
  - "NIGGER." "That is absolutely a ‘he’, no matter how the swine identifies."
  - "What the fuck, I swear I spotted a beard on that chin."

**Crime Scene Feedback:**
- 15 threads on 4chan provided feedback on the zoombombing attacks, offering insights into the events.
- Example:
  - "Hard working he’s probably the kind of teacher who sits reverse on a chair and is up to date with the cool kids."
  - "HAHAHAHA that was great."
  - "Party’s over my dudes, IT is here shutting down the stream, we had a good laugh."
  - "Did you hear me saying nigger?"
  - "Anyone heard me farting."
  - "Yeah everyone heard and saw the chat and vc lmao."
  - "I didn’t hear that, maybe not loud enough but there was a bunch of rambling about the numbers on screen and then someone started farting and the class was just dying of laughter."
  - "Nice bro."
  - "Totally lmfao. Best class disruption ever."

### Discussion

Our data-driven analysis provides a deeper understanding of the zoombombing phenomenon, including the identities of the attackers and their methods. Here, we discuss the implications for existing mitigations and propose best practices to protect online meetings.

**Implications for Mitigation:**
- Current guidelines focus on preventing outsiders from accessing meeting links, such as using passwords and waiting rooms.
- However, our findings show that most attacks are initiated by insiders, making password protection less effective.
- A more effective approach might be to vet participants before allowing them into the meeting, although this increases the workload for hosts and moderators.

**Limitations and Future Work:**
- Our study has limitations, and further research is needed to develop more robust mitigation strategies.
- Future work could explore additional security measures and user education to prevent insider-initiated zoombombing attacks.
