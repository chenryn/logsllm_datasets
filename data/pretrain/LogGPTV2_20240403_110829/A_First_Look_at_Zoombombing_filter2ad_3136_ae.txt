next look for two indicators: 1) whether the language of the
call for the attack suggests it is called for by an insider and
2) whether whoever calls for an attack shares knowledge about
the meeting only an insider would have.
For the ﬁrst aspect, we look for language like “my lecture,”
“my colleague’s presentation,” “my company’s meeting,” etc.
58 zoombombing threads on 4chan and 19 zoombombing
tweets include language indicating the attack is called for by an
insider. In many cases, the users calling for the attack provide
additional information that only an insider would know. In 8
zoombombing threads and 8 zoombombing tweets, the attacker
asks others to use a certain name when joining the meeting to
avoid being identiﬁed as an intruder and removed.
“[GOOGLEMEETURL] name yourself [PARTIC-
IPANTSNAME] all caps or she wont let you in.”
“Also please use real-sounding names.”
In 11 threads we learn that the attacker is an insider from
their interaction with other users.
“Same school as you, different major. Someone
wrote "NIGGERS" in my zoom class with the
annotate function and started a zoom ﬁght.”
Together, with all information from both meeting links and
post text, we identify 86 out of 123 zoombombing threads on
4chan that appear to have been posted by insiders (38/54 for
Zoom, 35/46 for Google Meet, 8/10 for Cisco Webex, 3/3 for
Skype, 0/2 for GoToMeeting, 2/7 for Jitsi, and 0/1 Teams). For
Twitter, we ﬁnd that 78 out of the 95 zoombombing tweets
were posted by insiders.
Failed calls to attack. While 100 (out of 123) of our threads
did start with an invitation to bomb, 46 of these 100 threads
received no further replies. I.e., the call for an attack seems
to have been stillborn. For the threads with replies, 54 (out of
77) were started with an invitation to bomb and 23 (out of 77)
were created with more general topics of interest (e.g., politics,
COVID-19, etc.) which were later converted into bombing
threads. Threads with general topics tend to attract more posts
than bombing threads.
B. Phase II: Coordination
After posting an invite to a zoombombing, attackers coor-
dinate to carry it out. To better understand this, we look for
temporal information on when the attack should be carried out
in both 4chan threads and tweets.
Crimes of opportunity. Considering that most of the zoom-
bombing links target online classes, and that these occur at
regularly scheduled times, there is a question as to how much
premeditation goes into a bombing attack. On the surface, it
seems plausible that attacks could be planned days, and even
weeks in advance. To dig deeper, we looked at the text posted
along with a link and determined whether or not the invite was
for a live meeting, or one that was scheduled to take place in
the future. I.e., are attackers asking people to bomb right now

or planning a bombing that is going to happen later? We found
that 115 of 123 bombing links on 4chan and 93 of 95 links on
Twitter came along with a clear implication that the meeting
was live at the time of posting. We ﬁnd 8 future links among
123 links on 4chan and 2 out of 95 links on Twitter. A future
link example from 4chan is:
“RAID THIS BOOMER Wednesdays 10:00-10:45
[INSTITUTIONAL ZOOMURL]”
Refusing to participate. We ﬁnd 20 threads on 4chan where
users openly refuse to join into the attack, calling it unethical
or referring to the fact that 4chan users are not the insider’s
personal army (NYPA – Not Your Personal Army). This
indicates that not all users on 4chan are willing to participate
in these attacks, and is particularly interesting because it is a
possible explanation for at least some failed attacks: users do
not reply because they reject the idea of being a troll in the
service of another user.
“[ZOOMURL]please spam this online class”
“I’m not downloading shit”
“Nypa faggot”
C. Phase III: Delivery
In this phase, the attackers join the online meeting and begin
their harassing and disruptive actions. As part of our analysis,
we ﬁnd discussion of how the attacks went down in replies
within the bombing threads on 4chan.
Quick action. We compare the time interval between when
the link is posted and the ﬁrst feedback on the attack. Of 123
bombing threads on 4chan, we ﬁnd 37 with clear feedback
related to the bombing. According to this analysis, a zoom-
bombing attack often ﬁnishes within 20 minutes. An example
of attack feedback on 4chan is as follows:
19:51:59 “Join a teachers zoom [ZOOMURL]”
20:05:18 “What the fuck is this? Who are these
people?”
20:07:43 “quickly screencap it. They kicked me
out instantly.”
Problem feedback. For 24 threads we ﬁnd participants re-
porting problems with the zoombombing invitation.

“Raid our school live call class, i believe in you
faggots. [GOOGLEMEETLINK]”
“It says someone has to allow me to join, some
shit like that”
“this meeting has been locked by the host. Sad!”
D. Phase IV: Harm
Finally, we want to understand the toxic speech that happens
during attacks, together with what actions attackers carry out.
Toxic speech. We ﬁnd 14 4chan zoombombing threads con-
taining toxic content
including racism, sexism, or hateful
words.
“[SKYPEURL] Anyone wanna join our online
lesson? Our teacher is black. Its gonna be in 20
mins.”
“NIGGER.” “That is absolutely a ‘he’, no matter
how the swine identiﬁes.”
“What the fuck, I swear I spotted a beard on that
chin.”
On Twitter, we did not ﬁnd any toxic tweets among the 95
zoombombing tweets. However, recall that on Twitter we only
retrieve the call for attack and do not have any feedback (e.g.,
the replies to those tweets).
Crime scene feedback. On 4chan, we ﬁnd 15 threads con-
taining feedback from the zoombombing attack, providing us
with a better view of what happens during these attacks. Here
are some examples:
“Hard working he’s probably the kind of teacher
who sits reverse on a chair and is up to date with
the cool kids.”
“HAHAHAHA that was great.”
“Party’s over my dudes, IT is here shutting down
the stream, we had a good laugh.”
“Did you hear me saying nigger?”
“Ayone heard me farting.”
“Yeah everyone heard and saw the chat and vc
lmao.”
“I didn’t hear that, maybe not loud enough but
there was a bunch of rambling about the numbers
on screen and then someone started farting and the
class was just dying of laughter.”
“Nice bro.”
‘Totally lmfao. Best class disruption ever.”
VII. DISCUSSION
In this paper we presented a data-driven analysis of the
emerging phenomenon of zoombombing. Our ﬁndings im-
prove the understanding of who the people calling for zoom-
bombing attacks are and how they operate. In the following,
we ﬁrst discuss the implications of our ﬁndings to existing
mitigations against zoombombing, and propose some best
practices to protect online meeting rooms. We then discuss
the limitations of our study and some future work directions.
the same time, researchers,
Implications for zoombombing mitigation. After the rise
in popularity of online meeting tools, researchers have been
looking at the privacy risks linked to online meeting [26].
At
law enforcement, and the
online meeting providers themselves have been publishing best
practices to avoid zoombombing [6, 11, 55]. These include
not posting meeting links publicly, protecting meeting rooms
to control who can get in, and reducing the capabilities of
participants, like muting them upon joining as well as disabling
screen sharing and screen annotations.
The main assumption behind existing guidelines to prevent
zoombombing is that attackers will actively seek out meeting
links online, or that
they will bruteforce their ID. Given
this threat model, protecting meetings with passwords makes
sense. However, our ﬁndings show that most of the calls
for attacks that we observe come from insiders. This makes
password protection ineffective, because the insider will share
the password with the other attackers. Having participants
join a waiting room and vet them before letting them in
can be a more effective mitigation, although it
inevitably
increases the workload of meeting hosts, requiring moderators
