Assistant: This log chunk shows that four blocks (rdd_6_4, rdd_6_3, rdd_6_1, and rdd_6_2) were stored as bytes in memory, and four tasks (4.0, 3.0, 1.0, and 2.0) in stage 3.0 were completed and sent to the driver. Additionally, two tasks (0.0 and 1.0) in stage 4.0 were assigned and started running, and a broadcast variable (13) was started reading.
