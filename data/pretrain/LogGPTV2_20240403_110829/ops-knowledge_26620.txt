User: Please describe a common MySQL data table merging scenario and provide specific steps on how to do it.
Assistant: common MySQL data table merging scenario is merging two or more table data with the same structure into the same table, or merging data from one table into another. The specific steps are as follows: 1. Create the target table, including information such as table name, field name, data type, and length, and have the same structure as the data table to be merged. 2. Export the data in the data table that needs to be merged as a CSV or SQL file to ensure that the file format is correct. 3. To import the exported data file into the target table, you can use the LOAD DATA command that comes with MySQL. The syntax is as follows: LOAD DATA [LOW_PRIORITY | CONCURRENT] [LOCAL] INFILE 'file_name' [REPLACE | IGNORE] INTO TABLE table_name [CHARACTER SET charset_name] [field delimiter, encoding, etc] 4. When performing step 3, you need to pay attention to parameter settings, such as selecting an appropriate character set, field delimiter, and adaptive line break. 5. After performing step 3, you can query and check the target table to confirm whether the data is merged correctly. 6. If necessary, operations such as deduplication, sorting, and filtering can be performed on the data in the target table to meet specific needs. 7. Finally, you can delete the original data table, or keep it for backup and debugging purposes.
