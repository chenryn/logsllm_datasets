### Summary and Analysis of User Responses to CodeShield

**Introduction:**
Participants were informed about the A/V product and had to enter installation mode for updates. The next highest in the reboot group was 11.

**User Feedback:**
The overall response to CodeShield was positive. On a scale of 1-10 (1 being Strongly Disagree, 5 being Neutral, and 10 being Strongly Agree), both groups rated their system as usable. The mean usability score for the reboot group was 7.26, and for the switch group, it was 8. Participants were generally neutral about continuing to use CodeShield, with responses close to Neutral. Notably, 7 out of 35 users (20%) continued to use CodeShield at least three months after the study concluded.

**Understanding and Acceptance:**
One of CodeShield's goals was to create a security mechanism that aligns with users' mental models. This is because if users understand what they are doing, they are less likely to make dangerous mistakes. Although our study did not fully address this, the average response to "I understand the design rationale of CodeShield" was around 8-8.5, indicating a general understanding and acceptance of the model presented by CodeShield.

**Survey Results:**
For all survey questions, the responses were generally positive, with the switch group providing slightly more positive feedback than the reboot group. We attribute this difference to the overhead of entering installation mode for the reboot group. However, due to the sample size, there were no statistically significant results.

**Installation Mode Usage:**
An interesting observation was that the reboot group entered installation mode significantly fewer times than the switch group. The average number of entries into installation mode for the reboot group was 5.25, while for the switch group, it was 16.66. The median values (less affected by outliers) were 3.5 for the reboot group and 17 for the switch group. Approximately 20% of installation mode entries were unnecessary, as they saw no programs added to the whitelist.

**Behavioral Differences:**
Despite the large difference in the frequency of entering installation mode, the gap in the degree of acceptance of CodeShield between the two groups was smaller. The reboot group's average scores on satisfaction questions were slightly lower but close to those of the switch group. We interpret this to mean that many entries into installation mode for the switch group were unnecessary, as the system would function fine without them. Users in the switch group were more likely to enter installation mode due to the ease of switching, while the inconvenience for the reboot group may have led to some dissatisfaction with CodeShield.

**Conclusion:**
These results confirm our hypothesis that a certain level of inconvenience for entering installation mode is both necessary and beneficial. However, we should refine CodeShield to reduce the need for users to enter installation mode, such as avoiding repeated notifications when multiple DLLs are blocked for the same process.

**Trusted Certificates:**
The mean number of trusted certificates on each machine was 77, indicating that many software vendors are signing their code. Across all 35 machines, 798 unique certificates were identified, with 345 appearing on two or more machines and 453 appearing on a single machine. This highlights the diversity of installed software and supports the advantage of a personalized application whitelisting approach over a global one.

**Reboot Frequency:**
The study also recorded the number of reboots during the 42-day period. The reboot group averaged around 44 reboots, while the switch group surprisingly had an average of 65 reboots (with a higher standard deviation). This finding suggests that the additional reboots required by CodeShield could be acceptable, as the high reboot count indicates that most people frequently restart their systems.

**Conclusion and Future Work:**
We have demonstrated that CodeShield is a practical system for non-technical users to protect themselves from various threats. It detects and marks new data, blocks new content execution unless it is whitelisted, and provides a more intuitive model for users to understand their actions. Our user study suggests that installation events are infrequent, justifying the additional effort for a more secure system. CodeShield can prevent critical attacks, including drive-by downloads, malicious documents, and social engineering attacks.
