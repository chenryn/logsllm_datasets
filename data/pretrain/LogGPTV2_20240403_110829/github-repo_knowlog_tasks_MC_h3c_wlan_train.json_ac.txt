   - 优化后：`Memory usage has fallen below the [STRING] threshold.`

7. **OpenFlow实例修改组失败**：
   - 原文：`Openflow instance [UINT16] controller [CHAR] failed to modify group [STRING].`
   - 优化后：`OpenFlow instance [UINT16] controller [CHAR] failed to modify group [STRING].`

8. **聚合组成员端口状态变化**：
   - 原文：`Member port [STRING] of aggregation group [STRING] changed to the inactive state, because the physical state of the port is down.`
   - 优化后：`Member port [STRING] of the aggregation group [STRING] has transitioned to an inactive state due to the port's physical state being down.`

9. **NAT配置激活失败**：
   - 原文：`Failed to activate NAT configuration on interface [STRING], because global IP addresses already bound to another service card.`
   - 优化后：`Activation of the NAT configuration on interface [STRING] failed because the global IP addresses are already bound to another service card.`

10. **用户登录记录**：
    - 原文：`[STRING] logged in from [STRING].`
    - 优化后：`User [STRING] logged in from [STRING].`

11. **SSH连接成功**：
    - 原文：`SSH user [STRING] (IP [STRING]) connected to the server successfully.`
    - 优化后：`SSH user [STRING] (IP [STRING]) successfully connected to the server.`

12. **删除服务器方案失败**：
    - 原文：`Failed to delete servers in scheme [STRING].`
    - 优化后：`Deletion of servers in scheme [STRING] failed.`

13. **BSS数量超过上限**：
    - 原文：`-APID=[STRING]-RadioID=[STRING]-WLANID=[STRING]-ST Name=[STRING]; The number of BSSs exceeded the upper limit.`
    - 优化后：`- APID=[STRING], RadioID=[STRING], WLANID=[STRING], ST Name=[STRING]: The number of BSSs has exceeded the upper limit.`

14. **TRILL功能禁用**：
    - 原文：`The TRILL feature is being disabled, because its license has expired.`
    - 优化后：`The TRILL feature is being disabled due to an expired license.`

15. **MAC地址表项超限**：
    - 原文：`The number of MAC address entries exceeded the maximum number [UINT32] in VLAN [UINT32].`
    - 优化后：`The number of MAC address entries in VLAN [UINT32] has exceeded the maximum allowed [UINT32].`

16. **DHCP包过滤规则应用失败**：
    - 原文：`Failed to apply filtering rules for DHCP packets because some rules are not supported.`
    - 优化后：`Application of filtering rules for DHCP packets failed because some rules are not supported.`

17. **PVST BPDU保护触发**：
    - 原文：`PVST BPDUs were received on port [STRING], which is enabled with PVST BPDU protection.`
    - 优化后：`PVST BPDUs were received on port [STRING], which has PVST BPDU protection enabled.`

通过这些优化，文本变得更加清晰、连贯和专业。
