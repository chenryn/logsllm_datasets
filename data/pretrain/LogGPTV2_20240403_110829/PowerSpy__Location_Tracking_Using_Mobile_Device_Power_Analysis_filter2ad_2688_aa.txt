Abstract
Modern mobile platforms like Android enable applica-
tions to read aggregate power usage on the phone. This
information is considered harmless and reading it re-
quires no user permission or notiﬁcation. We show that
by simply reading the phone’s aggregate power con-
sumption over a period of a few minutes an application
can learn information about the user’s location. Aggre-
gate phone power consumption data is extremely noisy
due to the multitude of components and applications that
simultaneously consume power. Nevertheless, by using
machine learning algorithms we are able to successfully
infer the phone’s location. We discuss several ways in
which this privacy leak can be remedied.

Introduction
Our phones are always within reach and their location is
mostly the same as our location. In effect, tracking the
location of a phone is practically the same as tracking the
location of its owner. Since users generally prefer that
their location not be tracked by arbitrary 3rd parties, all
mobile platforms consider the device’s location as sensi-
tive information and go to considerable lengths to protect
it: applications need explicit user permission to access
the phone’s GPS and even reading coarse location data
based on cellular and WiFi connectivity requires explicit
user permission.
In this work we show that despite these restrictions ap-
plications can covertly learn the phone’s location. They
can do so using a seemingly benign sensor: the phone’s
power meter that measures the phone’s power consump-
tion over a period of time. Our work is based on the ob-
servation that the phone’s location signiﬁcantly affects
the power consumed by the phone’s cellular radio. The
power consumption is affected both by the distance to
the cellular base station to which the phone is currently
attached (free-space path loss) and by obstacles, such
as buildings and trees, between them (shadowing). The
closer the phone is to the base station and the fewer ob-
stacles between them the less power the phone consumes.
The strength of the cellular signal is a major factor affect-
ing the power used by the cellular radio [29]. Moreover,
the cellular radio is one of the most dominant power con-
sumers on the phone [14].
Suppose an attacker measures in advance the power
proﬁle consumed by a phone as it moves along a set of
known routes or in a predetermined area such as a city.
We show that this enables the attacker to infer the tar-
get phone’s location over those routes or areas by simply
analyzing the target phone’s power consumption over a
period of time. This can be done with no knowledge of
the base stations to which the phone is attached.
A major technical challenge is that power is consumed
simultaneously by many components and applications on
the phone in addition to the cellular radio. A user may
launch applications, listen to music, turn the screen on
and off, receive a phone call, and so on. All these activ-
ities affect the phone’s power consumption and result in
a very noisy approximation of the cellular radio’s power
usage. Moreover, the cellular radio’s power consumption
itself depends on the phone’s activity, as well as the dis-
tance to the base-station: during a voice call or data trans-
mission the cellular radio consumes more power than
when it is idle. All of these factors contribute to the
phone’s power consumption variability and add noise to
the attacker’s view: the power meter only provides ag-
gregate power usage and cannot be used to measure the
power used by an individual component such as the cel-
lular radio.
Nevertheless, using machine learning, we show that
the phone’s aggregate power consumption over time
completely reveals the phone’s location and movement.
Intuitively, the reason why all this noise does not mislead
our algorithms is that the noise is not correlated with the
phone’s location. Therefore, a sufﬁciently long power
measurement (several minutes) enables the learning al-
gorithm to “see” through the noise. We refer to power
consumption measurements as time-series and use meth-
ods for comparing time-series to obtain classiﬁcation and
pattern matching algorithms for power consumption pro-
ﬁles.
In this work we use machine learning to identify the

routes taken by the victim based on previously collected
power consumption data. We study three types of user
tracking goals:
1. Route distinguishability: First, we ask whether an
attacker can tell what route the user is taking among
a ﬁxed set of possible routes.
2. Real-time motion tracking: Assuming the user is
taking a certain known route, we ask whether an at-
tacker can identify her location along the route and
track the device’s position on the route in real-time.
3. New route inference: Finally, suppose a user is
moving along an arbitrary (long) route. We ask if
an attacker can learn the user’s route using the previ-
ously measured power proﬁle of many (short) road
segments in that area. The attacker composes the
power proﬁle of the short road segments to identify
the user’s route and location at the end of the route.
We emphasize that our approach is based on measuring
the phone’s aggregate power consumption and nothing
else.
In particular, we do not use the phone’s signal
strength as this data is protected on Android and iOS de-
vices and reading it requires user permission. In contrast,
reading the phone’s power meter requires no special per-
missions.
On Android reading the phone’s aggregate power me-
ter is done by repeatedly reading the following two ﬁles:
/sys/class/power supply/battery/voltage now
/sys/class/power supply/battery/current now
Over a hundred applications in the Play Store access
these ﬁles. While most of these simply monitor battery
usage, our work shows that all of them can also easily
track the user’s location.
Our contributions. Our work makes the following con-
tributions:
• We show that the power meter available on modern
phones can reveal potentially private information.
• We develop the machine learning techniques needed
to use data collected from the power meter to infer
location information. The technical details of our
algorithms are presented in sections 4, 5 and 6, fol-
lowed by experimental results.
• In sections 8 and 9 we discuss potential continuation
to this work, as well as defenses to prevent this type
of information leakage.
2 Threat Models
We assume a malicious application is installed on the vic-
tim’s device and runs in the background. The application
has no permission to access the GPS or any other loca-
tion data such as the cellular or WiFi components.
In
particular, the application has no permission to query the
identity of visible cellular base stations or the SSID of
visible WiFi networks.
We only assume access to power data (which requires
no special permissions on Android) and permission to
communicate with a remote server. Network connectiv-
ity is needed to generate dummy low rate trafﬁc to pre-
vent the cellular radio from going into low power state.
In our setup we also use network connectivity to send
data to a central server for processing. However, it may
be possible to do all processing on the phone.1
As noted earlier, the application can only read the ag-
gregate power consumed by the phone. It cannot mea-
sure the power consumed by the cellular radio alone.
This presents a signiﬁcant challenge since many compo-
nents on the phone consume variable amounts of power
at any given time. Consequently, all the measurements
are extremely noisy and we need a way to “see” though
the noise.
To locate the phone, we assume the attacker has prior
knowledge of the area or routes through which the victim
is traveling. This knowledge allows the attacker to mea-
sure the power consumption proﬁle of different routes in
that area in advance. Our system correlates this data with
the phone’s measured power usage and we show that, de-
spite the noisy measurements, we are able to correctly lo-
cate the phone. Alternatively, as for many other machine
learning cases, the training data can also be collected af-
ter obtaining the unlabeled query data. For instance, an
attacker obtained a power consumption proﬁle of a user,
the past location of whom it is extremely important to
determine. She can still collect, after the fact, reference
proﬁles for a limited area in which the user has likely
been driving and carry out the attack.
For this to work we need the tracked phone to be mov-
ing by a car or a bus while being tracked. Our system
cannot locate a phone that is standing still since that only
provides the power proﬁle for a single location. We need
multiple adjacent locations for the attack to work.
Given the resources at our disposal, the focus of this
work is on locating a phone among a set of local routes in
a pre-determined area. A larger effort is needed to scale
the system to cover the entire world by pre-measuring the
power proﬁle of all road segments worldwide. Neverthe-
less, our localized experiments already show that track-
ing users who follow a daily routine is quite possible. For
example, a mobile device owner might choose one of a
small number of routes to get from home to work. The

system correctly identiﬁes what route was chosen and in
real-time identiﬁes where the phone is along that route.
This already serves as a cautionary note about the type of
information that can be leaked by a seemingly innocuous
sensor like the power meter.
We note that scaling the system to cover worldwide
road segments can be done by crowd-sourcing: a popular
app, or perhaps even the core OS, can record the power
proﬁle of streets traveled by different users and report
the results to a central server. Over time the resulting
dataset will cover a signiﬁcant fraction of the world. On
the positive side, our work shows that service providers
can legitimately use this dataset to improve the accuracy
of location services. On the negative side, tracking apps
can use it to covertly locate users. Given that all that is
required is one widespread application, many actors in
the mobile space are in a position to build the required
dataset of power proﬁles and use it as they will.
3 Background
In this section we provide technical background on the
relation between a phone’s location and its cellular power
consumption. We start with a description of how loca-
tion is related to signal strength, then we describe how
signal strength is related to power consumption. Fi-
nally, we present examples of this phenomenon, and we
demonstrate how obtaining access to power measure-
ments could leak information about a phone’s location.
3.1 Location affects signal strength and
power consumption
Distance to the base station is the primary factor that de-
termines a phone’s signal strength. The reason for this is,
for signals propagating in free space, the signal’s power
loss is proportional to the square of the distance it travels
over [11]. Signal strength is not only determined by path
loss, it is also affected by objects in the signal path, such
as trees and buildings, that attenuate the signal. Finally,
signal strength also depends on multi-path interference
caused by objects that reﬂect the radio signal back to the
phone through various paths having different lengths.
In wireless communication theory signal strength is
often modeled as random variation (e.g.,
log-normal
shadowing [11]) to simulate many different environ-
ments2. However, in one location signal strength can be
fairly consistent as base stations, attenuators, and reﬂec-
tors are mostly stationary.
A phone’s received signal strength to its base sta-
tion affects its cellular modem power consumption.
2Parameters of the model can be calibrated to better match a speciﬁc
environment of interest.
Namely, phone cellular modems consume less instanta-
neous power when transmitting and receiving at high sig-
nal strength compared to low signal strength. Schulman
et. al. [29] observed this phenomenon on several differ-
ent cellular devices operating on different cellular proto-
cols. They showed that communication at a poor signal
location can result in a device power draw that is 50%
higher than at a good signal location.
The primary reason for this phenomenon is the
phone’s power ampliﬁer used for transmission which in-
creases its gain as signal strength drops [11]. This effect
also occurs when a phone is only receiving packets. The
reason for this is cellular protocols which require con-
stant transmission of channel quality and acknowledg-
ments to base stations.
3.2 Power usage can reveal location
The following results from driving experiments demon-
strate the potential of leaking location from power mea-
surements.
We ﬁrst demonstrate that signal strength in each loca-
tion on a drive can be static over the course of several
days. We collected signal strength measurements from
a smartphone once, and again several days later. In Fig-
ure 1 we plot the signal strength observed on these two
drives. In this ﬁgure it is apparent that (1) the segments
of the drive where signal strength is high (green) and low
(red) are in the same locations across both days, and (2)
that the progression of signal strength along the drive ap-
pears to be a unique irregular pattern.
Next, we demonstrate that just like signal strength,
power measurements of a smartphone, while it commu-
nicates, can reveal a stable, unique pattern for a partic-
ular drive. Unlike signal strength, power measurements
are less likely to be stable across drives because power
depends on how the cellular modem reacts to changing
signal strength: a small difference in signal strength be-
tween two drives may put the cellular modem in a mode
that has a large difference in power consumption. For ex-
ample, a small difference in signal strength may cause a
phone to hand-off to a different cellular base station and
stay attached to it for some time (Section 3.3).
Figure 2 shows power measurements for two Nexus 4
phones in the same vehicle, transmitting packets over
their cellular link, while driving on the same path. The
power consumption variations of the Nexus 4 phones
are similar, indicating that power measurements can be
mostly stable across devices.
Finally, we demonstrate that power measurements
could be stable across different models of smartphones.
This stability would allow an attacker to obtain a ref-
erence power measurement for a drive without using
the same phone as the victim’s. We recorded power
