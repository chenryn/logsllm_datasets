User:  How to configure the Nginx reverse proxy server to forward requests from the outside to the application server in the internal network?
Assistant: To configure the Nginx reverse proxy server to forward requests to the internal application server, you can follow the steps below: 1. Install Nginx and start the service. 2. Configure the reverse proxy settings of Nginx. You can add the following content to the nginx.conf file: ``` http { upstream app_servers { server 192.168.1.100:8080; server 192.168.1.101:8080; } server { listen 80; location / { proxy_pass http://app_servers; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; } } } ``` Among them, the upstream configuration item specifies the address and port number of the internal application server, and the server configuration item specifies the port number that Nginx monitors, and forwards the request to the internal application server. The proxy_set_header configuration item is used to set HTTP header information so that the internal application server can correctly process the request. 3. Restart the Nginx service to make the configuration take effect. 4. Test whether the Nginx reverse proxy is working properly. You can use the curl command or a browser to access the IP address of the Nginx server to check whether the request is correctly forwarded to the internal application server.
