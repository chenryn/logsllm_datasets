### Bug summary
I use the `rect` parameter of the figure's layout engine to set figure
margins. For figures with `layout='constrained'` this parameter appears to be
ignored if `rcParams['figure.constrained_layout.use']` is `True` when saving
the figure.
### Code for reproduction
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.rcParams['figure.constrained_layout.use']=True
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    engine = fig.get_layout_engine()
    engine.set(rect=[0.1,0.1,0.8,0.8]) # (left, bottom, width, height)
    engine.execute(fig)
    fig.savefig('test-constrained-True.png')
### Actual outcome
The saved figure does not have the expected layout. It does not match the
figure displayed interactively. The axes extend to the edges of the figure
area.

### Expected outcome
The saved figure has matches what is shown interactively. The axes do not
extend to the edges of the figure area, respecting the `rect` parameter. This
saved figure is generated with the code, which does not demonstrate the bug:
    plt.rcParams['figure.constrained_layout.use'] = False
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(layout='constrained')
    engine = fig.get_layout_engine()
    engine.set(rect=[0.1,0.1,0.8,0.8]) # (left, bottom, width, height)
    engine.execute(fig)
    fig.savefig('test-constrained-False.png')
