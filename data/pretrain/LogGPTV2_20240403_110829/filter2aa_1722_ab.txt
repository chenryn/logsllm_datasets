Analyst must also make similar distinctions when considering the parties involved when 
a cyber act occurs.  State actors, terrorist groups, criminals, or various other internet miscreants 
are all capable of conducting cyber attacks.32  When one considers the notion of war, a conflict 
involving two or more nation states immediately comes to mind.  A war, however, can also 
consist of a nation state and a non-state actor since “customary international law has evolved to 
allow states to apply the law of self-defense to non-state actors.”33  Such was the case when the 
UN Security Council passed UNSCR 1368, in support of OPERATION ENDURING 
FREEDOM, a day after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center 
(“9/11”).  This resolution explicitly recognized the United States‟ inherent right of individual or 
collective self-defense pursuant to Article 51 of the UN Charter against the terrorist actors who 
perpetrated the 9/11 attacks.34  The author, therefore, and for the purposes of this paper, is 
considering two conflict scenarios: a nation state against another nation state; and a nation state 
against a non-state actor.  Both of these scenarios can be addressed under the UN Charter.35  A 
cyber act that is criminal in nature is outside the scope of this paper, and would be addressed 
under appropriate international criminal laws; as is two non-state actors involved in a cyber 
conflict.  Thus, this paper is not concerned with international cyber crimes such as internet 
scams.  In addition, a scenario such as a private Chinese hacking group attacking the website of a 
private Russian hacking group is also outside the scope of this paper.  Indeed, as it relates to 
cyber warfare, attribution is one of the biggest challenges, and one can imagine a situation where 
a nation conducts cyber activities under the guise of private independent hacking groups, or even 
while appearing to be another nation state.  Although attribution is a significant challenge, the

author considers attribution to be a separate and unique issue, independent of whether the rules 
of war are adequate for addressing cyber warfare.    
III.  A Brief Overview of Cyber Warfare’s Current Legal Framework 
The two main questions facing military operations in cyberspace are: (1) which interstate 
activities in cyberspace constitute a threat or use of force under international law; and (2) when 
such a threat or use of force does constitute an armed attack under international law, how does 
that law of armed conflict apply to the lawful exercise of the inherent right of self-defense in 
cyberspace.36  This section is, therefore, organized according to the following two regimes: Pre-
Hostilities Law and Post-Hostilities Law; both in the context of CNAs. 
A. Pre-Hostilities Law (Jus ad Bellum): There is a general prohibition against all uses 
of force, except those sanctioned by the UN Security Council or done in self-defense. 
Jus ad bellum (“Right to wage war”) has its foundations in the United Nations (“UN”) 
Charter.  The UN Charter mandates a general prohibition against the use of force, stating in 
article 2(4) that “[a]ll members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use 
of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or any other 
manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”37  Commentators interpret Article 
2(4) in two distinct ways.  First, a minority of commentators interpret Article 2(4) as banning 
only the use of force directed at the territorial integrity or political independence of a state.  
Second, the majority of commentators believe that the minority‟s emphasis on territorial integrity 
and political independence are merely intensifiers, and that the article constitutes a general

CYBERSPACE 10 (Naval Postgraduate School) (explaining that two important legal issues related to cyber warfare are

warfare) (2004); see also JEFFREY CARR, INSIDE CYBER WARFARE 31-43 (Mike Loukides ed., O‟Reilly Media 2010) 
(2009). 
37 U.N. CHARTER art. 2, para 4. 
prohibition against all uses of forces, subject only to the exceptions stated in the UN Charter.  
The majority‟s interpretation is supported by the “or any other manner” language in Article 2(4), 
in that it can be argued that virtually any other use of force, not authorized by the Charter, is 
prohibited.38  The majority‟s interpretation is also supported by the historic context in which the 
Charter was drafted; the preamble specifically states that "to save succeeding generations from 
the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind" is a 
principal aim of the UN Charter.  The majority‟s view is now considered to be a part of 
customary international law, which, therefore, bans the use of armed force except for two 
situations authorized by the UN Charter.   
First, Chapter VII, entitled “Action With Respect to Threats to the Peace, Breaches of the 
Peace, and Acts of Aggression,” gives the UN Security Council the authority to "determine the 
existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression" and to take 
military and nonmilitary action to "restore international peace and security.”  In this case, and 
pursuant to Article 39, the Security Council must first determine whether a threat to peace, a 
breach of peace or an act of aggression exists.  Based upon this determination, the Security 
Council then has the power under Article 41 to employ measures short of force, including a wide 
variety of diplomatic and economic sanctions against the target State, to compel compliance with 
its decisions.  Should those measures prove inadequate, the Security Council has the power to 
authorize member States to employ military force in accordance with Article 42.  
38 Id. 
Second, Article 51 of the UN Charter provides for the right of countries to engage in 
military action in self-defense, including collective self-defense.39  Article 51 of the Charter 
provides: 
Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or 
collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United 
Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain 
international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of 
this right of self-defense shall be immediately reported to the Security Council 
and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security 
Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems 
necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security. 
The inherent right of self-defense has been manifested in three recurring areas: (1) protection of 
nationals and their property located abroad; (2) protection of a nation‟s political independence; 
and (3) protection of a nation‟s territorial integrity.  In all acts of self-defense, the UN Charter 
requires the act to be necessary,40 proportional,41 and timely.42  Thus, a government, pursuant to 
its right of self-defense, may conceivably respond to a distributed denial of service (DDoS) 
attack,43 with a computer attack of its own.  Here, the aggrieved government would be justified 
39 See INTERNATIONAL AND OPERATIONAL LAW DEPARTMENT, OPERATIONAL LAW HANDBOOK 1-3 (Marie 
Anderson & Emily Zukauskas eds., The Judge Advocate General‟s Legal Center & School, U.S. Army)(2008). 
40 Here, one must consider the exhaustion or ineffectiveness of peaceful means of resolution, the nature of coercion 
applied by the aggressor State, objectives of each party, and the likelihood of effective community intervention. 
41 Here, the actor must limit force in magnitude, scope, and duration to that which is reasonably necessary to counter 
a threat or attack. 
42 A delay of a response to an attack or threat of attack attenuates the immediacy of the threat and the necessity to 
use force in self-defense. 
43 A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack  is one in which a multitude of compromised systems attack a single 
target, thereby causing denial of service for users of the targeted system.  The flood of incoming messages to the 
target system essentially forces it to shut down, thereby denying service to legitimate users. WEBOPEDIA 
http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/DDoS_attack.html. 
in attacking the computer systems where the DDoS originated (the “originating computers”).44  
Thus, the aggrieved government would have shown that its act of self-defense was: (1) 
“necessary” to prevent the originating computers from attacking it again; (2) “proportional” 
because it essentially responded in kind with a computer attack of its own; and (3) timely 
because the act of self-defense was done in a reasonable time following the original attack. 
B. Post-Hostilities Law (Jus in Bello): When deciding if a target can be attacked, a 
combatant commander must consider distinction; balancing military necessity with 
humanity; and proportionality 
Once two nations are in armed conflict with each other, the law of war applies.45  The 
Department of Defense (DoD) mandates the law of war to apply in all operations including 
military operations other than war (emphasis added).46  Thus, combatant commanders must 
adhere to the law of war during Cyber operations.47  
Commanders may only attack lawful military targets.  Lawful military targets are 
“combatants and those objects, which, by their nature, location, purpose, or use, effectively 
contribute to the enemy‟s war-fighting or war-sustaining capability and whose total or partial 
destruction, capture, or neutralization would constitute a definite military advantage to the 
attacker under the circumstances at the time of the attack.”48  “[T]argets of the enemy that 
indirectly but effectively support and sustain the enemy‟s war-fighting capability may also be 
44 Here, the problem of attribution arises again. Although difficult, there are methods for locating the originator of a 
DDoS attack.  See e.g. IHAB HAMADEH, ATTACK ATTRIBUTION FOR DISTRIBUTED DENIAL-OF-SERVICE AND WORM 
ATTACKS (Pennsylvania State University 2006) (2006). 
45 See Condition (I) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field,

attacked.”49  A combatant commander must consider three factors when deciding if a target can 
be attacked:   
(1) Distinction 
(2) Balancing Military Necessity with Humanity 
(3) Proportionality50 
1. Distinction 
Two concepts emerge under the principle of distinction:  (1) that there be a formal 
distinction between combatant and noncombatant persons;51 and (2) the duty to conduct warfare 
in a manner that minimizes harm to civilians and other noncombatants.  Because this paper is 
primarily concerned with the act and not the actor of cyber warfare, an emphasis is placed on the 
latter concept of distinction.  However, as a note, lawful combatants include the uniformed 
regular armed forces of a state, who have the sole right to participate in armed attacks or 
hostilities against an enemy.52   
A combatant commander is required to distinguish between military and civilian objects, 
as the central idea of distinction is that only valid military targets should be attacked.  Protocol 
Additional to the Geneva Conventions53 covers distinction in this respect.  The general rule for 
distinction is embodied in Article 48, which states that “[i]n order to ensure respect for and 
protection of the civilian population and civilian objects, the Parties to the conflict shall at all 
times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects

and military objectives and accordingly shall direct their operations only against military 
objectives.”  Article 50 defines who is a civilian and what is a civilian population.  Article 51 
describes the protection that should be given to civilian populations.  Article 52 regulates the 
targeting of civilian objects.  Article 57 outlines specific steps that a commander must take in 
order to verify that and object is not civilian in nature.     
Drawing the line of distinction is not easy.  Complicating the matter for commanders, 
civilian objects can temporarily become valid military objectives based on location, purpose, or 
use.54  Major Eric Talbot Jensen, a Professor in The International and Operational Law 
Department at The U.S. Army‟s Judge Advocate General School, explained the concept of dual 
use objects using an infamous bridge example: 
[A] bridge that normally carries civilian traffic and would be considered a civilian object 
would become a military objective based on its location if it became the means for the 
enemy's armed forces to move to the battle. While still serving as a primary means for 
civilian transport over the river, the bridge is now a military object, as it is the primary 
means for the military to cross that same river. Objects like this are known as dual-use 
objects; objects that simultaneously serve civilian and military objectives. These dual-use 
objects present a unique challenge for commanders.55 
It is important to note that even when engaging a dual-use object found to be a military 
objective, the commander, when possible, must make an effort to limit his attack to the portions 
54 See GPI, supra note 21, art. 57, para. 2(a)(ii), 1125 U.N.T.S. at 29.

Network Operations?, 18 AM. U. INT'L L. REV. 1145, 1156-57 (2003). 
of the dual-use object that is military in nature. Furthermore, once the dual-use object ceases to 
support military objectives, it must be looked upon as being civilian in nature.56    
Distinction comes into play in attacks upon an enemy‟s computer network.  Because of 
the interconnective nature of the internet, that network would likely be dual use, as civilian 
internet service providers enable online networks, while supporting the enemy‟s military 
objective of communicating.  As discussed above, a combatant commander would need to take 
reasonable steps to limit the attack to the portion of the network used by the enemy.  If the 
combatant commander releases a computer virus that propagates randomly through networks on 
which essential civilian functions reside, such as banking, medical care or electrical power, then 
the principle of distinction would likely be violated. 
2. Balancing Military Necessity with Humanity 
In addition to distinction, the combatant commander will have to balance military 
necessity with humanitarian principles.  Under military necessity, an attack on a particular target 
must further a legitimate military objective or confer a definite military advantage.57  Although 
the principle of military necessity appears to be a liberal one, it is not unchecked.  It must be 
balanced against the principle of humanity.58  That is, an attack should not cause unnecessary 
suffering or superfluous injury in order to accomplish a military purpose.59
