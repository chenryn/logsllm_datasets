The explanation says
If the length of the string is less than or equal to 3 characters, then the
length of the three dots is not added to the string length.
truncate("A-", 1) should return "A...".
While the original string is less then 3 character, the outcome is less than 3
characters, still the result should be A.... Seems not really logical to me.
