Strengthen network security: Use network firewalls, intrusion detection systems, anti-virus software and other security protection equipment and software to monitor and alert the system in real time. 2. Strengthen password management: Require users to use strong passwords and change passwords regularly, and at the same time strengthen the protection of password encryption, storage, transmission and verification. 3. Install system patches: Operating systems, databases, applications, etc. must be installed and updated with security patches, and upgrade the system or application software in time to ensure that vulnerabilities can be repaired in a timely manner. 4. Data backup and recovery: regularly back up key data, and require the backup data to be protected in terms of deep encryption, storage, transmission, and verification, so as to ensure that the data can be quickly restored when the data encounters a virus, hacker attack, etc. recover. 5. Strengthen employees' safety awareness: the company should establish a sound safety system and rules and regulations, organize activities such as safety skill training, knowledge dissemination, and safety drills to improve employees' safety awareness and enhance the company's collective safety awareness. 6. Restrict access rights: Control system access rights to ensure that internal personnel of the company can only access sensitive information that needs to be used, and at the same time control rights and authenticate access for external users. 7.
