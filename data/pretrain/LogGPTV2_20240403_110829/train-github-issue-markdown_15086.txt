I'm using a large dataset which takes up most of my memory. `cross_val_score`
is basically unable to run on it (I get a `MemoryError`) since AFAICT data is
duplicated for each fold (with `list()` here):  
scikit-learn/sklearn/model_selection/_validation.py
Line 131 in 38f6a91
|  cv_iter = list(cv.split(X, y, groups))  
---|---  
Would it be possible to use views or otherwise avoid this duplication?
