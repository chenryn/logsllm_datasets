5.2.2.2 Resisting concentrated attacks 
Figure 12 shows of the usersí experienced performance
using 
in
concentrated  attacks.    The  attack  load  is  concentrated
on a random subset of edge proxies.  In this case, attack 
traffic  saturates  part  of  the  proxy  network,  and  a 
significant  percentage  of users  are  affected  due  to 
congestion  and  packet  loss.    This  effect  is  more

We repeat the experiments for concentrated attacks, and 
let users switch to the closest proxy not being saturated
(dynamic  edge  proxy  selection).   Figure  13 shows  the 
CDF  of  user-observed  performance.    Compared  with
Figure  12,  the  performance  has  been  significantly
improved.    For  comparison,  Figure  13  also plots  the
baseline  case  where  users  directly  access 
the 
application  without  attack  traffic.    It  shows  that,  for 
most  users,  the  proxy  network  can  maintain  a  slightly
better performance than the baseline case, even under a
high  attack  load  (e.g.  6.0Gbps).    Therefore,  proxy 
networks can resist concentrated attacks effectively. 
To understand the performance gap between the attack 
cases  and  the non-attack  case,  we  measure  the  usersí
experienced  performance  without  attack  (for  the  R1K
network),  while  using  the  set  of  edge proxies  they 
switch  to  during  attacks  (shown  in  Figure  14).    For 
most users, this curve follows the attack cases closely, 
showing  that  the  performance  gap  is  due  to  switching
edge  proxies  rather  than  congestion  caused  by  attack 
traffic. Additionally,  a  small  number  of  users  are
greatly  affected by  the  attack,  due  to  the  limitation  of 
the underlying network discussed in Figure 11.

Figure 14 Analysis of Dynamic Edge Selection 
5.2.3 Scalability of resilience 
We  explore  how  varying  the  size  (width)  of  a  proxy
network  affects  its  resilience  to  attacks.    This  is  an 
important  scaling  property,  showing how effective  we
can  resist  a  larger scale  of  attacks  by  building  larger 
proxy networks.   
The goal of our experiment is to evaluate the amount of
attack load proxy networks can withstand for a range of 
proxy network widths.  It is difficult to directly measure
the  maximum  attack  load  that  a  proxy  network  can 
tolerate.    Instead,  we  set  the  attack  magnitude  to be
95% of the proxy networkís capacity, and measure the
user-observed performance.  We define the capacity of
a proxy network to be the sum of the link capacity of its
edge proxies. For example, if the proxy network has 16
edge proxies and  each  edge  proxy has  a  100  Mbps
uplink, then its capacity is 1.6Gbps and the aggregated 
attack  magnitude  is  1.52Gbps.    Note  that  the  capacity 
defined  here  describes  the  maximum  attack  load  a
proxy network can possibly resist (the load to saturate
all the edges), rather than the maximum throughput of 
application traffic a proxy network can deliver. 
Proxy network scaling results are shown in Figure 15.
The X-axis is the number of edge proxies in the proxy
network (they all have height 3); the Y-axis is the user-
experienced  response  time  for  a  certain  percentile  of
users. We can see that for up to 95 percent users, the
curves  stay  horizontal  and  less  than 2  seconds  (recall 
from  Figure  6  that  the  95  percentile  performance  for 
direct application access without attacks is 2 seconds). 
If  we  define  95%  users not being  affected  by DoS
attacks as successful DoS resilience, then the amount of
attack  traffic  can be  tolerated grows  linearly  with  the 
size of the proxy network.
