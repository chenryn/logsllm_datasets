### 5.2.2.2 Resisting Concentrated Attacks

**Figure 12: Performance under Concentrated Attacks (Static Edge Selection)**

Figure 12 illustrates the user-experienced performance during concentrated attacks. In these scenarios, the attack load is directed at a random subset of edge proxies. As a result, part of the proxy network becomes saturated, leading to congestion and packet loss, which affects a significant percentage of users. This effect is more pronounced with the static edge selection scheme.

**Performance Metrics:**
- **No Attack:** Baseline performance.
- **3.2 Gbps Attack on 32 Proxies:** Response time increases.
- **4.0 Gbps Attack on 32 Proxies:** Further degradation in response time.
- **6.0 Gbps Attack on 48 Proxies:** Significant impact on user experience.
- **6.0 Gbps Attack on 60 Proxies:** Maximum observed degradation.

**Response Time (seconds):**
- No Attack: Direct application access.
- No Attack: With Proxy Network.
- 3.2 Gbps Attack on 32 Proxies.
- 4.0 Gbps Attack on 32 Proxies.
- 6.0 Gbps Attack on 48 Proxies.
- 6.0 Gbps Attack on 60 Proxies.
- Direct Application Access.

### 5.2.2.3 Dynamic Edge Selection

We repeated the experiments for concentrated attacks, allowing users to switch to the closest non-saturated proxy (dynamic edge proxy selection). Figure 13 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of user-observed performance. Compared to Figure 12, the performance has significantly improved. For comparison, Figure 13 also includes the baseline case where users directly access the application without any attack traffic. The results show that, for most users, the proxy network can maintain slightly better performance than the baseline case, even under high attack loads (e.g., 6.0 Gbps). Therefore, proxy networks can effectively resist concentrated attacks.

**Figure 13: Performance under Concentrated Attacks (Dynamic Edge Selection)**

To understand the performance gap between the attack cases and the non-attack case, we measured the user-experienced performance without any attack (for the R1K network), using the same set of edge proxies they switched to during attacks (as shown in Figure 14). For most users, this curve closely follows the attack cases, indicating that the performance gap is due to switching edge proxies rather than congestion caused by attack traffic. Additionally, a small number of users are greatly affected by the attack due to the limitations of the underlying network, as discussed in Figure 11.

### 5.2.3 Scalability of Resilience

We explored how varying the size (width) of a proxy network affects its resilience to attacks. This is an important scaling property, showing how effectively larger proxy networks can resist larger-scale attacks.

**Experiment Goal:**
- Evaluate the amount of attack load proxy networks can withstand for different proxy network widths.
- Measure the user-observed performance when the attack magnitude is set to 95% of the proxy network's capacity.

**Capacity Definition:**
- The capacity of a proxy network is the sum of the link capacity of its edge proxies.
- Example: If the proxy network has 16 edge proxies, each with a 100 Mbps uplink, the capacity is 1.6 Gbps, and the aggregated attack magnitude is 1.52 Gbps.

**Results:**
- **Figure 15: Proxy Network Scaling Results**
  - X-axis: Number of edge proxies in the proxy network (all have height 3).
  - Y-axis: User-experienced response time for a certain percentile of users.
  - For up to 95 percent of users, the curves remain horizontal and below 2 seconds.
  - If 95% of users not being affected by DoS attacks is considered successful DoS resilience, the amount of attack traffic that can be tolerated grows linearly with the size of the proxy network.

**Scalability (R1K Network and R10K Network):**
- **Percentiles:**
  - 90th Percentile
  - 92nd Percentile
  - 95th Percentile
  - 97th Percentile

**Response Time (seconds):**
- Scalability (R1K Network)
- Scalability (R10K Network)

This analysis demonstrates that increasing the size of the proxy network enhances its resilience to concentrated attacks, ensuring better performance and reliability for users.
