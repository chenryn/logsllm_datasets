Question: A web application has a security mechanism in place to deny list certain SQL injection payloads. An attacker discovers that the application is vulnerable to HTTP Parameter Pollution. How could the attacker leverage the HPP vulnerability to bypass the security mechanism?
"A": "The attacker could send a SQL payload in fragmented form as multiple HTTP parameters and the server might concatenate them into a malicious string after passing the security checks.",
"B": "The attacker could repeatedly send the same SQL payload to overload the security mechanism and cause a denial of service.",
"C": "The attacker could encrypt the SQL injection payload to avoid detection by the security mechanism.",
"D": "The attacker could use the HPP vulnerability to directly disable the security mechanism on the server."
Answer: A
