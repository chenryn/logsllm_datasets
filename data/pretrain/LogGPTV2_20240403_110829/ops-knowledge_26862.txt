User: Whenever i try to make a HTTP request to some url through my django application which is running on top of apache mod_python (Machine: Ubuntu 10.04 server edition, 64-bits), it gives a timeout error.
The strange thing is that it works fine on Ubuntu 10.04 server edition, 32-bits.
I feel there could be some proxy connection issue. But i am not sure how to resolve it, if that is the case.
What could be the issue? Can anyone please throw some light on this.
Thanks in Advance.
Assistant: Run simple network analysis first, 
tracert
ping 
wireshark (for network analysis)
Check your firewall and proxy settings on the server and make sure the correct ports, routes and permissions are fine.
