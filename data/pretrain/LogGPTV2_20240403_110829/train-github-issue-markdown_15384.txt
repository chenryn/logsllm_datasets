Taking example 2 from the original issue (#5039):
    projectRoot
    ├── folder1
    │   ├── file1.ts
    │   └── file2.ts
    ├── generated
    │   ├── folder1
    │   └── folder2
    │       └── file3.ts (Contains: import 'folder1/file2';)
    └── tsconfig.json (with "baseUrl": ".")
When doing...
    import 'folder1/file2';
...in `file3.ts` it current compiles to the same thing as above. Would it be
possible if we could add a compiler option or some way that would convert this
to the relative path? So it would transpile it to:
    import './../../folder1/file2';
That way the paths don't have to be managed in two places. I couldn't find
this discussed anywhere and didn't want to clutter the original issue so I'm
opening this here.
