Build a Docker image: Use the Dockerfile and related resources to build a Docker image. 3. Upload the Docker image: Upload the built Docker image to Docker Hub or a private Docker repository. 4. Deploy the Docker container: use the Docker container to run the built image, and assign ports and protocols. 5. Monitoring and management: Monitor running containers and images, and manage, expand, upgrade and backup them as needed. 6. Integration and automation: Integrate and automate application deployment and management using DevOps tools and processes. For example, use Kubernetes or Docker Swarm for container orchestration, and Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD for automated builds and deployments. 7.
