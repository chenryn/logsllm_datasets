1/D(t) means the mean time interval between successive
CPs. We call D(t) the checkpoint density in this paper.

Next, let us consider an approximate method for the
ﬁnite-time horizon problem. Deﬁne
D(x)dx, t ≥ 0.
(16)
For the ﬁnite-time horizon problem in Eq.(7), the expected
operating cost can be approximated as
T C(tN ) ≈ T C(X(t), F (t))
c0X(t) + L({2X
(cid:4)
(cid:3)(t)}−1)
dF (t),
(17)
(cid:8)
(cid:7) T
where X(0) = 0 and X(T ) = N + 1.
Theorem 3.1 The optimal CP density minimizing the ex-
pected operating cost over a ﬁnite time horizon is given by
∗(t) =
D
L(cid:3)({2D(t)}−1)f(t)
2c0(β − F (t))
,
(18)
where β is a constant and is determined so as to satisfy
X(T ) = N + 1.
∗

∗(t) =
In Theorem 3.1, for an arbitrary N, we seek β so as
∗(x)dx (see Eq.(18)). For all
to satisfy N + 1 =
possible combinations of N, we calculate all βs satisfying
β > F (T ), the optimal number of CPs, N
, and the corre-
∗(t). Since β monotonically
sponding optimal CP density D
(cid:6)
increases as N decreases, the search space on N can be
rather limited. If L(t) = a0t + b0, then the optimal CP den-
a0f(t)/2c0(β − F (t)). It can
sity is given by D
be easily seen that the above CP density approaches to the
inﬁnite case as T → ∞ because of β → 1. In other words,
even when the system failure time is the exponential, the op-
timal CP density is the function of t and the optimal CP time
with relatively small T is not constant. This fact has not
been known in the past literature [5, 6, 10, 11, 19, 25, 28].
In fact, it can be checked numerically that the optimal solu-
tion of the ﬁnite-time horizon problem in Eq.(7), t∗
N , is not
a constant sequence for the exponential failure case.
In this section, we considered two CP placement prob-
lems with inﬁnite/ﬁnite time horizon, when the system fail-
ure time distribution is completely known.
If the system
failure time distribution F (t) can be speciﬁed in advance,
then the optimal CP sequence and the nearly optimal CP se-
quence based on the approximate methods can be obtained
numerically. However, if the information on the failure
time distribution is incomplete, the computation algorithm
as well as the variational approach to seek the approximate
CP sequence can not be applied for the practical use. In the
following section, we develop the min-max CP placement
methods in the case where the system failure time distribu-
tion is unknown.
4.1 Inﬁnite-Time Horizon Problem
We consider an estimation problem of the optimal CP
sequence t∗
∞ which minimizes the expected operating cost.
Suppose that the system failure time F (t) is unknown in the
operational phase of the ﬁle system. Under such an incom-
plete information on the system failure time distribution,
the most pessimistic approach is to derive the optimal CP
sequence under the circumstance where the system failures
most frequently occur. In other words, it will be appropriate
to derive the CP sequence satisfying
min
D(t)
max
F (t)
C(D(t), F (t)).
(19)
In this paper, we call the above CP sequence the min-max
CP sequence.
Lemma 4.1: The min-max checkpoint policy is symmetric,
the order of min− max operations in Eq.(19) is ex-
i.e.
changeable:
max
F (t)
min
D(t)
C(D(t), F (t)) = min
D(t)

C(D(t), F (t)). (20)

is represented by λ = 2ˆµ/3. Even if the arithmetic mean of

4.2 Finite-Time Horizon Problem
Next, consider the min-max CP sequence correspond-
ing to t∗
N . For the ﬁnite-time horizon problem, unfor-
tunately, we can not apply the similar technique as the
inﬁnite case, because the second variational problem on
∗(t), F (t)), can not be solved in
F (t), maxF (t) T C(D
the closed form. More precisely, the Euler equation for
∗(t), F (t)) is, after a few algebraic manip-
maxF (t) T C(D
