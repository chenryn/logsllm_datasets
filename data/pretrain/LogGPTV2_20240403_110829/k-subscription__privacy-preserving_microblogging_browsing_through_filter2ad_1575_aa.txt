ABSTRACT
1.
INTRODUCTION
Over the past few years, microblogging social networking services
have become a popular means for information sharing and com-
munication. Besides sharing information among friends, such ser-
vices are currently being used by artists, politicians, news chan-
nels, and information providers to easily communicate with their
constituency. Even though following speciﬁc channels on a mi-
croblogging service enables users to receive interesting informa-
tion in a timely manner, it may raise signiﬁcant privacy concerns
as well. For example, the microblogging service is able to observe
all the channels that a particular user follows. This way, it can infer
all the subjects a user might be interested in and generate a detailed
proﬁle of this user. This knowledge can be used for a variety of
purposes that are usually beyond the control of the users.
To address these privacy concerns, we propose k-subscription:
an obfuscation-based approach that enables users to follow privacy-
sensitive channels, while, at the same time, making it difﬁcult for
the microblogging service to ﬁnd out their actual interests. Our
method relies on obfuscation: in addition to each privacy-sensitive
channel, users are encouraged to randomly follow k −1 other chan-
nels they are not interested in. In this way (i) their actual interests
are hidden in random selections, and (ii) each user contributes in
hiding the real interests of other users. Our analysis indicates that
k-subscription makes it difﬁcult for attackers to pinpoint a user’s
interests with signiﬁcant conﬁdence. We show that this conﬁdence
can be made predictably small by slightly adjusting k while adding
a reasonably low overhead on the user’s system.

Microblogging social networking services, such as Twitter, Tum-
blr, Identi.ca and Fanfou, enable users to have timely access to
all their information and entertainment needs. Through a publish-
subscribe model, a user subscribes (“follows” in the language of
microblogging) to a number of other users, or information providers
in general (“channels”). These channels may correspond (i) to the
user’s friends, (ii) to artists the user is interested in, (iii) to politi-
cians the user supports, (iv) to news channels, (v) to religious chan-
nels, (vi) to hospitals or doctors, and so on. When a new message is
published in one of the channels a user follows, it appears on user’s
screen. This personalized information delivery, although useful,
raises some privacy concerns. For example, if a user follows a par-
ticular politician, the service may be able to infer the user’s political
beliefs. If the user follows a religious channel, the service may be
able to infer the user’s religious preferences. If the user follows a
channel about a particular health problem, the service may be able
to infer that the user is interested in this health problem.
As microblogging services become increasingly popular with
hundreds of million of users, such privacy concerns will become
even more crucial in the future. Indeed, by providing a handy user
interface and by co-locating all of a user’s interests into one con-
venient screen, microblogging services contain a huge amount of
information about users’ interests and needs. In this setting, there
may be users that although they really want to have access to timely
information, they may not be willing to disclose their personal pref-
erences and interests to the microblogging service, and potentially
to the corporations that may collaborate with it.
To avoid being identiﬁed, users may log into the microblogging
service using a pseudonym or a fake account. However, informa-
tion from the user’s IP address, third-party tracking cookies [15], or
browser ﬁngerprinting [8] may enable the microblogging service to
pinpoint the identity of the user and trace the fake account to a real
person. Although a fake account might seem to be giving a sense of
pseudonymity, it will not take long for a service to gather enough
information so as to correlate a fake account with a real identity. A
momentary lapse of vigilance is usually all it takes from the user
to provide ample identifying information to the microblogging ser-
vices. Another way to protect a user from being identiﬁed by a
microblogging service is to use an anonymization service to access
the Internet. For example, widely-used anonymous communication
networks, such as Tor [6], are effective at hiding a user’s real IP ad-
dress, but are of little help when the user logs into a service such
as a microblogging service. Additionally, a potential blocking of
Tor nodes will make it difﬁcult, if not impossible, to use it.
49One might envision to use both a fake account and Tor at the
same time in order to have stronger anonymity. Unfortunately, this
approach would still be subject to contamination from information
gathered during different browsing sessions, such as browser ﬁn-
gerprints or cookies, which would alternate between anonymous
and eponymous web browsing. To remedy this problem one might
use (i) a fake account, (ii) an anonymization network, such as Tor,
and (iii) a virtual machine per browsing session or destination web
site, so as to limit cross-contamination. Although this triplet seems
to provide a comfortable level of anonymity, its applicability and
ease of use is questionable: it is not clear whether ordinary users
will ﬁnd it easy to install all the necessary software. Also, mod-
ern devices, such as tablets and smartphones, which have rapidly
penetrated the market, may not be able to install virtual machines.
Numerous approaches have been proposed to conceal users’ ac-
tivities when browsing the web [4, 5, 9, 16]. However, none of them
can be adopted for microblogging services as the underlying threat
model or technical implementation does not ﬁt to the use case we
address in this paper. Most of the previously described approaches
rely on the fact that in order to conceal one’s interests we need to
hide one’s real identity. This paper addresses a world where this
is not easy, and may not even be possible.
Indeed, a wide vari-
ety of web tracking mechanisms aided by increasing legal pressure
on anonymity systems may lead to a world where anonymous web
surﬁng would practically belong to the past. At this point we see
two choices: (i) to believe that we will always be able to anony-
mously browse the web, and thus the massive losses of privacy we
see in real life will never percolate to cyberspace, or (ii) to proac-
tively develop privacy-preserving approaches for a world where it
will be difﬁcult, if not impossible, to hide one’s real identity.
In this study, we explore the second choice and develop new
obfuscation-based approaches to preserve privacy and conceal users’
real interests. Whenever a user is interested in following an actual
channel C1, she is encouraged to follow k − 1 noise channels as
well: C1, C2, C3, ..., Ck. If the user follows all these channels,
the microblogging service will not be sure which channel she is
actually interested in. Moreover, if there is a plethora of users fol-
lowing the channel C1 while they are not actually interested in it,
the microblogging service will not be able to identify the users that
are interested in C1. By ﬁne tuning this number of channels, users
are able to achieve the level of privacy they are comfortable with.
Obfuscation itself is an age-old idea. It has been used in war
to confuse radars detecting incoming bomber planes [23], in con-
sumer organizations through super market card swapping to con-
fuse marketers wanting to build customer proﬁles [10], and in web
searches [4,11] to hide the user’s real interests from search engines.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that obfuscation is
applied to provide privacy in the area of microblogging services. In
cases where it is not possible to hide an event, such as an approach-
ing war plane, a query to a search engine, and a channel followed in
a microblogging service, obfuscation provides a reasonable mech-
anism to confuse the adversary to the point of not being able to
distinguish real information from the added noise.
In this paper, we present the design and analysis of k-subscription:
our approach to obfuscate users’ real interests in microblogging
services. We study the anonymity provided by two different obfus-
cation strategies in an analytical way, and we evaluate the anonymity
offered by k-subscription in a realistic scenario using simulations.
To assess the practical feasibility and effectiveness of k-subscription,
we have implemented an extension for the Chrome browser that en-
ables privacy-preserving subscription to Twitter channels through
obfuscation. Our experimental evaluation shows that the overhead
introduced by k-subscription is reasonable in practice.
To summarize, we make the following main contributions:
1. We propose k-subscription: the ﬁrst obfuscation-based ap-
proach to hide a user’s interests in microblogging services.
Our approach encourages users to follow k − 1 noise chan-
nels apart from each channel they want, so as to hide (i) their
real interests in a set of k channels, and (ii) other users’ in-
terests in the microblogging service.
2. To quantify the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce
the Disclosure Probability PC . This is the
a new notion:
service’s conﬁdence that a user is interested in channel C.
3. We present an analytic evaluation of our approach and derive
closed-form formulas for the disclosure probability. These
formulas suggest that the disclosure probability can be made
predictably small by ﬁne-tuning the obfuscation level k.
4. We evaluate k-subscription in a more realistic scenario using
simulations, which are based on models derived from a real-
world dataset with sensitive channels from Twitter.
5. We implemented our system as a plug-in for the Chrome
browser using Twitter as case study. We experimentally eval-
uate our prototype and show that it has minimal bandwidth
requirements and negligible latency to browsing experience.
2. SYSTEM DESIGN
2.1 Threat Model
We assume the existence of a microblogging service where users
are able to follow individual channels. A channel can be the ac-
count of a physical person, of an entity such as a corporation, of a
news site, of a politician’s ofﬁce, and so on. Additionally, we as-
sume that the microblogging service is capable of recording the
users’ interests by observing which channels each user follows.
The information about the users’ interests, which is property of the
microblogging service, could be later sold to advertisers [21], and
could be used for a variety of purposes, all of which are beyond
the control of individual users [12]. We view this capability of the
microblogging service as a potential concern for the users’ privacy,
and we would like to develop mechanisms that hide the users’ real
interests from the microblogging service.
In this work we assume an “honest but curious” microblogging
service. In this aspect, the microblogging service may try to ﬁnd
the user’s interest based on the channels the user is following, but
it will not try to “cheat” by actively interfering with the process
users are employing to protect their privacy, or try to gain more
information than what a user is willing, or required, to give. For
example, the microblogging service will not create fake channels
or fake users in order to break the anonymity of ordinary users. We
think that this “honest but curious” model is reasonable in practice,
as popular microblogging services have a reputation they do not
want to jeopardize by becoming hostile against their own users.
Therefore, we expect such microblogging services to only try to
passively gain knowledge based on data given by their users.
We also assume that when users follow channels, they act as con-
sumers of information and refrain from interacting with any chan-
nel by posting information, replying, retweeting, or sharing their
interests in any other way. Indeed, if a user starts posting about
a sensitive issue, it will be easy for the microblogging service to
identify the user’s interests. We believe that most users want to
ﬁnd and consume information about a sensitive issue, and they will
not take the risk of being identiﬁed by posting information about
it. If some users would like to post, reply, or retweet anonymously
about a sensitive issue, they may use k-subscription in combination
with alternative solutions, such as #h00t [3] and Hummingbird [5].

Table 1: Summary of Notation
2.2 Our Approach: k-subscription
Table 1 summarizes the notation we use throughout this section.
Assume that user A is interested in following channel C, which
deals with a sensitive issue, such as a medical condition. If user A
follows only this channel, the microblogging service would easily
ﬁgure out that A is interested in this medical issue. In this paper
we propose k-subscription: a system that makes sure that the mi-
croblogging service is not able to pinpoint A’s interests with rea-
sonable accuracy. To do so, k-subscription follows an obfuscation-
based approach, which advocates that along with each channel C
the user is interested to follow, she should also follow k − 1 other
channels (called “noise” channels). The number of noise channels
are such that the microblogging service will not be able to deter-
mine A’s interest with high probability, and will not be able to iden-
tify the actual set of users interested in each speciﬁc channel. All
the noise channels are randomly chosen from a set S of “sensitive”
channels. Note that A’s real interests are also members of S.
2.3 Uniform Sampling
When a user wants to follow channel C, k-subscription encour-
ages the user to follow k − 1 other channels as well (say C1, C2,
..., Ck−1). In this way, the microblogging service will not know
whether the user is actually interested in channel C or one of the
C1, C2, ..., Ck−1.
In our ﬁrst algorithm, k-subscription-UNIF,
these channels are chosen randomly with uniform probability from
S. Algorithm 1 presents the pseudocode for k-subscription-UNIF.
Algorithm 1 k-subscription-UNIF: Choose noise channels uni-
formly from the set S
F = ∅; // initialize the set of channels to follow
for (i = 1 ; i ≤ k − 1 ; i + +) do
Ci = randomly select a channel from set S ;
S = S \ Ci ; // remove Ci from S
F = F ∪ Ci ; // add Ci in the set of channels to follow
end for
F = F ∪ C ; // add C in the set of channels to follow
Follow all Channels in F in a random order ;
k-subscription-UNIF is a naive but powerful approach for obfus-
cation and we use it as a basic principle for our method. However,
this approach leads to some practical problems. In case that not all
channels enjoy the same popularity, then uniformly sampling from
S may result in higher disclosure probability for the more popular
channels. Thus, we discuss an improved version in the next section.
2.4 Proportional Sampling
A user following a popular channel (say C) along with several
unpopular ones has a higher probability of being interested in C
than in the rest of them. Capitalizing on this knowledge, the mi-
croblogging service has a better chance of ﬁnding those users who
follow popular channels. To mitigate this issue, we propose k-
subscription-PROP that sample channels from set S according to
their popularity. Assume that UC is the number of followers of
channel C and US = P∀C∈S UC is the number of followers of all
channels in S. Thus, instead of sampling all channels with prob-
ability 1/|S|, we sample channel C with probability UC/US . In
Twitter, the popularity of a channel can be inferred by the number
of users following the respective account. In other microblogging
services similar metrics are available to determine the popularity
of a channel. k-subscription with proportional sampling for adding
noise does not affect the respective channel popularity.
2.5 Following Multiple Channels
Users may be interested in following more than one sensitive
channels. Using k-subscription, users just need to select k −1 other
noise channels to follow for each channel C they are interested in.
Therefore, a user interested in following N channels will result in
following k × N channels in total. However, it is very likely that
a user will be interested in N sensitive channels that are semanti-
cally related. This case may signiﬁcantly increase the disclosure
probability. Indeed, the microblogging service can easily ﬁnd the
correlated channels: it will get all the channels a user is follow-
ing, classify them into semantic categories, and identify the sets of
channels that are semantically related. If there is only one set of
related channels, it is more probable that the user actually follows
them, and the remaining unrelated channels are the selected noise.
One way to address this issue could be the following: when-
ever a user is interested in N related channels, the (k − 1) × N
noise channels could be selected in N -tuple groups, so that each
N -tuple consists of N related noise channels. However, this ap-
proach has a certain limitation: the microblogging service and k-
subscription may use different similarity metrics to identify related
channels. For instance, the microblogging service may use a more
ﬁne-grained similarity metric to ﬁnd out the actual related channels.
Fortunately, k-subscription is able to protect users’ interests even
when they are interested in multiple semantically related channels.
Although a user will actually follow the set of N related sensi-
tive channels she is interested in, which can be identiﬁed by the
microblogging service, there will be a signiﬁcant number of other
users that also follow the same set of N related channels due to
random noise channel selections, i.e., without being interested in
them. This is due to the increased random selections when users
are interested in multiple channels. Thus, the microblogging ser-
vice will not be able to know which of the users following all these
N related channels are actually interested in them.
3. ANALYTICAL EVALUATION
3.1 Analysis of k-subscription-UNIF
The disclosure probability PC is the probability (as it can be
calculated by the microblogging service) that a user who follows
channel C is really interested in C. In our analysis we assume that
the microblogging service is able to infer each channel’s popularity
UC by the number of its followers or other external information,
the number of users U that have adopted k-subscription, the size
of set S that is publicly released, and the value of k used by each
