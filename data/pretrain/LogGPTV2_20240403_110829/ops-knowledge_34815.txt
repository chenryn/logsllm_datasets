User: I'm newbie to Python. I'd like to code a script running on Linux.
To test if user enter all the script arguments:

If user type: myscript => print "Usage: myscript [Dir] [Old] [New]"
If user type: myscript Dir => print "Please enter Old and New"
If user type: myscript Dir Old => print "Please enter New" 
If user type all the required arguments, then execute the main().

How to code myscript?
Assistant: All arguments that are passed when running your script will be placed in sys.argv. You have to import sys first. And then go through the arguments as you would like to. You might consider counting how many arguments you have to decide what to do. And note that the first argument is always the name of your script.
