We manually inspected the vulnerable domains from
Alexa 1M. Table 3 lists the types of organizations af-
fected. ’Business’ is a large category that covers a het-
erogeneous set of companies, from small to large.
In
the latter category, we ﬁnd a variety of sites related to
global car manufacturers. We also ﬁnd 56 vulnerable
governmental sites in the North America, Europe, Asia
– some national, some regional. Aﬀected educational
domains have a similar geographical distribution and
include a few reputable universities. In health care, we
found several hospitals and the domain of a national
medical association. Remarkably, nine of the vulner-
able domains belong to banks in Europe, Middle East
and Asia, ranging from a small private banking ﬁrm to a
domain of one of the largest banks in the world. In sum:
the vulnerability is found to undermine the security of
high-proﬁle businesses, governments and organizations.
5.3 Exploitation
We looked for evidence of whether non-secure up-
dates were exploited in the wild. We checked the over-
lap between the vulnerable domains and domains black-

listed by StopBadware [5] and the Anti-Phishing Work-
ing Group (APWG) [2] in 2015. The former consists of
1,016,961 unique fully qualiﬁed domain names (FQDNs)
whereas the latter of 1,967,995. In APWG and Stop-
Badware, respectively, we ﬁnd 15 and 45 blacklisted
FQDNs related to vulnerable second-level domains for
Alexa 1M and only 1 and 5 for the random sample. Af-
ter manual inspection of the website content, we did
not ﬁnd any compelling evidence that the observed do-
mains are actually aﬀected by malicious dynamic up-
dates. The sites seemed legitimate and might either
represent false positives or compromised resources.
We also searched in DNSDB for FQDN of vulnerable
domains in association with common words in phishing
attacks [8, 7], such as Paypal, Apple, Taobao, Ama-
zon, etc. We ﬁnd some suspicious FQDNs, for example,
shopping.*.com.*.*.edu or *.alibaba.com.*.ru.
However, the sites are either oﬄine or require some ad-
ditional authentication to access. Some of them seem
legitimate proxy services, e.g., university resources that
require authorized access and redirect users to an ex-
ternal website.
5.4 Affected DNS Server Software
We surveyed the software running on non-secure au-
thoritative name servers to see which packages were af-
fected. On Apr 24, 2016 we scanned three groups of
servers by using FPDNS software [6]: i) all 510,850 name
servers from the random sample, for comparative pur-
poses; ii) the 188 vulnerable servers from the random
sample; and iii) the 560 vulnerable servers from the
Alexa 1M sample. Fingerprinting failed in many cases
due to timeouts or inconclusive signatures. We were
able to obtain software information for 45% (232,317),
38% (72), and 41% (227) of each respective group. We
do not distinguish between diﬀerent software versions
as there are no major changes in the implementation of
secure DNS dynamic updates (cf. Section 2.3). Figure
3 illustrates the results for DNS software ﬁngerprinting.
The majority of servers authoritative for the total ran-
dom sample run BIND (37%). Microsoft Windows DNS
constitutes just 0.5% of this group, while for the vulner-

able groups it is the dominant package: 19% and 27%.
The second and third largest groups of vulnerable server
types are NLnetLabs NSD and ISC BIND. As the stan-
dard package of NLnetLabs NSD does not include the
functionality for dynamic updates, we suspect that it
might be added through some external, RFC-compliant
plugin (see Section 2.3).
5.5 Survival Analysis
The ﬁnal part of the study aimed to measure the sur-
vival times of the added records. We wanted to analyze
whether these records would be removed and, if so, how
soon. In other words, are there self-correcting mecha-
nisms in place?
We initiated measurement on Apr 16, 2016. We ﬁrst
sent an update request to add an extra A RR (see Sec-
tion 4.2) to the previously conﬁrmed instances of vul-
nerable domains. We observe 3,920 successfully added A
records that correspond to 1,870 domain names for 1%
sample and 1,691 A RR associated with 584 domains for
Alexa 1M domains.
Then, over a 10-day period, we performed DNS lookups
every 4 hours—sending an A RR request to each of the
IP addresses of the servers associated with vulnerable
domains. We performed survival analysis on the results
using the standard Kaplan-Meier estimator to approxi-
mate the survival function [22].
The results indicate a very small removal rate of the
added record (cf. Figure 4). We do not know why some
records were removed, but one plausible explanation is
that the zone transfer from the primary master may

At the end of our
experiment, records were still present in around 94.3%
(3,696) of the random sample and 95.9% (1,622) of the
Alexa 1M domains. Interestingly enough, the Alexa 1M
does not have a higher removal rate than the random
sample; in fact, it does slightly worse. In light of the
fact that we were not contacted by any of the operators
of the non-secure servers, suggesting no one saw the
added record, it seems that there are no other security
mechanisms in place to discover and mitigate the threat.
6. CONCLUSIONS
We presented the ﬁrst measurement study into the
vulnerability of non-secure DNS dynamic updates, which
enables an attack we referred to as zone poisoning. We
have measured prevalence rates for a random sample of
2.9 million domains (0.065%) and for the Alexa top 1
million domains (0.062%) and found that the vulnera-
bility poses a serious security ﬂaw that deserves more
attention from domain owners and DNS service opera-
tors.
Certain limitations have to be taken into account to
contextualize the obtained results. First, and perhaps
foremost, we should note that our measurements estab-
lish a conservative lower bound for the magnitude of the
problem. The servers that rely on address match lists to
secure dynamic updates are counted as ’secure’ in our
measurement, but they are still vulnerable to IP spoof-
ing. The attack requires only a single packet, making
it possible for attackers to guess addresses that are on
the match list.
The datasets in our study also present certain inher-
ent limitations. For example, DNSDB has extensive,
but not complete coverage of the domain name space.
It also contains entries that are poisoned or obsolete,
so many servers did not respond to our dynamic up-
dates. Finally, we should note that responsibility is dis-
tributed and complicated. The fact that we found cer-
tain providers and software packages to be associated
with vulnerable domains, should not be interpreted as
assigning blame.
The next step for this work is to expand measure-
ment and notify all aﬀected parties, in order to improve
the security of the DNS ecosystem, a critical service for
many applications.
