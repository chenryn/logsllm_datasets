### Response Time and Prediction Accuracy

**Response Time Definition:**
The response time is defined as the duration from when the Backend (BE) receives a request forwarded by the Frontend (FE) to when the BE sends the response back to the FE. This metric, as observed by the FE, is also our target variable (see Section 7.1).

**Dataset Features:**
Table 1 outlines the features in the dataset from Googleâ€™s Content Delivery Network (CDN).

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| F       | Feature 1   |
| D       | Feature 2   |
| C       | Feature 3   |

**Prediction Accuracy:**
Figures 8(a), (b), and (c) compare the normalized response-time distributions for three scenarios:
- **Germany (Figure 8a):** Original vs. Predicted
- **South Africa (Figure 8b):** Original vs. Predicted
- **Japan (Figure 8c):** Original vs. Predicted

**Relative Prediction Error:**
Figure 9 shows the relative prediction error for the scenarios in Figure 8. The error is defined as \( \frac{|rt - brt|}{rt} \), where \( rt \) is the ground-truth value and \( brt \) is the predicted value. The median error lies between 8-11%.

**Comparison with TCP Transfer Latency Estimation:**
We compared WISE with two parametric models for TCP transfer latency: AKM [2] and CSA [5]. These models were modified to account for additional latencies, such as round-trip time from the FE to the BE and backend server processing time. Table 2 presents the median relative error for response-time estimation.

| Method | deu | zaf | jp |
|--------|-----|-----|----|
| WISE   | 18% | 12% | 15% |
| AKM    | 55% | 35% | 38% |
| CSA    | 45% | 120% | 50% |

**Live What-if Scenario Evaluation:**
We evaluated WISE's ability to predict the response-time distribution for customers of AS 9498, a large consumer ISP in India, during a reconfiguration event. The scenario involved changing the serving FE from India (im) to Taiwan (tw), resulting in an average latency increase of about 135ms for customers of AS 9498.

**Scenario Specification:**
- **USE WHERE as_num==9498 AND fe==im AND be==tw**
- **INTERVENE SET fe=tw**

If the training dataset already contains RTT estimates for customers in AS 9498 to the FE in Taiwan, WISE updates the scenario distribution automatically. If not, the RTT values can be explicitly provided:

- **USE WHERE as_num==9498 AND fe==im AND be==tw**
- **INTERVENE SET febe_rtt=3**
- **INTERVENE SET rtt+=135**

**Results:**
Figure 10 shows the ground truth and predicted distributions for response time and intermediary variables (RTT and server-side retransmissions) for users in AS 9498 on July 16th and 17th. WISE slightly underestimates the distributions, primarily due to insufficient training data. The maximum cumulative distribution differences for the three variables were between 7-9%.

### Controlled Experiments
To further validate WISE, we conducted controlled experiments on a small-scale web server setup, as live production network evaluation is limited by available datasets and event variety.
