**ATT&CK ID:** T1498.002  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Reflection Amplification

Adversaries may attempt to cause a denial of service (DoS) by reflecting a high volume of network traffic to a target. This type of Network DoS attack leverages a third-party server, known as a reflector, which will respond to requests sent with a spoofed source IP address. The adversary conducts the reflection attack by sending packets to these reflectors, using the victim's IP address as the source. 

Similar to direct network floods, multiple systems or a botnet can be used to execute the attack. Additionally, one or more reflectors can be employed to concentrate the traffic on the target, thereby amplifying the impact. This Network DoS attack not only disrupts the availability and functionality of the targeted system(s) but also degrades the overall performance of the affected network.

### Key Points:
- **Reflection Attack Mechanism:** Adversaries send packets to reflectors with the victim's spoofed IP address.
- **Amplification:** The use of multiple reflectors and/or a botnet can significantly increase the volume of traffic directed at the target.
- **Impact:** The attack reduces the availability and functionality of the targeted system(s) and network.
