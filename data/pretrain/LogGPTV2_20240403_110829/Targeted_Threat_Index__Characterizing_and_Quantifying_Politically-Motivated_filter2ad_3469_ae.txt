for rating the sophistication of technical vulnerabilities
and research has been done on detecting targeted mal-
ware attacks and modeling campaigns, there is no scor-
ing system that considers both the sophistication of mal-
ware and social engineering tactics used in targeted mal-
ware attacks. We address this gap through development
of the TTI and validate the metric against four years of
data collected from 10 CSOs.
7 Conclusions
Our study provides an in-depth look at targeted malware
threats faced by CSOs. We ﬁnd that considering the
technical sophistication of these threats alone is insuf-
ﬁcient and that educating users about social engineer-
ing tactics used by adversaries can be a powerful tool
for improving the security of these organizations. Our
results point to simple steps groups can take to protect
themselves from document-based targeted malware such
as shifting to cloud-based document platforms instead
of relying on attachments which can contain exploits.
Further research is needed to measure the effectiveness
of education strategies for changing user behaviour and
how effective these efforts are in mitigation of document-
based malware for CSOs. Further work is also required
in monitoring how attackers adapt tactics in response to
observed behavioural changes in targeted communities.
In ongoing work we are continuing our collection of e-
mails and NIDS alerts as well as monitoring other attacks
against these groups (e.g., waterhole attacks and DoS at-
tacks) to understand how threats vary based on their de-
livery mechanism. We are also working to extend our
methodology to more diverse CSO communities such as
those in Latin America, Africa, and other underreported
regions to better document the politically motivated dig-
ital threats they may be experiencing.

Appendix
A Examples of targeted e-mails
In this section, we provide speciﬁc examples of e-mails
that would be assigned targeting scores described in Sec-
tion 4.2.2.
Targeting Score 1 (Targeted Not customized). The e-
mail in Figure 6 was sent to Tibet group 1. The message
content and sender are vague and do not relate to the in-
terest of the group. The attachment is a word document
implanted with malware. The lack of relevant informa-
tion in this message gives it a score of 1 (targeted, not
customized).
Targeting Score 2 (Targeted, Poorly Customized).
The e-mail in Figure 7 was sent to Tibet group 1. It refer-
ences Tibetan self-immolations which is an issue of inter-
est to the group. However, the sender does not appear to
be from a real person or organization. The message con-
tent is terse and does not referenced information that can
be externally validated. Therefore this message scores a
2 (targeted, poorly customized).

Attached is a list of tibetans who have

prepared for me, but i am not sure of its
accuracy. Would you please have a look
and make necessary corrections.
I will be
really much appreciated if you could do me
the favor and offer some more information
about the latest happenings inside tibet.
Thank you again and happy Tib losar!

Figure 9: Example of e-mail with Targeting Score 4
Targeting Score 3 (Targeted Customized).
The e-
mail in Figure 8 was sent to Tibet group 2. On the sur-
face it appears to be a professional e-mail from “Palden
Sangpo” a consultant at the Tibet Career Centre. The
e-mail sender address and signature reference accurate
contact details that can be easily veriﬁed through an In-
ternet search. However, the e-mail headers reveal the
purported e-mail sender address is fraudulent and the
actual sender was albano_kuqo@gmx.com. The e-mail
generally addresses the organization rather than the indi-
vidual recipient. Therefore this message scores a 3 (tar-
geted, customized).
Targeting Score 4 (Targeted Personalized).
The e-
mail in Figure 9 was sent to Tibet group 1. It is directly
addressed to the director of the group and appears to
come from Mr. Cheng Li, a prominent China scholar
based at the Brookings Institute. The e-mail address
is made to appear to be from Mr. Cheng Li, but from
an AOL account (PI:EMAIL) that was
registered by the attackers. The message asks the recip-
ient for information on recent Tibetan self-immolations.
The level of customization and personalization used in
this message gives it a score of 4 (targeted, personalized).
Targeting Score 5 (Targeted Highly Personalized).
Targeting scores of 5 (targeted, highly personalized) re-
quire reference to internal information to the target orga-
nization that could not be obtained through open sources.
Examples of messages scoring at this level include an
e-mail that purported to come from a funder of China
Group 3 that provided details of an upcoming meeting
the group actually had scheduled with the funder.
In
another example, Tibet Group 2 and Tibet Group 3 re-
ceived separate e-mails that contained speciﬁc personal
details about a South African group’s visit to Dharam-
sala, India that appear to have been repurposed from a
real private communication. The malicious attachment
contained an authentic travel itinerary, which would be
displayed after the user opened the document. The pri-
vate information used in these messages suggest that the
attackers performed signiﬁcant reconnaissance of these
groups and likely obtained the information through prior
compromise.
