### Title: BlackHat US-22: ELF Section Docking: Revisiting Stageless Payload Delivery

When it comes to generating and delivering malware on Linux, offensive operators have several options. Some objectives require dynamic payload bootstrapping from the network, while others necessitate stageless implants. Often, malware with bundled payloads can be easily detected and analyzed. However, there are opportunities to enhance the process of embedding payloads in standalone implants, thereby increasing their survivability.

This talk will explore advancements in static payload embedding and loading. We will revisit the mechanisms of constructing ELF binaries, focusing on how ELF sections can facilitate successful payload hosting, retrieval, and execution. 

We will introduce the concept of "ELF section docking," where a section containing the payload can be independently attached to a payload-agnostic loader. This approach can be extended to support in-field (re-)attachment of sections to loaders without the need for compilers, which is particularly useful for long-term offensive operations.

Additionally, we will demonstrate how ELF section docking can serve as an alternative to executable packing for handling complex payloads. This method provides teams with more flexibility and options in various payload delivery scenarios. We will also discuss detection opportunities and the evasion features implemented in a proof-of-concept loader and injector tool, which will be released during the talk.

We believe that ELF section docking can help address some of the challenges associated with payload bundling for offensive operators and provide new insights for defenders to detect and respond to this technique.
