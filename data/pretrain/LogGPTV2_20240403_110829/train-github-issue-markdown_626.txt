When working in a CSS file (or presumably any type of file), if the file is
updated from an outside source, the position of the page will reset causing
you to have to scroll back down to where you were.
Case: When working in CSS, I often work both directly in the CSS and via
Chrome Dev Tools (changes are autosaved to the local CSS). Every time the file
changes via Chrome Dev Tools, Atom resets the scroll position.
Sublime Text handles this perfectly. Any changes are just updated but your
position is never lost. This can probably be solved by just capturing the
current line number before the file resets, then going back to that number.
