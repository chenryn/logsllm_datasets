Starting with version `2.0.0`, Spring Cloud Sleuth uses Brave as the tracing
library. This project use Dubbo TraceFilter implemented by brave-
instrumentation-dubbo-rpc. The Project configuration as below:
application.properties
    spring.sleuth.web.enabled=true
    spring.sleuth.web.client.enabled=true
    spring.sleuth.sampler.probability=0.0
    spring.sleuth.log.slf4j.enabled=true
    spring.application.name=${dubbo.app}
dubbo.xml
we found that some time we lost the tracing information when invoke dubbo
service from ServiceB to ServiceC.  
the two service log infomation as below:

the tracing infomation of the first and second invocation is lost, and the
third is passed. and we also found that the thread name of the invocation
which is lost tracing is all start with [http-nio], but the thread name start
with [DubboServerHandler-] got the tracing infomation. We don't know the
underlying mechanism between this two invocation.
the tracing infomation is injected into the attachments of the RpcInvocation.
We debug and found that  
`AbstractProxyInvoker` is not get and pass down the attachments
