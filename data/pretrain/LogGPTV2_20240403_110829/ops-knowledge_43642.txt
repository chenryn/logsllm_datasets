User: Is there an easy way to switch between using Anaconda (Python 2) and Anaconda3 (Python 3) from the command line? I am on Windows 10.
Assistant: If you are using Linux/Mac OS, edit your ~/.bashrc. For example, if you do not wanna use anaconda3, comment the line which add path_to_anaconda3 to your system PATH.
