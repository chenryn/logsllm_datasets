objects, and the RSS is equivalent to a scaled version of RCS (Eq. (1)),
we can directly apply an FFT to the tag‚Äôs RSS to generate its RCS
frequency spectrum. Finally, the coding peaks are normalized by the
overall power within the coding band and detected and decoded
following the model in Sec. 5.1. Taking the 4-bit tag in Fig. 10a as an
example, we show the measured frequency spectrum of the tag and
the tripod‚Äôs RSS in Fig. 11d. The measured RSS frequency spectrum
of the tag has 4 coding peaks around 6, 7.5, 9, 10.5ùúÜ, which match
the ones in the simulated RCS frequency spectrum in Fig. 10c.

7.1 Experimental Method
Implementation. We fabricate RoS tags following the standard
PCB production process. Stacks with different number of beam-
shaped PSVAA are designed in HFSS and imported into Altium
Designer to generate PCB design files. Although our PSVAA de-
sign can filter out environmental reflections, large objects that are
extremely close to the tag may still leak reflections into the orthog-
onal polarity and interfere with the tag‚Äôs response. Our initial setup
mounted the tag on a basal wood board which has a much larger
electronic signature causing interference. Therefore, we replaced
the board with a wooden frame which has a smaller cross sectional
area, thus reducing the interference and improving SNR. Fig. 12a
shows an example assembled tag, which has 5 vertical stacks and
encodes 4 bits ‚Äú1111≈æ. Each stack has 32 PSVAAs. The stacks can be
reconfigured to encode different bit sequences following Sec. 5.2.
The radar‚Äôs Tx and Rx antennas should have orthogonal polar-
ization directions to receive backscattered signals from PSVAAs.
Typical patch antennas are linearly polarized, just like the TI radar
used in our experiments, so we simply rotate one Tx or Rx antenna
by 90‚ó¶ to achieve an orthogonal polarity. The radar‚Äôs front-end
hardware schematics [22] remain intact. Note that if the antenna
with the original polarity is still desired, one can simple add a
polarized antenna and use an RF switch to toggle between the two.
Evaluation setup. We assemble RoS tags with different cod-
ing bits, attach the tags to a tripod and place it on the roadside
for measurement. By default, we set the TI radar‚Äôs parameters as
follows: frame duration 60 ùúás, frame repetition rate ùêπùë† = 1 kHz,
frequency slope 66 MHz/ùúás, baseband sampling rate 5 Msps, and
the number of samples per frame equals 256. The radar uses one
original Tx antenna for object detection and the polarization switch-
ing Tx antenna for tag decoding. 4 Rx antennas are used to achieve
a beamwidth around of 28.6‚ó¶. To control the variables in the micro-
benchmark experiments, the radar was mounted on a cart and
manually moved. A stereo camera [54] was co-located with the
radar to obtain its ground truth positions relative to the tag. To
evaluate system robustness against adverse weather, a fog genera-
tor [11] is used to emulate real fog, as shown in Fig. 12c. For field
testing under vehicle speed, we further mounted the radar on a
sedan (Fig. 12d) which moved along straight trajectories passing
by the RoS tag.
Evaluation metrics. RoS encodes bit ‚Äú1≈æ with peaks and bit ‚Äú0≈æ
with nulls in the RCS spectrum which can be considered an on-off
keying (OOK) modulation scheme. Directly computing bit error rate
(BER) of the decoding scheme entails repeating the drive-through
experiments millions of times which is infeasible. We thus measure
the SNR of the coding peaks and then convert it to BER. Intuitively,
coding peaks with higher SNR are more prominent, and thus easier
to be correctly decoded. Specifically, the SNR equals (ùúá1 ‚àí ùúá0)2/ùúé 2,
where ùúáùëñ is the average amplitude of bit ‚Äúi≈æ and ùúé is the standard
deviation of the coding peak amplitudes. The SNR to BER mapping
follows the OOK model where BER =
example, a 15.8 dB SNR corresponds to a BER of 0.1%.

7.2 Performance of RoS Tag
Tag detection. Recall that RoS uses the polarization suppression
and point cloud size as features to discriminate the tag from other
objects (Sec. 6). To verify this approach, we place the RoS tag on the
roadside with common objects nearby, e.g., parking meter, street
lamp, ordinary road signs, pedestrian and trees, which are less than
0.5 m from the tag. The minimum distance of the radar is 3 m as
it passes by the tag. Fig. 13a shows the RSS loss achieved by the
polarization switching mechanism (Sec. 4.2). While background
objects more or less affect the polarization of reflected signals, they
experience a median RSS rejection of 16-19 dB. In contrast, the
median RSS loss of the RoS tag is only around 13 dB, implying that
the tag-reflected signals tend to be much stronger than background
reflections. Fig. 13b further shows that the point cloud size of the

Impact of distance. In practice, vehicles may pass by a RoS
tag across different lanes corresponding to different radar-to-tag
interrogation distances (Fig. 1). We evaluate the impact using 3
types of tags with 8, 16, and 32 PSVAAs per stack. Fig. 15a shows
that the RSS decreases over distance following the path loss model
(Eq. (1)). The tags with 8, 16, and 32 PSVAAs per stack cannot be
detected beyond 4, 5, and 6 m respectively as their RSS drops near
the noise floor of the TI radar. Thus, different types of tags can be
deployed depending on the number of lanes on the road. Fig. 15b
shows the corresponding SNR. While the SNR of all tags remains
above 14 dB (i.e., a BER of 0.6%), the 8-array and 16-array tags have
statistically higher SNR than the 32-array tags. The main reason
lies in the longer far field distance of the 32-array. Specifically, as
shown in Fig. 12a, the height of a 32-array PSVAA stack is about
10.8 cm, corresponding to a far field distance of 6.14 m following
Eq. (8). In contrast, the far field distance is 0.31 m and 1.36 m for
the 8- and 16-array tags respectively. In other words, in most of
the test cases (1-6 m range), the 32-array tags only work in its near
field where the spatial encoding model is inaccurate, which causes
the SNR degradation.
7.3 Practical Vehicular Scenarios
Multi-tag and multi-radar interference. Recall that we can place
multiple RoS tags side by side to encode more data bits. To evaluate
the cross-tag interference, we place two tags 3 m away from the
radar and adjust their separation so that their spread angle viewed
by the radar ranges from 10‚ó¶ to 30‚ó¶. Fig. 16a shows that the SNR
of the tags only slightly increases with the increase of their spread
angle, indicating the interference between tags is negligible.
In addition, two vehicles can simultaneously interrogate the
same tag as they pass by as long as the tag is within FoV of the vehi-
cles. To examine the potential interference, we repeat the decoding
experiment with 2 TI radars. The spacing between the radars varies
from 1 to 3 m with a step of 0.5 m to account for realistic separation
between adjacent vehicles. Fig. 16b shows that the tag SNR slightly
increases with larger separation between the radars. Nonetheless,
the SNR remains above 15 dB even at an extremely close separation
of 1 m. The reasons are two fold. First, due to the PSVAA design,
the RoS tag retroreflects signals back to the source and thus sup-
presses the interference between radars (see Fig. 4). Second, while
other surrounding objects may create specular reflections between
radars, such interference is transient in the angular domain and
only slightly raises the noise floor in the frequency domain. Since
RoS encodes bits in the frequency domain, these specular reflec-
tions have little impact on it. However, detection and decoding of

RoS tag is much smaller than all other objects except pedestrians, so
it represents an effective feature to discriminate the tags. Owing to
the two discriminative features, i.e., higher RSS and smaller point cloud
size, RoS can correctly identify the tags without any miss detection
or false alarm in all our tests. Note that the objects with sufficient
