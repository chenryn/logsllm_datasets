falls between 0.089 to 0.328 m/s2 for x axis. For y axis, this
value is between 0.108 and 0.268 m/s2 while the variations
for maximum range in absence of speech are contained around
0.218 m/s2. The sample readings follow the same variation
pattern in presence of speech as in absence of speech for z
axis falling between 0.178 to 0.305 m/s2.
C. Motion Sensors vs. Laptop Speakers
For the Laptop-Same-Surface scenario, we use laptop speak-
ers instead of loudspeakers. A laptop’s speaker is less powerful
than a loudspeaker especially in reproducing low frequency
sounds accurately. In our experiments, we used Macbook Air
2013 model laptop and IBM Thinkpad W530 laptop to test
the effect of speech signals generated by their speakers on the
motion sensors of a smartphone placed nearby on the same
surface. We chose surface 3 as it was able to show response
to 280Hz beginning at 92db which the wooden surfaces were
unable to show. We set the volume level in the laptops at their
maximum value to induce most response from the motion
sensors. Since sound pressure level also depends upon the
generated signal, we report the sound pressure level for each
tested signal accordingly.
Recreating the steps used in the loudspeaker setup (Section
VI-B), we ﬁrst test the response of the motion sensors against
a 280Hz tone and a multi-tone signal (130-200Hz) generated
by Macbook Air. The spectrum of the frequency domain
for gyroscope and accelerometer reveal no response for the
280Hz tone. For the multi-tone signal, the accelerometer shows
a faint response along z axis as per Figure 5. Contrasting
the result with the results obtained under loudspeaker setup
in Section VI-B1, we ﬁnd that
the loudspeaker was able
to correctly reproduce multi-tone signal that affected both
gyroscope and the accelerometer at 92db. The speaker from
laptop was only able to output the multi-tone signal at an
average sound pressure level of 67db and hence was unable to
produce any noticeable effect on gyroscope and a slight effect
on accelerometer along z axis.
Thinkpad W530’s speakers performed worse and were un-
able to output any audible sound for the multi-tone signal with
the average sound pressure level of 52db and no response was
produced on the frequency spectrum of either the gyroscope
readings or the accelerometer readings. Since laptop speakers
are not designed to produce enough bass effect, low frequency
sounds tend to get lost or distorted when played via laptop
speakers. In addition, due to limited sound volume, they are
unable to induce vibrations in the surface, that are powerful
enough to affect the motion sensors.
Similar behavior is observed when we played male and
female speech samples from the word data set as detailed in
Section VI-A. Both male and female speech samples could
only be generated at a sound pressure level of 80db and
71db respectively and were unable to generate any response

Different-Surface scenario and is depicted in Appendix Figure
3. It is a recreation of the experimental setup of [2].
Frequency Domain Analysis: The analysis of the motion
sensor signals shows no visible indication of speech signal
footprints in the frequency spectrum (Appendix Figure 5).
This behavior follows the behavior of Loudspeaker-Different-
Surface scenario from Section VI-B2. Since phone speakers
are considerably less powerful than a loudspeaker system, we
expect them to perform worse than loudspeakers.
Time Domain Analysis: The results of time domain analysis
of the sensor readings in presence of phone speakers on
a different surface are shown in Appendix Figure 6. We
observed that the maximum variation in gyroscope readings
hovered around 0.006 rad/s for x axis (Appendix Figure
6a) and around 0.005 rad/s for y and z axis (Appendix
Figure 6b and 6c). The accelerometer analysis shows us that
maximum variations in its readings are consistent in presence
and absence of speech at around 0.1 m/s2 for x, y and z axis
(Appendix Figure 6d, 6e and 6f). These comparisons lead us
to believe that phone speakers may not have any profound
effect on smartphone sensors.
E. Motion Sensors vs. Human Speech
1) The Human-Normal Scenario: We recruited 10 human
subjects (ages 20-40; 5 males, 5 females; graduate and above
education level) for our study that was approved by our
University’s IRB. The participation was voluntary and the
participants could withdraw any time. Our sample size, while
small in size, is adequate for judging motion sensor behavior
in presence of live human speech as we also provide for
two scenarios (normal and loud) for covering possible cases
that may occur in real world. All the subjects were healthy
(reported on their own accord) and did not suffer from any
ailments that affected their vocal chords. Each subject was
asked to recite the list of words that is used in [24]. The
subjects were seated in a quiet room on a chair, and were not
in physical contact with the table. The smartphone was placed
face-up on the table and was running the same application as
in previous experiments. The subjects were asked to take extra
care not to touch or move the table during the entire duration
of the experiment as to not affect the motion sensors. The
subjects were asked to go through the word list by speaking
each word in a normal conversational tone into the phone at
a close distance of 10cm.
Frequency Domain Analysis: In the frequency domain, the
spectrum of the recorded human speech by gyroscope does
not reveal any effects on the sensor readings along x, y and z
axis of rotation as per Appendix Figure 8a, 8b and 8c. Similar
pattern was found in the accelerometer readings as per Figure
8d, 8e and 8f.
Time Domain Analysis: The observations for Human-Normal
scenario are depicted in Figure 7 for gyroscope and accelerom-
eter. We observe that maximum observed range in gyrosocpe
readings during speech is approximately 0.004 and 0.006
rad/s for x axis (except outlier samples 17 that is around

tone signal (130-200Hz) generated from laptop. Faint energy
signatures (circled in red) can be seen on the spectrum
indicating vibration effect produced due to the audio signal.
in the motion sensors. Thus, we believe that a limit to the
actual sound volume produced and the inability to correctly
reproduce low frequency sounds severely limits the capability
of the laptop speakers to affect
the motions sensors in a
smartphone. Since our time domain analysis in the loudspeaker
setup failed to reveal any observable effect on the gyroscope
for the speech signals, laptop speakers being less powerful may
similarly be unable to reproduce any observable response in
the gyroscope sensor. Since accelerometer did show some hints
of the multi-tone signal (Figure 5) on frequency spectrum, a
more sophisticated frequency domain analysis [1] could be
used for further investigation of the presence of speech signal
in accelerometer readings.
Based upon our ﬁndings in Laptop-Same-Surface scenario,
we believe that Laptop-Different-Surface scenario would pro-
duce similar results. In Laptop-Different-Surface scenario, the
laptop is placed on a different surface from the smartphone
and the laptop generates speech signals. Since there exists an
air gap between the sensors and the source of speech signals in
Laptop-Different-Surface scenario in contrast to Laptop-Same-
Surface scenario, attenuation would be greater for the speech
signals. In addition, the inability of Macbook Air speakers to
produce the multi-tone signal above 67db, and male (female)
speech signals above 80db (71db), it makes it unlikely for
laptop produced speech signals to have any noticeable effect in
Laptop-Different-Surface scenario (due to the fact that no such
effect was observed in Loudspeaker-Different-Surface scenario
even with loudspeakers producing sound at 99db). For laptops
that are able to output high quality loud sounds, comparable
to a loudspeaker, we believe it would behavior in a similar
manner as Loudspeaker-Same-Surface scenario if placed on
same surface or Loudspeaker-Different-Surface scenario when
placed on different surface.
D. Motion Sensors vs. Phone’s Speakers
To examine the behavior of motion sensors against phone
speakers, we used an iPhoneTM4S phone speaker and played
the word list from the word data set [24], as described in the
previous section. We set the volume of the phone speaker at
the maximum value to achieve most response in the motion
sensor readings. The resulting setup is similar to Loudspeaker-

Fig. 6: Comparison of sensor behavior under ambient locations and in presence of live human speech (loud). Maximum variance
in sensor readings (in absence of speech) at quiet locations 1, 2, 3, 4 is plotted along side maximum variance in sensor readings
(in presence of speech) to determine the effect of speech on sensors. The blue line (maximum variance in presence of speech)
closely follows rest of the lines (that represent maximum variance in absence of speech) indicating similar behavior of sensors
in quiet locations and against loud human voice.
0.009 rad/s), 0.003 and 0.009 rad/s for y axis, and 0.003
and 0.007 rad/s for the z axis (Figure 7a, 7b and 7c). This
behavior follows similar to sensor readings taken in absence
of speech. For accelerometer, these values are approximately
0.1 m/s2 for x and y axis, and 0.18 m/s2 for z axis (Figure
7d, 7e and 7f).
2) The Human-Loud Scenario: This scenario is similar
to Human-Normal scenario with same subjects and same
equipment and location being used. The only change in this
scenario from Human-Normal scenario is that the subjects
were asked to shout as loud as they could instead of speaking
normally into a smartphone placed on the table. The word list
is kept same and the instructions to avoid any physical contact
with the table were followed.
Frequency Domain Analysis: The spectrum of recorded hu-
man speech, spoken as loud as possible, by gyroscope does
not reveal any effects on the sensor readings along x, y and z
axis of rotation as per Appendix Figure 7a, 7b and 7c. We ﬁnd
similar behavior in the accelerometer readings as per Figure
7d, 7e and 7f.
Time Domain Analysis: We calculated maximum observed
range for the sensor readings in Human-Loud scenario. Our
ﬁndings, as shown in Figure 6a, 6b and 6c, indicate that the
metrics for gyroscope are around 0.005 rad/s for x axis. The
values for y and z axis are around 0.005 rad/s. Overall, these
numbers are very similar to our observations under speech free
environment at locations 1, 2, 3 and 4 in the plot. The values
from accelerometer are around 0.1 for x and y axis (Figure 6d
and 6e) and 0.2 for z axis as shown in Figure 6f (with samples
43, 94 and 97 being the most obvious outliers possibly due to
physical interaction of the user with the phone). These results
for accelerometer indicate similar behavior as in speech free
environment depicted by readings from Location 1, 2, 3 and
4 in Figure 6 and hence serve to consolidate our conclusion
from the frequency domain analysis.
VII. SUMMARY AND FURTHER INSIGHTS
Recalling the three factors (source of speech, audio transfer
medium and sound pressure level) that are important in de-
ciding whether a noticeable effect would be produced by the
speech on the sensors, we pick each of the tested scenarios,
summarize the obtained results and present the insights learned
