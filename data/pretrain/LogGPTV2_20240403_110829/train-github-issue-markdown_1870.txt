In some PRs for adding validation to functions: #24924 or #25026, there will
be double validation, by the function and another by the estimator.
@adrinjalali and I share the same concern about keeping constraints in sync
between the function and the estimator: #24924 (comment), #25026 (comment).
The test for validation is very strict about including a constraint for every
parameter. I see the purpose of having this strictness is such that when a new
parameter is added, then a constraint is also included.
I propose adding a `parameters_to_validate` to `validate_params` which is a
collection of strings that states which parameters should be validated. This
way when a new parameter is added, the default is to add a constraint for the
new parameter, but it can be ignored by adding it to the
`parameters_to_validate` list.
