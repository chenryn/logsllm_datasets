# Feature request
A related conversation to this feature happened here #9524 (comment)
if i use a headless CMS (even wordpress or graphcms or whatever), the asset
url is used in the static html.
There are two preferences here - that asset links be used as such.  
But more likely - download the asset, build the html (link to it locally) and
then layer a CDN in front. This is the far more acceptable practice.
This also ties in very well with using deployment systems like Netlify - which
have a far, far more suitable globally available infrastructure than something
like DatoCMS or Graphcms. So if im using Netlify as deployment, i would want
everything to be served from Netlify domain and let it work its magic.
We understand that this increases build times. This is ok for our usecase
where we use a CMS just for the sake of usability, but deployment has to
follow guidelines of compliance (geographic restriction of assets, etc) so we
would like the entire build to be inside the export folder. This would mean
that CMS that have CDN in front of it (e.g. datocms and www.datocms-assets.com
which is Imgix) may not be ideal.
There are tons of similar requests.
