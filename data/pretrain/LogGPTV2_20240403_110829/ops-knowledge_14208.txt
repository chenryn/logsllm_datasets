User: From Python's doc, os.listdir() returns 

a list containing the names of the entries in the directory given by
  path. The list is in arbitrary order.

What I'm wondering is, is this arbitrary order always the same/deterministic? (from one machine to another, or through time, provided the content of the folder is the same) 
Edit: I am not trying to make it deterministic, nor do I want to use this. I was just wondering (for example, what does the order depend on?)
Assistant: It will probably depend on file system internals. On a typical unix machine, I would expect the order of items in the return value from os.listdir to be in the order of the details in the directory's "dirent" data structure (which, again, depends on the specifics of the file system). 
I would not expect a directory to have the same ordering over time, if files are added and deleted. 
I would not expect two "directories with the same contents" on two different machines to have a consistent ordering, unless specific care was taken when copying from one to the other.
Depending on a variety of specifics, the ordering may change on a single machine, over time, without any explicit changes to the directory, as various file system compacting operations take place (although I don't think I've seen a file system that would actually do this, but it's definitely something that could be done).
In short, if you want any sort of ordering you can reason about, sort the results, somehow. Then you have the guarantee that the ordering will be whatever your sorting imposes.
