User: How to deploy clusters on multiple servers and ensure system scalability and load balancing?
Assistant: 1. Load Balancer: The load balancer is used to implement load balancing among different servers for user requests, thereby improving the availability and scalability of the system. The load balancer can detect the load status of the server, and forward the request to the server with the least load, so as to avoid the system crash caused by the overload of a single server. 2. Distributed Architecture (Distributed Architecture): A system built with a distributed architecture can be distributed among multiple servers, and each server bears part of the system load, thereby ensuring the scalability and load balancing of the system. The micro-service architecture can be used to split the system into different micro-services for distributed deployment, and each micro-service calls each other through APIs to achieve high availability and high scalability of the system. 3. Database Cluster: For systems that need to store a large amount of data, using a database cluster is a very good method. The database cluster can disperse and store data on multiple servers, so as to achieve fast data read and write and fault tolerance. If the system load and data storage are clearly separated, the data can be stored on a dedicated database server, and then transmitted to the application server through a network connection. 4. Optimize Architecture: By optimizing the architecture, the burden on the server can be reduced, and the performance and scalability of the system can be improved. Use caching, data preprocessing, lazy loading and other technologies in the application to reduce the number of database accesses and network traffic. Resource management, connection pool configuration, thread pool configuration, etc. are performed on the server side to improve the concurrent processing capability of the server.
