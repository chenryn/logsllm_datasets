# Environment
    Windows build number: Version 10.0.18363.449
    Windows Terminal version (if applicable): Version: 0.6.2951.0
    Any other software? Git for Windows 2.24.0
    Powershell core 6.2.3
# Steps to reproduce
I am using WT with PSC. Inside it, I issue `git push` command. It require me
to input account and password. Instead of typing them manually, I tried to
paste the password.
I tried two things:
  1. using the right mouse button
  2. using Ctrl-V
# Expected behavior
I expect that the password text would be pasted and accepted by `git` command
# Actual behavior
Nothing happens. `git` does not receive the pasted text.
Please note, I verified that I can paste text inside WT itself. Both right
mouse button and Ctrl-V options worked. The issue is somewhere in the
interaction of WT, PSC, and git. If I am using CMD only or PSC only, I can
successfully paste the text and git accepts the input.
