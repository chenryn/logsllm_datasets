I am able to run the development web server in Google App Engine Launcher without any issues. However, I encounter a problem when trying to stop the server. When I press the "Stop" button, nothing happens. No new entries are added to the logs after pressing "Stop," and I am unable to close the launcher. The only way to close the launcher is by using the Task Manager.

Interestingly, when I use `dev_appserver.py myapp` via the command line, I can successfully stop the server with `Ctrl+C`.

For your information, I am operating behind a proxy.

**Response:**

I have also experienced this issue, and it seems to be related to the specific application being run. If you are confident that the application itself is functioning correctly, the problem might be due to the server being overburdened in some way. I strongly recommend adding more detailed logging to your code to help identify any potential issues that may be causing this behavior. This should provide more insight into what is happening in the log console. 

I hope this helps.
