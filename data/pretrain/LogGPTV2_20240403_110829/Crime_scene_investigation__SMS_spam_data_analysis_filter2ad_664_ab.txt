In subsection we investigate the ratio between the num-
ber of received and transmitted messages (response ratio).
Although spammers receive a lot of messages, the response
ratio is very diﬀerent to that of a legitimate user. Figure
3 plots an example for a randomly selected spammer and
legitimate user (with a post-paid family plan). The number
of messages is equally normalized in both cases.
In the case of legitimate users, generally messages are sent
in response to a previous message in a sequential way. There-
fore, the response ratio close to 1. For spammers the amount
of MT SMSs is proportionally very small to the number of
transmitted messages. Therefore, the response ratio is close
to 0.
3.2.2 Message timing and time series
This sub-section investigates timing characteristics of
spam text messages. Due to the large load of SMSs spam-
mers send, the intervals between two consecutive messages
are short. On the other hand, both legitimate customers
and M2M systems send messages less frequently. This can
be observed in Figure 4a, which shows the distribution of
the intervals between two sequential messages.
Figure 4b plots the distribution of the inter-message time
entropy. Usually, spammers send messages at a constant
rate using a computer. Legitimate users are less predictable.
One cannot accurately estimate when the next text message
will be sent given the time of the previous one. Inter-SMS
intervals for spammers are less random resulting in low en-
tropy values. On the other hand, intervals between two le-
gitimate messages are random, with higher entropy.
Messaging activities of certain M2M devices are pre-
scheduled. For example, smart grid meters report mea-
surements periodically. Other applications, such as park-
ing meters and ATMs, have communications initiated by
humans. A message is sent each time a parking receipt is
issued. Therefore, we observe a large number of M2M con-
nected devices with a low value of the entropy, overlapping
with spammers, and some with a higher value of the entropy,
overlapping with legitimate users.
Beyond the large messaging load at a high frequency, we
investigate what strategy spammers follow to transmit text
messages over time. Figure 5 plots a typical example of the

terns of spammers to those of legitimate customers, both
cell-phone users and M2M devices.
In all the ﬁgures throughout the paper, legitimate cell-
phone users, M2M systems and spammers are represented
in green, blue and red, respectively.
This section is organized in ﬁve subsections. We start
with Subsection 3.1, which brieﬂy describes the character-
istics of the accounts of message abusers. Subsection 3.2
investigates the SMS spam traﬃc in general and Subsection
3.3 studies the location information of both spammers and
their targets. Finally, Subsection 3.4 discusses tools used in
messaging abuse and voice and data traﬃc are described in
Subsection 3.5.
3.1 Spammer sketch: Account information
Detailed analysis of Call Detail Records indicates that
the great majority of spammers (99.64%) are using pre-paid
accounts. As the GSMA Messaging Anti-Abuse Working
Group investigated [8], spammers purchase bulk SIM cards
with unlimited messaging plans. These SIM cards are con-
stantly switched to circumvent detection schemes and reduce
the number of messages sent per day. Also they discard them
once an account is canceled and continue spamming with a
new one.
The average age of an illegitimate account is 7 to 11 days.
This indicates that message abuse accounts are canceled
rapidly on average. The account age of a legitimate user
is often several months to a couple years.
3.2 The Crime: Messaging Abuse
Figures 1a and 1b compare the empirical histograms for
the number of text messages sent and received by legitimate
accounts, M2M and spammers. Intuitively, spammers gen-
erate a large load of messages. The number of spam SMSs
is two orders of magnitude higher than that of legitimate
user text messages and one order of magnitude above the
number of messages from networked appliances.
Spammers not only send but also receive two orders of
magnitude more messages than legitimate customers do. Al-
though this behavior is, at ﬁrst, unexpected, it can be ex-
plained by the nature of SMS spam messages. Upon recep-
tion of an unrequested text message, users sometimes at-
tempt to reply to opt-out from the advertised service. Fur-
thermore, actual spam messages often attempt to trick the

number of messages per minute sent over the span of one day.
The results indicate that spammers focus the illegitimate
activity during the day time. This might be to minimize
the annoyance caused to recipients and lower the chances
to be reported to spam detections services such as the 7726
service [1].
3.2.3 Message content
The analysis of the content of spam messages is out of the
scope of this paper. However, we oﬀer a brief glimpse of some
of our ﬁndings. Querying the Cloudmark 7726 data-base of
user reported spam messages [1], we access the content of
the messages sent by positively identiﬁed spammers. Based
on this data we determine that spammers based in far apart
locations sometimes ﬂood messages with exactly the same
content. This could be an indication of either collaboration
or a set of common sources both for revenue and content.
3.3 The Scene of the Crime
The next step of our analysis is to determine the geo-
graphical distribution of messaging abuse. We aim to ﬁnd
out where spammers base their activities and where the tar-
gets of such SMS traﬃc are located. Finally, we attempt to
determine whether spammers are mobile or not.
3.3.1 Location of spammers and their targets
Figure 6 shows the locations of accounts identiﬁed for
messaging abuse activities during the one year period under
analysis. Data indicates that spammers are mainly located
in California, speciﬁcally in the counties of Sacramento and
Orange and in the surroundings of Los Angeles. Other no-
table sources of spam are observed in the New York/New
Jersey/Long Island areas and in Miami Beach. Smaller
sources of messaging abuse are found in Illinois, Michigan,
North Carolina and Texas. Note that this does not im-

ply that spam will always come from only these areas, but
gives an indication of the non-uniform origin of SMS spam
messages. Messaging abuse in the SMS world appears to
originate from a few locations over the US.
Figures 7a and 7b show the recipients of SMS messages
sent out in one day by a randomly selected spammer and
legitimate customer respectively. Each map plots the source
(spammer or legitimate user) with a pin and individual re-
cipients with a diamond. Note that we only have location
information for customers (recipients) subscribed to the cel-
lular operator under analysis. The legitimate customer com-
municates only with a small number of contacts. Most of the
recipients for the given user belong to the local area (i.e. the
area around the subscriber’s home) as well as several other
locations (e.g. areas where the subscriber works, used to
live or where friends and relatives reside). In contrast, the
recipients of spam text messages appear to be distributed

the case of SMS spammers is obvious. Both M2M systems
and cell-phone users cluster around the bottom-left area of
the graph. One can notice in the ﬁgure some M2M appli-
ances sending up to 20000 messages to 1 single destination.
This is a common situation in, for example, security or mon-
itoring M2M applications in which reports are timely sent
to a controlling server.
The relation between the ratio (number of message recip-
ients)/(number of messages sent) and the average number
of area codes reached by day is plotted in Figure 8d. Cell-
phone users congregate at the bottom left of the Figure,
with low destinations-to-messages ratio and a small set of
contacted area codes. A great majority of spammers exhibit
the opposite behavior, clustering on the top-right corner of
the ﬁgure. Nevertheless, a substantial number of spammers
with a diﬀerent behavior is identiﬁed.
The spammers aggregated on the bottom-right corner of
Figure 8d are message abusers that target very speciﬁc ge-
ographical regions. These accounts still send thousands of
messages per day with a ratio close to one destination per
message. However, the number of targeted area codes is in
the range of the number of recipients from legitimate cell-
phone users.
3.3.2 Do spammers move? Yes, they do!
In terms of mobility, one expects spammers to not move.
Therefore, all messages should be handled by one single base
station. Figure 9 plots the distribution of the number of base
stations (Location Area Code - Cell ID, LACCI) a device
is connected to in one day. Legitimate customers display
a highly mobile behavior, with most of the users visiting at
most 30 cells sectors. This number depends on many factors,
such as the length of the daily commute. The distribution
exhibits a long tail with a minority of highly mobile cell-
phone users.
Spammers, as expected, are much less mobile. They
still appear to traverse an average of about 4 cells or sec-
tors. This might be due to the following reasons. On one
hand, spammers might mount their equipment on a vehicle
and drive around the area in an attempt to misguide de-
tection schemes looking at device mobility. On the other
hand, especially in the case of aircards, the hardware often
connects to the network by means of a Third Generation
(3G) technology. 3G wireless networks in the operator un-
der study are based on Wideband Code Multiple Division
Access (WCDMA). In such technology, the receiver can be
physically connected to up to 6 sectors at the same time,
combining the signal at the RAKE receiver [22]. Depending
on the channel conditions and fading, the serving base sta-
tion might ﬂuctuate throughout this list of 6 LACCIs. This
would result in CDR records from the same static device
appearing to come from up to 6 diﬀerent sectors.
Note that, though, based on the IMEI, we are able to de-
termine the actual hardware used by the spammer to send
messages. In the case of GSM devices, a cell-phone or cel-
lular modem is at all time connected to, at most, one cell
tower [6]. Camping on base stations miles away from each
other deﬁnitively indicates movement.
The distribution of recipients’ area codes for M2M is
mixed. The majority of appliances are quasi-static, with
most of their messaging load being handled by a couple of
sectors. This corresponds to non-mobility M2M applications

(b)
Figure 7: Example area code messaging pattern for
a spammer (a) and a legitimate customers (b)
uniformly over the US population (the spammer sends mes-
sages to most area codes).
Figure 8a plots the distribution of the number of unique
area codes contacted in one day by spammers, legitimate
customers and M2M systems. Spammers are character-
ized by messaging a large number of area codes, always
greater than those of cell-phone users and M2M. We ob-
serve, though, a small amount of spammers contacting a
reduced number of area codes. Most M2M devices contact
numbers just within one area code.
Independent of the number of unique area codes, it is in-
teresting to know how often these area codes are contacted.
Figure 8b plots the entropy of these area codes. In this con-
text, entropy stands for the randomness of the connections
in one day. A low value of the entropy implies that this
speciﬁc user contacts repeatedly the same area codes. On
the other hand, a high value of the entropy indicates a user
that sends messages to a more random set of area codes.
Network enabled appliances report to speciﬁc servers and
data collectors or, in the case of user applications (i.e. home
monitoring), to a predeﬁned set of cell-phones. Therefore,
the entropy is the lowest. Spammers show a much more
random set of SMS abuse targets with a high entropy. Fur-
ther analysis of the spam data identiﬁes a messaging strat-
egy that consists of messaging numbers in ascendent order.
Thus, sending bulk SMSs to each area code sequentially.
The aforementioned results are summarized in Figure 8c,
which plots the correlation between the number of sent mes-

as ﬂeet control/monitoring and asset tracking.
The ﬁnal answer to the question is found in Figure 10,
which plots the observed locations of a randomly chosen
spammer on the map of an undisclosed area. The legend in-
dicates the length on the map that corresponds to 1 mile and
2km. Based on this information, it seems that certain spam-
mers move while sending illegitimate SMSs. In the case of
the example, this spammer is observed in the vicinity of cell
sites as far as 4 miles apart. Computing the longest distance
between the cell sites every spammer camps on indicates a
maximum displacement of 15 miles.
3.4 The weapons of choice
Observations of the IMEI from CDR gives us an insight
on the kind of device used to connect to the cellular network.
Analyzing the TAC data from known and already canceled
spamming accounts, we observe that an impressive 83% of
the spammers identiﬁed in one year is sent from one of the
top ﬁve identiﬁed devices. About 65% of the spammers in
the US send messages with the top device.

Devices used by spammers are anonymized and ranked.
The top 5 most frequently used devices are listed below.
1. USB Modem/Aircard A1
2. Feature mobile-phone M1
3. Feature mobile-phone M2
4. USB Modem/Aircard A2
5. USB Modem/Aircard A3
Thus spammers often rely on modems and aircards con-
nected to a PC via USB interface. A1, A2 and A3 belong to
this category. In parallel, spammers also use common fea-
ture phones as cellular modem. This might be done in order
to mislead detection schemes by making messages appear to
be originated at a legitimate cell-phone. Several resources
can be found online with detailed instructions on how to re-
ﬂash typical feature phones from most manufacturers with
custom ﬁrmware [2] [5] [4].
Note that these devices are legitimate hardware that
spammers use for SMS abuse. All of them are used in legit-
imate applications, which provides cover for the spam. This
is why we anonymize the make and model of these devices.
