I migrated to the latest Blender exporter, had error on my project file which
previously worked. I started a new blender file and found the same error
persists.
To reproduce:
  1. create a new blender file
  2. create cube
  3. apply blender material
  4. apply blender texture (point at any image)
  5. Export to JSON
  6. Check box titled "Textures"
  7. Error when saving:

KeyError: 'repeat'
(note that by changing the texture "Image Mapping" to something other than
'repeat' simply alters the key error to whatever you selected)
  * Blender version 2.74, 2.76, 2.78 (others not tested)
  * Exporter says it is version "1.5" but I know previous versions were also still called "1.5". I used the Master version from 2017-03-03 (today).
##### OS
  * All of them
