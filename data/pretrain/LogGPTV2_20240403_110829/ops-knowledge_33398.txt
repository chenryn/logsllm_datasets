User: Is output buffering enabled by default in Python's interpreter for sys.stdout?
If the answer is positive, what are all the ways to disable it?
Suggestions so far:

Use the -u command line switch
Wrap sys.stdout in an object that flushes after every write
Set PYTHONUNBUFFERED env var
sys.stdout = os.fdopen(sys.stdout.fileno(), 'w', 0)

Is there any other way to set some global flag in sys/sys.stdout programmatically during execution?
Assistant: Yes, it is enabled by default. You can disable it by using the -u option on the command line when calling python.
