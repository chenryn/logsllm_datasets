When using regular expressions that include a Unicode category matcher, an error is thrown, even though the same expressions work correctly in Node.js and Chrome. 

**Example:**
```javascript
"0a".match(/\p{L}/u);
```

**Expected output:**
```javascript
[ 'a', index: 1, input: '0a', groups: undefined ]
```

**Actual output:**
```javascript
:1:5
"0a".match(/\p{L}/u)
     ^
Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression: /\p{L}/: Invalid property name

```

I discussed this issue on Gitter, and it was suspected to be due to the lack of ICU (International Components for Unicode) support in the environment.
