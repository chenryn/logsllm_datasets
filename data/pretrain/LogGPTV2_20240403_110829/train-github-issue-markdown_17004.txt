Regular expressions that include a Unicode category matcher throw an error,
while they work fine in Node and in Chrome.
Example:
    "0a".match(/\p{L}/u);
Expected output:
    [ 'a', index: 1, input: '0a', groups: undefined ]
Actual output:
    :1:5
    "0a".match(/\p{L}/u)
         ^
    Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression: /\p{L}/: Invalid property name

I brought this up on Gitter and it was suspected to be due to the lack of ICU.
