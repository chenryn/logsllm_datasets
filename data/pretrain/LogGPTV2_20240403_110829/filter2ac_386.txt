### Title: Botconf 2016 - Visiting the Bear’s Den

**Sednit, also known as Fancy Bear, APT28, or Sofacy, is a sophisticated cyber-espionage group that has been active since at least 2004. Their primary objective is to steal confidential information from specific high-value targets. Over the past two years, Sednit's activity has significantly increased, with a particular focus on attacks against foreign affairs ministries and embassies worldwide.**

**Technically, Sednit is one of the most advanced espionage groups in operation. They have developed a complex software ecosystem comprising dozens of different components and regularly deploy zero-day exploits. Additionally, they are highly adaptive, quickly integrating newly published techniques into their toolkit.**

**This presentation summarizes the results of a two-year investigation into Sednit, during which we uncovered and analyzed numerous pieces of their malware. We will delve into the technical details of some of their most impressive components:**

- **DOWNDELPH**: A mysterious downloader used in rare cases, featuring advanced persistence methods. Our research revealed a previously undocumented Windows bootkit and a rootkit that both drop this component.
  
- **XTUNNEL**: A heavily obfuscated network proxy tool that transforms an infected machine into a pivot point for accessing computers that are otherwise unreachable from the internet. XTUNNEL uses a custom encrypted protocol and is a key asset in Sednit's post-infection toolkit.

- **XAGENT**: The flagship Sednit backdoor, available for Windows, Linux, and iOS. Built as a modular framework around a "kernel," XAGENT allows for the creation of flexible backdoors capable of switching between various network protocols.

- **SEDKIT**: A comprehensive exploit kit that can deliver zero-day or revamped exploits based on the target's configuration.

**Our tracking efforts also provided significant insights into Sednit's post-infection operations, which include the use of Mimikatz and various custom hacking tools.**
