Question: A software module is updated to include a new function 'executeWorkflow' which throws a custom exception 'WorkflowException'. The existing error handling logic is designed to catch generic exceptions. Which of the following is a potential consequence of not updating the exception handling logic to specifically address 'WorkflowException'?
"A": "The generic catch block will handle 'WorkflowException' in a generic way, potentially missing specific cleanup or compensation logic required for 'WorkflowException'.",
"B": "The generic catch block will cause a compilation error, forcing the developer to handle 'WorkflowException' specifically.",
"C": "The 'WorkflowException' will be propagated up the call stack, triggering the default uncaught exception handler of the runtime environment.",
"D": "The generic catch block will automatically handle 'WorkflowException' with the most appropriate error handling logic predefined for it."
Answer: A
