## Abstract
As mobile Internet environments become more prevalent, there is a growing need to adapt peer-to-peer (P2P) operations for mobile hosts. This paper presents an empirical study of BitTorrent performance in a commercial WiMAX network. We investigate the impact of handovers on BitTorrent performance, the behavior of BitTorrent peers in terms of connectivity, stability, and capability, and the protocol's behavior under user mobility. Our findings indicate that BitTorrent for mobile users is characterized by poor peer connectivity, short download session times, low download throughput, negligible upload contributions, and high signaling overhead.

## 1. Introduction
Over the past decade, P2P file-sharing applications have generated a significant portion of Internet traffic. With the increasing use of portable devices and higher wireless link capacities, P2.P applications are expected to see increased usage in mobile networks. By 2014, mobile P2P traffic is projected to reach approximately 277 petabytes per month, accounting for about 10% of global mobile Internet traffic [1].

WiMAX and 3GPP LTE networks are emerging as candidates for next-generation mobile networks, aiming to provide broadband link bandwidth and mobility support. However, mobile users in these networks face challenges such as link quality fluctuations and handovers. Therefore, mobile P2P applications must address issues like substantial link dynamics due to fading, disruptions during handovers, and imbalanced link conditions between mobile and wireline users.

Current P2P applications are designed with the assumption of high and stable link bandwidth, typical of wireline hosts. Thus, measuring and analyzing how current P2P protocols perform in mobile environments can provide a foundation for designing new mobile P2P protocols. This motivates our study of BitTorrent in mobile WiMAX networks.

Despite numerous service-oriented measurement studies in real WiMAX networks, no prior work has focused on P2P performance in WiMAX. Some studies have proposed new P2P schemes without empirical validation. For example, Huang et al. [6] proposed a hierarchical P2P scheme but only conducted simulations. Wu et al. [7] designed a network architecture for mobile P2P in maritime environments, relying on flooding, which is inefficient in mobile P2P scenarios. Hsieh and Sivakumar [8] discussed cellular network support for P2P communications but did not conduct empirical studies.

Recently, Kim et al. [9] conducted preliminary P2P measurements in a commercial WiMAX network, focusing on traffic metrics, control overhead, and peer performance. Our study extends this work by specifically examining the impact of handovers, peer connectivity and stability, and control signaling delay. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to conduct a comprehensive empirical study of BitTorrent performance in mobile WiMAX networks, with the following contributions:
- Empirical measurement of BitTorrent performance for mobile users in a commercial WiMAX network, with log data shared publicly.
- Analysis of how handovers degrade BitTorrent performance, showing average reductions in throughput, connected peers, and active peers.
- Investigation of BitTorrent behavior under user mobility, including connectivity, download/upload duration, and throughput.
- Analysis of BitTorrent signaling overhead over the WiMAX network, highlighting inefficiencies due to long RTTs and link instability.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the measurement settings and test routes. Section 3 examines the impact of handovers on BitTorrent performance. Sections 4 and 5 analyze the application-level performance of BitTorrent users and the efficiency of BitTorrent signaling, respectively. Concluding remarks are provided in Section 6.

## 2. Experiment Description

### 2.1 Measurement Settings
We conducted measurements in KT’s mobile WiMAX network in Seoul, Korea, which had over 300,000 subscribers as of March 2010. Each base station (BS) in the WiMAX network offers an aggregated throughput of approximately 30 to 50 Mbps and typically covers an area with a radius of 1 to 5 km. The channel condition and bit rate vary significantly depending on the distance between the BS and the subscriber station (SS). When an SS crosses the boundary between two BSs, it performs a handover (HO), which affects BitTorrent download/upload. Time-varying link conditions, inter-cell interference, and HOs adversely affect BitTorrent performance.

For our measurements, we used three laptop computers, each equipped with a WiMAX modem (one KWM-U1000 and two KWM-U1800s [10]). An additional desktop computer was connected to the 100 Mbps Ethernet in the campus network of Seoul National University for comparison. We modified the open-source BitTorrent software, Vuze [11], to record logs every 0.5 seconds, capturing peer lists and download/upload rates. WinDump was used to capture packet headers, while Wireshark and TCPTrace were used for trace analysis. The XRO7000 toolkit [12] was employed to monitor WiMAX link layer activities, such as signal strength and HO messages.

### 2.2 Test Routes
Based on similar measurement studies [2][4][5][9], we considered three scenarios for WiMAX hosts:
1. **Stationary**: An SS located inside a building on the university campus, covered by a single WiMAX BS and a few repeaters. The distance between the SS and the BS is about 800 meters, with stable but not strong received signal strength.
2. **Subway**: A subway route from Sadang station to Myeong-dong Station, covering about 12 km and taking approximately 20 minutes. HOs occur at each of the 10 subway stations along the route.
3. **Bus**: A bus route from Seoul National University to Seoul Railway Station, covering about 11 km and taking approximately 30 minutes.

We selected a popular 400 MB video file, a 25-minute sitcom, with at least 300 seeds participating in the BitTorrent network. Experiments were conducted four times over four days in March 2010, with four hosts (Ethernet, stationary, subway, and bus) starting to download the same file simultaneously in each run.

## 3. Impacts of Handovers
WiMAX uses a break-and-make HO approach, leading to noticeable disruptions in throughput. We traced all HOs by observing the IEEE 802.16e MAC frames: MOB MSHO REQ (indicating the beginning of a HO) and HO RNG SUCCESS (indicating the end of the HO). We then averaged relevant metrics at one-second intervals. The changes in metrics over time (within 5 seconds before and after the HO) are shown in Fig. 1, where the vertical line indicates the HO occurrence.

In the bus case, the carrier-to-interference ratio (CINR) dropped below 0 dB before HOs, suggesting that 0 dB may be the threshold for triggering HOs in KT’s WiMAX network. During HOs, packet transmissions are disrupted, leading to retransmission timeouts and reduced TCP congestion windows. In the bus case, the download throughput nearly halved after HOs and continued to decrease due to slow TCP congestion control recovery. Additionally, the number of actively transmitting peers decreased significantly before and after HOs. In the subway case, the effect of HOs was less severe, with increased RTT and reduced download throughput around HOs.

Table 1 shows the average values of each metric before and after HOs. On average, a HO reduces the RTT, throughput, number of connected peers, and number of active peers by 7.3%, 32.4%, 1.4%, and 14.9% in the bus case, and by 4.7%, 14.7%, 3.5%, and 0.5% in the subway case, respectively. TCP transmissions are most significantly impacted by HOs.

## 4. BitTorrent Dynamics for Mobility in WiMAX
To evaluate the behavior of BitTorrent protocols with other peers from a WiMAX host's perspective, we define the following terms, illustrated in Fig. 2:
- **Connection Session (CS)**: Starts with the establishment of a connection with a particular peer and ends when the peer is disconnected. If the host reconnects to the same peer after 1 second, they are counted as separate CSs. This term indicates peer connectivity.
- **Download/Upload Session (DS/US)**: Refers to the download/upload duration during a single CS. A DS/US ends if there is no packet transmission for longer than 1 second. These terms show download/upload stability.
- **Download/Upload Traffic (DT/UT)**: Refers to the downloaded/uploaded traffic load in bytes during a single DS/US. These terms indicate download/upload capability.

A WiMAX host may connect to (and be disconnected from) the same peer multiple times. We define a peer's aggregated CS, aggregated DS/US, and aggregated DT/UT by summing CSs, DSs/USs, and DTs/UTs with the same peer. All CSs and DSs/USs are normalized to the total download time of each case for comparison. The total download times are 243.28s, 1208.05s, 1326.44s, and 1964.86s in the Ethernet, stationary, subway, and bus cases, respectively.

Disconnections from other peers are caused by:
- **Bad link conditions** due to fading and mobility (passive disconnection).
- **BitTorrent operations** due to lack of incentives (active disconnection).

We analyze CSs and DSs/USs of WiMAX hosts caused by passive disconnections to observe how the WiMAX network impacts BitTorrent performance.

### 4.1 Peer Connectivity
A TCP connection of a WiMAX host with a peer will be maintained until it is actively closed by the peer's BitTorrent operation or passively disconnected due to bad link conditions. 

Fig. 2 illustrates the distribution of individual connection sessions (CSs) for different scenarios. The results show that the WiMAX network significantly affects BitTorrent peer connectivity, with more frequent disconnections in the bus and subway cases compared to the stationary and Ethernet cases.

## 5. Conclusion
Our study provides a comprehensive empirical analysis of BitTorrent performance in mobile WiMAX networks. We observed that handovers significantly degrade BitTorrent performance, with noticeable reductions in throughput, connected peers, and active peers. The dynamic nature of mobile environments, characterized by frequent disconnections and unstable links, further exacerbates these issues. Future work should focus on developing adaptive P2P protocols that can better handle the challenges of mobile networks.
