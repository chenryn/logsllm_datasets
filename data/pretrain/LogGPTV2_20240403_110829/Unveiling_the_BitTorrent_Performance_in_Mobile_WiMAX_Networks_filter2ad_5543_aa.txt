Abstract. As mobile Internet environments are becoming widespread,
how to revamp peer-to-peer (P2P) operations for mobile hosts is gaining
more attention. In this paper, we carry out empirical measurement of
BitTorrent users in a commercial WiMAX network. We investigate how
handovers in WiMAX networks impact the BitTorrent performance, how
BitTorrent peers perform from the aspects of connectivity, stability and
capability, and how the BitTorrent protocol behaves depending on user
mobility. We observe that the drawbacks of BitTorrent for mobile users
are characterized by poor connectivity among peers, short download ses-
sion times, small download throughput, negligible upload contributions,
and high signaling overhead.
Keywords: Mobile WiMAX, BitTorrent, Measurement.
1 Introduction
Over the past decade, peer-to-peer (P2P) ﬁle sharing applications have generated
dominant Internet traﬃc. Also, more and more users are accessing the Internet
in mobile environments due to the advances of portable devices and the increase
of wireless link capacity. These trends will lead to the increasing usage of P2P
applications in mobile networks; mobile P2P traﬃc is expected to be about 277
petabytes per month, 10% of the world’s mobile Internet traﬃc by 2014 [1].
WiMAX and 3GPP LTE networks are gaining momentum as candidates for
the next generation mobile networks, aiming to provide broadband link band-
width and mobility support. However, mobile users in these networks will experi-
ence link quality ﬂuctuations and handovers. Therefore, mobile P2P applications
should address the following drawbacks: substantial link dynamics due to fad-
ing, disruptions during handovers, and the imbalance of link conditions between
mobile and wireline users.
Current P2P applications are however designed by assuming wireline hosts
that avail themselves of high and stable link bandwidth. Therefore measurement
and analysis of how the current P2P protocols behave in mobile environments

can be a foundation for new mobile P2P protocol designs, which motivates our
measurement study of BitTorrent in mobile WiMAX networks.
Even though numerous service-oriented measurement studies, e.g., [2][3][4][5],
have been carried out in real WiMAX, no work has focused on measurement
of the P2P performance in WiMAX. There have been a few studies on how to
design proper protocols for wireless/mobile P2P services without measurements.
Huang et al. [6] proposed a new hierarchical P2P scheme that seeks to cluster
nearby peers considering their network preﬁxes. They carry out simulations with
WiFi-connected peers, without considering mobility. Wu et al. [7] designed a
network architecture for a mobile P2P network consisting of ships in maritime
environments. They leverage ﬂooding to ﬁnd a ﬁle among ships, which is not
eﬃcient in mobile P2P scenarios; also, they rely only on simulations. Hsieh and
Sivakumar [8] discussed how cellular networks can support P2P communications;
however, there was no empirical study of mobile P2P performance.
Recently Kim et al. [9] carried out preliminary P2P measurements in a com-
mercial WiMAX network in Korea, dealing with traﬃc metrics, control overhead,
and peers’ performance. This paper is further extended based on the same log
explicitly targeting the handover impact, peers’ connectivity and stability, and
control signaling delay. To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to carry
out comprehensive empirical study of the BitTorrent performance in the mobile
WiMAX networks, with following contributions:
– We empirically measure BitTorrent performance of mobile users in commer-
cial WiMAX networks and the log data is shared in public1.
– We measure how handovers (HOs) degrade the performance of BitTorrent.
We observe that, on average, a HO reduces the throughput, number of
connected peers, and number of actively transmitting peers by 32.4%, 1.4%,
14.9% in the bus case, and by 14.7%, 3.5%, 0.5% in the subway case,
respectively.
– We investigate how BitTorrent behaves with user mobility in terms of con-
nectivity among peers, download/upload duration and throughput. Frequent
disconnections, short download session times, small download traﬃc, and
negligible upload contributions characterize the BitTorrent performance in
mobile environments.
– We analyze BitTorrent signaling overhead over the WiMAX network. Rela-
tively long RTTs and link instability make the BitTorrent signaling protocol
more ineﬃcient, with longer processing time.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes measure-
ment settings and test routes. We measure how handovers impact the BitTorrent
performance in Section 3. Sections 4 and 5 analyze the application level perfor-
mance of BitTorrent users and the BitTorrent signaling eﬃciency, respectively.
Concluding remarks are given in Section 6.

2 Experiment Description
2.1 Measurement Settings
We carried out the measurements in KT’s mobile WiMAX network in Seoul, Ko-
rea, which has more than 300,000 subscribers as of March 2010. In the WiMAX
network, one base station (BS) oﬀers the aggregated throughput of approxi-
mately 30 to 50 Mbps, and typically covers an area with a radius of 1 to 5
km. Depending on the distance between a BS and a subscriber station (SS), the
channel condition and its bit rate can vary substantially. (In this paper, we use
the terms “SS” and “WiMAX host” interchangeably.) When an SS crosses the
boundary between two BSs, it performs a HO, during which BitTorrent down-
load/upload will be aﬀected. Time-varying link conditions, inter-cell interference,
and HOs adversely aﬀect the BitTorrent performance.
We use three laptop computers, each with a WiMAX modem, for measure-
ments. The
three WiMAX modems are one KWM-U1000 and two
KWM-U1800s [10]. Another desktop computer is connected to the 100 Mbps
Ethernet in the campus network of Seoul National University for comparison
purposes. We modify the open-source BitTorrent software, Vuze [11], to record
logs every 0.5 second, e.g. peer list, download and upload rates. WinDump is
used to capture the packet headers; Wireshark and TCPTrace are used to an-
alyze the traces. We also use the XRO7000 toolkit [12] to observe the WiMAX
link layer activities such as the signal strength and HO messages.
2.2 Test Routes
Based on the similar measurement studies [2][4][5][9], we consider three scenarios
of WiMAX hosts: (1) Stationary: An SS is located stationarily inside a building
in the university campus, where a single WiMAX BS and a few repeaters cover
the entire campus area. The distance between the SS and the BS is about 800
meters without line-of-sight path; thus, the received signal strength is stable
but not strong. (2) Subway: We take the subway line #4 in Seoul Metro, from
Sadang station to Myeong-dong Station. The distance is about 12 km and it takes
about 20 minutes; there are 10 subway stations on the route. At every subway
station, a single BS is deployed, and one or more repeaters are installed between
adjacent BSs to enhance the radio signal. Therefore, HOs occur whenever a
subway train moves from one station to another. (3) Bus: We take the bus
#501 from Seoul National University to Seoul Railway Station. The distance of
the bus route is about 11 km and it took about 30 minutes when we carried out
the measurement.
We select a popular 400 MB video ﬁle, 25 minute long sitcom; at least 300
seeds are participating in the BitTorrent network. We carry out experiments
four times over four days in March, 2010; in each run, four hosts (Ethernet,
stationary, subway, and bus) start downloading the same ﬁle at the same time.

3 Impacts of Handovers
WiMAX adopts a break-and-make HO approach; thus, the throughput of the
WiMAX host is noticeably disrupted. We trace all HOs by observing the two
IEEE 802.16e MAC frames: MOB MSHO REQ indicating the beginning of a
HO, and HO RNG SUCCESS indicating the end of the HO. Then we average
relevant metrics at one second intervals. The changes of metrics over time (within
5 seconds before and after the HO) are shown in Fig. 1, where the vertical line
in the middle indicates the HO occurrences. We observe that in the bus case,
before the HOs, the carrier-to-interference ratio (CINR) always drops below 0;
hence, 0 dB may be the threshold to trigger a HO in the KT’s WiMAX network.
During a HO, packet transmissions are disrupted; thus, the retransmission time-
out may expire, which in turn reduces the TCP congestion window. Notice that
the download throughput in the bus case is nearly halved after the HO, and still
keeps on decreasing due to the slow recovery of TCP congestion control. What
is worse, the number of the actively transmitting peers is notably decreasing
before and after HOs in the bus case. On the other hand, in the subway case
the eﬀect of HOs is less severe; the RTT around a HO increases and hence the
download throughput decreases.
We calculate the average value of each metric before and after HOs, and show
the changes in Table 1. On average, a HO reduces the RTT, throughput, number
of connected peers, and number of active peers by 7.3%, 32.4%, 1.4%, 14.90% in

We observe that TCP transmissions are impacted by HOs the most signiﬁcantly.
4 BitTorrent Dynamics for Mobility in WiMAX
To evaluate the behaviors of BitTorrent protocols with other peers from a
WiMAX host’s view, we deﬁne the following terms, which are also illustrated in
Fig. 2:
– Connection Session (CS): It starts from the establishment of a connection
with a particular peer, and ends when the peer is disconnected. If the host is
disconnected from, but reconnects to the same peer again after 1 second, we
count them as two separate CSs. This term indicates the peers connectivity.
– Download/Upload Session (DS/US): It means a download/upload du-
ration during a single CS. We deﬁne that a DS/US ends if there is no
packet transmissions for longer than 1 second. These terms show the down-
load/upload stability.
– Download/Upload Traﬃc (DT/UT): It refers to the downloaded/
uploaded traﬃc load in bytes during a single DS/US. These terms indicate
the download/upload capability.

Fig. 2. An Illustration of A Peer’s Connections and Downloads/Uploads
A WiMAX host may connect to (and be disconnected from) the same peer
multiple times. Thus, we deﬁne a peer’s aggregated CS, aggregated DS/US
and aggregated DT/UT by summing CSs, DSs/USs and DTs/UTs with the
same peer. Note that all CSs and DSs/USs are originally in unit of seconds, but
normalized to the total download time of each case, respectively for compari-
son purposes. The total download times are 243.28s, 1208.05s , 1326.44s, and
1964.86s in the Ethernet, stationary, subway, and bus cases, respectively.
We observe that disconnections from other peers are caused by: (a) bad link
conditions due to fading and mobility (passive disconnection), and (b) BitTorrent
operations due to lack of incentives (active disconnection). We analyze CSs and
DSs/USs of the WiMAX hosts caused by passive disconnections in the following
sections to observe how WiMAX network impacts the BitTorrent performance.
4.1 Peer Connectivity
A TCP connection of a WiMAX host with a peer will be kept until it is actively
closed by the peer’s BitTorrent operation, or is passively disconnected due to bad
