 **Description**  
Currently airflow doesn't provide a way to submit a DAG (an experimental api
exists but not part of airflow deployment).  
Similarly it provides a way to delete dag but doesn't cleanup the file.
**Use case / motivation**  
We have a requirement where I want to generate a DAG programatically and then
submit to airflow.Similarly based upon user request would like to cleanup the
same.  
But as there are no standard way, this can depend on how you airflow cluster
is provisioned.If this can be standardised .
