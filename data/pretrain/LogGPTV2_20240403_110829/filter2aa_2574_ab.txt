Introduction
Open Source Intelligence Methods and Tools focuses on building a deep understanding 
of how to exploit open source intelligence (OSINT) techniques, methods, and tools 
to acquire information from publicly available online sources to support intelligence 
analysis. The harvested data can be used in different scenarios such as financial, crime, 
and terrorism investigations as well as in more regular tasks such as analyzing business 
competitors, running background checks, and acquiring intelligence about individuals 
and other entities. This book will also improve your skills in acquiring information 
online from the surface web, the deep web, and the darknet.
Many estimates show that 90 percent of useful information acquired by intelligence 
services comes from public sources (in other words, OSINT sources). Social media sites 
open up numerous opportunities for investigations because of the vast amount of useful 
information located in one place. For example, you can get a great deal of personal 
information about any person worldwide by just checking their Facebook page. This book 
will show you how to conduct advanced social media investigations to access content 
believed to be private, use advanced search engines queries to return accurate results, 
search historical deleted versions of websites, track individuals online using public record 
databases and people-searching tools, locate information buried in the deep web, access 
and navigate the dark web, collect intelligence from the dark web, view multiple historic 
satellite images and street views of any location, search geolocation information within 
popular social media sites, and more. In short, you will learn how to use a plethora of 
techniques, tools, and free online services to gather intelligence about any target online.
OSINT-gathering activities should be conducted secretly to avoid revealing the 
searcher’s identity. Therefore, this book will teach you how to conceal your digital 
identity and become anonymous online. You will learn how to exchange data secretly 
across hostile environments like the Internet and how to communicate with your peers 
privately and anonymously. You will also learn how to check your digital footprint and 
discover what kind of digital traces you are leaving behind and how to delete them.

 What the Book Is Not
This book is not about the history of open source intelligence, and it does not discuss at 
length the legal issues of personal reconnaissance online. We will not talk about policies 
and regulations that govern different countries or business organizations. Although 
some of these issues are discussed briefly in Chapter 1, the main aim of this book is to 
create a guidebook to support all types of investigations. You can read the chapters in 
any order because each chapter is considered an isolated unit that discusses the chapter 
subject’s comprehensively.

 Summary of Contents
Here is a brief description of each chapter’s contents:
• 
Chapter 1, “The Evolution of Open Source Intelligence”: In this 
chapter, we introduce you to the term OSINT and explain how it has 
evolved over time. We introduce the different parties interested in 
exploiting publicly available data and the benefits gained from doing 
so. We include some technical information about online gathering 
techniques and the challenges involved, as well as the legal aspects 
when harvesting data from publicly available sources.
• 
Chapter 2, “Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures”: 
In this chapter, we teach you everything you need to know to stay 
safe when going online. This knowledge is essential when conducting 
advanced searches online to avoid being tracked since using 
advanced search operators and other OSINT search techniques 
will attract attention online and make your connection a target for 
interception by different outside parties.
• 
Chapter 3, “The Underground Internet”: This chapter is devoted to 
uncovering the secrets of the invisible web, which contains both 
the darknet and the deep web. This knowledge is essential as the 
underground net contains a wealth of valuable information that any 
cybersecurity professional should know how to access.
• 
Chapter 4, “Search Engine Techniques”: In this chapter, we show you 
how to use advanced search techniques using typical search engines 
such as Google and Bing to find anything online. We also cover other 
specialized search engines for images, video, news, web directories, 
files, and FTP.
• 
Chapter 5, “Social Media Intelligence”: In this chapter, we show you 
how to use a wide array of tools and techniques to gather intelligence 
about a specific person or entity from social media sites. For instance, 
using Facebook you can gather intelligence about people worldwide. 
Other major tech companies like Google and Microsoft own huge 
databases of information about their users. A great amount of 
information is published publicly on these sites, and this chapter

teaches you how to search for people, including their relationships, 
names, addresses, and communications (and interactions) with others 
on social sites, to formulate a complete profile about your target.
• 
Chapter 6, “People Search Engines and Public Records”: Here we 
list specific search engines and other public resources to search 
for people’s names and get details around them. You will learn to 
use different reverse search criteria to find people online such as 
birth records, mail addresses, résumés, dating websites, e-mails, 
phone numbers, previous breached usernames, and more. We 
also cover government resources such as vital records, tax records, 
criminal information, and other public sources you can use to gain 
intelligence about people and entities.
• 
Chapter 7, “Online Maps”: This chapter covers how to use Google 
Maps and other free geolocation services to investigate the 
geolocation information acquired about target people.
• 
Chapter 8, “Technical Footprinting”: This chapter covers how to 
gather technical information about a target website and network 
system in passive mode to support your OSINT intelligence.
• 
Chapter 9, “What’s Next?”: This chapter covers the OSINT process 
and its future trends.
 Book Companion Website
In this book, we list hundreds of online services that help OSINT gatherers to collect and 
analyze information. We all know about the ever-changing nature of the Web, though; 
new sites launch and others close down daily, so some links might not work by the time 
you read this. To prevent this hassle and to avoid making part of this book useless after 
publishing it, we have created a dedicated website where we offer a digital list of all the 
links mentioned in this book in addition to many more resources that just wouldn’t fit in 
the printed version. We will do our best to keep this site updated and continually work to 
add new useful OSINT content that reflects improvements in the field. Dead links will get 
deleted or updated, so the content of this book will remain current for many years to come.

CHAPTER 1
The Evolution of Open 
Source Intelligence
Since the end of the Cold War, global societies have become more open, and the 
revolution of the Internet and its widespread use have turned the world into a small 
village. Unleashing the Internet network to billions of people worldwide to communicate 
and exchange digital data has shifted the entire world into what is now an information 
age. This transformation to the digital age brought huge benefits to our society; however, 
the speed and scope of the transformation have also triggered different kinds of risks. For 
instance, cybercriminals, terrorist groups, oppressive regimes, and all kinds of malicious 
actors are using the Internet effectively to conduct their crimes. Juniper Research 
predicts that cybercrime will cost businesses more than $2 trillion by 2019,i so these 
risks encourage governments to invest in the development of open source intelligence 
(OSINT) tools and techniques to counter current and future cybersecurity challenges.
OSINT refers to all the information that is publicly available. There is no specific 
date on when the term OSINT was first proposed; however, a relative term has probably 
been used for hundreds of years to describe the act of gathering intelligence through 
exploiting publicly available resources.
The United States is still leading the world in the intelligence arena, with vast 
resources dedicated by the U.S. government to its intelligence agencies that enable it to 
build sophisticated surveillance programs to harvest and analyze a large volume of data 
covering all the major spoken languages. This makes our discussion of OSINT history 
largely dependent on U.S. history, although during the Cold War many countries also 
developed OSINT capabilities to gain intelligence. Still, no other country has reached the 
level of the U.S. programs.

The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) defines OSINT as follows:
“Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is an intelligence that is 
produced from publicly available information and is collected, 
exploited, and disseminated in a timely manner to an appropriate 
audience for the purpose of addressing a specific intelligence 
requirement.”ii
In modern times, OSINT was introduced during World War II as an intelligence tool 
when the United States established the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS) to 
monitor publicly available information that related to supporting its troop operations at 
that time. This all happened before the U.S. intelligence community even existed.
After the end of World War II, the FBIS has continued its work in exploiting OSINT 
sources globally, until the September 11, 2001, terror attacks on the United States. This 
drew attention to the importance of creating an independent OSINT agency to intensify 
exploiting these resources to protect national security. This is what was suggested by the 
9/11 Commission, which called for the creation of a specialized agency for gathering 
OSINT.iii In 2005, the WMD Commission, which was formed to measure the effectiveness 
of the intelligence community to respond to threats raised by weapons of mass 
destruction (WMD) and other related threats of the 21st century, suggested the creation 
of an Open Source Directorate within the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).iv
Following these recommendations and other debates, the Director of National 
Intelligence (DNI) announced the creation of the National Intelligence Open Source 
Center (OSC). The main tasks of the OSC are to collect information available from 
both online and offline public sources, which was previously done by the FBIS. Later, 
the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, which was proposed to reform 
the intelligence activities of the U.S. government, merged the FBIS and other related 
research entities into one body. This organization is now called the Open Source 
Enterprise and is managed by the CIA.
OSINT sources are distinguished from other forms of intelligence because they must 
be legally accessible by the public without breaching any copyright or privacy laws. 
That’s why they are considered “publicly available.” This distinction makes the ability 
to gather OSINT sources applicable to more than just security services. For example, 
businesses can benefit from exploiting these resources to gain intelligence about their 
competitors.

Note! During the search for oSint sources, classified information that is not 
protected properly can appear. this includes leaked documents, such as those 
published by Wikileaks. this type of information is called noSint, as opposed to 
oSint. intelligence usually considers all sources regardless of their legal accessibility.
In addition to its significant importance to the intelligence community, OSINT 
gathering is less expensive and less risky than traditional spying activites. Unlike other 
intelligence sources that may require using spy satellite images or secret agents to 
collect information, all you need to gather OSINT online resources is a computer and an 
Internet connection. And, of course, you need the required searching skills.
As technology proliferates and the volume of available data increases, government 
departments, nongovernmental organization (NGO) organizations, and business 
corporations are starting to rely to a large extent on OSINT rather than private and 
classified information. This book will teach you how to exploit OSINT sources to search 
for and gather information online. In this chapter, we will describe the term OSINT, 
discuss the types of OSIN, and talk about different parties’ benefits from using OSINT 
and their motivations, as well as trends and challenges for the future. In later chapters, 
we will cover how to use a plethora of tools and techniques to acquire data from publicly 
available sources.
 Open Source Information Categories
There are different kinds of information that you may encounter when conducting 
OSINT analysis. According to the NATO Open Source Intelligence Handbook V1.2 
published in 2001, there are four categories of open information and intelligence.
• 
Open source data (OSD): This is generic data coming from a primary 
source. Examples include satellite images, telephone call data and 
metadata, datasets, survey data, photographs, and audio or video 
recordings that have recorded an event.
• 
Open source information (OSINF): This is generic data that has 
undergone some filtering first to meet a specific criterion or need; 
this data can also be called a secondary source. Examples include 
books about a specific subject, articles, dissertations, artworks, and 
interviews.
Chapter 1  the evolution of open SourCe intelligenCe

Note! the set of sources legally available to the public through specific channels 
is called gray literature. these sources include books, journals, dissertations, 
technical reports, and internal documents of commercial enterprises, commercial 
imagery, and any information that is controlled by its producer. gray literature is a 
major element of oSinf and can be obtained legally by acquiring the permission 
of its copyright holder or by paying for it (for example, through subscriptions 
agencies, commercial bookstores, and so on).
• 
Open source intelligence (OSINT): This includes all the information 
that has been discovered, filtered, and designated to meet a specific 
need or purpose. This information can be used directly in any 
intelligence context. OSINT can be defined in a nutshell as the output 
of open source material processing.
• 
Validated OSINT (OSINT-V): This is OSINT with a high degree of 
certainty; the data should be confirmed (verified) using a non-OSINT 
source or from a highly reputable OSINT source. This is essential, as 
some outside adversaries may spread inaccurate OSINT information 
with the intent to mislead OSINT analysis. A good example of this is 
when a TV station broadcasts live the arrival of a president to another 
country; such information is OSINT, but it has a large degree of certainty.
As you saw, OSD and OSINF comprise the main sources (primary and secondary) of 
information that OSINT uses to drive its results.
Another issue you need to understand within the OSINT context is the difference 
between data, information, and knowledge. The three terms are usually used 
interchangeably; however, each one has a different meaning, although the three do 
interact with each other.
• 
Data: This is a set of facts describing something without further 
explanation or analysis. For example, “The price of gold per ounce is 
$1,212.”
• 
Information: This is a kind of data that has been interpreted properly to 
give a useful meaning within a specific context. For example, “The price 
of gold per ounce has fallen from $1,212 to $1,196 within one week.”
Chapter 1  the evolution of open SourCe intelligenCe

• 
Knowledge: This is a combination of information, experience, and 
insight that has been learned or inferred after some experimentation. 
Knowledge describes what your brain has recorded in the past, and 
these records can help you to make better decisions about the future 
when facing similar contexts. For example, “When the price of gold 
falls more than 5 percent, this means the price of oil will fall too.”
 OSINT Types
OSINT includes all publicly accessible sources of information. This information can be 
found either online or offline, including in the following places:
• 
The Internet, which includes the following and more: forums, blogs, 
social networking sites, video-sharing sites like YouTube.com, wikis, 
Whois records of registered domain names, metadata and digital 
files, dark web resources, geolocation data, IP addresses, people 
search engines, and anything that can be found online
• 
Traditional mass media (e.g., television, radio, newspapers, books, 
magazines)
• 
Specialized journals, academic publications, dissertations, 
conference proceedings, company profiles, annual reports, company 
news, employee profiles, and résumés
• 
Photos and videos including metadata
• 
Geospatial information (e.g., maps and commercial imagery 
products)
 Digital Data Volume
As you already saw, OSINT encompasses not only online sources. Paper editions of 
public sources must also get investigated thoroughly as part of any OSINT-gathering 
process; however, online sources comprise the largest segment of OSINT.
Chapter 1  the evolution of open SourCe intelligenCe

Today we live in an information age, and publishers as well as corporations, 
universities, and other suppliers of OSINT sources are shifting their business processes 
to digital formats. The number of users on social media sites will also continue to 
increase, and the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices will intensify in the future, 
leading to a huge increase in the volume of digital data coming from the billions of 
sensors and machines worldwide. In other words, most OSINT sources in the future will 
be online sources.
Note! gartner estimates that 20.4 billion iot devices will be in use by 2020.v
The volume of digital data is exploding rapidly. According to IDC Research,vi by the 
year 2020, the total amount of digital data created worldwide will reach 44 zettabytes, 
and the number will increase faster within five years to reach 180 zettabytes in 2025.
By 2020, the Gartner research group estimates that an average person will spend 
time interacting with automated bots more than with their spouse, and of course all 
these interactions will be digital. Another estimate says that in 2021, 20 percent of 
all activities a human do will involve using a service from at least one of the giant IT 
companies (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon). Not to mention, most people will prefer 
to use voice commands to interact with their computing devices over typing.
These figures should give you an idea about what the near future will look like in the 
digital age. The volume of digital data along with the increased number of people using 
the Internet to do their jobs will make online sources the primary source of OSINT for 
both governments and business corporations in the future.
 OSINT Organizations
Some specialized organizations provide OSINT services. Some of them are government
