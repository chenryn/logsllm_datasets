4.2 VoIP Traﬃc Analysis
For VoIP experiments, we have generated voice traﬃc that has the same charac-
teristics of the G.711 voice codec without Packet Loss Concealment (PLC) [8].
The payload size is set to 160 bytes and the sending interval to 20 ms in G.711
codec without PLC. The resulting throughput of VoIP traﬃc is 64 Kbps. We col-
lected 10 300-second-long data sets after transmitting voice packets between the
MN and the CN. Because the clocks on the MN and CN were not synchronized,
we could not measure the one-way delay accurately. Instead, we took round-trip
measurements of VoIP traﬃc, and halved the delay. Due to the diﬀerence in
uplink and downlink bandwidths, half the round-trip delay is likely to be larger
than the one-way uplink delay. However, the WiBro link was very lightly loaded

as we have seen in the previous section and thus we assume the diﬀerence in
transmission delay to be minimal. In the rest of this section, all the delays we
use are calculated as described.
Figure 4 plots the delay, loss, and R-factor of mobile VoIP traﬃc measure-
ments. We plot loss rates and R-factors calculated over 5 seconds as before.
During the mobile experiment, handoﬀs occurred 17 times and most of delay
spikes and burst losses occur near handoﬀs. We mark the points of the inter-
RAS handoﬀs in solid lines and inter-sector handoﬀs in dashed lines in Figure 4.
Almost all packets experiences delay below 200 ms, but during handoﬀs some
packets experiences delay over 400 ms. We note a delay spike of 5 sec about half
way through the measurement experiment between 1600 and 1700 seconds on
the x-axis. Delay spikes and burst losses have been reported in both wired and
wireless networks, and there are many possible causes, such as cell or sector re-
selection, link-level error recovery, wireless bandwidth ﬂuctuation and blocking
by higher priority traﬃc [15,5]. However, this delay spike does not coincide with
a handoﬀ, and needs further investigation.
Figure 5 shows the R-factor of VoIP quality of uplink (MN to CN) and down-
link (CN to MN) in the stationary and mobile cases. The R-factor is calculated

every 5 seconds. From the ﬁgure we have found that more than 99% of R-factors
are above 90 in both the stationary and the mobile case and only 0.2% of R-
factors is below 70 in the mobile case. The R-factor of 70 or above is considered
toll-quality, and thus mobile devices attached to the WiBro network are likely
to experience toll-quality using VoIP applications.
To quantify the impact of handoﬀs on QoS of VoIP, we have computed R-
factors using average delay and loss rate for the interval of 5 seconds before and
after the handoﬀ and compared with the overall cumulative distribution function
(CDF) of R-factors in Figure 6. Here again we observe that the about 99% of
R-factors during handoﬀs are more than 85, which translates to good quality for
voice communication.
5 Summary and Future Work
In this work, we have conducted experiments to evaluate QoS of VoIP appli-
cations over the WiBro network. In order to capture the baseline performance
of the WiBro network we measure and analyze the characteristics of delay and
throughput under stationary and mobile scenarios. Then we evaluate QoS of
VoIP applications using the E–Model of ITU–T G.107. Our measurements show
that the achievable maximum throughputs are 5.3 Mbps in downlink and 2 Mbps
in uplink. VoIP quality is better than or at least as good as toll quality despite
user mobility exceeding the projected limit of WiBro mobility support. Using
RAS and sector identiﬁcation information, we show that the handoﬀ is correlated
with throughput and quality degradation.
The WiBro network is in its early phase of deployment and about 70,000
subscribers are reported to have signed up. As our CBR traﬃc analysis shows,
the network is very lightly loaded, allowing near maximum throughputs for many
5-second-long periods. In future, we plan to conduct more experiments with
cross-traﬃc injection and TCP traﬃc.
