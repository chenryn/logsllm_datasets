Question: "When designing a network monitoring system to detect possible data exfiltration over unconventional mediums like Bluetooth, which of the following measures should be implemented to enhance detection capabilities? (Select two)"
 "A": "Monitor for file access patterns that could indicate exfiltration, such as file reads by a process with an active network connection."
 "B": "Deploy network intrusion detection systems on all endpoints regardless of their network usage patterns."
 "C": "Analyze network traffic for anomalies in expected protocol standards and traffic flows."
 "D": "Limit the monitoring to the primary wired Internet connections to focus on the most likely exfiltration channels."
Answer: AC
