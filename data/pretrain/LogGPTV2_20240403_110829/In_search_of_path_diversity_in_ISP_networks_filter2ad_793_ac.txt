### Path Diversity Accuracy in Rocketfuel Topologies

To assess the accuracy of path diversity in the Rocketfuel topologies, we compute four new ratios for link- and PoP-disjoint paths in the corresponding Sprintinf-bb and Sprintinf-rev topologies:

- For Sprintinf-bb:
  - \( RLI_{bb} = \frac{LI_{bb}(i, j)}{LR(i, j)} \)
  - \( RPI_{bb} = \frac{PI_{bb}(i, j)}{PA(i, j)} \)

- For Sprintinf-rev:
  - \( RLI_{rev} = \frac{LI_{rev}(i, j)}{LR(i, j)} \)
  - \( RPI_{rev} = \frac{PI_{rev}(i, j)}{PR(i, j)} \)

Figures 3 and 4 present the cumulative distributions of these ratios. From these figures, we observe that both heuristics reduce the difference in path diversity. However, even after applying them, they overestimate the path diversity for the vast majority of PoP pairs. Interestingly, after correcting some false links, path diversity is underestimated for some PoP pairs. This underestimation reflects links that Rocketfuel was unable to capture through measurements. The path diversity in Sprintinf-rev is the closest to that found in Sprintreal, but it only matches the number of link-disjoint paths of Sprintreal for approximately 20% of the PoP pairs and 28% of the pairs when considering PoP-disjoint paths.

### Active Measurements and Path Diversity

The differences in path diversity presented in the previous section are specific to the Sprint topology inferred by Rocketfuel. Although Rocketfuel represents an improvement in measuring ISP topologies, active measurement techniques still have limitations that prevent them from accurately capturing path diversity. These limitations pose a significant obstacle for using such topologies as a basis for studying traffic engineering or the robustness of ISP networks.

The process of discovering an ISP network's topology can be divided into two steps: probing the network to discover links and processing those links to infer the topology. Backup links, which are not traversed by probes, are not included in the generated topologies unless there is a failure during the measurement period that causes probes to use backup links. Consequently, inferred topologies primarily capture active path diversity and, in some cases, part of the complete path diversity. For the Sprint network, the complete path diversity is only 5% more than the active path diversity on average. Therefore, in this section, we use the Sprint network topology without backup links as a basis for comparison.

#### Sources of Inaccuracy in Generating ISP Topologies from Active Measurements

Below, we discuss the sources of inaccuracy introduced in each step of generating ISP topologies from active measurements and potential solutions. We analyze the percentage of links missed and added during the probing and processing of the Sprint network. Table 1 summarizes the percentage of inter-PoP links missed and added at each step, computed over the total number of links in Sprintreal. The last column presents the overall percentage of missed and added links by combining both steps. These differences were computed by comparing inter-PoP links from Sprintreal to Sprintinf.

| Links         | Missed (%) | Added (%) |
|---------------|------------|-----------|
| Reverse links | 58.57      | 37.14     |
| PoPs not connected | 5.71    | 31.43     |
| Connected PoPs | -          | 80        |
| Probing       | 58.57      | 37.14     |
| Processing    | -          | 717.14    |
| Overall       | 8.57       | 608.57    |

**Table 1: Percentage of missed and added links in each step of generating the Rocketfuel PoP topology relative to the number of links in the Sprintreal topology.**

#### Inaccuracies Introduced During Probing

We compare Sprintreal without backup links with the topology induced by the raw Rocketfuel traces to quantify inaccuracies introduced during probing. We select links from the traces that connect different PoPs and are also present in Sprintinf. The topology induced by the set of links discovered by probes is called Sprinttraces. Table 1 shows that the Rocketfuel probes missed almost 60% of the inter-PoP links in the Sprint network. Active measurements miss links for two main reasons:

- **Lack of vantage points:** End-to-end measurements only capture links traversed by probes. A vantage point is a host that is the source of probes. Increasing the number of vantage points and varying their locations increases the probability of finding links. If there are two paths with the same cost between two points in the ISP network and probes are always hashed to the same path, then all links in the alternate path are missed. Probes from another vantage point may find alternative equal-cost paths. Missing links may cause the resulting topology to understate the active path diversity.
- **Incomplete traceroutes:** Probes may be incomplete, i.e., there may be some unknown hops (‘*’) in the traceroutes. In this case, Rocketfuel conservatively ignores incomplete parts of the traces. Examining the traces for the Sprint network, we observed that there were not many instances of non-responses to probes in the segment of the trace that traverses the core of the Sprint network. Consequently, we do not believe that this is a major source of missing links in Sprinttraces.

Surprisingly, Sprinttraces contain a number equivalent to 37.14% of the total number of links in Sprintreal that do not exist in the real network, even when considering backup links. Almost all of these extra links are between a pair of PoPs that are connected in the real network. This may arise due to network topology changes during the probing. A smaller fraction of links, equivalent to 5.71% of all links in Sprintreal, connects PoPs that have no connection in the real network. These extra links could be caused by incorrect DNS resolution.

The two main causes of finding extra links during probing are:

- **Changes in the path of a probe:** The process of probing takes time during which its path may change. The path a probe takes may change due to a change in the network topology itself or a routing policy change that impacts the best forwarding path. ISPs are constantly maintaining and upgrading their networks by adding and removing links. Failures cause some links to be removed from the topologies and may cause some backup links to become active. Changes in the network topology may lead to false connectivity. If the forwarding path to the destination of the probe changes during the traceroute, it may appear that there is a link between two routers that are not connected in the real network. Eliminating links that do not have corresponding reverse links, as done for the Sprintinf-rev topology, should greatly reduce such false connectivity.
- **Incorrect DNS:** DNS names are used to determine which links belong to a particular ISP network and to map IP addresses to PoPs. Some addresses may be incorrectly mapped due to misconfiguration or changes in the ISP topology that have not been reported to DNS, leading to the inclusion of false links in the traces.

#### Inaccuracies from Processing Probed Links

After capturing as many links as possible using active measurements, tools like Rocketfuel process the resulting traces to produce a more accurate map of the ISP network. To assess the effects of processing the traces on the final topology, we compare the percentage of inter-PoP links connecting every pair of PoPs in Sprinttraces with the percentage in Sprintinf. Table 1 shows that processing the traces adds more than seven times as many links as the real network for two main reasons:

- **Alias resolution:** After collecting links, measurement tools perform a series of tests to resolve aliases. If two interfaces that belong to the same router are not accurately resolved to the same node, the resulting topology will have a larger number of router-disjoint paths than in the real network. Conversely, if two interfaces in different routers are mistakenly mapped to the same router, the resulting topology will have more link-disjoint paths. Rocketfuel introduced several new techniques to resolve aliases, including using information in DNS names. An interface’s DNS name sometimes encodes the router that has the interface, and at other times encodes the router at the other end of the link. This difference in convention can lead to incorrect grouping of interfaces. Grouping two interfaces in different routers will result in a router with more connectivity, thereby overstating the number of link-disjoint paths. In Table 1, extra links between PoPs that are connected in Sprintreal represent interfaces that were not correctly mapped to the same router in a PoP, whereas links in Sprintinf between PoPs that have no connection in the real network represent either interfaces in different routers that were mistakenly collapsed or a router that has an incorrect DNS name.
- **Adding reverse links:** Once a probe finds a link between two routers, it is tempting to add a reverse edge between them. Indiscriminately adding reverse links, however, may inflate the number of links in the inferred topology compared to the number of links in the real network. Traceroute reports the incoming interfaces of routers. Hence, if two different vantage points probe the same link from different directions, it will appear as two different links. If the alias resolution mechanism was perfect, it would map all the interfaces to the same router, and considering all links to be bidirectional would be a safe assumption. After the alias resolution step, Rocketfuel completes the topology by adding reverse links. This step introduces a number of false links to Sprintinf that is equivalent to 80% of the links in the real network. This result suggests that, until we have more accurate techniques for alias resolution, links should be considered directed in the traces.

Given how sensitive path diversity is to false or missing links, accurately representing path diversity in ISP networks using active measurements remains an open problem. We are working on improving the accuracy of path diversity in the Rocketfuel topologies and determining the limits to which active measurement techniques can capture such topological properties.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we describe our efforts to characterize path diversity in ISP network topologies. Using the real Sprint IP topology, we find that Sprint has significant path diversity. We then characterize path diversity in a larger set of ISP networks using the recent Rocketfuel ISP topologies inferred from active measurements. However, comparing the real Sprint topology to the one inferred by Rocketfuel, we find that the Rocketfuel topology has significantly higher apparent path diversity. We evaluate two heuristics that improve the accuracy of capturing path diversity in the topologies, but substantial differences remain.

Although the Rocketfuel topologies have benefited from some evaluation and validation, this is the first time they have been systematically compared to a real topology and evaluated from the perspective of path diversity. Due to constraints faced by active measurements, these topologies both contain false links and miss actual links. We show that the post-processing of the traces, particularly the alias resolution step, introduces a large number of false links in the topology. As a metric, path diversity is particularly sensitive to such errors since each error changes the path diversity by one for at least one pair of PoPs. We are working on improving the accuracy of path diversity in the Rocketfuel topologies and determining the limits to which active measurement techniques can capture such topological properties.
