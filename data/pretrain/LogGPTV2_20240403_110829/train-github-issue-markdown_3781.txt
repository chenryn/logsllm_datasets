## Context
We export a Next.js site using `next export` and deploy it to Netlify. We
noticed that after deploying a new version of the site, all users who have the
previous version open in the browser cannot follow links anymore.
## Expected Behavior
The router's `onAppUpdated` event is triggered and causes a reload of the page
by default, as documented in the README.
## Current Behavior
`onRouteChangeStart` is triggered, but `onAppUpdated` (or even
`onRouteChangeError`) is never called. Instead, nothing user-visible happens.
The browser developer tools reveal a failed `` request (because the
build ID - and thus the JS chunk's path - changed) which is apparently not
being acted upon.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Create a Next.js page with at least one (non-prefetch) link and create a listener for `onAppUpdated`.
  2. Build it with `next export`, serve it (e.g. `npx server _build`) and visit it.
  3. With the page open, rebuild the page (another `next export`).
  4. Try clicking on the link you created. Nothing happens, and the `onAppUpdated` listener is not called.
