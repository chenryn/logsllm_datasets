User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Linux apache mod_auth_sspi installation I am running an Apache/2.4.7 Linux webserver and working on an intranet project where users of Internet Explorer need to be authenticated automatically. Their windows username has to be displayed in a greeting on the intranet homepage.

I downloaded the mod_auth_sspi module from SourceForge and unzipped the file.

I located a mod_auth_sspi.so file in mod_auth_sspi-1.0.4\bin. 

I move that .so file into /etc/apache2/mod-available and added the following line to the bottom of my /etc/apache2/apache2.conf file:

LoadModule mod_auth_sspi mods-available/mod_auth_sspi.so


With all that done I attempted to reload my server and got the following error:

sudo apache2ctl restart 
apache2: Syntax error on line 225 of /etc/apache2/apache2.conf: Cannot load mods-available/mod_auth_sspi.so into server: /etc/apache2/mods-available/mod_auth_sspi.so: invalid ELF header
Action 'restart' failed.
The Apache error log may have more information.


I am very new into installing and configuring Apache module. 

Can anyone advice if my steps listed above are correct and what I can do to correctly get mod_auth_sspi working?

Any help would be appreciated.

Assistant: You are trying to install a Win32 Binary into Linux... it won't work (I'm acutally facing the same Problem). As far as I see, there is no source for Linux (as development has stopped) anymore... if you find something, let me know!
