User: How do I get python to work with aptana studio?
I've downloaded a bunch of stuff, but none of them seem to give me a straight text editor where I can interpret code into an executable type thing. I know there's interactive mode in IDLE, but I want to actually use an editor. So I downloaded the pydev extensions for Aptana studio, but it wants me to configure a python interpreter (so I guess it actually doesn't have one). Where can I find a straight python interpreter that will work with this? or another IDE?
Assistant: On Mac OS X Leopard and Tiger, Python is already installed.
On Mac, I've tried a few editor. Textmate is my current choice. If you're looking for a free one, I really liked Xcode. But you'll have to run your script from the command line.
If you want a cross-platform environment, you could try Eclipse and the pydev extension. So you don't get lost between the two platform.
