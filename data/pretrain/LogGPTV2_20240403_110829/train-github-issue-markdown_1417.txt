When overriding the contrastDefaultColor of a theme, the text color of a
button does not change.
    import { createMuiTheme } from 'material-ui/styles'
    import cyan from 'material-ui/colors/cyan'
    const theme = createMuiTheme({
      palette: {
        primary: {
          ...cyan,
          contrastDefaultColor: 'light'
        },
      },
    })

    Example
