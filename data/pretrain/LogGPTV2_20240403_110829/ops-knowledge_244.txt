User: I messed up my IDLE shortcut. What is the way to start IDLE from the cmd.exe shell in Windows?
Assistant: On my system, running C:\Python26\lib\idlelib\idle.py launches idle from the command prompt.  Obviously you will need to adjust your path if your main Python directory isn't C:\Python26\.
It looks like you could also launch it via idle.pyw or idle.bat in that same directory.
