### Describe the bug
If we take a look into master of sqlalchemy it defines following
install_requires:
    greenlet != 0.4.17;(platform_machine=='aarch64' or (platform_machine=='ppc64le' or (platform_machine=='x86_64' or (platform_machine=='amd64' or (platform_machine=='AMD64' or (platform_machine=='win32' or platform_machine=='WIN32'))))))
Thus because platform_machine is not one of the above, greenlet is never
installed. I was told that platform_machine for such macos is `arm64` (I do
not have Mac M1 at hand)
This in effect prevents sqlalchemy from running.
Fix is easy by `pip install greenlet` and then everything is back to normal.
### To Reproduce
    $ pip install sqlalchemy[asyncio]
    $ pip show
        SQLAlchemy==1.4.35
    While it should be:
    $ pip show
        greenlet==1.1.2
        SQLAlchemy==1.4.35
