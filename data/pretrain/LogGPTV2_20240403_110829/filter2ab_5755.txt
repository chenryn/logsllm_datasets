**ATT&CK ID:** T1525  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Implant Internal Image

Adversaries may implant cloud or container images with malicious code to establish persistence after gaining access to an environment. This technique can be applied to various cloud and container platforms, including Amazon Web Services (AWS) Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Images, Azure Images, and popular container runtimes such as Docker.

Unlike the "Upload Malware" technique, which involves directly uploading malicious files, this method focuses on embedding malicious code within an image stored in a registry within the victim's environment. If the infrastructure provisioning tool is configured to always use the latest image, this could provide adversaries with persistent access to the environment.
