## Abstract
Peering infrastructures, including colocation facilities and Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), are critical components of the global Internet, supporting hundreds of thousands of interconnections. Despite their robust design, these infrastructures can experience outages due to power failures, human errors, attacks, and natural disasters. However, there is limited understanding of the frequency and impact of such outages. In this paper, we present a novel, lightweight methodology for detecting and localizing peering infrastructure outages. Our approach leverages BGP communities, which provide valuable, yet underutilized, information about the location of outages. We develop and deploy a system, Kepler, that can pinpoint the epicenter of an outage at the building level and track network reactions in near real-time. Our analysis reveals four times as many outages as those publicly reported over the past five years, and highlights the significant impact on remote networks and other peering infrastructures. This study offers a unique perspective on the Internet's behavior under stress, often unreported.

## 1. Introduction
The smooth and uninterrupted operation of the Internet is crucial for both the economy and social life. While the Internet has shown remarkable resilience, even short outages can significantly impact users. Past studies have focused on major outages caused by hardware, software, configuration failures, optical layer issues, natural disasters, and nation-wide censorship. These events typically affected individual networks or entire regions, reflecting the hierarchical nature of the Internet's architecture.

In recent years, the Internet's infrastructure has flattened, with most inter-domain traffic flowing directly between edge networks, bypassing transit providers. Direct peering, enabled by third-party peering infrastructures like colocation facilities and IXPs, reduces costs and improves performance. These infrastructures, considered critical by many governments, are increasingly deployed globally, supporting a growing number of peerings.

Despite their importance, little is known about outages at these peering infrastructures. Such outages, caused by interruptions, misconfigurations, or failures, can affect multiple networks. To our knowledge, the only detailed study of such an outage is the World Trade Center incident after the September 11 attack, which had a major impact on some service providers but not the Internet as a whole. Given the increasing international membership of these infrastructures, local outages may now have more global effects.

## Our Approach
We introduce a novel methodology to detect and investigate peering infrastructure outages. Our detection mechanism relies on the observation that BGP communities, introduced in 1996, provide meta-information about prefixes announced to customer and peer networks. These communities are widely used for traffic engineering, blackholing, and troubleshooting. By leveraging location-based BGP community values, we can accurately pinpoint the location, start time, and duration of outages. We augment our analysis with a physical map of facilities and targeted traceroute measurements to confirm our inferences.

### Contributions
- A novel, lightweight methodology for detecting, localizing, and tracking outages at peering infrastructures using BGP data and colocation data.
- Implementation of our methodology in Kepler, an operational monitoring system, which detected four times as many outages as those previously reported.
- Augmentation of our analysis with traceroute and traffic data to investigate the impact of outages, revealing that local outages can have significant global effects.

## 2. Background
Networks often interconnect through multiple physical links established over peering facilities, sometimes in different locations within the same city. Historically, these facilities were maintained by transit providers, but the advent of IXPs and the flattening of the Internet hierarchy led to the popularity of carrier-neutral facilities, such as colocation centers, which allow diverse connectivity options.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows:
- Section 2 discusses the changing interconnection landscape.
- Section 3 introduces our methodology and the datasets we compiled.
- Section 4 explains the development of Kepler and its implementation.
- Section 5 evaluates our methodology.
- Sections 7 and 8 discuss the implications of our work and summarize our contributions, respectively.
