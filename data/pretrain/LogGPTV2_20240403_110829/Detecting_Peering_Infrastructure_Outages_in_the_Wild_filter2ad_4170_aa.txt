ABSTRACT
Peering infrastructures, namely, colocation facilities and Internet
exchange points, are located in every major city, have hundreds
of network members, and support hundreds of thousands of in-
terconnections around the globe. These infrastructures are well
provisioned and managed, but outages have to be expected, e.g.,
due to power failures, human errors, attacks, and natural disasters.
However, little is known about the frequency and impact of outages
at these critical infrastructures with high peering concentration.
In this paper, we develop a novel and lightweight methodology
for detecting peering infrastructure outages. Our methodology re-
lies on the observation that BGP communities, announced with
routing updates, are an excellent and yet unexplored source of
information allowing us to pinpoint outage locations with high
accuracy. We build and operate a system that can locate the epi-
center of infrastructure outages at the level of a building and track
the reaction of networks in near real-time. Our analysis unveils
four times as many outages as compared to those publicly reported
over the past five years. Moreover, we show that such outages have
significant impact on remote networks and peering infrastructures.
Our study provides a unique view of the Internet’s behavior under
stress that often goes unreported.

1 INTRODUCTION
Today, our economy as well as our social life, rely on the smooth
and uninterrupted operation of the Internet. While the Internet has
shown an amazing resilience as a whole, even short outages can
have a significant impact on a subset of the Internet user population.
Past major Internet outages have been studied in depth, including
outages due to network component failure, e.g., hardware, software,
and configuration failures in routers [98], optical layer outages [47],
natural disasters [20, 23, 35, 56, 84], and nation-wide censorship [23,
24, 83]. Most of these events affected either individual networks or
entire regions. This can be attributed to the fact that the Internet’s
architecture used to be quite hierarchical. Thus, most local outages
were expected to have a local impact.
During recent years the Internet infrastructure has changed sig-
nificantly, a phenomenon that is referred to as the “flattening” of
the Internet’s hierarchy. In this setting, the majority of Internet
inter-domain traffic flows directly between edge networks, bypass-
ing transit providers [62]. For example, eyeball networks reduce
their transit costs and improve end-to-end performance [41, 49]
by directly peering with content providers, content distribution
networks, and cloud providers, which are now a major source of traf-
fic [32, 46, 82]. Direct peering is enabled by third party peering infras-
tructures (also referred as carrier-neutral peering infrastructures),
such as colocation facilities and Internet Exchange Points (IXPs).
These infrastructures are increasingly deployed in cities around
the globe [50], and their members are growing constantly [61, 68]
supporting hundreds of thousands of peerings [100].
Given the high concentration of peerings established at coloca-
tion facilities and via IXPs, many government bodies consider them
critical infrastructures [30, 39, 64, 96]. Unfortunately, little is known
about outages at these peering infrastructures, i.e., outages due to
interruption, misconfiguration, and failure in the supply of power,
the hardware, or the software that supports the operation of the
peering facility. Such outages are affecting multiple networks, thus
have different characteristics than those due to faulty operation or
failure of an individual router or a single network provider. To the
best of our knowledge, the only detailed study of such an outage is
about the World Trade Center after the September 11 attack [13].
The report concludes that the catastrophic failure had “little effect
on the Internet as a whole” but “a major effect on the services of-
fered by some information and service providers”. However, these
infrastructures have gained an increasingly international set of net-
work members in the last 15 years [16, 18]. Thus, it is quite possible
that a local outage at one of these infrastructures today has a more
global effect.

infrastructure including some of the carrier facilities of major U.S.
ISPs was released last year [34], we lack a detailed map of peering
infrastructures. Two recent works attempt to tackle this problem by
using large-scale active traceroute campaigns to infer the IP-level
connectivity at colocation facilities [50, 72]. However, these meth-
ods scale only for a limited number of ASes or a limited number of
facilities. This is due to the scale of the required active queries and
the resource limitations of the available measurement platforms,
such as RIPE Atlas and Looking Glasses [48, 91].
Our Approach: We introduce a novel methodology to reliably
detect peering infrastructure outages in the wild and investigate
their impact. Our detection mechanism relies on the observation
that BGP is no longer purely an “information hiding protocol” [92].
The BGP Communities attribute, introduced with RFC1997 [17] in
1996, provides meta-information regarding prefixes announced
to customer and peer networks, and is used for traffic engineer-
ing [85], traffic blackholing to mitigate attacks [31], and network
troubleshooting [44]. Their use has become quite popular in recent
years (Section 3.2) allowing us to use them as a crowd-sourcing
mechanism for acquiring accurate location information for about
50% of all BGP IPv4 updates (Section 5.2).
While BGP routing updates have been used to detect outages
limited to the AS and prefix granularities [8, 20, 24, 60], our novel in-
sight is that Communities with location information in BGP updates
can reveal the occurrence and location of peering infrastructure
outages. Our methodology relies on location-based BGP Commu-
nity values and allows us to pinpoint the exact location as well
as the starting time and duration of the outage at high accuracy.
To assess the impact of an outage, we track the changes in the
use of the Communities by the members of the affected facility.
However, since the semantics of the Communitiy attributes vary in
geolocation granularity, from facility or IXP to city or metropoli-
tan area, and Communities are not attached in every BGP update,
monitoring Communities alone is not sufficient. To address these
limitations, we augment our analysis with a physical map of facili-
ties which allows us to correlate location-specific routing changes
with the colocation of ASes in common peering infrastructures (Sec-
tion 3.3). Moreover, we use archived and a small number of targeted
traceroute measurements to confirm our inferences (Section 6.3).
• A novel lightweight methodology for detecting, localizing, and
tracking outages at peering infrastructures through passive mon-
itoring of BGP data, by combining location-tagging BGP Com-
munities with colocation data in facilities and IXPs.
• We instantiate our methodology in an operational monitoring
system, Kepler, and we use it to study infrastructure outages visi-
ble in public BGP data between 2012 – 2016. We unveil four times
as many outages at major peering infrastructures as compared
to those previously reported in major networking mailing lists
and news websites.
• We augment our analysis with targeted and archived traceroute
measurements, and traffic data to further investigate the impact of
the detected outages. We find that a large number of the affected
links with remote networks can be hundreds or even thousands
of miles away from the location of the incident, challenging the
mental model that local outages have only local impact. Our study
In summary, our contributions are the following:
Figure 1: Detected and reported infrastructure outages per

Hurricane Sandy.
Unfortunately, a system that can detect and report on peering in-
frastructure outages in an automated fashion is not available. Such a
system would be of increasing interest for many Internet stakehold-
ers. Network operators can be informed, in real-time, about ongoing
outages, which today mainly happens via out-of-band communica-
tion after the event, if at all. Timely detection of outages based on
routing data can help operators optimize their mitigation strategies
and the communication with their customers. Policy makers can
make use of such a system to improve their situational awareness
regarding the threats to critical infrastructures. Finally, researchers
can understand how the evolving Internet behaves under stress. To
enable the above capabilities, we build Kepler, a system that detects
peering infrastructure outages with the aim to understand the ex-
ternalities of such outages, improve current monitoring practices,
and potentially help in improving the resilience of the Internet at
the regional and global level.
By extracting location meta-data encoded in BGP messages, Ke-
pler can detect 159 facilities and IXP outages over the last 5 years,
four times more than publicly reported in popular operators and
outage mailing lists [25, 26, 67, 74]. Figure 1 shows the number
of facility and IXP outages we detect per 6-months since 2012,
compared to the number of facility and IXP outages reported. Sur-
prisingly, even infrastructure outages with large effects are not
necessarily communicated via these mailing lists.1 One alternative
communication channel of outage events is through social media,
where operators often resort to seeking answers on network dis-
ruptions. However, extracting this information remains a manual
and error-prone search process [9].
To develop Kepler we have to tackle the following challenges:
Identify Outages: How to detect outages at peering infrastruc-
tures given that previous work has illustrated that even identify-
ing the AS responsible for major routing events is a challenging
task [42, 94, 99].
Characterize Outages: The next challenge is to assess the start,
duration, impact, and frequency of an outage. Often, public infor-
mation, such as press releases after an outage, are of questionable
accuracy and detail, and there is limited transparency on what
actually happened and which parts of the Internet were affected.
Locate Outages: The third challenge is to detect the exact loca-
tion of an outage. While a map of the U.S. long-haul fiber-optic

reveals that interconnection strategies such as remote peering
and the colocation of ASes at multiple diverse locations create
unexpected interdependencies among peering infrastructures
that remain largely unnoticeable during normal operation, but
disrupt connectivity in counter-intuitive ways during outages.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses
the changing interconnection landscape. Section 3 introduces our
methodology and the datasets we compile to make it feasible. Sec-
tion 4 explains how we develop Kepler to implement the proposed
methodology, which we evaluate in Section 5. Finally, Sections 7
and 8 discuss the implications of our work and summarize our
contributions respectively.
2 BACKGROUND
Networks often interconnect through multiple physical links estab-
lished over peering facilities, sometimes even in different locations
in the same city [73, 92]. While in the past the majority of facilities
were maintained by individual transit providers to interconnect
with their customers, the advent of IXPs and the flattening of the In-
ternet hierarchy led to the increasing popularity of carrier-neutral
facilities, such as colocation facilities, which allow connectivity
