### Environment Details
- **Dubbo Version:** 2.7.7
- **Operating System:** macOS
- **Java Version:** 1.8
- **Spring Boot Version:** 2.3.1.RELEASE

### Problem Description
I am facing an issue with dynamically discovering Dubbo service providers. Specifically, I have multiple implementations of a service, each separated by different groups. However, I do not know the number of groups at the beginning. 

My goal is to have the consumer fetch the correct group from a configuration center, allowing me to change the configuration without modifying any code or restarting the application. 

Currently, I am unsure how to use a dynamic service or change the group of a service dynamically. The only method I have found involves using `ReferenceConfig` to find providers in API mode. However, I prefer a configuration-based approach, as it is more readable and maintainable.

### Example
For example, I have multiple service implementations, each in a different group. I want the consumer to dynamically discover the correct group from the configuration center and be able to update the configuration without needing to modify the code or restart the application.

### Preferred Solution
I am looking for a way to achieve this through configuration rather than programmatically, as it would be more manageable and easier to understand.

Thank you for your assistance!
