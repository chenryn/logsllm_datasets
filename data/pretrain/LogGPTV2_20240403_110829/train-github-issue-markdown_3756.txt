### Environment
  * Dubbo version: 2.7.7
  * Operating System version: Mac OS
  * Java version: 1.8
  * Spring Boot 2.3.1.RELEASE
I'm in trouble how to dynamic find dubbo service providers.
Here is one example:
I have multiple implementations for the service, which is seperated by
different group. But I don't how many groups at the begining. I want the
consumer find the correct group from config center, and then I could change
the config without modify any code or restart the application.
But I don't know how to use a dynamic service, or change the group of a
service dynamically.
The only way I can find is using ReferenceConfig to find provider in api mode.
But I prefer a configration way, which is more readable and maintainable.
