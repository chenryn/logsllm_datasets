### Measurement Tool and Latency Analysis

We utilized the Scamper tool [20] to perform latency measurements using ICMP echo requests directed to the Google IPv4 Anycast DNS server at 8.8.8.8. Scamper was configured to store its Round-Trip Time (RTT) samples in an external file for subsequent analysis. Additionally, SoMeta was set up to collect RTT samples from the first three network hops, either through hop-limited probes or ICMP echo request probes, and to measure RTTs to 8.8.8.8.

### Experiment Setup

Simultaneously with running SoMeta, we introduced artificial system and network load in four different experiment types:
1. **CPU Load**: 100% CPU load on all cores.
2. **Memory System Load**: Cycling reads and writes over a large array.
3. **I/O Load**: Repeatedly writing to a file on the same filesystem as the output files generated by Scamper and SoMeta.
4. **Network Load**: Upload and download transfers of various file sizes (100KB, 1MB, and 10MB).

The artificial CPU, memory, and I/O loads were applied in an on-off cycle of 60 seconds each, starting with 60 seconds of no load followed by 60 seconds of load. The file transfers to introduce artificial network load were initiated every 10 seconds from a separate host, but using the same network path from the first router up through several network hops.

### Testbed and Deployment

For these experiments, we used the same testbed as in our overhead experiments described above. We also deployed a Raspberry Pi 3 (Pi3) in a home network connected to the Internet via a large cable modem provider. The Pi3 was either connected to the home router using a wired 100 Mb/s connection or via 802.11n WiFi.

### Results and Observations

#### Home Network Deployment via WiFi

Figure 4 shows the results for the Pi3 connected via WiFi to the router, with artificial CPU load. The plots display empirical Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs) of RTTs between the Pi3 and the first hop (home router), the second hop, and the target IP address 8.8.8.8. For each plot, CDFs are shown for all RTT measurements, as well as separate CDFs for the no artificial load periods (off) and when artificial CPU load is introduced (on). We observe that the artificial CPU load has a clear skewing effect on the latency measurements. An experimenter using SoMeta to detect subpar local conditions could:
1. Evaluate the CPU-related metadata to identify time periods with zero (or very little) idle CPU.
2. Compare (visually or statistically) the latency data generated during the experiment with data collected during known "good" time periods.

We note that the "off" curve from the left-hand plot of Figure 4 is virtually identical to a curve generated from a separate experiment with no artificial load (not shown).

#### Artificial Network Load Experiment

In Figure 5, we present results for the artificial network load experiment with the Pi3 again in the home network environment. The results are shown for file transfer sizes of 100KB, with the Pi3 connected to the home router via 1 Gb/s wired Ethernet. File transfers were initiated from a separate host connected via WiFi, sharing the same network path as the probes toward 8.8.8.8 for the first six hops.

The CDFs from measurements with no artificial load and those from the artificial network load experiment are shown, with a log scale on the x-axis. We observe that the first network hop is largely undisturbed, likely due to the different access technologies (wired Ethernet for the Pi3 and WiFi for the host). However, for subsequent hops, significant skewing is observed even with the transfer of a relatively small file. An experimenter can become aware of the local network disturbance by comparing newly collected data with measurements from known quiescent periods.

### Future Directions and Extensions

While SoMeta is currently decoupled from any specific measurement tool, we are considering an API through which measurement tools (or other data sources) could provide metadata to create a comprehensive, structured record of an experiment. This would facilitate documentation and scientific replication. The API could also support status/health polling and meta-API information for continuous assessment of system performance.

We are also exploring additional extensions to SoMeta, such as automatic identification and dynamic monitoring of file systems/disks and network interfaces, and performance improvements for constrained environments and shared measurement platforms. Whether SoMeta gains widespread use within the network measurement community, we hope our study renews the discussion on the role of metadata in assessing measurement quality and experiment reproduction.

### Summary and Future Work

Our current monitoring capabilities and the types of data SoMeta can collect are a starting point toward simplifying the collection and analysis of metadata for Internet measurement experiments. Our results show that even on devices with limited resources, such as the Pi1, the cost of collecting host performance and local network measures is low. The potential benefit of these measurements is high, as demonstrated by the differences in performance measures gathered during quiescent periods compared to those collected under artificial CPU, memory, I/O, or network load.

In ongoing work, we are considering using network latency measurements between a host and local network systems, explicitly collected during quiescent conditions, as a baseline reference for calibrating new measurements. This approach can help in detecting and possibly correcting shifts in network measurements, and in applying measurement quality labels based on additional collected data.
