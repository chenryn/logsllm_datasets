## Abstract
Internet anycast relies on inter-domain routing to direct clients to their "closest" sites. Using data collected from a root DNS server over a year (400M+ queries/day from 100+ sites), we characterize the load balancing and latency performance of global anycast. Our analysis reveals that site loads are often unbalanced, and many queries travel longer than necessary, with some exceeding 5000 km.

Investigating the root causes of these inefficiencies, we attribute path inflation to two primary factors. First, like unicast, anycast routes are influenced by inter-domain routing topology and policies, which can increase path length compared to the theoretical shortest (e.g., great-circle distance). Second, unlike unicast, anycast routes are affected by poor route selection when multiple sites are available, leading to an additional, unnecessary penalty.

Unfortunately, BGP does not provide information about the number or quality of reachable anycast sites. We propose an additional hint in BGP advertisements for anycast routes to enable ISPs to make better choices when multiple "equally good" routes are available. Our results show that using such routing hints can significantly reduce anycast path inflation, bringing its performance closer to that of unicast routing.

## 1 Introduction
Anycast is a fundamental mode of communication where a set of replicas serve the same content under a shared identifier. In IP anycast, server replicas at multiple geographic sites advertise the same IP address via BGP. Clients are routed to a replica based on underlying BGP routes, and from the client's perspective, all replicas offer an equivalent service [23, 31, 39]. This one-to-any form of communication is used in critical network infrastructure, such as root DNS servers and popular open resolvers [11, 12, 26, 44], and some content delivery networks (CDNs) use it to lower latencies and distribute load [7].

The appeal of IP anycast lies in the expectation that adding more replicas in locations with many clients will decrease overall client latency and more evenly distribute load [3, 7, 47]. However, inter-domain routing is not guaranteed to be optimal in terms of bandwidth, latency, or geographic proximity; BGP primarily ensures connectivity and policy compliance. Despite this, the increasing deployment of anycast in root DNS servers and open resolvers suggests that network operators expect these broad trends to apply.

Several studies have found that IP anycast's performance does not meet these basic expectations. Clients are often routed to distant replicas, resulting in increased latency [24, 28]. The inefficiency of IP anycast has been known for over a decade, yet there are few explanations or solutions. Ballani et al. [3, 4] proposed that deploying replicas with the same upstream provider could mitigate inefficiencies, but this would require cooperation from a large ISP, potentially introducing a single point of failure. Is this a fundamental limitation of anycast, or is there another solution?

In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of three distinct IP anycast deployments: C-, D-, and K-root DNS servers. We investigate the current inefficiencies of IP anycast, why it fails (and succeeds), and how to fix it without relying on a single large upstream provider. Our contributions are:

1. **Performance (§3)**: Using passive and active measurements of root DNS anycast deployments, we quantify the inefficiencies in terms of latency and load balance. We find that adding more anycast replicas often increases overall latency and exacerbates load balancing, matching clients to replicas in different continents.

2. **Problems (§4)**: We introduce a novel measurement technique to compare AS-level paths from clients to multiple anycast sites. The data indicate that the majority of performance inefficiency is due to BGP’s poor route selection, where routers often select distant, high-latency replicas over closer, low-latency ones.

3. **Potential (§5)**: Applying our findings, we propose including geographic hints in BGP advertisements to help routers more intelligently select routes among alternatives with equal preference. This reduces anycast path inflation to zero for over 65% of clients and is incrementally deployable.

Our results provide an accurate, in-depth understanding of why IP anycast currently does not work and how it can be improved. To assist practitioners and researchers, our non-sensitive datasets are publicly available [2].

## 2 Related Work
IP anycast [23, 31, 39] allows services to be transparently replicated across the Internet. Two of the most studied applications are root DNS servers [4, 13, 26, 27, 33, 45, 47] and CDNs [2, 6, 7, 14–16]. We focus on work that specifically studies root servers' use of IP anycast, rather than general DNS performance or availability [5, 38].

### Performance Measurements of IP Anycast
Several studies have compared RTTs between clients and their anycast replicas to the smallest RTT among all possible replicas [4, 13, 27, 45, 47]. Early studies indicated a promising trend towards lowered latency. Sarat et al. [45] and Colitti et al. [13] found small latency overheads in 2006. Lee et al. [25] observed a gradual decrease in latencies from 2007 through 2008, followed by an increase into 2009. Liang et al. [27] and Schmidt et al. [47] found that many resolvers experienced significant latency overheads, and having a few sites was enough to achieve nearly as good performance as having many sites. Our study shows that adding more replicas often harms performance by increasing latency, a phenomenon originally predicted by Ballani et al. [4].

### Explaining and Fixing IP Anycast Performance
Many measurement studies speculate that BGP routing impacts whether clients obtain their optimal replica, but offer no concrete explanation or fix. Sarat et al. [45] suggested that each anycast site has an announcement radius, but changing the advertisement radius does not ensure BGP selects the closest replica. Ballani et al. [3, 4] hypothesized that ensuring all replicas share a single upstream provider could remedy latency inflation. Our study confirms this hypothesis, but centralizing behind a large provider introduces a single point of failure. We propose a more democratic fix: adding static geographic hints to BGP, which can achieve similar benefits and is easily deployable.

## 3 Performance
We begin by studying the performance of Internet-wide anycast using measurements of DNS root servers. The DNS root is served by 13 addresses (A- through M-root), administered by various entities, and all are now served using anycast. Each address is anycast from different physical locations (sites), and the same root address may be anycast from different ASes. Each site may have multiple machines (replicas), which can be local (available only within the AS) or global (advertised using inter-domain BGP). As of early 2018, some roots are anycast from hundreds of global sites, while others have fewer than ten [44].

Fundamentally, we want to use our measurements to analyze the performance and identify inefficiencies in anycast deployments.
