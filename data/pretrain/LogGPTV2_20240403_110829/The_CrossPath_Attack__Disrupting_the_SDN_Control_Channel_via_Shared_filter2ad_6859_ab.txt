ating data trafﬁc and measuring the delay variations of the
control paths. To achieve the goal, our adversarial path re-
connaissance consists of two phases: measuring the delays
of control paths and identifying a target data path.
Measuring Delays of Control Paths. In SDN, packets that
cannot be matched in a switch will experience long forward-
ing paths and high delays, since they will be forwarded to the
controller to request ﬂow rules. We can analyze the delays
of these packets to calculate the delays of control paths that
share links with data paths. Assume there are two hosts hi
and h j, and the data path between them is a sequence of con-
secutive links Pi, j
>. Figure 2a

shows the forwarding path and delay for a packet that is sent
from hi to h j. The packet cannot be matched by ﬂow rules in
s1. We can know the end-to-end delay for the packet is:
, ... , lsω→h j
=  and s3 connects the controller via . Obviously, the data path from
h1 to h2 crosses with the control path of s3. However, an at-
tacker cannot identify it. Measuring the delay of the crossed
control paths is infeasible, since an adversary cannot trigger
rule installation into s3. If we consider another case where s2
connects the controller via  and s3
connects the controller via ,
, ls5→s6
the target data path from h1 to h2 crossing with the control
path of s2 can be identiﬁed. The main difference between

the two cases is whether the target data path crosses with a
control path of a switch belonging to the data path.
We consider a set of all the hosts in the target network
H = {h1, h2,
..., hn}, a set of compromised hosts ˜H =
{˜h1, ˜h2, ..., ˜hq}, and a set of all the switches in the net-
work S = {s1, s2, ..., sm}. Let pi, j
d be the data path from
host i to host j, let pi
c be the control path of switch i, and let
Si, j = {s1, s2, ..., sr} be the set of switches belonging to the
data path from host i to host j. Here, ˜H ⊂ H and Si, j ⊂ S. pi, j
d
and pi
c both is a set that contains a sequence of consecutive
links. In fact, we have the following theorem:
Theorem 1. If and only if the target SDN network meets
j ∈ ˜H, k ∈
the condition: ∃(pi
H and j (cid:8)= k, then there exists a target data path which can
be identiﬁed by the adversarial path reconnaissance.
(cid:8)= /0), where i ∈ S j,k,
c ∩ p j,k

Proof. We prove the theorem in two steps. We ﬁrst prove
the sufﬁcient condition, i.e., if the target network meets the
conditions in Theorem 1, then a target data path can be iden-
tiﬁed by the adversarial path reconnaissance. According to
the conditions, we can know that a data path p j,k
from a com-
d
promised host ˜h j to another host hk crosses with a control
path pi
c. The crossed control paths belong to the switches
S j,k along the data path. An attacker can conduct the adver-
sarial path reconnaissance on the data path. Basically, four
timing packets will be sent to the data path. The ﬁrst timing
packet will trigger rule installation into all switches along
the data path. Only after all switches ﬁnished installing rules
according to the messages of the controller, the packet can
reach the destination and a response packet will be sent to
the compromised host. Thus, the RTT of the timing packet
contains total latencies of control paths of all switches in S j,k.
The second timing packet will be sent after rule installation.
The total latencies of control paths can be obtained by sub-
tracting the RTTs of these two timing packets. After waiting
at least a timeout value, another two timing packets can be
sent to the data path with testing stream. The total laten-
cies of control paths can be obtained again in a similar way;
however, crossed control path pi
c will be affected by the test
stream. The reconnaissance will notice that the total laten-
cies will be signiﬁcantly higher than the previous latencies.
