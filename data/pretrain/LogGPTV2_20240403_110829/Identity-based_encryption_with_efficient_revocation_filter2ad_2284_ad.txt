One can verify that consistency follows directly from the
consistency of OT S and RIBE.
RIBECCA Security. We claim the following.
Theorem 5.1. Let G be a prime order bilinear group gen-
erator, OT S = (SGen, Sign, Ver) be a one-time signature
scheme and RIBE CCA[G,OT S] = (S(cid:5)
,R) be the associated Revocable IBE scheme as per con-
D(cid:5)
struction above. Then RIBE CCA[G,OT S] is sRID-CCA-
secure if the DBDH problem is hard for G and OT S is
strongly unforgeable.
,DK,E(cid:5)
, SK(cid:5)
,KU(cid:5)
,
The proof is in [3]. Here we provide some intuition. It is
not hard to show that RIBE CCA is sRID-CPA secure, the
security proof is very similar to the proof of Theorem 4.3.
Even though a ciphertext is encrypted under an additional
attribute: the veriﬁcation key, the key authority never is-
sues the corresponding decryption key component. To show
that RIBE CCA is also sRID-CCA secure, the simulator (the
DBDH adversary) needs to simulate the decryption oracle.
Using the arguments very similar to those used in [14] we
can show that the randomized check in the decryption algo-
rithm that the simulator can perform as well does guarantee
with overwhelming probability that a ciphertext was formed
correctly (according to the encryption algorithm). If the ad-
versary queries a ciphertext whose veriﬁcation key compo-
nent is the same as that of the challenge ciphertext, then the
decryption query cannot be answered correctly, but in this
case one can construct an adversary breaking security of the
one-time signature scheme. If the veriﬁcation keys are dif-
ferent, then the simulator can generate the decryption key
corresponding to identity and veriﬁcation key of the queried
ciphertext and decrypt the ciphertext. Generating such a
decryption key is possible because the veriﬁcation key is dif-
ferent from the challenge veriﬁcation key, and following the
proof of security of Fuzzy IBE, it is possible for the sim-
ulator to generate valid keys for a set of attributes if they
overlap with the challenge set of attributes in fewer than the
threshold number of attributes.
We note that alternatively we could use simulation-sound
NIZK proofs in a way similar to the construction of CCA
secure Fuzzy IBE in [24], but our construction is more eﬃ-
cient.
Generic CCA construction. The Fujisaki-Okamoto (or
FO for short) transform [11, 10] is a generic transform to
convert a CPA secure public key encryption scheme to a
CCA secure one in the RO model. The transform can also be
applied to IBE schemes as shown in [27, 17]. Here we show
how to apply the FO transform to Revocable IBE schemes.
Unlike the previous approach, this solution is generic in that
it applies to any Revocable IBE scheme. If applied to our
construction (the only secure Revocable IBE scheme cur-
rently known), then we suggest to use its more eﬃcient RO
modiﬁcation we discussed, since the FO transform also relies
on the RO model.
Let RIBE = (S,SK,KU ,DK, E ,D,R) be any Revocable
IBE scheme as per Deﬁnition 3.1. Then we can construct
another Revocable IBE scheme FO-RIBE CCA = (S(cid:5)
, SK,
KU , DK,E(cid:5)
,R) as follows (we only specify the diﬀer-
ences from RIBE). Let M,M(cid:5)
be the message spaces of
RIBE , FO-RIBE CCA resp. Let COINS be the set from
where E draws its random coins. We require that for every
m ∈ M, rand ∈ COINS we have that m(cid:3)rand ∈ M(cid:5)
. To
$←
make the use of randomness explicit we use notation rand
COINS ; E (·,·, ·,·; rand) as opposed to the traditional short-
hand E (·,·,·, ·). The setup algorithm S(cid:5)
(1κ, n) follows S. In
addition, it speciﬁes a hash function H(cid:5)
: M → COINS and
outputs it as part of public parameters pk
. The encryption
and decryption algorithms are as follows.

Consistency follows from the justiﬁcation of the consis-

FO-RIBE CCA Security. We now present the formal se-
curity statement for FO-RIBE CCA.
Theorem 5.2. Let RIBE be a Revocable IBE scheme as
per Deﬁnition 3.1, with message space M, and set of coins
COINS for its encryption algorithm. Let H(cid:5)
be a hash func-
tion mapping M to COINS be a hash function (modeled as
the RO) and FO-RIBE CCA be the associated Revocable IBE
scheme as per construction above. Then FO-RIBE CCA is
sRID-CCA-secure in the RO model if RIBE is sRID-CPA
secure.
The proof follows closely the proof of Theorem 1 in [27]
and the proof of Theorem 4.3 and is in the full version [3].
6. REVOCABLE ABE AND FUZZY IBE
Key-policy attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE) [15] is
a generalization of Fuzzy IBE which allows the authority to
specify more advanced decryption policies. In KP-ABE, as
in Fuzzy IBE, each ciphertext is labeled by the sender with
a set of descriptive attributes. However, each private key is
associated with an access tree that speciﬁes which type of ci-
phertexts the key can decrypt. A particular key can decrypt
a particular ciphertext only if the ciphertext attributes sat-
isfy the access tree of the key. The problem of revocation
of attributes is as relevant to KP-ABE as the problem of
identity revocation is relevant for IBE. There is no solution
known other than the frequent key update for all attributes.
As we explained in the Introduction this solution does not
scale well. We extend our ideas to construct a key-policy
attribute-based encryption with eﬃcient revocation or sim-
ply Revocable KP-ABE. Here we just explain how we obtain
a Revocable KP-ABE and that will imply a Revocable Fuzzy
IBE as well.
The construction uses the KP-ABE construction from [15]
and a binary tree in the following way. Messages are en-
crypted with attributes γ and time, where γ is the set of
attributes which is used in encryption in KP-ABE. The root
node of the access tree of decryption key is a 2-out-of-2 gate
whose one child is time (similarly to Revocable IBE) and the
other child is the root node of access tree A. The component
of decryption key corresponding to A and time are called pri-
vate key and key update, respectively. Private key for access
tree A is computed in the same way as keys are computed
in KP-ABE except that, instead of the root polynomial of
A, the root polynomial of decryption key evaluates to the
master key at 0. The use of binary tree is essentially the
same in both Revocable IBE and Revocable KP-ABE e.g.,
the way users are assigned to leaf nodes, the way polynomi-
als are selected for each node, the number of private keys
each user gets, the way key updates are computed etc. We
defer the formal description of Revocable KP-ABE and its
security to the full version of the paper [3].
7. CONCLUSIONS
We proposed an IBE scheme with eﬃcient revocation,
whose complexity of key updates is signiﬁcantly reduced
(from linear to logarithmic in the number of users) com-
pared to the previous solution. We discussed several vari-
ants achieving diﬀerent levels of security. We also discussed
how to construct an attribute-based encryption scheme with
eﬃcient revocation. Our schemes should be particularly use-
ful in the settings where a large number of users is involved
and scalability is an issue.
