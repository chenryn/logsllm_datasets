This might be just a question of precision. In the following code, A2 is a
singular matrix. NumPy calculates it's inverse and prints out a non-zero
determinant even though the matrix A2 is clearly singular:
A = array([[.1,.01,.3],[.2,.99,.3],[.7,0,.4]])  
I = identity(3)
A2 = A - I # this should be singular  
print inv(A2) # prints out a singular matrix(!!)  
print det(A2) # prints -2.33146835171e-18 instead of 0
