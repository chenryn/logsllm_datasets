    demoService.sayHello("hi");
  2. Start provider and then run consumer again, get null from the demoService.
    ReferenceConfigCache cache = ReferenceConfigCache.getCache();

Pls. provide [GitHub address] to reproduce this issue.
### Expected Result
DemoService should be initialized.
### Actual Result
DemoService returns null even with provider started.
For the first time, the ReferenceConfig init throws exception from
refprotocol.refer(interfaceClass, urls.get(0)), have not changed the
initialized to false. For the second time, the ReferenceConfig cannot init it
again as initialized is true.
We should set initialized after init finished.
