User:  How to check the disk space usage of a server so that it can be cleaned and optimized in time?
Assistant: You can check the disk space usage of a server by the following methods: 1. Use command line tools to check the disk space usage, such as df, du, etc. You can use the following command to view the disk usage and occupancy: ```sh df -h ``` This command can list the disk usage and display the free space capacity of the disk in an easy-to-read way. ```sh du -h --max-depth=1 ``` This command can list the size of subdirectories and files in the current directory, and display the size of each file and directory in an easy-to-read manner. 2. Regularly run automatic cleaning tools, such as cron, etc. You can free up disk space by automatically cleaning up unnecessary logs, files, etc. on a regular basis. 3. Regularly back up data and delete old data. Disk space can be freed by backing up data and deleting old data, and data security can be guaranteed. 4. Compress unnecessary files such as logs, backup files, etc. Compressing files reduces file size, which frees up disk space. 5. Use the disk cleanup tool to optimize the disk. You can use the Disk Cleanup tool to clean up useless and temporary files, and to defragment the disk.
