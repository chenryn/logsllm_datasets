Assistant: 1. 200 OK - The request is successful, and the server normally returns the requested data. 2. 404 Not Found - The server cannot find the requested resource, usually because the requested URL address is wrong or the resource has been deleted. 3. 400 Bad Request - The server cannot process the request because it does not conform to the syntax rules. 4. 500 Internal Server Error - The server encountered an unexpected error while processing the request. 5. 301 Moved Permanently - The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL address and should be accessed using the new URL address.
