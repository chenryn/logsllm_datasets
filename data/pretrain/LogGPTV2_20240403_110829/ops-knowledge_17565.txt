User: I am deciding whether to install python 3.4 or 2.7 on my home server running Ubuntu Server 14.04.2. I want to ensure that it has support from all the most used python libraries (scipy, numpy, requests, etc) but I am not sure how many of these packages fully support 3.4.
Do all 2.7 packages work on 3.4? If no, what are the differences between the two that causes this errors?
Assistant: No, only packages specifically written to support both Python 2 and 3 will run on either.
It is possible to write polyglot Python, but this requires effort from the library author. Code written for Python 2.7 will not automatically work on Python 3.
