Question: Consider the following code snippet for a web application using a Microsoft Access database:

sql
Dim query As String
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + inputUsername + "' AND password = '" + inputPassword + "'"


Which of the following statements correctly identifies a security issue with this code?
"A": "The code is secure because it uses string concatenation to construct the SQL query, which is a recommended practice for Microsoft Access databases.",
"B": "Using dynamic SQL constructed from user input without proper sanitization exposes the application to SQL injection attacks.",
"C": "The code is secure as Microsoft Access automatically provides protection against SQL injection through its built-in security features.",
"D": "The use of 'SELECT *' in the SQL query is the primary security issue as it may lead to an SQL injection attack."
Answer: B
