Rust code on SO right now looks pretty nasty. Most egregiously it interprets
the lifetime syntax as the start of a string, yielding hilarious results.
Here's the project that SO uses to highlight code:
https://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/
It has no "Rust" option, so I have no idea what language SO is currently using
to highlight our code. Implement proper Rust support, and once it's accepted
into Prettify we'll try to contact SO to get them to update their version.
