## Abstract
Existing anonymity systems, such as Tor, face two primary challenges that undermine user trust: the lack of consideration for trust relationships between users and relays, and the reliance on centralized servers. This paper introduces Pisces, a decentralized protocol for anonymous communication that leverages social network connections to build circuits for onion routing. We argue that this approach significantly enhances the system's resilience against attackers.

A fundamental challenge in this setting is the secure discovery of peers for circuit construction. Existing solutions for secure peer discovery are not applicable to unstructured social network topologies. In Pisces, we use random walks with a bias away from highly connected nodes to prevent a few nodes from dominating the circuit creation process. To secure these random walks, we introduce the reciprocal neighbor policy, which allows honest nodes to reciprocally exclude malicious nodes if they attempt to exclude honest nodes. We describe a fully decentralized protocol for enforcing this policy and use it to build the Pisces anonymity system.

Through theoretical modeling and experiments on real-world social network topologies, we demonstrate that:
1. The reciprocal neighbor policy mitigates active attacks.
2. Our decentralized protocol for enforcing this policy is secure and has low overhead.
3. The overall anonymity provided by Pisces significantly outperforms existing approaches.

## 1. Introduction
Anonymity systems, such as Anonymizer.com, AN.ON, and Tor, enhance user privacy by hiding the link between the user and their remote communicating parties. Tor, used by hundreds of thousands of users, including journalists, dissidents, and government embassies, forwards user traffic through a path of proxy servers. However, an attacker could control a substantial fraction of these proxies, compromising the anonymity of users. Thus, the security of the system depends on the presence of honest proxies.

Recently, Johnson et al. proposed incorporating trust into a Tor-like system, but their approach relies on central servers and has limited scalability. Nagaraja and Danezis et al. described leveraging social relationships in a decentralized anonymity system, but their protocols are vulnerable to route capture attacks by Byzantine adversaries.

### Contributions
In this paper, we propose using social networks to construct circuits that are more robust to compromise than any prior approach in decentralized anonymity systems. We leverage the fact that, when protected from manipulation, random walks on social network topologies are likely to remain among honest users. We then build circuits from these protected random walks, ensuring a high chance of honest circuits even for users with few social links to malicious peers.

To prevent the adversary from biasing the random walk, we introduce the reciprocal neighbor policy. If malicious nodes try to exclude honest nodes during peer discovery, honest nodes can reciprocally exclude the malicious nodes from their routing tables. This policy ensures that attempts to bias the random walk towards malicious nodes reduce the probability of those nodes being selected, nullifying the attack. Additionally, we bias random walks away from highly connected nodes to prevent the formation of large cliques of malicious peers.

We also present a technique for enforcing the reciprocal neighbor policy in a fully decentralized manner. Each node's current list of contacts is efficiently distributed and verified periodically. A contact not in the list can permanently remove the node from its contacts. The list is signed by the node, providing proof of cheating if conflicting lists exist.

Using theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments, we show that our application of the reciprocal neighbor policy provides good deterrence against active attacks. Our distributed design robustly enforces this policy with manageable overhead. Finally, using real-world social network topologies, we demonstrate that Pisces provides significantly higher anonymity than existing approaches.

## 2. Background and Related Work
### 2.1 Centralized/Semi-Centralized Approaches
Most deployed anonymity systems, such as Anonymizer, AN.ON, and Tor, have a centralized or semi-centralized architecture. These systems are vulnerable to compromise, eavesdropping, and denial of service attacks. Tor, while more distributed, does not leverage user trust relationships and relies on trusted directory authorities, which are attractive targets for attack.

### 2.2 Incorporating Social Trust
Leveraging social network trust relationships has been recognized as a way to improve the security and privacy of systems. Johnson et al. proposed incorporating trust into a Tor-like system, but their approach relies on central servers. Nagaraja and Danezis et al. proposed anonymity systems over social networks, but these are vulnerable to route capture attacks. Designing systems that are aware of users' trust relationships is crucial for defending against Sybil attacks, where a single entity emulates multiple identities.

### 2.3 Decentralized and Peer-to-Peer Approaches
Several distributed directory services for anonymous communication have been designed using a P2P approach, but most have serious problems preventing deployment. Crowds uses a centralized directory service, and Tarzan does not scale well. MorphMix, the first scalable P2P anonymity system, uses random walks on unstructured topologies but is vulnerable to routing table manipulation. Recent protocols like AP3, Salsa, NISAN, and Torsk are vulnerable to information leak attacks. ShadowWalker, based on DHTs, is partially broken and remains vulnerable to route captures. Pisces addresses these issues by securing random walks in unstructured social network topologies using new techniques such as the reciprocal neighbor policy and Metropolis-Hastings random walks.
