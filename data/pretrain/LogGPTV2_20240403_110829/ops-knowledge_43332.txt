User: I seem to be in a never ending tail spin of Linux, or not, Windows or not. Web programming or system programming. Python or PHP.
I'am self teaching myself programming. But it seems I keep being torn about which way to go. Unfortunately it is always seemingly good reasons to get side tracked. You know the whole open source or proprietary thing. Lately I have decided after a year that Linux just doesn't cut it for me and it mostly stems from me wanting to watch videos on Channel 9 etc, and the clunkiness that is Linux. So that lead me to, "Should I learn ASP.NET, since I am more so deciding Windows IS a "necessary" evil.
I hope this made sense. The reason I settled in on Web Development as my course to learning programming is because I actually have a task to implement rather then aimlessly reading reference books etc.
Does anyone have any advice at what they may have done to stay focused and not get lead down every tangent or idea.
Assistant: Thanks for the thoughtful responses
That seemed to be another distraction from learning programming for me anyway. I spent more time chasing apparent fixes for upgraded packages and such. Mostly things that were already working and it just seemed to not make much sense to spend time recreating the wheel so to speak. Believe me the jury is still out for ma as to whether it makes good sense to chase the dream of Linux as a real alternative to a usable desktop. Now remember ex-Windows users will always have to compare their experience with Linux to how they were previously able to work before trying Windows.
Just my two cents
