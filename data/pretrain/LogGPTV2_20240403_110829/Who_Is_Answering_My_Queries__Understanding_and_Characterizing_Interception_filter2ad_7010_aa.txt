**Abstract:**
DNS queries from end users are typically handled by recursive DNS servers for scalability. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) often automatically assign these recursive servers when clients use default network settings. However, users should have the flexibility to choose their preferred recursive servers, such as public DNS services. This trust can be compromised by on-path devices that intercept DNS queries, a phenomenon we term "DNSIntercept." These devices can spoof the IP addresses of user-specified DNS servers, leading to privacy and security issues.

In this paper, we conduct a large-scale analysis of on-path DNS interception, providing insights into its scope and characteristics. We design novel methods to detect DNS interception and analyze data from 148,478 residential and cellular IP addresses worldwide. Our findings show that 259 out of 3,047 Autonomous Systems (ASes) (8.5%) exhibit DNS interception behavior, including major providers like China Mobile. Furthermore, we find that the DNS servers used by these ASes often run outdated, vulnerable software (deprecated before 2009) and lack security features such as DNSSEC support. Our work highlights the significant issues surrounding on-path DNS interception and provides new insights for addressing these problems.

**1. Introduction:**
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a critical service for internet applications, translating human-readable names into numerical IP addresses. DNS failures can severely impact the user experience. Previous studies have shown that rogue DNS resolvers, transparent proxies, and unauthorized root servers can compromise the integrity and availability of internet communication.

This paper investigates an emerging issue: the hidden interception of the DNS resolution path (DNSIntercept) by on-path devices. While recursive nameservers improve performance and reduce traffic congestion, they are often assigned by ISPs. Users should have the option to choose their own DNS servers, such as Google Public DNS (8.8.8.8). However, we find that on-path devices intercept DNS queries sent to public DNS servers and respond with answers resolved by alternative recursive nameservers, spoofing the IP addresses of the user-specified servers. This makes it difficult for users to detect the manipulation.

DNS interception can serve various purposes, such as displaying advertisements, collecting statistics, or blocking malware connections. However, it raises ethical concerns, increases the risk of trusting poorly maintained alternative DNS servers, and can break security features like DNSSEC.

**2. Challenges and Approach:**
We face two main challenges in analyzing DNSIntercept:
1. **Data Collection:** Acquiring a diverse set of clients across different Autonomous Systems (ASes) for large-scale measurement.
2. **Detection:** Verifying whether DNS queries reach the intended recursive nameservers, given that on-path devices can spoof IP addresses.

To address these challenges, we developed a new measurement methodology and conducted two large-scale experiments:
- **Global Analysis:** Using a residential proxy network with 36,173 unique IP addresses across 173 countries.
- **China-wide Analysis:** Collaborating with a security company to obtain DNS traffic from 112,305 IP addresses (across 356 ASes) within China.

We registered domains and used authoritative nameservers to monitor DNS queries. Clients were instructed to send DNS packets to public DNS servers and query nonce subdomains. By checking the IP addresses that queried our subdomains, we could determine if the DNS resolution was intercepted.

**3. Findings:**
- **Prevalence:** Among 3,047 ASes, 259 (8.5%) exhibited DNS interception, including major providers like China Mobile. Additionally, 27.9% of DNS requests over UDP from China to Google Public DNS were intercepted.
- **Traffic Type:** DNS queries over UDP and those for A-type records sent to well-known public DNS services were more likely to be intercepted.
- **Security Concerns:** Intercepted DNS servers often used outdated software, with 97 servers running old BIND versions (deprecated after 2009), and 57% did not support DNSSEC.
- **Performance Impact:** DNSIntercept provided limited performance improvement, with 15.37% of UDP DNS traffic to public DNS services being faster than responses from alternative DNS servers.

**4. Contributions:**
- **Understanding:** We systematically measured DNSIntercept, which spoofs the IP addresses of user-specified DNS servers to intercept DNS traffic.
- **Methodology:** We designed novel approaches for large-scale analysis, using 148,478 residential and cellular IP addresses worldwide.
- **Findings:** Hidden interception behaviors were found in major ASes, including China Mobile. The DNS servers used by interceptors had poor security maintenance and were vulnerable to attacks.
- **Tool:** We released an online tool (http://whatismydnsresolver.com) to help users detect DNSIntercept.

**5. Threat Model and Mechanisms:**
- **Domain Resolution Process:** DNS is a hierarchical system that resolves domain names into IP addresses. Recursive resolvers handle initial queries, contacting root, TLD, and SLD nameservers.
- **Threat Model:** On-path devices intercept and manipulate DNS requests, redirecting them to alternative resolvers and spoofing the source addresses to make the interception appear legitimate.
- **Scope of Study:** We focused on how DNS resolution paths between clients and public DNS resolvers are tampered with, excluding other types of network traffic manipulation.
- **Taxonomy of DNS Resolution Paths:**
  - **Normal Resolution:** Queries follow the standard process without modification.
  - **Request Redirection:** Original queries are dropped, and an alternative resolver is used.
  - **Request Replication:** Queries are replicated and handled by both the specified and an alternative resolver.
  - **Direct Responding:** Queries are redirected to an alternative resolver, which responds directly without contacting other nameservers.

**6. Potential Interceptors:**
- **Network Operators (ISPs):** Deploy on-path devices to intercept DNS traffic.
- **Censors and Firewalls:** Manipulate DNS queries to block access to certain websites.
- **Malware and Anti-Virus Software:** Can change DNS resolver configurations or intercept DNS queries for security reasons.

**Conclusion:**
Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of DNSIntercept, highlighting its prevalence, security risks, and performance implications. We offer new insights and tools to help address this growing concern in internet security.
