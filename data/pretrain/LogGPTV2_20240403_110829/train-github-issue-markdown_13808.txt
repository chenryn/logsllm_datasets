I stumbled upon these two comments while perusing the base linalg code.
Related statement in #23914, where they were introduced:
> Also marked a few even more invalid places where managed pointer is passed
> to unsafe_wrap (the fix for those will be much more involved).
Not terribly reassuring seeing this in production code, so I figured it
deserved an open issue.
