While reviewing the `LinearAlgebra` module in Julia's standard library, I encountered the following comments in the `matmul.jl` file:

- **File:** `julia/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/src/matmul.jl`
- **Line 536 (Commit 54adf21):**
  ```julia
  # FIXME: This code is completely invalid!!!
  ```

- **Line 558 (Commit 54adf21):**
  ```julia
  # FIXME: This code is completely invalid!!!
  ```

These comments were introduced in [PR #23914](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/23914), where the author noted:
> "Also marked a few even more invalid places where managed pointer is passed to `unsafe_wrap` (the fix for those will be much more involved)."

Finding such critical issues in production code is concerning. Therefore, I believe it is important to create an open issue to address these problems.
