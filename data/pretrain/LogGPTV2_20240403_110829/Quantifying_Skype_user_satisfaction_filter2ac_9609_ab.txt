Skype adjusts the voice quality by two orthogonal dimen-
sions: the frame size (30–60 ms according to the iSAC white
paper), and the encoding bit rate. The frame size directly
decides the sending rate of voice packets; for example, 300
out of 462 sessions use a frame size of 30 ms in both di-
rections, which corresponds to about 33 packets per second.
Because packets may be delayed or dropped in the network,
we do not have exact information about the source rate of
remote Skype hosts, i.e., nodes outside the monitored net-
work. Assuming the loss rate is within a reasonable range,

Session time (minutes)
Figure 2: Survival curves for sessions with diﬀerent
bit rate levels
say less than 5%, we use the received data rate as an ap-
proximation of the source rate. We ﬁnd that packet rates
and bit rates are highly correlated (with a correlation coef-
ﬁcient ≈ 0.82); however, they are not perfectly proportional
because packet sizes vary. To be concise, in the following,
we only discuss the eﬀect of the bit rate because 1) it has a
higher correlation with call duration; and, 2) although not
shown, the packet rate has a similar (positive) correlation
with session time.
We begin with a fundamental question: “Does call dura-
tion diﬀer signiﬁcantly with diﬀerent bit rates?” To answer
this question, we use the estimated survival functions for ses-
sions with diﬀerent bit rates. In Fig. 2, the survival curves
of three session groups, divided by 25 Kbps (15%) and 35
Kbps (60%), are plotted. The median session time of groups
1 and 3 are 2 minutes and 20 minutes, respectively, which
gives a high ratio of 10. We can highlight this diﬀerence in
another way: while 30% of calls with bit rates > 35 Kbps
last for more than 40 minutes, only 3% of calls hold for the
same duration with low bit rates ( 2 Kbps
2(t): 1  40 Kbps).
4.3 Effect of Network Conditions
In addition to the source rate, network conditions are also
considered to be one of the primary factors that aﬀect voice
quality. In order not to disturb the conversation of the Skype
users, the RTT probes (cf. Section 3.4) were sent at 1 Hz,
a frequency that is too low to capture delay jitters due to
queueing and packet loss. So we must seek some other met-
ric to grade the interference of the network. Given that
1) Skype generates VoIP packets regularly, and 2) the fre-
quency of VoIP packets is relatively high, so the ﬂuctuations
in the data rate observed at the receiver should reﬂect net-
work delay variations to some extent. Therefore, we use the
standard deviation of the bit rate sampled every second to
represent the degree of network delay jitters and packet loss.
For brevity, we use jitter to denote the standard deviation
of the bit rate, and packet rate jitter, or pr.jitter, to denote
the standard deviation of the packet rate.
4.3.1 Effect of Round-Trip Times
We divide sessions into three equal-sized groups based on
their RTTs, and compare their lifetime patterns with the
estimated survival functions. As a result, the three groups
diﬀer signiﬁcantly (p = 3.9e − 6). The median duration of
sessions with RTTs > 270 ms is 4 minutes, while sessions
with RTTs between 80 ms and 270 ms and sessions with
RTTs < 80 ms have median duration of 5.2 and 11 minutes,
respectively.
4.3.2 Effect of Jitter
We ﬁnd that variable jitter, which captures the level of
network delay variations and packet loss, has a much higher
correlation with call duration than round-trip times. As
shown in Fig. 4, the three session groups, which are divided
by jitters of 1 Kbps and 2 Kbps, have median time of 3, 11,
and 21 minutes, respectively. The p-value of the equivalence
test of these groups is 1 − Prχ2,2(154) ≈ 0. The correlation
plot, depicted in Fig. 5, shows a consistent and signiﬁcant

Jitter (Kbps)
Figure 5: Correlation of jitter with session time
downward trend in jitter versus time. Although not very
pronounced, the jitter seems to have a “threshold” eﬀect
when it is of low magnitude. That is, a negative correla-
tion between jitter and session time is only apparent when
the former is higher than 0.5 pkt/sec. Such threshold eﬀects,
often seen in factors that capture human behavior, are plau-
sible because listeners may not be aware of a small amount
of degradation in voice quality.
4.4 Regression Modeling
We have shown that most of the QoS factors we deﬁned,
including the source rate, RTT, and jitter, are related to call
duration. However, we note that correlation analysis does
not reveal the true impact of individual factors because of
the collinearity of factors. For example, given that the bit
rate and jitter are signiﬁcantly correlated (with p ≈ 2e− 6),
if both factors are related to call duration, which one is the
true source of user dissatisfaction is unclear. Users could
be particularly unhappy because of one of the factors, or be
sensitive to both of them.
To separate the impact of individual factors, we adopt
regression analysis to model call duration as the response
to QoS factors. Given that linear regression is inappropri-
ate for modeling call duration, we show that the Cox model
provides a statistically sound ﬁt for the collected Skype ses-
