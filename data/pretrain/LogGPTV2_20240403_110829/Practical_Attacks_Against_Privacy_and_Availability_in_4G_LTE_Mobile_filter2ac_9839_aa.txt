Abstract—Mobile communication systems are now an essential
part of life throughout the world. Fourth generation “Long
Term Evolution” (LTE) mobile communication networks are
being deployed. The LTE suite of speciﬁcations is considered
to be signiﬁcantly better than its predecessors not only in terms
of functionality but also with respect to security and privacy
for subscribers. We carefully analyzed LTE access network
protocol speciﬁcations and uncovered several vulnerabilities.
Using commercial LTE mobile devices in real LTE networks,
we demonstrate inexpensive, and practical attacks exploiting
these vulnerabilities. Our ﬁrst class of attacks consists of three
different ways of making an LTE device leak its location: In
our experiments, a semi-passive attacker can locate an LTE
device within a 2 km2 area in a city whereas an active attacker
can precisely locate an LTE device using GPS co-ordinates
or trilateration via cell-tower signal strength information. Our
second class of attacks can persistently deny some or all services
to a target LTE device. To the best of our knowledge, our work
constitutes the ﬁrst publicly reported practical attacks against LTE
access network protocols.
We present several countermeasures to resist our speciﬁc
attacks. We also discuss possible trade-off considerations that may
explain why these vulnerabilities exist. We argue that justiﬁcation
for these trade-offs may no longer valid. We recommend that
safety margins introduced into future speciﬁcations to address
such trade-offs should incorporate greater agility to accommodate
subsequent changes in the trade-off equilibrium.
INTRODUCTION
During the past
I.
two decades, mobile devices such as
smartphones have become ubiquitous. The reach of mobile
communication systems, starting from the second generation
Global System for Mobile Communications (2G/GSM) and the
third generation Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems
(3G/UMTS), has extended to every corner in the world. Mobile

communication is an important cornerstone in the lives of the
vast majority of people and societies on this planet. The latest
generation in this evolution, the fourth generation “Long Term
Evolution” (4G/LTE) systems are being deployed widely. By
the end of 2015 the worldwide LTE subscriber base is expected
to be around 1.37 billion [1].
Early 2G systems were known to have several vulnera-
bilities. For example, lack of mutual authentication between
mobile users and the network implied that it was possible for
an attacker to set up fake base stations and convince legitimate
mobile devices to connect to it. In order to minimize exposure
of user identiﬁers (known as International Mobile Subscriber
Identiﬁer or IMSI) in over-the-air signaling messages, 2G
systems introduced the use of temporary mobile subscriber
identiﬁers. However, in the absence of mutual authentication,
fake base stations were used as “IMSI catchers” to harvest
IMSIs and to track movements of users.
The evolution of these mobile communication systems
speciﬁed by 3GPP (Third Generation Partnership Project)
have not only incorporated improvements in functionality but
also strengthened security. 3G speciﬁcations introduced mutual
authentication and the use of stronger and well-analyzed cryp-
tographic algorithms. LTE speciﬁcations further strengthened
signaling protocols by requiring authentication and encryption
(referred to as “ciphering” in 3GPP terminology) in more
situations than was previously required. Consequently, there is
a general belief that LTE speciﬁcations provide strong privacy
and availability guarantees to mobile users. Previously known
attacks, such as the ability to track user movement were
thought to be difﬁcult in LTE.
In this paper, we demonstrate the ﬁrst practical attacks
against LTE access network protocols. Our attacks are based
on vulnerabilities we discovered during a careful analysis of
LTE access network protocol speciﬁcations. They fall into two
classes: location leaks and denial of service. In the ﬁrst class,
we describe three different attacks that can force an LTE
device (User Equipment or UE in 3GPP terminology) into
revealing its location. The ﬁrst two allow a passive or semi-
passive attacker to localize the target user within about a 2
km2 area in an urban setting which is a much ﬁner granularity
than previously reported location leak attacks [2] against 2G
devices, while still using similar techniques. Notably, we show
how popular social network messaging applications (e.g., Face-
book messenger [3] and WhatsApp [4]) can be used in such
attacks. Our third attack allows an active attacker exploiting
vulnerabilities in the speciﬁcation and implementation of LTE
Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol [5] to accurately
pinpoint the target user via GPS co-ordinates or trilateration
using base station signal strengths as observed by that UE. We
believe that all LTE devices in the market are vulnerable to
this attack.
In the second class, we describe three further attacks where
an active attacker can cause persistent denial of service against
a target UE. In the ﬁrst, the target UE will be forced into using
2G or 3G networks rather than LTE networks, which can then
make it possible to mount 2G/3G-speciﬁc attacks against that
UE. In the second, the target UE will be denied access to all
networks. In the last attack, the attacker can selectively limit a
UE only to some types of services (e.g., no voice calls). The
attacks are persistent and silent: devices require explicit user
action (such as rebooting the device) to recover.
We have implemented all our attacks (except one) and
conﬁrmed their effectiveness using commercial LTE devices
from several vendors and real LTE networks of several carriers.
The equipment needed for the attacks is inexpensive and
readily available. We reported our attacks to the manufacturers
and carriers concerned as well as to the standardization body
(3GPP). Remedial actions are under way while writing.
Speciﬁcation of a large system like LTE is a complex
endeavor involving many trade-offs among conﬂicting require-
ments. Rather than merely report on LTE vulnerabilities and
attacks, we also discuss possible considerations that may have
led to the vulnerabilities in the ﬁrst place. Based on this we
suggest some general guidelines for future standardization as
well as speciﬁc ﬁxes for our attacks.

II. OVERVIEW OF LTE ARCHITECTURE
We brieﬂy describe LTE infrastructure as well as security
and paging mechanisms to assist readers in understanding the
vulnerabilities and attacks we present in this paper.
A. LTE infrastructure
We consider a simpliﬁed LTE architecture involving com-
ponents required to set up access network protocols between
a base station and mobile devices. We hide other details of
the architecture which are not relevant from the point of view
of understanding our attacks. Figure 1 depicts this simpliﬁed
architecture which contains three main components: User
Equipment (UE), Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access
Network (E-UTRAN), and Evolved Packet Core (EPC). All
three components are collectively referred to as Evolved Packet
System (EPS) according to 3GPP terminology. In the interest
of simplicity, throughout this paper we refer to the whole
system as LTE. The three components are described below
(A list of common acronyms related to LTE appear in the full
version of this paper [6]).
Fig. 1. LTE system architecture
User Equipment: UE refers to the actual communication
device which can be, for example, a smartphone . A UE
contains a USIM (Universal Subscriber Identity Module)[7],
which represents the IMSI and stores the corresponding au-
thentication credentials [8]. This IMSI is used to identify an
LTE user (generally referred to as “subscriber” in 3GPP ter-
minology) uniquely. The USIM participates in LTE subscriber
authentication protocol and generates cryptographic keys that
form the basis for the key hierarchy subsequently used to
protect signaling and user data communication between the
UE and base stations over the radio interface.
E-UTRAN: E-UTRAN consists of base stations. It manages
the radio communication with the UE and facilitates commu-
nication between the UE and EPC. In LTE, a base station
is technically referred as “evolved NodeB (eNodeB)”. The
eNodeB uses a set of access network protocols, called Access
Stratum (AS) for exchanging signaling messages with its UEs.
These AS messages include Radio Resource control (RRC)
protocol messages. Other functions of eNodeB include paging
UEs, over-the-air security, physical layer data connectivity, and
handovers. Each eNodeB is connected to the EPC through an
interface named S1.
MME in EPC: EPC provides core network functionalities by
a new all-IP mobile core network designed for LTE systems. It
consists of several new elements as deﬁned in [9]. However, for
2
our work we need to describe only the Mobility Management
Entity (MME) in detail. MME is responsible for authenticating
and allocating resources (data connectivity) to UEs when
they connect to the network. Other important functions of
MME involve security (setting up integrity and encryption for
signaling) [10] and tracking UE’s location at a macro level.
The set of protocols run between UE and MME are referred
as Non-Access Stratum (NAS).
Now, we explain how the system components presented
above can be deployed in a geographical region (e.g., in a
city) by mobile network carriers (more commonly referred to
as “operators” in 3GPP terminology) to provide LTE services.
A service area of a mobile operator is geographically divided
into several regions known as Tracking Areas (TAs). TAs are
similar to Location Areas in GSM networks and are managed
by the MME. Further, a TA contains a group of “cells”1
each of which is controlled by an eNodeB. The eNodeB
broadcasts operator-speciﬁc information such as Tracking Area
Code (TAC), Mobile Country Code (MCC), Mobile Network
Code (MNC), and cell ID via System Information Block
(SIB) messages [5]. This allows UEs to identify their serving
network operator, and initiate a connection to the network.
A UE attaches to the network by initiating the Attach
procedure [11]. Upon successful acceptance the UE receives
access to services based on its subscription. The UE uses
the T rackingAreaU pdate(T AU ) procedure to inform the
network about its mobility in the serving area [11].
B. Security in LTE
As IMSI is a permanent identiﬁer of a subscriber, LTE
speciﬁcations try to minimize its transmission in over-the-
air radio communication for security and privacy reasons.
Instead, a Globally Unique Temporary Identiﬁer (GUTI) [8]
is used to identify subscribers during radio communication. It
is assigned to UEs during Attach and may be periodically
changed to provide temporal unlinkability of trafﬁc to/from
the same UE. An Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA)
protocol is used for mutual authentication between UE and the
network and to agree on session keys that provide integrity
and conﬁdentiality protection for subsequent NAS and AS
messages [10]. Both NAS and AS security are collectively
referred as EPS security. It is established between a UE and a
serving network domain (eNodeB and MME) during EMM
(EPS Mobility Management) procedures [11] and includes
agreeing on session keys, preferred cryptographic algorithms,
and other values as deﬁned in [10].
C. Paging in LTE
Paging refers to the process used when MME needs to
locate a UE in a particular area and deliver a network service,
such as incoming calls. Since MME may not know the exact
eNodeB to which UE is connected,
it generates a paging
message and forwards to all eNodeBs in a TA. Simultaneously,
MME starts a paging timer (T3413) and expects a response
from UE before this timer expires. Thus, all eNodeBs present
in the paged TA broadcast a RRC paging message to locate
Fig. 2. Paging in LTE
the UE. Paging messages contain identities of UEs such as S-
TMSI(s) or IMSI(s). S-TMSI is a temporary identiﬁer (SAE-
Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity). It is part of a GUTI.
For the sake of simplicity, we consistently use the term GUTI
throughout the rest of this paper even when referring to S-
TMSI. Figure 2 highlights LTE paging procedure, described
in detail in the relevant LTE speciﬁcations [11], [12], [13].
The UE in IDLE state2 decodes RRC paging messages. If
it detects its IMSI then it initiates a new Attach procedure to
receive a GUTI as deﬁned in [11]. If UE detects its GUTI,
