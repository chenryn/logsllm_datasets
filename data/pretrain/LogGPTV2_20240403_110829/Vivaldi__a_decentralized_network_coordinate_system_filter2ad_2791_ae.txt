# Vivaldi: A Decentralized Algorithm for Computing Synthetic Coordinates for Internet Hosts

## 1. Introduction
Vivaldi is a decentralized algorithm designed to compute synthetic coordinates for Internet hosts, enabling accurate latency predictions. Unlike other systems, Vivaldi does not require a fixed infrastructure and can adapt to changes in the network. This paper evaluates Vivaldi's performance on large datasets and proposes a new model, height vectors, to improve its accuracy.

## 2. Cumulative Distribution of Prediction Error
Figure 14 shows the cumulative distribution of prediction errors for spherical coordinates with various radii chosen by Vivaldi for the PlanetLab and King datasets.

- **PlanetLab (a)**
  - Spherical coordinates: r = 40ms, 60ms, 80ms, 100ms, 120ms
  - 2D representation

- **King (b)**
  - Spherical coordinates: r = 40ms, 60ms, 80ms, 100ms, 120ms
  - 2D representation

Relative error values are plotted on the y-axis, while the x-axis represents the relative error values from 0 to 3.

## 3. Node Placement and Height Vectors
Brazilian nodes are assigned coordinates approximately 95 ms above the United States. Traceroute data confirms that this distance corresponds to the connection to the backbone of the Internet2 network within the U.S. The use of height vectors results in smaller maximum and median errors, suggesting they better reflect the Internet's structure.

### 3.1 Graphical Comparison
Figure 16 illustrates the final placement of nodes in two and three-dimensional Euclidean space and with height vectors. The Euclidean plots show a cloud of nodes far from others, leading to large errors. In contrast, height vectors place these nodes high above the rest, reducing errors.

## 4. Related Work
Several systems have been proposed for computing synthetic coordinates, but Vivaldi stands out due to its decentralization and adaptability.

### 4.1 Centralized Coordinate Systems
- **GNP [17]**: Uses landmark nodes; accuracy depends on landmark selection.
- **NPS [16]**: Extends GNP with hierarchical load reduction and security measures.
- **Lighthouse [19]**: Scalable extension of GNP, allowing new nodes to query existing ones.
- **Tang and Crovella [29]**: Propose virtual landmarks, showing low-dimensional coordinates effectively model Internet latencies.

### 4.2 Decentralized Internet Coordinate Systems
- **PIC [3]**: Similar to Vivaldi but lacks continuous certainty measures and dynamic adaptability.
- **NPS [16]**: Decentralized, with each landmark re-running minimization independently.

- **Mithos [24, 30]**: Assigns location-aware IDs using spring relaxation.
- **Big Bang [26]**: Simulates potential fields, requiring global knowledge.

## 5. Conclusions and Future Work
Vivaldi is a simple, adaptive, and decentralized algorithm for computing synthetic coordinates. It requires no fixed infrastructure and supports a wide range of communication patterns. The height vector model improves latency predictions and should be useful for other coordinate algorithms. Future work includes comparing height vectors and hyperbolic models to determine the best representation of the Internet.
