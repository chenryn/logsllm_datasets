User: In the field of operation and maintenance, what is CI/CD? Please explain what it means and provide a practical example.
Assistant: CI/CD is a software development process model where CI stands for Continuous Integration and CD stands for Continuous Deployment or Continuous Delivery, which are different steps in the automated software release process. Continuous integration refers to the automation of code integration and compilation in the software development process to ensure that errors can be detected in time and quickly corrected every time the code is submitted. Continuous deployment/delivery is the process of implementing automated deployment and testing based on continuous integration, in which committed code is automatically built, tested, and automatically deployed to one or more environments. Doing so can greatly shorten the development cycle and reduce the probability of error. A practical example is that during the development of a web application, developers use Git to manage version control and use Jenkins for automated construction and automated testing. After the test is completed, the code is automatically deployed to a pre-release environment and after a certain period of time After the risk assessment, go into the production environment. This process is known as continuous integration and continuous deployment/delivery. Doing so speeds up software development while reducing the probability of errors and risks like production failures.
