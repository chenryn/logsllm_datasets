**ATT&CK ID: G0016**  
**ATT&CK Technique Name: APT29**

APT29, a well-known advanced persistent threat (APT) group, has been observed using a backdoor that creates a Tor hidden service. This hidden service forwards traffic from the Tor client to local ports 3389 (RDP), 139 (NetBIOS), and 445 (SMB). By doing so, it enables full remote access to the compromised system from outside the network. Additionally, APT29 has been known to use the Tor network for other malicious activities.[3][4]
