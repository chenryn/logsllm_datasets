User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to search for text in a PuTTY console window Is there a easy way for me to:


search for a string in the output window of the putty ?
or even a Linux command to search and highlight a string in the output ?


I have 20,000+ lines in the output and sometimes I have to search for customer_id : 1111 and currently I have to copy them to word or notepad and then search.

Is there a better way to do this ?

Assistant: I use a very clever trick (if I do say so).  

Answer is NO, putty can't do a find in the scroll back buffer.  

Here's my workaround:

I enable putty session logging, and then have the session log open in GxTail, which is a text viewer that updates in real time.  I have the windows open side by side (or one on each monitor), and when I issue a command in putty, the output is in the GxTail window.  GxTail has full find (ctrl-f) like any text editor.

It's the next best thing to having ctrl-f working in putty.  Works great for long cisco running-configs, where the | inc pipe command has shortcomings.
