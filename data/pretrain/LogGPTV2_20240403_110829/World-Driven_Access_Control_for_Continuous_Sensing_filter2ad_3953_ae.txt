track objects today (e.g., RFIDs, Bluetooth IDs, MAC ad-
dresses), and hence consider the issue out of scope.
Finally, as described, world-driven access control can use
diverse mechanisms to communicate policies. We imple-
mented and evaluated several approaches for explicitly com-
municating policies, and we encourage further study of other
approaches. For example, our design is general enough to
encompass implicitly communicated policies. Implicit poli-
cies may rely on improved computer vision (e.g., to recog-
nize sensitive locations, as in PlaceAvoider [39]) or be in-
ferred from natural human behavior (e.g., closing a door or
whispering). Other examples of work in this area are Le-
gion:AR [21], which uses a panel of humans to recognize ac-
tivities, and work on predicting the cost of interruption from
sensors [17]. Additionally, to improve policy detection accu-
racy, systems may include additional policy-speciﬁc sensors,
such as cameras, whose sole purpose is to sense policies, al-
lowing them to be lower-power than user-facing sensors [23].
8. ADDITIONAL RELATED WORK
We have discussed inline prior works that consider by-
stander privacy, allowing them to opt out with visual (e.g.,
[36]) or digital markers (e.g., [7, 16]). TagMeNot [8] proposes
QR codes for opting out of photo tagging. These designs rely
on compliant recording devices or vendors; other systems
aim to prevent recording by uncooperative devices, e.g., by
ﬂashing directed light at cameras [32]. Recent work studied
bystander reactions to augmented reality devices and sur-

veyed design axes for privacy-mediation approaches [11].
Others have considered the privacy of device users.
In-
deed, Starner considered it a primary challenge for wearable
computing [38]. Though wearable devices can improve secu-
rity (e.g., with location-based or device-based access control,
as in Grey [5]), data collected or sent by the device can re-
veal sensitive information. Such concerns motivate privacy-
preserving location-based access control (e.g., [4]). Here, we
assume that the device and system are trustworthy.
Others have also restricted applications’ access to percep-
tual data. Darkly [19] integrates privacy protection into
OpenCV, and the “recognizer” abstraction [18] helps limit
applications’ access to objects in a sensor feed; we build on
these ideas. PlaceAvoider [39] identiﬁes images captured in
sensitive locations and withholds them from applications.
PiBox [22] restricts applications from secretly leaking pri-
vate data, but provides weak guarantees when users explic-
itly share it. Our approach helps users avoid accidentally
sharing sensitive content with untrusted applications.
9. CONCLUSION
Continuous sensing applications on platforms like smart-
phones, Google Glass, and XBox Kinect raise serious access
control challenges not solved by current techniques. We in-
troduced world-driven access control, by which real-world
objects specify per-application privacy policies. This ap-
proach aims to enable permission management at the gran-
ularity of objects rather than complete sensor streams, and
without explicitly involving the user. A trusted platform
detects these policies in the environment and automatically
adjusts each application’s “view” accordingly.
We built an end-to-end world-driven access control pro-
totype, surfacing key challenges. We introduced passports
to address policy authenticity and to allow our system to
be dynamically extended. We mitigated detection inaccura-
cies by combining multiple policy communication techniques
and introducing memory into policies. Finally, we explored
the tradeoﬀs between policy accuracy and performance, and
between broadcast policies and privacy.
Our prototype enforces many policies, each expressed with
modest developer eﬀort, with reasonable accuracy even with
today’s technologies and oﬀ-the-shelf algorithms. Our expe-
riences suggest that world-driven access control can relieve
the user’s permission management burden while preserving
functionality and protecting privacy. Beyond exploring a
new design point for access control in continuous sensing,
this work represents a step toward integrating physical ob-
jects into a virtual world ; we believe our explorations lay the
groundwork for future work in this space.

APPENDIX
A. REAL-WORLD POLICIES
We summarize a sample set of real-world locations with
sensor privacy policies (Figure 10) that would beneﬁt from
world-driven access control. These scenarios motivate the
incentive of establishments to install world-driven policies.
The ﬁrst two settings are bars that request patrons refrain
from taking recordings of others without permission. For
example, the 5 Point Cafe recently banned Google’s Glass
device due to privacy concerns [41] and other Glass bans
have followed [15]. Similarly, the “local gym” and “Goodwill”
settings both prohibit recording devices near dressing rooms.
All of these places could specify an explicit “no pictures”
policy for a world-driven access control device.
The next four settings are conventions that set explicit
policies around photography [3], generally requiring asking
before taking a photo or prohibiting recording in certain
times or locations (e.g., during a conference session). One
policy is more ﬁne-grained, based on explicit communication
from attendees using colored lanyards (where a red lanyard
means “no photos,” a yellow lanyard means “ask ﬁrst,” and a
green lanyard means “photos OK”). These colors could serve
as the foundation for a world-driven access control policy. As
suggested in prior work, such individual policies could also
be communicated using a marker on a shirt [36] or via a
communication from the bystander’s phone (e.g., [7, 16]).
Finally, Google’s Street View product, which is powered
by cars that regularly drive through the world and capture
panoramic views, has raised signiﬁcant privacy concerns.
Switzerland only recently allowed Google to collect Street
View data, but it required Google to blur sensitive areas
and refrain from taking pictures across fences and garden
hedges [29]. These policies could also be enforced by world-
driven access control, based on the locations of sensitive ar-
eas or presence of fences.
While today’s real-world policies tend to focus on the pri-
vacy of bystanders, always-on devices like Google Glass will
also raise privacy concerns for users. For example, our ﬁnd-
ings in a user survey (not described here) suggest that many
users do not wish to be recorded by their own wearable de-
vices in sensitive locations (e.g., at home, in the bathroom).
