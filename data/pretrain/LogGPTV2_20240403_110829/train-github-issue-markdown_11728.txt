By default Bootstrap Modal caches data loaded from remote resource. In my case
I have different links to show different content in the same modal instance.

As you can see - I have two different addresses. But in Modal I see only first
loaded page. All other clicks show me the same "old" content.
I solve this problem in this way:
        // no cache data loaded to modal popup (by default it's cached)
        $('body').on('hidden.bs.modal', '.modal', function (event) {
            $(this).removeData('bs.modal');
        });
I think that it will be better if you will add option `cache` _(true/false)_
to Modal to control caching. It's not big change, but very helpful.
