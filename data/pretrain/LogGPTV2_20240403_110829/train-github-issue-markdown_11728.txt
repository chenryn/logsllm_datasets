By default, Bootstrap Modal caches the data loaded from a remote resource. In my specific use case, I have multiple links that should display different content within the same modal instance. For example:

- Write Review
- Order

Each of these links points to a different URL. However, once the first link is clicked and the content is loaded into the modal, all subsequent clicks on other links continue to show the initially loaded content, rather than the new content.

To address this issue, I implemented the following solution:

```javascript
// Prevent caching of data loaded into the modal (by default, it is cached)
$('body').on('hidden.bs.modal', '.modal', function (event) {
    $(this).removeData('bs.modal');
});
```

This code ensures that the modal's data is removed when the modal is hidden, thus preventing the caching of the previously loaded content.

I believe it would be beneficial to add an `cache` option (with values `true` or `false`) to the Modal component. This would allow developers to control whether the content is cached or not. While this is a small change, it would be very helpful for scenarios like mine.
