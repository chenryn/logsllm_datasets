User: I have a feeling the answer is simple and documented, but I'm absolutely missing it:
Is there a way, using Python and webapp through Google App Engine, to pass the id field of a record to the template? I'm fairly new to the app engine, and yes, I have searched all around the Google Documentation to find this.
Assistant: I can reference it through record.key().id(). I just found this RIGHT AFTER I posted this question (as luck would have it). Sorry for wasting anybody's time.
