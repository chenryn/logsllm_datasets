User: I went to tools, plugins. Then chose to install the three python items that show up. After installation. I choose the restart netbeans option. But instead of restarting, netbeans just closed. And now it is not opening. Any ideas how to fix this? I normally develop Java on my netbeans 7 install.
I am using a mac osx
I see there are no takers, so let me ask this: Is there a way to revert to before the new plugin install?
Assistant: I was having a problem with Netbeans 7 not starting. Netbeans had first errored out with no error message. Then it wouldn't start or give me an error. I looked in the .netbeans directory in my user directory, and found and attempted to delete the 'lock' file in that directory. When I first tried to delete it, it said it was in use. So with task manager, I had to go to processes tab and find netbeans. I killed that task, then was able to delete 'lock'. Then netbeans started.
