It seems like you encountered an issue with NetBeans 7 after attempting to install some Python plugins. Hereâ€™s a more structured and detailed version of your problem and the solution you found:

**Problem:**
I attempted to install three Python-related plugins in NetBeans 7 via the "Tools" > "Plugins" menu. After completing the installation, I chose the option to restart NetBeans. However, instead of restarting, NetBeans closed and now it won't open at all. I usually use NetBeans for Java development on my Mac OS X.

**Question:**
1. Is there a way to revert to the state before the new plugin installation?
2. How can I resolve this issue and get NetBeans to start again?

**Solution:**
I managed to resolve the issue by following these steps:

1. **Identify the Problem:**
   - NetBeans 7 was not starting and did not provide any error messages.
   - It had initially errored out without any specific error message.

2. **Locate the Lock File:**
   - I navigated to the `.netbeans` directory in my user directory.
   - Inside the `.netbeans` directory, I found a file named `lock`.

3. **Delete the Lock File:**
   - When I first tried to delete the `lock` file, I received a message saying it was in use.
   - To resolve this, I opened the Task Manager (or Activity Monitor on Mac OS X) and went to the Processes tab.
   - I located and terminated the NetBeans process.

4. **Remove the Lock File:**
   - After terminating the NetBeans process, I was able to delete the `lock` file.

5. **Restart NetBeans:**
   - Once the `lock` file was deleted, I was able to start NetBeans successfully.

By following these steps, I was able to get NetBeans 7 to start again without reverting to a previous state.
