### Table V Analysis
In the final column of Table V, it is evident that the combined deposit in our example cases is lower compared to payment hubs.

### Design Challenges for Payment Hubs
Designing a payment hub where the operator's collateral is proportional only to active customers (and not all registered customers) presents a significant challenge. This is because the deposited collateral cannot be freely reallocated from one customer to another [30]. Some commit-chain variants [31] manage to reduce operator collaterals compared to traditional hubs, but these systems fail to provide both secure and fast payments. Other commit-chain variants [31] enable fast and safe payments but require continuous online monitoring, which is impractical for many retail customers. Therefore, we do not consider commit chains as directly comparable and exclude them from this discussion (see Section VIII for more details).

### Operational Costs
The amount of funds locked by system operators allows us to estimate the operational costs of the Snappy system relative to other solutions. For instance, in our retail case, each merchant running a statekeeper must deposit $150,000. Assuming a 7% annual return on investment, the opportunity cost of the locked-in money is $10,500 per year. When combined with operational expenses such as electricity and internet, this gives the total operational cost of Snappy. We consider this an acceptable cost for large retailers. In contrast, a payment hub operator would need to deposit $250 million, resulting in an annual cost of $17.5 million plus operational expenses, which is three orders of magnitude higher.

## VII. Discussion

### A. Governance
Snappy is designed with a majority-based governance model, allowing any majority of statekeeping nodes to decide to ostracize merchants or statekeepers who are no longer deemed fit to participate. For example, a majority can stop processing requests from a merchant who has equivocated (signed conflicting transactions). If more complex governance processes are required (e.g., first-past-the-post voting), the Arbiter’s smart contract can be extended accordingly.

### B. Censorship Mitigation
A direct implication of Snappy’s governance model is that a majority of statekeeping nodes could discriminate against a specific victim merchant by not responding to its payment approval requests or by delaying the processing of its requests. This censorship can be addressed in two ways:

1. **Technical Approach**: Discrimination against a specific victim merchant can be prevented by concealing the recipient merchant’s identity during the payment approval process. This can be achieved by replacing fields that could be used to identify the merchant (e.g., "recipient", "amount") with a cryptographic commitment. Commitments hide the merchant’s identity from other merchants (statekeepers) during payment approval but allow the merchant to claim any lost funds from the Arbiter later by opening the commitment. Additionally, if IP address fingerprinting is a concern, merchants can send their approval requests through an anonymity network (e.g., Tor, which increases latency by ~500ms [46]) or through the customer’s device to eliminate direct communication between competing merchants.

2. **Non-Technical Approach**: In cases where merchant identities are known and there is a mutually trusted authority (e.g., a merchants’ association), the victim merchant can file a complaint against consistently misbehaving merchants. In cases of widespread attacks, the victim merchant can reclaim their collaterals in full, deregister from the consortium, and join another consortium.

### C. Transaction Privacy
For on-chain transaction privacy, Snappy inherits the privacy level of the underlying blockchain. For example, Ethereum provides transaction pseudonymity, so every transaction processed with Snappy is pseudonymous once recorded on the chain. During payment approval, the identity of the recipient merchant can be concealed from all statekeepers using cryptographic commitments, as explained above (see Section VII-B). However, the pseudonym of the customer remains visible to the statekeepers.

Well-known privacy-enhancing practices like multiple addresses and mixing services [47], [48] can be used to enhance customer privacy. For example, a Snappy customer could generate several Ethereum accounts, register them with the Arbiter, and use each one for a single payment. Once all accounts have been used, the customer can de-register them, generate a new set of accounts, move the money to the new accounts through a mixing service, and register new accounts. The main drawback of this approach is that the user needs to lock in more collateral and pay the registration fee multiple times.

In the future, blockchains with privacy-preserving features like ZCash [49] combined with private smart contracts based on Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge proofs (NIZKs) could address the on-chain confidentiality problem more efficiently and protect the privacy of both users and merchants. However, realizing such a secure, efficient, and private smart contract language while achieving decent expressiveness remains an open research problem [50].

### D. Limitations
The main drawbacks of using Snappy are as follows:
1. Customers and merchants need to place small collaterals, keeping a percentage of their funds locked-in for extended periods.
2. Snappy can scale up to a moderate number of statekeeping merchants but cannot support hundreds of thousands or millions of statekeeping nodes. In such cases, alternative deployment options can be considered (see Appendix B).
3. Snappy does not move payment transactions off the chain, so customers still need to cover the transaction processing fees charged by the blockchain’s miners.

## VIII. Related Work

### Payment Channels
Payment channels enable two parties to send funds to each other off the chain, adding only an opening and a closing transaction on the chain [8], [9], [12]. With the opening transaction, the two parties lock funds in the channel, which are then used throughout the channel's lifetime. In cases where the two parties send approximately the same amount of funds to each other over time, a payment channel can enable almost indefinite near-instant payments. However, in a retail setting, customers unilaterally send funds to merchants. Moreover, customers transact with several merchants, requiring them to maintain multiple channels and keep sufficient funds in each.

### Payment Networks
Payment networks utilize the payment channels established between pairs of users to build longer paths [10], [11]. While this is a straightforward idea, finding reliable routes is not trivial [28]. The state of individual channels changes arbitrarily over time, causing the capacity of the graph's edges to fluctuate. Additionally, the unilateral nature of retail payments (customer → merchant) quickly depletes the available funds in individual channels, preventing them from serving as intermediaries to route payments by other customers [29]. Miller et al. [8] showed that even under favorable conditions (2,000 nodes, customers replenish their accounts every 10 seconds, maximum expenditure of $20, no attacks), approximately 2% of the payments will fail. At peak hours, the network's ability to route payments from customers to merchants is expected to degrade further. Rebalancing methods [51] have only a limited effect, primarily because credit cycles are rarely formed in real life [8].

### Payment Hubs
Payment hubs introduce a single central point connecting all customers to all merchants, eliminating the need to find routing paths and theoretically requiring a smaller total amount of locked funds for customers [30]. However, this approach has two main drawbacks:
1. It introduces a single point of failure for payment availability.
2. The hub operator needs to deposit a very large amount of funds to match the total expenditure of all customers [12], [13], leading to significant service fees. For example, a hub serving n = 1M customers with a total of $250M in their channels must also lock-in that amount in channels with merchants to accommodate payments, especially during peak hours. Hub operators would charge substantial fees to cover the opportunity cost of the large locked-in funds.

### Commit-Chains
Commit-chains are parallel (and not yet peer-reviewed) work [30], [31], [52] that may either reduce or eliminate operator collaterals compared to payment hubs. The main idea of commit-chains is to maintain a second-layer ledger and make periodic commitments (called checkpoints) of its state transitions to the main chain. One proposed variant [31] does not require the central operator to place any collateral but does not enable fast and safe payments, as users must wait for the next checkpoint, which may take hours or days. Another variant [31] allows safe and fast payments but requires users to monitor the blockchain (hourly or daily) and dispute checkpoints if their balance is inaccurately represented. This monitoring assumption is problematic, especially in use cases like retail with a large number of customers using various client devices. Although the operator’s collateral is slightly lower than that of payment hubs, it still remains very large (e.g., $200M in our “large retailers” use case) [14]. Snappy enables fast and safe payments with smaller merchant collaterals for customers who remain mostly offline.

### Side-Chains
Side-chains use a permissioned set of validators to track pending transactions, typically using a BFT consensus protocol [16], [17]. Such solutions significantly change the trust assumptions of permissionless blockchains, as BFT consensus requires that 2/3 of the validators must be trusted. Side-chains also require multiple rounds of communication and have high message complexity.

### Probabilistic Payments
Probabilistic payments such as MICROPAY1/2/3 can, in certain scenarios, enable efficient and fast payment approval [53], [54]. However, such solutions require that the service provided is continuous and granular so that the payments' probabilistic variance becomes negligible. In retail payments, this provides no guarantee that the merchant will be paid the correct amount.

## IX. Conclusion
In this paper, we presented Snappy, a novel system that enables merchants to safely accept fast on-chain payments on slow blockchains. We tailored our solution for settings such as retail payments, where currently popular cryptocurrencies are not usable due to their high latency and where previous solutions such as payment channels, networks, and hubs have significant limitations that prevent their adoption in practice.
