ABSTRACT
We present a quantitative lower bound on the number of
vulnerable embedded device on a global scale. Over the
past year, we have systematically scanned large portions of
the internet to monitor the presence of trivially vulnerable
embedded devices. At the time of writing, we have iden-
tiﬁed over 540,000 publicly accessible embedded devices
conﬁgured with factory default root passwords. This consti-
tutes over 13% of all discovered embedded devices.These de-
vices range from enterprise equipment such as ﬁrewalls and
routers to consumer appliances such as VoIP adapters, cable
and IPTV boxes to oﬃce equipment such as network print-
ers and video conferencing units. Vulnerable devices were
detected in 144 countries, across 17,427 unique private
enterprise, ISP, government, educational, satellite provider
as well as residential network environments. Preliminary re-
sults from our longitudinal study tracking over 102,000 vul-
nerable devices revealed that over 96% of such accessible
devices remain vulnerable after a 4-month period. We be-
lieve the data presented in this paper provides a conservative
lower bound on the actual population of vulnerable devices
in the wild. By combining the observed vulnerability dis-
tributions and its potential root causes, we propose a set of
mitigation strategies and hypothesize about its quantitative
impact on reducing the global vulnerable embedded device
population. Employing our strategy, we have partnered with
Team Cymru to engage key organizations capable of signiﬁ-
cantly reducing the number of trivially vulnerable embedded
devices currently on the internet. As an ongoing longitudi-
nal study, we plan to gather data continuously over the next
year in order to quantify the eﬀectiveness of community’s
cumulative eﬀort to mitigate this pervasive threat.

cams, VoIP appliances, print servers and video conferencing
units reside on the same networks as our personal comput-
ers and enterprise servers and together form our world-wide
communication infrastructure. Widely deployed and often
misconﬁgured, embedded network devices constitute highly
attractive targets for exploitation.
Although common wisdom enforces the suspicion that em-
bedded devices tend to be less secure then general purpose
computers and often trivial to exploit, evidence of such in-
securities is mostly anecdotal. To fully appreciate the scope
and scale of the embedded threat, we must move beyond
analysis of individual embedded devices and their vulner-
abilities. In order to formulate realistic and eﬀective mit-
igation strategies against current and next generation em-
bedded device exploitation, we ﬁrst pose and answer several
fundamental questions:
– How have embedded devices been exploited in the past?
How feasible is large scale exploitation of embedded
devices? (Section 2)
– How can we quantitatively measure the level of em-
bedded device insecurity on a global scale? (Section
3)
– How can compromised embedded devices be used to
beneﬁt malicious attackers? (Section 4)
– How many vulnerable embedded devices are there in
the world? What are they? Where are they? (Section
5)
– What are the most eﬃcient methods of securing vul-
nerable embedded devices? (Section 6)
The purpose of our project is to quantify and trend the
level of insecurity of embedded devices currently in the wild.
To this end, we ﬁrst establish an observed lower bound on
the number of trivially vulnerable embedded devices on the
internet. We do this by assuming the role of the least so-
phisticated malicious attacker (See Section 3.1), who only
tries to log into publicly reachable embedded devices us-
ing well known default root credentials. Section 3 de-
scribes the default credential scanner we developed using
standard tools such as nmap, which positively identiﬁed
over 540,000 wide open embedded devices.
Vulnerable devices were detected in 144 countries, in
enterprise, ISP, government, educational, satellite provider
as well as residential network environments1. We discov-

ered vulnerable devices across a diverse spectrum of prod-
uct types, including consumer appliances, home networking
devices, oﬃce appliances, enterprise and carrier network-
ing equipment, data-center power management devices, net-
work security appliances, server lights-out-management con-
trollers, IP camera surveillance systems, VoIP devices, video
conferencing appliances as well as ISP issued modems and
set-top boxes. Section 5 presents detailed analysis of the
data collected by our default credential scanner.

vices in IPv4 Space. Total Number of Vulnerable

While the observed quantity and distribution of embedded
devices conﬁgured with default root passwords demonstrate
a global, pervasive phenomenon, we believe the data pre-
sented in this paper represent a conservative lower bound
on the actual population of vulnerable devices in the wild.
Evidence suggests that this lower bound can be raised sig-
niﬁcantly by slightly escalating the level of sophistication of
our assumed attacker [11].
1.1 Contributions
We present the ﬁrst quantitative measurement of embed-
ded device insecurity on a global scale, along with prelimi-
nary results from an ongoing longitudinal study of the same
subject. By assuming the role of the least sophisticated
attacker (see Section 3.1), we present an observed lower
bound on the distribution of trivially exploitable network
embedded devices over functional (Section 5.1), spatial (Sec-
tion 5.2), organizational (Section 5.3) and temporal (Section
5.5) domains.
The embedded device default credential scanner created
for this experiment is designed to identify eﬃciently and
safely the vulnerable embedded devices on the network. It
does this by testing whether one can remotely login into a
device using well known default root credentials. The veri-
ﬁcation process is designed to use minimal resources on the
target embedded device. The scanner currently supports
73 unique embedded device types including consumer appli-
ances, home networking devices, oﬃce appliances, enterprise
and carrier networking equipment, data-center power man-
agement devices, network security appliances, server lights-
out-management controllers, IP camera surveillance systems,
VoIP devices, video conferencing appliances as well as ISP
issued modems and set-top boxes.
While the embedded security threat has been generally
known for some time, the data presented in this paper pro-
vides a real-world quantitative assessment of the scale and
scope of the embedded threat on a global level. Analy-
sis of our results yields several interesting features within
the observed vulnerability distributions. The features pre-
sented in Section 5 presents insights into the root causes of
the existence of vulnerable embedded devices. By combin-
ing the observed vulnerability distributions and its potential
root causes, we formulate a set of mitigation strategies and
hypothesize about its quantitative impact on reducing the
global vulnerable device population.
Many forces will undoubtably change the observable lower
bound of embedded device insecurity as time goes on. For
example, the out-of-the-box security of new embedded prod-
ucts may change. Network operators controlling large homo-
geneous sets of devices may improve their security, as may
small and medium size organizations like private enterprises
and educational organizations. The level of malicious ex-
ploitation will also indirectly contribute to the overall eﬀort
dedicated to improving embedded device security. Lastly,
it is our hope that the data and mitigation strategies re-
ported in this paper will generate more awareness of this
pervasive threat. In order to quantify the scope of the em-
bedded device insecurity threat over time and detect such
forces at work, we plan to continue our scanning activities
to conduct an ongoing longitudinal study over the next year.
Section 5.5 discusses the preliminary results of our longitu-
dinal study over the past four months.
1.2 Outline
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Sec-
tion 2 surveys recent developments related to embedded de-
vice insecurity in white-hat and black-hat communities as
well as popular literature. Section 3 describes our method-
ology with emphasis on the steps taken to ensure a safe and
ethical experimental protocol. Section 4 describes a variety
of novel malicious uses of the vulnerable devices discovered
by our scanner. Section 5 presents the analysis of data gath-
ered from our latest global scan as well as preliminary results
from our ongoing longitudinal study. Section 6 presents a
set of remediation strategies, along with an quantitative es-
timates of its potential eﬀect with respect to the global vul-
nerable device population. We conclude in Section 7 with a
summary of our contributions.

Evidence of embedded device insecurity and exploitation
has been presented in both white-hat and black-hat venues
for quite some time. The creation and propagation charac-
teristics of hypothetical malnets exploiting vulnerable wire-
less routers have been described by several researchers [10,
19]. For example, Traynor et al. showed that an adversary
can potentially compromise over 24,000 routers in Manhat-
tan in less than 2 hours [19]. The data from our scan in-
dicates that trivially exploitable embedded devices exist in
suﬃcient quantity and concentration for such hypothetical
attacks to be feasible. Our data also corroborates that phish-
ing attacks using compromised consumer electronics such as
home routers [20] can be carried out on a large scale by
technically unsophisticated attackers.
Existing evidence clearly reenforces the common wisdom
that embedded devices are generally less secure then general
purpose computers and are often trivial to exploit. However,
the available literature tends to focus on speciﬁc vulnerabil-
ities or vulnerable devices.
For example, a recent Wired.com article [9] announced
a vulnerability found on the administrative interface of the
SMC8014 series cable modem, potentially aﬀecting 65,000
Time Warner customers. Numerous research projects [18,
11] targeting speciﬁc device types have demonstrated that
large numbers of vulnerabilities within ubiquitous embed-
ded device types. According to Bojinov et al., an audit of
common embedded administrative interfaces from 16 major
manufacturers yielded signiﬁcant vulnerabilities from all of
the 21 devices considered [11].
The evolution of embedded device exploitation tools and
techniques demonstrate an accelerating maturation of ma-
licious attacks against embedded devices. While proof of
concept Cisco IOS exploits and shellcode have been publicly
available since 2003 [13, 16], recent evidence suggests that
attackers are scanning for and exploiting consumer routers
to build modest size bot-nets, mainly for DDOS purposes.
The appearance of tutorials [5] and simple to use tools to
ﬁnd and control speciﬁc consumer routers indicate that em-
bedded device exploitation techniques are beginning to dif-
fuse out of research circles, and into the general black-hat
community.
To the best of our knowledge, the ﬁrst consumer router
botnet, psyb0t, was reported by Dronebl.org in 2008 [6].
While no detailed analysis of the bot was published, we
do know that it primarily targeted mipsel OpenWRT and
DD-WRT devices using default passwords. It is suspected
that the psyb0t botnet observed in 2008 was a proof of con-
cept test of the technology [7], as the botnet was quickly
shutdown by its operators following Dronebl.org’s public an-
nouncement of its existence.
The current generation of embedded device malcode may
be related to existing unix tools like Kaiten.c [1]. A sur-
vey of black hat literature circa 2008 shows at least one
document describing the process of compromising similar
consumer routers using password guessing and existing unix
IRC bots [5]. This may help to explain why the majority
of victim embedded devices exploited thus far have been
unix-based consumer routers. For example, psyb0t targeted
only home routers and heavily leveraged the unix-like oper-
ating environment found on its victim devices. Speciﬁcally,
psyb0t used commands like wget and chmod to download
its payload onto victim devices and used iptables to block
all administrative interfaces to protect the device from other
attackers.
2.1 Next Generation Embedded Malcode
Existing embedded device malcode such as psyb0t de-
pend heavily on its victim devices’ similarity to traditional
unix systems. While development of such malcode is rela-
tively straightforward, it constrains the vulnerable popula-
tion to low-end consumer appliances running unix-like oper-
ating systems. For example, enterprise networking devices
like Cisco routers and switches run on proprietary operat-
ing systems like IOS, which do not resemble traditional unix
architecture. However, recent advancements in exploitation
and root-kitting techniques for proprietary operating sys-
tems like Cisco IOS [17, 14] could allow attackers to com-
promise high-end enterprise devices like backbone routers
and ﬁrewalls. It is highly likely that the next generation of
embedded device malcode will have greater ability to com-
promise heterogeneous device types, stealthier and more so-
phisticated command and control channels, as well as other
malicious capabilities aside from DDOS.
Furthermore, as data presented in Section 5 suggest, the
current population of trivially vulnerable embedded devices
is quite high. Therefore, the next generation of malcode ca-
pable of compromising heterogeneous device types will easily
be able to infect signiﬁcantly more devices then psyb0t and
kaiten.c in their current state.
3. EXPERIMENTAL METHODOLOGY
The default credential scanner is designed to quickly sweep
large portions of the internet. Each scan takes approxi-
mately four weeks and involves two or three sweeps of the
entire monitored IP space (Section 3.4 discusses how the
monitored IP ranges are selected.)
Multiple sweeps across the same IP space is desirable for
two reasons. First, embedded devices on residential net-
works have unpredictable availability. Therefore, multiple
sweeps increase the scanner’s probability of observing a vul-
nerable device when it is connected to the network. Second,
multiple sweeps across the same address space over months
and years allow us to conduct a longitudinal study on the
vulnerability rates of embedded devices around the world.
In Section 5, we present the results of our latest scan, con-
taining over 540,000 observed vulnerable devices, as well as
analysis of preliminary data gathered by tracking approxi-
mately 102,000 vulnerable embedded devices over a span of
four months in Section 5. This is an ongoing study, and we
plan to publish the results of a detailed longitudinal study
over the next year when the data becomes available.
3.1 Threat Model
For the sake of establishing a lower bound on the state of
embedded device insecurity in the wild, we assume the role
of the least sophisticated malicious attacker. The attacker
has unrestricted access to the internet but is unable to ex-
ploit any vulnerabilities found on any devices. Instead, the
attacker has access to the network scanner nmap and a list
of well known factory default root credentials for popular
network embedded devices.
For the remainder of the paper, we deﬁne a vulnerable
device as any device that is reachable on the internet and
allows the attacker to gain root privileges by using factory
default credentials.
