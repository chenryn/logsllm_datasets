Figure 3: The cost of error in which a miss is N times the
cost of a false alarm. The point of equal cost of using ei-
ther truncated or enriched data is .3155, where the two lines
cross.
Figure 3 shows the cost of error for cases in which a miss
is N times the cost of a false alarm, with N shown along the
x-axis. When N is 1, the cost of a miss is the same as the
cost of a false alarm. When N is .3155, the cost of using
either truncated or enriched data is the same. As the relative
cost of a miss to a false alarm goes up, the cost of using
truncated data becomes much higher than the cost of using
enriched data, as shown by the diverging lines in the graph.
For the masquerade detection problem, it seems reason-
able to estimate costs in this way, because a missed mas-
querader may cause damage worth far more than the mere
cost of investigating a false alarm. Of course this depends
on how many false alarms occur for every missed masquer-
ader, but given equal base rates we can see that once the cost
of a miss rises to being more than about one third (.3155)
the cost of a false alarm, then using enriched command-line
data entails an enormous advantage which escalates as the
cost differential grows.
6.2 Transition table
While ROC curves and cost functions can portray the
gross differences between using truncated and enriched
data, examining the transitions of events from one kind of
data to another can also be informative. The objective of
using enriched data was to facilitate as many transitions as
possible, from misses in the truncated data to hits in the en-
riched data. How many transitions of various types were
there, and what were the interesting cases? Table 5 summa-
rizes the total transitions from truncated to enriched data.
For example, of all the masquerade injections that were
missed in the truncated data, 67.43% of them transitioned to
hits in the enriched data. Of all the injections that were cor-
rectly detected in the truncated data, only 11.84% of them
transitioned to misses in the enriched data, for a net gain of
55.59%. Of the hits in the truncated data, 88.16% of them
remained hits in the enriched data.

Table 5: Overall transitions from truncated to enriched data.
A complete presentation of the transitions between the
truncated and enriched conditions, resulting from all 30 in-
jections into each of 50 victims, is shown in Table 6. These
were run in two conditions, truncated and enriched, with
the anticipation that missed detections in the truncated con-
dition would transition to correct detections in the enriched
condition. For example, column 1 and row 1 of the table
shows the effect of masquerader 1 on victim (user) 1. The
symbol * indicates that this injection was correctly detected
in both the truncated and enriched conditions. Column 1
row 7 (+) shows a case in which a miss in the truncated con-
dition transitioned to a hit in the enriched condition, which
is exactly what was hoped for. Of course there were also a
few cases, such as for masquerader 7, victim 1, in which the
enriched data effected a reduction in correct detections, but
overall these were in the minority.
6.3 Pathologies showing effects of enriched data
Close examination of Table 6 shows the details of classi-
ﬁcations that improved from a miss to a hit or deteriorated
from a hit to a miss upon moving from truncated data to
enriched data. As seen in the table, the changes indicated
in the columns corresponding to masqueraders 2, 16 and 26
stand out, because they show the largest numbers of miss-
to-hit transitions. Detection of these injections improved
more than two-fold with the introduction of enriched data;
