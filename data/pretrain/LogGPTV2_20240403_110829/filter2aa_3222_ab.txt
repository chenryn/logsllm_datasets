FAIL #5 - HIDING IN THE 
CLOUD
Opposing attorney handed us CD with an Outlook.PST
FAIL #5 - HIDING IN THE 
CLOUD
First thing we do is search for deleted emails
FAIL #5 - HIDING IN THE 
CLOUD
10s of thousands of deleted emails
Changes the direction of the case 180 degrees
#WINNING
Who deleted the emails...????
What have we learned #5 
IE history is hard to wipe
Found a new artifact (filesanywhere) 
.js files are capable of love too!
Uploading files still leaves traces
Attorneys shouldn’t mess with evidence! (Especially if 
they don’t understand how PSTs work)

access

Windows environment
Thousands of PCs in multiple sites around the world

before
Analyzed machine that came after
Started noticing a pattern...
FAIL #6 - The RDP Bounce
We still wanted to know WHY. What was the target?
Followed the chain forward
Reached a high-profile machine
Target identified. Steal highly-confidential 
documents
FAIL #6 - The RDP Bounce
Focused analysis on target machine
What did they do?
What did they take?
Within minutes the attacker was identified
How?

FAIL #6 - The RDP Bounce
By default, RDP maps your printer when 
connecting to a remote machine
This allows you to “print” from their 
machine to your printer
Attacker forgot to turn this off
What have we learned... #6

events can give insight into user actions
