Google has recently released PEGASUS, a new model for text summarization:
https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/06/pegasus-state-of-art-model-for.html. I think
It would be interesting to have it included in Transformers library. The code
and checkpoints are here: https://github.com/google-research/pegasus. This
model seems to accomplish human-like summarization.
