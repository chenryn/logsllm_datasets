So you want to be an Incident Commander (IC)? You've come to the right place! You don't need to be a senior team member to become an IC, anyone can do it providing you have the requisite knowledge (yes, even an intern!)
## Purpose
If you could boil down the purpose of an Incident Commander to one sentence, it would be:
> Keep the incident moving towards resolution.
The Incident Commander is the decision maker during a major incident; Delegating tasks and listening to input from subject matter experts in order to bring the incident to resolution. They become the highest ranking individual on any major incident call, regardless of their day-to-day rank. Their decisions made as commander are final.
Your job as an Incident Commander is to listen to the call and to watch the incident Slack room in order to provide clear coordination, recruiting others to gather context/details. **You should not be performing any actions or remediations, checking graphs, or investigating logs.** Those tasks should be delegated.
An IC should also be considering next steps and backup plans at every opportunity, in an effort to avoid getting stuck without any clear options to proceed and to keep things moving towards resolution.
## Prerequisites
Before you can be an Incident Commander, it is expected that you meet the following criteria. Don't worry if you don't meet them all yet, you can still continue with training!
* Excellent verbal and written **communication skills**.
* Has **high-level knowledge** of how the different PagerDuty services interact with each other.
* Ability to size up a situation, **assess the effectiveness** of various tactics/strategies, and **make rapid decisions** on appropriate courses of action.
* Has flexibility, and is able to **listen to expert feedback**, modifying plans on-the-fly as necessary.
* Has been **involved in at least two major incident responses**, either as a spectator, or as an active participant.
* Has gravitas, **takes command**, and is **willing to kick people off a call** to remove distractions, even if it's the CEO.
!!!tip "Deep technical knowledge not required!"
    [Incident Commanders do not require deep technical knowledge of our systems](../resources/anti_patterns.md#requiring-incident-commanders-to-have-deep-technical-knowledge). Your job as Incident Commander is to coordinate the response, not make technical changes. Don’t think you can’t be an Incident Commander just because you’re not in the engineering department!
## Responsibilities
Read up on our [Different Roles for Incidents](../before/different_roles.md) to see what is expected from an Incident Commander, as well as what we expect from the other roles you'll be interacting with.
## Training Process
The process is fairly loose for now. Here's a list of things you can do to train though,
* Read the rest of this page, particularly the sections below.
* Participate in [Failure Friday](https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/failure-friday-at-pagerduty/) (FF).
    * Shadow a FF to see how it's run.
    * Be the Scribe for multiple FF's.
    * Be the Incident Commander for multiple FF's.
* Play a game of "[Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes](https://www.keeptalkinggame.com/)" with other people in the office.
    * For a more realistic experience, play it with someone in a different office over Hangouts.
* Shadow a current Incident Commander for at least a full week shift.
    * Get alerted when they do, join in on the same calls.
    * Sit in on an active incident call, follow along with the chat, and follow along with what the Incident Commander is doing.
    * **Do not actively participate in the call, keep your questions until the end.**
* Reverse shadow a current Incident Commander for at least a full week shift.
    * You should be the one to respond to incidents, and you will take point on calls; however, the current IC will be there to take over should you not know how to proceed.
## Graduation
What's the difference between an IC in training and an IC? (This isn't a set up to a joke). Simple, an IC puts themselves on the schedules.
Also, don't forget to announce yourself in the IC Slack channel, and get yourself added to our IC mailing list.
## Handling Incidents
Every incident is different (we're hopefully not repeating the same issue multiple times!), but there's a common process you can apply to each one. The language used in each step is discussed in more detail in the "Procedures and Lingo" section below.
![Handling Incidents](../assets/img/misc/handling_incidents.png)
### Size-Up
_Sizing-up involves getting an idea of what's going on, and how much impact it's having. This is an information gathering step that will allow you to make good decisions later._
1. **Identify the symptoms. _- Ask "What's wrong?"_**
    * Identify what the symptoms are and ask your experts to provide this information.
    * Gather as much information as you can, as quickly as you can (remember the incident is still happening while you're doing this).
1. **Identify scope of incident. _- Ask "Is this affecting multiple services?"_**
    * Identify how big the issue is and whether it's escalating/flapping/static.
    * Get the facts, the possibilities of what can happen, and the probability of those things happening.
### Stabilize
_Next step is to stabilize the incident. We need to determine what we can do to fix it, and then execute those actions._
1. **Identify possible actions. _- Ask "What actions can we take? How risky are they?"_**
    * Identify any actions you can take to alleviate the issue. Ask your experts what they want to do.
    * Identify the risks associated with each of those actions.
1. **Make a decision. _- Say "We're proceeding with..."_**
    * Decide which action to take based on the information you have available.
    * Making the "wrong" decision is better than making no decision. If you have nothing but bad options, pick one and proceed.
1. **Gain consensus. _- Ask "Are there any strong objections?"_**
    * Gather support for the plan (See "Polling During a Decision" below).
    * Listen for objections.
    * Be prepared to adjust your plan if new information is presented.
1. **Assign task. _- Say "A, please perform B, I'll come back to you in X minutes. Understood?"_**
    * Delegate remediation actions to your SME's.
    * Tasks should be assigned to an individual and be time-boxed.
    * Get acknowledgement that the task was understood and is being executed.
### Update
_While remediation steps are being carried out, it's important to provide status updates, not just to responders, but other stakeholders within the organization._
1. **Provide regular updates. _- Say "Here's a status update: ..."_**
    * Maintain a cadence, and provide regular updates to everyone on the call.
    * What's happening, what are we doing about it, etc.
    * Keep updates short and factual.
### Verify
_Once remediation actions have been performed, we need to verify that they have been successful or not, and proceed with a backup plan if not._
1. **Follow-up on task completion. _- Ask "Have you finished?"_**
    * Ask for the status of task completion from the tasks you assigned out.
    * If responders need more time, give them more time.
    * If problems persist, begin again from the size-up step.
## Deputy
The Deputy for an incident is generally the backup Incident Commander. However, as an Incident Commander, you may appoint one or more Deputies. Note that Deputy Incident Commanders must be as qualified as the Incident Commander, and that if a Deputy is assigned, he or she must be fully qualified to assume the Incident Commander’s position if required.
## Communication Responsibilities
Sharing information during an incident is a critical process. As an Incident Commander (or Deputy), you should be prepared to brief others as necessary. You will also be required to communicate your intentions and decisions clearly so that there is no ambiguity in your commands.
When given information from a responder, you should clearly acknowledge that you have received and understood their message, so that the responder can be confident in moving on to other tasks.
After an incident, you should communicate with other training Incident Commanders on any debrief actions you feel are necessary.
!!!info "Clear is better than concise."
    Remember that clear communication is better than concise communication. It can be tempting to try and abbreviate or rush speech in order to speed up the response. This can lead to confusion and misunderstandings which will ultimate increase the response time. Always favour clear communication, even if takes a little bit longer.
## Incident Call Procedures and Lingo
The [Steps for Incident Commander](../during/during_an_incident.md) provide a detailed description of what you should be doing during an incident.
Additionally, aside from following the [usual incident call etiquette](../before/call_etiquette.md), there a few extra etiquette guidelines you should follow as IC:
* Always announce when you join the call if you are the on-call IC.
* Don't let discussions get out of hand. Keep conversations short.
* Note objections from others, but your call is final.
* If anyone is being actively disruptive to your call, kick them off.
* Announce the end of the call.
Here are some examples of phrases and patterns you should use during incident calls.
### Start of Call Announcement
At the start of any major incident call, the Incident Commander should announce the following,
> This is [NAME], I am the Incident Commander for this call.
This establishes to everyone on the call what your name is, and that you are now the commander. Identify yourself by name and state that you are the "Incident Commander" and not "IC", as newcomers may not be familiar with the terminology yet. The word "commander" makes it very clear that you're in charge.
### Start of Incident, IC Not Present
If you are trained to be an IC and have joined a call, even if you aren't the IC on-call, you should do the following,
> Is there an IC on the call?
> (pause)
> Hearing no response, this is [NAME], and I am now the Incident Commander for this call.
If the on-call IC joins later, you may hand over to them at your discretion (see below for the hand-off procedure)
### Checking if SME's are Present
During a call, you will want to know who is available from the various teams in order to resolve the incident. Etiquette dictates that people should announce themselves, but sometimes you may be joining late to the call. If you need a representative from a team, just ask on the call. Your Deputy can page one if no one answers.
> Do we have a representative from [X] on the call?
> (pause)
> Deputy, can you go ahead and page the [X] on-call please.
### Assigning Tasks
When you need to give out an assignment or task, you should follow these three steps,
1. Assign the task to a specific person directly.
1. Time-box the task with a specific number of minutes.
1. Confirm that the responder has acknowledged and understood the instructions.
