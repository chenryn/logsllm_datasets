## Introduction
### Who Am I?
- Introduce a stereotype about reputation.
- **Reputation does not equate to trustworthiness!**
- Unfortunately, we often trust something based on its reputation.
- Present a case where reputation can be misleading.
- BIOS/UEFI firmware and Trusted Platform Module (TPM) are made by reputable companies.
- However, I discovered two vulnerabilities, CVE-2017-16837 and CVE-2018-6622, that can subvert the TPM.
- Discuss countermeasures and what we should do.
- **Trust nothing solely based on reputation; always verify for yourself!**

### Goal of This Talk
- To highlight the dangers of blindly trusting hardware and software based on their reputation.
- To present real-world examples of how reputable products can have critical vulnerabilities.
- To provide actionable steps to mitigate these risks.

## Previous Works
- **Reputation is based on trust!**
- We tend to believe that products from reputable companies are trustworthy.
- Reputable companies often charge higher prices, while others may offer lower-priced alternatives.
- The choice often depends on the perceived reliability and security of the product.

## Background
### Trusted Computing Group (TCG)
- Defines global industry specifications and standards.
- Members include reputable companies like Intel, AMD, IBM, HP, Dell, Lenovo, Microsoft, Cisco, Juniper Networks, and Infineon.
- Supports a hardware root of trust.
- **Trusted Platform Module (TPM)** is the core technology.
- TCG technology is applied to Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI).

### Trusted Computing Base (TCB) of TCG
- A collection of software and hardware on a host platform.
- Manages and enforces the system's security policy.
- Prevents itself from being compromised.
- The TPM ensures the TCB is properly instantiated and trustworthy.

### Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
- A tamper-resistant device with its own processor, RAM, ROM, and non-volatile RAM.
- Maintains a separate state from the system.
- Provides cryptographic and accumulating measurement functions.
- Measurement values are stored in Platform Configuration Registers (PCR #0-#23).
- Used to determine the trustworthiness of a system through local verification or remote attestation.
- Limits access to secret data based on specific PCR values.
- "Seal" operation encrypts secret data with the PCRs of the TPM.
- "Unseal" operation decrypts the sealed data only if the PCR values match the specific values.

### Root of Trust for Measurement (RTM)
- Sends integrity-relevant information (measurements) to the TPM.
- The TPM accumulates measurements to a PCR with the previously stored value.
- Controlled by Core RTM (CRTM), which is the first set of instructions when a new chain of trust is established.
- Extend: PCRnew = Hash(PCRold || Measurementnew)

### Static and Dynamic RTM (SRTM and DRTM)
- **SRTM**: Started by static CRTM (S-CRTM) when the host platform starts at POWER-ON or RESTART.
- **DRTM**: Started by dynamic CRTM (D-CRTM) at runtime without platform RESET.
- Both extend measurements (hashes) of components to PCRs before passing control to them.

### Boot Process
- **BIOS/UEFI firmware** → **Bootloader** → **Kernel** → **User Applications**
- Measurements are taken and stored in the TPM.

### Sleep and Wake-Up Processes
- **ACPI Sleeping States**:
  - S0: Normal, no context lost
  - S1: Standby, CPU cache lost
  - S2: Standby, CPU powered off
  - S3: Suspend, CPU and devices powered off
  - S4: Hibernate, CPU, devices, and RAM powered off
  - S5: Soft Off, all parts powered off
- TPM is powered off during sleep.
- On wake-up, the code is measured again.

### Vulnerabilities
#### CVE-2017-16837: "Lost Pointer" Vulnerability
- **Intel Trusted Execution Environment (TXT)**:
  - DRTM technology of TCG specification.
  - Uses terms like DCE (Secure Initialization Authenticated Code Module) and DLME (Measured Launched Environment).
  - Special commands (SENTER and SEXIT) to enter and exit the trustworthy state.
  - SENTER checks if SINIT ACM has a valid signature.
  - Intel publishes SINIT ACM on their website.

- **Trusted Boot (tBoot)**:
  - Reference implementation of Intel TXT.
  - Open source project available on SourceForge.
  - Included in Linux distributions like RedHat, SUSE, and Ubuntu.
  - Verifies OS and Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM).
  - Measures OS components and stores hashes in the TPM.
  - Verified by a remote attestation server like Intel Open CIT.
  - Typically used in server environments.

- **Memory Layout of tBoot**:
  - Multiboot Header
  - Code (.text)
  - Read-Only Data (.rodata)
  - Initialized Data (.data)
  - Uninitialized Data (.bss)
  - Measured by Intel TXT.

- **Vulnerability**:
  - Memory layout issue leading to a "lost pointer" vulnerability.
  - Can be exploited to subvert the TPM's security.

### Conclusion
- **Reputation does not guarantee trustworthiness.**
- Critical vulnerabilities can exist even in reputable products.
- Always verify and validate the security of hardware and software, regardless of their reputation.
- Implement robust security measures and stay updated on the latest security patches and best practices.

By following these guidelines, we can better protect our systems and data from potential threats.
