loading speed [42], further decreasing the search time.
Product prices. Advocates of the persuasive advertising
school predict increase in prices and consumption quantities
(therefore increasing the overall spending) due to advertising
[6, 8, 13, 21, 103], and some empirical evidence supports that
prediction [14]. However, the same empirical study shows
that participants chose advertised services with slightly lower
prices, when advertised and non-advertised goods were sim-
ilarly priced. Subjects in another lab experiment [14] on av-
erage chose services with higher prices when advertising
was available than when it was not. The presence of price
information in those ads had an effect on its own: when ads
were promoting services that had lower prices compared to
non-advertised services, subjects chose higher-priced non-
advertised services, because they suspected lower quality of
advertised services and preferred to avoid them. Yet, when
prices between advertised and non-advertised goods were sim-
ilar, participants chose advertised services with lower prices.
Satisfaction. Consumer satisfaction largely depends on the
perceived product quality and price–quality balance. While
some theoretical works predict higher quality of advertised
goods due to “quality-guarantee effects” and competition
[4, 17, 56, 100], others warn that brand and reputation—which
play a primarily persuasive role—may mislead consumers’
judgment about the high quality of the advertised products
[15], and encourage manufacturers to advertise low-quality
goods [63]. Experimental evidence demonstrates an inverted-
U shape relation between the perceived product quality and
advertising: when a company exerts reasonable efforts in ad-
vertising, consumers perceive higher product quality because
the ﬁrm seems to be sure about the quality of its products
[14], whereas when the amount of advertising is excessive,
consumers tend to associate it with lack of producers’ con-
ﬁdence [41, 60, 61, 62]. The perceptions of quality further
guide consumer satisfaction. In addition to the product quality
perceptions, ad-blockers may improve satisfaction with the
browsing experience itself, by reducing annoyance, clutter,
and distraction caused by ads.
Moderators. Some studies show that the effect of adver-
tising is moderated by product and individual consumers’
characteristics, such as durability, product involvement, fre-
quency of purchasing, and utilitarian vs. hedonic nature. For
instance, some researchers argue that advertising has a more
powerful effect on rate of return and proﬁt for non-durable
and convenience goods, which are usually lower priced, and
frequently purchased [25, 26, 82, 89, 90]. Some research
also suggests that prior experience and previous purchases
(so-called loyalty, or inertia effects) are more predictive of
purchasing decisions than advertising, whereas ads inﬂuence
more inexperienced consumers [1, 24, 29]. Bart et al. [7]
found that mobile display advertising had a bigger positive
effect on purchase intent for high-involvement and utilitar-
ian goods, consumption of which is characterized by goal-
oriented, practical functionalities. Product involvement has
also been shown to affect price acceptability: price plays a
smaller role on purchasing decisions of highly involved con-
sumers than on the decisions of consumers less involved with
a product category [39, 69, 112]. Product involvement also
positively correlates with product satisfaction [39].
As results of prior research are mixed, we believe our study
offers an important empirical contribution.
3 Method
We designed a lab experiment to test the effects of ad-blockers
on consumers’ searching and purchasing behaviors and re-
sulting outcomes. We focused on the impact of the presence
or blocking of contextual ads—primarily sponsored search
results following queries for consumer products on a popular
search engine, and to a smaller extent display ads on the vis-
ited web pages.3 We captured participants’ product choices
(including the price they would ultimately pay for products),
time spent on product searching, and satisfaction with the
products and browsing experience.
Prospective subjects answered an entry survey about their
Internet and online shopping experiences. We screened out
participants who were younger than 18 years old, who had
not made any online purchases in the last 12 months, and
who could not use a debit/credit card in the experiment.All
participants who completed the entry survey entered a rafﬂe
for a 1:50 chance to win a $50 Amazon gift card. Eligible
respondents were invited to participate in the lab experiment.
In the lab, participants sat in front of a laptop and used it to
search via Google search engine for products to buy online.
On Google, alongside organic search engine results, spon-
sored search results appear in two forms: sponsored links and
sponsored Google Shopping listings (which are usually found
on the top of the search engine result list, before organic and
sponsored links). Participants had 40 minutes to use a search
engine to search for 10 product categories, using search terms
speciﬁed by the experimenter (Table 1), and to choose, in
each category, the product and online vendor they intended
to purchase from. To account for idiosyncratic product char-
acteristics, prior to the experiment we conducted a separate
online survey to assess the characteristics of various products,
and included in the study 10 diverse product categories with
3While display ads were blocked, and their impact is reﬂected in the main
treatment effects, we do not analyse in detail the impact of particular types
of display ads (e.g., by placement on a page, or format) because we focus on
the impact on consumer economic welfare, not ad effectiveness.

The incentive mechanism used in the study is based on the
Becker-deGroot-Marschak (BDM) method [10], but is modi-
ﬁed to preserve the realism of the online shopping scenario.
We informed participants that, before the end of the experi-
ment, they would have to complete the purchase (using their
debit/credit card and personal information) of one of the prod-
ucts they had chosen, picked at random among the 10 product
categories. Therefore, participants were encouraged to select
every product carefully, as each of them had equal chances
to be eventually chosen for purchase. Participants were in-
formed that they would receive a ﬁxed $25 compensation
for the purchase, regardless of the money spent. In addition,
participants were informed that they would receive $15 for
participation in the experiment. Thus, the BDM mechanism,
coupled with the payment protocol, creates realistic incentives
to shop for desirable prices (as participants would received a
ﬁxed amount of money for their purchases) and provided an
adequate level of compensation (as average prices for each
product category were below $25—see Table 2). Participants
were free to buy a more expensive item and pay the difference
from their own money if they wanted to.4 Thus, the purchase
design was incentive-compatible, as participants faced real-
istic conditions for making economically rational decisions
within the limits of a given budget, optimizing (or minimizing)
the difference between the value of the product and its cost.
Prior research shows that moderate monetary incentives and
low-involvement goods (e.g., batteries and mugs) are enough
to generate economically rational choice behavior [55, 104].
Participants were randomly assigned to two experimental
conditions, which we will refer to as “Block” and “NoBlock.”
In the Block condition, contextual ads were blocked on sites
that the participants visited during the study (e.g., shopping

although the average price for keychains was $6. In total, participants chose

websites), and on the search engine result pages (thus, partici-
pants in this condition were only exposed to organic search en-
gine results). In the NoBlock condition, no ads were blocked;
thus, participants were exposed to contextually targeted dis-
play ads, and could choose the products from both organic
and sponsored search results.
The laptops used by participants for their searches were
instrumented differently according to the experimental con-
dition a participant was randomly assigned to. While laptops
in the Block condition were instrumented with ad-blocking
extensions,5 laptops in the NoBlock condition were not. The
ad-blockers were conﬁgured to the highest rate of effective-
ness feasible at the time [5, 28, 33, 72, 74, 75]; our own test-
ing conﬁrmed that participants in the Block condition were
exposed to nearly zero ads.
Because search engines’ algorithms run in real time, search
results are dynamic. To account for that (and show consis-
tent results to the participants), just prior to the experiment
we saved locally the ﬁrst 10 pages of search engine results
for each product category, fully preserving their original vi-
sual appearance, and presented those to the subjects as the
results of their searches. The ﬁgure in supplemental mate-
rial S16 shows how search engine result pages for the same
product category differ across conditions. By clicking on the
organic or sponsored search results subjects were directed to
the corresponding live websites and continued browsing on
the Internet in real time.7
Anecdotal evidence suggests that longer keywords associ-
ated with goal-oriented searches for speciﬁc products result
in larger rates of clicking on organic links [111]. Moreover,
consumer response (in terms of click-through and conversion
rates) is higher for branded keyword searches in [93], although
Blake at al. [12] found no measurable short-term evidence
of such effect. To account for the degree of speciﬁcity and
the presence of brand names among keywords in the search
query, we used both generic and speciﬁc searches. Out of
the 10 searches each participant was expected to complete, 6
search terms were generic, unbranded product categories, e.g.,
“a book,” while 4 others were speciﬁc and branded products,
e.g., “Cruzer ﬂash drive 8Gb” (Table 1). Participants were
instructed not to modify search terms or to type vendors’ URL
directly in the address bar.
The order of product searches was randomized across
participants. To prevent contamination of search results via
browsing activities across product categories and participants,

7This methodology preserves only the order of search results, while the
websites can still vary in their content over time. However, the expected ﬂuc-
tuations of price, product availability, and display on the vendors’ websites
are small; we controlled for that ex-post using the data recorded through
screen-capturing software and saved web pages of visited websites.

subjects searched each product in an independent browser
proﬁle. Browsing history, cache, cookies, and temporary ﬁles
were automatically deleted after each participant.8
At the end of the 40 minutes, participants were informed
that one of the product categories they had been searching
for would now be selected at random. Participants were then
asked to complete the actual purchase of the product they had
selected under that product category, using their credit cards
and personal information. After completing the purchase, par-
ticipants responded to an exit survey about satisfaction with
the product selection and browsing experience.
During the experiment, in addition to their survey answers,
we collected participants’ complete browsing history logs
with time stamps, visited web pages in HTML format, screen-
shots of the chosen products’ pages, and URLs and ship-
ping cost of the chosen products using a custom desktop
application. All browsing activity during the experiment was
recorded using a screen-capturing software. Some weeks after
the experiment (after the estimated delivery date of the prod-
uct they had purchased), participants answered a follow-up
survey. Through that survey, we collected participants’ ex-post
satisfaction with the purchased product.
Statistical analysis. We conduct the analysis in two ways:
univariate statistical tests of means or proportions, and multi-
variate regression analysis. The main results (estimating the
average impact of the treatment) are consistent across the two
approaches. However, the regression analysis allows more
precise investigation by controlling for explanatory factors.
In regression analysis of the prices of chosen products, search
time, and satisfaction with the browsing experience, we use
linear mixed models with individual participant random ef-
fects, ﬁxed effects for all other covariates, and robust standard
errors. We use ordered logit regression models for other met-
rics of satisfaction measured on a 7-point Likert scale.9
While in the descriptive analysis we analyze product prices
in absolute terms (as inferred from the screenshots of cho-
sen products), in the regressions we compare the relative
(rather than absolute) differences in these prices across prod-
uct categories, so as to account for heterogeneity in product
categories. Speciﬁcally, we subtract means of log prices for
each product category from individual products’ log prices
and use the resulting metrics as the main dependent variable
(price_log).10
8However, we cannot rule out whether the behavioral targeting occurred
within, not across, a particular searching session, while the participant was
searching for a speciﬁc product. While trackers could potentially use IP
address or deploy browser ﬁngerprinting, this information is not enough for
constructing meaningful user proﬁle for behavioral targeting, without related
browsing history and cookies.
9The model speciﬁcations with interactions between the treatment and
prior experience with ad-blockers revealed no signiﬁcant interaction effects.
They are available from the authors on request.
10For sensitivity checks, we use two additional measures of price: 1) prices
divided by product category means (price_mean), and 2) prices divided by
In addition, we control for the following covariates:
• “Speciﬁc branded search query,” binary (Table 1);
• “Durable product”—product that is not consumed im-
mediately but gradually worn out during use over an
extended period of time—binary (Table 1);
• “Hedonic product” deﬁned by the participants’ responses
on a 9-point Likert scale, with 1 for utilitarian product
(purely useful, practical, functional) and 9 for hedonic
product (purely fun, enjoyable, appealing to the senses);
• “Order of the product searching,” between 1 and 10;
• “Perceived difﬁculty of the study” deﬁned by the partici-
pants’ responses on a 7-point Likert scale to a question
about how difﬁcult it was for them to make the decisions
about products in the experiment;
• “Home computer ad-blocker user” deﬁned as 1 for the
participants who reported using ad-blocker on a personal
home computer, and 0 otherwise;
