User: I have checked out a folder from SVN to my desktop. Actually I need to extract the information like SVN revision no, URL and status for the specific file in the local working copy. Here is the line of code which I am using to extract those info.
file = svn.local.LocalClient(filePath[i][j])
fileInfo = file.info()
This works perfectly fine in my desktop. But the same thing when I tried to do it in my laptop it throws the following error
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in 
  File "C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\svn-0.3.22-py2.7.egg\svn\common.py", line 134, in export

    errread, errwrite)
  File "C:\Python27\lib\subprocess.py", line 948, in _execute_child
    startupinfo)
WindowsError: [Error 2] The system cannot find the file specified
Can anyone pls help me what is wrong? I have installed all the packages which I installed in my desktop. But don't know what is the problem exactly.
Thanks
Assistant: I got the solution for this. Actually the problem was with subversion command line client version. The client version need to be higher than the TortoiseSVN server version, whereas mine was a lower version which created this problem. Now it works fine :)
