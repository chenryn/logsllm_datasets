### A Taxonomy of Censorship
- **Generalized Blocking**
  - **Blocking Publishers/Servers**
  - **Blocking Receivers/Clients**
  - **Modifying Content for Censorship**
- **Surveillance and Chilling Effects**
  - Relies on accountability and punishment
  - Effective censors use multiple techniques

---

### Blocking Publishers
- **Example:** Bonsai Kitten Picture from bonsaikitten.com
- **Challenges:**
  - Hardest form of censorship (e.g., spam)
  - Offensive material forbidden by government, ISPs, or DoS attackers

---

### Circumventing Publisher Blocking
- **Strategies:**
  - Find someone who will make the material available
  - Use more permissive ISPs
  - Utilize writable web pages (blogs, etc.)
  - Operate outside jurisdictional boundaries
  - Employ anonymity services
  - Hidden servers can help avoid DoS attacks
  - Current systems may be too fragile

---

### Blocking Receivers
- **Scenarios:**
  - Government firewalls at routers
  - Corporate firewalls
  - Nannyware in schools and libraries

---

### Blocking Techniques
- **Methods:**
  - Drop packets at gateway based on IP address
  - DNS redirection
  - Keyword filtering
  - Image-based filtering ("Finding Naked People")
  - Block loophole servers
  - Proxies, anonymizers, translators, Google cache, Wayback Machine, etc.

---

### Circumvention Methods
- **Tools:**
  - Proxies
  - Tunnels
  - Mirrors
  - Email (spam)
  - P2P systems to distribute proxies
  - Examples: Safeweb/Triangle-Boy, Six/Four, Peek-a-booty, Infranet

---

### Publicizing the Circumvention System
1. **Limited Use:** Communicate out of band with a small group.
2. **Use Unblocked Channels:** Communicate using channels that cannot be blocked.
3. **Closed Group:** Ensure no one sees the whole pattern.
   - **Infranet:** Keyspace-hopping (client puzzles)
   - **TU Dresden:** Captchas
   - **Limitation:** May not work against resource-rich adversaries

---

### Steganography in Circumvention Systems
- **Benefits:**
  - Makes proxy servers harder to detect and block
  - Provides plausible deniability for clients
- **Examples:**
  - **Infranet (MIT NMS):** Embeds content requests in HTTP sequences and steganographically in images.
  - **Camera Shy (Hacktivismo):** Uses LSB steganography and automatically scans and parses web pages for applications.

### Case Study: Internet Censorship in China
- **Goals:**
  - Block dissident websites and pornography
  - Prevent fomenting change/unrest
  - Coordinate against dissidents
- **Main Dissident Groups:**
  - Falun Gong
  - Chinese Democratic Party
  - Tibetan/Taiwanese sites
- **Additional Blocks:**
  - News, health, education, government, and religious sites

---

### PRC Resources
- **Control of Routers:** Inside China
- **Cooperative ISPs:** For internet access
- **Sophisticated Surveillance:** Network and internet cafes
- **Human Resources:** Approximately 30,000+ employees to find and filter sites
- **Legal Authority:** To arrest, detain, and interrogate suspicious individuals

---

### Evolution of Chinese Censorship
- **Timeline:**
  - **1995:** Commercial internet availability in China
  - **1996:** "Great Firewall of China"
  - **1997:** Regulations place liability on ISPs
  - **1999:** Foreign dissident sites subjected to DoS attacks
  - **2000:** Golden Shield and Security China 2000
  - **2001:** Safeweb/Triangle Boy blocked; capital crime for providing state secrets
  - **2002:** Pledge of Self-Discipline for Chinese Internet Industry; DNS hijacking
  - **2002-2004:** More granular blocking, cafe surveillance, SMS monitoring

---

### The Sad Story of Safeweb
- **Initial Setup:** Proxy service, quickly blocked
- **P2P Network:** Set up, also blocked
- **Resource Limitations:** China's resources allow quick discovery and blocking of peers
- **Involuntary Servers:** Using safe ports and IIS servers proved ineffective

---

### VIP Reference
- **Dissident Email Newsletter:** [http://come.to/dck](http://come.to/dck)
- **Success:** Widespread circumvention
- **Repercussions:** Lin Hai sentenced to 2 years for providing email addresses to overseas publications

---

### Implications Outside China
- **Routed Traffic:** Subject to filtering
- **Root Nameserver:** Potential for DNS hijacking
- **Common Carrier Status:** Concerns about global impact

---

### Censorship in a "Free" Society
- **Document Distortion or Removal:**
  - Form of blocking where previously available items are changed or disappear
  - Example: Time Magazine article removal
  - Mitigation: Digital signatures
  - Self-censorship is common

---

### The LOCKSS Project
- **Purpose:**
  - Libraries help prevent document distortion by preserving documents in multiple locations
  - P2P system to archive documents and avoid bit rot
  - Maintain consensus on correct documents
- **Similar Initiatives:**
  - Wayback Machine, Memoryhole, Cryptome, Google Cache

---

### Unobservability as Censorship Resistance
- **Concept:**
  - Hides both content and the fact that covert communication is taking place
  - Examples: Steganography, covert channels
  - Helps circumvent surveillance and blocking
  - Facilitates two-way dissident communication

---

### Limitations of Encryption
- **Challenges:**
  - May be forbidden or bring suspicion
  - Censoring authority may gain keys (e.g., Britain)
  - Requires coordination and technical sophistication

---

### Properties for Unobservable Systems
- **Undetectability:**
  - Plausible cover
  - Statistically matched encoding
- **Robustness:**
  - Survives natural and malicious lossiness
- **Indispensability:**
  - Essential for effective unobservability

---

### Limitations of Unobservability
- **Security Guarantees:**
  - Hard to ensure undetectability
  - Many "unobservable" methods are detectable
  - Security through obscurity is often insufficient

---

### Pitfalls of Randomness
- **Issues:**
  - Embedding cryptographic output in non-random sources is obvious
  - Bits are generally not random
  - Example: TCP timestamps

---

### Image Steganography
- **LSB Steganography:**
  - Detectable, especially with blind JPEG steg detection
  - Arms race between detection and embedding
- **Image Choice Steganography:**
  - Low bandwidth but robust and hard to detect
  - Fotoblogs as a potential channel

---

### Conclusions
- **Circumvention:**
  - Easy on a small scale, difficult on a large scale
  - Distribution of circumvention systems is the hardest challenge
- **Arms Race:**
  - Can lead to the blocking of working methods
  - Increases the cost for circumventors
- **Surveillance:**
  - Users must be aware of risks
