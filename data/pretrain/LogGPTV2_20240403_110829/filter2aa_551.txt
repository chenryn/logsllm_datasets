Tools for Censorship Resistance – p.1/37
Overview
Approaches to Censorship
Circumvention methods
Case study: China
Censorship in a “free” society
the LOCKSS project
Unobservability
Tools for Censorship Resistance – p.2/37
A Taxonomy of Censorship
Generalized Blocking
Blocking publishers/servers
Blocking receivers/clients
Modifying content for censorship
"Arms race" solutions okay
Surveillance/Chilling Effects
Relies on accountability/punishment
Effective censors use multiple techniques
Tools for Censorship Resistance – p.3/37
Blocking Publishers
Figure 1: Bonsai kitten picture
from bonsaikitten.com
Hardest form
of censorship
to do (spam)
Offensive
material
for-
bidden
by
govt/ISP/DOS
attackers
Tools for Censorship Resistance – p.4/37
Circumventing Publisher Blocking
Find someone who will make material
available
More permitting ISP
Writable web pages (blogs, etc)
Outside jurisdictions
Anonymity services
Can help if publisher blocking is combined
with surveillance
Hidden servers may prove useful for
avoiding DOS attacks
Current systems probably too fragile
Tools for Censorship Resistance – p.5/37
Blocking Receivers
If the blocking authority has control over some,
but not all, internet users
Government ﬁrewalls at routers
Corporate ﬁrewalls
Nannyware in schools/libraries
Tools for Censorship Resistance – p.6/37
Blocking Approaches 1
Web Site Blocked
The website you were trying to access was deemed inappropriate by the Authorities. If
you feel that this particular web site should not have been blocked per our policy, you
may ask that the web site be removed from the blocked list by going to the following
website.
If you have any questions, contact us at internetpolice@authority.net.

Blocking Approaches 2
Tools for Censorship Resistance – p.8/37
Blocking Techniques
Block open or closed?
Drop packets at gateway based on IP address
DNS redirection
Filter based on keywords
Filter based on images ("Finding Naked
People")
Block loophole servers
Proxies/anonymizers/translators/google
cache/wayback machine/etc

Tools for Censorship Resistance – p.10/37
Circumvention Methods
Proxies
Tunnels
Mirrors
Email (spam)
P2P systems to make proxies available
Safeweb/Triangle-Boy, Six/Four,
Peek-a-booty, Infranet
Tools for Censorship Resistance – p.11/37
Publicizing the circumvention system
1. You don’t: used by small set of people,
communicate out of band
2. Use something to communicate that they
won’t or can’t block
This may be harder than you think
3. Closed group: no one sees the whole pattern
Infranet: keyspace-hopping (client puzzles)
TU Dresden: captchas
Won’t work against a resource rich
adversary
Tools for Censorship Resistance – p.12/37
Stego in Circumvention Systems
Can make proxy servers more difﬁcult to detect
and block, clients have plausible deniability
Infranet (MIT NMS)—embed requests for
content in the sequence of http requests,
embed content itself steganographically in
images
Camera Shy (Hacktivismo)—uses lsb
steganography. Automatically scans and
parses web pages for applications

Tools for Censorship Resistance – p.15/37
Internet Censorship in China
Use publisher/receiver blocking, surveillance
Makes evident how much of “cyberspace” is
tied to national borders and how much isn’t
Opaque system, closed blocking
Tools for Censorship Resistance – p.16/37
Goals
Block dissident websites and pornography
Belief that access to the Internet would
foment change/unrest
Also—Internet used as coordination tool for
dissidents
3 main dissident groups (Rand)
Falun Gong
Chinese Democratic Party
Tibetan/Taiwanese sites
Also block news, health, education, gov’t, religion
Tools for Censorship Resistance – p.17/37
PRC Resources
Control of routers inside China
Internet access in country through
cooperative ISPs
Sophisticated network and Internet cafe
surveillance
approx 30,000+ employees to ﬁnd sites to
ﬁlter (Big Mamas/volunteers)
Ability to arrest/detain/interrogate suspicious
individuals
Tools for Censorship Resistance – p.18/37

Safeweb/Triangle Boy blocked
2001
Capital crime to “provide state secrets” over Internet
2002
Pledge of Self-Discipline for Chinese Internet Industry
2002
DNS hijacking
Tools for Censorship Resistance – p.19/37
Evolution of Chinese Censorship
2002
Attempt to block google -> keyword blocking
2002
More ﬁ ne grained blocking (CNN, blogspot)
2002
Internet cafe ﬁ re, PRC closes cafes
2002
Cafes required to install surveillance software
2002
Downtime punishment
2004
est. 87 million Internet users in China
2004
PRC monitoring SMS text messages
Tools for Censorship Resistance – p.20/37
Sad Story of Safeweb
Set up a proxy service, got blocked
Set a P2P network of proxies, they got blocked
Almost immediately
With their resources, China can discover the peers and
block them, even with rate limiting measures
You try getting a P2P network up and running this way
Involuntary servers? (In a windows app?)
On a safe port—blocked
A gazillon IIS servers, there’s a good idea...
Tools for Censorship Resistance – p.21/37
But they wouldn’t block X...
Only a few sites they unblocked (google,
blogspot)
Even these they do selective blocking
And random P2P servers aren’t likely to be
useful to them for anything
Don’t expect companies to help you
We’re selling them surveillance tech
They’ve signed self-discipline pledges too
Tools for Censorship Resistance – p.22/37
VIP Reference
Dissident email newsletter
(http://come.to/dck)
Most successful widespread circumvention
Spam’s a hard problem
Sent to prominent party members, random
Chinese, and dissidents
Not without repercussions: Lin Hai sentenced
to 2 years in prison for providing 30,000 email
addresses to “overseas hostile publications”
Tools for Censorship Resistance – p.23/37
Implications Outside China
Trafﬁc routed through China subject to ﬁltering
Root nameserver in China could cause
people outside China to be subject to DNS
hijacking
Common carrier status?

Document distortion or removal
Form of blocking, previously available items
are changed or disappear
Concern in U.S. (talk at PORTIA)
Can be mitigated with digital signatures
BUT—Often self-censorship
Tools for Censorship Resistance – p.27/37
Example: Time Magazine
This article
was removed
from Time’s
online website
Also excised
from the Table
of Contents
From
memoryhole.org
Tools for Censorship Resistance – p.28/37
LOCKSS: Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe
Libraries help prevent document distortion by
preserving documents in many locations
LOCKSS is a P2P system to help libraries
Archive documents and avoid bit rot
Maintain consensus about which document
is correct
Some online sources doing similar things
(wayback machine, memoryhole, cryptome,
google cache)

Tools for Censorship Resistance – p.30/37
Unobservability as Censorship Resistance
Unobservability hides both the content and
the fact that covert communication is taking
place
Examples: steganography, covert channels
Can help circumvent surveillance
And blocking (can’t block what you don’t know
is there)
Dissident two-way communication
Tools for Censorship Resistance – p.31/37
Limitations of Encryption
It may be forbidden, or bring unwelcome
suspicion
Censoring authority may have the ability to
gain keys (Britain)
Many systems built to avoid this problem
Requires some degree of
coordination(keys)/technical sophistication
Tools for Censorship Resistance – p.32/37
Properties for Unobservable Systems
Undetectability
Plausible (legitimate cover)
Encode the message to match channel
statistically
Robustness
Message survive natural/malicious
lossiness
Indispensable
Tools for Censorship Resistance – p.33/37
Limitations of Unobservability
Hard to have security guarantees about
detectability
Many ’unobservable’ approaches are
detectable—security through obscurity
Especially true if you are worried about the
channel being blocked
Tools for Censorship Resistance – p.34/37
Pitfalls of Randomness
Images from Westfeld’s attacks
on steganographic systems
Embedding cryptographic output
in nonrandom sources is obvious
In general, bits are not random
I made this mistake with TCP
timestamps
Tools for Censorship Resistance – p.35/37
Image Steganography
LSB steganography is detectable. Easily.
Increasingly good blind jpeg steg detection
(Fridrich)
Certainly an arms race
Robustness?
Image choice steganography
Very low bandwidth
But robust, hard to detect
Fotoblogs...
Tools for Censorship Resistance – p.36/37
Conclusions
Circumvention is easy to do on small scale,
hard to do on large scale
Hardest problem is distributing circumvention
systems, without having them blocked
Arms race double edged
Can cause working circumvention methods
to get blocked
Make circumventor pay higher price for
control
With surveillance, need to make sure users
aware of risks
