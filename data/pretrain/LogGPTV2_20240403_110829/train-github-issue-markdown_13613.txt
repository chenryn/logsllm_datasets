I am working on a script against an app which performs backend queries via
graphql. Request path is the same, only body in POST requests are different.
When I manually visit one section of the site which displays various data I
can clearly see multiple graphql queries with different content. However when
I run it in a playwright script only first one issued and responded, rest of
them do not fire up. This issue happens in puppeteer as well, but not selenium
which handles it correctly.
For example when I visit page manually 3 requests are issued (also via
selenium):
  * graphql1
  * graphql2
  * graphql3
In case of Playwright and Puppeteer only first one is issued, **graphql2** and
**graphql3** are not visible in devtools (it's also noticeable on page which
lacks data)
Question is - is there a special way to handle such scenarios in Playwright?
Is there some magic in the background that blocks requests considered
duplicates and can be turned off?
