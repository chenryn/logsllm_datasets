User: I dont want to open a command window when i am Running application, 
I directed shortcut to .bat file while creating .exe file where the application is python based
Code in .bat file is like this
@python\python.exe -m demo.demo %*
where demo is my application name (.bat file name)
Assistant: Run your script with pythonw.exe instead of python.exe and it won't show dos shell.
