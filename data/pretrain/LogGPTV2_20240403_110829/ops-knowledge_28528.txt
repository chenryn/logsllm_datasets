Certainly! Hereâ€™s a more polished and professional version of your text:

I do not want to open a command window when running my application. I have created a shortcut to a `.bat` file while generating the `.exe` file for my Python-based application. The code in the `.bat` file is as follows:

```batch
@python\python.exe -m demo.demo %*
```

where `demo` is the name of my application (and also the name of the `.bat` file).

**Solution:**
To prevent the command window from appearing, you can use `pythonw.exe` instead of `python.exe`. This will run your script without showing the DOS shell.

This version is clearer, more structured, and maintains a professional tone.
