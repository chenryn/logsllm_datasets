### Current Behavior:
If you have a package with `something` in `peerDependencies` and then install
that something in the same package as a devDependency, the peerDependencies
field is changed and the dependency is added to `package.json`, but it
inherits the semver string that the peer dependency had.
### Expected Behavior:
Installing a dev dependency should do the same change to the `package.json`,
whether that dependency is already in `peerDependencies` or not.
### Steps To Reproduce:
    echo '{ "peerDependencies": { "typescript": "*" } }' > package.json
    npm i -D typescript
    cat package.json
    {"peerDependencies":{"typescript":"^4.2.4"},"devDependencies":{"typescript":"*"}}
### Environment:
  * OS: macOS
  * Node: 15.14.0
  * npm: 7.10.0
