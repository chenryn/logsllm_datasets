The Autocomplete demo suggestion container takes up room even when not in use
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Put two autocompletes above each other (or any other element below an
autocomplete) and it will sit flush against the bottom
## Current Behavior
There is around a 200px height gap between autocomplete and the control below
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
https://codesandbox.io/s/mj5q02oo58
  1. Load codesandbox
  2. See two autocompletes
  3. Note that there is a large gap between the two
## Context
I fixed it by changing the css. I removed the `container` key and changed
`suggestionsContainerOpen` to the following.
    suggestionsContainerOpen: {
        flexGrow: 1,
        position: 'relative',
        minHeight: 200,
        marginTop: theme.spacing.unit,
        marginBottom: theme.spacing.unit * 3,
        left: 0,
        right: 0,
      },
So this is not impacting me. However, your Component Demos are awesome and
this caused me some confusion. For future visitors it might be nice to change
this behavior.
