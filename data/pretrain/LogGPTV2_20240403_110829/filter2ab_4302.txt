**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Account Use Policies

To mitigate the risk of password guessing, implement account lockout policies that trigger after a specified number of failed login attempts. However, it is important to strike a balance; overly strict policies can lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition, where multiple accounts become locked out, rendering the environment unusable.

Additionally, leverage conditional access policies to block logins from non-compliant devices or from IP addresses outside the defined organizational range. This approach enhances security by ensuring that only authorized and secure devices can access sensitive resources.
