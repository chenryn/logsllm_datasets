# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
Toggle to remove/replace the shortcut arrows on desktop icons
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
It's a simple registry edit, detailed at https://www.windowscentral.com/how-
get-rid-shortcut-arrows-windows-10
That said, many people dislike mucking about in the registry due to the
potential to bork the computer.
I would like a switch that toggles shortcut arrows on/off, even if the user
needs to log out & back in again to see the change (prefer it not be
necessary, but code is code)
