### Problem description
The `Text` component in the `next` branch causes a naming collision with the
global Text that is available in browsers.
To avoid confusion and misleading errors it might be better to choose a
different name.
Some ideas so far: `Typography`, `Font`. The former probably makes the
connection to the MD guidelines a bit clearer, despite being a bit more wordy.
### Versions
  * Material-UI: `next` branch
  * React: All
  * Browser: All
