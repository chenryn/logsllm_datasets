User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Log/Save domain users login/logout time on Windows Server 2008 R2 My idea is to make log-in and log-out scripts to capture the login/logout time and save it
 to a file (or into a Database). I have no idea how to capture the time.

Assistant: The easiest thing to do - that I would do to collect the most potentially relevant information - is to create batch scripts with the following lines (and place the batch scripts in Group Policy logon and logoff scripts - with .cmd extensions)

for logon:

echo %username% logged on from %computername% on %date% at %time%>>\server\share\logon.log

and for logout:

echo %username% logged off from %computername% on %date% at %time%>>\server\share\logoff.log

(You can use the same file and don't need to separate them, but for convenience, I split them into two files).

The above should append a line to the files logon.log or logoff.log (as appropriate) with the user's account name, the computer that the user logged in from, and the date and time.

By opening the file in excel and using the text-to-columns feature, you can easily create sortable reports.  (And you can leave off the text simplifying the logged data into something like echo %username%,%computername%,%date%,%time%)
