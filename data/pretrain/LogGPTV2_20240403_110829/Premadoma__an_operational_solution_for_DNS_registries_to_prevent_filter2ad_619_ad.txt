### Structural and Administrative Services Used by Cybercriminals

This section discusses the structural and administrative services, such as registrars and name servers, that are frequently utilized by cybercriminals. These components represent approximately 1.5% of the entire registry's zone.

### Model Validation and Performance Testing

**Validation Period:**
- **Duration:** June 2015
- **Purpose:** To select the best models and parameters.

**Performance Testing:**
- **Duration:** July 2015 to May 2016 (11 months)
- **Process:** The prediction model uses a sliding window on a daily basis. Each day, the model is trained on data from the previous 15 to 60 days.

### Featureset for Reputation-Based Classification and Similarity-Based Clustering

The following table outlines the features used for reputation-based classification ('Cla' column) and similarity-based clustering ('Clu' column).
