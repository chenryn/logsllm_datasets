**Describe the feature** : At the moment there is no single point of truth of
all possible Elasticsearch settings.  
By that i mean both settings that are configured in the `elasticsearch.yml` &
ones that are configured on a specific index (For example in a template).
It would be extremely helpful to have a single page where you can just search
for settings and read about them.
Thanks
