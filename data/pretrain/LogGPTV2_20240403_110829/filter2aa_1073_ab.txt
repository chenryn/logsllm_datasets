4) Standard Protocols
• Overview
• Our choice of protocol does not define us
• Creating a file sharing app is art and science
• Creating a message protocol is wizardry
• Benefits
• Obfuscation
• Interoperability
• Undetectable transfers
• The Solution
• Keep a low profile
• Use pre-existing protocols and standards
• HTTP, XML, JSON, etc.
Saving Cyberspace means that we need to leverage existing protocols
