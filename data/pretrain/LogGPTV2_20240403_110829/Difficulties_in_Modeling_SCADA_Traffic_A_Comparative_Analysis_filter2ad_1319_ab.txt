### Self-Similarity Analysis of Network Traffic

#### 4.2 Self-Similarity

One of the key requirements for a random variable to exhibit self-similarity is that it must be wide-sense stationary [4]. This implies, among other things, that the mean remains constant over time. Due to diurnal patterns of activity, network traffic is not truly self-similar [8]. However, network measurements with durations up to a few hours do present self-similar time series [4,6]. Other sources of non-stationarity include singular events that cause drastic changes in network behavior, such as maintenance operations or changes in physical processes (see Section 3.2). For the following analysis, we have selected periods of a few hours from our datasets where the stationarity requirement is satisfied.

The self-similarity analysis was performed on the pkts/s and bytes/s time series with 100 millisecond bins for all datasets. The results for the bytes/s are analogous to those for pkts/s and, therefore, are omitted. Figure 3 illustrates the R/S plot, variance-time plots, and periodograms for the IT trace in the first row (Figures 3a, 3b, and 3c, respectively) and the 3layer-control trace in the second row (Figures 3d, 3e, and 3f, respectively). The results for the other SCADA datasets are similar and thus are not shown.

- **R/S Plot**: The R/S plot of a self-similar random variable should have an asymptotic slope between 0.5 and 1 (represented by the black dotted lines). The slope is typically estimated using least-square fitting (represented by the red dotted line). Figures 3a and 3d clearly show that the IT trace exhibits self-similar behavior, while the 3layer-control trace does not.
- **Variance-Time Plot**: In the variance-time plot test, the slope of the resulting curve should be shallower than -1 (black dotted line). This test indicates that the variance of the SCADA time series decays much faster than expected for a self-similar process. In contrast, the IT dataset results are consistent with traditional network measurements.
- **Periodogram Test**: Applying this method, we obtain a Hurst parameter estimate of H = 0.79 for the IT dataset and H = 0.44 for the 3layer-control dataset. Note that the Hurst parameter of a self-similar process should be in the interval H ∈ [0.5, 1).

Table 2 summarizes the results of our analysis, reporting the estimates for the Hurst parameter from the R/S analysis, variance-time plots, and periodograms. All estimates for the SCADA datasets indicate non-self-similar behavior, although the estimates are not consistent between tests. In contrast, the IT dataset shows more consistent estimates of the Hurst parameter, which is in agreement with a self-similar behavior. It is important to note that while the R/S analysis and periodograms yield a single estimate, the variance-time plots produce a small range of estimates. This is because for both small and large aggregation levels m, there is a considerable amount of variance that should not be taken into account when performing the least-square fit. In our analysis, we remove up to 15% of either end of the variance-time plot to obtain the Hurst estimates.

#### 4.3 Distributional Aspects of Connection Sizes

As discussed in Section 3.3, there is ongoing debate in the research community about which distribution best fits the tail behavior of connection sizes: heavy-tail (usually Pareto-distributed) or log-normal. We illustrate both behaviors for the IT trace. 

- **Packets per Flow (Figure 4a)**: The CCDF presents an almost constant slope, indicating that a Pareto model might provide a good fit.
- **Flow Duration (Figure 4b)**: The behavior is closer to that of a log-normal distribution, with an increasing slope when approaching extreme values in the tail.

For the SCADA datasets, the results are not always conclusive. For example, the connection size in packets (Figure 4a) for the 2layer dataset could be modeled as Pareto if the tail is considered to consist of values above 10^2. In contrast, the 3layer-control dataset's CCDF shows large variations and cannot be approximated by either model. When considering duration, the 2layer and 3layer-control CCDFs present different slopes at different ranges. The CCDF of 3layer-control (Figure 4b) has a relatively small slope up to 10 seconds, sharply increases in the interval [10, 10^3], and then sharply reduces. Finally, the tail of the 3layer-field dataset for both metrics is dominated by a small range of values, producing nearly vertical lines in both plots.

Regardless of the best model to represent the connection size distribution, all datasets share a common characteristic: the connection size distribution is always positively skewed, with a body containing the majority of the values and a tail with extreme values on the right.

### Conclusions

The goal of this paper was to verify if models used to describe traditional network traffic can also be applied to SCADA traffic. To this end, we analyzed SCADA traffic traces collected at two water treatment and distribution facilities and compared their characteristics with those of traditional network traffic. Our analysis was based on a list of network traffic invariants widely observed in network measurements.

Our conclusions are as follows:

1. **Diurnal Patterns**: SCADA networks do not exhibit the diurnal patterns of activity common to traditional IT networks, as most of the traffic is generated by automated processes with little human interaction.
2. **Self-Similarity**: Self-similar correlations in the time series are not present in SCADA networks. Our results suggest that simple ON/OFF models might provide a good approximation for the time series.
3. **Distribution Models**: Neither heavy-tail nor log-normal models seem to provide a good fit for the connection sizes in SCADA networks.

In summary, our results indicate that existing traffic models cannot be easily applied to SCADA traffic. To our knowledge, this is the first study on real-world SCADA traces. Since existing publications on SCADA networks generally do not rely on empirical data, we believe that our findings are a first step towards constructing realistic SCADA traffic models to support future research in the area. In future work, we intend to extend our analysis of SCADA traffic, including the characterization of the flow arrival process and the extraction of periodic patterns.
