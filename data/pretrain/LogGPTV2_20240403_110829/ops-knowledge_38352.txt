User: How do you create multiple HTTPDownloader instance with partial download asynchronously? and does it assemble the file automatically after all download is done?
Assistant: You must use Range HTTP header:

Range. Request only part of an entity.
  Bytes are numbered from 0.    Range:
  bytes=500-999

Ie. If you want download 1000 file in 4 parts, you will starts 4 downloads:

0-2499
2500-4999
5000-7499
7500-9999

And then simply join data from responses.
To check file size you can use HEAD method:

HEAD Asks for the response identical
  to the one that would correspond to a
  GET request, but without the response
  body. This is useful for retrieving
  meta-information written in response
  headers, without having to transport
  the entire content.
