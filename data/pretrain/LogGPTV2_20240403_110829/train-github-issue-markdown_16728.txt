... for the syntax suggested in "go help importpath" (no ".git" suffixing the
url)
I've managed to make private repos work by appending ".git" to the url.
However this complicates things since the filesystem install path will now
include the ".git". Also, the import statements must then have it.
There are tons of questions about this issue (or private repos in general) all
over stackoverflow etc. etc. and many answers or posts give confusing or old
information that makes go hard to use for newcomers. The go packaging is hard
enough to grasp for newcomers as it is; combine that with these private repo
issues and the result is no doubt three times as difficult.
