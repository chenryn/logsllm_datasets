5The feasibility of public testing is actually essential to cho-
sen ciphertext security with our approach, since the simula-
tor relies on it to properly answer the decryption queries in
the proofs of security [9].
into a CCA2-secure threshold public key system using a gen-
eralization of the CHK conversion, taking advantage of the
fact that in the conversion anyone can check that a cipher-
text is valid.
By contrast, we propose a direct approach that trades gen-
erality for even more eﬃciency. Indeed, by applying a sim-
ple secret sharing scheme to either the encryption system of
Section 3 or the KEM of Section 4, and using the public va-
lidity test of Section 5.1, we directly obtain a CCA2-secure
non-interactive threshold system in the standard model. Al-
though this approach bears a lot of resemblance to the thresh-
old system from [4] due to its roots in identity-based tech-
niques, we are able to sidestep the generic IBE-to-CCA2
conversion (and the signing step it requires) by virtue of
the inherently chosen ciphertext security of our underlying
public-key construction.
A detailed construction of the key encapsulation version
of the threshold system may be found in the full version of
our paper [9].
5.3 Hierarchical Identity-Based
Encryption
Since our constructions are based on the Waters and Boneh-
Boyen IBE systems, both of which support hierarchical key
generation [18, 17], a natural question to ask is whether
the same approach can be applied to directly obtain CCA2-
secure HIBE systems without having to resort to use signa-
tures of MAC.
It is easy to see that we obtain the desired result very
simply, by extending the hierarchy in either HIBE construc-
tion by one level, and setting the “identity” for that last
level to be the hash value of the previous ciphertext com-
ponents. This gives us (in the Waters case) an adaptive-
identity CCA2-secure HIBE, and (in the Boneh-Boyen case)
a selective-identity CCA2-secure HIBE-KEM.
With a twist, the same approach can be also used with the
constant size ciphertext HIBE recently proposed by Boneh,
Boyen, and Goh [4]. One of the features of their system
is that it is algebraically compatible with the Boneh-Boyen
(H)IBE; indeed its authors show how to design a hybrid
of the two systems. In such a hybrid, it is straightforward
to design the last level of the hierarchy to be a “Boneh-
Boyen” level, and use it for our “checksum” construction.
This results in a selective-identity, CCA2-secure hierarchical
identity-based KEM with short ciphertexts.
6. DISCUSSION AND COMPARISONS
In this section we draw comparisons between our scheme
and the other CCA2-secure encryption schemes built from
identity-based encryption. Additionally, we describe qualata-
tive diﬀerences between the methods of deriving a CCA2-
secure encryption scheme from IBE and previous methods
that ﬁt under the two-key paradigm as described by Elkind
and Sahai [16].
We begin by examining the commonalities between the
three CCA2-secure schemes derived from IBE: CHK [11],
BK [8] and ours. All three techniques follow a similar method
in their proof simulation. After the setup phase there are
a certain set of well-formed ciphertexts that the simulator
can decrypt corresponding to “identities” that the simula-
tor knows the private keys for. The simulator is unable to
decrypt the remainder of the well-formed ciphertexts; these
can therefore be used as challenge ciphertexts in the simu-
lation. These ciphertexts that the simulator cannot decrypt
correspond to identities for which the simulator does not
know the private key.
All three IBE-like methods are fundamentally diﬀerent
from those that ﬁt under the two-key paradigm [16], where
a ciphertext consists of the dual encryption of the same mes-
sage, accompanied with some non-interactive zero-knowledge
proof that the two messages are the same.
In these sys-
tems, the simulator always possesses one of the two keys,
and is thus able to decrypt all well-formed ciphertexts by
decrypting one or the other component. Consequently, the
adversary must be challenged on a ciphertext that is not well
formed. Using this type of simulation, clearly an adversary
must not be able to tell whether a ciphertext is well formed
or not; otherwise, the adversary could distinguish the chal-
lenge ciphertext from a normal one. In contrast, challenge
ciphertexts in IBE-like schemes are always well formed, and
(except in BK) anyone is able to tell.
We now focus on the diﬀerences between the IBE-like con-
structions. We just saw that in these, there are a small frac-
tion of ciphertexts that the simulator cannot decrypt, which
correspond to a set for which the simulator cannot generate
private keys; these identities form the “challenge set”.
In the CHK and BK schemes, the challenge set corre-
sponds to a single identity. The well-formed ciphertexts are
deﬁned to be all ciphertexts that include a valid signature
(or MAC) on the rest of the ciphertext, which the simulator
uses to check that query ciphertexts are well formed. Thus,
the simulator has to arrange for the identity in the challenge
set to match the identity that corresponds to the challenge
it wishes to craft. In both CHK and BK, this is done “exter-
nally” by letting the identity depend on a MAC or signature
key.
In our full encryption scheme, the challenge set of identi-
ties, for which the simulator does not know the private keys,
is larger. Also, rather than being dependent on a MAC or
signature key, the encryption identity is derived from the
ﬁrst two elements of the ciphertext. In our KEM scheme,
we are back to using a challenge set containing a single iden-
tity, but instead of using an external MAC or signature key
to select that identity independently of the adversary in-
put, we simply relax the encryption to a key encapsulation.
In both cases, a well-formed ciphertext is one whose some
of the components (including the one that depends on the
identity) form a Diﬃe-Hellman tuple, which can be easily
checked by the simulator using the bilinear map.
Essentially we are able to take advantage of speciﬁc prop-
erties of the Waters and Boneh-Boyen IBE constructions,
respectively, to test ciphertexts for being well formed with
no additional overhead. However, since we take advantage
of the algebraic properties of the underlying IBE scheme,
without actually constructing a true identity-based cipher-
text, our approach is not generic.
To wrap up, we have summarized in Table 6 a performance
comparison between PK systems and KEMs constructed us-
ing either of the three methods. The table borrows some ﬁg-
ures from Boneh et al. [6], and also includes the Kurosawa-
Desmedt [20] system for reference.

Table 1: Summary of the aspects of the various CCA2-secure PK systems from IBE. When possible, both the
encryption and KEM versions of a scheme are considered simultaneously. The CHK and BK methods are each
instianted with the main and second Boneh-Boyen IBE schemes (BB1 and BB2). The Kurosawa-Desmedt (KD)
KEM/DEM system is also listed for reference; the hybrid symmetric-key ciphertext encryption it incurs should be
excluded for comparison purposes. In determining overheads, the size of any message is discounted to place encryption
and KEM on equal footing.
In counting numbers of operations, exponentiations are allocated optimally between
multi-exponentiations, regular exponentiations, and exponentiations to a ﬁxed base that allows pre-computations. The
allocation preference is based on the following indicative relative timings: bilinear pairing ≈ 2–5, multi-exponentiation ≥
1.5, regular exponentiation = 1, ﬁxed-base exponentiation (cid:28) 0.2.
Boneh and Boyen. Our method takes advantage of special
properties of these systems that we use to improve upon pre-
vious CCA2-secure systems constructed from identity-based
encryption schemes [11, 8]. In particular, our schemes have
advantages in terms of simplicity, ciphertext size, and de-
cryption time, and are well suited for threshold cryptogra-
phy.
