Now that PR #6511 has been merged, self referential parent/child support is
explicitly disabled. Self referential parent/child was never explicitly
supported. It wasn't documented and no tests existed for this parent/child use
case. A long time ago it used to work, but since 0.90 self referential
parent/child has not been working correctly. See #7357.
Right now we need to know what is a parent document and what is a child
document. We do this via the `_type` field. The issue with self referential
parent child is that we use the same type for both parent and child document
and therefore we can't distinguish between parent and child document.
I think we can get around this issue by using the fact if a document has a
`_parent` field instead of the `type` field for identification. I think this
works okay for single level relationships (a parent type and a child type),
but for multi level relationships (a parent type, child type and grandchild
type) I don't think this works out as what is requested in #8100.
