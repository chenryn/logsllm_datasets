With the merge of PR #6511, self-referential parent/child support has been explicitly disabled. It's important to note that this feature was never officially supported, as it was neither documented nor covered by any tests. While it may have functioned in the past, since version 0.90, self-referential parent/child relationships have not been working correctly. For more details, please refer to issue #7357.

Currently, we differentiate between parent and child documents using the `_type` field. The challenge with self-referential parent/child relationships is that both the parent and child documents share the same type, making it impossible to distinguish between them.

One potential solution to address this issue is to identify parent and child documents based on the presence of a `_parent` field, rather than relying solely on the `type` field. This approach could work for single-level relationships (i.e., a parent type and a child type). However, for multi-level relationships (e.g., a parent type, a child type, and a grandchild type), this method may not be sufficient to meet the requirements outlined in issue #8100.
