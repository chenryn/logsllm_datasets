So  come  prepared  with  an  open  mind  and  ready  to 
question and comment on what our panelists present! 
Past NSPW conference panels have dealt with a wide 
variety  of  subjects  including  the  following.  Software 
engineering of secure systems; penetration tolerance; new 
directions  in  cryptography  and  steganography;  alternative 
models  of  trust  and  authorization;  user-centered  security 
for  securing 
and  end-user  defenses;  new  models

The  last  NSPW  panel  was  held  at  ACSAC  2001  and 
was  well  received,  very  lively  and  highly  praised  by  the 
audience, ACSAC organizers and panelists alike. 
Here  are  some  of  the  latest  ideas  to  emerge  from 
NSPW, aside from those you will hear from the rest of the 
panelists.  
•  The  idea  that  defensive  information  warfare  will 
always fail, and that offensive information warfare is 
necessary.  
•  Optimistic  security  as  an  access  control  paradigm, 
where  in  certain  situations  (e.g.,  hospitals)  users  are 
permitted to violate standard access control paradigms 
in the interests of safety.  
•  An  examination  of  the  way  market  forces  may  drive 
the use of protection profiles in the Common Criteria.

enlarging their 
assumptions to include environment and context.  
•  A  case  was  made that  we  must  reconsider  our 
approach to information security from the ground up if 
we  are  to  deal  effectively  with  the  problem  of 
information risk.  
•  A discussion as to the nature and definition of the old 
security paradigms due to the view that it is necessary 
to  define  the  old  paradigms  before  the  novelty  of 
``new''  ones  can  be  considered  with  anything 
approaching scientific rigor.  
•  A new system integrity model that is implementation

This panel highlights a selection of the most interesting 
and  provocative  papers  from  the  2002  New  Security 
Paradigms Workshop. This workshop was held September 
2002 
is 
.  The  panel consists  of  authors  of 
the  selected  papers,  and  the  session  is  moderated  by  the 
workshop’s  general  chairs.  We  present  selected  papers 
focusing on exciting major themes that emerged from the 
workshop. These are the papers that will provoke the most 
interesting discussion at ACSAC. 
Panel Theme 
This  panel  presents  a  selection  of  the  best,  most 
interesting,  and  most  provocative  work  from  the  ACM-
sponsored  New  Security  Paradigms  Workshop  2002.  For 
eleven  years,  the  New  Security  Paradigms  Workshop 
(NSPW) has provided a productive and highly interactive 
forum for innovative new approaches to computer security. 
This  year’s  workshop  brought  a  record  number  of  new 
security  paradigms.  This reflects  the dramatic  increase  of 
interest and research in our field. 
in  order 
NSPW  is  an  invitational  workshop  of  deliberately 
small  size, 
to  facilitate  deep,  meaningful 
discussions  of  new  ideas.  Authors  are  encouraged  to 
present  work  that  might  seem  risky  in  other  settings.  All 
participants  are  charged  with  providing  constructive 
feedback.  The  resulting  brainstorming  environment  has 
proven to be an excellent medium for the furthering of “far 
out” and visionary ideas.  
Our philosophy is to look for significantly new paradigms 
and shifts from previous thinking, and facilitate the debate 
within  a  constructive  environment  of  experienced 
researchers and practitioners along with newer participants 
in  the  field.  In  keeping  with  the  NSPW  philosophy,  this 
panel  challenges  many  of  the  dominant  paradigms  in 
information  security.  You  can  definitely  expect  it  to  be 
highly interactive; in the NSPW tradition, look forward to

•  A new method of downgrading that uses decision trees 
to avoid the inference problem.  
•  A  new  approach  to  helping  applications  defend 
themselves,  while  disarming  hosts  via  the  use  of 
filters.  
•  Since bugs are ubiquitous, a new paradigm called bug 
tolerance  that  enhances  the  survivability  of  flawed 
systems post hoc. 
The  panel  will  consist  of  four  authors  of  papers 
selected by the NSPW 2002 General and Program Chairs, 
and it will be chaired by the general chair. After the panel 
chair’s introductory remarks, each panelist will then give a 
10  to  15  minute  presentation.  The  floor  will  then  be 
opened  for  audience  questions  and  discussions.  This 
format has worked extremely well in the past, and we plan 
to continue the tradition. 
So  come  to  our  panel  and  discover  this  year’s  new 
paradigms! You’ll either immediately like them or dislike 
them - and you’ll get the chance to say so!
