title:botconf2013 A General-purpose Laboratory for Large-scale Botnet Experiments
We will present a general-purpose laboratory for large-scale botnet experiments. We reveal how several key points have been implemented, e.g., realistic simulation of the Internet or total observability within the laboratory. As a case study, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in simulating a large-scale takedown of the Citadel botnet. Additionally, we will show a screencast of the Citadel takedown.
