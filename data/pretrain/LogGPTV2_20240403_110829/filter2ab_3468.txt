**Title: BotConf 2013 - A General-Purpose Laboratory for Large-Scale Botnet Experiments**

In this presentation, we will introduce a general-purpose laboratory designed for conducting large-scale botnet experiments. We will detail the implementation of several key features, such as realistic Internet simulation and comprehensive observability within the laboratory environment.

As a case study, we will demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by simulating a large-scale takedown of the Citadel botnet. Additionally, we will present a screencast showcasing the Citadel takedown process.
