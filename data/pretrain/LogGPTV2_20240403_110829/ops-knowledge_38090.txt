User: I was wondering how to make a python script portable to both linux and windows? 
One problem I see is shebang. How to write the shebang so that the script can be run on both windows and linux?
Are there other problems besides shebang that I should know?
Is the solution same for perl script?
Thanks and regards!
Assistant: The shebang line will be interpreted as a comment by Perl or Python. The only thing that assigns it a special meaning is the UNIX/Linux shell; it gets ignored on Windows. The way Windows knows which interpreter to use to run the file is through the file associations in the registry, a different mechanism altogether.
