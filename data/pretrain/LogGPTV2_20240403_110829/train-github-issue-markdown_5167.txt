##### Description of the problem
@donmccurdy  
glTF 2.0 allows each texture referenced from a material (the textureInfo
structure) to include a `texCoord` value. By default, this is 0 to use the
first UV channel. It looks like three.js doesn't support anything other than 0
here. The value is just ignored so any models using the second UV channel
don't render correctly.
Is this intensional?
