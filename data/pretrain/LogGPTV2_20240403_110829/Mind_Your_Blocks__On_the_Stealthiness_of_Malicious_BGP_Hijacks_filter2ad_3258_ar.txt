such as spam IP blacklists. Moreover, almost none of the IP
address blocks were hijacked more than once meaning that in
this case blacklisting those blocks after the hijack ends is not
particularly useful. Finally, spammers also use the hijacked IP
address blocks as a hosting infrastructure for spam advertised
content.
Finding 5: Spammers mostly hijack IP preﬁxes that have
never been advertised or left unadvertised for a very long time,
typically more than one year.
Finding 6: Hijacking spammers seem to prefer IP address
blocks that were properly registered, in contrast to "bogon"
IP address blocks whose announcements are commonly au-
tomatically ﬁltered out using for instance the list from Team
Cymru [11].
7Disclaimer: IP addresses, domain names and email addresses were found
in campaigns launched from likely hijacked networks only between January
2013 and June 2014. These may have been abused and stolen from their
legitimate owners and, therefore, may now be legitimately used.
Finding 7: Many hijacked IP address blocks we identiﬁed
refer to organisations that ceased to exist. Orphan IP address
blocks that are left behind then become targets of choice

for spammers as they can likely hijack them without being
noticed. As of July 2014 as much as 20.26% of the whole
IPv4 address space8 is currently allocated or assigned but not
publicly announced.
Finding 8: Some short-lived hijacks were clearly associ-
ated with spam activities, conﬁrming the existence of the
BGP hijacking spammers phenomenon as introduced in [35].
However, a large portion of them exhibited no spam and
we conjecture that
they would ideally serve as a moving
infrastructure to host malicious servers.
V. EFFECTIVENESS OF CURRENT
COUNTER-MEASURES
Different technologies and systems have been designed to
detect and mitigate BGP hijacks. In this section we evaluate
the effectiveness of two BGP hijack counter-measures: a state-
of-the-art BGP hijack detection system called Argus [40] and
the BGP security framework RPKI [24], [30], [31].
A. BGP hijack detection
There have been numerous systems [1], [23], [29], [40]
developed to detect and mitigate BGP hijacks. One of them,
Argus [40], aims at detecting BGP hijacks in real-time by
using a combination of BGP data and ping measurements to
detect, upon a routing change related to a network, changes in

the network’s reachability indicating a possible hijack. In an
effort to assess the security impact of the hijack incidents we
uncovered, we decided to verify the effectiveness of the Argus
system against these cases. We chose Argus for two reasons:
(i) it is currently deployed and publicly available, and provides
an historical feed of alerts, and (ii) it is also able to detect all
types of hijacks, namely those where the attacker hijacks an
IP address block by using an invalid BGP origin AS or by
forging part of the BGP AS path.
It turns out that none of the 2,655 hijacks we identiﬁed
were reported by Argus. The reason is that most BGP hijack
detection systems [1], [23], [29], [40] work by building a
model of the Internet AS-level topology and then using it to
validate any routing change. However, because all hijackings
we identiﬁed involve IP space that was unannounced prior to
being hijacked, there is no state for the IP address blocks in the
model resulting in any new route announcement to be accepted
as legitimate. Although current BGP hijack detection tech-
