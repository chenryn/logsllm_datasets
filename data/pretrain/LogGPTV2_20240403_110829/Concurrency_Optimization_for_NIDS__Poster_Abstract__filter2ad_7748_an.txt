Metabolic alterations play an important role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) on both the systemic and central nervous system (CNS) level To study their 
extent and significance in AD, quantitative metabolomics was applied to samples from clinically well-characterized AD patients The association of 
the observed metabolic alterations with core pathological processes of AD was explored to understand their relation with amyloid pathology and 
tau-related neurodegeneration Metabolic profiling, ie untargeted metabolomics and targeted quantification, was performed on paired plasma 
and CSF samples from clinical and biomarker-confirmed AD patients (n=40) and cognitively healthy controls without cerebral AD pathology (n=34) 
Targeted quantification focused on identified deregulated pathways, such as the TCA cycle and its anaplerotic pathways, as well as the neuroactive 
tryptophan pathway Concentrations of several TCA cycle and beta-oxidation intermediates were higher in plasma of AD patients, whilst amino 
acid concentrations were significantly lower Similar alterations were observed in CSF, which were strongly correlated with blood-brain barrier 
permeability Alterations of several amino acids in CSF were associated with CSF Amyloidβ1–42 The tryptophan catabolites kynurenic acid and 
quinolinic acid showed significantly higher concentrations in CSF of AD patients, which, together with other tryptophan pathway intermediates, 
were correlated with either CSF Amyloidβ1–42, or tau and phosphorylated Tau-181 These results revealed AD-associated systemic dysregulation 
of nutrient sensing and oxidation and CNS-specific alterations in the neuroactive tryptophan pathway The specific association of amino acids and 
tryptophan catabolites with AD CSF biomarkers suggests a close relationship with core AD pathology

Exudative Age-related Macular Degeneration, which is characterized by a choroidal neovascularization (CNV), is the leading cause of blindness 
among the elderly population in developed countries Treatment is based on intra-vitreal injection of anti-VEGF Nevertheless, the comprehensive 
understanding of the pathogenesis and the evolution of this multi-factorial disease remain incomplete Moreover, due to the long-term disease 
chronicity and resistance to treatment, the continuous follow-up of patients, the personalization of treatment and the discovery of new therapeutic 
approaches are mandatory Because metabolomics provides a unique and direct vision to pathologies and/or treatment administration, this 
approach seems particularly adapted to study CNV occurrence and evolution, and to get novel and innovative insights into AMD We applied a 
NMR-based metabolomics approach on sera coming from both clinical (AMD patients and controls) and pre-clinical model (a murine model that 
mimics CNV development) In the human cohort but also in the mice model, lactate and lipoproteins profile emerge as the main key metabolites and 
could be correlated to the AMD active phase and CNV development Pharmacological normalization of lactate levels in the mice model by blocking 
pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) or anti-VEGF treatments inhibits CNV formation and modified lipoproteins profiles Mechanistically, we 
explore the role of lactate and we studied the modification of lipoproteins profiles according to CNV development Altogether, we demonstrate that 
metabolomics is a suitable tool to deep insight into AMD and to identify some metabolites as functional, traceable and targetable molecules that 
open new perspectives for optimizing and personalizing treatment and patient follow-up

Effect of calorie restriction on metabolic phenotypes of intestinal tissues in an aging model
PRESENTING AUTHOR: So Young Lim, Chonnam National University, South Korea
CO-AUTHORS: Young-Shick Hong
Aging accompanies the degeneration of intestinal metabolism and this intestinal dysfunction causes adverse effects to the host metabolism Calorie 
restriction (CR) is an effective intervention to delay aging However, the modification of intestinal metabolites by CR in aged model has been poorly 
understood Therefore, we investigated the metabolic effect of 40% CR in various intestinal tissues and feces in an aged rat model, through 1H 
NMR-based metabolomics approach The levels of fecal acetate in CR mice were significantly increased compared to control mice, indicating the 
alteration of the gut microbiota composition under CR condition Moreover, the metabolic perturbation associated with nucleotide metabolism, 
osmoregulation, oxidative stress and bile acid metabolism were observed in the intestinal tissues of CR mice Taken together, these metabolic 
features demonstrate that CR contributes to improvement of intestinal dysfunction caused by aging

A Single Tissue Section Analysis Using Desi-msi and Laser Capture Microdissection for a Multimodal Cancer Research
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Emine Kazanc, Imperial College of London, United Kingdom
Using clinical specimens for multiple approaches including desorption electrospray ionisation (DESI-MSI) with transcriptomic can be challenging 
Downstream analysis needs more adjacent sections Therefore, a multimodal approach in same slide would allow to co-register different types of 
information providing a comprehensive knowledge about molecular characterising of diseases in particularly cancer The envisioned combination 
analysis raises special requirements including short DESI-MSI run time to prevent RNA degradation during analysis in room temperature The 
isolated RNA must have sufficient quality to carry out qPCR, RNA seq for transcriptomics Clinical samples were obtained from Imperial College 
Tissue Bank  Tissues from patient with ovarian cancer were cryosectioned at 10 µm The DESI-MSI spectrum was collected from sections and same 
sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin in RNase free conditions Next, the regions of interest in the same slide were microdissected 
by Laser Capture Microdissection (Leica 7000) and RNA was isolated RNA quality control was done by the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer for qPCR and 
Sequencing Preliminary results showed that the RNA amount is slightly less in DESI-MSI analysed slides than non-analysed slides Having less RNA 
from the DESI-MSI analysed of samples can be attributed to different reasons including analysis at room temperature causing RNA degradation The 
RNA degradation of each sample was evaluated measuring the RNA Integrity Number (RIN) The results of Agilent showed that the RNA quality of 
samples was sufficiently good to carry out downstream analysis to identify specific genes expression, which are related with the identified metabolic 
profiling by DESI-MSI

Adipocyte-induced metabolic changes in HER2-positive cancer cells: understanding breast cancer resistance  
to targeted therapies
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Manhal Mili, Institute of Analytical Sciences, France
Targeted therapies have revolutionized the management of HER2-positive breast cancer, a particularly invasive form of cancer that responds poorly 
to conventional chemotherapy However, resistance to treatment occurs in 25-60% of patients, presenting a new therapeutic challenge Adipocytes 
were previously shown to act on HER2+ cells to decrease their sensitivity to targeted therapy (monoclonal antibody trastuzumab) in co-culture 
Addition of a lipolysis stimulator (isoprenaline, a beta-adrenoreceptor agonist) to the system led to further decrease of HER2+ cancer cells response 
to trastuzumab while conversely, addition of a lipolysis inhibitor (beta-blocker propranolol) rescued the response to therapy In order to understand 
the underlying mechanisms of adipocyte-modulated cancer cells resistance to trastuzumab, we present here a detailed pharmaco-metabolomic 
investigation of adipocyte and HER2+ cancer cell co-cultures and associated controls, conducted with or without addition of propranolol 
and isoprenaline 1H 800 MHz NMR profiles were recorded to quantify metabolites present in the co-cultures supernatants and to assess the 
respective endometabolomes of adipocytes and HER2+ cancer cells Quantitative analysis of HER2+ cell fingerprints (41 quantified metabolites) 
demonstrates substantial variations of metabolite concentrations in the presence of propranolol or isoprenaline, notably succinate and glycerol 
We show that propranolol and isoprenaline, in addition to their impact on lipolysis, induced changes in adipocytes in the concentrations of UDP-
glucose, 1-methylnicotinamide and several amino-acids These results hint at a broad impact of adipocytes on HER2+ cell metabolism Overall, our 
metabolomics investigation provides new insights into the mechanisms by which pharmacological modulation of lipolysis via beta-adrenoreceptors 
impact on HER2+ cancer cell metabolism

Introduction: The standard treatment for head and neck cancer (HNSCC) is radio-/chemoradiotherapy (RT/CHRT) However, it is associated with 
significant temporary or permanent toxic side effects in normal tissue and/or involved regions (acute radiation sequelae, ARS) In this study we 
investigated the real-time dynamic changes in serum metabolome during RT/CHRT in HNSCC patients to identify biomarkers of early ARS and to 
find their association with selected genetic variants affecting anticancer treatment response Methods: The studied group consisted of 220 patients 
(22–80 years) treated with radical intent for hypopharynx, larynx, nasopharynx and oropharynx cancers Blood serum samples were collected 
weekly from the day before the treatment till the RT/CHRT completion 1H NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker 40013MHz spectrometer 
(NOESY, CPMG, diffusion edited and J-resolved sequences) Genetic polymorphisms were detected by PCR-RFLP or TaqMan probes The data 
were analyzed using SIMCA (principal component analysis, partial least squares – discriminant analysis) and STATISTICA software Results: We 
identified a group of outlying patients with a massive increase of signals arising from the ketone bodies (3-hydroxybutyrate, acetone, acetoacetate) 
Such increase correlated with the episodes of severe functional and morphological ARS Furthermore, the NBS1 and GSTM1 polymorphisms 
were significantly associated with different disturbances in the serum metabolome and ARS severity (via the impact on energy metabolism and 
inflammation) Conclusions: Real-time molecular monitoring during RT/CHRT could be beneficial for early detection of patients with poor treatment 
tolerance This work was supported by the National Science Centre (NCN), Poland, grants no 2016/23/B/NZ5/03470 and 2015/17/B/NZ5/01387

Biomarkers for prostate cancer (PCa) recurrence are highly needed for better management and follow-up of radiotherapy patients Up-regulation 
of TOP2A and EZH2 have previously been connected to a more aggressive disease in radical prostatectomy (RP) patients Further, low tissue 
levels of the metabolites citrate and spermine have been associated with biochemical recurrence (BCR, PSA≥02 ng/ml) in RP patients The main 
aim of the present study was to investigate the potential of gene expression and MR tissue metabolites as biomarkers for BCR in transrectal 
ultrasound-guided (TRUS) biopsies of PCa radiotherapy patients prior to treatment (n=172 samples) TOP2A and EZH2 expression were assessed 
using immunohistochemistry, and high-resolution magic angle spinning MR spectroscopy was performed to measure metabolites in the same TRUS 
biopsy In cancer patient samples without hormone treatment, concurrent up-regulation of TOP2A and EZH2 were identified as predictors of BCR 
among PCa radiotherapy patients (n=31, p=00079) Lower levels of citrate (p=00037) and polyamines (p=00057) prove the same TOP2A and 
EZH2 in combination with significantly lower levels of either citrate or polyamines in cancer samples was confirmed as potential biomarkers for BCR 
among radiotherapy patients in TRUS biopsies collected prior to treatment (n=6, p=000027, p<00001 respectively) In conclusion, combination 
of TOP2A and EZH2, MR metabolites citrate and polyamines are suggested as biomarkers for BCR in PCa radiotherapy patients not receiving 
neoadjuvant hormonal treatment measured in TRUS biopsies prior to treatment; however, this needs validation in a larger cohort This study offers a 
translational potential detecting metabolites using in vivo MR spectroscopic imaging

PRESENTING AUTHOR: Eleonora Amante, Università degli Studi di Torino, Italy
CO-AUTHORS: Alessandra Biancolillo, Rasmus Bro, Francesco Porpiglia, Alberto Salomone, Marco Vincenti
Prostate carcinoma is the principal cause of cancer-related death in men The prostate specific antigen (PSA) dosage is, at the present, the unique 
clinical test available to screen for this pathology PSA is highly sensitive but not enough specific for malignancy, providing a significant amount 
of misleading results Thus, new biomarkers which could improve the diagnostic power of prostate screenings are needed The present work is a 
preliminary study aimed to discover new urinary biomarkers suitable for this purpose Ninety subjects, divided into controls and prostate carcinoma-
affected, were recruited Two aliquots of each sample were treated as follows: proteins were precipitated, two subsequent extractions (at acid and 
basic conditions) were performed for each aliquot and the dried extracts were derivatized using trifluoroacetic anhydride (aliquot A) and trimethylsilyl 
derivatizing mixture (aliquot B) The full-SCAN GC-MS spectra (two for each sample) were then processed with the following chemometric approach: (i) 
the alignment was performed by double warping algorithm; (ii) The spectral deconvolution was carried out using the PARADISe software, based on the 
PARAFAC2 algorithm; (iii) The semiquantitative report provided by the software was then subjected to two different and independent variable selection 
procedures: (a) Variable Importance Projection and (b) Covariance Selection algorithm; (iv) The reduced datasets were used to build two classification 
models, which performances were compared The validation of the models was performed using a repeated double cross validation approach, and the 
obtained preliminary results are promising, scoring near to 90% for both specificity and sensitivity

Background: Metabolomic profiles reflect the combined influence of genetic and lifestyle factors in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC) 
To date, few prospective studies have conducted metabolome-wide association analyses of pre-diagnostic plasma in CRC risk Methods: We 
conducted a nested case-control study among 32,786 women (Nurses’ Health Study [NHS]) and 18,159 men (Health Professionals Follow-
up Study [HPFS]) who provided blood (~60% fasting) between 1989-95 Over a 17-year follow-up period, we documented 665 (409 in NHS, 
256 in HPFS) incident CRC cases which were matched 1:1 to 665 controls based on cohort, age, race, time of collection, and fasting status 
We conducted metabolomic profiling using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify 530 known plasma metabolites Weighted 
correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was done to obtain modules of interconnected molecules with high topological overlap Logistic 
regression was used for association analyses, and multiple comparisons correction was performed using α-threshold P<85x10-4 Results: We 
observed significant associations with CRC risk for 5 metabolites, including C58:7-TAG (OR=081,P=66x10-4) in all participants, myristoleic acid 
(OR=132,P=43x10-4) in women, and N2,N2-dimethylguanosine (OR=161,P=48x10-4) in men Associations were stronger when restricted to 
fasting samples Among WGCNA-derived modules, association differed according to sex, with nucleic acid module associated with CRC in men 
(P=0010), and carnitine module associated in all participants (P=0013) Conclusions: We identified prediagnostic metabolites associated with CRC 
in 3 groups, acylglcyerols, purines, and ω-5-fatty acids, with distinct profiles in men compared with women These results provide insight into the 
etiopathogenesis of CRC and have implications for risk prediction and novel prevention strategies

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common malignancy in men Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is the most frequently used biomarker for PCa 
screening but, due to its recognized limitations, nowadays, US Preventive Services Task Force recommends against PSA screening The analysis 
of volatile compounds emanating from biological samples is a major promising approach for finding new effective diagnostic markers for PCa The 
purpose of this work was to study the urinary volatile metabolic profile of patients with PCa (n=40) and non-cancer controls (n=42) with the aim of 
identifying a potential urinary volatile pattern as a non-invasive strategy to detect PCa A metabolomics approach based on headspace solid-phase 
microextraction gas chromatography–mass spectrometry was performed to investigate volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in general and, more 
specifically, volatile carbonyl compounds (VCCs) present in urine samples Considering both approaches, a panel of 30 volatile compounds descriptive 
of PCa was defined, capable of discriminating PCa patients from controls Furthermore, an external validation set (n=18 PCa and n=18 non-cancer 
controls) was used to calculate the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the defined panel Our results revealed that this panel of 30-volatiles was able 
to perfectly predict PCa, with 100% sensitivity, specificity and accuracy Overall, our results disclose a biomarker panel that has the potential to be used 
in clinic for PCa diagnosis ARL thanks FCT, Portugal, for her PhD grant (SFRH/BD/123012/2016) This work was financed by national funds from FCT/

CO-AUTHORS: Andriy Derkach, Steve Moore, Stephanie Weinstein, Demetrius Albanes, Joshua Sampson
Background: Metabolomics profiles may offer improved insights into etiology and the system of factors involved in the process of pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumorigenesis Methods: We conducted an untargeted analysis of 554 known metabolites measured in pre-diagnostic 
serum (up to 24 years) to determine their association with incident PDAC in a nested-case control study of male smokers (373 matched case-
control sets) with replication in an independent nested-case control study in that included women and non-smokers (107 matched sets) Controls 
were matched to cases by age, sex, race, date of blood draw and follow-up time We used conditional logistic regression to calculate odds ratios 
(OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for a 1 standard deviation increase in log-metabolite level separately in each cohort and combined the 
two ORs using a fixed effects meta-analysis Results: Thirty-one metabolites were significantly associated with PDAC at an FDR < 005 with 12 
metabolites below the Bonferroni-corrected threshold (P-value < 904 x 10-5) Similar associations were observed in both cohorts The dipeptides 
glycylvaline, aspartylphenylalanine, pyroglutamylglycine, phenylalanylphenylalanine, phenylalanylleucine, and tryptophylglutamate and amino 
acids aspartate and glutamate were positively while the dipeptides tyrosylglutamine and α-glutamyltyrosine, fibrinogen cleavage peptide 
DSGEGDFXAEGGGVR, and glutathione related amino acid cysteine-glutathione disulfide were inversely associated with PDAC after Bonferroni 
correction Five top metabolites demonstrated significant time varying associations (P-value < 0023) with associations becoming attenuated 10-15 
years after participants’ blood collection Conclusion: Our results demonstrate pre-diagnostic metabolites related to subclinical disease, glutathione 
metabolism, and adiposity/insulin resistance are associated with PDAC

A key metabolic alteration in tumour cells is increased dependency on glycolysis, resulting in the production of lactate which is transported out of 
cells by monocarboxylate transporters (MCT1 & MCT4) which are therefore a therapeutic target in cancer Current literature suggests that inhibition 
of MCT1 in preclinical models can constrain cancer cell growth in tumours with low MCT4 expression To date the systemic pharmacodynamic effects 
of the small-molecule non-competitive inhibitor of MCT1, AZD3965, the agent of study in this first-in-class (FIC) trial CRUKD12/004, have not been 
fully characterised Preclinical metabolomics studies conducted at Imperial College London indicated that AZD3965 exposure caused increases 
in lactate, ketone bodies (also MCT1 substrates) and citrate in blood plasma and urine independently of tumour burden and tumour expression of 
MCT1, and also caused decreases in fatty acids in blood plasma We used NMR spectroscopy of urine and plasma samples from 34 patients from 
the trial to specifically monitor lactate and other ketone bodies and in addition a metabolomics screen using a well-validated LC-MS/MS protocol 
(Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ p180 kit) on plasma Metabolomics profile of plasma and urine appears to reflect response of AZD3965 treatment, and 
especially total urinary excretion of lactate and ketone bodies offers proof of target engagement This effect is not mirrored in plasma suggesting 
that this may be primarily a renal effect Observed systemic metabolic effects of AZD3965 exposure appear to lessen with repeated dosing, 
suggesting a rapid adaptive response Metabolomics profile can offer insides in understanding the mechanism of drug toxicity

Up to 50% of prostate cancer surgical patients will suffer from biochemical recurrence manifested by detectable serum prostate specific antigen 
levels even after prostate removal Relatively limited pre-operative information has not yielded adequate prognosis to guide a patient’s treatment 
decision More clinical data is needed to improve prognosis New biomarkers can arise from metabolome analysis of patient serum to aid physicians 
and patients in developing a treatment plan We applied a multiplatform (NMR + LC−MS) metabolomics approach to the study of preoperative 
metabolic alterations associated with prostate cancer recurrence Correlation analysis on the serum metabolite abundances from prostate cancer 
patients (n = 40 remission vs n = 40 recurrence) showed significant alterations in several pathways, including amino acid metabolism, purine and 
pyrimidine synthesis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, tryptophan catabolism, glucose, and lactate In addition, higher lipid abundances were observed 
in the serum from recurrent patients for several classes that included triglycerides, lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, 
phosphatidylinositols, diglycerides, acyl carnitines, and ceramides Machine learning approaches led to the selection of a 20-metabolite panel from 
a single preoperative blood sample that enabled prediction of recurrence with 926% accuracy, 944% sensitivity, and 919% specificity under cross-
validation conditions
