User: Please introduce the main threats and defense measures of Web application security.
Assistant: The main threats to web application security include the following categories: 1. SQL injection attacks: Attackers use vulnerabilities to embed malicious scripts in applications to obtain or tamper with sensitive data in the database. 2. Cross-site scripting attack (XSS): The attacker obtains sensitive information of the user (such as the session ID in the cookie) by inserting malicious scripts into the web page, and sends it to the attacker. 3. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack: The attacker forges the request and deceives the user to access to realize the attack. 4. File upload attack: An attacker uploads a file containing a malicious script, regards it as a legitimate file on the website, and then uses the script to attack the website, resulting in data leakage or system crash. In order to prevent the above attacks, the following defensive measures can be taken: 1. Use flexible input filtering and verification mechanisms to avoid SQL injection attacks. 2. Use HTTP Only cookies to avoid cross-site scripting attacks. 3. Implement authentication and authorization schemes, use SLO (Single Logout) and other facilities to avoid cross-site request forgery attacks. 4. Adopt a safe file upload method, and avoid file upload attacks by configuring file extension, mime type, size, and content type restrictions.
