I installed Superset 2.0.0 via pip. I get the following error when running
`superset` after installation:
    $ superset
    ...
    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'werkzeug.wrappers.etag'
#### How to reproduce the bug
I installed Superset via pip in a clean Python 3.8 virtual environment on
Linux:
    $ mkdir superset-2.0.0
    $ cd superset-2.0.0
    $ python3.8 -m venv venv
    $ source ./venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install --upgrade setuptools pip wheel
    $ pip install apache-superset==2.0.0
    $ pip install pillow mysqlclient gevent
    $ vim superset_config.py
    $ export PYTHONPATH=/home/superset/superset-2.0.0
    $ export FLASK_APP=superset
    $ superset
    ...
    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'werkzeug.wrappers.etag'
### Expected results
Superset runs without error.
### Actual results
Superset crashes with Python `ModuleNotFoundError`.
### Environment
  * superset version: Superset 2.0.0
  * python version: Python 3.8.10
### Checklist
Make sure to follow these steps before submitting your issue - thank you!
  * I have checked the superset logs for python stacktraces and included it here as text if there are any.
  * I have reproduced the issue with at least the latest released version of superset.
  * I have checked the issue tracker for the same issue and I haven't found one similar.
### Additional Information
I notice that `requirements/base.txt` lists `werkzeug==2.0.3` so I installed
that manually and superset runs fine after.
