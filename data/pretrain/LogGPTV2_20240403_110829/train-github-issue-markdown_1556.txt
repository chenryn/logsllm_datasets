Hello,  
I'm new trying the PowerToys. For now it works just fine.  
I only have a sugestion about the contextual menu icon. I'm not sure if this
request was made already, so here we go.  
On the dark theme, the icon for PowerRename contextual menu is no clearly
visible, as it is black, over a dark background. So I thought that you maybe
can make it white, or some brighter color (like the Share icon).
