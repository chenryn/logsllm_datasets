Subject: Suggestion for Improving Visibility of PowerRename Icon in Dark Theme

Hello,

I am a new user of PowerToys and, so far, I have found it to be working well. However, I would like to provide some feedback regarding the contextual menu icon.

In the dark theme, the PowerRename icon is not easily visible as it is black and blends into the dark background. To improve visibility, I suggest changing the icon color to white or another brighter color, similar to the Share icon.

Please see the attached screenshot for reference:

Thank you for considering my suggestion.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
