### Describe the issue:
I'm still not able to generate man page as I've reported that in #20229
however recently I've changed methodology of generate man pages from using
sphinx<>setuptools integration (`python setup.py build_sphinx`) to straight
use `sphinx-buid` command. All because already sphinx<>setuptools is marked as
deprecated.  
As part of that change I've started using `sphinx-build -n` switch.  
Sphinx still is not able to generate man page however before it crashes it
shows many warnings which are mot related to generate man page.  
Here is the output
You can peak on fixes that kind of issues in other projects

    `/usr/bin/sphinx-build -n -T -b man doc/source build/sphinx/man`
### Error message:
_No response_
