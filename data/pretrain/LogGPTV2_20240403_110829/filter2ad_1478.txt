Abstract
Compiler and architectural techniques can play a
vital role in dependability enhancement of applica(cid:173)
tions. These techniques have traditionally been fo(cid:173)
cused on performance enhancement. However this
trend is changing as reliability and security are be(cid:173)
coming first-class constraints for application design.
The goal ofthe workshop is to provide a common plat-
form for researchers in the dependability community
to interact with researchers in the compiler and com(cid:173)
puter architecture communities so that effective cross(cid:173)
pollination ofideas can occur between these areas.

Themes, Goal and Objectives
As computer systems grow more and more com(cid:173)
plex, it becomes harder to ensure that they operate in a
reliable and secure fashion. The problem is especially
severe at the application-level, due to the diversity of
software platforms and the ever-increasing demand for
adding new features in applications. Manual addition
of ad-hoc techniques to ensure application fault and
attack tolerance may be error-prone and runs the risk
of missing important reliability loopholes and security
vulnerabilities. This in tum can lead to catastrophic
failures and devastating attacks. Compiler and archi(cid:173)
tectural techniques can playa crucial role in automat(cid:173)
ing both detection of and recovery from errors and
attacks in applications.
The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum
for researchers in the dependability and security com(cid:173)
munities to interact with compiler designers and com(cid:173)
puter architects, so that effective cross-pollination of
ideas can occur between these areas. Further,
the
workshop will stress on the importance of designing
for reliability and security in the computer architecture
and compiler communIties, where traditionally the
emphasis has been on performance enhancement.
The objectives that we plan to achieve during the
workshop are as follows:
•
Define core dependability issues that can be effec(cid:173)
tively addressed in the compiler and architecture
community in order to improve the resilience of
applications. For example, "How do we imple(cid:173)
ment compiler transformations that are safe in the
presence of transient and permanent hardware er(cid:173)
rors?" or "How do we ensure that microproces(cid:173)
sors provide transparent error containment and re(cid:173)
covery to applications?"
Discuss how we can leverage the latest advances
in computer architecture (such as multi-core plat(cid:173)
forms, reconfigurable computing) and in compiler
technology (such as dynamic code generation,
proof-carrying code transformations) to improve
the dependability of applications.
Identify means for evaluating compiler and archi(cid:173)
tectural techniques in terms of their costs and the
dependability benefits they provide to applica(cid:173)
tions in order to come up with a "ready reckoner"
for engineers who wish to deploy such techniques.

3 Organizational Details
3.1
Submission Information
Regular contributions will be 5-6 pages in length and
will be refereed both on the basis of novelty of the
idea as well as their technical content.
In addition to
regular papers, we also encourage position papers and
work-in-progress reports. These will be refereed based
on the novelty of the idea and the ability to generate
discussion at the workshop.
3.2 Workshop Format
The workshop will consist of a day-long series of
presentations followed by a panel discussion. We will
have sessions featuring both regular papers and short
papers (position papers or work-in-progress reports).
Each regular paper will be given 20 minutes for pres(cid:173)
entation at the workshop (including questions). Short
paper authors will be given 5 minutes to present their
idea at the conference, and may optionally present
their work as posters.
The panel will feature industry experts in depend(cid:173)
able and secure computing. We will solicit their views
on what needs to be done by compiler and architecture
researchers to advance the state of art in dependable
and secure computing.
