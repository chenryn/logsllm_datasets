User: Please introduce common distributed cache systems, as well as the different characteristics and applicable scenarios of each system.
Assistant: Common distributed cache systems include: 1. Redis: supports a variety of data structures, and is particularly good at being used as a cache. Supports replication and persistence, suitable for highly concurrent read and write scenarios and fast access to data. Due to the support of rich data structures, it can also be used in other data processing fields. 2. Memcached: Open source, high-performance caching system, mainly suitable for scenarios with high read and write performance requirements. Supports multi-threading, multi-process, memory and network I/O separation, so it can handle higher concurrent requests. Does not support the persistence function and is usually used in hot data caching scenarios. 3. Hazelcast: supports multiple data structures and provides client libraries for multiple programming languages. Support data partition and copy, suitable for high availability and distributed deployment scenarios. It can store a large amount of data and handle a large number of concurrent requests. 4. Apache Ignite: A memory-optimized distributed database that can also be used as a caching system. Supports persistence, distributed deployment, multiple data structures and queries. It is suitable for high-concurrency transactions and big data processing scenarios. 5. Couchbase: It can be used as both a cache system and a distributed database. Supports fast reading and writing, multiple data structures, data partitioning and persistence. It is suitable for processing a large number of concurrent requests and storing data on a large scale. Different cache systems have different characteristics and applicable scenarios. Redis is a powerful caching system that supports multiple data structures and persistence, and is suitable for highly concurrent read and write scenarios and fast access to data. Memcached is more suitable for situations that require high read and write performance, and does not support the persistence function. Hazelcast can store a large amount of data and handle a large number of concurrent requests, suitable for high-availability distributed scenarios. Apache Ignite is suitable for high-concurrency transactions and big data processing scenarios, and can be used as a cache system or a distributed database. Couchbase can be used as both a cache system and a distributed database, suitable for storing large-scale data and processing a large number of concurrent requests.
