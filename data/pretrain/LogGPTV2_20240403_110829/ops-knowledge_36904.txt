User: I have this line in my bat file:
C:\Python26\python.exe C:\myPythonDirectory.py
But it fails giving the error: can't open file [Errno2] no such file or directory.
Could it be giving an error because there is a space in one of the folder names in my python directory?
Assistant: Absolutely.  If there's a space in the path, you need to put the whole path in double quotes.
