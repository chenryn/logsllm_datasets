User: is snmp really required to manage devices ?
i'd like to script something with python to manage devices (mainly  servers), such as disk usage, process list etc.
i'm learning how to do and many article speak about snmp protocole.
I can't use, for example, psutil, or subprocess or os modules, and send information via udp ?
Thanks a lot
Assistant: No, it's not required, but your question is sort of like asking if you're required to use http to serve web pages.  Technically you don't need it, but if you don't use it you're giving up interoperability with a lot of existing client software.
