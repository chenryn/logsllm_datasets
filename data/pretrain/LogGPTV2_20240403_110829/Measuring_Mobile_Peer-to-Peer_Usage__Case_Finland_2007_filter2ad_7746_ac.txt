P2P
The distributions of web and email traffic clearly reflect patterns of human behav-
ior,  i.e.  high  activity  throughout  waking  hours  and  dramatically  decreasing  usage  
during the night. Moreover, the use of some applications (e.g. email) concentrates on 
office  hours during the  working days,  whereas others (e.g.  web browsing) are  more 
free-time  oriented.  On  the  contrary,  both  P2P  and  unidentified  traffic  follow  very 
similar patterns through the week, and the peak hours for both traffic types occur dur-
ing the night.

Typically  in  fixed  access  networks  P2P  traffic  is  uniformly  distributed  over  the 
whole  day  [1],  as  large  media  files  get  downloaded  at  the  limit  of  available  capacity 
without  the  need  for  any  human  input.  In  mobile  networks,  phone  calls  and  non-P2P 
data usage consume most of the network capacity during the day, but the remaining ca-
pacity  is  consumed  by  P2P  applications  during  the  night.  Further  investigation  of  the 
traffic traces shows  that the share of  uplink traffic  for P2P traffic (58%)  is similar to 
unidentified  traffic  (52%),  and  significantly  higher  than  for  other  applications  (e.g. 
email: 32%, web: 13%). All this suggests that the true share of P2P traffic in the mobile 
network is considerably higher than the level proposed by pure port based identification. 
A breakdown of P2P traffic by protocol is presented in Fig. 4. BitTorrent displays a 
growing trend; Direct Connect, Gnutella and Napster exhibit a decreasing trend; and 
eDonkey shows variation. However, as unidentified traffic potentially consists mostly 
of P2P traffic, the protocol profile is a result of the identification method, not of the 
true usage. In other words, the portion of traffic using non-standard port numbers is 
unidentified, therefore potentially biasing the distributions significantly.

4.2   Handset Monitoring Results 
In the panel study, three major categories of P2P applications are found: Voice over 
IP  (VoIP)  clients,  instant  messaging,  and  file  sharing.  Most  of  the  identified  P2P  
applications receive very little usage, typically having only a few users, which rarely 
activate the P2P application on a regular basis (see Table 2). Clearly MP2P applica-
tions  are  not  popular.  The  average  number  of  usage  sessions  per  month  per  user  is 
relatively high. The usage session is defined to consist of minimum 15 seconds from 
the activation of the application until its closure. 
Table 3 presents the results of the data volume analysis in both GSM/UMTS and 
WLAN. MP2P applications experience very little actual usage. According to the re-
sults, people probably only experiment with MP2P applications. Only Fring exhibits 
wider usage, typically generating 4% of the total packet data volume of its users. On 
average Fring generates 1 MB per month per user. 12% of Fring traffic takes place on 
GSM networks (10% in EDGE and 2% in GPRS networks), and the share of UMTS 
networks is 16%. The share of WLAN traffic in Fring usage is 72%, possibly indicat-
ing cost avoidance behavior.

5   Conclusions 
In the traffic trace measurement, we observe almost zero P2P file sharing traffic for 
handsets, but 9-18% of unidentified traffic, part of which possibly being P2P traffic. 
A growing trend for computer-based P2P file sharing traffic is visible in GSM/UMTS 
networks, BitTorrent and eDonkey being the most popular protocols. Again, a signifi-
cant growing portion (10-58%) of traffic is left unidentified by our port number based 
identification method, potentially suggesting a noticeable increase of P2P traffic using 
random port numbers. Diurnal analysis of the traffic partially confirms this behavior. 
Only Fring, a client to several P2P-based communication services, has significant us-
age and data volume levels in the panel study. 
Relative P2P traffic growth and changes in P2P protocol distributions in our traffic 
trace measurements is dependent on global P2P trends. For instance, some of the studies 
discussed earlier depicted a coherent trend of growth in BitTorrent usage which is also 
visible in our study. The other trend seen in our study common to other studies is the 
relative growth of unidentified traffic potentially consisting of masqueraded P2P traffic. 
The absolute traffic growth is probably explained by the following significant changes 
in the Finnish mobile market: the active marketing of flat rate data tariffs in 2006 and 
USB data modems in 2007 to the consumer market by major mobile operators. 
In the panel study, many kinds of metrics on service usage can be derived straight 
from the device. The shortcomings of the panel study include the adverse selection of 
panelists and the amount of data available. If the dataset contained more P2P data ses-
sions, the data traffic patterns could be studied in detail, including the distinction be-
tween WLAN and cellular P2P use. 
Further  research  could  include  applying  more  advanced  P2P  traffic  identification 
methods  to  traffic  trace  measurements,  such  as  Domain  Name  Server  (DNS)  based 
analysis  and  detection  according  to  statistical  identification  functions.  The  more

advanced methods could facilitate the detection of other types of P2P protocols than 
file  sharing  using  random  port  numbers,  for  instance  Skype  [26].  While  applying 
these methods, the potential peculiarities posed by the GSM/UMTS and WLAN net-
works, such as longer access delays, should be taken into consideration. The panel re-
sults could be refined by having a more precise approach to MP2P application identi-
fication  and  by  analyzing  possible  correlations  between  respondents’  demographics 
and usage profiles.
