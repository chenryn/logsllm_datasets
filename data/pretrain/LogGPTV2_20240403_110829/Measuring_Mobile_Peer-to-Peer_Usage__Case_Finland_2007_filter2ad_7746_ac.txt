### Email, Web, and P2P Traffic Patterns

The distribution of web and email traffic clearly reflects patterns of human behavior, characterized by high activity during waking hours and a significant decrease in usage during the night. Additionally, the use of some applications, such as email, is concentrated during office hours on working days, while others, like web browsing, are more oriented towards free time. In contrast, both P2P and unidentified traffic exhibit similar patterns throughout the week, with peak usage occurring during the night.

### Measuring Mobile Peer-to-Peer Usage: Case Finland 2007

In fixed access networks, P2P traffic is typically uniformly distributed over the entire day, as large media files are downloaded at the maximum available capacity without requiring human input. In mobile networks, phone calls and non-P2P data usage consume most of the network capacity during the day, but the remaining capacity is utilized by P2P applications at night. Further analysis of traffic traces reveals that the share of uplink traffic for P2P (58%) is similar to that of unidentified traffic (52%), and significantly higher than for other applications (e.g., email: 32%, web: 13%). This suggests that the true share of P2P traffic in mobile networks is considerably higher than what is indicated by port-based identification methods.

A breakdown of P2P traffic by protocol is shown in Figure 4. BitTorrent shows a growing trend, while Direct Connect, Gnutella, and Napster exhibit a decreasing trend. eDonkey displays variability. However, since unidentified traffic potentially consists mostly of P2.P traffic, the protocol profile is a result of the identification method rather than actual usage. In other words, traffic using non-standard port numbers remains unidentified, which may significantly bias the distributions.

| **Protocol** | **2005** | **2006** | **2007** |
|--------------|----------|----------|----------|
| BitTorrent   | 51%      | 27%      | 14%      |
| Direct Connect | 14%    | 0%       | 0%       |
| eDonkey     | 65%      | 38%      | 37%      |

| Napster     | 0%       | 0%       | 9%       |

### Handset Monitoring Results

In the panel study, three major categories of P2P applications were identified: Voice over IP (VoIP) clients, instant messaging, and file sharing. Most of the identified P2P applications received very little usage, typically having only a few users who rarely activated the P2P application regularly (see Table 2). Clearly, mobile P2P (MP2P) applications are not popular. The average number of usage sessions per month per user is relatively high, defined as a minimum of 15 seconds from the activation of the application until its closure.

### Conclusions

In the traffic trace measurements, we observed almost zero P2P file-sharing traffic for handsets, but 9-18% of unidentified traffic, part of which is likely P2P. A growing trend for computer-based P2P file-sharing traffic is visible in GSM/UMTS networks, with BitTorrent and eDonkey being the most popular protocols. A significant portion (10-58%) of traffic remains unidentified, suggesting an increase in P2P traffic using random port numbers. Diurnal analysis of the traffic partially confirms this behavior. Only Fring, a client for several P2P-based communication services, has significant usage and data volume levels in the panel study.

The relative growth and changes in P2P protocol distributions in our traffic trace measurements are dependent on global P2P trends. For example, the growth in BitTorrent usage, as seen in other studies, is also evident in our study. The other common trend is the relative growth of unidentified traffic, potentially consisting of masqueraded P2P traffic. The absolute traffic growth can be attributed to significant changes in the Finnish mobile market, such as the active marketing of flat-rate data tariffs in 2006 and USB data modems in 2007 by major mobile operators.

In the panel study, various metrics on service usage can be derived directly from the device. The limitations of the panel study include the adverse selection of panelists and the limited amount of data available. If the dataset contained more P2P data sessions, the data traffic patterns could be studied in detail, including the distinction between WLAN and cellular P2P use.

### Future Research

Further research could involve applying more advanced P2P traffic identification methods to traffic trace measurements, such as Domain Name Server (DNS) based analysis and detection according to statistical identification functions. These advanced methods could facilitate the detection of other types of P2P protocols, such as Skype, which use random port numbers. While applying these methods, the peculiarities of GSM/UMTS and WLAN networks, such as longer access delays, should be considered. The panel results could be refined by having a more precise approach to MP2P application identification and by analyzing possible correlations between respondents' demographics and usage profiles.
