To add third-party Python libraries, such as BeautifulSoup, to your Google App Engine (GAE) project, follow these steps:

1. **Install the library locally**: First, ensure that you have the desired library installed in your local development environment. You can do this using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install beautifulsoup4
   ```

2. **Include the library in your project**:
   - **For GAE Standard Environment**: Use a `requirements.txt` file to list all the dependencies for your application. Add the following line to your `requirements.txt`:
     ```
     beautifulsoup4==<version>
     ```
     Replace `<version>` with the specific version you need.
   - **For GAE Flexible Environment**: Use a `requirements.txt` file similarly, or include the library in a `Dockerfile` if you are using a custom runtime.

3. **Deploy your application**: When you deploy your application, the `gcloud` command will automatically handle the installation of the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

Here is an example `requirements.txt` file:
```
beautifulsoup4==4.9.3
```

4. **Upload and deploy**:
   - For the Standard Environment, use the following command to deploy your application:
     ```bash
     gcloud app deploy
     ```
   - For the Flexible Environment, ensure your `app.yaml` or `Dockerfile` is correctly configured and then deploy:
     ```bash
     gcloud app deploy
     ```

By following these steps, you should be able to use any third-party Python library, including BeautifulSoup, in your Google App Engine project.
