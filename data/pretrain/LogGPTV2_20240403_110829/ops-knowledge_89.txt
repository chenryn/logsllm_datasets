To address your question regarding the configuration of multiple `php.ini` files for different sites on a shared host running Apache, it seems that you are encountering an issue due to the limitation in Apache's handling of the `PHPINIDir` directive. As noted, only the first `PHPINIDir` directive is honored within the entire configuration tree, which means that subsequent ones are ignored. This results in all sites using the same `php.ini` file if you attempt to set this directive in more than one virtual host.

### Suggested Solution: Using PHP-FPM with mod_fastcgi

A viable solution to achieve per-site `php.ini` configurations and individual PHP error logs would be to use **PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager)** along with Apache's **mod_fastcgi**. Hereâ€™s how you can set it up:

1. **Install PHP-FPM and mod_fastcgi:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install php5-fpm libapache2-mod-fastcgi
   ```

2. **Configure PHP-FPM Pools:**
   - Create a new pool configuration for each site. For example, create `/etc/php5/fpm/pool.d/my-domain.com.conf`:
     ```ini
     [my-domain.com]
     user = www-data
     group = www-data
     listen = /var/run/php5-fpm-my-domain.com.sock
     listen.owner = www-data
     listen.group = www-data
     pm = dynamic
     pm.max_children = 5
     pm.start_servers = 2
     pm.min_spare_servers = 1
     pm.max_spare_servers = 3
     chdir = /
     php_admin_value[error_log] = /srv/www/my-domain.com/logs/php_errors.log
     php_admin_flag[log_errors] = on
     php_admin_value[open_basedir] = /srv/www/my-domain.com/:/tmp/
     ```
   - Adjust the `php_admin_value` and `php_admin_flag` settings as needed to point to the correct `php.ini` file and log directories.

3. **Restart PHP-FPM:**
   ```bash
   sudo service php5-fpm restart
   ```

4. **Configure Apache to Use FastCGI:**
   - Edit the virtual host configuration for `my-domain.com` to use FastCGI. For example, modify `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/my-domain.com`:
     ```apache
     <VirtualHost 123.54.67.89:80>
         ServerAdmin me@my-domain.com
         ServerName my-domain.com
         ServerAlias www.my-domain.com
         DocumentRoot /srv/www/my-domain.com/www/
         ErrorLog /srv/www/my-domain.com/logs/error.log
         CustomLog /srv/www/my-domain.com/logs/access.log combined

         <FilesMatch \.php$>
             SetHandler "proxy:unix:/var/run/php5-fpm-my-domain.com.sock|fcgi://localhost/"
         </FilesMatch>
     </VirtualHost>
     ```

5. **Enable mod_fastcgi and Restart Apache:**
   ```bash
   sudo a2enmod fastcgi
   sudo service apache2 restart
   ```

### Summary
By using PHP-FPM and configuring separate pools for each site, you can specify unique `php.ini` settings and error log locations. This approach allows you to have fine-grained control over the PHP environment for each site hosted on your shared server.
