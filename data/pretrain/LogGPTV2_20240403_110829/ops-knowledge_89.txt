User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How do I configure multiple PHP.INI files on shared host running Apache? I would like to use a different PHP.INI file for each site hosted on a shared server.

I have modified the Apache vhosts file for each of the sites, adding the line…

PHPINIDir /srv/www/my-domain.com/


So the vhosts file /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/my-domain.com now reads thus…

&lt;VirtualHost 123.54.67.89:80&gt;
    ServerAdmin me@my-domain.com
    ServerName my-domain.com
    ServerAlias www.my-domain.com
    DocumentRoot /srv/www/my-domain.com/www/
    ErrorLog /srv/www/my-domain.com/logs/error.log
    CustomLog /srv/www/my-domain.com/logs/access.log combined
    PHPINIDir /srv/www/my-domain.com/
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;


On reloading Apache I get the following error.

Syntax error on line 8 of /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/my-domain.com:
Only first PHPINIDir directive honored per configuration tree - subsequent ones ignored
   ...fail!


Setting the PHPINIDir directive in just one of the vhosts files works, but then every site picks up that PHP.INI file.

We are running PHP5.3.2 on Ubuntu 10.04.

Any suggestions on how to achieve this?

P.S. The point of this is to have each site generating its own PHP error log.

Assistant: Have you already checked out php-fpm with apache's mod_fastcgi? It allows you to define exactly the configuration you need through pools, and you can even chroot the users! ;)
