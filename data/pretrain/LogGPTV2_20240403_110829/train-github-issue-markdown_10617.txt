I was taking a look at the default app. There's a menu item that causes the
app to enter fullscreen, but once in fullscreen the menu item doesn't change
from "Enter Fullscreen" to "Exit Fullscreen". This means that once you enter
fullscreen though the menu, you cannot exit it.
It seems to me that there should be some way of dynamically changing a menu
item's label inside of its own callback. I couldn't find a way to do this
without removing the entire menu, creating a new one, then adding it back, but
that felt rather heavy handed. Another way to do this would be by removing the
single menu item and adding a different one in its place (essentially swapping
it out), but there doesn't seem to be any more functionality allowing this
than there is for merely changing a label. (A request for the addition of
`Menu.remove()` can be found here.)
I would be willing to contribute to this if given some pointers. It should be
noted that I haven't worked with CoffeeScript except in passing, but I can
most likely figure it out.
