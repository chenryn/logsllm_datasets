ABSTRACT
Temperature sensing and control systems are widely used in the
closed-loop control of critical processes such as maintaining the
thermal stability of patients, or in alarm systems for detecting
temperature-related hazards. However, the security of these sys-
tems has yet to be completely explored, leaving potential attack
surfaces that can be exploited to take control over critical systems.
In this paper we investigate the reliability of temperature-based
control systems from a security and safety perspective. We show
how unexpected consequences and safety risks can be induced by
physical-level attacks on analog temperature sensing components.
For instance, we demonstrate that an adversary could remotely
manipulate the temperature sensor measurements of an infant in-
cubator to cause potential safety issues, without tampering with the
victim system or triggering automatic temperature alarms. This at-
tack exploits the unintended rectification effect that can be induced
in operational and instrumentation amplifiers to control the sensor
output, tricking the internal control loop of the victim system to
heat up or cool down. Furthermore, we show how the exploit of
this hardware-level vulnerability could affect different classes of
analog sensors that share similar signal conditioning processes.
Our experimental results indicate that conventional defenses
commonly deployed in these systems are not sufficient to mitigate
the threat, so we propose a prototype design of a low-cost anomaly
detector for critical applications to ensure the integrity of temper-
ature sensor signals.

1 INTRODUCTION
Embedded systems that utilize temperature sensors are extensively
employed in the supervision and automatic control of temperature-
sensitive environments such as in hospitals, laboratories, and in-
dustrial and manufacturing facilities [18, 28, 39, 69]. In particular,
closed-loop temperature control systems have become indispens-
able in many critical applications such as infant incubators that
maintain the thermal stability of low birth weight or sick newborns
[6], and blood bank or vaccine refrigerators that provide an optimal
preservation temperature in the cold chain [7, 10].
In this paper, we present a research study on the reliability of
temperature-based control systems and their sensors. Our study is
driven by the importance of security in safety-critical temperature-
based control systems and concerns about potential consequences
caused by compromised sensors. It may not be safe to assume that
these automatic systems would always behave as users expected
or could always be carefully attended to by alert human operators.
Moreover, some adverse effects caused by unsafe temperatures
can be subtle and may not be detected immediately. We notice that
there are reports about how safety issues can be related to improper
temperature control [27, 62, 75, 82]. For instance, deaths and injuries
to neonates in incubators have been linked to thermostat failure
that caused incubator overheating and infant hyperthermia [6].
In one case of a fatal incubator malfunction, an infant incubator
overheated and resulted in the death of a baby [75]. While the
incubator’s alarm went off, the nurses did not hear it because of the
noisy, busy environment in the neonatal intensive care unit. Besides,
poor refrigeration could make vaccines ineffective and leave the
patients unprotected against dangerous diseases, or increase the risk
of bacterial proliferation in blood products and cause potentially
life-threatening transfusion reactions [12, 27, 82]. Therefore, it is
necessary to investigate and understand the security and reliability
of critical temperature-based control systems.

nesses in temperature sensors to manipulate temperature-based
control systems. We show that, without tampering with the target
system, adversaries can remotely manipulate the control system or
circumvent temperature alarms by spoofing the temperature sensor
with electromagnetic interference (EMI) signals. Unlike previous
works that utilize the generation of subharmonics in non-linear
circuit components to demodulate out-of-band EMI signals [56], or
induce signal clippings in Electro-Static Discharge (ESD) protection
circuits of a microcontroller [71], our attack exploits the unintended
rectification effect in operational and instrumentation amplifiers
to generate a controllable DC component on the amplifier output
that can be used to manipulate the sensor readings (Fig. 1). We
conduct detailed signal injection experiments on a typical temper-
ature sensing circuitry and show that a stabilized voltage level can
be intentionally induced and controlled to increase or decrease
the sensor output. We analyze the vulnerability and attack surface
of circuit components with both direct power injection (DPI) and
remote signal injection experiments. We then investigate the effect
of remote attacks on several off-the-shelf temperature sensors and
control systems that use different amplifiers. In addition, we show
how this physical-level exploit can affect other classes of sensors
that share similar signal conditioning processes.
To explore potential consequences and understand the threats of
physical-level attacks on critical temperature-based control systems,
we study our attacks on an infant incubator and other real-world
systems. In particular, we show how an adversary can remotely ma-
nipulate an infant incubator temperature to cause life-threatening
issues. Without triggering the automatic temperature alarms, the
attack can trick the internal control system of the infant incubator
to heat the cabin up to 38.5◦C or cool it down to 29◦C, from at-
tack distances of 1.9 m and 1 m respectively in the open air with
a transmitting power of 4 W. These dangerous temperatures can
raise the risk of temperature-related health issues in infants, such
as hyperthermia and hypothermia, which in turn can lead to hyp-
oxia, neurological complications, and even death [8, 59, 78]. We
also investigate the threats on several systems equipped with dif-
ferent types of temperature sensors such as laboratory thermal
control equipment and 3D printers. Our experimental results show
that these systems blindly trust the spoofed temperature sensor
readings, resulting in manipulated decision makings of the victim
system.
Our study illustrates the threat of exploiting a low-level vul-
nerability of temperature sensors in critical control systems and
the necessity to mitigate this vulnerability. We discuss several con-
ventional defenses, such as filtering and shielding, as well as their
limitations. To enhance the robustness of critical temperature-based
control systems and shed light on defenses against rectification at-
tacks on sensors, we propose a low-cost anomaly detector that
identifies malicious interference in the vulnerable frequency range.
Once the interference is detected, the signal information can be
used by the system software to estimate the sensor data reliabil-
ity. Our study aims to raise the awareness of potential threats of
compromising temperature sensors and work towards improved se-
curity and resilience in future designs of critical temperature-based
systems.
In summary, we list our main contributions as follows:

sensors1.

components with DPI and remote EMI injection experiments, we
unveil the fundamental causality of the vulnerability. Further-
more, we show that the exploit of the rectification phenomenon
could affect other classes of sensors that use similar vulnerable
components.
• Based on the experimental results of our study, we discuss con-
ventional defensive strategies, their limitations and challenges;
then we propose a prototype design of an analog anomaly de-
tector to enhance the security and reliability of temperature-
based control systems.
2 BACKGROUND
In this work, we focus on the security of systems based on three
types of analog temperature sensors: thermocouples, Resistance
Temperature Devices (RTDs), and thermistors. Thermocouples oper-
ate on the Seebeck effect, which occurs when two dissimilar metals
are joined at one end. The output voltage is a direct function of the
temperature difference between the junction of the metals and the
target measurement point [69]. RTDs are constructed of a metal,
such as copper or platinum, which increases in resistance with
increasing temperature. Compared to thermocouples, they require
voltage or current excitation, and are generally more sensitive. Fi-
nally, thermistors are made of metal oxides and may have either a
negative or positive temperature coefficient. Negative temperature
coefficient thermistors (NTCs) decrease in resistance with increas-
ing temperatures, while positive temperature coefficient thermis-
tors (PTCs) increase in resistance with increasing temperatures.
Thermistors exhibit a much greater sensitivity than thermocouples
or RTDs. However, their operating temperature range is narrower.
Signal Conditioning of Analog Temperature Sensors. Analog
sensors require a signal conditioning phase before a data acquisi-
tion device can effectively process the signal. Analog temperature
sensors present specific signal conditioning requirements to provide
reliable and accurate measurements. For instance, the relationship
between the output voltage and the temperature measurements

linearity. For this reason, analog temperature sensors often require
high-resolution ADCs to achieve the desired accuracy [52]. Also,
thermocouples require an additional correction to the acquired
measurement called Cold-junction compensation (CJC). CJC ac-
counts for the voltage offset generated at the connection between
the thermocouple and the terminals of the acquisition device. In
comparison, RTDs are often placed in bridge circuits for detecting
small resistance changes. These additional considerations are used
to improve the measurement accuracy.
Furthermore, because of the low-level voltage, the output signal
from analog temperature sensors needs to be properly filtered and
amplified before further processing can occur (Fig. 1). RTDs and
thermistors voltage outputs are usually amplified by operational
amplifiers (op-amps), while thermocouples use instrumentation
amplifiers (in-amps) [54]. Both types of amplifiers provide the very
important function of extracting the small signals from the tem-
perature sensors, and also providing the adequate common-mode
noise rejection2. Filters, on the other hand, block out both common
and differential-mode noise, and the interference induced by the
50/60 Hz power.
Inadequate design specifications of these fundamental compon-
ents can be exploited by an adversary to gain control over the sensor
and induce the target system to make automated decisions based
on untrustworthy sensor data.
Rectification Effect in Amplifiers. The rectification effect in
amplifiers is a phenomenon that converts AC signals in input to
an amplifier to a DC offset component in the output signal. This
offset is the result of the non-linear voltage-current characteristics
of the internal diodes formed by silicon p-n junctions inside the
transistors (FETs or BJTs) that constitute the amplifier internal
input stage [3, 40, 41, 84]. Generally, the operating point of an
amplifier, also known as quiescent point, is the DC bias required
by an amplifier to operate correctly and amplify the input signal
without distortion. Especially in low-power amplifiers, where the
input stage transistors works at low current and low impedance
levels, a high frequency sine wave injection can alter the bias level
of the amplifier, generating a DC offset in the output signal.
For example, considering a small AC voltage Vx at frequency ωx
injected across the base-emitter junction ∆V = Vx cos(ωx t) of an
operational amplifier BJT-based input stage, the collector current
around the quiescent point can be express as I′
= IC(VBE + ∆V)
C
where VBE is the base-emitter voltage. Applying the Taylor series
expansion of the transistor collector current we can observe three
main spectral components: the quiescent collector current IC, cos(ωx t)
and cos2(ωx t). While the linear spectral term is filtered by other
stages within the device, the quadratic term remains and contains
two components, one depended by twice of the signal input fre-
quency (2ωx ) and a DC term [3]. This DC term is the rectification
effect, that can be expressed as a variation of the quiescent collector
current:
2Depending on the conduction mode, differential-mode (or normal-mode) noise appear
across the lines of an electric circuit following the same direction as the power supply
current. In contrast, in common-mode noise, current flows in the same direction along
different lines with the same voltage with reference to the earth [43].
