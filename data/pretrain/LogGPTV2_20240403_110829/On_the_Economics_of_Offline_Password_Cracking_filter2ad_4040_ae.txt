Figure 3 predicts that MHFs prevent a rational adversary
from cracking all passwords from a Zipf’s law distribution.
Of course, if the adversary still cracks 99.9% of passwords
then this result would not be particularly exciting. Figure 4
plots % cracked passwords vs. τ against a value v$ = $4
adversary. These plots provide an optimistic outlook for
MHFs. For example, the plots predict that we can signif-
icantly reduce the % of cracked passwords (easily below
20%) with out introducing unacceptably long authentication
delays when passwords follow a Zipf’s law distribution. By
contrast, the plots predict that we would need to set τ ≈ 2

(400+ seconds) to achieve the same result using PBKDF2
or BCRYPT when a = 1.

6. Model Independent Analysis
In this section we derive model-independent upper and
lower bounds on the % of users whose passwords would be
cracked by a rational adversary. The advantage of a model
independent analysis is that the bounds we derive apply even
if we do not make any assumptions about the shape of the
password distribution. As we observed previously it is not
possible to deﬁnitively claim that the tail of the password
distribution follows Zipf’s law — even if the tail of the
distribution is not known to be inconsistent with Zipf’s
law [32], [11]. The disadvantage of a model independent
analysis is that the bounds we are able to derive may not
always be tight as the bounds we may be able to derive
using speciﬁc modeling assumptions e.g., Zipf’s law. In this
section we assume for the sake of simplicity that a = 1
i.e., the marginal value of each additional cracked password
remains constant.
Suppose that we are given N independent samples

who chose password pwdi in a dataset and without loss of
generality assume that these frequencies are sorted so that
fi ≥ fi+1. We can use fi to obtain an estimate ^pi = fi
N for
pi, the true probability that that a random user selects the
password pwdi. While we do have ^pi ≥ ^pi+1 we stress
that we may no longer assume that pi ≥ pi+1 since our
empirical value ^pi (resp. ^pi+1) may over/under estimate
the true probability pi.
6.1. Lower Bound
Theorem 2 lower bounds the number of passwords that
will be cracked by a rational adversary in expectation. The
expectation is taken over N passwords sampled from X N.

The proof of Theorem 2 is in appendix A. The proof

We then introduce the notion of a (j, L)-bad overestimate. In

6.3. Applications
Theorems 2 and 3 allows us to derive different upper and
lower bounds by plugging in different values of j and L. For
example, by increasing j we decrease the term
(j−1)!Lj−1
in Theorem 2, but we also decrease the sum
i:fi≥j fi.
Increasing (resp. decreasing) L is equivalent to assuming
the adversary has a higher (resp. lower) value for cracked
passwords, which intuitively allows us to establish higher
lower bounds (resp. smaller upper bounds) on the percentage
of passwords cracked.

6.3.1. Lower Bounds. Applying Theorem 2 we can derive
speciﬁc lower bounds for each of the datasets studied by
[11] as well as for the Yahoo! frequency corpus. For most
datasets we obtain our lower bound by setting j = 2 and
L = 10. For the Yahoo! and RockYou datasets we obtained
better lower bounds by setting j = 3 and L = 10. The result
appears below:

Remark: When j = 1 we have
(j−1)!Lj−1 =
N−N = 0 meaning that Theorem 2 provides no lower bound
on the % of cracked passwords. At ﬁrst glance this may
appear to be a shortcoming of the theorem. However, we ob-
serve that it is impossible to obtain better lower bounds with-
out making assumptions about the password distribution. In
particular, let X1 (resp. X2) be the uniform distribution over
8n) passwords. Observe that X1 and X2
a set of 2
can induce dramatically different rational attacker behavior
(e.g., if the value of a password is 2
k, the adversary will
crack 100% of passwords if the true password distribution
is X1 and 0% of passwords if the true distribution is X2).
n samples from X1 and X2,
However, if we draw N = 2
then the frequency lists for the two password distributions
will be indistinguishable (f1 = f2 = . . . = fN = 1) by
birthday bounds (N (cid:9) 2
6.3.2. Upper Bounds. Similarly, we may use Theorem 3 to
derive model independent upper bounds on the percentage
of Yahoo! passwords cracked by a rational adversary as
shown in Figure 5. As Figure 5 shows we could potentially
use memory hard functions to reduce the % of cracked
passwords to ≈ 20% without increasing authentication time
1.5n).
