#### Q132. Understanding that multifactor authentication (MFA) is a best practice, which option should be avoided as a secondary authentication factor in MFA whenever possible?.
- [ ] biometric authentication
- [ ] OAUTH Token
- [ ] authenticator apps
- [x] SMS message
**Explanation**: SMS messages for MFA are generally considered less secure compared to other methods. This is because SMS messages can be vulnerable to interception (e.g., SIM swapping attacks), and the underlying telecommunication infrastructure may not provide sufficient protection against various attack vectors. Other MFA methods such as biometric authentication, OAUTH tokens, and authenticator apps are often considered more secure alternatives.
[Reference](https://www.zdnet.com/article/fbi-warns-about-attacks-that-bypass-multi-factor-authentication-mfa/) `"(...)All in all, MFA is still very effective at preventing most mass and automated attacks; however, users should be aware that there are ways to bypass some MFA solutions, such as those relying on SMS-based verification."`
