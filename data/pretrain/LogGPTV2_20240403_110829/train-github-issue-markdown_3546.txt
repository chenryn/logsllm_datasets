This error is very unintuitive for end-users, arrays formed from SQL query
results can frequently end up as object arrays by accident.
In [15]: arr = np.random.randn(100).astype(object)
## In [16]: np.log(arr)
AttributeError Traceback (most recent call last)
H:\workspace\Python\src in ()
AttributeError: log
Same AttributeError is raised for other ufuncs
