### Security Practices Among Vendors and Buyers on Hansa Market

#### 1. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Usage
Within the groups of Novices and Cybercrime Elites, approximately half of the vendors enabled 2FA. This suggests that experienced vendors, particularly those selling larger quantities of drugs, are more willing to undergo the additional verification steps provided by PGP.

#### 2. PGP Usage
Given that the security benefits of keys stronger than 2048 bits are negligible until 2030, we initially expected key sizes to be chosen randomly or according to PGP tutorials found on underground discussion forums. However, our analysis indicates otherwise (Table 4). Extremely secure keys are more frequently used by Drug Lords and Drug Dealers, while Cybercrime Elites and Digital Fraudsters use such keys less often. Notably, no Drug Lord uses weak keys. Despite variations in sample sizes, these findings suggest that the choice of key strengths is not coincidental. On Hansa Market, certain vendor types prefer 'extremely secure' keys, while others settle for regular 'secure keys'.

#### 3. PGP-Key Reuse
We analyzed the number of matched PGP-keys per vendor type, considering only vendors active on multiple markets. The differences between vendor types are modest (Table 4), as confirmed by a χ2-test (χ2 = 1.409, p = 0.8425). The proportion of vendors per cluster that could not be matched does not significantly differ between vendor types.

#### 4. Traceability of Cash-Out
Due to missing data, not all vendors have at least one payout address. Our analysis includes 716 Novices (-27.5%), 505 Drug Dealers (-0.8%), 109 Drug Lords (-0.9%), 98 Digital Fraudsters (-4.9%), and all Cybercrime Elites (n = 23).

We examined the practice of transacting directly to mainstream bitcoin exchanges or hosted wallets. Significant differences were observed among vendor types (Table 4). Surprisingly, Novices exhibit the most secure behavior, refraining from direct transactions to exchanges or hosted wallets. Conversely, nearly half of the Drug Lords, who are generally very security-aware, transact their profits directly to mainstream exchanges or hosted wallets, posing a serious security risk. Additionally, many Digital Fraudsters and especially Cybercrime Elites do not obfuscate their criminal profits.

### 5.3 Security Practices of Buyers
To compare the security behaviors of buyers and vendors, we analyzed password strength, 2FA usage, PGP adoption, and PGP-key lengths. Data on PGP-key reuse and traceability of cash-out are not available for buyers. Our comparison shows that, on average, vendors have better security practices than buyers (Table 5). Only 12.1% of buyers have a PGP-key listed, explaining the low 2FA usage among them. When considering only users with a PGP-key, the proportion of extremely secure PGP-keys (2048+ bits) is similar between vendors and buyers.

| **Metric** | **Vendors** | **Buyers** |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| **PW Strength (avg/median)** | 1010.5 / 1008.1 | 1014.7 / 1009.8 |
| **PW Uniqueness (%)** | 82.9 | 69.2 |
| **PGP Adoption (%)** | 60.5 | 12.1 |
| **2FA Usage (%)** | 99.7 | 3.4 |
| **2048+ Bits Keys (%)** | 48.4 | 47.2 |

### 6. Discussion

#### 6.1 Possible Explanations of Our Findings
We identified latent groups of vendors based on their market experience, sales volume, and activity on other markets. Subsequent analysis revealed surprising patterns in security practices. Vendors specializing in digital items, such as hacked accounts and credit card details, make the most frequent security mistakes. In contrast, successful drug dealers, particularly Drug Lords, exhibit the best digital security. They use complex and unique passwords, 2FA, and extremely secure PGP-keys. 

One possible explanation is that drug vendors perceive higher risks, anticipating greater law enforcement scrutiny and harsher punishments. Physical sales also generate more evidence, such as addresses and shipping information. Risk assessment can be subjective, leading to inconsistencies even among Drug Lords. Misconceptions, like the belief that Bitcoin transactions are completely anonymous, may influence decisions. Higher revenues from physical goods might enable vendors to hire specialized experts for security management.

#### 6.2 Limitations
1. **Single Market Focus**: Our research focuses on Hansa Market, limiting generalizability. Increased law enforcement scrutiny post-shutdown may have heightened security awareness.
2. **Missing Data**: Parts of our analysis are hampered by missing data. We reconstructed sales using feedback, which may underestimate digital sales. Password and Bitcoin address data were incomplete, but we believe our subsets include most active vendors.
3. **Data Sources**: Uncertainties arise from additional data sources like the Grams search engine and Chainalysis. These tools may introduce inaccuracies, potentially underestimating direct transactions to exchanges or hosted wallets.
4. **Additional Security Precautions**: Some vendors may have additional security measures outside the market, such as using money mules. While this complicates investigations, it remains an insecure practice.

#### 6.3 Implications
Our findings provide insights into exploitable security decisions made by cybercriminals, aiding law enforcement in understanding and predicting insecure practices. Vendors of digital items, despite their presumed security expertise, exhibit the most prevalent insecure practices. This knowledge can help allocate investigative resources more effectively.

### 7. Related Work
Our paper builds on recent advancements in measuring online anonymous markets, analyzing deviant security practices, and understanding risk assessment in a criminal context. Previous studies have performed large-scale measurements on vendors and transactions, clustered vendors into profiles, and investigated security practices. Our work contributes to the theoretical foundation of how cybercriminals deploy technical security controls and the cognitive biases leading to insecure practices.

### 8. Conclusions
In this study, we measured the prevalence of poor security practices on Hansa Market across different vendor types. We identified characteristics of vendors and clustered them into distinct types using latent profile analysis. Our findings show a clear distinction in security performance between experienced drug vendors and those selling digital items. By comparing buyers and vendors, we found that buyers generally have weaker security practices. Overall, our study reveals surprising patterns in security practices and highlights the need for further research to understand and address these issues.
