security the least often. Within the groups of Novices and
Cybercrime Elites, about half of the vendors enabled 2FA.
So, it appears that especially experienced vendors that sell
larger amounts of drugs, are willing to go through the hassle
of verifying their log-ins through PGP.
PGP usage. Considering that the security beneﬁt of any key
stronger than 2048-bits is negligible until the year 2030, we
initially expected that key sizes are chosen ‘randomly’ or
according to one of the PGP-tutorials found on underground
discussion fora. However, our analysis suggests the contrary
(Table 4). Extremely secure keys are more often found
among Drug Lords and Drug Dealers. The Cybercrime
Elites and Digital Fraudsters have extremely secure
keys the least often. Additionally, none of the Drug Lords
use weak keys. Although careful interpretation of the results
is necessary due to differences in sample sizes, these numbers
suggest that chosen key strengths are not a coincidence.
On Hansa Market, some types of vendors feel the need for
‘extremely secure’ keys, while other types of vendors tend to
settle for regular ‘secure keys’.
PGP-key reuse. We analyze the number of matched
PGP-keys per vendor type, in which we only consider the
vendors that are known to be active on multiple markets. It is
clear that the differences between between vendor types are
modest (Table 4). A χ2-test conﬁrms this. The proportion of
vendors per cluster that could not be matched, does not signif-
icantly differ between vendor types (χ2 = 1.409, p = 0.8425).
Traceability of cash-out. Due to missing data, we did
not ﬁnd at least one payout address for every vendor. Only
vendors associated with at least one payout address are
included in this analysis. Therefore, this analysis entails 716
Novices (-27.5%), 505 Drug Dealers (-0.8%), 109 Drug
Lords (-0.9%), 98 Digital Fraudsters (-4.9%) and all
Cybercrime Elites (n = 23).
We analyze how many vendors per vendor type exhibit the
insecure practice of transacting directly to mainstream bit-
coin exchanges or hosted wallet. We observe large differences
between vendor types regarding the proportion of vendors
that are directly linked to these exchanges and hosted wallets
(Table 4). This analysis yields two surprising conclusions.
First, Novices show the most secure behaviour - that is to
refrain from transacting their proﬁts directly to exchanges
or hosted wallets. Second, nearly half of the Drug Lords,
who proved to be very security-aware otherwise, have trans-
act their proﬁts directly to mainstream exchanges or hosted
wallets. This creates a serious risk to their security. Further-
more, we see that many Digital Fraudsters and especially
Cybercrime Elites do not bother to obfuscate their crimi-
nal proﬁts.
5.3 Security practices of buyers
To see if vendors are any different than other users on the
market, we compare the security behavior of buyers and ven-
dors regarding the strength and uniqueness of their passwords,
2FA usage, PGP-adoption and if applicable, chosen PGP-key
lengths 5. Data on PGP-key reuse and traceability of cash-out,
are not available for buyers. From this comparison it becomes
apparent that – on average – vendors do have better security
practices than buyers (Table 5). Or put differently, buyers even
have worse security practices compared to vendors. Note how-
ever, that a PGP-key is needed to be able to use 2FA. Since
only 12.1% of the buyers have a PGP-key listed, the low 2FA
usage is partly explained by the low PGP-adoption of buyers.
When we only consider the users with a PGP-key listed, the
proportion of users with extremely secure PGP-keys (2048+
bits) does not differ much between vendors and buyers.

pared. ‘PW strength’ states the average/median of the esti-
mated number of guesses a brute-force attack takes. ‘2048+’

6 Discussion
In this section, we will ﬁrst discuss possible explanations
of our ﬁndings. We next discuss the inherent limitations that
arise from our measurement approach and the data sources we
use. Last, we will touch upon the implications of our ﬁndings.
6.1 Possible explanations of our ﬁndings
We found latent groups of vendors that are similar regarding
their experience on the market, amounts of physical and dig-
ital items sold and activity on other markets. Subsequently,
we measured and compared the security performance of these
vendor types. Doing so, we uncovered surprising patterns in
security practices of the criminal entrepreneurs that operate
on online anonymous markets. Clusters of vendors that spe-
cialize in selling digital items, such as hacked accounts, credit
card details and databases of PII, make ‘mistakes’ in their
digital security the most often. Counter-intuitively, successful
drug dealers – i.e., Drug Dealers and Drug Lords – tend
to have the best digital security. Especially Drug Lords use

part of a lawful investigation. Using it is in accordance with prior practice [18,

complex and unique passwords. Additionally, they tend to
protect their accounts with 2FA and they encrypt their com-
munications using extremely secure PGP-keys. How can we
explain this pattern? Why do drug dealers have better digital
security than cybercriminal entrepreneurs?
One possible explanation is that on Hansa Market, vendors
of drugs perceived their risk to be higher than vendors of
digital items. The former may anticipate a greater probability
that their activities will draw law enforcement action. Pun-
ishment for drug vendors may also be more severe – drug
offenses are punishable by death in at least 35 countries [17].
The nature of physical sales can also generate more evidence,
such as addresses of buyers and shipping information stored
in databases of postal services.
Assessment of risk may be subjective [53], which may
explain some differences between and within groups. For
example, even Drug Lords do not behave consistently with
regards to password hygiene or preferred PGP-key lengths.
Furthermore, misconceptions – such as a belief that bitcoin
transactions are completely anonymous [46] – may impact
decisions. Misconceptions or behavioral pitfalls [55] may
have led Drug Lords to make choices like cashing out to
well-known exchanges.
Possible explanations beyond risk perception exist for the
practices and differences observed. For example, revenue for
physical goods is much greater than for digital goods (see
Figure 1). Vendors with higher earnings could be more likely
to hire specialized experts to manage postings and security.
A user study of vendors could help conﬁrm the source of the
differences in observed practices.
6.2 Limitations
First, our research focuses on a single online anonymous
market: Hansa Market. Naturally, this is a limiting factor in
our ability to generalize our ﬁndings. After the shutdown
of Hansa Market and AlphaBay in Operation Bayonet, the
continued scrutiny by law enforcement might have resulted
in an increased security-awareness among those conducting
business on online anonymous markets. This would mean
that we observe a time frame wherein vendors are operating
less securely, compared to today. Future research should try
to replicate our analysis and see if security practices in the
underground economy have evolved.
Second, parts of our analyses are hampered by missing
data. We have addressed the issue of purged order data, by
reconstructing the number of sales using the number of feed-
backs per listing. We can expect that buyers are less likely to
provide feedbacks on digital items, compared to providing
feedback on physical items – given that feedbacks generally
report on delivery and packaging. As a result, the amount
of digital sales may be underestimated in some cases. Next,
we did not have any data on plaintext passwords and bitcoin
addresses for all vendors. Therefore, we performed the anal-
ysis of password strength and password uniqueness, and the
analysis of the traceability of cash-outs on different subsets
of data. Yet, we believe that these subsets contain most of the
active vendors – since plaintext passwords are available for
all vendors that logged on to Hansa in a time span of a month
and bitcoin payout addresses are available for orders initiated
up to 180 days before the inﬁltration of the market.
Third, the additional data sources we utilize, introduce
some uncertainties. Although the Grams search engine was
build on databases of online anonymous markets crawled via
a special-purpose API, we cannot determine the accuracy or
completeness of the Grams database. This may have resulted
in unrecognized reuse of PGP-keys. Along this same vain,
we are dependent on insights provided by the Chainalysis
service. This tool uses proven heuristics to determine what
bitcoin addresses belong to known intermediaries in the bit-
coin ecosystem. As these heuristics still may fail, Chainalysis
might falsely return that a certain bitcoin address does not
belong to an exchange or hosted wallet, while it in fact does.
Note, that untraceability of cash-out therefore, can be the re-
sult of vendors’ behavior, limitations of blockchain analysis,
or a combination of both. Either way – as law enforcement
agencies face these limitations of blockchain analysis as well
– investigators are equally hampered by any of the underlying
causes for such untraceability. However, this means we have
underestimated the amount of direct transactions to main-
stream exchanges or hosted wallets.
Fourth, an inevitable limitation of our research is that some
vendors may have additional security precautions in place
outside the scope of the market to start investigators off on the
wrong foot. For example, the more professional cybercriminal
entrepreneur may use money mules to cash-out their proﬁts.
Instead of identifying the actual vendor, a subpoena might
therefore result in identifying the individual that – perhaps
unknowingly – aids the vendor in laundering its money by
transferring funds between accounts. Still, we argue that leav-
ing easy-to-trace transactional links to money mules is an
insecure practice.
Implications
6.3
Although in the past anecdotal evidence was presented by
law enforcement and industry reports on the failing security
practices of cybercriminals, we did not know if this was just
a lucky break or a pattern of poor security. We now know
that at least on Hansa, the latter was the case. Given the shear
amount of cybercrime to choice from to investigate, efﬁciency
in the prosecution of cybercrime is key [53]. Our ﬁndings
shine a light on exploitable security decisions cybercriminals
make. Therefore, we are now better equipped to adequately
understand and predict the insecure practices of a cybercrimi-
nal entrepreneur and how law enforcement can invest in these.
Most notably, we show that among vendors that specialize in
trading digital cybercrime items – of whom it would be as-

sumed to have their digital security well organized – insecure
practices are most prevalent. These ﬁndings may aid allocat-
ing the scarce capacity of law enforcement investigators more
effectively. Instead of waiting for this one lucky break, or case
of low-hanging fruit, it seems that even the most seasoned
cybercriminals have at least one weak spot.
likelihood of law enforcement prosecution [43]. ‘Simple
downloaders’ often lack technological knowledge and are
easily identiﬁed, whereas producers of online child abuse
material have very high security standards [40]. Similarly,
Van de Sandt [53] reasons that cybercriminals who are not
fully aware of the illegality of their acts, tend to have little to
no security mechanisms in place.
7 Related Work
Our paper builds on and beneﬁts from recent advancements
into a number of topics. First, our work relates to measure-
ments of the anatomy and economics of online anonymous
markets. Second, we can identify similar analyses compared
to our investigation of ‘deviant security’ practices. Third and
last, we beneﬁt from and contribute to the research body
on risk assessment in a criminal context. In this section, we
discuss related work on these three topics.
Measuring online anonymous markets.
Similar to our
work, Christin [7], Soska et al. [49], and Van Wegberg
et al. [58] perform large scale measurements on vendors,
listings and transactions on online anonymous markets.
Moreover, Van Wegberg et al. [57] similarly cluster vendors
into ‘vendor proﬁles’ using LPA. In sharp contrast to that
body of work, we base our analyses not on scraped, but
unique ground-truth data. Security practices of users that
operate on online anonymous market is also investigated in
earlier work [59]. Here, the authors measure whether vendors
stick with their PGP-key and/or username when switching
markets. Likewise, Soska & Christin [49] assess the adoption
of PGP among vendors active on markets between 2012-2015.
Cybercriminal security practices.
Beneﬁcial to our
analyses, Van de Sandt [53] – through a grounded theory
approach – develops a theoretical foundation on how
cybercriminals deploy technical computer security controls.
Additionally, he uses micro-economic theories to unravel
the security practices of cybercriminals. Other work that
connects to this paper are advancements made by Van
Hardeveld [55, 56]. He discusses the cognitive biases that
lead to insecure practices of carders 6. Additionally, both
authors conduct expert interviews and analyze technical
security mechanisms mentioned in online carding tutorials.
Risk assessments. One of the possible explanations for the
observed differences in security practices, is the perceived
risks of certain illicit activities. Other work elaborates on the
security practices of those who engage in the consumption
or production of online child abuse material. These types
of cybercriminals seem to prioritize their security practices
based on the severity of potential punishment and the

ground community.
8 Conclusions
In this paper, we measured the prevalence of poor security
practices on Hansa Market across different types of vendors.
We identiﬁed characteristics of vendors that can explain their
security practices and clustered vendors that have similar
characteristics into distinct ‘vendor types’ using latent proﬁle
analysis. We captured password strength, password unique-
ness, the use of two-factor authentication, PGP-key strength,
PGP-key reuse and the traceability of cash-outs of Hansa
Market vendors. Then, we measured the prevalence of poor
security practices across vendor types. We contrasted these
ﬁndings with the practices of buyers. Finally, we explored
possible explanations for the observed differences in security
practices.
We found that security practices do not occur at random.
There is a clear distinction in the security performance be-
tween the deﬁned types of vendors. We observed a dichotomy
in security practices between on the one hand two clusters
of relatively experienced vendors that sold large amount of
drugs and on the other hand two clusters of vendors that spe-
cialize in selling digital items. The former group prioritizes
their security, while vendors belonging to the latter resort to
insecure practices more often.
By comparing the security practices of buyers with that of
vendors, we found that on average, buyers use less complex
passwords, have less often an unique password and that very
few buyers use 2FA as an additional security measure. The
latter is partly due to the low PGP-adoption among buyers
(12% vs almost 100%).
In conclusion, we found surprising patterns in the security
practices of users that operate on online anonymous markets.
Clusters of vendors that specialize in selling digital items
make ‘mistakes’ in their digital security the most often, while
vendors belonging to clusters of successful drug dealers tend
to have the best digital security. Additionally, we conclude that
many vendors – including the highly successful ones – make
the mistake of initiating traceable cash-outs to mainstream
bitcoin exchanges and hosted wallet providers.
Regarding the generalizability of our ﬁndings, it is impor-
tant to note that we focused on only one market: Hansa Market
(2015-2017). We also had to overcome some issues with partly
