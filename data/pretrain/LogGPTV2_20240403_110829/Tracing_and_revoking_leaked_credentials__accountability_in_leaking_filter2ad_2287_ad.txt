iﬁed in encryption. Table 1 clearly reveals the performance
cost incurred by the a posteriori approach of digital forensics
in outsourcing data to clouds. In addition to the unavoid-
able process of digital forensics, only the system setup and
user admission procedures are aﬀected. We stress that both
procedures are only executed once in an oﬄine stage with
respect to outsourcing ﬁles. Surprisingly, adding credential
leakage traceability aﬀects neither ﬁle creation nor access:
the users can create ﬁles and access them normally without
any signiticant overhead. These features render our TRLAC
scheme an outstanding solution to a posteriori protection of
data outsourced to an untrusted third party.
Table 2 compares our TRLAC scheme with other schemes
achieving traceability of leaked access credentials in terms
of performance, tracing manner (black-box or white-box),
bilinear group type (prime-order or composite-order) and
revocation support.
In this table, the schemes in [5], [6]
and [12] are devised for the broadcast encryption and N
denotes the number of total users in the systems. The works
from [16] to [18] following [6] aim to provide traceability for
attribute-based encryption, thus their performance depends
on the number of attributes, in which |U| denotes the size of
the attribute universe, |γ| the size of the set γ of attributes
associated with a user, |A| the size of an access structure
associated with a ciphertext and |γ∗| denotes the size of a
set γ∗ satisfying the access structure. The work [14] supports
identity-based traitor tracing system, in which a data owner
can choose only one group to access his data at a time, in
contrast to a set of groups in our TRLAC scheme. It can
be seen that all the schemes except ours, [12] and [14] are
constructed in composite-order bilinear groups.
Note that the performance of composite-order bilinear
groups is much (about one order) lower than in prime-order
bilinear groups for the same security level. For instance, the
scheme [12] is shown to encrypt 6 times faster and decrypt 10
times faster than [5] for the same level of security. Compared
to our TRLAC scheme, however, the decryption time of [12]
is linear with the size of the vector space which is used to
simulate the orthogonality of composite-order groups. More-
over, this scheme [12], as well as [5, 6, 17, 18], requires the
ciphertext to be linear with the quadratic root of the num-
ber N of total users, which means that the encrypted ﬁles
to be stored in the cloud will be very large.
Table 2 reveals the superior practicality of our scheme.
Let m denote the maximal size of the set of groups. It can
be seen that the ciphertext size and pairing computations in
decryption are both constant, which provides a cost-eﬀective
way for users to securely outsource and access their ﬁles.
Although the scheme of [14] achieves the same encryption
and decryption eﬃciency, it does not support revocation,
which is seen as an important mechanism to protect data
security after the tracing results come out. Compared to
other schemes, the public key size of our TRLAC is also
short, since the parameter m is usually less than the size
of total attributes in [16, 17, 18], the quadratic root of the
number of total users in [5, 6, 12] and the code length in [14].
Although the private key size is linear with the code length
l (which can be relatively short by setting reasonably big
 and small t in a practical scenario), the key generation
algorithm is only executed once by the TTP in an oﬄine
stage with respect to outsourcing ﬁles. This conﬁrms the
practical attractiveness of our solution.
6.2 Experimental Analysis
We conducted a series of experiments on a PC with 4-core
Intel Core i3-2130 CPU running at 3.4GHz, 2.0G RAM, us-
ing the C programming language in Windows 7. The in-
volved cryptographic operations (e.g., pairing, exponenti-
ation) were implemented by using the Pairing-Based Cryp-
tography library version 0.5.12 (available at http://crypto.
stanford.edu/pbc). In the experiments, we evaluated the
performance of each procedure of the TRLAC scheme.
We employed Nuida et al.’s ﬁngerprint codes which have
shorter length than Tardos codes. Recall that to achieve t-
collusion resistant traceability with a total number n of users
with error probability , the length of their ﬁngerprint codes
is given by Expression (1). Since the traceability is uniquely
determined by the ﬁngerprint code length l, we conduct ex-
periments with diﬀerent code length. Consider a practical
scenario where the created ﬁle is allowed to be accessed by
diﬀerent departments of diﬀerent companies and each de-
partment has usually a staﬀ size n at most 100. It seems
reasonable to assume that at most t ≤ 5 staﬀ member’s ac-
cess credentials are compromised. Suppose that tracing to
an incorrect staﬀ member has probability  ≈ 10−5. For
such a practical scenario, according to Expression (1), we
have that the ﬁngerprint code has length l ≤ 50. Thus, in
the experiments, we set l = 50, 100,··· , 500. Besides, the
system performance is also related to the maximal size m of
set, which is determined at the setup phase, and the size |S|
of set S decided in encryption. For the above scenario, it
seems reasonable to set the number of diﬀerent companies
to 100, i.e., m = 100. We thus conduct our experiments
with |S| equal to 20, 40, 60 and 80 as well.
The system setup procedure run by TTP outputs a system
master public key of size linear in m. For m = 100, the time
Figure 2: Time consumed in user admission
Figure 3: Time consumed in ﬁle creation
consumed by this procedure turns out to be about 440.5ms,
which is negligible for a TTP which will usually have more
powerful equipment than our PC.
Fig. 2 shows the time to register a user to the system. It
can be seen that the time consumed by the user admission
procedure grows linearly with the length of ﬁngerprint codes.
The lowest point means that to trace t ≤ 5 employees who
leaked their credentials in a company’s department of 100
staﬀ, therequired code lengt is about 50 bits, which yields a
time about 200ms to produce a private key. If the number of
dishonest employees leaking credentials increases to t ≤ 30,
the code length needs to grow to 500 bits and the time to
produce a private key is near 1.9s (represented by the highest
point). These results show that our system can tolerate a
large number of traitors who leaked their credentials while
keeping a manageable cost for TTP.
Fig. 3 shows the time to create a ﬁle to be stored in the
cloud. The four lines represent four diﬀerent sizes of the set
of encryption groups, respectively: 20, 40, 60 and 80. It can
be seen that none of these lines varies as the code length
grows. The time consumed by ﬁle creation is only linear in

the size of encryption groups. Even for the largest value 80,
which means the ﬁle is intended to be shared with 80 groups,
the time consumed by this procedure is about 630ms, which
is a low cost for users to encrypt their outsourced data.
Fig. 4 shows the time to access a ﬁle. It can be seen that
the time consumed by the ﬁle access procedure does not de-
pend on the code length either.
It only grows linearly in
the size of encryption groups. The four lines represent the
time costs associated with diﬀerent sizes of the set of encryp-
tion groups, respectively. For the largest size of 80 groups,
the time to access a ﬁle is only about 300ms. Therefore,
with millisecond-level ﬁle creation and ﬁle access times, our
TRLAC scheme provides an eﬃcient protection for users to
secure their outsourced data.
The group revocation procedure in our scheme is also very
eﬃcient in the sense that it only requires two exponentia-
tions for a ﬁle. We tested that in our PC the time taken by
the TTP to revoke access rights of a group is near 16.4ms.
We note that this procedure is only executed by the TTP
and does not take the user any time.
From the experimental analyses above, our TRLAC scheme
provides an eﬃcient way for users to protect the security of
their outsourced data. Users can encrypt their data at a low
cost before outsourcing them to clouds and the time for any
authorized user to access the stored ﬁles is even less. The
introduction of traceability incurs almost no extra cost for
the ﬁle creation and access. Even for user admission, the
procedure that is most aﬀected by the introduction of trace-
ability, the cost is acceptable. A user can also revoke access
privileges of a group to access his ﬁles without having to do
himself any computation.
7. CONCLUSION
This paper has presented countermeasures to ﬁght ille-
gal leakage of access credentials. We presented TRLAC, a
system for tracing and revoking leaked access credentials.
Formal proofs show that the proposed scheme is t-collusion
resistant. Finally, we conducted a comprehensive perfor-
mance evaluation. Our analyses shows that the proposed
scheme has reasonable performance after being equipped
with a mechanism to trace and revoke compromised access
credentials.
