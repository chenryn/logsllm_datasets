Hey.  
So I briefly talked with @tacaswell about this. I mostly use scatter to show a
discrete third variable via color (say I plot weight vs height and want to
color by gender). The current scatter is not entirely equipped for this,
because it doesn't really allow me to create the legend that I want, and I
doesn't allow me to use cyclers on the symbols or color.  
What I want can be relatively trivially implemented as a for-loop over the
unique values of the discrete variable, and calling plot once for each.  
I use this A LOT, and other data sciency folks, too, I think, so it would be
nice to have a one-liner for this, i.e. implement a function that does that
for you.
My question is:  
Should this go into matplotlib or somewhere else?  
If it should go into matplotlib, should it go into scatter or into a new
function?
