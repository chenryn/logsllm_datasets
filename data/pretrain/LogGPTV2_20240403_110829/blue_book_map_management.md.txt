As someone who values privacy, I strive to minimize my use of proprietary software and services. This principle extends to map management. While Google Maps has become the dominant player in mapping and routing, there are several superior alternatives available.

For on-the-go navigation, I highly recommend [OSMand+](osmand.md). For browsing maps in a web browser, you can use [OpenStreetMap](https://osm.org) or [CyclOSM](https://www.cyclosm.org), especially if you prefer cycling.

For route planning, [brouter.de](https://brouter.de/brouter-web) is an excellent choice, particularly for cyclists. It also works well for hiking, providing a wealth of data to help you plan your routes (be sure to check the settings on the right). If you're willing to invest some time, you can even create [personalized profiles](https://github.com/poutnikl/Brouter-profiles/wiki/Hiking-profiles) to tailor the routing algorithm to your preferences. 

Both [brouter](https://github.com/abrensch/brouter) and its web interface can be self-hosted, though it's worth noting that [brouter does not yet support Docker](https://github.com/abrensch/brouter/issues/359).

By using these open-source tools, you can maintain your privacy while enjoying robust and flexible map management solutions.
