Hi,  
There's a problem when i want to remove directories retrieved by finder
instance. The problem is that the directory is successfully deleted but there
was an exception generated after that:
RecursiveDirectoryIterator::__construct(/home/fattouch/NordnetProjects/diamant/app/../web/data/tmp/in/email/attachments):
failed to open dir: No such file or directory
