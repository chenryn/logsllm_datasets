Subject: Issue with Deleting Directories Using Finder

Hi,

I encountered a problem while attempting to delete directories retrieved using the Finder instance. Although the directory is successfully deleted, an exception is generated afterward:

```
RecursiveDirectoryIterator::__construct(/home/fattouch/NordnetProjects/diamant/app/../web/data/tmp/in/email/attachments): failed to open dir: No such file or directory
```

Could you please help me understand why this exception is being thrown and how to resolve it?

Thank you.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
