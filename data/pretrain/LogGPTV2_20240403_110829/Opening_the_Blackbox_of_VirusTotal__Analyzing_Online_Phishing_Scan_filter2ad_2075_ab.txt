### Experimental Setup and Measurement Results

#### Initial Setup
At the beginning of the first week, we submitted the URLs of 38 phishing websites to the VirusTotal scan API. These sites were then monitored for incoming traffic over the next four weeks. The 38 websites included 19 PayPal phishing sites and 19 IRS (Internal Revenue Service) phishing sites. All PayPal sites had identical web page content but were hosted under different domain names. Similarly, all IRS sites shared the same content but used different domain names.

#### Summary
- **Total Websites**: 38 (36 for the main experiment, 2 for the baseline)
- **PayPal Sites**: 19
- **IRS Sites**: 19

### Measurement Results

Our measurements yielded several important findings, as detailed below:

#### Incoming Network Traffic
- **Traffic Volume**:
  - PayPal sites received significantly more network traffic compared to IRS sites.
  - On average, each PayPal site received over 12,000 requests, while each IRS site received only 335 requests.
- **Traffic Patterns**:
  - IRS sites had minimal traffic in the first week, with an increase starting in the second week.
  - PayPal sites were flagged by some vendors immediately in the first week, leading to higher traffic.
  - For the IRS site in the baseline experiment, submitting the URL to VirusTotal once failed to detect it, resulting in almost no traffic in subsequent weeks.

#### Analysis of Traffic Logs
- **Request Types**:
  - Not all requests were directed to the submitted phishing URLs. Some scanners also attempted to access resources under the root directory ("/") or non-existent pages like "payload.php" or "shell.php".
  - For example, in the baseline experiment, the PayPal site received 6,291 requests for the phishing URL and 19,222 requests for other URLs or resources, indicating that scanners were looking for signs of malware hosting or website compromise.

#### Delay in Label Updating
- **Label Update Delay**:
  - VirusTotal has a delay in updating labels to its database. The querying API returns "benign" labels if the URLs have not been scanned before.
  - After a second scan, the first scan results are updated in the VirusTotal database.
  - For instance, in the first week, PayPal URLs submitted on day-1 returned "benign" labels. On day-4, after resubmitting, the API started returning "malicious" labels from some vendors, which were actually from the day-1 scan.

#### Inconsistent Labels
- **Inconsistencies**:
  - There were inconsistencies between the VirusTotal scan and vendor scans. Table 3 shows that some vendors, such as Forcepoint, Sucuri, Quttera, URLQuery, ZeroCERT, and Google Safe Browsing, showed a "0-1-0" pattern for PayPal sites.
  - This indicates that these vendors' scanners did not trigger through VirusTotal, leading to benign labels even though their own APIs detected the pages as malicious.
  - For IRS pages, Fortinet, Google Safe Browsing, and Netcraft detected them via their own APIs, but only Netcraft shared this result with VirusTotal.

#### Detection Accuracy
- **Vendor Performance**:
  - Table 4 lists 15 vendors that detected at least one phishing site during the first two weeks.
  - The most effective vendor, Netcraft, flagged 14 out of 18 PayPal pages and 12 out of 18 IRS pages.
  - Some vendors consistently flagged the same subset of phishing sites, suggesting possible synchronization of blacklists.

#### Reaction to Phishing Takedown
- **Takedown Response**:
  - Vendors did not quickly remove URLs from their blacklists after the phishing sites were taken down.
  - Figure 7 shows that four vendors (CyRadar, CLEAN MX, Fortinet, and Avira) flipped some "malicious" labels to "benign" after the third week, but the labels were often reversed in the next scan.

### Additional Controlled Experiments

To address new questions, we conducted additional controlled experiments with 27 new sites. These experiments aimed to identify which vendors visited the phishing sites, the impact of simple obfuscation techniques, and the detection accuracy of benign pages.

#### Vendor Identification
- **Challenges**:
  - Identifying vendors based on network traffic was difficult due to the use of proxies and cloud services.
  - We successfully confirmed the identity of five vendors: Dr. Web, Forcepoint, Google Safe Browsing, Quttera, and ZeroCERT.
  - Further controlled experiments by submitting URLs to 18 vendors individually did not yield reliable identifiers for all vendors due to dynamic IP changes and the use of cloud services.

This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the effectiveness and behavior of various security vendors and the VirusTotal platform in detecting and responding to phishing websites.
