across the different areas. We observe a sharp decrease in the

traffic volumes in the radio cells in Cosmopolitans cluster ar-
eas (decrease of more than 50% in week 13 in the uplink and
the downlink data volume), while cells in the "Multicultural
clusters" cluster areas show an increase the mobile traffic
volume (e.g., 40% increase in the uplink data volume). These
correlate with the patterns we observe for the number of
active downlink users in the same areas (i.e., a more than
20% increase in week 13).
Takeaway: We find again a sharper decrease in the up-
link/downlink data volume in the areas that cluster as "Cos-
mopolitans", largely matching the behaviour we observed in
the EC and WC districts, due to the severe reduction of users
in these areas. Cells in the "Multicultural clusters" cluster
areas show an increase the mobile traffic volume largely due
to an increase in the number of active users.
6 RELATED WORK
Even though the spread of SARS-CoV-2 started only a few
months ago, there are already in the literature different
studies that present efforts for understanding human mobil-
ity during the interventions. Apart from cell phone traces,
as used in our study and in others [22], there are other
datasets that other studies investigate. Google has available
anonymized and aggregated private counts of visits to places
in different categories [31][19][23]; also, Facebook trough
its Disease Prevention maps has provided aggregated data
of spatial distribution of individuals [25][16]; Cuebiq has
provided GDPR-compliant information to model mobility
in Boston [4] and Italy [27]; and Baidu has provided in-flow
and out-flow indexes for Chinese cities [8]. In general, all the
previous studies highlight the drastic changes in mobility
and evaluate the impact of the interventions in the spread
of the virus. In the particular case of the UK, TomTom [30]
observed a reduction between 60% and 80% in the number of
trips during lockdown, which is consistent with the reduc-
tion we observe from the MNO. Also, [21], by combining cell
phone traces and Facebook data to identify number of jour-
neys, concluded that mobility began to decrease around one
week before lockdown was enforced, but that the sharpest
drop was after the closure, similarly to our findings using
different metrics.
The overall topic of the impact of COVID-19 in network
traffic has also been subject to numerous reports. For exam-
ple, Comcast, which provides mobile connectivity using WiFi
while at home but leverages on Verizon LTE while away, has
observed and increase of 39% in wifi and a decrease of 17%
of mobile LTE traffic. Regarding the increase of the different
types of applications, there was a 215-285% increase in VoIP
and videoconferencing traffic, 30-40% in VPN traffic and a
20-40% in streaming and web video consumption.[9]. In the
context of network traffic and distance learning, of critical
13
relevance during COVID-19, the work by Favale at al. [10]
found that incoming traffic drastically decreased, while out-
going traffic more than doubled to support online learning.
By combining datasets from one ISP, three IXPs, and one met-
ropolitan educational network, Feldmann et. al. [11] show
that the fixed internet infrastructure was able to sustain the
15-20% increase in traffic that happened rapidly during a
short window of one week. Taking the point of view from
Facebook’s edge, Böttger et.al. [7] show that that different re-
gions of the world saw different magnitudes of impact, with
predominantly less developed regions exhibiting larger per-
formance degradations. The Cellular Telecommunications
Industry Association (CTIA) provides daily reports on the
variations of voice and data minutes observed by AT&T, T-
Mobile, U.S. Cellular and Verizon. With respect to the period
between the 23 of February and the 16 of March, it was ob-
served a surge of the upper range of voice minutes used of
up to +24% in the last week of march (week 13) and an in-
crease of about +20% in the upper range of data minutes[5].
While the surge reported in voice traffic is within the ranges
observed in this paper, we do not observe the surge in data
traffic reported by the main MNOs in the U.S. This may be
due to different prevalence of flat fee contracts in the U.S.
operators and the U.K. MNO we study. Similarly, BT in the
U.K., on March the 20th 2020 [6], reported a decrease of 5%
in mobile data traffic which is consistent with the decrease
described in this paper for week 12. It was also observed a
surge in voice traffic, and as a result BT encouraged users to
use landline services, especially for long conference calls.
7 CONCLUSIONS
The lockdown measures implemented by the UK government
to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus drastically changed
user mobility patterns and network traffic. The results of
this paper present an analysis of the changes in mobility
and their impact on the cellular network traffic. Regarding
mobility, we observed an overall decrease of 50%, with non-
uniform changes across different geographical areas and so-
cial backgrounds, which confirm previous findings [30][21].
These variations translated into a surge of voice traffic (up
to 150%) accompanied by an overall decrease of download
traffic (20%), especially in densely populate urban areas (-
60%), and an increase of uplink traffic in suburbanities (10%).
Despite significant pattern changes, the MNO was able to
provide service maintaining quality standards: the radio load
was below common values and per user throughput was
likely application limited. We identified one issue in voice
traffic packet loss due to exceeded capacity in the intercon-
nection infrastructure MNOs use to exchange voice traffic,
which was was fixed by network operation teams.
A ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
The data collection and retention at network middle-boxes
and elements are in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the MNO and the local regulations. All datasets used in this
work are covered by NDAs prohibiting any re-sharing with
3rd parties even for research purposes. Further, raw data has
been reviewed and validated by the operator with respect
to GPDR compliance (e.g., no identifier can be associated to
person), and data processing only extracts aggregated user
information at postcode level. No personal and/or contract
information was available for this study and none of the
authors of this paper participated in the extraction and/or
encryption of the raw data.
