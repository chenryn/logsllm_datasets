User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题What Group Policy settings MUST be set within the Default Domain Policy? Does anyone have an authoritative source of policies that, if set, MUST be set within the Default Domain Policy (if one chooses to set them)?  Off the top of my head, I know that password policies and certain user session policies must be set within the Default Domain Policy.  I'm doing a cleanup of our Domain GPOs and trying to separate any GPs that can be set outside the default...

To clarify, I am not asking what policies must be set, I am asking which policies, should I choose to set them, must be set within the Default Domain Policy.

Assistant: The settings you're looking for are enumerated in Group Policy application rules for domain controllers, insofar as how Domain Controller (DC) computers apply Group Policy Object (GPO) settings that are set at the domain level. You don't necessarily need to specify these settings in the "Default Domain Policy" (and, indeed, I would recommend not modifying the "Default Domain Policy"). Rather, the resultant set of these settings, based on the link order of the GPOs at the root of the domain, determines the effective setting the DCs will apply.

The settings include the following for all Active Directory DCs.


Account Policies
Security Options settings: "Automatically log off users when logon time expires", "Rename administrator account", and "Rename guest account".


Windows Server 2003-based DCs (and, presumably, Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2-based DCs) will also apply the Security Options settings:


Accounts: Administrator account status
Accounts: Guest account status
Accounts: Rename administrator account
Accounts: Rename guest account
Network security: Force logoff when logon hours expire
