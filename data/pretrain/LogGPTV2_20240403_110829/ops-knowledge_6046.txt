User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk shows the process of assigning tasks to the executor, running the tasks, and sending the results back to the driver. The python runner is also tracking the total, boot, init, and finish times for each task. Additionally, the storage block manager is finding blocks locally.
