**Description:**
The `pktmon unload` command stops the PktMon driver service and unloads the `PktMon.sys` driver. This action is functionally equivalent to running `sc.exe stop PktMon`. When executed, any ongoing measurements will be immediately halted, and all associated state information, such as counters and filters, will be deleted.

**Syntax:**
```sh
pktmon unload
```

This command is useful for stopping packet monitoring and cleaning up any active state, ensuring that the system returns to its original configuration.
