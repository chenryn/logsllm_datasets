is because TV signals are signiﬁcantly attenuated in indoor loca-
tions and hence the ambient signal strength is much lower.
• Locations 1 and 3 perform slightly worse than locations 2 and
4, even though they are closer to the TV tower. This is due to
the fact that the TV tower is not an ideal isotropic antenna: the
radiated power is less at low angles, and thus the signal strength
is less at the near locations.
• For a target BER6 of 10−2, the receiver can receive at a rate of
1 kbps at distances up to 2.5 feet in outdoor locations and up to
1.5 feet in indoor locations. Such rates and distances are sufﬁ-
cient to enable ubiquitous communication in multiple scenarios,
including our proof-of-concept applications.
6.3 Evaluating Carrier Sense
We implement carrier sense using both energy detection and
preamble correlation. Energy detection is performed by comput-
ing D = 1 − |#ones−#zeros|
#ones+#zeros , where #ones and #zeros denote the
number of ones and zeros seen at the receiver, within a 10-bit inter-
val. Preamble correlation is performed by correlating with a known
64-bit preamble.
We place a transmitter and receiver, both designed for 1 kbps, in
random locations within two feet of each other in both of the in-
door locations. These distance are enough to include conﬁgurations
where a 1 kbps receiver can hear the transmitter, but experiences
high bit error rate (>10%). This is corroborated by the fact that the
BER observed across the tested locations is in the range of 10−4
to 0.17. The experiments are performed both in the presence and
absence of backscattering from the transmitter. We repeat the ex-
periments at 300 locations and for three different scenarios: no mo-
tion near the receiver, human motion near the receiver, and a human
holding the receiver and waving her hand in front of it.
In Fig. 10(a) we plot the CDF of the computed energy detection
values (Ds). The plot shows the following: Firstly, in the absence of

backscatter, D is exactly zero in more than 98% of the experiments.
This happens because, as described in §4.1, the analog comparator
used in the receiver, typically, outputs either a constant sequence of
ones or a constant sequence of zeros in the absence of a backscat-
tered signal. Thus, the receiver sees the same bit during a 10-bit
interval. Secondly, human mobility does not create statistically sig-
niﬁcant differences in the computed D values. This is because while
motion can change the signal strength at the receiver and the corre-

sponding bits output by the comparator, it is unlikely that it either
creates bit changes at the rate of 1 kbps or creates an equal num-
ber of bit changes in a 10-bit interval. Finally, the plot shows that
in more than 99% of the experiments there is a clear distinction
between the presence and absence of a backscattering transmitter.
We also plot in Fig. 10(b) the CDF for preamble correlation both
in the presence and absence of a packet that starts with a preamble.
The correlation values are normalized by the length of the preamble
(64). The plot shows a clear distinction between the presence and
absence of a preamble, in more than 99.5% of the experiments. This
is again because of the property of the comparator which outputs
sequences of either constant one bits or constant zero bits in the
absence of backscatter, which are unlikely to be confused with a
pseudo-random preamble.
6.4 Interference with TV Receivers
Since the backscattered signals are reﬂections of existing TV
signals, in theory, one could either synchronize ambient backscat-
ter with the TV transmissions or modulate data at a slow enough
rate that TV receivers would be immune to interference. However,
even without these constraints, the backscattered signals are weak
enough that they do not affect TV receivers except in less favor-
able conditions. In this section, we stress-test ambient backscatter
to get a sense for the upper bound of its effects on TV receivers.
To that end, we tested very small antenna-tag distances (less than
a foot) and performed the experiments inside the ofﬁce building of
location 2, which has the weakest TV signal power.7
We use an off-the-shelf Panasonic Plasma HDTV (Model No:
TC-P42G25) connected to a cheap tuner (Coby DTV102) and a
basic RCA indoor antenna (Model No: ANT111). We tune the TV
channel to the transmissions at 539 MHz. To evaluate the worst case
behavior where the transmitter always backscatters information, we
connect the transmitter to a power source and set it to continuously
transmit random bits. The transmit antenna is placed parallel to the
TV antenna to maximize the effects of backscatter on the TV re-
ceiver. The transmitter is placed at a random location one foot away
from the TV antenna. It is then moved towards the TV antenna until
we ﬁrst notice visual glitches in the video; we measure the distance
at which this happens. Note that, in digital television, interference
is relatively easy to quantize as errors result in corrupted portions of
the image, rather than just noise as is the case in analog television.
To quantify visually observable glitches, we had two users simul-
taneously looking for any momentary, visually observable artifact
(including misplaced squares of pixels) on the screen.
7Results from locations that have stronger TV signals show that the
TV receiver was more resilient to interference. The majority of the
time, there were no visual artifacts for distances above 1 in, and we
never observed any glitches for any bit rate at distances above 3 in.
Fig. 11 plots the CDF of the glitch distance for different bit rates
at the transmitter. The CDF is taken across multiple experiments.
The plots show the following:
• A 100 bps backscattering transmitter does not create any notice-
able glitches at the TV receiver unless it is less than 2.3 inches
from the TV antenna. This is because the backscattered signal
