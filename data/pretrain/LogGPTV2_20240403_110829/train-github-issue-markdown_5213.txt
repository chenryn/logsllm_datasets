I created the app by npx create-app order //not this problem Mismatching
Versions of React and React DOM and not this Duplicate React
here is my code  
First,I created a hook usePre.js which is copied from
https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#how-to-get-the-previous-props-or-state  
`import React,{useRef,useEffect} from "react"; export default function
useTest(value) { const ref=useRef(); useEffect(()=>{ ref.current=value; });
return ref.current; }`  
then I fixed the App.js to  
`import React from "react"; import useTest from "./useTest"; function App() {
const a = useTest(1); return (test); } export default App;`
and fixed the index.js  
`import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'; import App from './App'; const app = App();
ReactDOM.render( app, document.getElementById('root') );`  
then the error of Invalid hook call happened  
I don't think I have broken the hooks rules  
no call Hooks in class components.  
no call in event handlers.  
no call Hooks inside functions passed to useMemo, useReducer, or useEffect
I just use it in the root app?maybe it's the new rule?
