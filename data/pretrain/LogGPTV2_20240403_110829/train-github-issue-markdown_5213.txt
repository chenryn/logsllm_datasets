Certainly! Here is a more polished and coherent version of your text:

I encountered an issue while creating a React application using `npx create-react-app order`. The problem is not related to mismatching versions of React and React DOM, nor is it about duplicate React instances. Here is the code I have written and the error I encountered.

First, I created a custom hook called `usePre.js`, which I copied from the React documentation: [How to get the previous props or state](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#how-to-get-the-previous-props-or-state).

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from "react";

export default function useTest(value) {
  const ref = useRef();
  useEffect(() => {
    ref.current = value;
  });
  return ref.current;
}
```

Next, I updated my `App.js` to use this custom hook:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import useTest from "./useTest";

function App() {
  const a = useTest(1);
  return <div>test</div>;
}

export default App;
```

Then, I modified the `index.js` file to render the `App` component:

```javascript
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

const app = <App />;
ReactDOM.render(app, document.getElementById('root'));
```

After making these changes, I received an "Invalid hook call" error. I do not believe I have violated any of the rules for using hooks, as I am:
- Not calling hooks inside class components.
- Not calling hooks in event handlers.
- Not calling hooks inside functions passed to `useMemo`, `useReducer`, or `useEffect`.

I am only using the hook in the root `App` component. Could there be a new rule I am unaware of?
