Figure 2: Durations of ﬂows observed at 8 diﬀerent
time scale levels (from 2 days of dataset D1, ﬂows
less than 10 minutes truncated).
Figure 3: Number of ﬂows at diﬀerent time scales:
all ﬂows, median per segment, and presence ﬂows in
one segment (14 days from dataset D8).
Finally, all segment processing is done on a workstation
cluster in parallel. Segments are processed and committed
atomically (using ﬁlesystem rename as the commit method).
Concurrent processing of the same ﬁle is discouraged by tag-
ging in-process ﬁles with a ﬂag, and we recover from crashed
processing jobs by timing out ﬂags. We periodically scan the
segment tree to catch and correct any missed merges due to
races.
3.3 Managing Outages
Very few network tasks can run uninterrupted forever
without error—with power outages and scheduled mainte-
nance, continuous operation more than a few months is
good. While we tolerate several types of outages, we have
experienced multiple gaps, primarily due to software errors
in our experimental system. Since May 2009 we have taken
8 traces to date in durations of 8, 9, 15, 23, 40, 65, and 99
days. In the future we plan to bridge brief outages by com-
puting both optimistic and pessimistic ﬂow records around
a gap.
3.4 Understanding the Methodology
To illustrate how diﬀerent time scale ﬂows are stored in
diﬀerent levels of our system, Figure 2 shows the cumulative
distribution of ﬂow durations for diﬀerent levels of segments
on a linear-log scale graph. Each line shows a diﬀerent level
segment, starting with level-1 at 20 minutes and doubling
at each subsequent level.
Each level shows a range of ﬂow durations. Because of the
tail rule, all segments have some very short ﬂows. Because
there are relatively few very long ﬂows, the size of high-
level segments is dominated by shorter ﬂows. Although each
segments at level-i contain ﬂows from zero to T 2i in duration
(some of them may not be complete yet), many short ﬂows
have been pruned away for clearer view of the longer ﬂows.
In addition, each segment has a large number of ﬂows
near the segment duration limit. For example, 70% of level-
1 ﬂows are about 20 minutes long, and 57% of level-2 ﬂows
are 40 minutes long. These durations indicate ﬂows that last
the entire segment and are part of ﬂows that span multiple
segments. Their correct duration can only be identiﬁed at
higher-levels.
To show the advantage of our multi-time-scale storage,
Figure 3 shows the number of ﬂows across all ﬁles at each
level, the median for each level, and how many are valid by
the presence rule. We see the number of valid, presence ﬂows
(bottom line) per segment drops quickly—the true number
of long ﬂows is small. The median number of ﬂows plateaus
around 300k per segement because segment size is limited
by the tail rule and all ﬂows active in the last τ seconds.
Finally, the storage requirements (top line) drop exponen-
tially, although they are again limited by the tail rule. We
conclude that multi-scale storage is important to study long
duration ﬂows.
4. RESULTS
We next describe the results of our measurement system:
how do long ﬂows diﬀer from short ﬂows in their characteris-
tics and causes? Since May 2009 we have colected 8 traces.
For this paper, we focus on D1, a 2-day subset of 15-day
capture starting 27 May 2009, and D8, a 14-day subset of a
65 day capture starting 19 Feb 2010.
4.1 Characteristics of Long Flows
We ﬁrst compare ﬂow characteristics: rate, size in bytes,
and burstiness as a function of ﬂow duration. Our goal is to
understand what long ﬂows are like, and how they diﬀer from
short ﬂows. We therefore graph density plots, with darker
shades indicating more ﬂows. To quantify distributions at
each time scale, we overlay box plots for each time scale,
showing quartiles, minimum, and maximum.
Most graphs in this section are generated with time-scale
sampling: we take one level-i segment for each level (i ∈
[1, 11], omitting level 0), getting a representative sample
from a fraction of the data (Section 3.4). We then select
subset of that segment that we can guarantee full capture
(ﬂows with duration in [T 2i−2, T 2i−1]) and plot only those
ﬂows, discarding the rest. This approach implies that one
can compare frequency of some characteristic across a given
time scale (for a ﬁxed x value). However, at diﬀerent time
scales (varying x), the absolute number of shorter duration
ﬂows are underrepresented relative to longer duration ﬂows.
Figure 4 shows this diﬀerence: the left graph uses both
level-0 segments and one level-1 segment (all ﬂows), while
the right uses only one of each level (sampled), so the left
has higher absolute densities indicating more ﬂows. Al-
though time-scale sampling under-estimates the total num-

ber of ﬂows in the sampled case, it correctly reports the over-
all trend of ﬂow sizes. More importantly, it allows study of
the long-tail of long-lived ﬂows, while reducing computation
spent on the already-well-studied shorter ﬂows (computa-
tion that would otherwise overwhelm analysis). In summary,
sampling allows eﬃcient observation of the correct trends,
but not absolute density scales across durations.
4.1.1 Flow Rates
We ﬁrst look at ﬂow rate vs. duration in Figure 5. We
see that short-duration ﬂows can be quite fast, spanning 6
orders of magnitude speed. By contrast, long ﬂows are typ-
ically much slower. Quartiles show median rates are around
50 bytes/s for ﬂows shorter than 40 minutes, with a broad
distribution, while ﬂows longer than 100 minutes or longer
have medians closer to 10 bytes/s.
The slower rate of long ﬂows may be helpful for traﬃc
engineering, allowing longer time to react to long-lived but
slow-moving ﬂows. Although we see very diﬀerent rates at
diﬀerent durations, rate alone does not show which ﬂows
contribute to traﬃc. To evaluate if “slow and steady wins
the race”, we next look at ﬂow sizes across all time.
4.1.2 Flow Sizes
Figure 6 shows the ﬂow sizes (in bytes) of D8. We see a
strong correlation between ﬂow duration and total number of
bytes at a slower-than linear rate on the log-log plot. Linear
regression of median shows an exponentially increase at a
rate of 0.77 with a 0.958 conﬁdence coeﬃcient.
Although each long-duration ﬂow sends many bytes, there
are many more brief ﬂows, so in the aggregate short ﬂows
may still dominate traﬃc by bytes. Figure 7 shows the cu-
mulative number of bytes sent by all ﬂows of a two day
period in D1. (Unlike density plots, this CDF considers all
ﬂow segments of all time scales sent over the entire period.)
This graph conﬁrms that there are not enough long-duration
ﬂows to dominate Internet traﬃc. From the ﬁgure we can
observe that although the short ﬂows dominate the Internet
traﬃc (in terms of bytes), 21.4% of the Internet traﬃc are
carried by ﬂows longer than 10 minutes, 12.6% are carried
by ﬂows longer than 20 minutes, and nearly 2% are carried
by ﬂows longer than 100 minutes. Even though short ﬂows
are the majority of traﬃc bulk, optimizations to long ﬂows
can still have a signiﬁcant eﬀect. Internet Service Providers
may also be interested in this observation, since the contri-
bution of long-running but slow ﬂows supports the need to
meter service by bytes, not by peak speeds.
Prior studies of “slow but steady” tortoise ﬂows can ac-
count for signiﬁcant traﬃc [5, 6]. Having just shown long
ﬂows are slower than short ﬂows, we next consider if their
persistence makes up the diﬀerence.
4.1.3 Flow Burstiness
Burstiness measures the uniformity of traﬃc rate over
time. From Figure 9, we can observe that long ﬂows are gen-
erally less bursty than short ﬂows (linear regression of me-
