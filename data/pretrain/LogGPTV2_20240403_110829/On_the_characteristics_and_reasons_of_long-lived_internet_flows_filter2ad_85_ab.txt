### 2. Data Analysis and Processing

**Flow Durations at Different Time Scales:**
- **Figure 2:** This figure illustrates the cumulative distribution of flow durations observed at eight different time scale levels, derived from a 2-day dataset (D1). Flows shorter than 10 minutes have been truncated for clarity.

- **Figure 3:** This figure presents the number of flows at various time scales, including the median per segment and the presence of flows in one segment, based on a 14-day subset from dataset D8.

**Segment Processing:**
All segment processing is executed in parallel on a workstation cluster. Segments are processed and committed atomically using filesystem rename as the commit method. To prevent concurrent processing of the same file, in-process files are tagged with a flag. Recovery from crashed processing jobs is managed by timing out these flags. Periodic scans of the segment tree help to identify and correct any missed merges due to race conditions.

### 3. Managing Outages

Very few network tasks can run without interruption indefinitely. Power outages and scheduled maintenance often limit continuous operation to a few months. While our system tolerates several types of outages, we have experienced multiple gaps primarily due to software errors in our experimental setup. Since May 2009, we have taken eight traces with durations ranging from 8 to 99 days. In the future, we plan to bridge brief outages by computing both optimistic and pessimistic flow records around the gaps.

### 3.4 Understanding the Methodology

To illustrate how different time scale flows are stored in our system, **Figure 2** shows the cumulative distribution of flow durations for different segment levels on a linear-log scale graph. Each line represents a different segment level, starting with level-1 at 20 minutes and doubling at each subsequent level.

Each segment level captures a range of flow durations. Due to the tail rule, all segments contain some very short flows. High-level segments are dominated by shorter flows because there are relatively few very long flows. Although level-i segments contain flows from zero to \( T \times 2^i \) in duration, many short flows are pruned away to provide a clearer view of the longer flows.

Additionally, each segment has a significant number of flows near the segment duration limit. For example, 70% of level-1 flows are about 20 minutes long, and 57% of level-2 flows are 40 minutes long. These durations indicate flows that last the entire segment and are part of flows spanning multiple segments. Their true duration can only be identified at higher levels.

**Figure 3** demonstrates the advantage of our multi-time-scale storage. It shows the number of flows across all files at each level, the median for each level, and the number of valid presence flows. The number of valid presence flows per segment drops quickly, indicating that the true number of long flows is small. The median number of flows plateaus around 300k per segment due to the tail rule and the inclusion of all flows active in the last \( \tau \) seconds. Storage requirements drop exponentially but are again limited by the tail rule. We conclude that multi-scale storage is essential for studying long-duration flows.

### 4. Results

We next describe the results of our measurement system, focusing on how long flows differ from short flows in their characteristics and causes. Since May 2009, we have collected eight traces. For this paper, we focus on D1, a 2-day subset of a 15-day capture starting on May 27, 2009, and D8, a 14-day subset of a 65-day capture starting on February 19, 2010.

#### 4.1 Characteristics of Long Flows

We first compare flow characteristics: rate, size in bytes, and burstiness as a function of flow duration. Our goal is to understand the nature of long flows and how they differ from short flows. We use density plots, with darker shades indicating more flows, and overlay box plots to show quartiles, minimum, and maximum.

Most graphs in this section are generated using time-scale sampling. We take one level-i segment for each level (i âˆˆ [1, 11], omitting level 0), obtaining a representative sample from a fraction of the data. We then select a subset of that segment that we can guarantee full capture (flows with duration in [\( T \times 2^{i-2} \), \( T \times 2^{i-1} \)]) and plot only those flows, discarding the rest. This approach allows us to compare the frequency of some characteristic across a given time scale but underrepresents the absolute number of shorter duration flows relative to longer duration flows.

**Figure 4** shows the difference: the left graph uses both level-0 segments and one level-1 segment (all flows), while the right uses only one of each level (sampled), so the left has higher absolute densities indicating more flows. Although time-scale sampling underestimates the total number of flows, it correctly reports the overall trend of flow sizes. More importantly, it allows the study of the long-tail of long-lived flows while reducing computation spent on shorter flows.

#### 4.1.1 Flow Rates

**Figure 5** shows the relationship between flow rate and duration. Short-duration flows can be quite fast, spanning six orders of magnitude in speed. By contrast, long flows are typically much slower. Quartiles show median rates are around 50 bytes/s for flows shorter than 40 minutes, with a broad distribution, while flows longer than 100 minutes have medians closer to 10 bytes/s.

The slower rate of long flows may be beneficial for traffic engineering, allowing more time to react to long-lived but slow-moving flows. Although we see different rates at different durations, rate alone does not show which flows contribute to traffic. To evaluate if "slow and steady wins the race," we next look at flow sizes across all time.

#### 4.1.2 Flow Sizes

**Figure 6** shows the flow sizes (in bytes) of D8. There is a strong correlation between flow duration and total number of bytes, increasing at a slower-than-linear rate on the log-log plot. Linear regression of the median shows an exponential increase at a rate of 0.77 with a 0.958 confidence coefficient.

Although each long-duration flow sends many bytes, there are many more brief flows, so in the aggregate, short flows may still dominate traffic by bytes. **Figure 7** shows the cumulative number of bytes sent by all flows over a two-day period in D1. This graph confirms that there are not enough long-duration flows to dominate Internet traffic. From the figure, we observe that although short flows dominate Internet traffic (in terms of bytes), 21.4% of the traffic is carried by flows longer than 10 minutes, 12.6% by flows longer than 20 minutes, and nearly 2% by flows longer than 100 minutes. Even though short flows are the majority of traffic, optimizations to long flows can still have a significant effect. Internet Service Providers may also be interested in this observation, as the contribution of long-running but slow flows supports the need to meter service by bytes, not by peak speeds.

Prior studies of "slow but steady" tortoise flows can account for significant traffic [5, 6]. Having shown that long flows are slower than short flows, we next consider if their persistence makes up the difference.

#### 4.1.3 Flow Burstiness

Burstiness measures the uniformity of traffic rate over time. **Figure 9** shows that long flows are generally less bursty than short flows (linear regression of median values).

This structured and detailed analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the characteristics and behavior of long and short flows in network traffic.
