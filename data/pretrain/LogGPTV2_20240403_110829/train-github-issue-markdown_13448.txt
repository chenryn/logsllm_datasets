I would like to know where and how to view the log details, particularly when encountering an exit code 137, which indicates that the Superset container failed to start. Below are the relevant log entries:

```
File /home/superset/superset/assets/src/../backendSync.json was saved!
Done in 4.81s.
yarn run v1.12.3

'/bin/sh -c cd superset/assets && yarn --non-interactive --frozen-lockfile --link-duplicates && yarn run sync-backend && yarn run build && rm -rf node_modules && yarn cache clean'

```

Could you please provide guidance on how to interpret these logs and resolve the issue?
