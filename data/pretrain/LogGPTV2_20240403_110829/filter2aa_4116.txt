## Description:
> https://138.247.13.115
## Solution:
Trying to access the website, we get an error that the certificate provided by the server is not trusted.
If we try to bypass this with `curl -k`, we get:
```
421 Site 138.247.13.115 is not served on this interface
```
Let's inspect the certificate:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/mitre/SuperSecretHiddenService# openssl x509 -in CaddySelfSigned.crt -inform der  -text -noout
