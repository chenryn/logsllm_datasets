For comprehensive metabolomics/lipidomics analysis, analytical reliability, inter-laboratory comparability, automation, and standardization are of utmost 
importance Here, we present the newly developed quantitative MxP® Quant 500 kit-based assay for multiplexed MS/MS analysis of 630 metabolites/
lipids from 26 analyte classes in only 10 µL sample volume The assay allows standardized analysis in a variety of biological sample matrices (eg blood, 
feces, tissue) and species, including the microbiome The ready-to-use assay combines UHPLC- and FIA-MS/MS into a single workflow Automated data 
analysis of analytes and internal standards analyzed in 96-well format (blanks, QCs, standards, and samples) was performed with Biocrates’ MetIDQ™ 
software, which controls the entire workflow from sample registration to data processing and reporting For beta-testing 14 samples (NIST SRM 1950, 
6 human plasma samples, 2 human serum samples, lipemic human plasma, mouse plasma, rat plasma, mouse liver, and human feces) were evaluated 
The assay was successfully validated following EMA/FDA guidelines Absolute quantitation in biological samples was achieved using a seven-
point calibration or a one-point calibration with stable-isotope labeled internal standards The analytical accuracy and precision of the assay were 
safeguarded by three levels of QC samples We will present the analytical workflow and performance parameters, including intra/inter-batch accuracies 
and precision, and accuracy data of reference materials MetIDQ™ software enabled data processing including quality assessment and the combination 
of all results Beta-test data across 8 independent data sets across the 14 samples will be presented showing excellent accuracies and precision results, 
the basis for longitudinal robustness and inter-laboratory comparability

A New HILIC LC/Q-TOF Method for Metabolomics Analysis with Important Isomer Separation and Broad Coverage of 
Metabolite Classes
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Yuqin Dai, Agilent Technologies, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Jordy J. Hsiao
A robust and high performance HILIC LC/Q-TOF method was developed for the detection of broad classes of endogenous metabolites The 
chromatographic gradient, mobile phase pH, buffer concentration, and column temperature were optimized to achieve a baseline separation for 
10 pairs of biologically important isomers Moreover, the effect of sample salt concentration on the reproducibility of retention time (RT) and signal 
response was investigated The preliminary results showed that RT and signal response reproducibility was excellent in the presence of 80 mM 
of NaCl and 160 mM urea Phosphorylated metabolites such as sugar phosphates and nucleotides are often challenging to analyze due to their 
interactions with stainless steel in the system By incorporating medronic acid to deactivate the steel surfaces, CV values were within 02% and 
10% for RT and signal response respectively The effect of source conditions on MS response was also evaluated The results showed that gas 
temperature and nozzle voltage play a key role in altering the signal response Low temperature favored labile organic acids, while high temperature 
enhanced phosphorylated metabolites By using optimal source conditions, this method enabled the detection of broad classes of metabolites, 
including amino acids, vitamins, polyamines, carboxylic acids, sugars and sugar phosphates, nucleotides, cofactors and coenzyme A (CoA) 
derivatives This new HILIC LC/Q-TOF method clearly demonstrated a superior analytical performance in terms of the chromatographic separation, 
analytical reproducibility, and global coverage of metabolites Implementation of this method for the analysis of real-world biological samples is 
being conducted

 Introduction - Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells are used as host cells for the production of recombinant proteins The analysis of CHO cells 
is difficult , due to the time-consuming extraction methods, which can create a bias regarding the cells’ biological profile Here, we report a high-
throughput lipidomic and metabolomic analysis in ambient conditions, with minimal sample treatment, using Laser-Ablation Rapid Evaporative 
Ionization Mass Spectrometry (LA-REIMS) that allows the cell analysis in less than 10 seconds per sample Methods - LA-REIMS was performed 
on the cell pellets of five CHO-K1 genetically modified cell lines – producing different amounts of the recombinant protein adalimumab – using an 
OPO (optical parametric oscillator) and a CO2 laser, connected through a REIMS source interface to a QToF mass analyser The CO2 laser offers 
automated analysis, since it is implemented on a TECAN platform, which allows the analysis of hundreds of samples per day Results - LA-REIMS 
differentiated the five cell lines and provided many m/z values that could be of biological importance regarding the recombinant protein expression 
and proved to be a suitable technique for the fast analysis of cell pellets in ambient environment with minimal sample pretreatment The next steps 
of the current study include MS/MS analysis on the statistically significant m/z values Conclusion - LA-REIMS was used for high-throughput analysis 
of CHO cells with minimal pre-treatment It is a fast method that can provide a biological snapshot of cells in ambient conditions

A major challenge in metabolomics is identifying the full molecular structure of low-abundance small molecules Nanomolar concentrations can 
be detected by combining liquid chromatography and (tandem) mass spectrometry (LC-MS), but structural information is limited to retention times 
and (fragment) masses, which are often inconclusive Recently, infrared ion spectroscopy (IRIS) has emerged as a powerful analytical technique to 
elucidate molecular structure IRIS combines the sensitivity of LC-MS with the structural information of gas-phase IR spectroscopy and has been 
successfully applied for the identification of low-abundance biomarkers However, identification using IRIS is time consuming and relies heavily on 
reference compounds that are often not readily available Here we present an automated workflow to assist in the identification of detected features 
in an LC-MS experiment using IRIS and computational chemistry We are able to theoretically predict IR spectra for candidate molecules that can 
subsequently be scored against the experimental IR spectrum of an observed m/z feature By linking the workflow to the human metabolome 
database (HMDB), the user is allowed to specify search criteria which are used to find and generate candidate structures We benchmark the 
workflow by identifying metabolites using only their chemical formula and experimental IR spectra as input information Results show that the 
workflow is successful in scoring the correct metabolite as the best match Additionally, it assigns high scores to metabolites closely related in 
structure The latter shows the specificity of IR and the potential the workflow has in aiding the identification of unknown unknowns

Lipids are ubiquitous biomolecules essential to all life, found in every cellular type, ranging from the human body and vegetal organisms, down to 
bacteria They have many different functions in cell structuration, energy storage and signalling so they are natural biomarkers for different diseases 
like cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, lung disease, their study and quantification are then crucial Mass spectrometry 
(MS) coupled with liquid chromatography or gas chromatography is mainly used for global and specific analysis of lipids But before their analysis, 
there is an important and time consuming step of sample preparation Due to their amphiphilic properties, there are usually two types of extractions: 
liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and solid phase extraction (SPE) LLE and SPE are two very long protocols which are tedious when there are massive 
numbers of samples They can also be the source of many errors, considering the experimenter-dependant possible repeated artefacts To 
circumvent this point and increase the analytical service delivery, a TECAN robot has been acquired by MetaToul-Lipidomic facility to automate the 
sample preparation Due to the specificity of lipid extraction, the robot needs a lot of optimization This presentation will show part of adaptation we 
had to perform to validate fatty acid, neutral lipid and phospholipid profiling That was related to the precision of solvent sampling which implies new 
adjustment accuracy for each of them, adding air gap, but also to modify the speed First lipidomic’s results obtained with a complete automated 
sample preparation will be presented for liver and plasma sample

Novel analytical method for global metabolomic analysis by hydrophilic interaction/anion-exchange liquid chromatography 
tandem mass spectrometry
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Takeshi Bamba, Kyushu University, Japan
CO-AUTHORS: Kohta Nakatani, Yoshihiro Izumi, Masatomo Takahashi, Keita Sakurai, Michio Butsugan, Takeshi Bamba
Essential metabolic pathways to maintain biological activities include glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, amino acid, and nucleic acid metabolism 
All intermediate of these metabolic pathways are polar ionic compounds A profiling for these hydrophilic metabolites is the key to understand 
metabolic regulation However, it is difficult to comprehensively measure them with a single analytical run by conventional analytical method such as 
reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC), hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC), or ion chromatography (IC), coupled with mass 
spectrometry In this study, we developed a novel analytical method for global metabolic analysis using hydrophilic interaction/anion exchange 
liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC/AEX/MS/MS) To construct a practical analytical system for global metabolic analysis, we 
developed a novel amino-polymer packed column, which was composed of polymer particles with amines as functional groups The effect of the 
LC conditions on retention behaver and peak shapes of 45 representative hydrophilic metabolites was evaluated As a result, the optimized mobile 
phase was 40 mM ammonium bicarbonate at pH 98 (A) and acetonitrile (B) After cationic and zwitterionic metabolites were eluted under HILIC 
condition (t = 1-15 min, 95-40%B), almost of all anionic metabolites were eluted under AEX condition (t = 15-16 min, 40-0%B; t = 16-26 min, 0%B) Thus, 
we named this chromatographic technique “HILIC/AEX” With the optimal method conditions established, we successfully identified approximately 
200 hydrophilic metabolites from HeLa cell extracts Taking all of the present results into account, our advanced analytical system will be useful tool 
for in-depth studies on global metabolism

Dried blood spots (DBS) offer many advantages over plasma, serum, and whole blood sampling, including being minimally invasive and easy 
to collect and store DBS have been extended to applications such as therapeutic drug monitoring, pharmacokinetics, genomics, proteomics, 
lipidomics and metabolomics A novel blood collection and storage device collects an accurate blood volume, controlled through the use of 
precision glass capillaries of a pre-determined volume (274 uL per capillary) The device provides 4 x 274uL replicates from the same blood source, 
which are then transferred to a blood storage substrate all encapsulated in a controlled desiccated environment to maintain sample integrity Hence, 
the utility of the device is ideal for longitudinal metabolomic/lipidomic profiling DBS samples prepared from the device were transferred into a 
15mL Eppendorf tube (polar metabolomics), and another 15mL Eppendorf tube (lipidomics) One hundred microliters of chilled methanol was used 
to extract polar metabolites, with 100uL 1:1 butanol:methanol used to extract lipidic components Targeted polar metabolite analysis was performed 
using a Shimadzu GCMS-TQ8040 (QQQ), while untargeted lipidomics analysis was completed using a Shimadzu LCMS 9030 (Q-TOF) Hundreds 
of metabolites were detected from one dried blood spot, including: glycolytic and TCA cycle intermediates, nucleosides, sugars, fatty acids, amino 
acids, organic acids Similarly, hundreds of lipids were detected from one DBS, including classes: acyl carnitine, acylglucuronosyldiacylglycerol, 
bismonoacylglycerophosphate, cholesteryl ester, diacylglycerol, digalactosyldiacylglycerol, diacylglyceryltrimethylhomoserine, 
glucuronosyldiacylglycerol, hemibismonoacylglycerophosphate, ceramide, lysophophatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, 
monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, 
sphingomyelin, sphinganine, sphingosine, sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol, triacylglycerol

Exploring Plant Alkaloid Biosynthetic Pathways using Untargeted Metabolomics in Yeast
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Andreas Klitgaard, Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability, DTU, Denmark
CO-AUTHORS: Lars Schrübbers, Mette Kristensen, Jie Zhang, Michael Krogh Jensen and Hanne Bjerre Christensen
Plants are known producers of most potent human therapeutics as well as other industrially relevant molecules Despite this wealth of compounds, 
very few products are commercially available, because of low production levels in the plants, as well as high price of production The alkaloids 
are secondary plant metabolites that exhibit a remarkable structural diversity with several thousand alkaloids derived from a common precursor 
Many of these also exhibit pharmaceutically valuable biological activities, which makes the large-scale production using recombinant microbial 
cell factories very attractive Reconstitution of alkaloid biosynthetic pathways in a heterologous host is a proven strategy for rapid and inexpensive 
production of complex molecules Baker’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is one of the most common choices for a heterologous microbial 
host for plant metabolite production because of the abundance of available genetic tools for these organisms However, a deep understanding 
of cellular metabolism is essential for their development In this study, a Thermo Scientific ID-X mass spectrometer was used to investigate the 
cellular metabolism and to provide valuable insights into the changes associated with genetically modified biochemical reactions and metabolic 
pathways Compound annotation was aided by use of the AcquireX workflow, enabling automatic selection and generation of target lists for LC-MS/
MS analysis Data Analysis was performed using Compound Discoverer 30, allowing for easy integration of LC-MS and LC-MS/MS data, and rapid 
compound annotation using a variety of different compound databases

A key challenge in mass spectrometry (MS) untargeted metabolomics is the annotation or identification of metabolite peaks Metabolite 
identification must be performed, often manually, for each study individually which is time-consuming Thus, there is a need for new and novel 
approaches to allow rapid identification of metabolites using MS, MS/MS and chromatographic retention time (RT) data One way to address this 
bottleneck is through semi-targeted metabolomics This involves the generation of a database of authentic chemical standards – containing RT 
and MS/MS data – collected using standardised ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) 
methods Here, we present three UHPLC-MS assays designed for the analysis of analytical batches of thousands of biological samples (serum, 
urine, tissue extracts) For the analysis of serum and tissue extracts, two complementary analytical assays (HILIC, C18 reversed phase) enable large 
coverage of the metabolome and lipidome For urine, complementary HILIC and C18(aq) reversed phase assays are used The data are acquired 
applying untargeted assays and a large proportion of the detected metabolites are automatically fully annotated/identified, which allows much more 
direct biological interpretation Additional unidentified peaks are also collected and retained for statistical data analysis Across the three assays, 
we have generated a database approaching a 1000 chemical standards containing the RT, full-scan MS and MS/MS data Matching of the chemical 
standards to the biological data is performed using an automated data processing workflow All analytical methods and data processing workflows 
will be made open-source to maximise the value to the wider scientific community

Towards kit-based urinary metabolomics by GCxGC-TOFMS
PRESENTING AUTHOR: James Harynuk, Univeristy of Alberta, Canada
CO-AUTHORS: Michael D.S. Armstrong, O. Rene Arreondo-Campos, A. Paulina de la Mata
Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC-TOFMS) is a valuable tool for metabolomics research It offers vastly improved 
separation of components over one-dimensional methods, yielding purer spectra for compound identification and purer peaks for quantification 
The major challenge in using GCxGC-TOFMS for quantitative metabolomic work lies in how to reliably perform and maintain instrument calibration 
for a large number of target compounds in a cost-effective and timely manner In this pilot study, we use a group of 60 metabolites to evaluate a 
protocol for instrument calibration and for standard preparation that is easily adaptable to preparing suites of standards, potentially containing 
hundreds of analytes Ultimately this will lead to sample preparation and calibration kits for performing urinary metabolomics studies by GCxGC-
TOFMS, similar to those available for one-dimensional GC-MS

Analysis of Lipid and Fatty Acid Isomers Using a Travelling Wave Cyclic Ion Mobility Separator
PRESENTING AUTHOR: David Heywood, Waters Corporation, United Kingdom
CO-AUTHORS: Michael McCullagh, Martin Palmer, Russell J Mortishire-Smith, Johannes PC Vissers, Chris Hughes, James I Langridge
Data were collected on a research platform based upon a SYNAPT G2-Si instrument where the standard T-Wave IM device is replaced by a cyclic 
ion mobility (cIM) separator The cIM has multiple benefits: the circular path minimises instrument footprint whilst providing a longer, higher mobility 
resolution separation path; a multi-pass capability provides significantly higher IM resolution over a reduced (selected) mobility range; the device 
can be enabled for mobility separation or by-passed and the ion entry/exit array can selectively eject species The cIM device consists of a 100 
cm path length RF ion guide which provides mobility separation MS and tandem MS data were obtained on precursor and product ion separated 
lipids, respectively, followed by TOF mass measurement Unsaturated free fatty acid (FA) standards, differing in chain length and number of cis/
trans conformations, were chosen to determine the degree of IM separation required to separate lipid isomers FAs represent the simplest class of 
lipid components and are a core structural component of each lipid category In direct infusion cIM-MS measurements FAs with cis-double bond 
orientations, introduced as two component mixtures, were found to be more compact than those with trans-orientations Moreover, the cis- and 
trans-orientations for the monounsaturated FA’s were distinguishable A different number of cycles through the cIM separator were required to 
achieve a similar degree of IM separation for mono unsaturated FAs of differing chain length Unsaturated FAs with two or more double bonds, 
separated by two mid-chain carbons, could not be distinguished

Automated sample preconcentration into a (sub)microliter droplet using vision-controlled evaporation
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Paul Miggiels, Leiden University, Netherlands
CO-AUTHORS: Paul Vulto, Isabelle Kohler, Thomas Hankemeier
Analysis of volume- or biomass-limited samples, eg micro-dialysates, cerebrospinal fluid or cell culture extracts, has become essential 
for the discovery of new metabolite biomarkers This, however, faces two significant challenges: i) low limits of detection required for low-
abundant metabolites, and ii) dilution of small samples (2-5 fold response 
The highest increases in response were seen in nucleotides and other phosphorylated compounds in negative mode, as well as polyamines and 
B vitamins in positive mode This required a 9:1 blend of acetone and DMSO (negative mode) or acetone and diethylene glycol monomethyl ether 
(positive more) and neither solvent achieved this effect when used alone Other solvent blends were also tested with some success, but the effect
