### Comprehensive Metabolomics and Lipidomics Analysis

For comprehensive metabolomics and lipidomics analysis, analytical reliability, inter-laboratory comparability, automation, and standardization are of utmost importance. Here, we present the newly developed quantitative MxP® Quant 500 kit-based assay for multiplexed MS/MS analysis of 630 metabolites and lipids from 26 analyte classes using only 10 µL of sample volume. This assay allows standardized analysis in a variety of biological sample matrices (e.g., blood, feces, tissue) and species, including the microbiome.

The ready-to-use assay combines UHPLC- and FIA-MS/MS into a single workflow. Automated data analysis of analytes and internal standards analyzed in 96-well format (blanks, QCs, standards, and samples) is performed with Biocrates’ MetIDQ™ software, which controls the entire workflow from sample registration to data processing and reporting. For beta-testing, 14 samples (NIST SRM 1950, 6 human plasma samples, 2 human serum samples, lipemic human plasma, mouse plasma, rat plasma, mouse liver, and human feces) were evaluated. The assay was successfully validated following EMA/FDA guidelines.

Absolute quantitation in biological samples was achieved using a seven-point calibration or a one-point calibration with stable-isotope labeled internal standards. The analytical accuracy and precision of the assay were safeguarded by three levels of QC samples. We will present the analytical workflow and performance parameters, including intra- and inter-batch accuracies and precision, and accuracy data of reference materials. MetIDQ™ software enabled data processing, including quality assessment and the combination of all results. Beta-test data across 8 independent data sets from the 14 samples will be presented, showing excellent accuracies and precision results, providing a basis for longitudinal robustness and inter-laboratory comparability.

**P-574: A New HILIC LC/Q-TOF Method for Metabolomics Analysis with Important Isomer Separation and Broad Coverage of Metabolite Classes**
- **Presenting Author:** Yuqin Dai, Agilent Technologies, United States
- **Co-Author:** Jordy J. Hsiao

A robust and high-performance HILIC LC/Q-TOF method was developed for the detection of broad classes of endogenous metabolites. The chromatographic gradient, mobile phase pH, buffer concentration, and column temperature were optimized to achieve baseline separation for 10 pairs of biologically important isomers. The effect of sample salt concentration on the reproducibility of retention time (RT) and signal response was investigated. Preliminary results showed that RT and signal response reproducibility was excellent in the presence of 80 mM NaCl and 160 mM urea. Phosphorylated metabolites such as sugar phosphates and nucleotides, which are often challenging to analyze due to their interactions with stainless steel, were successfully analyzed by incorporating medronic acid to deactivate the steel surfaces, resulting in CV values within 0.2% and 10% for RT and signal response, respectively. The effect of source conditions on MS response was also evaluated, showing that gas temperature and nozzle voltage play key roles in altering the signal response. By using optimal source conditions, this method enabled the detection of broad classes of metabolites, including amino acids, vitamins, polyamines, carboxylic acids, sugars and sugar phosphates, nucleotides, cofactors, and coenzyme A (CoA) derivatives. This new HILIC LC/Q-TOF method demonstrated superior analytical performance in terms of chromatographic separation, analytical reproducibility, and global coverage of metabolites. Implementation of this method for the analysis of real-world biological samples is currently underway.

Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells are widely used as host cells for the production of recombinant proteins. Traditional analysis methods are time-consuming and can introduce biases. Here, we report a high-throughput lipidomic and metabolomic analysis in ambient conditions with minimal sample treatment using Laser-Ablation Rapid Evaporative Ionization Mass Spectrometry (LA-REIMS). This method allows cell analysis in less than 10 seconds per sample. LA-REIMS was performed on cell pellets from five genetically modified CHO-K1 cell lines producing different amounts of the recombinant protein adalimumab, using an OPO (optical parametric oscillator) and a CO2 laser connected through a REIMS source interface to a QToF mass analyzer. The CO2 laser offers automated analysis, enabling the analysis of hundreds of samples per day. LA-REIMS differentiated the five cell lines and provided many m/z values of potential biological importance regarding recombinant protein expression. The next steps include MS/MS analysis on statistically significant m/z values. LA-REIMS is a fast method that provides a biological snapshot of cells in ambient conditions with minimal pre-treatment.

**P-576: Reference-free Metabolite Identification by Infrared Ion Spectroscopy**

A major challenge in metabolomics is identifying the full molecular structure of low-abundance small molecules. Nanomolar concentrations can be detected by combining liquid chromatography and (tandem) mass spectrometry (LC-MS), but structural information is limited to retention times and (fragment) masses, which are often inconclusive. Infrared ion spectroscopy (IRIS) has emerged as a powerful technique to elucidate molecular structure, combining the sensitivity of LC-MS with the structural information of gas-phase IR spectroscopy. However, identification using IRIS is time-consuming and relies heavily on reference compounds. Here, we present an automated workflow to assist in the identification of detected features in an LC-MS experiment using IRIS and computational chemistry. The workflow theoretically predicts IR spectra for candidate molecules, which are then scored against the experimental IR spectrum of an observed m/z feature. By linking the workflow to the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB), users can specify search criteria to find and generate candidate structures. Benchmarking the workflow by identifying metabolites using only their chemical formula and experimental IR spectra as input information showed that the workflow successfully scores the correct metabolite as the best match. Additionally, it assigns high scores to metabolites closely related in structure, demonstrating the specificity of IR and the potential of the workflow in aiding the identification of unknown unknowns.

Lipids are ubiquitous biomolecules essential to all life, found in every cellular type, and have many different functions in cell structuration, energy storage, and signaling. They are natural biomarkers for various diseases, making their study and quantification crucial. Mass spectrometry (MS) coupled with liquid chromatography or gas chromatography is commonly used for global and specific lipid analysis. However, sample preparation is a critical and time-consuming step. Due to their amphiphilic properties, there are two types of extractions: liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and solid-phase extraction (SPE). These protocols are tedious and error-prone, especially with large numbers of samples. To address this, MetaToul-Lipidomic acquired a TECAN robot to automate the sample preparation. This presentation will show the adaptations made to validate fatty acid, neutral lipid, and phospholipid profiling, including adjustments for solvent sampling, adding air gaps, and modifying speeds. First lipidomic results obtained with a completely automated sample preparation for liver and plasma samples will be presented.

**P-578: Novel Analytical Method for Global Metabolomic Analysis by Hydrophilic Interaction/Anion-Exchange Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry**
- **Presenting Author:** Takeshi Bamba, Kyushu University, Japan

Essential metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, amino acid, and nucleic acid metabolism, involve polar ionic compounds. Profiling these hydrophilic metabolites is key to understanding metabolic regulation. Conventional analytical methods, such as reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC), hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC), or ion chromatography (IC) coupled with mass spectrometry, struggle to comprehensively measure them in a single run. We developed a novel analytical method for global metabolic analysis using hydrophilic interaction/anion-exchange liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC/AEX/MS/MS). A novel amino-polymer packed column was developed, composed of polymer particles with amine functional groups. The effect of LC conditions on retention behavior and peak shapes of 45 representative hydrophilic metabolites was evaluated. The optimized mobile phase was 40 mM ammonium bicarbonate at pH 9.8 (A) and acetonitrile (B). Cationic and zwitterionic metabolites were eluted under HILIC conditions, while anionic metabolites were eluted under AEX conditions. This method, named "HILIC/AEX," successfully identified approximately 200 hydrophilic metabolites from HeLa cell extracts. Our advanced analytical system will be a useful tool for in-depth studies on global metabolism.

Dried blood spots (DBS) offer advantages over plasma, serum, and whole blood sampling, including being minimally invasive and easy to collect and store. DBS have been extended to applications such as therapeutic drug monitoring, pharmacokinetics, genomics, proteomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics. A novel blood collection and storage device collects an accurate blood volume, controlled through the use of precision glass capillaries of a predetermined volume (2.74 uL per capillary). The device provides 4 x 2.74 uL replicates from the same blood source, transferred to a blood storage substrate in a controlled desiccated environment to maintain sample integrity. This makes the device ideal for longitudinal metabolomic/lipidomic profiling. DBS samples prepared from the device were transferred into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes for polar metabolomics and lipidomics. One hundred microliters of chilled methanol was used to extract polar metabolites, and 100 uL of 1:1 butanol:methanol was used to extract lipidic components. Targeted polar metabolite analysis was performed using a Shimadzu GCMS-TQ8040 (QQQ), and untargeted lipidomics analysis was completed using a Shimadzu LCMS 9030 (Q-TOF). Hundreds of metabolites, including glycolytic and TCA cycle intermediates, nucleosides, sugars, fatty acids, amino acids, and organic acids, were detected. Similarly, hundreds of lipids, including acyl carnitine, acylglucuronosyldiacylglycerol, bismonoacylglycerophosphate, cholesteryl ester, diacylglycerol, and others, were detected from one DBS.

**P-580: Exploring Plant Alkaloid Biosynthetic Pathways Using Untargeted Metabolomics in Yeast**

- **Co-Authors:** Lars Schrübbers, Mette Kristensen, Jie Zhang, Michael Krogh Jensen, Hanne Bjerre Christensen

Plants produce many potent human therapeutics and other industrially relevant molecules. Despite this, very few products are commercially available due to low production levels and high production costs. Alkaloids, secondary plant metabolites, exhibit remarkable structural diversity and pharmaceutically valuable biological activities, making large-scale production using recombinant microbial cell factories attractive. Reconstitution of alkaloid biosynthetic pathways in heterologous hosts, such as baker’s yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, is a proven strategy for rapid and inexpensive production. However, a deep understanding of cellular metabolism is essential for their development. In this study, a Thermo Scientific ID-X mass spectrometer was used to investigate cellular metabolism and provide insights into changes associated with genetically modified biochemical reactions and metabolic pathways. Compound annotation was aided by the AcquireX workflow, enabling automatic selection and generation of target lists for LC-MS/MS analysis. Data analysis was performed using Compound Discoverer 3.0, allowing easy integration of LC-MS and LC-MS/MS data and rapid compound annotation using various compound databases.

**P-581: Semi-targeted UHPLC-MS Metabolomic Approaches: A Way to Make Our Life Easier?**

A key challenge in untargeted metabolomics is the annotation or identification of metabolite peaks. Manual identification is time-consuming, necessitating new approaches for rapid metabolite identification using MS, MS/MS, and chromatographic retention time (RT) data. Semi-targeted metabolomics involves generating a database of authentic chemical standards containing RT and MS/MS data, collected using standardized ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) methods. We present three UHPLC-MS assays designed for the analysis of thousands of biological samples (serum, urine, tissue extracts). For serum and tissue extracts, two complementary analytical assays (HILIC, C18 reversed phase) enable large coverage of the metabolome and lipidome. For urine, complementary HILIC and C18(aq) reversed phase assays are used. Data are acquired using untargeted assays, and a large proportion of detected metabolites are automatically fully annotated/identified, allowing more direct biological interpretation. Additional unidentified peaks are also collected for statistical data analysis. Across the three assays, a database approaching 1,000 chemical standards containing RT, full-scan MS, and MS/MS data has been generated. Matching of the chemical standards to the biological data is performed using an automated data processing workflow. All analytical methods and data processing workflows will be made open-source to maximize value to the scientific community.

**P-582: Towards Kit-based Urinary Metabolomics by GCxGC-TOFMS**
- **Presenting Author:** James Harynuk, University of Alberta, Canada
- **Co-Authors:** Michael D.S. Armstrong, O. Rene Arreondo-Campos, A. Paulina de la Mata

Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC-TOFMS) is a valuable tool for metabolomics research, offering improved separation of components over one-dimensional methods, yielding purer spectra for compound identification and purer peaks for quantification. The major challenge in using GCxGC-TOFMS for quantitative metabolomic work lies in reliably performing and maintaining instrument calibration for a large number of target compounds in a cost-effective and timely manner. In this pilot study, we evaluate a protocol for instrument calibration and standard preparation using a group of 60 metabolites. This protocol is easily adaptable for preparing suites of standards, potentially containing hundreds of analytes. Ultimately, this will lead to sample preparation and calibration kits for performing urinary metabolomics studies by GCxGC-TOFMS, similar to those available for one-dimensional GC-MS.

**P-583: Analysis of Lipid and Fatty Acid Isomers Using a Travelling Wave Cyclic Ion Mobility Separator**

Data were collected on a research platform based on a SYNAPT G2-Si instrument, where the standard T-Wave IM device was replaced by a cyclic ion mobility (cIM) separator. The cIM has multiple benefits: a circular path minimizes instrument footprint while providing a longer, higher mobility resolution separation path; a multi-pass capability provides significantly higher IM resolution over a reduced (selected) mobility range; the device can be enabled for mobility separation or bypassed, and the ion entry/exit array can selectively eject species. The cIM device consists of a 100 cm path length RF ion guide, providing mobility separation. MS and tandem MS data were obtained on precursor and product ion separated lipids, followed by TOF mass measurement. Unsaturated free fatty acid (FA) standards, differing in chain length and number of cis/trans conformations, were chosen to determine the degree of IM separation required to separate lipid isomers. In direct infusion cIM-MS measurements, FAs with cis-double bond orientations, introduced as two-component mixtures, were found to be more compact than those with trans-orientations. Monounsaturated FAs with different chain lengths required different numbers of cycles through the cIM separator to achieve a similar degree of IM separation. Unsaturated FAs with two or more double bonds, separated by two mid-chain carbons, could not be distinguished.

**P-584: Automated Sample Preconcentration into a (Sub)microliter Droplet Using Vision-Controlled Evaporation**
- **Presenting Author:** Paul Miggiels, Leiden University, Netherlands
- **Co-Authors:** Paul Vulto, Isabelle Kohler, Thomas Hankemeier

Analysis of volume- or biomass-limited samples, such as micro-dialysates, cerebrospinal fluid, or cell culture extracts, is essential for the discovery of new metabolite biomarkers. This faces two significant challenges: i) low limits of detection required for low-abundant metabolites, and ii) dilution of small samples. Automated sample preconcentration into a (sub)microliter droplet using vision-controlled evaporation addresses these challenges. This method enhances the response for low-abundant metabolites, with the highest increases seen in nucleotides and other phosphorylated compounds in negative mode, as well as polyamines and B vitamins in positive mode. This required a 9:1 blend of acetone and DMSO (negative mode) or acetone and diethylene glycol monomethyl ether (positive mode), and neither solvent achieved this effect when used alone. Other solvent blends were also tested with some success, but the effect was not as pronounced.
