ing its full details, such as the CVV number. We can
also identify a cluster pertaining to 3) guides on “mak-
ing money,” or money mule recruitment. Next to these
three proliﬁc clusters, we explore the seven other clus-
ters in cash-out offerings, ordered by there relative feed-
back volume. We observe clusters with distinct offer-
ings in 4) carding tutorials, 5) PayPal accounts, 6) Visa
and Mastercard card details4 , 7) “bitcoin deals,” 8) bank
account credentials, 9) Amazon refund guides and 10)
Bitcoin exchanges, specialized in cash pay-outs. All in
all, we can observe a broad spectrum of cash-out solu-
tions being offered. They range from guides, to action-
able solutions, like PayPal or bank account access. Next,
we can discern services aimed at cashing out cryptocur-
rencies, more speciﬁcally Bitcoin, through dedicated ex-
change services. Consistent with what previous studies
showed for cybercrime forums [23], carding makes up a
big part of cybercrime components transacted on online
anonymous markets as well.
6.4 Clusters in other B2B offerings
In this section we present the best-selling clusters in the
other categories of B2B cybercrime components.
App. Prominent clusters of the App category include of-
fers for Android loggers, i.e., malicious keylogger apps,
Android bank apps, i.e., malicious banking apps, and
Dendroid, a RAT for Android.
Botnet.
Prominent clusters of botnet listings fea-
ture products and services revolving around Zeus bot-
nets, varying from tutorials, to source-code, to “turn key”
setups. We also identiﬁed offers on C&C servers and
4This cluster ressembles 1) and 2) but with a focus on Visa and
Mastercard brands. It could a priori also include gift cards.
DDoS services.
E-mail. The prominent clusters in the e-mail category
contain two types of spam lists, namely basic lists of e-
mail addresses, as well as complete databases, including
personal details to create personalized (spear) phishing
mails. In addition we ﬁnd a cluster of offerings on spam-
related services.
Exploit. Within the exploit category, the two main
themes are 1) Microsoft Ofﬁce exploits, e.g., malicious
macros, and 2) browser exploits. We also recorded a non-
trivial set of sales for Mac exploits.
Hosting. The prominent “hosting” clusters include host-
ing through VPS or CPanel-listings. We also ﬁnd a
prominent cluster on hosting of Tor-based websites.
Malware. Within the malware category, ransomware
stands out by featuring two prominent clusters. One clus-
ter revolves around the Stampado ransomware, the other
on Philadelphia ransomware. We also observed a promi-
nent cluster on miscellaneous (assistive) software tools
such as keyloggers or portscanners.
Phone. In the category of phone listings, one prominent
cluster comprises listings on bypassing security features
on phones. The other two prominent clusters offer re-
spectively hacked Vodafone accounts and lists of usable
phone numbers.
RAT. Two out of three prominent clusters in RAT list-
ings contain generic RATs. The third cluster speciﬁcally
deals with Mac OS RATs.
Website.
The website category is composed of three
distinct, prominent clusters. One cluster contains web-
site development listings. The second is predominantly
VPN-connections and/or SOCKS proxies. The third
cluster consists of compromised RDP-servers/hosts list-
ings.
Our analysis suggests that nearly all proliﬁc clusters
supply a component that matches B2B demand, but that
this supply is incomplete, in that the observed supply ful-
ﬁlls only a niche demand in each category. For instance,
we see ransomware dominating the malware category,
whereas domain expertise suggests there are, in general,
other types of malware in demand. This demand remains
mostly unfulﬁlled in online anonymous marketplaces.
One exception to the aforementioned trend is in the
“phone” category, where supply differs from the B2B de-
mand. Research suggests that the actual latent demand is
for using phones and social engineering to trick victims
into falling for a scam [11]. Yet, the supply is only ori-
ented towards setting-up the necessary phone lines. We
observed that guides and tutorials are among the promi-
nent clusters in the botnet and cash-out categories. We
however note that selling a guide is not the same as out-
sourcing a cybercrime component.
In summary, the demand for cybercrime components
is frequently met on online anonymous markets in our
1020    27th USENIX Security Symposium
USENIX Association
dataset, but the supply is highly restricted to speciﬁc
niches and the accompanied revenue is generally mod-
est.
6.5 Clusters in B2C offerings
In this section we brieﬂy present the prominent clusters
in the B2C categories – i.e., retail cybercrime.
Account. In listings that sell accounts, we observed two
main clusters that revolve around offerings for single ac-
counts to pornography websites. Next, we see a cluster
of listings selling Netﬂix and Spotify accounts, in quan-
tities between two and ten per listing.
Fake. The three prominent clusters are respectively of-
fering fake passports, fake IDs and counterfeit money.
Guide. The clustering process revealed guides in a) bit-
coin (“deals”), b) “making money” or starting a business,
and c) “scamming.”
Pirated. Miscellaneous pirated software, like the entire
Adobe software suite or pirated adult videos, and pirated
Microsoft software, e.g. Windows 7, are the prominent
clusters in pirated products.
Voucher. In the category of voucher-related listings, we
see offers for: a) Tesco vouchers, b) lottery tickets and c)
“free” pizzas, of which most are indeed discount vouch-
ers or gift cards for various pizza chains, but a few are in
fact credit card offerings, where “slices” refer to groups
of accounts.
The nature of products and services in all of the best-
selling clusters tells us that we are observing transactions
of retail cybercrime. We see that the best-selling clusters
within accounts are listings in smaller quantities, ranging
from single hacked accounts on a pornography website,
to up to ten Netﬂix or Spotify accounts. It may at ﬁrst
appear to be curious why a single user would want 10
Netﬂix accounts, but when considering the inherent un-
reliability (and short lifespan) of stolen accounts, it be-
comes clear that this demand is plausible for personal
use.
7 Discussion
In this section, we discuss our approach and results in
light of our theoretical assumptions and research design.
7.1 Validation
In earlier work, Soska and Christin [40] discuss the val-
idation of measurements on online anonymous markets.
They ﬁnd support for using feedback instances as a proxy
for sales by looking at three speciﬁc cases where ground
truth is available (due to arrests or leaks). However,
the online anonymous marketplace ecosystem has grown
quite signiﬁcantly since then - in particular, in 2017, Al-
phaBay itself grossed, on a daily basis, more than the
entire online anonymous marketplae ecosystem did in
2014.
The criminal complaint for forfeiture against the al-
leged AlphaBay founder and operator [5] estimates that
“between May 2015 and February 2017, Bitcoin ad-
dresses associated with AlphaBay conducted approxi-
mately 4,023,480 transactions, receiving approximately
839,087 Bitcoin and sending approximately 838,976 Bit-
coin. This equals approximately US$450 million in de-
posits to AlphaBay.”
The estimates coming from our scrapes yield US
$222,932,839 (and 2,223,992 transactions) for the entire
time interval (including, this time, all of the goods sold
on the marketplace). We believe the $450 million dollar
from the complaint is a slight overestimate, due to cur-
rency mixing that could result in double-counting.
On the other hand, our own estimates are on the con-
servative side. In particular, we have to ignore a small
fraction of credit card sales, due to a quirk in the way
certain purveyors of credit card numbers do their busi-
ness: A few stolen credit card number vendors list their
items in generic form, with a price of zero, instead leav-
ing the speciﬁcs in the shipping costs - presumably to
obfuscate their stocks and possibly to reduce the com-
missions imposed by the marketplace operator. For in-
stance, a listing would be for “credit card dumps,” with a
price of zero, but with shipping options for various types
of cards at various prices. Because we cannot determine
which cards are purchased, we simply conservatively ig-
nore such sales.
More importantly, as Soska and Christin point out, it
is important to repeatedly scrape online anonymous mar-
ketplaces to ensure adequate coverage [40]. This is par-
ticularly true when a marketplace is large, as the popu-
lation of items is more likely to change over small time
intervals. Our density of scrapes is lower in mid-2016,
meaning that we might have missed a number of transac-
tions occurring then.
All in all, we might be missing a non-negligible num-
ber of transactions occurring on AlphaBay; data for the
other marketplaces is more complete, as validated in the
original paper [40]. We point out, however, that these
misses are unlikely to change our analysis beyond un-
derestimating absolute sales volumes: indeed, with the
small exception of the vendors using shipping costs for
pricing, there are no speciﬁc biases in the missing data,
so that the items we have in our corpora can be taken as
a representative random sample.

7.2 Limitations
We next discuss the limitations of our study in two main
areas: ﬁrst, to what extent our data captures the com-
moditization of cybercrime and, second, the way we
mapped the offerings on these markets onto categories
of demand.
Observing cybercrime commoditization starts with
knowing where to look. Building on transaction cost
economics, we have argued that online anonymous mar-
ketplaces are the most logical place to trade cybercrime
commodities due to the nature of these transactions.
However, what seems logical from a TCE perspective
does not necessarily seem logical to the criminal en-
trepreneur. Trust in a market is to a large extent subjec-
tive. This might mean that cybercriminals turn to other
platforms with less safeguards to trade commoditized cy-
bercrime. Even when criminals do follow TCE, some
forms of commoditized cybercrime do not ﬁt well with
online anonymous markets: subscription models, afﬁli-
ate programs, services requiring a rich search interface,
or non-English offerings [26, 48] are all ill-suited to the
type of markets we are investigating here. Since we did
not study these forms of trade, our picture of commoditi-
zation is incomplete. To some extent, the same holds for
underground hacker forums, though we would argue that
many of the transactions on those forums are not actually
commoditized, but forms of contracting (see Section 2).
Another limitation relates to how we mapped criminal
demand. Successful commoditization is not just a mat-
ter of products and services being offered. These offer-
ings also need to meet a demand, as observed in actual
sales. To understand the potential demand of cybercrimi-
nals, we worked with a scope of known business models.
Building on the work of Thomas et. al. [42], we have
limited ourselves to cybercriminals who aim at making a
proﬁt. In other words, there may be cybercrime compo-
nents that are being offered and that do match cybercrim-
inal demand (e.g., for ideological or tactical purposes,
rather than ﬁnancial pursuits), yet are outside the identi-
ﬁed value chains.
8 Related work
Core elements of our paper build on or beneﬁt from re-
cent progress in related research, which we discuss here.
Different researchers have tried to grasp the evolu-
tion of criminal activity in the underground economy.
Initial work focused on underground forums [24, 36].
After the infamous Silk Road market came into exis-
tence, researchers looked closer at online anonymous
markets [8, 15] and investigated the evolution of listings
and revenue on these markets. Our study is among the
ﬁrst to explicitly leave the predominant drug listings out
of scope and focus on a different product type (cyber-
crime). Most closely connected to our work is the ﬁrst
longitudinal study on the evolution of volumes in prod-
ucts transacted across multiple online anonymous mar-
kets by Soska and Christin [40]. Other studies focused
on specialized markets or forums, for instance the stolen
data and exploit market [9, 23]. They investigated the
market for exploits - which turned out to be moderate
in size - and the cybercrime-as-a-service market, where
growing numbers of new services types were discovered.
Furthermore, researchers investigated the increase in on-
line drugs trade, speciﬁcally the B2B side of Silk Road 1
drugs offerings, and what factors determine vendor suc-
cess [8].
In addition to quantitative studies of the evolution of
online anonymous markets, our work is related to quali-
tative studies on buyers and sellers (vendors) on markets
and forums. For instance, Van Hout and Bingham [25]
looked into the buyers of drugs, and inspected the retail
side of the market, as we did. Van Buskirk et al. [43]
speciﬁcally focused on the motivation of drug buyers in
Australia to turn to online anonymous markets instead of
street dealers. They found that a cheaper price and higher
quality of the drug are important.
Earlier research into the commoditization of cyber-
crime found evidence of commoditization of a number of
speciﬁc products and services. Prominent examples are
booters [29], the Pay-Per-Install (PPI) market [13], and
exploit kit developers supplying drive-by browser com-
promise [22]. Thomas et al. [42] provided an overview
of the prominent cybercriminal proﬁt centers, based on
multiple individual value chains such as spam [34], and
clickfraud [32]. We can further identify earlier work
on the value chains behind malware [38, 44] and card-
ing [41].
Finally, our work can be tied to studies that aim to
understand how and where cybercriminals collaborate.
Leukfeldt et al. [33] investigated 40 cybercriminal net-
works using European and American police cases and in-
terviews, Soudijn and Zegers [41] use data from a seized
carding forum to unravel the collaboration between in-
volved actors and Hutchings [28] studied the concept of
co-offending in cybercrime and more speciﬁcally knowl-
edge transmission amongst cybercriminals and identiﬁed
distinct typologies of collaboration, ranging from ﬂuid
networks to real co-offending. In most cases, they found
online meeting places, such as dedicated fora and mar-
kets, as the places where to buy tools or to collaborate
with co-offenders.
9 Conclusions
We identiﬁed key value chain components that criminal
entrepreneurs might want to outsource (i.e., purchase on
1022    27th USENIX Security Symposium
USENIX Association
the market) and ordered them in ten categories. In three
of them (“javascript,” “customer service,” and “web in-
ject”), we found no offerings in the large random sam-
ple for the ground truth, not even when we searched
the whole data with speciﬁc keywords. We assume this
means there is very little, if any, commoditization of
these value-chain components. In the other categories of
cybercrime components, we found growing commoditi-
zation in terms of listings, vendors and revenue. Cash-
out is by far the largest category. Some categories see
only modest offerings and transaction volumes. Further-
more, not all offerings reﬂect the breadth of the demand.
In some categories, only niche offerings are available.
In line with what other researchers have observed for
the drugs trade on these markets, we see both B2B and
B2C transactions in the cybercrime categories. B2B and
B2C, a.k.a. retail cybercrime, turns out to be compara-
ble in revenue. Between 2011 and 2017 the revenue of
B2C cybercrime was around US $7 million, where B2B
cybercrime generated US $8 million in revenue.
