Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of the text:

I'm relatively new to Redis and Celery. Do I need to restart the Celery daemon (celeryd) and Redis every time I restart Apache? I am using Celery and Redis with a Django project hosted on Webfaction.

Thank you in advance for your help.

**Response:**

If you are running Redis and Celery as daemon processes, you do not need to restart them each time you restart Apache. 

However, you will generally need to restart these services if you make configuration changes to either Redis or Celery, as the applications are interdependent.

This version is clearer, more concise, and maintains a professional tone.
