ABSTRACT
Kleptography introduced by Young and Yung is about using an
embedded backdoor to perform attacks on a cryptosystems. At
SAC’17, Kwant et al. proposed a kleptographic backdoor on NTRU
encryption scheme and thought that the backdoor can not be de-
tected. However, in this paper we show that the user can detect
the backdoor very efficiently and hence the problem of construct-
ing a kleptographic backdoor on NTRU stays open. Moreover, we
also design a universal method to embed a kleptographic backdoor
for RLWE-based scheme, such as NewHope. Our construction is
shown to be strongly undetectable, which reveals the threats of the
kleptographic attacks on lattice-based schemes.

1 INTRODUCTION
Cryptosystem is adopted to safeguard the confidentiality of infor-
mation. However, if a cryptosystem is manipulated by a dishonest
authority, the goal of preserving secrecy will not be fulfilled as in-
tended. In reality, the network surveillance project PRISM disclosed
by Snowden and the widespread use of closed source software make
people doubt about the reliability of information security service
provider. The feasibility of implanting or detecting a backdoor in

a cryptosystem is of concerns to research communities. A back-
doored cryptosystem implemented in a black-box manner can be
disguised to be a regular cryptosystem. It can be dated back to the
mid 90’s when Young and Yung [20, 21] undertook systematic study
of Kleptography.
In the era of quantum computing, the deploying of quantum-safe
cryptosystems is on the agenda. The lattice-based cryptographic
algorithms are promising quantum-resistant candidates. Compared
to other lattice hard problems such as SVP and CVP, the LWE
proves to be more functional and practical. Later Ring-LWE(RLWE)
is introduced from ideal lattice to further increase the efficiency of a
lattice-based scheme. NewHope key exchange [2] is a leading lattice
candidate based on RLWE and has won the 2016 Internet Defense
Prize [7]. Its KEM variant [1] also has entered the second round of
NIST post-quantum project [11]. Besides LWE, NTRU-based lattice
scheme is very competitive in terms of efficiency and key size. Many
efforts have been paid on the study of theoretical and concrete
security of lattice-based cryptography, while the kleptographic
security is not extensively and systematically studied for lattice-
based setting.
Recently, some kleptographic attacks on lattice-based public-key
cryptographic schemes have appeared, such as [8, 19]. At SAC’17,
Kwant et al. [8] proposed a kleptographic backdoor on NTRU en-
cryption scheme, in which the session key for the symmetric part
of the user is first encrypted by the attacker’s public key with ECC
(Elliptic Curve Cryptography) and the ciphertext is then embedded
into the legal NTRU ciphertext in some special way. By doing so,
the attacker can recover the session key at a cost of increasing the
decryption failure probability of the original NTRU. As pointed in
[8], once the public key h is invertible in the ring Zq[x]/(xn + 1),
the backdoor can be detected. However, by the parameter choice
of NTRU [5], h is never invertible in the ring. Hence, Kwant et al.
thought their embedded backdoor could not be detected.
However, in this paper we show that a user can detect the back-
door in [8] very efficiently. We in fact present two detection meth-
ods to check if there is a backdoor or not. The first one is based
on the fact that the value of some polynomial at 1 is always zero
for the regular ciphertext but seems random for the tampered-with
ciphertext. The second one is based on the fact that for a regular
ciphertext we can recover the random polynomial r used in the

sarily invertible in the ring. By the choice of r, we can tell if there
is a backdoor or not.
We have to point out there is still some possible way to resist our
first detection algorithm for the attacker, but it seems hard to resist
our second detection. In our opinion, it seems hard to construct
a kleptographic backdoor for NTRU, which we leave as an open
problem.
Moreover, since RLWE-based cryptosystem have attracted con-
siderable attention, we also consider the kleptographic backdoor
for RLWE-based scheme. We propose a universal method to embed
the backdoor for RLWE-based scheme by letting some part of the
public key to be a ciphertext of some seed used to generate the
private key. Especially, we present an example for NewHope [1],
a famous RLWE-based public key encryption. The most difficult
thing we encounter is that the public key that we want to embed
our ciphertext into has a very small size, just 256 bits. We employ
the idea of ECC-based Diffie-Hellman key exchange scheme to over-
come this issue, different from the method before which usually
employs the encryption scheme.
Roadmap. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows.
In Section 2, we give some preliminaries needed. In Section 3, we
present our detection algorithm for the kleptographic backdoor on
NTRU in [8]. In Section 4, we present how to embed the klepto-
graphic backdoor on RLWE-based scheme, especially NewHope. A
short conclusion is given in Section 5.
2 PRELIMINARIES
The core of a klepto scheme is called a SETUP – "Secretly Embedded
Trapdoor with Universal Protection", which was defined by Young
and Yung [20, 21] as follows (with slight modification):
Definition 2.1. Let C be a publicly known cryptosystem. A SETUP
mechanism is an algorithmic modification made to C to get C′ such
that
• The input of C′ agrees with the public specifications of the
input of C.
• C′ computes using the attacker’s public encryption function
E (and possibly other functions as well), contained within C′.
The attacker’s private decryption function D is not contained
within C′ and is known only by the attacker.
• The output of C′ agrees with the public specifications of the
output of C. At the same time, the attacker can easily access
a part or the whole of the output which is needed to perform
the attack.
• Furthermore, the output of C and C′ are polynomially indis-
tinguishable to everyone (including those who have access
to the code of C′) except the attacker.
These conditions can be summarised as the consistency of input,
a PKC as a backdoor, the consistency, accessibility and indistin-
guishablility of output.
The ideas of Young and Yung was prescient. Since then kleptog-
raphy has captured much interest. Bellare et al. [3] introduced an
idea of strong undetectability used to describe the quality of such
backdoors for symmetric schemes. We modify their definition for
describing kleptographic backdoors on asymmetric schemes. In the
following we will construct a backdoor and show that it is strongly
undetectable.
Definition 2.2 (Strong undetectability). The subverted public key
encryption scheme is undetectable if for every probabilistic polynomial-
time detection adversary D who has access to public keys, plain-
texts and corresponding ciphertexts, the success probability of D
in the following experiment is negligible:
(1) The challenger C samples b ←(cid:45) {0, 1}. If b = 0, he will
run subverted algorithm; otherwise, he will run the plain
algorithm.
(2) D can encrypt messages at his will and outputs a bit b′ = 0 if
he decides the encryption scheme is backdoored, otherwise
outputs b′ = 1.
(3) D succeeds if b = b′.
2.1 Lattice-based encryption schemes
There are mainly two routes to implement a post-quantum encryp-
tion system based on lattice. One is to implement variants of NTRU
and the other is to base the system on LWE.
2.1.1 NewHope scheme. The LWE problem is commonly used as
the underlying problem when constructing a lattice-based public-
key cryptosystem, whose hardness can be based on the average-
case hardness of some lattice problem. Later RLWE was introduced
from ideal lattice to further increase the efficiency of a LWE-based
scheme, and then lots of RLWE-based cryptosystems are proposed,
such as the famous NewHope [1, 2].
NewHope is a leading lattice candidate based on RLWE and
has won the 2016 Internet Defense Prize [7]. Its KEM variant has
entered the second round of NIST post-quantum project [11]. Now
we sketch the NewHope-CPA-PKE scheme [1] as follows.

error correcting code consisting of Encode and Decode. We denote
multiplication of two ring elements by ⊛ and the noise distribution
by ψ.

2.1.2 NTRU Encryption. Hoffstein, Pipher and Silverman invented
NTRU encryption in 1996 [5], which has become one of the most
practical post-quantum public-key cryptosystems. It was standard-
ised by IEEE 1363.1 and ANSI X9.98.
We sketch the basic encryption process of NTRU as follows,
where
• the ring R = Z[X]/(X n − 1), Rq, Rp denote the rings R
modulo q and p respectively, the multiplication of two ring
elements is denoted by ⊛;
• the set of ternary polynomials Ld = L(d1, d2) contains
polynomials with d1 coefficients equal to 1, d2 coefficients
equal to −1 and the other coefficients equal to 0.
