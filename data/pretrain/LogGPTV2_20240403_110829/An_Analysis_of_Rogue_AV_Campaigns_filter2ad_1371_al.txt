Fig. 3. Latency against random worm: from worm infection time to detection time
for random scanning worm, measured as the number of worm connections leaving the
protected network prior to detection. We report results only for those environments
and scan rates where the worm was detected with 100% accuracy.
mechanism, never allowing the worm to scan more than 23 times before detec-
tion. TRW again highlights the variation between environments, allowing roughly
50 worm scans in the wireless environment before detection, but only ﬁve scans in
the enterprise environment. MRW and RBS allowed several hundred scans before
detection in the wireless environment, but were much faster in the other environ-
ments. PGD showed the most variation, allowing over 1000 scans before detection
in some scenarios in the wireless environment but detecting the worm in 30-40 con-
nections in the other environments. TRWRBS showed increasing latency as the
scan rate drops. This is due to the inﬂuence of the RBS algorithm that increases
the destination threshold as the time window increases. The fast scanning worm
is caught in a short window, but the slower scanning worms take a substantially
longer time to hit the critical number of destinations.
Across the board, TRW shows the best detection performance against ran-
dom scanning worms. This indicates that connection failures are a strong and
highly identiﬁable signal. TRW also had consistent and low latencies, limiting
the damage a worm could do. Destination pattern based detection such as MRW
and RBS typically requires greater numbers of connections for accurate identi-
ﬁcation. PGD performed adequately, but is designed to detect multiple infected
internal hosts which did not happen with the random-scanning worm.
6.3 Detector Performance against Local-Preference Worms
Having examined the baseline case using the random scanning worm, we now
investigate performance against a more advanced foe: the local-preference scan-
ning worm. The local-preference worm directs half its connections at the local
network, meaning both that it is more likely to infect multiple hosts inside the
