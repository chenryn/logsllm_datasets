When the routing table contains multiple default routes with different metrics, the TCP/IP component of 
Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 chooses the default route with the lowest metric. If the 
Chapter 5 – IP Routing 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 140 
adapters are of different speeds, the adapter with the higher speed has the lower metric by default and 
is used to forward default route traffic.  
When the routing table contains multiple default routes with the lowest metric, the TCP/IP component of 
Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 uses the default route that corresponds to the adapter that is 
the highest in the binding order. 
To prevent the problem of disjoint network unreachability, you must do the following on the ISA or VPN 
server: 
Configure a default gateway on the interface that is connected to the network with the largest number of 
routes. In most configurations of disjoint networks, the Internet is the network with the largest number of 
routes. 
Do not configure a default gateway on any other interface. Instead use static routes or dynamic routing 
protocols to add the routes that summarize the addresses of the other disjoint networks to the local 
IPv4 routing table. 
For example, an ISA server is connected to the Internet and a private intranet. The private intranet uses 
the private IPv4 address space. To configure this server so that all locations on both disjoint networks 
are reachable from the ISA server, you would do the following on the ISA server: 
Configure a default gateway on the network adapter connected to the Internet. This step creates a 
default route that points to the Internet, making all Internet locations reachable. 
Add the 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16 routes using the intranet-connected adapter as 
persistent static routes with the Route tool. This step creates the routes that summarize all the 
addresses of the private intranet, making all intranet locations reachable. 
In this example, static routes are added. You can also configure the ISA server as a RIP or OSPF 
dynamic router so that, rather than summarizing the entire private IPv4 address space, subnet-specific 
routes are dynamically added and removed from the IPv4 routing table based on the current intranet 
routing topology. To use RIP or OSPF, enable and configure the Routing and Remote Access service. 
Network Address Translation 
A network address translator (NAT) is an IPv4 router defined in RFC 3022 that can translate the IPv4 
addresses and TCP/UDP port numbers of packets as they are forwarded. For example, consider a 
small business network with multiple computers that connect to the Internet. This business would 
normally have to obtain a public IPv4 address for each computer on the network from an Internet 
service provider (ISP). With a NAT, however, the small business can use private addressing and have 
the NAT map its private addresses to a single or to multiple public IPv4 addresses. 
NATs are a common solution for the following combination of requirements: 
You want to leverage the use of a single connection, rather than connecting multiple computers, to the 
Internet. 
You want to use private addressing. 
You want access to Internet resources without having to deploy a proxy server.

How Network Address Translation Works 
When a private user on the small business intranet connects to an Internet resource, the TCP/IP 
protocol on the user’s computer creates an IPv4 packet with the following values set in the IPv4 and 
TCP or UDP headers (bold text indicates the fields that are affected by the NAT): 
Destination IP Address: Internet resource IPv4 address 
Source IP Address: Private IPv4 address 
Destination Port: Internet resource TCP or UDP port 
Source Port: Source application TCP or UDP port 
The sending host or another router forwards this IPv4 packet to the NAT, which translates the 
addresses of the outgoing packet as follows: 
Destination IP Address: Internet resource IPv4 address 
Source IP Address: ISP-allocated public IPv4 address 
Destination Port: Internet resource TCP or UDP port 
Source Port: Remapped source application TCP or UDP port 
The NAT sends the modified IPv4 packet over the Internet. The responding computer sends back a 
response to the NAT. When the NAT receives the packet, it contains the following addressing 
information: 
Destination IP Address: ISP-allocated public IPv4 address 
Source IP Address: Internet resource IPv4 address 
Destination Port: Remapped source application TCP or UDP port 
Source Port: Internet resource TCP or UDP port 
When the NAT translates the addresses and forwards the packet to the intranet client, the packet 
contains the following addressing information: 
Destination IP Address: Private IPv4 address 
Source IP Address: Internet resource IPv4 address 
Destination Port: Source application TCP or UDP port 
Source Port: Internet resource TCP or UDP port 
For outgoing packets, the source IPv4 address and TCP/UDP port numbers are mapped to a public 
source IPv4 address and a possibly changed TCP/UDP port number. For incoming packets, the 
destination IPv4 address and TCP/UDP port numbers are mapped to the private IPv4 address and 
original TCP/UDP port number. 
For example a small business is using the 192.168.0.0/24 private address prefix for its intranet and its 
ISP has allocated it a single public IPv4 address of 131.107.0.1. When a user with the private address 
192.168.0.99 on the small business intranet connects to a Web server at the IPv4 address 157.60.0.1, 
the user's TCP/IP protocol creates an IPv4 packet with the following values set in the IPv4 and TCP 
headers: 
Chapter 5 – IP Routing 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 142 
Destination IPv4 Address: 157.60.0.1 
Source IPv4 Address: 192.168.0.99 
TCP Destination Port: 80 
TCP Source Port: 1025 
The source host forwards this IPv4 packet to the NAT, which translates the addresses of the outgoing 
packet as follows: 
Destination IPv4 Address: 157.60.0.1 
Source IPv4 Address: 131.107.0.1 
TCP Destination Port: 80 
TCP Source Port: 5000 
The NAT sends the modified IPv4 packet over the Internet. The Web server sends back a response to 
the NAT. When the NAT receives the response, the packet contains the following addressing 
information: 
Destination IPv4 Address: 131.107.0.1 
Source IPv4 Address: 157.50.0.1 
TCP Destination Port: 5000 
TCP Source Port: 80 
When the NAT translates the addresses and forwards the packet to the intranet client, the packet 
contains the following addressing information: 
Destination IPv4 Address: 192.168.0.99 
Source IPv4 Address: 157.60.0.1 
TCP Destination Port: 1025 
TCP Source Port: 80 
Figure 5-9 shows how the NAT translates incoming traffic for the configuration in this example.

Figure 5-9  An example of how a NAT translates incoming traffic 
The mappings for private to public traffic are stored in a NAT translation table, which can contain two 
types of entries: 
Dynamic mappings 
Created when private network clients initiate communications. Dynamic mappings are removed 
from the table after a specified amount of time, unless traffic that corresponds to an entry refreshes 
it. 
Static mappings 
Configured manually so that communications initiated by Internet clients can be mapped to a 
specific private network address and port. Static mappings are needed when there are servers (for 
example, Web servers) or applications (for example, games) on the private network that you want 
to make available to computers that are connected to the Internet. Static mappings are not 
automatically removed from the NAT translation table. 
The NAT forwards traffic from the Internet to the private network only if a mapping exists in the NAT 
translation table. In this way, the NAT provides some protection for computers that are connected to 
private network segments. However, you should not use a NAT in place of a fully featured firewall when 
Internet security is a concern. 
Windows Vista and Windows XP include network address translation capabilities with the Internet 
Connection Sharing feature in the Network Connections folder. Windows Server 2008 also includes 
network address translation capabilities with the NAT component of Routing and Remote Access. 
Windows Server 2003 also includes network address translation capabilities with the NAT/Basic 
Firewall component of Routing and Remote Access.

IPv6 Routing 
An IPv6 network consists of multiple IPv6 subnets interconnected by IPv6 routers. To provide 
reachability to any arbitrary location on the IPv6 network, routes must exist on sending hosts and 
routers to forward the traffic to the intended destination. These routes can either be general routes, 
such as a default route that summarizes all locations, or specific routes, such as subnet routes that 
summarize all locations on a specific subnet. 
Hosts typically use directly attached subnet routes to reach neighboring nodes and a default route to 
reach all other locations. Routers typically use specific routes to reach all locations within their sites and 
summary routes to reach other sites or the Internet. Although Router Advertisement messages 
automatically configure hosts with directly attached or remote subnet routes and a default route, 
configuring routers is more complex. You can configure a router with static routes or with routing 
protocols for dynamic routes. 
Similar to IPv4 nodes, typical IPv6 nodes use a local IPv6 routing table to determine how to forward 
packets. IPv6 routing table entries are created by default when IPv6 initializes, and entries are added 
either through manual configuration or by the receipt of Router Advertisement messages containing on-
link prefixes and routes. 
IPv6 Routing Tables 
A routing table is present on all nodes running the IPv6 protocol component of Windows. The routing 
table stores information about IPv6 address prefixes and how they can be reached (either directly or 
indirectly). Before checking the IPv6 routing table, IPv6 checks the destination cache for an entry 
matching the destination address in the IPv6 packet being forwarded. If the destination cache does not 
contain an entry for the destination address, IPv6 uses the routing table to determine: 
The interface used for the forwarding (the next-hop interface) 
The interface identifies the physical or logical interface that is used to forward the packet to either 
its destination or the next router. 
The next-hop IPv6 address 
For a direct delivery (in which the destination is on a local link), the next-hop address is the 
destination IPv6 address in the packet. For an indirect delivery (in which the destination is not on a 
local link), the next-hop IPv6 address is the address of a router. 
After the next-hop interface and address are determined, IPv6 updates the destination cache. IPv6 
forwards subsequent packets addressed to the destination by using the destination cache entry, rather 
than checking the routing table. 
IPv6 Routing Table Entry Types 
IPv6 routing table entries can store the following types of routes: 
Directly attached subnet routes 
These routes are subnet prefixes for subnets that are directly attached and typically have a 64-bit 
prefix length. 
Chapter 5 – IP Routing 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 145 
Remote subnet routes 
Remote subnet routes can be subnet prefixes (typically with a 64-bit prefix length) or prefixes that 
summarize an address space (typically with a prefix length less than 64). 
Host routes 
For IPv6 host routes, the route prefix is a specific IPv6 address with a 128-bit prefix length. In 
contrast, both types of subnet routes have prefixes that have a prefix length of 64 bits or less. 
Default route 
The IPv6 default route prefix is ::/0. 
Route Determination Process 
To determine which routing table entry is used for the forwarding decision, IPv6 on an IPv6 router uses 
the following process: 
1. For each entry in a routing table, compare the bits in the address prefix to the same bits in the 
destination address for the number of bits indicated in the prefix length of the route. If all the bits in 
the address prefix match all the bits in the destination IPv6 address, the route is a match for the 
destination. 
2. Compile the list of matching routes and choose the route that has the largest prefix length (the route 
that matched the most high-order bits with the destination address). The longest matching route is 
the most specific route to the destination. If multiple entries with the longest match are found (multiple 
routes to the same address prefix, for example), the router uses the lowest metric to select the best 
route. If multiple entries exist that are the longest match and the lowest metric, IPv6 can choose 
which routing table entry to use. 
For any given destination, this procedure finds matching routes in the following order: 
1. A host route that matches the entire destination address 
2. A subnet or summarized route with the longest prefix length that matches the destination 
3. The default route (the address prefix ::/0) 
When the route determination process is complete, IPv6 has selected a single route in the routing table. 
The selected route yields a next-hop interface and address. If the sending host fails to find a route, IPv6 
assumes that the destination is locally reachable. If a router fails to find a route, IPv6 sends an Internet 
Control Message Protocol for IPv6 (ICMPv6) Destination Unreachable-No Route to Destination 
message to the sending host and discards the packet. 
On an IPv6 sending host, the entries in the routing table that are used for route determination depend 
on whether the host supports strong host send behavior. Hosts running Windows Vista, Windows XP, 
Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2003 support strong host sends. For more information, see 
Strong and Weak Host Models.

The route type. Routes that user applications configure have the route type of Manual. Routes that the 
IPv6 protocol configures have the route type of Autoconf.  
A metric used to select between multiple routes with the same prefix. The lowest metric is the most 
desirable closest matching route. 
The prefix.  
The interface index, which indicates the interface over which packets matching the address prefix are 
reachable.  
You can view the interface indexes from the display of the netsh interface ipv6 show interface 
command.
