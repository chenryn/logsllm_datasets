Abstract 
This paper presents the experiences of using a symbolic 
model  checker  to  check  the  safety  properties  of  a  servo-
loop control system.  Symbolic model checking has been 
shown  to  be  beneficial  when  the  system  under  analysis 
can  be  modeled  as  a  finite  state  machine.        Servo-loop 
control  systems  are  typically  represented  by  differential 
equations  (Laplace  transforms)  –  not  as  finite  state 
machines.   However, the control loop is only a part of the 
software system needed to properly and safely operate the 
system.   This paper first validates the safety of the servo 
loop using control theory and simulation.  Then, a simple 
state  model  of  a  servo  loop  is  combined  with  the  state 
model of entire system.   This model is then entered into a 
model checker (SMV) along with safety predicates.  The 
model  checker  is  used  to  validate  the  safety  predicates.     
This  paper  shows  via  a  concrete  example  that  safety 
issues can be discovered and defined for control systems 
using a model checker.  Furthermore, it demonstrates that 
effective hazard analysis may require multiple techniques. 
1.  Introduction 
This paper describes the modeling and analysis of the 
software  for  an  antenna  tracking  system.    Real-time, 
event-driven systems are not obvious candidates for finite 
state modeling.   At first glance, their continuous range of 
operation does not appear to map to a manageable set of 
states.      However,  by  viewing  the  system  from  a  single 
perspective,  in  this  case  safety,  discrete  states  can  be 
identified.    The  critical  safety  aspect  is  how  fast  the 
antenna is moving near a physical limit.    
This  paper  provides  an  example  of  how  a  model 
checker,  combined  with  traditional  methods,  can  analyze 
the safety of a complex system.  The technique requires 
identifying states from the perspective of this aspect – not 
from the system’s general operation.   
2.  Safety 
The 
term  safety  as  used  in  this  paper  follows 
the  freedom  from 
Leveson’s  [LEV95]  definition: 
accidents  or  losses.    Accidents,  according  to  Levenson, 
result from hazards.   Levenson defines hazards as: a state 
or set of conditions of a system that, together with other 
conditions  in  the  environment  of  the  system,  will  lead 
inevitably to an accident. 
Tracking  antenna  systems  use  very  powerful  motors 
that  can  damage  or  destroy  the  gears,  pedestal,  motors, 
cabling,  dish,  and  all  other  system  components.    The 
objective  is  to  verify  safety  through the management of 
hazards.      Antenna  system  domain  experts  know  many 
common  hazards. 
  The  design  created  during 
the 
specification process can create additional hazards.   
3.  Methodology 
the  models  show  desired 
The  technique  employed  is  to  describe  the  system  to 
extract the hazards, architect a solution that addresses the 
hazards,  test  for  them  (by  analysis),  and  refine  the 
solution  until 
response.   
Different  hazards  will  require  different  models.    In  this 
paper, both a control model and symbolic model are used. 
Hazard  detection  and  prevention  should  map  directly 
to  a  software  artifact.      Often  this  can  be  packaged  in 
safety kernels.  Rushby [RUS89] defines a safety kernel 
as  a 
that 
guarantees safety.

4.  Tracking Antenna Systems 
Tracking  antenna  systems  are  used  to  continuously 
communicate with spacecraft that change position relative 
to  the  antenna.      Antennas  move  in  two  axes  – azimuth 
and elevation.   These axes are analogous to the angles of 
a 3D polar coordinate system.  
The antenna is positioned by a motor and gear set for 
each  axis.    The  motors  are  powered  by  a  motor  control 
system  employing  a  negative  feed-back  SCR  amplifier.   
The motor control system translates an input voltage into 
a  constant  angular  rate.    Feed-back  is  provided  by  a 
tachometer.    
A  significant  hazard  that  this  system  possesses  is 
called “open-loop.”   In the event that the feedback from 
the  tachometer  becomes  disconnected  or  broken,  the 
negative input of the amplifier will float.  The result is the

motor  will  be  driven  at  full  speed  until  something 
catastrophic happens to stop it. 
The range of motion of each axis is divided into ranges 
–  operating,  limit,  emergency  limit,  and  stop  (Figure  1).  
There  is  a  set  of  hardware  interlocks  to  guard  against 
leaving the operating range.  These interlocks are usually 
ineffective  in  preventing  damage  to  the  antenna  in  an 
open loop situation.   For conditions other than open loop, 
they  work  well  in  preventing  severe  damage  to  the 
antenna.  However, they do not mitigate all hazards.

of movement for each axis.  
The  interlocks  are  two  sets  of  switches  at  either 
extreme  of  each  axis.      The  first  switch  is  referred  to  as 
the  limit  switch.    It  prevents  the  motor  control  system 
from applying power to drive the motor further into limits 
(Figure 2) effectively applying an inductive break.  It also 
sets a software accessible flag.  Upon entering a limit, the 
antenna  must  be  moved  several  degrees  back  into  the 
operational  range  before  the  limit  indicator  is  off.    No 
damage to the system occurs as a result of being in limits.  
However  it  is  good  practice  to  operate  with  sufficient 
safety margin by staying out of limits. 
The next set of switches,  Emergency  Limits, shuts all 
power  off  to  both  motors  and  the  SCR  amplifiers  and 
causes  brakes  to  be  applied  to  stop  the  antenna.      This 
situation  is  exited  only  by  manual  intervention.    The 
brakes  must  be  disabled  manually  and  the  antenna 
manually cranked out of limits.  To prevent the antenna 
from becoming active once the antenna is returned to the 
operational range, the maintenance worker can place the 
antenna in  Safe mode via the Run/Safe toggle switch.  If 
she/he fails to perform this step, the antenna can become 
immediately active resulting in severe injury or death.

Figure 2 Limit switches operating positions.  
Throwing the run/safe switch to safe causes all power 
to be removed to the  motors, SCR amplifier, and brake 
solenoids.   If the motor is moving at quick rate it comes 
to  an  abrupt  halt  significantly  stressing  the  mechanical 
components.  Furthermore, when the switch is returned to 
the  run  position,  a  high  reference  voltage  on  the  SCR 
amplifier  will  cause  the  antenna  to  accelerate  very 
rapidly, stressing its mechanical components. 
The antenna utilizes anti-lash drive gears.   These are 
two sets of gear plates connected with very strong springs 
along  a  common  axis.      The  anti-lash  gears prevent any 
play  or  slop  in  the  drive  train.      These  gears  can  be 
damaged over time (along with other components of the 
system)  due  to  oscillations  in  the  reference  voltage  that 
results in the antenna “bouncing.”   
The  control  implementation  for  motor  positioning 
utilizes  a  servo  loop.      A  servo  loop  computes  the  error 
between the desired position and the actual position and 
produces  an  output  to  eliminate  the  error.    For  the 
tracking  system,  the  desired  position  is  an  azimuth  and 
elevation  pair.      The  actual  position  is  read  from  the 
antenna.      The  servo  loop  computes  the  error  and 
produces  an  appropriate  reference  voltage  (Figure  3).  
This  loop  is  implemented  in  software  and  all  indicators, 
controls, and status are available to the software.

5.  Hazards 
From  the  description  of  the  tracking  antenna  system,  we 
can  create  the  list  of  hazards  shown  in  Table  1.    As 
Leveson [LEV95] points out, safety should be analyzed at 
a  system  and  environment  level.    To  borrow  a  phrase 
from  the  environmentalist  movement,  we  plan  to  “think 
globally  and  act  locally.”        Hazards  will  be  analyzed  at 
the  highest  levels  but  protection  placed  at  the  lowest 
appropriate level. 
The  static  UML  object  model  for  the  entire  system  is 
shown in  Figure  4.      Hardware  objects  are  denoted  with 
the  stereotype  “hardware,”  the  remaining  objects  are 
software.    Each  of  these  software  objects  will  be  model 
and  analyzed  for  safety  against  the  hazards  list.    This 
analysis  will  determine  specific  functionality  required  in 
each object.    
The behavior of each object is also modeled as finite 
state  machines.    Dynamic  system  behavior  is  model 
through  use  case and collaboration diagrams.   Both the 
static and dynamic models are updated based on analysis.

7.  Control Theory and Simulation 
As  described  by  Dorf  [DOR81],  dynamic  control 
systems  can  be  represented  by  a  set  of  simultaneous 
differential  equations.      Through  the  use  of  the  Laplace 
transform,  the  problem  is  reduced  to  a  set  of  linear 
algebraic  equations.    This  is  done  by  using  a  block 
diagram of the system.  Each block contains the transfer 
equation that relates its inputs to its outputs.  The various 
pieces  of  the  control  circuit  are  assembled  in  a  block 
diagram.   Analysis is then performed on this model. 
The  first  block  is  the  Antenna  System.      For  a 
the  Laplace 
torque-speed  control  system 
linearized 
transform for the transfer function is  
(s)/Vm(s) = Gm/(t ms+1)  
Where 
(Eq. 1) 
(s) := the angular velocity  
Vm (s) := the input voltage 
Gm := gain of the motor control 
t m := time constant of motor control. 
s = d/dt 
1/s = ? dt | 0+ to t  
(Eq. 2) 
(Eq. 3) 
and 
The antenna system’s output is actually position – not 
rate  –  as  viewed  from  the  servo  loop.    Therefore  Eq.  1 
becomes after applying the integrator 1/s (see Eq. 3): 
 Where 
q (s)/Vm(s) = Ga/s(t ms+1)

The final loop using control transfer blocks is shown in 
Figure  7.    The  simulation  of  this  control  loop  along with 
the simple loop is shown in Figure  6.  These demonstrate 
the effectiveness of the hazard mitigation.  Furthermore, if 
the control loop equation is solved using typical values, 
there  are  only  positive  coefficients  in  the  denominator, 
therefore  by  the  Routh-Hurwitz  theorem,  there  are  no 
positive roots.    This means the system is stable.

Figure  5  shows  a  very  simple  model.    The  difference 
between the desired positions q d(s) and the actual position

antenna system.   E(s) will be truncated to fall within the 
minimum and maximum input range
