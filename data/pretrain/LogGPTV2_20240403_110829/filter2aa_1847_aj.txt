server sends the mail to the computer specified in the MX record.
name server  See DNS (Domain Name System).
NAT (Network Address Translation)  A method of connecting multiple computers          
to the Internet (or any other IP network) using one IP address. NAT converts the IP 
addresses you assign to computers on your private, internal network into one 
legitimate IP address for Internet communications. 
network interface  Your computer’s hardware connection to some network. This 
includes (but is not limited to) Ethernet connections, Airport cards, and FireWire 
connections.
node  A processing location. A node can be a computer or some other device, such as 
a printer. Each node has a unique network address.
NTP (network time protocol)  A network protocol used to synchronize the clocks of 
computers across a network to some time reference clock. NTP is used to ensure that 
all the computers on a network are reporting the same time.
Open Directory  The Apple directory services architecture, which can access 
authoritative information about users and network resources from directory domains 
that use LDAP, NetInfo, or Active Directory protocols; BSD configuration files; and 
network services.
open relay  A server that receives and automatically forwards mail to another server. 
Junk mail senders exploit open relay servers to avoid having their own mail servers 
blacklisted as sources of spam.
packet  A unit of data information consisting of header, information, error detection, 
and trailer records. QTSS uses TCP, UDP, and IP packets to communicate with streaming 
clients.

port  A sort of virtual mail slot. A server uses port numbers to determine which 
application should receive data packets. Firewalls use port numbers to determine 
whether or not data packets are allowed to traverse a local network. “Port” usually 
refers to either a TCP or UDP port. 
protocol  A set of rules that determines how data is sent back and forth between two 
applications. 
PTR (pointer) record  A DNS record type that translates IP (IPv4) addresses to domain 
names. Used in DNS reverse lookups.
QTSS (QuickTime Streaming Server)  A technology that lets you deliver media over the 
Internet in real time.
record type  A specific category of records, such as users, computers, and mounts. For 
each record type, a directory domain may contain any number of records.
recursion  The process of fully resolving domain names into IP addresses. A 
nonrecursive DNS query allows referrals to other DNS servers to resolve the address. In 
general, user applications depend on the DNS server to perform this function, but 
other DNS servers do not have to perform a recursive query.
Rendezvous  A protocol developed by Apple for automatic discovery of computers, 
devices, and services on IP networks. This proposed Internet standard protocol is 
sometimes referred to as “ZeroConf” or “multicast DNS.” For more information, visit 
www.apple.com or www.zeroconf.org.
scope  A group of services. A scope can be a logical grouping of computers, such as all 
computers used by the production department, or a physical grouping, such as all 
computers located on the first floor. You can define a scope as part or all of your 
network.
search path  See search policy.
search policy  A list of directory domains searched by a Mac OS X computer when it 
needs configuration information; also the order in which domains are searched. 
Sometimes called a search path.
shared secret    A value defined at each node of an L2TP VPN connection that serves as 
the encryption key seed to negotiate authentication and data transport connections.
slave zone  The DNS zone records held by a secondary DNS server. A slave zone 
receives its data by zone transfers from the master zone on the primary DNS server.

Glossary    
SLP (Service Location Protocol) DA (Directory Agent)  A protocol that registers 
services available on a network and gives users easy access to them. When a service is 
added to the network, the service uses SLP to register itself on the network. SLP/DA 
uses a centralized repository for registered network services.
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)  A protocol used to send and transfer mail. Its 
ability to queue incoming messages is limited, so SMTP usually is used only to send 
mail, and POP or IMAP is used to receive mail.
spam  Unsolicited email; junk mail.
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)  An Internet protocol that allows you to send encrypted, 
authenticated information across the Internet.
static IP address  An IP address that is assigned to a computer or device once and is 
never changed. 
Stratum 1  An Internet wide, authoritative Network Time Protocol (NTP) server that 
keeps track of the current UTC time. Other stratums are available (2, 3, and so forth); 
each takes its time from a lower-numbered stratum server.
subnet  A grouping on the same network of client computers that are organized by 
location (different floors of a building, for example) or by usage (all eighth-grade 
students, for example). The use of subnets simplifies administration.
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)  A method used along with the Internet Protocol 
(IP) to send data in the form of message units between computers over the Internet. IP 
takes care of handling the actual delivery of the data, and TCP takes care of keeping 
track of the individual units of data (called packets) into which a message is divided for 
efficient routing through the Internet. 
TTL (time-to-live)  The specified length of time that DNS information is stored in a 
cache. When a domain name–IP address pair has been cached longer than the TTL 
value, the entry is deleted from the name server’s cache (but not from the primary DNS 
server).
TXT (text) record  A DNS record type that stores a text string for a response to a DNS 
query.
UCE (unsolicited commercial email)  See spam.

UDP (User Datagram Protocol)  A communications method that uses the Internet 
Protocol (IP) to send a data unit (called a datagram) from one computer to another in a 
network. Network applications that have very small data units to exchange may use 
UDP rather than TCP.
unicast  The one-to-one form of streaming. If RTSP is provided, the user can move 
freely from point to point in an on-demand movie. 
UTC (universal time coordinated)  A standard reference time. UTC is based on an 
atomic resonance, and clocks that run according to UTC are often called “atomic 
clocks.”
VPN (Virtual Private Network)  A network that uses encryption and other technologies 
to provide secure communications over a public network, typically the Internet. VPNs 
are generally cheaper than real private networks using private lines but rely on having 
the same encryption system at both ends. The encryption may be performed by 
firewall software or by routers.
WAN (wide area network)  A network maintained across geographically separated 
facilities, as opposed to a LAN (local area network) within a facility. Your WAN interface 
is usually the one connected to the Internet.
wildcard  A range of possible values for any segment of an IP address.
WINS (Windows Internet Naming Service)  A name resolution service used by 
Windows computers to match client names with IP addresses. A WINS server can be 
located on the local network or externally on the Internet.
zone transfer  The method by which zone data is replicated among authoritative DNS 
servers. Slave DNS servers request zone transfers from their master servers to acquire 
their data.
