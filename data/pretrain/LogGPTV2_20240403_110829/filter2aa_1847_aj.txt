### Glossary

**Mail Delivery via MX Record**
- **Description**: The server sends the email to the computer specified in the MX (Mail Exchange) record.

**Name Server**
- **See Also**: DNS (Domain Name System)

**NAT (Network Address Translation)**
- **Description**: A method for connecting multiple computers to the Internet (or any other IP network) using a single IP address. NAT converts the private IP addresses assigned to devices on your internal network into a public IP address for external communications.

**Network Interface**
- **Description**: The hardware connection on your computer that allows it to connect to a network. This includes, but is not limited to, Ethernet connections, Wi-Fi (e.g., Airport cards), and FireWire connections.

**Node**
- **Description**: A processing location, such as a computer or other device (e.g., a printer). Each node has a unique network address.

**NTP (Network Time Protocol)**
- **Description**: A protocol used to synchronize the clocks of computers across a network to a reference clock. NTP ensures that all computers on a network report the same time.

**Open Directory**
- **Description**: Apple's directory services architecture, which can access authoritative information about users and network resources from various directory domains using protocols like LDAP, NetInfo, or Active Directory, BSD configuration files, and network services.

**Open Relay**
- **Description**: A mail server that receives and automatically forwards email to another server. Spammers often exploit open relay servers to avoid having their own mail servers blacklisted as sources of spam.

**Packet**
- **Description**: A unit of data information consisting of header, payload, error detection, and trailer records. QTSS uses TCP, UDP, and IP packets to communicate with streaming clients.

**Port**
- **Description**: A virtual endpoint for communication. Servers use port numbers to determine which application should receive data packets. Firewalls use port numbers to control whether data packets are allowed to traverse a local network. "Port" usually refers to either a TCP or UDP port.

**Protocol**
- **Description**: A set of rules that determines how data is sent back and forth between two applications.

**PTR (Pointer) Record**
- **Description**: A DNS record type that translates IP (IPv4) addresses to domain names. Used in DNS reverse lookups.

**QTSS (QuickTime Streaming Server)**
- **Description**: A technology that enables real-time media delivery over the Internet.

**Record Type**
- **Description**: A specific category of records, such as users, computers, and mounts. For each record type, a directory domain may contain any number of records.

**Recursion**
- **Description**: The process of fully resolving domain names into IP addresses. A non-recursive DNS query allows referrals to other DNS servers to resolve the address. User applications typically rely on the DNS server to perform this function, while other DNS servers do not have to perform a recursive query.

**Rendezvous**
- **Description**: A protocol developed by Apple for automatic discovery of computers, devices, and services on IP networks. This proposed Internet standard protocol is sometimes referred to as "ZeroConf" or "multicast DNS." For more information, visit [www.apple.com](http://www.apple.com) or [www.zeroconf.org](http://www.zeroconf.org).

**Scope**
- **Description**: A group of services. A scope can be a logical grouping of computers, such as all computers used by the production department, or a physical grouping, such as all computers located on the first floor. You can define a scope as part or all of your network.

**Search Path**
- **See Also**: Search Policy

**Search Policy**
- **Description**: A list of directory domains searched by a Mac OS X computer when it needs configuration information, along with the order in which these domains are searched. Sometimes called a search path.

**Shared Secret**
- **Description**: A value defined at each node of an L2TP VPN connection that serves as the encryption key seed to negotiate authentication and data transport connections.

**Slave Zone**
- **Description**: The DNS zone records held by a secondary DNS server. A slave zone receives its data through zone transfers from the master zone on the primary DNS server.

**SLP (Service Location Protocol) DA (Directory Agent)**
- **Description**: A protocol that registers services available on a network and provides easy access to them. When a service is added to the network, it uses SLP to register itself. SLP/DA uses a centralized repository for registered network services.

**SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**
- **Description**: A protocol used to send and transfer email. Its ability to queue incoming messages is limited, so SMTP is typically used only to send mail, while POP or IMAP is used to receive mail.

**Spam**
- **Description**: Unsolicited email; junk mail.

**SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)**
- **Description**: An Internet protocol that allows encrypted, authenticated information to be sent across the Internet.

**Static IP Address**
- **Description**: An IP address that is assigned to a computer or device once and is never changed.

**Stratum 1**
- **Description**: An authoritative Network Time Protocol (NTP) server that keeps track of the current UTC time. Other stratums (2, 3, etc.) take their time from lower-numbered stratum servers.

**Subnet**
- **Description**: A grouping of client computers on the same network, organized by location (e.g., different floors of a building) or usage (e.g., all eighth-grade students). The use of subnets simplifies administration.

**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**
- **Description**: A method used along with the Internet Protocol (IP) to send data in the form of message units between computers over the Internet. IP handles the actual delivery of the data, while TCP manages the individual units of data (called packets) for efficient routing through the Internet.

**TTL (Time-to-Live)**
- **Description**: The specified length of time that DNS information is stored in a cache. When a domain name–IP address pair has been cached longer than the TTL value, the entry is deleted from the name server’s cache (but not from the primary DNS server).

**TXT (Text) Record**
- **Description**: A DNS record type that stores a text string for a response to a DNS query.

**UCE (Unsolicited Commercial Email)**
- **See Also**: Spam

**UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**
- **Description**: A communications method that uses the Internet Protocol (IP) to send a data unit (called a datagram) from one computer to another in a network. Network applications that exchange very small data units may use UDP rather than TCP.

**Unicast**
- **Description**: The one-to-one form of streaming. If RTSP is provided, the user can move freely from point to point in an on-demand movie.

**UTC (Universal Time Coordinated)**
- **Description**: A standard reference time based on atomic resonance. Clocks that run according to UTC are often called "atomic clocks."

**VPN (Virtual Private Network)**
- **Description**: A network that uses encryption and other technologies to provide secure communications over a public network, typically the Internet. VPNs are generally cheaper than real private networks using private lines but rely on having the same encryption system at both ends. Encryption may be performed by firewall software or routers.

**WAN (Wide Area Network)**
- **Description**: A network maintained across geographically separated facilities, as opposed to a LAN (local area network) within a facility. Your WAN interface is usually the one connected to the Internet.

**Wildcard**
- **Description**: A range of possible values for any segment of an IP address.

**WINS (Windows Internet Naming Service)**
- **Description**: A name resolution service used by Windows computers to match client names with IP addresses. A WINS server can be located on the local network or externally on the Internet.

**Zone Transfer**
- **Description**: The method by which zone data is replicated among authoritative DNS servers. Slave DNS servers request zone transfers from their master servers to acquire their data.
