# Bug report
## Describe the bug
If SSR occurs on a page with scss imports, client-side routing works fine. If
the SSR page does not include any scss imports, client-side routing then does
not take place.
## To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
  1. Clone and run example repo: https://github.com/kinetifex/next-sass-routing-bug
  2. Browse to http://localhost:3000/
  3. Click on `With SCSS import` link
  4. Notice route does not change and no errors present. 
    * Also note there is no `.css` downloaded in Network tab
When it works:
  1. Run example app
  2. Browse to http://localhost:3000/with-scss
    * The `.css` file will download in Network tab
  3. Click on `Index` link
  4. Click on `With SCSS import` link
  5. Notice it works this time.
## Expected behavior
Routing to pages with scss imports should work.
## System information
  * OS: macOS
  * Browser: chrome, firefox, safari
  * Version of Next.js: 7.0.2
## Additional context
This is using `@zeit/next-sass` plugin, though I believe the error to be
next.js related, possibly with `_document.js`
