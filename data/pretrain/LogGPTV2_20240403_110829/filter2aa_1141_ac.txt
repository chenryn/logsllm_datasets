### 4.5.1 Sensor Behavior

Door and motion sensor behavior can be distinguished by their transmission types. A door opening is indicated by a transmission of type `0xA0`, while a door closing is indicated by `0x80`. If a `0x80` transmission is followed by a `0x00` transmission, it signifies the activation of a motion detector. It's important to note that some motion detectors are designed to conserve power and will only transmit an event once every three minutes, whereas door sensors will transmit for every event.

### 4.5.2 Home Layout

The placement of sensors in a home is generally logical and prioritized. Most homes have fewer than a dozen sensors, typically located in high-value and high-traffic areas. For example, if a home has only one motion detector, it is likely placed in a path that must be traversed to access the bedroom, which is considered the most valuable room. If multiple motion detectors are present, their activity patterns can help identify their locations. The motion detector protecting the bedroom is likely the last one to transmit before a sleep cycle, while those in the living or dining rooms will transmit more frequently throughout the day. Door sensors are usually installed on all doors that provide access to the interior, including the garage. A door sensor that transmits around the time a resident leaves for work is likely the one closest to the garage.

### 4.5.3 Multiple Residents

By analyzing the aggregate information from the system, we can determine when the residence is occupied and unoccupied. Deviations from normal behavior, such as an emergency situation or a large gathering, can also be detected. To differentiate between residents, additional intelligence is required, which is an area for future research.

### 4.6 Replay Attacks

A replay attack involves intercepting a transmission and then retransmitting it to achieve the original intent. This can be implemented using the GNU Radio Companion (GRC) with a flow chart that uses the captured file as the source and the USRP as the sink. The flow chart is the inverse of the SIGINT raw RF transmission capture, as shown in Figure 9.

Replay attacks are particularly effective against the Honeywell system, allowing an adversary to create false alarms when the system is armed. By causing false alarms at multiple protected areas, the monitoring company can be forced to misallocate resources. When targeting occupants, the adversary can trigger specific sensors, such as the basement door or hallway to the bedroom, to influence occupant behavior. This level of influence requires detailed knowledge of the occupants and the protected area.

### 5. Applying the Methodology

We now apply our methodology to two additional systems. The first system, detailed in section 4, allows the adversary complete control over the Honeywell system and full monitoring capability.

#### 5.1 ADT System

The ADT system consists of 4 door sensors, 3 glass break sensors, 1 motion detector, and a keypad control panel, all manufactured by DSC. The primary difference from the Honeywell system is the more advanced control panel, which acts as both the keypad and control panel, reducing hardware requirements. The system communicates over GSM, making it completely wireless. It was installed less than a year ago by ADT.

All sensor communications can potentially be jammed and intercepted. The spot jammer was very effective, providing the adversary with covert infiltration and exfiltration capabilities. We attempted to enable RF Jam on the panel but were unable to acquire the required installer code per ADT’s policy. The changes to the SIGINT flow charts include changing the center frequency to 433.92 MHz and removing Manchester decoding. All SIGINT primitives were implemented, though the final reverse engineering effort was not completed due to time constraints. The protocol format can be found in the FCC documentation for FCCID F5300NB912 [FCC 2014], as shown in Figure 11. With minimal effort, the adversary would have full monitoring capability.

Replay attacks are also effective, allowing the adversary to cause false alarms and induce behavior.

#### 5.2 2GIG System

The 2GIG system is the most interesting, consisting of 4 wired door sensors, 1 wired motion detector, 1 12V control panel, 1 wireless 2GIG door sensor, 1 Go!Control Panel, and 1 2GIG takeover module. The system appears to be a new wireless system retrofitted onto an older wired system, installed in a new house completed in 2014. 2GIG equipment, including the Go!Control panel, is used by Vivint.

As shown in Figure 12, this system’s topology is different from the previous systems. It is the only system with sensors wired directly to an alarm device capable of alerting the monitoring company. However, the alarm device is not used for this purpose; instead, it aggregates the wires and presents them to the takeover module, which converts the wired transmissions into vulnerable, wireless transmissions. This makes the system equivalent to the other two but with fewer points of failure, as the wireless transmissions of five sensors radiate from one takeover module.

No changes were made to the jamming implementations, and the spot jammer was very effective, providing the adversary with covert infiltration and exfiltration capabilities. Periodic jamming worked effectively with an on time of 50 seconds and off time of 0.20 seconds. No changes were made to the SIGINT implementations, and despite slight differences in packet contents, the adversary still has full monitoring capabilities. No changes were made to the replay implementation, giving the adversary the capability to cause false alarms and induce behavior.

### 6. Observations

The attack primitives are effective against all three systems, despite differences in graph topology, hardware, and communication protocols. Several likely explanations include:

#### 6.1 Simple Protocols

In each system, the alarm devices implicitly trust sensor communications and cannot query the origin of the transmission. The protocols are similar to legacy protocols like Modbus, which lack authorization and security against interception. Each system also uses the same packet sequences for supervision and alert messages, likely to reduce implementation costs.

#### 6.2 Legacy Technology

From FCC documentation, Honeywell has used the same Manchester encoded OOK scheme since at least 1998, and Digital Security Controls (ADT system) has used the same protocol since at least 2000. 2GIG adopted a communication stack similar to Honeywell’s. Once a component is used long enough in a process, it is difficult to replace.

#### 6.3 FCC Regulations

All sensors communicate using unlicensed transmissions under FCC CFR 47 Part 15 [ECFR 2014]. These regulations restrict radiated power, transmission time, and frequency of periodic heartbeats, limiting the possible features and security of these devices.

### 7. Conclusion

This paper identifies the primary motivations of adversaries and the ways in which they can undermine home security systems. We modeled the adversary, home security systems, and created a general methodology for evaluating system susceptibility to attack primitives. Based on these models, we implemented the adversary’s attack primitives and applied them to three different security systems. For each system, the adversary has the capability to covertly infiltrate and exfiltrate, induce behavior in occupants and monitoring companies, and monitor the activities of the occupants.
