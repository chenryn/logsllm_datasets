on both opening and closing of doors, so if we see pairs of
transmission type 0xa0 and 0x80 then we have a door open
and close, respectively. If we encounter a 0x80 followed by
0x00 then it is a motion detector. In addition, some motion
detectors will only transmit an event once every three min-
utes to conserve power whereas doors transmit every event.
4.5.2
Home Layout
The way in which sensors are placed in a home, fortunately,
is sensible. Most homes will have less than a dozen sensors,
and we can be assured their placement will be prioritized
by the most high value and highly traﬃcked areas of the
home. So, while we may not know where a motion detector
is located in a home, if it is the only one in a home it will
lie in a path that must be traversed to access the bedroom.
The bedroom is the most high value room in a home. If we
ﬁnd multiple motion detectors belonging to a home, then
we can look at the times the sensors are set o↵ and ﬁgure
out which one is most likely the motion detector protecting
the bedroom (most likely the last one to transmit prior to a
sleep cycle), and which one is the living room/dining room
sensor (will transmit throughout the day most likely). The
same reasoning applies to the door sensors. Occupants tend
to add door sensors to all doors in a home that allow access
to the interior (including the garage). So, If we ﬁnd a door
sensor that typically transmits around the time a resident
goes to work that’ll be the door sensor closest to the garage.
4.5.3
Multiple Residents
We can draw meaningful conclusions from the aggregate in-
formation of a system, e.g., when is the residence occupied
Figure 9: Honeywell Replay Flow-Chart
and unoccupied. We can also tell when aggregate behav-
ior deviates, e.g., emergency situation, birthday party with
many attendees. We require additional intelligence on the
occupants to di↵erentiate between them. This area requires
future work.
4.6
Replay
A replay attack involves conducting some level of SIGINT
to acquire a transmission. Once a transmission is acquired,
the adversary plays back the transmission to accomplish the
original transmission’s intent.
4.6.1
Replay Implementation with GRC
The source for our replay ﬂow chart is one of the output ﬁles
from the SIGINT step. The contents of the ﬁle could be the
raw transmissions, bitstream, packet, or completely reverse
engineered capture.
The important part is whatever our
source ﬁle is, we must do the inverse of the capture function
to output on the USRP sink. We will focus on replay of a
raw transmission capture. The ﬂow chart is the inverse of
the SIGINT raw RF transmission capture, and can be seen
in Figure 9. So, this ﬂow chart uses the captured ﬁle as the
source and the USRP as the sink.
Replay is an e↵ective attack on the Honeywell system. With
this capability, an adversary can create false alarms for the
monitoring company whenever the system is armed. Due to
the ease of this attack, an adversary can cause false alarms at
multiple protected areas to cause the monitoring company
to misallocated resources. When targeting the occupants,
the adversary does not have to rely on an armed system.
The adversary can induce behavior by triggering particular
sensors, e.g., basement door, hallway to bedroom, hallway
to child’s bedroom, to either attract or repel occupants to
that area. This level of behavior inﬂuence requires a great
deal of information on the occupants and the protected area.
5.
APPLYING THE METHODOLOGY
Now that we have covered the models, attack primitive im-
plementations, and methodology, we apply our methodology
to two additional systems. The ﬁrst system is detailed in sec-
tion 4. In summary, the adversary has complete control of
the Honeywell system and full monitoring capability.
5.1
ADT System
The ADT system is comprised of 4 door sensors, 3 glass
break sensors, 1 motion detector, and a keypad control panel,
all of which are manufactured by DSC. The primary di↵er-
ences between this system and the Honeywell system is the
more advanced panel. The panel in this installation acts as
both the keypad and control panel, reducing required hard-
ware. It also alerts the monitoring company over GSM, so
this system is completely wireless. It was installed less than
a year ago by ADT.
Like the Honeywell system, all sensor communications can
potentially be jammed and intercepted. See Figure 10.
Figure 10: ADT System
The only change made to the jamming implementation in
section 4 was to change the center frequency to 433.92MHz.
We found the spot jammer to be very e↵ective, giving the ad-
versary covert inﬁltration and exﬁltration capabilities. We
attempted to enable RF Jam on the panel, but were unable
to acquire the required installer code per ADT’s policy. The
adversary has covert inﬁltration and exﬁltration capabilities
with this system.
The changes to the SIGINT ﬂow charts include changing the
center frequency to 433.92MHz and removing the Manch-
ester decoding. All SIGINT primitives were implemented,
however the ﬁnal reverse engineering e↵ort was not taken.
This was due to time constraints, and because the entire
protocol format could be found in the FCC documentation
for FCCID F5300NB912 [FCC 2014].
An excerpt can be
seen in Figure 11. With minimal e↵ort the adversary would
have full monitoring capability.
The only change made to the replay implementation in sec-
tion 4 was to change the center frequency to 433.92MHz.
Replay attacks are e↵ective, giving the adversary the capa-
bility to cause false alarms and induce behavior.
5.2
2GIG System
This is by far the most interesting system. It is composed of
4 wired door sensors, 1 wired motion detector, 1 12V control
panel, 1 wireless 2GIG door sensor, 1 Go!Control Panel, and
1 2GIG takeover module. The system appears to be a new
wireless system retroﬁtted onto an older-style wired system.
Both the wired and wireless components were installed in a
Figure 11: ADT Packet Format
new house which was completed in 2014. 2GIG equipment,
including the Go!Control panel in this system, is used by
Vivint.
As can be seen in Figure 12, this system’s topology is quite
di↵erent from the two previous systems. This is the only
system covered that has sensors wired directly to an alarm
device that is capable of alerting the monitoring company.
Unfortunately, the alarm device is not acting in that capac-
ity. In fact, its sole purpose is to aggregate all of the wires
and present them to the takeover module, which converts
the wired transmissions into vulnerable, wireless transmis-
sions. Because of this translation, the system is equivalent
to the other two systems, but with fewer points of failure
since the wireless transmissions of ﬁve sensors are radiating
from one takeover module.
Figure 12: 2GIG System
No changes were made to the jamming implementations in
section 4. We found the spot jammer to be very e↵ective,
giving the adversary covert inﬁltration and exﬁltration ca-
pabilities. We enabled RF Jam on the panel and found the
periodic jamming worked e↵ectively with an on time of 50
seconds and o↵ time of 0.20 seconds. So, the adversary has
the capability to covertly inﬁltrate and exﬁltrate.
No changes were made to the SIGINT implementations.
While the modulation, line coding, and packet sizes were
all the same as the Honeywell equipment, the contents of
the packets diverged slightly. Despite the slight changes, we
are still able to uniquely identify each device and the event
types, giving the adversary full monitoring capabilities.
No changes were made to the replay implementation in sec-
tion 4, giving the adversary the capability to cause false
alarms and induce behavior.

OBSERVATIONS
The attack primitives are e↵ective against all three systems
despite di↵erent graph topology, hardware, and communica-
tion protocols. We present several likely explanations.
6.1
Simple Protocols
In each of these systems, the alarm devices implicitly trust
the sensor communications and have no way of querying the
device from which the transmission originated. The proto-
cols seen in these security systems are very similar to legacy
15.231(a) Continuous transmissions such as voice,
video or data transmissions are not permitted.
15.231(a)(1) A manually operated transmitter shall
employ a switch that will automatically deactivate
the transmitter within not more than 5 seconds
after being released.
15.231(a)(2) A transmitter activated automati-
cally shall cease transmission within 5 seconds of
activation.
15.231(a)(3) Periodic transmissions at regular
pre-determined intervals are not permitted.
How-
ever polling or supervisory transmissions to de-
termine system integrity of transmitters used in
security or safety applications are allowed if the
periodic rate of transmission does not exceed one
transmission of not more than one second duration
per hour for each transmitter.
15.231(a)(4) Intentional radiators which are em-
ployed for radio control purposes during emergen-
cies involving fire, security, and safety of life,
when activated to signal an alarm, may operate
during the pendency of the alarm.
Figure 13: CFR 47 Part 15 Requirements
protocols, like Modbus, which lack authorization for com-
mands and security against interception.
It is also interesting that each system had the same packet
sequences to signify supervision messages (a sequence of re-
peated packets), and alert messages (two supervision mes-
sages separated by dead air).
This was most likely done
to reduce the time and monetary cost of implementing the
protocols.
6.2
Legacy Technology
From the FCC documentation, Honeywell has been using the
same Manchester encoded OOK scheme since at least 1998.
Digital Security Controls, the manufacturer for the ADT
system, has been using the same protocol since at least 2000.
2GIG, the manufacturer of the Go!Control panel which is
used by Vivint, curiously adopted a communication stack
very similar to Honeywell’s. Like Modbus use in industrial
control systems and ATMs running Windows XP, once a
component is used long enough in a process it is very diﬃcult
to remove.
6.3
FCC Regulations
All of the sensors covered in this paper communicate us-
ing unlicensed transmissions which fall under the purview of
FCC CFR 47 Part 15 [ECFR 2014]. FCC Part 15 compli-
ance is required for all electronics sold in the USA, and as-
sures electronics do not cause electromagnetic interference.
The wireless sensors are Part 15 compliant, but also meet
more stringent requirements since they are intentional radi-
ators, i.e., they communicate wirelessly. A sampling of these
requirements can be seen in Figure 13.
Due to the FCC restrictions, the manufacturers of these de-
vices are limited in their radiated power, transmission time,
and frequency of periodic heartbeats. These regulations re-
strict the possible features of devices, including security.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we identiﬁed the primary motivations of ad-
versaries and likely ways in which their goals of undermining
home security systems can be met. We modeled the adver-
sary, home security systems, and created a general method-
ology for evaluating the susceptibility of systems to the ad-
versary’s attack primitives.
Based on these models, we implemented the adversary’s at-
tack primitives and applied them to three di↵erent security
systems. For each of these systems, the adversary has the
capability to covertly inﬁltrate and exﬁltrate, induce behav-
ior in the occupants and monitoring companies, and monitor
the activities of the occupants.
