## Expected Behavior
There shouldn't be a warning when importing an svg icon. Or if there should
be, please update docs to reflect the correct way of rendering the SVG icon in
our code. Currently the docs don't show if any fontSize attribute needs to be
passed in.
## Current Behavior
When importing any svg icon, I get a warning saying:
`Warning: Received true for a non-boolean attribute fontSize. If you want to
write it to the DOM, pass a string instead: fontSize="true" or
fontSize={value.toString()}.`
I don't set a `fontSize` attribute in the tag, like how the docs show. This is
part of what my code looks like:
    import IconButton from 'material-ui-next/IconButton';
    import DeleteIcon from 'material-ui-icons/Delete';
     this.setState({ openDialog: true })}>
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Import any icon from `material-ui-icons` package.
  2. Render it.
  3. See warning in console.
NOTE: I tried this in codesandbox but did not see the warning. But here is the
link regardless:

## Context
I'm currently in the processing of migrating all Button components from
Material-UI v.0.20 to v.1 in my application at work. Currently, the way I'm
avoiding getting this warning is by actually not using SVG icons at all and
using, for instance `delete` instead.
