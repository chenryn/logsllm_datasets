User: I am attempting to build a python application with binary modules on OS X.  I want to build versions for Snow Leopard and Leopard from Lion.  I have XCode 4 installed with the 10.5 and 10.6 sdks and have been attempting to build using the MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET flag set to 10.6.  I receive an error from distutils complaining that python was built with a different deployment target.
I tried building a separate python binary with the deployment target set to 10.6 and then used virtualenv to try to build from that, but virtualenv expected a lib directory under the base env directory that was not there.
I am a total newb at developing on Mac and not even sure if what I want to do is possible.  Am I going to have to break down and have someone still running Snow Leopard build my distributions?
I really appreciate any assistance.
Assistant: I found the solution, go into your /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/distutils/sysconfig.py
Goto line 408 that says "raise DistutilsPlatformError" and add a '#' to comment out that line of code... This will "unleash the python"
You are basically telling python "don't worry its not 10.7, I know" there could be some crashes as a result but I think otherwise. My very complex python applicaiton now compiles on MacOSX 10.8 with no troubles and it seems to do the job, QA still has to test it though.
