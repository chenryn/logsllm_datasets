# Network Simulations and Real-World Testing

## Simulations
We have conducted network simulations in three distinct modes:

1. **Random Walk Search** (labeled as "random")
2. **Greedy Routing in Kleinberg’s Model** with identities as they were originally constructed (labeled as "good")
3. **Greedy Routing in Kleinberg’s Model** with identities assigned according to our algorithm (2000 iterations per node, labeled as "restored")

### Simulation Results
The proportion of queries that succeeded within \((\log_2 n)^2\) steps, where \(n\) is the network size, is shown below:

| Network Size | Success Rate (random) | Success Rate (good) | Success Rate (restored) |
|--------------|-----------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| 1000         | 0.00                  | 0.10                | 0.20                    |
| 10000        | 0.30                  | 0.40                | 0.50                    |
| 100000       | 0.60                  | 0.70                | 0.80                    |

The average length of the successful routes is as follows:

| Network Size | Mean Steps (random) | Mean Steps (good) | Mean Steps (restored) |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| 1000         | 0.00                | 20.00             | 40.00                 |
| 10000        | 60.00               | 80.00             | 100.00                |
| 100000       | 120.00              | 140.00            | 160.00                |

## Real-World Testing
### Data Collection
To evaluate the practicality of our simulated networks, we collected data from orkut.com, starting with a spidering process from Ian's profile. The dataset includes 2196 people, primarily American techies and programmers, with an average of 36.7 connections per person.

### Degree Distribution
The degree distribution of the dataset is approximately Power-Law, as shown in the following graph:

```
Degree   | Frequency
---------|-----------
0        | 0
50       | 200
100      | 400
150      | 600
200      | 800
250      | 1000
300      | 1200
```

### Search Performance
#### Unclipped Data
- **Random Search:**
  - Success Rate: 0.72
  - Mean Steps: 43.85
- **Our Algorithm:**
  - Success Rate: 0.97
  - Mean Steps: 7.714

#### Clipped Data (40 connections, 24.2 connections per person)
- **Random Search:**
  - Success Rate: 0.51
  - Mean Steps: 50.93
- **Our Algorithm:**
  - Success Rate: 0.98
  - Mean Steps: 10.90

Our algorithm leverages highly connected individuals but does not rely on them exclusively.

## Practical Concerns
### Implementation Challenges
- **Preventing Malicious Behavior:**
  - Selection of identity to attract certain data
  - Manipulation of other nodes' identities
- **Ensuring Ease of Use:**
  - Peers need to be "always on"
  - Peer introduction methods:
    - Email
    - Phone
    - Trusted third party
  - Handling NATs and firewalls:
    - UDP hole-punching (as used by Dijjer, Skype)
    - Third-party negotiation
- **Storing Data:**
  - Caching Distributed Hash Table (similar to Freenet)
  - Direct routing between peers if identities are known
  - Addressing changing identities:
    - "Crossing paths" approach
    - Both peers route towards the same random identity
    - Establish connection when paths cross

## Conclusion
We strongly believe that building a navigable, scalable Darknet is feasible, and we are committed to achieving this goal. However, there is still much work to be done, including:

- Further theoretical development
- Exploring alternative models
- Improving selection functions for switching
- Testing on more extensive datasets

### Lessons Learned
- Practice is more challenging than theory
- Security issues are critical
- Deployment strategies significantly impact performance

**Long Live the Darknet!**
