## Abstract
Online programming discussion platforms like Stack Overflow serve as a rich source of information for software developers, providing vibrant discussions and ready-to-use code snippets. Previous research has identified Stack Overflow as one of the most important information sources for developers. Anecdotal evidence suggests that developers often copy and paste code snippets from these platforms for convenience. This behavior results in a constant flow of community-provided code snippets into production software. However, the impact of this practice on code security remains largely unknown.

In this study, we quantify the proliferation of security-related code snippets from Stack Overflow in Android applications available on Google Play. While access to such a rich source of information offers significant benefits, it also poses risks to code security. Due to the complex nature of security, it is challenging to provide ready-to-use and secure solutions for every problem. Integrating security-related code snippets from Stack Overflow into production software requires caution and expertise. Our findings are alarming: 15.4% of the 1.3 million Android applications analyzed contained security-related code snippets from Stack Overflow, with 97.9% of these containing at least one insecure code snippet.

## Introduction
Discussion platforms for software developers have gained popularity, especially among inexperienced programmers who value the direct help and ready-to-use code snippets provided by the community. It is widely believed that copying such code snippets into production software is a common practice, not just among novices but also by a large part of the developer community. Access to the rich information on public discussion platforms allows for quick solutions, efficient workflows, and the potential distribution of best practices, which can improve code quality. However, when it comes to code security, the opposite is often observed. For example, Android-related discussions on Stack Overflow frequently include problematic practices, such as requesting unnecessary permissions, implementing insecure X.509 certificate validation, and misusing Android’s cryptographic API.

## Contributions
Our study investigates the extent to which security-related code snippets posted on Stack Overflow are copied into Android applications available on Google Play. Our key contributions are:

- We identified all Android posts on Stack Overflow, extracted 4,019 security-related code snippets, and analyzed their security using a robust machine learning approach.
- We applied state-of-the-art static code analysis techniques to detect these code snippets in 1.3 million Android applications.
- We found that 15.4% of the 1.3 million Android applications contained security-related code snippets from Stack Overflow, with 97.9% of these containing at least one insecure code snippet.
- We designed and implemented a fully automated, large-scale processing pipeline to measure the flow of security-related code snippets from Stack Overflow into Android applications.
- We make all data available at [this link](https://www.aisec.fraunhofer.de/stackoverflow).

## Processing Pipeline Architecture
Our processing pipeline is fully automated and scalable for measuring the flow of code snippets from platforms other than Stack Overflow and software repositories other than Google Play. The pipeline consists of the following steps (as shown in Figure 1):

1. **Code Extraction**: Crawl Stack Overflow and extract all code snippets.
2. **Filtering**: Filter out security-related code snippets.
3. **Classification**: Label each snippet as secure or insecure using machine learning.
4. **Program Dependency Graph Generation**: Generate an abstract representation of each labeled code snippet.
5. **Clone Detection**: Detect clones of these snippets in Google Play.

Each step is fully automated, with the exception of the initial training data labeling for the machine learning classification. This approach is time-efficient and yields accurate results.

## Code Extraction and Filtering
We begin by crawling discussion threads from Stack Overflow to extract actual code snippets. Next, we filter out security-related snippets based on specific criteria. On Android, security operations include cryptographic operations, secure network communication, PKI-based validation, authentication, and access control. We define a code snippet as security-related if it makes calls to the following APIs:

- **Cryptography**: Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA), Java Cryptography Extension (JCE)
- **Secure Network Communications**: Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE), Java Generic Security Service (JGSS), Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)
- **Public Key Infrastructure**: X.509 and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL) in `java.security.cert`, Java certification path API, PKCS#11, OCSP
- **Authentication and Access Control**: Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS)

Additionally, we included code snippets referencing security libraries specifically designed for Android, such as BouncyCastle, SpongyCastle, Apache TLS/SSL, keyczar, jasypt, and GNU Crypto. Table I provides an overview of the supported features of these security libraries.

| Library | Features |
|---------|----------|
| BouncyCastle | Fully applies |
| SpongyCastle | Fully applies |
| Apache TLS/SSL | Fully applies |
| keyczar | Fully applies |
| jasypt | Fully applies |
| GNU Crypto | Does not apply at all |

## Conclusion
Our study highlights the significant risk posed by the widespread use of insecure code snippets from Stack Overflow in Android applications. Developers must exercise caution and expertise when integrating such code into production software. Future work should focus on developing better tools and practices to mitigate these risks and ensure the security of Android applications.
