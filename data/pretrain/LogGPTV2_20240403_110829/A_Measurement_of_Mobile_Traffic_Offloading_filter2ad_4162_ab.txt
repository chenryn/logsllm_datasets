#### Traffic and User Offload Ratios
Next, we investigate the degree of traffic offloading. We define the traffic offload ratio as the ratio of WiFi traffic volume to the total traffic volume, and the user offload ratio as the ratio of the number of WiFi users to the total number of users in 30-minute bins. A ratio closer to 1.0 indicates a higher penetration of WiFi usage, while a ratio closer to 0.0 indicates a higher penetration of 3G usage.

**Figure 2 (a)** represents the traffic offload ratio over time. The average traffic offload ratio was 0.64, with significant variations depending on smartphone usage. The peak and bottom ratios were 0.97 and 0.19, respectively. The figure highlights that the offloading ratio on Sunday is relatively higher than on Monday. The average ratio was 0.70 on Sunday and 0.58 on Monday. The lower offloading ratio in the morning and afternoon on Monday suggests fewer opportunities to connect to the Internet via WiFi during work hours. As expected, the ratio increased on Monday night.

**Figure 2 (b)** shows the breakdown of users:
1. 3G users whose WiFi interface was also up.
2. 3G users whose WiFi interface was down.
3. WiFi users.

The average user offload ratio corresponding to case (3) was smaller (0.22) than the average traffic offload ratio. We again confirm higher ratios during the night and lower ones in the afternoon. Only 15% of users connected to WiFi during business hours on Monday, and over 50% of users explicitly turned off their WiFi interface during these hours, as shown in case (2). The ratio of 3G users whose WiFi was also up is stable (≈ 0.3), indicating that they had few chances to encounter available access points (APs). In particular, the ratios of 3G users whose WiFi was up and WiFi users at night are closer, suggesting that WiFi APs were effective for almost half of the users who turned on WiFi at night. In contrast, only about 35% of users who turned on their WiFi interface could download data via WiFi during business hours.

#### Conclusion
Comparing both figures, we can conclude that traffic offloading was mainly exploited by a relatively smaller number of users. In other words, such heavy users switched their network interfaces explicitly.

### Per-User View

**Figure 3. Scatter Plot of 3G and WiFi Download Traffic Volume per User**
- **Horizontal dots in the bottom**: Users who only used 3G.
- **Vertical dots in the left**: Users who only used WiFi.
- **Diagonal line**: Users who used 3G and WiFi equally.
- **Dots below the diagonal**: Users with more 3G traffic than WiFi traffic.

A non-negligible number of dots below the diagonal show that there is a possibility of increasing traffic offloading. For example, the traffic volume of 3G-only users accounted for 9.6% of the total traffic volume, while that of users whose WiFi traffic is less than 1MB accounted for 17.4% of the total volume.

**Figure 4. Cumulative Distribution of Offload Ratio per User**
- **3G-only users**: Approximately 20% of all users.
- **WiFi-only users**: 10% of all users.
- **Median of users**: Used more WiFi than 3G (0.62).
- **Top 30% of users**: Switched 90% of traffic volume to WiFi.

These results are consistent with the previous findings that revealed a relatively small portion of users penetrate to WiFi offloading.

**Figure 5. Total Traffic Volume and Traffic Offload Ratio**
- **Positive correlation (0.35)** between total download traffic volume per user and its traffic offload ratio, indicating that heavy-hitters consume more bandwidth via WiFi and that 3G-only users received less data than offloading users. We conclude that heavy-hitters efficiently use WiFi for their download traffic.

### WiFi Usage

**Figure 6. Ratio of WiFi Duration and Traffic Offload Ratio**
- **Diagonal in the figure**: Users whose WiFi traffic volume is proportional to its duration.
- **Plots concentrated near (0, 0)**: 3G only users.
- **Plots concentrated near (1, 1)**: WiFi only users.
- **Scattered plots around lower durations and higher offload ratios**: Hybrid users who downloaded most of their traffic volume via WiFi in shorter periods, consistent with the macroscopic observation in Figure 2.

#### Location of WiFi APs
We investigate the location where users associate with WiFi APs. SSID is an identifier of AP in WiFi, and administrators of APs can set their name or leave it as the default setting. By categorizing the names of ESSIDs, we infer the types of locations of APs with which users associated. We gathered all SSIDs appearing in the dataset (418 unique ESSIDs) and manually classified them into the following four categories:

- **Public (8 ESSIDs)**: SSIDs provided by 3G carriers (e.g., "docomo", "au WIFI", "0001softbank") and third-party WiFi carriers (e.g., "FON", "0033"), and administrators who freely open to all users (e.g., "freespot").
- **Home (261 ESSIDs)**: Default ESSIDs when AP manufacturers shipped. These APs are assumed to be located at home rather than in an office due to the small number of devices and less careful administrators.
- **Mobile (19 ESSIDs)**: Default ESSIDs for portable WiFi routers with a 3G uplink and WiFi downlink provided by 3G carriers. The user’s smartphone connects to this router via WiFi to obtain an Internet connection.

This analysis provides a comprehensive view of WiFi offloading behavior and the factors influencing it, highlighting the importance of heavy users and the potential for further offloading.
