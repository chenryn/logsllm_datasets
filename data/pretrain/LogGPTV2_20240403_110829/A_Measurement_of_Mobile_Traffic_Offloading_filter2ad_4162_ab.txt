Fig. 2. WiFi oﬄoad ratio (bin size = 30min) (a) bytes and (b) users
Next, we investigate the degree of traﬃc oﬄoading. We deﬁne a traﬃc oﬄoad
ratio as the ratio of WiFi traﬃc volume to the total volume and a user oﬄoad
ratio as the ratio of the number of WiFi users to the total number of users in
30-minute bins. The ratio closer to 1.0 means the penetration to a WiFi network
while that closer to 0.0 means the penetration to a 3G network.
Figure 2 (a) represents the traﬃc oﬄoad ratio over time. The average traﬃc
oﬄoad ratio was 0.64 though it varied largely depending on the usage of smart-
phone; the peak and bottom ratios are 0.97 and 0.19, respectively. The ﬁgure
highlights the fact that the oﬄoading ratio on Sunday is relatively higher than
that on Monday. The average ratio was 0.70 on Sunday and 0.58 on Monday.
The lower oﬄoading ratio in the morning and afternoon on Monday suggests
fewer opportunities to connect to the Internet via WiFi during work time. As
expected, again, the ratio increased on Monday night.
Figure 2 (b) shows the breakdown of users: (1) 3G users whose WiFi interface
was also up, (2) 3G users whose WiFi interface was down, and (3) WiFi users.
The average user oﬄoad ratio corresponding to case (3) was smaller (0.22) than
the average traﬃc oﬄoad ratio. We, again, conﬁrm higher ratios during night
and lower ones in the afternoon. Only 15% of users connected to WiFi in business
hours on Monday, moreover, over 50% of users explicitly turned oﬀ their WiFi
interface in business hours as shown in case (2). Similarly, the ratio of 3G users
whose WiFi was also up is stable (≈ 0.3), indicating that they had few chances
to encounter any available APs. In particular, the ratios of 3G users whose
WiFi was up and WiFi users in night are closer. This means that WiFi APs
were actually eﬀective for almost half of users who turned on WiFi in night. In
contrast, only about 35% of users who turned on WiFi interface could download
data via WiFi in business hours.

Comparing both ﬁgures, we can conclude that the traﬃc oﬄoad was mainly
exploited by a relatively smaller number of users. In other words, such heavy
users switched their network interfaces explicitly.
3.2 Per-User View
Here, we focus on a microscopic view of traﬃc oﬄoading. Figure 3 displays
the scatter plot of 3G traﬃc and WiFi traﬃc volume per user for two days.
We conﬁrm horizontal dots in the bottom and vertical dots in the left of the
ﬁgure, corresponding to the users who only used 3G and WiFi respectively. The
former did not use WiFi even at home, and the latter likely saved the fee for
3G network access. A diagonal line in the ﬁgure represents users who used 3G
and WiFi equally. A non-negligible number of dots below the diagonal, i.e., 3G
traﬃc volume is greater than WiFi traﬃc volume, show that there is a possibility
of increasing traﬃc oﬄoading. For example, the traﬃc volume of 3G-only users
accounted for 9.6% of the total traﬃc volume, while that of users whose WiFi
traﬃc is less than 1MB accounted for 17.4% of the total volume.
In addition, Figure 4 displays the cumulative user distribution of the ratio of
using WiFi and 3G per user. As explained before, a high (or low) traﬃc oﬄoad
ratio corresponds to the penetration of WiFi (or 3G) usage. From the ﬁgure, we
observe that the 3G-only users accounted for approximately 20% of all users and
the WiFi-only users accounted for 10%. The median of users used more WiFi
than 3G (0.62). Notably, the top 30% of users switched 90% of traﬃc volume
to WiFi. These results are consistent with the previous results that revealed a
relatively small portion of users penetrate to WiFi oﬄoading.
Similarly, Figure 5 shows the relationship between total download traﬃc vol-
ume per user and its traﬃc oﬄoad ratio. We conﬁrm a positive correlation (0.35)
between two metrics, indicating that heavy-hitters consume more bandwidth via
WiFi and that 3G-only users received less data than oﬄoading users. We con-
clude that heavy-hitters eﬃciently use WiFi for their download traﬃc.

WIFI duration / Total duration
Fig. 5. Total traﬃc volume and traﬃc of-
ﬂoad ratio
Fig. 6. Ratio of WiFi duration and traﬃc
oﬄoad ratio
Finally, we examine the traﬃc penetration to WiFi and the duration using
WiFi interface. Figure 6 displays the scatter plot of the ratio of duration using
WiFi to the total duration and the traﬃc oﬄoad ratio per user. The diagonal
in the ﬁgure indicates the users whose WiFi traﬃc volume is proportional to its
duration. As expected, we see plots concentrated near (0, 0) (i.e., 3G only user)
and (1, 1) (i.e., WiFi only user). A notable point, however, is that we still observe
plots scattered around lower ratios of the duration and higher oﬄoad ratios. This
means that these hybrid users downloaded most of their traﬃc volume via WIFi
in shorter periods, consistent with the macroscopic observation in Figure 2.
3.3 WiFi Usage
Here, we investigate the location where users associate with WiFi APs. SSID is
an identiﬁer of AP in WiFi, and administrators of APs could set their name by
themselves, or it could also be left as the default setting. Thus, by categorizing
the names of ESSIDs, we could infer the types of location of APs with which
users associated. We gathered all SSIDs appearing in the dataset (418 unique
ESSIDs) and manually classiﬁed them into the following four categories.
– public (8 ESSIDs) is SSIDs that 3G carriers freely provide to their customers
(e.g., “docomo”, “au WIFI”, “0001softbank”) and the third-party WiFi car-
riers provide to their customers (basically at charge) (e.g., “FON”, “0033”)
and administrators freely open to all users (e.g., “freespot”).
– home (261 ESSIDs) is default ESSIDs when AP manufacturers shipped.
Thus, administrators of such APs do not change their ESSID from the de-
fault setting. We assumed that such access points are located at home rather
than in an oﬃce, because the number of devices at home is small and these
administrators are likely to be less careful in changing ESSIDs than admin-
istrators in oﬃce networks.
– mobile (19 ESSIDs) is default ESSIDs for a portable WiFi router with a 3G
uplink and WiFi down link provided by 3G carriers. The user’s smartphone
connects to this router via WiFi to obtain an Internet connection.
