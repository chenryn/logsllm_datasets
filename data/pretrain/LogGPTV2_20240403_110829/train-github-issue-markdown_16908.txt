## Add support to FancyZones editor for pixel coordinates to allow for fine-
grained FancyZones setups
The idea is to describe/configure the FancyZone rectangles as origin +
dimensions in pixels in the UI.
This would help for video streaming and screen sharing setups, that just want
to share parts of the screen, but have accurate window place. An example usage
is in conjunction with OBS Studio and the crop screen feature (I am already
using it like, but configuring the zones visually is prone to a lot of try and
error).
If the amount of work for this is reasonable, I'd also love to help
contributing this feature.
