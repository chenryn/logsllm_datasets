### Table V: Unweighted Survey Demographics Averaged Across All Three Years

The table below presents unweighted survey demographics, averaged across all three years of our survey. The demographics include participants' reported gender, age, education, and LGBTQ+ status. Due to limitations with our panel provider, we were unable to survey non-binary participants. Additionally, in regions where identifying as LGBTQ+ is heavily stigmatized or dangerous due to government policies, we did not ask about this affiliation, denoted by a blank symbol (–).

### C. Regression Tables

We present the full parameters and resulting outputs for our logistic regression models that predict the likelihood of experiencing (1) or not experiencing (0) online hate and harassment. The models include:

1. **Table VI**: Whether a participant would experience any form of online hate and harassment.
2. **Table VII**: Whether a participant would experience any form of severe hate and harassment.
3. **Table VIII**: Whether a participant would experience any form of moderate hate and harassment.

Our definitions of moderate and severe abuse were selected to enable comparison with previous survey results from Pew [118] and are not a value statement on the intensity of abuse.
