TABLE V: Unweighted survey demographics averaged across all three years of our survey. We include a participant’s reported gender, age,
education, and LGBTQ+ status. We note that due to limitations with our panel provider, we were unable to survey for non-binary participants.
We speciﬁcally avoided asking whether participants identiﬁed as LGBTQ+ in regions where such afﬁliations are heavily stigmatized or
dangerous due to government policies; we note these with a blank symbol (–).

C. Regression tables
We present
the likelihood of
experiencing (1) or not experiencing (0) online hate and harassment. We report the independent variable (all categorical
variables), our baseline of comparison, the model coefﬁcient (β), standard error (SE), the z-score (z), p-value, and the
resulting odds ratio (OR). Our models include: whether a participant would experience any form of online hate and harassment
(Table VI); whether a participant would experience any form of severe hate and harassment (Table VII); and whether a
participant would experience any form of moderate hate and harassment (Table VIII). Our deﬁnition of moderate or severe
abuse were selected to enable comparison with previous survey results from Pew [118], and are not a value statement on the
intensity of abuse.
