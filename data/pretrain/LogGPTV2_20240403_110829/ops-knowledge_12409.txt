User: When I type python into the command line, the command prompt says python is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program, or batch file. What should I do?
Note: I have Python 2.7 and Python 3.2 installed on my computer.
Assistant: Here's one for for office workers using a computer shared by others.
I did put my user path in path and created the PYTHONPATH variables in my computer's PATH variable. Its listed under Environment Variables in Computer Properties -> Advanced Settings in Windows 7. 
Example:
C:\Users\randuser\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37
This made it so I could use the command prompt.
Hope this helped.
