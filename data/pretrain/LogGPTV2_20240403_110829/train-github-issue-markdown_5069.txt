I tried writing tarai function with Rust, version info is:
    $ rustc --version
    rustc 1.0.0-dev (3d5fbae33 2015-01-13 01:08:03 +0000)
written code is:
    #![feature(unboxed_closures)]
    fn tarai i32>(x:i32, y:i32, z:F) -> i32 {
        if x  i32>(x:i32, y:i32, z:F) -> i32 {
    21-161505.rs:4     if x <= y {
    21-161505.rs:5         y
    21-161505.rs:6     }
    21-161505.rs:7     else {
    21-161505.rs:8         let fz = z();
                   ...
Why my code is wrong? And what should I do for pass compiling without errors?  
Please show me these. Sorry for poor my english. Thank you.
