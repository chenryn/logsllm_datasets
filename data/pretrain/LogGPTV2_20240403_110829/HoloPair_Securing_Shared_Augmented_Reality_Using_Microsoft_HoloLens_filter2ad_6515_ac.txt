Instructions for the user in role UA:
(1) Once you see UB waving, gaze and click on them.
(2) Watch as UB moves their finger along the shown shape. If
their hand movement follows the shape, gaze and click on
them. Otherwise say "Abort".
Instructions for the user in role UB:
(1) Wave towards UA.
(2) Move your finger along the shape shown in front of you,
starting from number 1.
As the usability evaluation in the next section shows, the manual
steps are based on natural gesture that users learn quickly. While a
few initially needed to practice the gaze and click gesture, this is a
standard primitive that AR headset users are likely to already have
mastered before starting to use HoloPair. However, the manual
behavior that HoloPair introduces, namely following the shape
with their finger, was naturally and easily performed by all protocol
participants.
7 EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION
We now experimentally evaluate the HoloPair system with respect
to average pairing time, users’ ability to detect man-in-the-middle
attempts, and subjective usability, measured with a questionnaire.
Additionally, we provide data on computational performance of the
developed HoloPair prototype.
7.1 Pilot User Study
While designing and prototyping the HoloPair system, we imple-
mented three different versions of the shared secret confirmation

main user study when no attack was simulated. Pairing
times are computed from the moment from when UA con-

a successful pairing or one of them said "Abort".
step (shown in Figure 9), and we chose the most suitable one after
running a small-scale pilot user study.
In the pilot user study, 6 participants were instructed to repeat-
edly pair their headsets using the supported schemes in both roles,
and were afterwards asked to state which scheme they found the
most usable. Somewhat surprisingly, all participants indicated that
they preferred the version of the shared secret confirmation step
in which UB is required to follow the shape generated in space
with their hand (version (c) in Figure 9). Besides being subjectively
the most usable, this scheme conveniently supports the highest
theoretical entropy of the weak-hash ((10× 10)N ), and was also the
easiest to explain to pilot-study participants.
Consequently, we decided to fully focus the main user study,
which consisted of 22 new participants, on evaluating the perfor-
mance, security, and usability of this variant of the shared secret
confirmation.
7.2 Main User Study
In our main user study, we invited a total of 22 participants to
experimentally use the system.
Demographics. We recruited a total of 22 participants (14 female,
18 male, aged from 21 to 33) using mailing lists and social media
posts. None of the study participants owned a HoloLens device nor
had extensive prior experience using AR headsets.
Setup. Participants were invited to the study in pairs, and were not
grouped by any specific criteria except available times to participate
in the experiment. Upon arriving, participants were introduced to
goals of the experiment, given the chance to ask questions and asked
to sign the consent form. The experiment introduction explained
the reasoning behind the need to securely pair augmented reality
headsets, the envisioned usage scenario and the potential attacks
that can happen during the process. Participants were told that
their goal will be to repeat the pairing attempt several times, and
that we might simulate an attack during some of the attempts.
Procedure. Not having any previous experience with AR, study
participants were first given the opportunity to get accustomed

ture recognition (click to confirm a successful pairing), and voice
recognition (say "Abort"when an attack is detected).
Each pair of participants was asked to perform a minimum of
10 pairing attempts, after which the protocol roles (UA, UB) were
switched and participants performed at least additional 10 or more
pairing attempts.
The experiments measured the impact of two independent vari-
ables:
(1) Attack Simulation. The main need for user involvement
in the HoloPair system is to detect potential man-in-the-middle at-
tacks, which are evident by a mismatch of independently generated
weak-hashes on two headsets. In order to evaluate users’ ability to
detect such attacks, we simulated differing shapes being shown to
participants in randomly chosen 20% of the pairing attempts.
(2) N, Shape Complexity. In order to evaluate the impact of
complexity of the shared secret confirmation step on the dependent
variables (total time and success rates), we varied the value of N , the
number of shape segments. In each pairing attempt, N is randomly
chosen from the set {4, 6, 8}.
Measured Data. After having a total of 22 participants take part
in the main study, we gathered data on the execution of a total of
230 pairing attempts, out of which a man-in-the-middle attack was
simulated in 44 cases.
For each pairing attempt, we measured two sets of dependent
variables: (1) timestamps at which users entered each step of the
pairing protocol, and (2) whether the pairing attempt was success-
ful, either by detecting a potential attack (when it was simulated), or
correctly exchanging the shared secret (when no attack simulation
took place).
Given the non-sensitive data that we measured and stored anony-
mously, our institution does not require an Institutional Review
Board approval for these kinds of studies. However, all study par-
ticipants were given a written explanation of the goals of the study,
signed a consent form, and were aware that their data will be used
for publication.
Results: Pairing Time. Figure 5 shows the relative distribution
of the total times for all pairing attempts in our main user study,
measured from the moment when UA reveals its commitment on
a specific instance of the weak-hash. The median pairing time for
users is between 8 and 9 seconds, while 80% of successful pairing
attempts finish in less than 13 seconds. These times are comparable
or close to previously reported confirmation times for similar device
pairing schemes [2, 8]. Furthermore, considering that this process
needs to be repeated only once for each new pair or devices, as
we show in the remainder of this section, the majority of study
participants found the System both usable and sufficiently fast.
It is interesting to note that we observed longer average pairing
times in the case when users decided to abort the pairing execution,
as shown in Figure 6. This is likely due to two reasons. Firstly,
after observing that the gesture did not match the expectation,
participants often repeat it before deciding to abort. Secondly, we
observed that, despite the simplicity of the voice command ("Abort"),
their instruction was sometimes not recognized by the device on the
Figure 6: Average pairing times and standard error of the
mean as a function of complexity of the shared secret confir-
mation step, N . As N changes from 4 to 8, the average pairing
time increases, but only slightly. This indicates that the to-
tal time spent performing the gesture does not depend on its
complexity as much as it does on other user behavior, such
as waiting, making the decision, or clicking.
first attempt, which increased the time before the device recorded
that a decision was made.
However, we emphasize that in the case of attacks, the time until
users make an ultimate decision is of significantly smaller influence.
It is much more important that participants in our study detected
potential attacks with high success rates, which we discuss next.
Results: Success Rates of Pairing and Attack Detection. Pre-
vious research has shown that users are often inattentive, do not
understand the risks, or simply proceed without even trying to
verify the exchanged shared secrets [24]. Since we simulate attack
attempts in a percentage of pairing runs, we are able to estimate the
likelihood of a successful man-in-the-middle attack even when the
two weak-hashes do not collide, but users fail to recognize this. We
consider a pairing attempt successful if UA confirmed that shapes
match when there is no attack simulation, or if the same participant
called "Abort"in the case where an attack was indeed simulated.
The success rates that our system achieved in our user study
are highly encouraging: our results show that 91% of simulated
attacks (43/47) were detected by the study participants. While
there numbers are high, it is important to note the possibility that
study participants in general are generally more vigilant by the
virtue of being measured and performing a novel interaction. How-
ever, even though participants might become less attentive as they
get accustomed to using the HoloPair system, we note here that
the measured success rate is comparable or better than the results
achieved in studies which similarly tested user’s ability to compare
different short strings, hashes, or pictures [15, 24].
An even higher success rate was achieved in the case where there
was no attack, where 98% of pairing attempts were successful
(181/186), with only 4 false aborts when both weak-hashes did
indeed match. This further confirm that relying on precisely located
holograms that are independently shown to both participants and
using gestures to validate that their shapes indeed match allows
for confirmation of fairly high-entropy information.
Results: Impact of the Shared Hologram Complexity (N ). We
now look into how the the average augmented reality headset

pairing times depend on N , the complexity of the secret shared
hologram.
As shown in Figure 6, increasing N does expectedly increase the
average required time for two users to pair their headsets, but only
to an extent that is within 1 second. The small difference is visible
both in the case of attack simulations (light green) and in the case
when no attack was simulated (green).
The small difference in pairing times indicates that users spent
the majority of pairing in other behavior, such as waiting, deciding,
or inputting the decision into their own device (confirming via a
click gesture, or aborting by saying "Abort").
Results: Learning Effects.
Finally, we analyze the extent to which users learn to use the
HoloPair system more efficiently with repetition of the pairing
procedure. Figure 7 shows the mean and standard deviation of all
successful pairing attempts in our study, grouped by their session
index. All pairing attempts in which one participant takes the of
UA are considered a single session, and we thus have two sessions
per participant pair.
As expected, the mean pairing time reduces as users repeat the
procedure multiple times, from about 11 seconds in their first mea-
sured attempt, to less then 9 seconds on their 10th attempts (we
do not take into account the "practice" attempts here). These re-
sults suggest that despite their initial inexperience with using AR
headsets, participants indeed quickly become accustomed with the
HoloPair system, as they also indicated in the usability question-
naire (Q7), which we discuss next.
7.3 Usability Questionnaire
After participants performed multiple pairing attempts in both roles,
we asses the usability and user perception towards the HoloPair
system and the implemented prototype by asking them to complete
the System Usability Scale [5] (SUS).
SUS is a reliable and general tool for evaluating the usability of
various systems, which has been widely used since its introduc-
tion [3]. The questionnaire consists of 10 statements such as "Q6: I
thought there was too much inconsistency in this system" or "Q9: I
felt confident using the system" that users of the system grade on a
Likert scale (1 - Strongly disagree, 5 - Strongly agree). The full list
of questions is provided in the Appendix A.
Figure 8: Participants’ responses to the SUS questionnaire
show a high average SUS score of 86.4. None of the partici-
pants thought that they had to learn a lot before they could
get going with the system (Q10). While some felt they would
need a help of a technical person (Q4), most generally found
the system easy to use (Q3) and believed others would learn
to use the system very quickly (Q7).
Results: Usability Questionnaire. We show the overall results
of the SUS questionnaire in Figure 8. None of the study participants
thought that they had to learn a lot before they could get going
with the system (Q10), and while some felt they would need a help
of a technical person (Q4), most users generally found the system
easy to use (Q3) and believed others would learn to use the system
very quickly (Q7).
While some users believed that they would need support of a
technical person to be able to use the system, this is likely due to
the fact that learning how to use the gestures did indeed require
initial help from the experimenters, but was quickly grasped by the
participants (as also visible in Figure 7). Furthermore, once users get
accustomed to such gestures by using other Microsoft Holographic
applications, they are likely to not need any help to start using the
HoloPair system.
Based on the total of 22 participants who completed the ques-
tionnaire, none of which have had extensive previous experience
using HoloLens, the HoloPair system achieves an average overall
SUS score of 86.9. Previous research on interpreting individual
scores concluded that the mean SUS score of 85 translates into users’
adjective rating of "Excellent" [3]. Consequently, we conclude that
the majority of the study participants found the usability of the
HoloPair system to be well above the average.
7.4 Prototype Performance
Table 1 provides measurements of the maximal relative impact of
the HoloPair prototype on the battery load, RAM, CPU, and GPU
load, as well as the total application size.
The maximal increase in GPU, RAM, and CPU load is bellow 15%
of their maximal amounts, while the total application size is 130 MB.
Such small performance footprint is expected, considering the small
number of messages that our system actually exchanges over the
wireless network, and contrasting this with the need to exchange

While performance was not one of our considerations during
the development of the HoloPair prototype, and thus the measured
values could likely be further improved, we conclude that the cur-
rent prototype already achieves a low overall impact on the existing
HoloLens device.
8 DISCUSSION
Automating the Confirmation Step. In this paper, we rely on
UA to verify that the observed gesture made by UB indeed matches
the expectation based on the HWA. This step could in future be au-
tomated by incorporating a gesture recognition system that would
be able to track the precise location of UB’s hands. However, it is
important to note that the current system also relies on the inherent
human ability to detect anomalies and e.g. follow only the legit-
imate user, while detecting or ignoring any adversary’s attempt
to inject into the visual out-of-band channel. We thus leave this
possibility for future work, together with the challenge of design-
ing user gestures that would be particularly suitable for automated
verification.
Designing for AR. While implementing the HoloPair prototype,
we evaluated several design choices that had a large impact on
the usability of the system. Besides the (incorrect) intuition that
using a voice command to abort the protocol run would be more
convenient, the largest usability improvement came as a the result of
using only mixed-reality holograms to display information. Despite
the initial expectation that important messages and objects would
be best visible if always visible in a form of a Heads-Up-Display
(HUD), reading information shown as real, mixed-reality objects
with a fixed location in the environment proved to be significantly
more natural. This is likely due to the fact that such holograms
can be approached when needed, quickly and naturally glanced, or
otherwise ignored.
Given that is one of the core new capabilities of the HoloLens
