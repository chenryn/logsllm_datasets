### Orbitz and Multilingual Support
Orbitz does not support multiple languages on its website or at customer touch points. However, it complies with the specific requirements of EU member countries due to differing privacy regulations. For those who do not wish to agree to the Orbitz privacy statement, which involves transferring personal information outside the European Union, Orbitz recommends using a European travel agency, such as ebookers.com.

### Data Formats and Integration
The evaluation of data formats and integration provided by the three online travel agencies (OTAs) is based on the information available on their respective websites. All three OTAs support the exchange of supplier information using XML-based formats. Orbitz, in particular, supports various formats, including XML, and holds a competitive advantage through its individual supplier link technology. This technology bypasses existing Global Distribution Systems (GDS), saving fees that would otherwise be paid for accessing GDS information, allowing Orbitz to offer lower prices to customers.

### Customization Options
The customization options for dynamic packaging vary among the OTAs. Expedia offers the most diverse range of suppliers that can be combined in one package, including rental cars, flights, hotels, sightseeing, restaurants, tours, and theme parks. Travelocity and Orbitz limit their offerings to flights, car rentals, and hotels. All three OTAs provide travel cancellation insurance. Orbitz collects additional data about customer interests in terms of activities and destinations, using this information to customize email alerts, newsletters, and offers on its website. Additionally, Orbitz provides travel event alerts, such as notifications for flight delays.

### Pricing and Availability
Pricing and availability information is provided by all evaluated OTAs. Expedia explicitly states the savings in dollars, while Orbitz and Travelocity only advertise that their packages are cheaper. 

### Multimedia Descriptions
Multimedia descriptions for hotels include textual descriptions, photographs, and maps. Travelocity also offers "virtual tours," which are 360-degree images giving the illusion of video. None of the OTAs provide multimedia descriptions for other services.

### Functional Integration
Orbitz enables functional integration with suppliers through a Jini-enabled Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). Expedia and Travelocity use Web Services for functional integration. SOA allows for dynamic discovery and use of services over a network, where loosely coupled and highly interoperable services are available to other participants in a standardized way. While Web Services and Jini technology both support service-oriented architectures, they differ in their implementation standards. Expedia and Travelocity use Web Services Description Language (WSDL), Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI), and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). Orbitz, on the other hand, uses the Jini framework, which also defines standard ways for describing and accessing software components.

### Current Tourism Information Systems
Tourism information systems, such as Computerized Reservation Systems (CRS), GDS, Hotel Distribution Systems (HDS), and websites, are essential for providing access to tourism information. A CRS is a central reservation system used by travel suppliers, enabling travel agencies to find and book what customers are looking for. GDSs integrate tourism information from various sources, including airlines, hotels, car rentals, and cruises. HDSs work with GDSs to provide automated sales and booking services for the hotel industry.

### Integration Challenges
Integrating these systems is crucial but challenging. Issues such as system heterogeneity, syntactic heterogeneity, structural heterogeneity, and semantic heterogeneity must be addressed. System and syntactic heterogeneity arise from different hardware platforms, operating systems, and data representation. Structural heterogeneity involves different data models and schemas. Semantic heterogeneity arises when the meaning of data is formalized differently across systems.

### Web Services and Semantics
Web services and semantics offer solutions to these integration challenges. Web services provide a standard mechanism for communication across diverse platforms, systems, and networks, enabling seamless integration. Semantics ensure an agreed understanding of data between Web services, promoting interoperability. These technologies allow for the development of flexible and dynamic packaging applications, reducing the cost and effort of systems integration.

### Summary of Strategies
- **Expedia**: High level of customization and international market expansion.
- **Travelocity**: Limited customization capabilities with a focus on international market expansion.
- **Orbitz**: Focus on the US market with high customization of customer communication and a flexible integration architecture independent of GDS, leading to cost advantages.

By leveraging Web services and semantics, modern travel agencies can better support the dynamic composition of travel packages, integrating distributed tourism information systems and providing a seamless experience for customers.
