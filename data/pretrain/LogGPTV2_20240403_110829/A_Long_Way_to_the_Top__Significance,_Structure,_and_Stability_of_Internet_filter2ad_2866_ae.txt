10, 50, and 100 DNS queries per RIPE Atlas probe per day [115]. The
resulting ranks, stabilised after several days of measurement, are
depicted in Figure 5. A main insight is that the number of probes
has a much stronger influence than the query volume per probe:
10k probes at 1 query per day (a total of 10k queries) achieve a rank
of 38k, while 1000 probes at 100 queries per day (a total of 100k
queries) only achieve rank 199k.
It is a reasonable and considerate choice to base the ranking
mechanism mainly on the number of unique sources, as it makes
the ranking less susceptible to individual heavy hitters.
Upon stopping our measurements, our test domains quickly
(within 1-2 days) disappeared from the list.
TTL Influence: To test whether the Umbrella list normalises
the potential effects of TTL values, we query DNS names with 5
different TTL values from 1000 probes at a 900s interval [116]. We
could not determine any significant effect of the TTL values: all 5
domains maintain a distance of less than 1k list places over time.
This is coherent with our previous observation that the Umbrella
rank is mainly determined from the number of clients and not the
query volume per client: as the TTL volume would mainly impact
the query volume per client, its effect should be marginal.
7.3 Majestic
The Majestic Million top list is based on a custom web crawler
mainly used for commercial link intelligence [117]. Initially, Ma-
jestic ranked sites by the raw number of referring domains. As
this had an undesired outcome, the link count was normalised by
the count of referring /24-IPv4-subnets to limit the influence of
single IP addresses [118]. The list is calculated using 90 days of

and unreachable, but still commonly appearing at high ranks in
Umbrella, probably through requests from legacy clients.
This also highlights a challenge in Majestic’s ranking mechanism:
while counting the number of links to a certain website is quite
stable over time, it also reacts slowly to domain closure.
Tracking IPv6 adoption has been the subject of several scien-
tific studies such as [126, 127]. We compare IPv6 adoption across
top lists and the general population, for which we count the num-
ber of domains that return at least one routed IPv6 address as an
AAAA record or within a chain of up to 10 CNAMEs. At 11–13%,
we find IPv6 enablement across top lists to significantly exceed the
general population of domains at 4%. Also, the highest adoption lies
with Umbrella, a good indication for IPv6 adoption: when the most
frequently resolved DNS names support IPv6, many subsequent
content requests are enabled to use IPv6.
CAA Adoption: Exemplary for other record types, we also
investigate the adoption of Certification Authority Authorization
(CAA) records in top lists and the general population. CAA is a
rather new record type, and has become mandatory for CAs to
check before certificate issuance, cf., [122, 128]. We measure CAA
adoption as described in [122], i.e., the count of base domains with
an issue or issuewild set. Similar to IPv6 adoption, we find CAA
adoption among top lists (1–2%) to significantly exceed adoption
among the general population at 0.1%. Even more stunning, the
Top 1k lists feature a CAA adoption of up to 28%, distorting the
0.1% in the general population by two magnitudes.
Takeaway: The DNS-focused results above highlight that top
lists may introduce a picture where results significantly differ from
the general population, a popularity bias to be kept in mind. Figure 6
also shows that Umbrella, and recently Alexa, can have different
results when using a different day. The daily differences, ranging,
e.g., from 1.5–1.8% of CAA adoption around a mean of 1.7% for
Alexa, are not extreme, but should be accounted for.
8.1.2 Hosting Infrastructure Perspective. Domains can be hosted by
users themselves, by hosting companies, or a variety of CDNs. The
hosting landscape is subject to a body of research that is using top
lists to obtain target domains. Here, we study the share of hosting
infrastructures in different top lists.
CDN Prevalence: We start by studying the prevalence of CDNs
in top lists and the general population of all com/net/org domains.
Since many CDNs use DNS CNAME records, we perform daily
DNS resolutions in April 2018, querying all domains both raw
www-prefixed. We match the observed CNAME records against a
list of CNAME patterns for 77 CDNs [129] to identify CDN use.
We first observe that the prevalence of CDNs differs by list and
domain rank (see Table 5), with all Top 1M lists exceeding the
general population by at least a factor of 2, and all Top 1k lists
exceeding the general population by at least a factor of 20. When

grouping the CDN ratio per list by weekdays (see Figure 7a), we
observe minor influences of weekends vs. weekdays due to the top
list dynamics described in §6.2.
After adoption of CDNs in general, we study the structure of
CDN adoption. We analyse the top 5 CDNs and show their distribu-
tion in Figure 7 to study if the relative share is stable over different
lists. We thus show the fraction of domains using one of the top 5
CDNs for both a subset of the Top 1k and the entire list of Top 1M
domains per list. We first observe that the relative share of the top
5 CDNs differs by list and rank (see Figure 7b), but is generally very
high at >80%. The biggest discrepancy is between using a top list
and focusing on the general population of com/net/org domains.
Google dominates the general population with a share of 71.17%
due to many (private) Google-hosted sites. Domains in top lists are
more frequently hosted by typical CDNs (e.g., Akamai). Grouping
the CDN share per list by weekday in Figure 7c shows a strong
weekend/weekday pattern for Alexa, due to the rank dynamics dis-
cussed in §6.2). Interestingly, the weekend days have a higher share
of Google DNS, indicating that more privately-hosted domains are
visited on the weekend.
These observations highlight that using a top list or not has
significant influence on the top 5 CDNs observed, and, if using
Alexa, the day of list creation as well.
ASes: We next analyse the distribution of Autonomous Systems
(AS) that announce a DNS name’s A record in BGP, as per Route
Views data from the day of the measurement, obtained from [130].
First, we study the AS diversity by counting the number of different
ASes hit by the different lists. We observe lists to experience large
differences in the number of unique ASes (cf., Table 5); while Alexa
Top 1M hits the most ASes, i.e., 19511 on average, Umbrella Top 1M
hits the fewest, i.e., 16922 on average. To better understand which
ASes contribute the most IPs, we next focus on studying the top
ASes. Figure 7d shows the top 5 ASes for the Top 1k and Top 1M
domains of each list, as well as the set of com/net/org domains. We
observe that both the set and share of involved ASes differ by list.
We note that the general share of the top 5 ASes is 40% in the
general population, compared to an average of 53% in the Top 1k
and an average of 27% in the Top 1M lists.
In terms of structure, we further observe that GoDaddy (AS26496)
clearly dominates the general population with a share of 25.99%,
while it only accounts for 2.74% on the Alexa Top 1M and for 4.45%
on the Majestic Top 1M.
While Alexa and Majestic share a somewhat similar distribution
for both the Top 1M and Top 1k lists, Umbrella offers a quite differ-
ent view, with a high share of Google/AWS hosted domains, which
also relates to the CDN analysis above.
This view is also eye-opening for other measurement studies:
with a significant share of a population hosted by different 5 ASes,
it is of no surprise that certain higher layer characteristics differ.
8.2 TLS
In line with the prevalence of TLS studies amongst the surveyed top
list papers in §3, we next investigate TLS adoption among lists and
the general population. To probe for TLS support, we instruct zgrab
to visit each domain via HTTPS for one day per list in May 2018. As
in the previous section, we measure all domains with and without
www prefix (except for Umbrella that contains subdomains), as
we found greater coverage for these domains. We were able to
successfully establish TLS connections with 74.65% of the Alexa,
62.89% of the Majestic, 43.05% of the Umbrella, and 36.69% of the
com/net/org domains (cf., Table 5). For Top 1k domains, TLS support
further increases by 15–30% per list.
These results show TLS support to be most pronounced among
Alexa-listed domains, and that support in top lists generally exceeds
the general population.
HSTS: As one current research topic [21], we study the preva-
lence of HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) among TLS enabled
domains. We define a domain to be HSTS–enabled if the domain
provides a valid HSTS header with a max-age setting >0. Out of the
TLS-enabled domains, 12.17% of the Alexa, 11.65% of the Umbrella,
8.44% of the Majestic, and 7.63% of the com/net/org domains pro-
vide HSTS support (see Table 5). Only inspecting Top 1k domains
again increases support significantly to 22.9% for Alexa, 13.0% for
Umbrella, and 27.4% for Majestic. HSTS support is, again, over-
represented in top lists.
8.3 HTTP/2 Adoption
One academic use of top lists is to study the adoption of upcom-
ing protocols, e.g., HTTP/2 [125, 131]. The motivation for probing
top listed domains can be based on the assumption that popular
domains are more likely to adopt new protocols and are thus promis-
ing targets to study. We thus exemplify this effect and the influence
of different top lists by probing domains in top lists and the general
population for their HTTP/2 adoption.

Scheitle et al.
we have observed in §8 that almost all conceivable measurements
suffer significant bias when using a Top 1M list, and excessive bias
in terms of magnitudes when using a Top 1k list. This indicates
that domains in top lists exhibit behaviour significantly different
from the general population—quantitative insights based on top
list domains likely will not generalise.
Second, we have shown that top lists can significantly change
from day to day, rendering results of one-off measurements un-
stable. A similar effect is that lists may be structurally different
on weekends and weekdays, yielding differences in results purely
based on the day of week when a list was downloaded.
Third, the choice of a certain top list can significantly influence
measurement results as well, e.g., for CDN or AS structure (cf.,
§8.1.2), which stems from different lists having different sampling
biases. While these effects can be desired, e.g., to find many domains
that adopt a certain new technology, it leads to bad generalisation
of results to “the Internet”, and results obtained from measuring
top lists must be interpreted very carefully.
9.1 Recommendation for Top List Use
Based on our observations, we develop specific recommendations
for the use of top lists. §3 has revealed that top lists are used for
different purposes in diverse fields of research. The impact of the
specific problems we have discussed will differ by study purpose,
which is why we consider the following a set of core questions to
be considered by study authors—and not a definite guideline.
Match Choice of List to Study Purpose: Based on a precise
understanding of what the domains in a list represent, an appropri-
ate list type should be carefully chosen for a study. For example, the
Umbrella list represents DNS names queried by many individual
clients using OpenDNS (not only PCs, but also mobile devices and
IoT devices), some bogus, some non-existent, but overall a repre-
sentation of typical DNS traffic, and may form a good base for DNS
