### 1. DNS Query Volume and Probe Influence

We conducted measurements using RIPE Atlas probes, with each probe issuing 10, 50, and 100 DNS queries per day [115]. After several days of measurement, the resulting ranks stabilized and are depicted in Figure 5. A key finding is that the number of probes has a much stronger influence on the rank than the query volume per probe. For example, 10,000 probes each issuing 1 query per day (a total of 10,000 queries) achieved a rank of 38,000, while 1,000 probes each issuing 100 queries per day (a total of 100,000 queries) only achieved a rank of 199,000.

Basing the ranking mechanism primarily on the number of unique sources is a reasonable and considerate choice, as it makes the ranking less susceptible to individual heavy hitters. When we stopped our measurements, our test domains quickly disappeared from the list within 1-2 days.

### 2. TTL Influence

To investigate whether the Umbrella list normalizes the potential effects of TTL values, we queried DNS names with five different TTL values from 1,000 probes at a 900-second interval [116]. We found no significant effect of the TTL values: all five domains maintained a distance of less than 1,000 list places over time. This observation aligns with our previous finding that the Umbrella rank is mainly determined by the number of clients rather than the query volume per client. Since TTL values primarily impact the query volume per client, their effect on the overall ranking is marginal.

### 3. Majestic Million Top List

The Majestic Million top list is based on a custom web crawler used for commercial link intelligence [117]. Initially, Majestic ranked sites by the raw number of referring domains. However, this approach led to undesired outcomes, so the link count was normalized by the count of referring /24-IPv4-subnets to limit the influence of single IP addresses [118]. The list is calculated using 90 days of data.

### 4. Internet Measurement Characteristics

Table 5 compares internet measurement characteristics across top lists and the general population, typically given as µ ± σ. For each cell, we highlight if it significantly (50% and 6σ) exceeds ▲ or falls behind ▼ the base value (1k/1M, 1M/com/net/org), or not ■. In almost all cases (▲ and ▼), top lists significantly distort the characteristics of the general population.

### 5. DNS Characteristics

Figure 6 illustrates DNS characteristics in the Top 1M lists and the general population of about 158 million domains. We find that IPv6 adoption and CAA adoption among top lists significantly exceed the general population. For example, IPv6 enablement across top lists is 11-13%, compared to 4% in the general population. Similarly, CAA adoption among top lists is 1-2%, compared to 0.1% in the general population. The Top 1k lists feature even higher CAA adoption, up to 28%.

### 6. Hosting Infrastructure Perspective

Domains can be hosted by users, hosting companies, or CDNs. We studied the share of hosting infrastructures in different top lists. The prevalence of CDNs differs by list and domain rank, with all Top 1M lists exceeding the general population by at least a factor of 2, and all Top 1k lists exceeding the general population by at least a factor of 20. The relative share of the top 5 CDNs also varies by list and rank, but is generally very high, often above 80%.

### 7. Autonomous Systems (ASes)

We analyzed the distribution of ASes that announce a DNS name’s A record in BGP. Alexa Top 1M hits the most ASes, averaging 19,511, while Umbrella Top 1M hits the fewest, averaging 16,922. The top 5 ASes differ by list, with the general share of the top 5 ASes being 40% in the general population, 53% in the Top 1k, and 27% in the Top 1M lists.

### 8. TLS Adoption

We investigated TLS adoption among lists and the general population. We found TLS support to be most pronounced among Alexa-listed domains, with 74.65% of Alexa, 62.89% of Majestic, 43.05% of Umbrella, and 36.69% of com/net/org domains supporting TLS. For Top 1k domains, TLS support increases by 15-30% per list.

### 9. HTTP/2 Adoption

One use of top lists is to study the adoption of new protocols like HTTP/2. Popular domains are more likely to adopt new protocols, making them promising targets for study. We found that HTTP/2 adoption is overrepresented in top lists, with significant differences between different top lists.

### 10. Recommendations for Top List Use

Based on our observations, we recommend the following:
- **Match Choice of List to Study Purpose**: Choose an appropriate list type based on a precise understanding of what the domains in the list represent.
- **Consider Day-to-Day Variability**: Be aware that top lists can change significantly from day to day, which can affect the stability of results.
- **Understand Structural Differences**: Different top lists have different sampling biases, which can significantly influence measurement results.

These recommendations aim to help researchers interpret results obtained from measuring top lists more carefully and accurately.
