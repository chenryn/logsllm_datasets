### What problem does this feature solve?
Macs and PCs use different keyboard modifiers for the same tasks, i.e. `CTRL
C` and `CMD C` or in keyboard event terms `.ctrl` and `.meta`.
Because you can't add modifiers dynamically, you have to build handlers
yourself, losing out on the built in sugar:
    function onKeyPress (event) {
      const isCopy = event.key === 'c' && ((isMac && event.metaKey) || event.ctrlKey)
      ...
    }
Or use a plugin and do something like:
### What does the proposed API look like?
I'm proposing several new cross-platform modifiers that would make it much
easier to work with cross-platform keyboard shortcuts, on top of the existing
excellent keyboard event handling:
  * `action` \- substitute the correct modifier key `ctrl` or `meta` depending on platform
  * `mac` \- limit the modifier to mac only
  * `win` \- limit the modifier to windows / linux only
That would allow combinations like so:
    // automatic
    // manual, perhaps with different handling based on platform
