User: I run MAC OS X. 
So I have completed a python script that essentially parses a few sites online, and uploads a particular file to an online server.  Essentially, I wish to run this script automatically from my computer about 20 times a day.  Is there a solution to schedule this script to run at fixed time points everyday? Does this require compiling the python code into a .exe file?
Thanks a lot!
Assistant: The OS provides a tool called 'cron' that's for exactly this purpose. You shouldn't need to modify your script at all to make use of it. 
At a terminal command prompt, type man cron for more info.
