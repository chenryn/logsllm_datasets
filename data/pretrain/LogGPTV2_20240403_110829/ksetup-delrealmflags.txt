### ksetup delrealmflags

**Description:**
The `ksetup delrealmflags` command is used to remove specific realm flags from a specified Kerberos realm. Realm flags control various features and behaviors within the realm.

**Syntax:**
```shell
ksetup /delrealmflags <Realm> [sendaddress] [tcpsupported] [delegate] [ncsupported] [rc4]
```

**Parameters:**
- **<Realm>:** Specifies the uppercase DNS name of the realm, such as `CORP.CONTOSO.COM`. This is the default realm or the one listed under `Realm=` when running `ksetup`.

**Realm Flags:**
| Value | Flag          | Description                                                                 |
|-------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0xF   | All           | All realm flags are set.                                                    |
| 0x00  | None          | No realm flags are set, and no additional features are enabled.             |
| 0x01  | sendaddress   | The IP address will be included within the ticket-granting tickets.         |
| 0x02  | tcpsupported  | Both the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are supported in this realm. |
| 0x04  | delegate      | Everyone in this realm is trusted for delegation.                           |
| 0x08  | ncsupported   | This realm supports name canonicalization, which allows for DNS and Realm naming standards. |
| 0x80  | rc4           | This realm supports RC4 encryption to enable cross-realm trust, which allows for the use of TLS. |

**Registry Storage:**
Realm flags are stored in the Windows Registry under the following key:
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Kerberos\Domains\
```
This entry does not exist by default. You can use the `ksetup addrealmflags` command to populate the registry with the desired flags.

**Viewing Realm Flags:**
You can view the available and set realm flags by using the following commands:
- `ksetup`: Displays the current configuration.
- `ksetup /dumpstate`: Provides detailed information about the Kerberos configuration, including realm flags.

**Examples:**

1. **List Available Realm Flags:**
   To list the available realm flags for the realm `CONTOSO`, type:
   ```shell
   ksetup /listrealmflags CONTOSO
   ```

2. **Remove Specific Realm Flags:**
   To remove the `ncsupported` and `delegate` flags from the realm `CONTOSO`, type:
   ```shell
   ksetup /delrealmflags CONTOSO ncsupported delegate
   ```

3. **Verify Removal of Realm Flags:**
   After removing the flags, you can verify the changes by running:
   ```shell
   ksetup
   ```
   Look for the `Realm flags =` line in the output to confirm the removal.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage and configure the realm flags for your Kerberos realms.
