### Optimizing RetroPie on Your Raspberry Pi

#### Initial Setup
RetroPie is built on Raspbian, so your first step should be to configure the device using `sudo raspi-config`. If you need a refresher, refer to the `raspi-config` sections in Chapter 4.

Next, update the system software and reboot:
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo reboot
```

**Note: Enhancing Performance**
Consider adjusting the Pi’s memory split to favor graphics over processor performance and enable overclocking. These topics are covered in detail in Chapter 18, "Raspberry Pi Overclocking."

#### Transferring ROMs to Your Raspberry Pi
Raspbian enables Secure Shell (SSH) connections by default, allowing you to use a Secure Copy (SCP) utility to transfer ROM files to the Pi.

**Steps:**

1. **Exit Emulation Station:**
   - Press `F4` to exit to a Terminal prompt.
   - Type `ifconfig eth0` to obtain the Pi’s IP address.

2. **Connect to Your Pi:**
   - On a remote computer, use FileZilla, Cyberduck, or another SFTP client to connect to your Pi.
   - Use SFTP, not FTP, as the connection method.
   - The default username and password are `pi` and `raspberry`, respectively.
   - Refer to Figure 13.3 for setting up a new stored connection in FileZilla.

3. **Navigate to the ROM Directory:**
   - Navigate to `/home/pi/RetroPie/roms`.
   - RetroPie creates folders for each supported console video game platform.

4. **Upload ROM Files:**
   - Drag and drop your ROM files into the appropriate subfolders.
   - Ensure you upload the actual binary ROM files (e.g., `.nes` for NES, `.bin` for Atari 2600).
   - Refer to Figure 13.4 for an example of where ROMs should be stored.

5. **Start Emulation Station:**
   - From the Terminal prompt, issue the command:
     ```bash
     emulationstation
     ```
   - Remember that Linux is case-sensitive, so use `emulationstation` exactly as written.

**Default Games Included:**
- Cave Story
- Doom
- Duke Nukem 3D (demo)

You can also start the LinApple Apple II emulator and the rpix86 DOS 5.0 emulator to run old Apple II games.

#### Troubleshooting ROM Detection
If you encounter issues with ROM detection, check the `~/.emulationstation/es_systems.cfg` configuration file. The key parameters to verify are:

- **PATH:** The default location where Emulation Station expects to find game ROMs for each platform.
- **EXTENSION:** Ensure your ROMs have the correct file extensions for proper detection.

**Note: Showing File Extensions in Windows**
- In Windows 7 or 8, open the Folder Options Control Panel, navigate to the View tab, and disable the option to hide extensions for known file types.
- In OS X, choose Finder > Preferences, navigate to the Advanced pane, and enable the option to show all filename extensions.

After making any changes, save the file and reboot your Pi before attempting another scrape.

#### Setting Up Controls
Emulation Station is optimized for joystick/gamepad-based control, but you can also edit keyboard mappings.

**Edit Keyboard Mappings:**
- Exit to a Terminal prompt and use the following command to edit the `retroarch.cfg` file:
  ```bash
  sudo nano ~/RetroPie/configs/all/retroarch.cfg
  ```
- Alternatively, use your SFTP utility to download, edit, and reupload the file.
- Look for the line starting with `# Keyboard input` and edit the key mapping values as needed.

**Configure Joystick Mappings:**
1. **Navigate to the Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/RetroPie/emulators/RetroArch/tools
   ```

2. **Run the Configuration Utility:**
   ```bash
   ./retroarch-joyconfig >> ~/RetroPie/configs/all/retroarch.cfg
   ```

3. **Assign Bindings:**
   - Follow the prompts to assign bindings for each command by pressing the appropriate button on your joystick.
   - Refer to Figure 13.6 for an example.

**Additional Joystick Mapping:**
Add the following lines to `retroarch.cfg` to allow exiting the active emulator and returning to Emulation Station:
```bash
input_enable_hotkey_btn = "X"
input_exit_emulator_btn="Y"
```
Substitute `X` and `Y` with the joystick buttons you will press simultaneously to exit the emulator.

#### Playing Your Games
- **Reboot or Start Emulation Station:**
  - Reboot your Raspberry Pi or type `emulationstation` from the Terminal prompt.
- **Navigate Menus:**
  - Use the `LEFT` and `RIGHT` controls to scroll through emulators.
  - Use the `UP` and `DOWN` controls to scroll through game lists.
  - Use the `ACCEPT` and `SELECT` controls to launch and start games.
- **Exit Emulator:**
  - Use `ESC` or your custom joystick mapping to exit the emulator and return to Emulation Station.

Refer to Figure 13.7 for a typical game screen.

#### Installing Useful Add-Ons
Media scrapers can enhance your retro gaming experience by providing box art and game descriptions.

**Install ES-Scraper:**
1. **Navigate to the Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd
   cd RetroPie/supplementary
   ```

2. **Clone and Run the Setup Script:**
   ```bash
   git clone http://github.com/elpender/ES-scraper
   cd
   cd RetroPie-Setup
   sudo ./retropie_setup.sh
   ```

3. **Choose Installation:**
   - Select `Setup` if you have already run one of these installations.
   - In the `Choose task` dialog, select `Run ‘ES-scraper’`.

4. **Scrape ROMs:**
   - Select `(Re-)scrape of the ROMs directory` to perform an immediate ROM discovery and metadata download.

When the process is complete, cancel out of the RetroPie Setup script, reboot your Pi, and enjoy the new artwork. Refer to Figure 13.9 for an example of downloaded game descriptions and box art.

#### Choosing the Right Joystick
RetroPie does an excellent job of detecting USB joysticks and gamepads. For a classic experience, consider using a Logitech Rumblepad 2 or a reproduction controller with native USB connectivity.

**USB Adapters and Reproductions:**
- **RetroZone** sells USB adapters for various console controllers.
- **Tomee** and **Retrolink** offer reproductions of old controllers with native USB connectivity.
- **PetRockBlog** provides a GPIO adapter for original SNES controllers, including assembly instructions and pinout schematics.

Refer to Figures 13.10, 13.11, and 13.12 for more details on available controllers and adapters.

### Chapter 14: Raspberry Pi Minecraft Server
