constant. This observation was further veriﬁed by the
click URLs for sponsored ads from the same ad network,
which we obtained by registering with Advertise as
a publisher (see Appendix for details on search sites and
sponsored click URLs).
The above example shows that we can leverage the or-
dered sequence of URL patterns to determine the pres-
ence of a monetization option. Such a sequence is a
“stamp” we utilize to expand our seed set to ﬁnd other il-
licit monetization chains within the dataset collected by
our crawlers. Following we describe the methodology

for clustering and generalizing URLs from a monetiza-
tion party, and extracting the stamps from the URL pat-
terns.
URL-IP Cluster (UIC) generation. A speciﬁc URL of
a monetization party (ad network, trafﬁc systems, etc.)
can be too speciﬁc for ﬁngerprinting its monetization
activity. An ad network can have many afﬁliated web-
sites and each site may have multiple domains and IP
addresses. To utilize such a URL for generating a stamp,
we ﬁrst need to generalize it across those domains, ad-
dresses and potential variations in its ﬁle path and other
parameters. To this end, we clustered related URLs into
URL-IP clusters (UIC). A UIC includes a set of IP ad-
dresses for related hosts and the invariant part of the URL
(without the host name) across all members in the clus-
ter. The former describes the ownership of this set of
URLs and the latter represents their common function-
ality, which together ﬁngerprints a monetization option
with regard to an ad network or a trafﬁc system.
To cluster a group of URLs into UICs, we ﬁrst ex-
tracted the host part of a URL, replacing it with all IPs
of the domain, and then broke the remaining part of the
URL into tokens. A token is either the full path of the
URL including ﬁle name (which is typically very short
for a monetization URL) or an argument. The value of
the argument was removed, as it can be too speciﬁc (e.g.
keyword and publisher ID). Over those IP-token sets, we
ran a clustering algorithm based upon Jaccard indices for
both IPs and tokens, as follows:
1. Each URL (including an IP set and a token set) is
ﬁrst assigned to a unique UIC.
2. Two UICs are merged together when both their
IP sets and token sets are close enough (Jaccard indices
above their corresponding thresholds).
3. Repeat step 2 until no more UICs can be merged.
A pair of thresholds are used here to determine the
similarity of two IP sets (Tip) and two token sets (Ttok)
In our research, we set Tip to 0.1 and
respectively.
Ttok to 0.5, and ran the algorithm to cluster all the
URLs on the 1.2M monetization chains collected by our
crawlers. By replacing individual URLs with their cor-
responding UICs, we obtained 429K unique generalized
chains, which were further used to detect illicit activities.
Stamp extraction. The stamps for different moneti-
zation options were extracted from seed monetization
chains, after generalizing them using the aforementioned
UICs. Speciﬁcally, we utilized 715 UIC chains (general-
ized from the 1,015 chains reported in Table 3) to ﬁn-
gerprint 11 ad networks and trafﬁc systems, with one
stamp created for all the campaigns associated with a
given ad network or trafﬁc system. For this purpose,
we applied a 2-fold cross-validation approach to gener-
ate stamps and assess their effectiveness. Speciﬁcally,
we randomly split the UIC chains for each campaign
into two equal sized sets, one for stamp extraction (train-
ing) and the other for stamp evaluation (test). Over the
training set, we determined a stamp by traversing each
UIC chain backwards and selecting the sequence of UICs
shared by all the chains involving a certain ad network or
trafﬁc system. Typically the longest sequence identiﬁed
in this way became the stamp for all the chains going
through its related monetization organization. However,
for a campaign with a small number of UIC chains (e.g.
BingAds), we only utilized the last common UIC (right
before our advertiser’s URL) across all the chains as the
stamp.
All together, our approach generated stamps for 11 ad
networks and trafﬁc systems. Ad network stamps con-
tained on average two UICs while trafﬁc system stamps
were mostly one UIC in length.
4.2 Evaluation
False negative. Using all the 11 stamps generated from
the training set, we analyzed all the monetization chains
within the test set. For each campaign, its stamp was
found to match all of its monetization chains in the test
set and thus no false negative was observed.
False positives. We further evaluated the false positive
rate that could be introduced by the stamps on a dataset
containing 768M redirection chains collected by crawl-
ing the top 1M Alexa websites [2] Jan 21-31, 2014. The
purpose here is to understand whether a redirection chain
not involving clicks or trafﬁc selling can be misidentiﬁed
as a related monetization chain and whether the mone-
tization chains of one ad network or trafﬁc system can
be classiﬁed as those of another party. By applying our
stamps on the dataset, we ﬂagged 12 chains as matches
to click stamps and another 19 chains as matches to traf-

ﬁc stamps. Upon manually analyzing the 12 click chains,
we found that all of them were actually fraudulent clicks
generated by parking services (10 chains) and a trafﬁc/ad
network named CPX24 (2 chains). CPX24 in our case
generated clicks on its own hosted ads when trafﬁc from
publishers ﬂowed in. For the 19 trafﬁc chains, they were
indeed PPR monetization chains. Further, by manually
searching for a set of ad network speciﬁc domain names
such as affinity.com within the Alexa dataset, we
discovered a number of redirection chains going through
the same ad networks ﬁngerprinted by our stamps but
not involving any clicks (e.g. ad display and conversion
tracking URLs). None of them were misidentiﬁed by our
stamps as click-based monetization chains.
Discussion. Our evaluation shows that the stamps gen-
erated over UICs accurately capture all monetization
chains associated with a speciﬁc ad network or trafﬁc
system. However, those stamps are designed for ana-
lyzing the trafﬁc through individual organizations, which
is enough for our purpose of understanding the scope
and magnitude of fraudulent activities, not for detecting
those operations on any monetization chains, particularly
those belonging to other monetization parties. Also note
that we cannot use existing ad-blocking lists such as Ea-
syList [26] to serve our goal, due to its limitations: ﬁrst,
EasyList does not distinguish between a click and an im-
pression (ad display); second, search websites used by ad
networks to deliver clicks are not covered by the block
list; ﬁnally, the list fails to include the hosts and URLs of
trafﬁc monetization systems.
5 Measurements
In this section, we report our measurement study on il-
licit parked domain monetization. This study is based
upon a dataset of 1.2M monetization chains collected in
a 5.5-month span. Such data were ﬁrst labeled using the
“stamps” generated (Section 4.1) from the seed data to
identify the monetization options associated with indi-
vidual chains, and then analyzed to understand the perva-
siveness of illicit monetization practices and its ﬁnancial
impact. Here we elaborate on the outcomes of this study.
5.1 Dataset Labeling
Expansion. To perform the measurement study, we
labeled the 1.2M monetization chains collected from
crawling parked domains by “expanding” the 1,015 seed
chains (the ground truth) to this much larger dataset.
Speciﬁcally, we generated UICs over those 1.2M chains,
generalized the seed chains using those UICs, and then
extracted click and trafﬁc stamps from the seeds as de-
scribed in Section 4.1. Matching those stamps to the
generalized UIC chains in the larger dataset (429K UIC
chains), we were able to label 120,290 (28.03%) UIC
chains corresponding to 212,359 (17.1%) URL moneti-
zation chains. The labeled set includes two monetiza-
tion options, PPC (45.7%) and PPR (56.3%) where 2%
of them include both PPR and PPC monetizations on the
same chain as explained later.
Unknown set. Although many chains were success-
fully labeled, there are almost 308K UIC chains in the
dataset not carrying any stamps, which were marked
as “unknown”. Looking into this unknown set through
random sampling, we found that it exhibited consis-
tent patterns related to click delivery and trafﬁc selling
which can be added to the labeled set if we had veri-
ﬁed seed chains. For example, we found many other
ad-nets such as Adknowledge and Bidvertiser
(2.9%), and other trafﬁc monetization systems such as
Adrenalads and ZeroRedirect (19.5%). Partic-
ularly, Sendori, a trafﬁc platform, is widely present,
covering 5.4% of the chains in the dataset. 2.6% of those
chains actually led to domain name marketplaces such as
SnapNames, and a large portion (over 19.7%) of them
stop at some parking services and trafﬁc monetization
platforms (e.g. Skenzo) with error messages indicating
cloaking behavior.
5.2 Monetization Decisions
Over the labeled dataset, we analyzed the parties respon-
sible for such decisions and the way those decisions were
made, based on a categorization of the parked domains
involved.
Monetization decision maker. Finding the party that
chooses a monetization option is important, as it tells us
who is the ultimate culprit for an illicit activity. How-
ever, this is challenging, due to the syndication of mul-
tiple monetization parties, among parking services, ad-
nets and trafﬁc systems. Within our dataset, we found
that these types of syndications are pervasive (49.5%).
As an example, AdLux in Table 7 is actually a syndi-
cate of Advertise, displaying its ads and sharing its
click revenue. In the presence of a syndication, a start-
ing node’s parking service may not be responsible for
the follow-up illicit monetization, which could actually
be performed by one of its syndicates. To this end, we
identify the parking service of the starting node to be
the responsible party of a monetization chain only when
the click or trafﬁc stamp appears right after the starting
node (i.e. parked domain). When there are other enti-
ties between the parked domain and the stamp, we use a
parking-service anchor as described below.
Typically, a parking service funnels the trafﬁc from
its parked domains to a “controller” domain, which we
call a parking service (PS) anchor, for choosing a mon-
etization option. Our idea here is to locate the PS an-
chor right before a click or trafﬁc stamp. When this hap-
pens, the owner of the anchor is clearly responsible for
216  23rd USENIX Security Symposium

the monetization decision. To this end, we picked out
the most prevalent second UICs down individual mone-
tization chains (which is expected to cover over 50% of
all the chains associated with a speciﬁc parking service),
and identiﬁed its ownership using its whois records and
Name Server. Such a UIC is considered to be an anchor
for the parking service.
In our research, we identiﬁed anchors for 4 of the
most prevalent parking services in our set. Some park-
ing services such as PS6 and PS4 launder all the traf-
ﬁc through direct navigation trafﬁc systems (DNTX and
ZeroRedirect respectively) which are owned by the
parent companies of the two parking services. Since
those trafﬁc systems are used by other clients, we did
not consider them to be the anchors of the parking ser-
vice. Using the heuristic described earlier (i.e. direct
link from a parked domain to a stamp) and the list of an-
chors, we assigned each monetization chain to the park-
ing service responsible for the selection of its moneti-
zation option, as illustrated in Table 8. Here the “un-
known” category includes the chains we could not de-
termine the parties responsible for their monetizations,
due to the disconnection between the parked domain
or PS anchor and the click or trafﬁc stamp, with un-
known UICs standing in-between. For example, the
chain in Table 7 was marked as “unknown”, as the known
anchor http://otnnetwork.net/?epl= is sepa-
rated from the ad stamp there.
Impacts of domain categorization. As discussed be-
fore, our research focuses on the redirection chains gen-
erated by 1.2M out of 24M visits to parked domains.
The rest of those visits only resulted in a simple dis-
play of PPC ads, which were less likely to be used for
illicit monetization. The fact that those redirection chains
were so rare to see here can be attributed to IP cloaking.
In the meantime, we believe that this is also caused by
the way that trafﬁc from different domains is monetized.
Speciﬁcally, a parking service like Bodis often clas-
siﬁes domains into “primary” or “secondary”. Primary
domains are those accepted by top-tier search networks
(e.g. Google AdWords) to display their ads while
secondary ones are less trusted, including those serving
malicious content before taken down and the ones related
to typos of trade or brand names. The secondary domains
here are much more likely to lead to redirection chains,
as discovered in our research (illustrated by Figure 4).
Among all domains visited by our crawlers, we found
(using [6]) that only 2.9% of them were considered to
be secondary, which naturally limits the number of the
redirection chains we could observe.
