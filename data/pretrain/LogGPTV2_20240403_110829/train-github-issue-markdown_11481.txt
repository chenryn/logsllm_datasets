I added the glide-3.6.1.jar and YouTubeAndroidPlayerApi.jar to my project,  
Before adding to glide , the youtube player was working clearly, when I added
glide, something went wrong and when I try to open my YouTubePlayerFrag,
onCreate() method I couldn't inflate my xml.
When I remove the glide, everything return normal.
