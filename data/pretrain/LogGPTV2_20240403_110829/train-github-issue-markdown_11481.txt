I have integrated the `glide-3.6.1.jar` and `YouTubeAndroidPlayerApi.jar` into my project. Prior to adding Glide, the YouTube player was functioning correctly. However, after including Glide, I encountered an issue where the XML layout for my `YouTubePlayerFragment` could not be inflated within the `onCreate()` method. When I removed Glide from the project, everything returned to normal.

To summarize:
- The YouTube player worked fine before adding Glide.
- After adding Glide, the `YouTubePlayerFragment` failed to inflate its XML layout in the `onCreate()` method.
- Removing Glide resolved the issue.
