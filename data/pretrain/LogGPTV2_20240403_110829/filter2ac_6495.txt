**ATT&CK ID:** G0045  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** menuPass

**Description:**
menuPass has been known to use the IP address of a global service provider as a proxy for command and control (C2) traffic originating from a compromised victim. This technique helps the threat actor to obfuscate the source of the C2 communications, making it more difficult for defenders to detect and trace the malicious activity.
