User: Is it possible to get .py text file from .exe file generated with cx_Freeze? If yes, how can I prevent it when I generate exe? I don't want that somebody see my python code. Of course anybody will have access to bytecode, but it much harder to disasemblate it.
Assistant: Seems like using cython will make it impossible to get script back.
