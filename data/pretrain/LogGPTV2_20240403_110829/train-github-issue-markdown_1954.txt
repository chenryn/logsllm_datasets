### Stack Overflow Link
I have already asked this question on Stack Overflow:  
[React Stateless Component Children with TypeScript Error: Property 'children' is Missing](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37189910/react-stateless-component-children-with-typescript-error-property-children)

### TypeScript Version
1.8.2

### Code
```typescript
// Presentational Components
const MsgDisplay = ({ msg }: { msg: string }) => (
  <div>{msg}</div> // Will be more complex in the future
);

const RowDisplay = ({ data, children }: { data: any, children: React.ReactNode }) => (
  <div>
    {/* Other content */}
    {children}
    {/* Other content */}
  </div>
);

// Container Component
class MyContainer extends React.Component {
  public render() {
    return (
      <RowDisplay data={{}}>
        <MsgDisplay msg="Hello, World!" />
      </RowDisplay>
    );
  }
}
```

### Expected Behavior
The code should compile without errors.

### Actual Behavior
The TypeScript compiler throws the following error:
```
error TS2324: Property 'children' is missing in type 'IntrinsicAttributes & { data: any; children: any; }'.
```

It appears that the `children` prop is not being recognized when passed using JSX notation.
