-> asked on S/O here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37189910/react-stateless-component-children-with-typescript-error-property-children no responses so far.
**TypeScript Version:**  
1.8.2
**Code**
    // presentational components
    const MsgDisplay = ({msg}) => (
        {msg} // will be more complicated later
      )
    const RowDisplay = ({data, children}) => (
        ...
        { children }
        ...
      )
    // container component
    public render() {
        return (
        )
      }
**Expected behavior:**
Should compile.
**Actual behavior:**
Complains that `error TS2324: Property 'children' is missing in type
'IntrinsicAttributes & { data: any; children: any; }'.`
Seems it can't see the children being passed in jsx notation.
