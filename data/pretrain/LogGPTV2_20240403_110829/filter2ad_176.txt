Location Leaks on the GSM Air 
Interface

Problem definition 
•  Large array of towers broadcasting messages 
–  Can those messages reveal a phone’s location? 
•  Given a person’s phone number 
–  can we locate the tower they are attached to in a GSM 
network? 
•  GSM: dominant protocol worldwide  
–  Analysis of layer 2/3 messages only. 
•  No collaboration from the service provider. 
•  No support from apps.

Bounding the LAC 
•  LACs can be very large. 
–  T-Mobile LAC 747d: 100km2  
•  Used a wall-following algorithm, 
road permitting. 
•  Call to MS on NW corner. 
•  Observed paging request on 
SE corner.

Finding individual towers 
•  Find individual towers with a hill-climbing algorithm. 
–  Non-uniform RF attenuation. 
–  Overshoot by 50m to avoid local maximum.

Start 
–  Less than 0.6% of paging requests are not type 1. 
–  Available bandwidth for additional pages. 
–  Human trajectories are predictable. 
•  Continuous time mixes. 
–  Switch TMSI at least once per page. 
Defenses 
•  Page multiple areas. 
•  phone/TMSI bitwise unlinkable. 
–  Prevent traffic analysis. 
•  Cover traffic. 
•  Add exponential delay to paging requests. 
leak location information. 
•  Leaks observable with  
–  readily available equipment equipment, 
–  no (direct) help from the service provider. 
Conclusion 
•  Systems with broadcast paging protocols could 
•  Proposed low cost fixes. 
•  Responsible disclosures.
