when connecting to legacy generation networks, the SUPI or IMSI can be
visible.

identiﬁers are often used instead. The Globally Unique Tem-
porary Identiﬁer (GUTI) can be thought of as a temporary
replacement for an SUPI. Once a phone attaches to the net-
work, the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF)
generates a GUTI value that is sent to the UE, which stores
the value. The UE uses the GUTI rather than the SUPI when
it attaches to the network in the future. The GUTI can be
changed by the AMF periodically. Ephemeral identiﬁers such
as GUTIs may be susceptible to de-anonymization attacks
given weaknesses in their implementations. For instance, prior
work has found that GUTIs are often predictable with consis-
tent patterns, thus offering little privacy [33], but this can be
remedied with a lightweight ﬁx that we expect will be used go-
ing forward. We view such mitigations as complementary to
PGPP in order to construct a layered solution for user privacy.
The 5G network is IP-based, meaning UEs must be given
IP addresses in order to connect. IPs can be either statically
or dynamically assigned to UEs. Statically assigned IPs are
stored in a backend core database. During the attach proce-
dure, the AMF retrieves the static IP address assigned to the
UE from the backend. Conversely, dynamic addresses are
assigned by the SMF when the UE attaches. Providers can
associate a user with an IP address in the network by monitor-
ing trafﬁc at the UPF, which offers a convenient location to
place a network tap.
In order to connect with the gNodeB over the NG-RAN,
UE’s must be assigned radio resources at layer 2, includ-
ing a temporary unique identiﬁer, the RNTI. Prior work has
shown that layer 2 information used on the NG-RAN can
be used to link RNTIs with temporary identiﬁers at higher
layers (e.g., GUTIs) provided the attacker knows the GUTI
beforehand [65]. This attack is speciﬁc to the coverage area
of a single cell, and can be mitigated by changing the GUTI
frequently, as discussed in [33].
User location information. Cellular networks maintain
knowledge of the physical location of each UE. Location
information is necessary to support mobility and to quickly
ﬁnd the UE when there is an incoming call, SMS, or data
for a user. The mechanism used to locate a UE is known as
“paging” and it relies on logical groupings of similarly located
gNodeB’s known as “tracking areas” (TAs). Each gNodeB is
assigned to a single TA. TAs can be thought of as broadcast
domains for paging trafﬁc. If there is incoming data for an
idle UE, the paging procedure is used, where the network
broadcasts a paging message to all gNodeBs in the user’s last-
known TA. Prior work has shown that the paging mechanism
can be leveraged by attackers that know an identiﬁer of the
victim (e.g., phone number, WhatsApp ID) to generate paging
messages intended for the victim, which enables an unprivi-
leged attacker to identify a speciﬁc user’s location [44]. From
an external perspective, the vantage point of remote servers on
the web can also be leveraged to localize mobile users given
timing information from applications on their devices [69].
Cellular operators often store location metadata for sub-
scriber, giving them the ability to trace user movement and
location history. This bulk surveillance mechanism has been
used to establish a user’s past location by law enforcement [9].
3 Scope
We believe that many designs are possible to increase pri-
vacy in mobile networks, and no architecture, today or in the
future, is likely to provide perfect privacy. Nevertheless, below
we discuss various properties that PGPP strives to achieve.
Prior work examined the security vulnerabilities in modern
cell networks [35,44,68] and revealed a number of ﬂaws in the
architecture itself. In addition, data brokers and major opera-
tors alike have taken advantage of the cellular architecture’s
vulnerabilities to proﬁt off of revealing sensitive user data.
We believe mobile networks should aim to, at a minimum,
provide one or both of the following privacy properties:
• Identity privacy. A network can aim to protect users’
identity. Networks—as well as third party attackers—
identify users through SUPIs, which are intended to be
uniquely identifying.
• Location privacy. A network can aim to protect informa-
tion about the whereabouts of a phone.
Naturally, these privacy properties do not exist in isolation;
they intersect in critical ways. For example, attackers often
aim to learn not only who a user is but where a speciﬁc user
is currently located, or where a user was when a speciﬁc call
was made. Also, the deﬁnition of an attacker or adversary is a
complex one, and depending on context may include individu-
als aiming to steal user data, mobile carriers and data brokers
looking to proﬁt off of user data, governments seeking to per-
form bulk surveillance, law enforcement seeking to monitor
a user with or without due process, and many others. Due
to context dependence, we do not expect all privacy-focused
mobile networks to make the same choice of tradeoffs.
3.1 Cellular privacy threat model
Given the above discussion, we distinguish between bulk
and targeted data collection. We deﬁne bulk collection to
be the collection of information from existing cellular archi-
tecture trafﬁc without the introduction of attack trafﬁc; thus,
bulk collection is passive. Bulk attacks commonly target user
identities (e.g., SUPIs). PGPP’s core aim is to protect against
bulk attacks. Targeted attacks are active and require injec-
tion of trafﬁc to attack speciﬁc targets. Targeted attacks are
often aimed at discovering a victim’s location. We also de-
lineate attacks by the adversary’s capabilities, as they may
have visibility into an entire network (global) versus, for an
unprivileged attacker, some smaller subset of a network’s in-
frastructure (local). Note that we assume trust that the PGPP

operator itself will not actively attempt to thwart PGPP’s pri-
vacy mechanisms (i.e., a global-targeted attack, described be-
low, or maliciously generated non-unique TALs (Section 4.2),
or TALs containing unlikely or non-adjacent TAs). Table 2
gives the taxonomy of attacks.
Mobile carriers and governments are the most common
global-bulk attackers. Such bulk surveillance is common-
place in cellular networks, and has been at the center of recent
lawsuits and privacy concerns. Attacks that employ IMSI
catchers or passively listen to broadcasts using software-
deﬁned radios are considered local-bulk. Here, an IMSI
catcher is only able to monitor phones that connect directly
to it, so its visibility is limited to its radio range. Similarly,
SDR-based passive snooping is only able to monitor nearby
base stations and will miss portions of the network. We de-
sign PGPP with a primary focus on thwarting bulk attacks by
nullifying the value of SUPIs (Section 4.1).
Local-targeted attacks can be carried out by ordinary users
by generating trafﬁc that causes a network to page a victim
(e.g., phone call or data sent to the victim). As local-targeted
attackers do not have visibility into the entire network, they
must rely upon knowledge of the geographic area that is en-
compassed by a tracking area. Due to the prevalence of such
attacks, as an enhancement, an operator can provide function-
ality, in cooperation with the user, that reduces the efﬁcacy of
local-targeted attacks through the use of TALs (Section 4.2).
Global-targeted attacks represent a very powerful attacker
who can actively probe a victim while having global vis-
ibility of the network. We envision defenses against such
attacks would require fundamental changes to to communica-
tion models. PGPP does not mitigate global-targeted attacks
as we focus on immediately deployable solutions; we leave
this to future work.
3.2 Aims
Next we discuss the aims of PGPP by considering several
common questions that arise.
What sort of privacy does PGPP provide? As its name
suggests, PGPP aims to provide “pretty good” privacy; we
don’t believe there is a solution that provides perfect privacy,
causes no service changes (i.e., does not increase latency),
and is incrementally deployable on today’s cellular networks.
The main focus is to offer privacy against global-bulk surveil-
lance of mobility and location, a practice by carriers that
is widespread and pernicious. We thwart this via eliminat-
ing the SUPI as an individual identiﬁer and decoupling the
authentication and connectivity mechanisms in the cellular
architecture.
Isn’t 5G more secure than legacy generations? The 5G
standard includes enhancements focused on user privacy and
system performance over legacy cellular generations. How-
ever, the enhancements do not offer location privacy beneﬁts
from the carriers.
Encrypted SUPIs. 5G includes the addition of encrypted
SUPIs, where public key cryptography, along with ephemeral
keys generated on the SIM, is used to encrypt the SUPI when
sending it to the network in the form of a Subscription Con-
cealed Identiﬁer (SUCI). This protects user SUPIs from eaves-
droppers. SUCI usage negates the effectiveness of local at-
tacks such as IMSI catchers. Thus, our techniques to increase
location privacy from local attackers (Section 4.2) will be-
come less necessary once a full transition to 5G is complete3.
However, SUCIs do not prevent the cellular provider itself
from knowing the user’s identity. An analogy for encrypted
SUPIs can be found in DNS over HTTPS (DoH): eavesdrop-
pers cannot see unencrypted trafﬁc, yet the endpoints (the
DNS resolver for DoH, the cellular core in 5G) still can. The
goal of this work is to not only thwart local-bulk attacks, but
also protect user privacy from mobile operators that would
otherwise violate it (i.e., global-bulk attacks).
Small cell location privacy. The 5G standard strives for
reduced latencies as well as much higher data throughputs.
This necessitates the use of cells that cover smaller areas in
higher frequency spectrum in order to overcome interference
compared with previous cellular generations that used macro-
cells to provide coverage to large areas. A (likely unintended)
byproduct of 5G’s use of smaller cells is a dramatic reduction
in location privacy for users. As the 5G network provider
maintains state pertaining to the location in the network for
a given user for the purposes of paging, smaller cells result
in the operator, or attacker, knowing user locations at a much
higher precision compared with previous generations.
What about active | trafﬁc analysis | signaling attacks?
While active, targeted attacks aren’t our main focus, we im-
prove privacy in the face of them by leveraging TALs to in-
crease and randomize the broadcast domain for paging trafﬁc,
making it more difﬁcult for attackers to know where a victim
is located (analyzed in Section 5.2). Further, the goal of many
active attacks is to learn users’ SUPIs, and our nulliﬁcation
of SUPIs renders such attacks meaningless.
An attacker with a tap at the network edge could use trafﬁc
analysis attacks to reduce user privacy. We largely view this
as out of scope as users can tunnel trafﬁc and use other means
to hide their data usage patterns.
Cellular networks rely on signaling protocols such as Sig-
naling System 7 (SS7) and Diameter when managing mobility
3Unfortunately, we do not anticipate a complete transition to 5G in the
near future. For example, AT&T is scheduled to phase out their 3G network in
the U.S. in 2022 (https://www.att.com/support/article/wireless/
KM1324171/).

as well as voice and SMS setup and teardown. These protocols
enable interoperability between carriers needed for roaming
and connectivity across carriers. Unfortunately, these proto-
cols were designed with inherent trust in the network players,
and have thus been used to reduce user privacy and disrupt
connectivity [24, 43, 51, 55, 67]. We design PGPP for 4G/5G
data only, which renders legacy SS7 compatibility moot. Our
PGPP design expects users to use outside messaging services
rather than an in-NGC IMS system.
Can PGPP support roaming? Yes. While we envision
that many PGPP users would explicitly not wish to roam, as
roaming partners may not provide privacy guarantees, roam-
ing is possible using a Diameter edge agent that only allows
for home routed roaming, forcing trafﬁc to route from the
visited network’s SMF back to the PGPP operator’s UPF,
rather than local breakout due to our authentication mecha-
nism (Section 4.1). Roaming, and international roaming in
particular, adds billing complexities for the PGPP operator.
Typically, the visited network collects call data records for
each roaming user on its network and calculates the wholesale
charges payable by the home network. The visited network
then sends a Transferred Account Procedure (TAP) ﬁle to the
home network via a data clearing house. The home network
then pays the visited network. In PGPP, the individual identity
of the user that roamed is not known, yet the PGPP operator
remains able to pay the appropriate fees to visited networks.
How does PGPP protect user privacy for voice or text
service? Out of the box, PGPP doesn’t provide protection for
such service. Instead, PGPP aims provide privacy from the
cellular architecture itself, and in doing so users are free to
use a third party VoIP provider (in which case the phone will
operate identically to a normal phone for telephony service
from a user’s perspective) or use recent systems by Lazar et
al. [46, 47] that provide strong metadata privacy guarantees
for communications, or similar systems such as [16,17,48,73].
We view PGPP as complementary to such systems.
How does PGPP protect users against leaky apps? PGPP
doesn’t, as it is about providing protection in the cellular
infrastructure. Even without leaky apps, users can always in-
tentionally or inadvertently reveal their identity and location.
Leaky apps make this worse as they collect and, sometimes, di-
vulge sensitive user information. We see PGPP as complemen-
tary to work that has targeted privacy in mobile app ecosys-
tems. Further, apps are not as fundamental as connectivity—
users can choose whether to install and run a leaky app, and
can constrain app permissions. However, phones are, by their
nature, always connected to carrier networks, and those very
networks have been selling user data to third parties.
If users can’t be identiﬁed by carriers, how can carriers
still make money? We introduce PGPP tokens in Section 4.1
as a mechanism for a PGPP operator to charge customers
while protecting user anonymity.
Can’t phone hardware be tracked as well? Phones have an
International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI). The IMEI
is assigned to the hardware by the manufacturer and identiﬁes
the manufacturer, model, and serial number of a given device.
Some operators keep an IMEI database to check whether a
device has been reported as stolen, known as an equipment
identity register (EIR); IMEIs in the database are blacklisted.
Such databases are optional.
For many devices, the IMEI can be changed through soft-
ware, often without root access. We envision a PGPP MVNO
would allow for subscribers to present their unchanged de-
vice IMEI, giving the PGPP operator the opportunity to check
