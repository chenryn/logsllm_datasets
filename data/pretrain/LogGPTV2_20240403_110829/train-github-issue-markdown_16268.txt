Challenge generate-random-whole-numbers-within-a-range has an issue.

I and several others in the JavaScript chat page are running into an issue
with this challenge; the code you can see below won't make the tests pass even
though it's logically sound and seems like the obvious answer. The tests that
aren't passing for me are the top two:
The lowest random number that can be generated by randomRange should be equal
to your minimum number, myMin.
The highest random number that can be generated by randomRange should be equal
to your maximum number, myMax.
        \ file: 
    // Example
    function ourRandomRange(ourMin, ourMax) {
      return Math.floor(Math.random() * (ourMax - ourMin + 1)) + ourMin;
    }
    ourRandomRange(1, 9);
    // Only change code below this line.
    function randomRange(myMin, myMax) {
      return Math.floor(Math.random() * (myMax - myMin + 1)) + myMin; // Change this line
    }
    // Change these values to test your function
    var myRandom = randomRange(5, 15);
