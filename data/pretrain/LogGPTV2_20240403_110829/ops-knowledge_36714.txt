User: I have several python.exe processes running on my Vista machine and I would like to kill one process thanks to the Windows task manager.
What is the best way to find which process to be killed. I've added the 'command line' column on task manager. It can help but not in all cases.
is there a better way?
Assistant: When I right clicked python in task manager and clicked open file location (win 10) it opened the plex installation folder so for me it is Plex that uses Python.exe to slow my computer down, shame as I use plex all the time for my Roku. Just have to put up with a slow computer and get another one.
