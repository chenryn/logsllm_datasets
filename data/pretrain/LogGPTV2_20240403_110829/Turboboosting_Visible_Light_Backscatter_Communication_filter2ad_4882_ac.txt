Solving the Optimization Problem. So far we formulate the
demodulation problem to an optimization problem for multistage
decision processes. This problem can be solved using Dynamic
Programming. The symbol sequence can be constructed through
the process of dynamic programming.
While implementing the dynamic programming algorithm, an
optimization is used to speed up the calculation: Instead of running
the algorithm after all symbols are sampled, we solve a subproblem
as soon as the required sample values for that subproblem are
sampled. As measured in §5.3.2, the time required to solve all the
subproblems related to a symbol is less than the time of a symbol,
resulting in an almost real-time demodulation.
5 EVALUATION
In this section, we present the experimental results from our pro-
totyped PassiveVLC– a 3 W modified flashlight as ViReader and a
battery-free ViTag. Here are the highlighted results:
• Link performance: ViTag operates at up to 1 kbps on a loss-
free uplink when it is within 1 m from ViReader. PassiveVLC
works for a flexible range of ViTag orientations up to ±60° and
under different ambient light condition (from dark chamber,
outdoor night, indoor office to day light).
• Energy Consumption: PassiveVLC adapts to different data
rate (0.25, 0.5 and 1 kbps) under a 150 µW power budget and
achieves sub-µ J per bit.
5.1 Prototype Implementation
We implemented PassiveVLC system shown in Fig. 1. The ViTag
is battery-free – it harvests light energy from the on-board solar
panel. The size of ViTag is 8.2 × 5.2 cm, same as a credit card. About
two-thirds area is used for solar cells and the rest for the LCD and
retroreflector. The ViReader is modified from a flashlight which
uses a 3 W white LED as the transmitter. Three photodetectors are
used in serial to improve the SNR. The overall cost of each ViTag is
about $8 and even less when in mass production.
5.2 Experimental Setup
We evaluate PassiveVLC using our prototype implementation with
a testbed shown in Fig. 16. We carried most of the experiments in
typical office environments, where the ambient light is maintained
in a comfortable range around 200 lx. As ViReader is externally
powered and the downlink signals are strong1, we have thus focused
on measuring the bottleneck uplink performance. We mount our
system on a robot and programmably control the movement of
our ViTag or ViReader to the desired position and orientation. The
system parameters include distance (between ViTag and ViReader),
incidence angle (ViTag), irradiation angle (ViReader), data rate
(uplink), packet length (uplink) and FoV (reader). The default setting
is summarized in Tab. 1. For each parameter setting, the ViTag
continuously sends 100 packets (4-byte ID data for each) to ViReader
with a constant rate and we take the average to report our results.
5.3 Micro-benchmarks
5.3.1 How reliable is the retroreflecting link? We use the packet
loss rate (PLR) as the primary metric to answer this question. For
VLC, the received signal strength is mainly affected by two fac-
tors,i.e. the distance between ViTag and ViReader and the incidence
angle [29]. In addition, we would also like to see whether the packet
length or ambient light condition will affect the link reliability.
Distance. We first measure the impact of distance on PLR by vary-
ing the Line-of-Sight (LoS) distance between ViReader and ViTag.
We count the number of packets correctly received at ViReader un-
der different data rate. From Fig. 11(a), we make two observations:
First, when ViTag is sending bits faster, it also has a higher PLR. This
is because when the LCD is not fully “open” or “close”, the resulting
low on/off ratio effect will decrease the signal strength. Second,
under a fixed bit rate, ViTag maintains a fairly stable loss-free up-
link until reaching a certain distance. This is because a lowest SNR,
which is often called as sensitivity, is needed for ViReader-Rx to

demodulate the backscattered signal. And with longer distance, the
backscattered signal will suffer from a higher channel loss, which
will be discussed further in §6.
Incidence Angle. We then evaluate the PLR under different in-
cidence angles corresponding to the orientation of ViTag. In this
experiment, we fixed the distance between ViReader and the ViTag
at 1 m, and varied the orientation of the ViTag. The purpose of this
experiment is to evaluate how flexible ViTag’s orientation can be
while maintaining a reliable link. Fig. 11(b) shows that when ViTag
maintains a loss-free uplink when its incidence angle is between
-60°and 60°. Thanks to the high coefficient of retroreflection on our
retroreflector, it is able to concentrate the reflected light automati-
cally and thus has a high gain in a wide range of orientations. Once
the harvested energy is below the sensitivity level (± 65°or so in
our case), the PLR drops to 100% in a sharp manner.
Packet Length. Packet length is another variable of interests
regarding to PLR as it represents the needs of different IoT appli-
cations, such as identification, sensor data, etc.. In Fig. 11(c), we
observe that a longer packet results in higher PLR in general. How-
ever, when ViTag is close to ViReader (< 2.7 m, typical distance
between illuminating infrastructure and IoT devices in indoor envi-
ronments), the PLR difference is marginal (< 5%). This is a desirable
outcome because it illustrates that despite a long packet increases
the bit error rate in theory, the length does not play a key role in
increasing PLR when the link is relatively short, as in most cases.
Environmental Impact. So far in our experiments, the ambient
lighting conditions are limited to office environments. In typical
VLC systems, ambient light only plays a “negative” role – a strong
lighting source can easily saturate the light sensor and make the
receiver fail. Interestingly, there is such a trade-off in PassiveVLC
system: on the one hand, the ambient light introduces the same
challenge to the optical receiver side; on the other hand, a higher
energy harvesting efficiency can potentially reduce the ViTag size
or increase the communication range. We measure the PLR under
different ambient light conditions. As shown in Fig. 11(d), we obtain
the best results (in terms of the lowest PLR under same distance)
in outdoor daytime and the worst in a dark chamber, as expected.
Interestingly, we observe that the results from outdoor night out-
perform the ones from office environments. This is because we
often have more lighting infrastructure in the vicinity which can
bring unexpected noise. Overall, we demonstrate that PassiveVLC
performs almost equally well under a variety of ambient lighting
conditions. Note that PassiveVLC can’t work when either ViTag
or ViReader is under direct sunlight. However, this is a general
problem with VLC, not unique to our system.
5.3.2 Response Time. Response time is defined as the time from
the ViReader issuing a query to receiving a response from the
ViTag. Therefore, a series of components in the downlink and up-
link (encoding, prefix, preamble, bit stream, decoding) account for
the response time in order. We experimentally segment these mod-
ules, report the timing breakdown results in Fig. 12. Note that we
only show part of the components which are highly relevant to the
uplink design. The rest accounts for only 10% of the total response
time. In Fig. 12, we observe that the time spent on uplink bit stream
is linearly proportional to the bit rate and the packet length, which
is expected. Note that our current design has a relatively long con-
stant delay (63 ms) for uplink prefix. This is because the downlink
transmission causes a huge impulse in the on-board power supply
module and other signal lines. Within several stages of amplifica-
tion, the impulse will cause saturation in the last stage amplifier,
which means that the reader cannot process any signal during that

As a result, we add a fixed pattern of prefix before the uplink
payload. The prefix also serves as the timing initialization in the
decode process. We plan to improve our hardware design to reduce
its impact in the future. Finally, we acknowledge that the current
design of PassiveVLC is not very efficient in terms of response time
– the ViReader can only issue at most 10 queries per second at the
highest rate (1 kbps) we achieved. We have a dedicated discussion
on that in §8.
5.3.3 Working Range. Another important question to ask is:
how far the ViTag can be away from the ViReader while still main-
tain an acceptable data link. Here we define the working range as
the area within which the ViTag can harvest enough energy and
talk with the ViReader with a chance above 50%, i.e., PLR is less
than 50%, and measure the working range in office environments.
Specifically, in this experiment we also adjust the FoV of the flash-
light to its maximum (35°) therefore it is expected to work in a wider
but shorter range. The working range in Fig. 13 is the area within
the closed curve. First, we observe that a lower data rate link leads
to a larger working distance in terms of both depth and breadth,
and the reason is similar as discussed in §5.3.1. With an upright
orientation of the ViTag, the maximum working distance is up to
3.3 m. Second, the angle of the working range is roughly equal to
the FoV of the lighting source. This is to be expected and in fact is
a favorable feature because based on it we can predict and control
the “width” of the working range. We note that PassiveVLC’s work-
ing range can be further extended with more energy harvested. A
emulation-based analysis is provided in §6.
5.4 Energy Consumption
Measuring the energy consumption is always critical for under-
standing the design trade-off (data rate, form factor, etc. in our
study) and finding optimization opportunities. In this experiment,
we disconnect the solar panel from our tag and use Monsoon [5] to
measure its power consumption. We power ViTag at 2 V because
it’s the minimum and safe operating voltage for the on-board MCU
to work. We operate the PassiveVLC as usual and shows the time-
series power consumption snapshot on the ViTag in Fig. 14. We
can see that in each query, ViTag spends 23 ms in listening, which
accounts for 678 µW and 15.6 µ J in total. This part of the energy is
mostly spent on the static current of the analog circuit for signal
detection. In other words, the receiving circuit is always on because
ViTag never knows when it is expecting an incoming signal. We
can address this deficiency with an efficient MAC protocol design.
Then the ViTag receives the downlink bit stream and encodes the
content to response, which consumes 373 µW . After that it turns
off the receiving circuit and starts to transmit. In the transmission
stage, ViTag spends less than 117 µW on average at the highest bit
rate, which is much lower than mW -level LED-based transmission.
We also see that ViTag spent more power in transmission but less
energy per bit when it operates at a higher bit rate.
Overall, we demonstrate that with such a low energy budget, we
are able to drive it by harvesting light energy using only small solar
cells (a more detailed analysis is provided in §5.5). We summarize the
break-down power/energy consumption for each query in Tab. 2.
