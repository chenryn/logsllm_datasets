User: How do I diagnose server performance issues? Please list common performance indicators and their meanings in order to optimize server performance.
Assistant: Common server performance indicators include: 1. CPU utilization: Indicates the percentage of CPU usage in the system. High CPU utilization means that the system is processing a large number of requests and may require increasing CPU cores or optimizing the application design. 2. Memory Utilization: Indicates the percentage of memory used in the system. High memory utilization can cause the application to crash or slow down, which can be optimized by increasing the memory capacity or reducing memory leaks in the application. 3. Hard Disk Utilization: Indicates the percentage of the system's disk in use. High disk utilization may indicate the need to increase disk capacity or optimize disk read and write operations for applications. 4. Network throughput: Indicates the speed at which the server sends and receives data. Low network throughput can be due to insufficient network bandwidth or poor application performance. 5. Number of threads: Indicates the current number of active threads, too many threads will slow down the system performance. You can optimize the thread pool settings to reduce the number of threads. 6. HTTP request response time: Indicates the response time from the request to the server. If the response time is very long, you need to optimize the server configuration or upgrade the hardware device. 7. The number of abnormal requests: indicates the number of request failures in the current system. A high number of abnormal requests means that errors in the system need to be eliminated and code optimization should be performed. In general, to optimize server performance, it is necessary to analyze from multiple directions, find the bottleneck, and then optimize it in a targeted manner. Paying attention to performance indicators and troubleshooting problems in a timely manner is crucial to improving system performance.
