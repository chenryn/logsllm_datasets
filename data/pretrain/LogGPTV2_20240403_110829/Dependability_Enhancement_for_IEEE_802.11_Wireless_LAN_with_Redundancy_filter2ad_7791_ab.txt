of operation. An RR may also be sent in what is called
the controlled contention interval (CCI), where contention
occurs only among QoS stations that wish to request new
TXOPs. During a TXOP in EPCF mode, the polled station
may initiate multiple frame exchange sequences. This gives
the EPCF the ﬂexibility to support bursty QoS trafﬁc.
3 DS conﬁguration of the redundant AP
scheme
An additional access point is placed in the shadow area
with the same frequency as the primary AP. The secondary
AP forwards the data from the mobile stations in the shadow
area to the primary AP, and also forwards the data from
the primary AP to the mobile stations in the shadow area.
In the DS conﬁguration, the secondary AP is connected to
the same distribution system as the primary AP. In other
words, the two access points communicate over the distri-
bution system. This scheme is illustrated in Figure 3.
The implementation issues of this conﬁguration mainly
involve two aspects: Firstly, upon entering the shadow re-
gion, a mobile station will detect the link failure with the
primary AP by not receiving the beacon signal from the pri-
mary AP. Since the beacon interval is less than 100ms, the
maximum detection delay for link failures is 100ms. After
detection, it needs to switch its communication to the sec-
ondary AP in a timely manner.
Secondly, since the mobile station in the shadow area
cannot hear the ongoing channel activities in the open area,
it would always sense the channel in idle state and start
transmission without deferring. This causes packet colli-
sions at the mobile stations which can hear both the shadow
area and the open area [6] [7]. Therefore, the mobile sta-
tions in the shadow area should use some form of PCF
mode, rather than the DCF mode, to access the channel. For

this reason, the controlled contention based schemes pro-
posed as part of 802.11e effort are adopted for governing
the channel access where a mobile station in the shadow
region may only transmit data when it is granted a trans-
mission opportunity by the secondary AP.
Since both AP’s are connected to the same distribution
system, and their wireless link may be blocked by obstacles
in the wireless network, it can be reasonably assumed that
the primary AP and the secondary AP communicate with
each other via the wired link. To grant channel access, the
primary AP sends the speciﬁcation of transmission oppor-
tunity to the secondary AP. Simultaneously, the primary AP
also broadcasts the same channel reservation message in the
cell in the form of a QoS-Poll frame. In this way, all stations
in the non-shadowed area will receive the QoS-Poll frame
and defer any transmission attempt until the channel reser-
vation time is over. With channel reserved, the secondary
AP then sends the QoS-Poll frame to mobile stations in the
shadow region sequentially so that they may send their data
packets free of collisions. By this scheme, the potential col-
lisions are eliminated since the channel is always reserved
when the mobile stations in the shadow region transmit.
Figure 4 shows the packet transfer for this scheme, where
SIFS, PIFS and DIFS are speciﬁc time intervals in IEEE
802.11 protocol to grant priority to different packet types.
4 The forwarding conﬁguration of the redun-
dant AP scheme
In this conﬁguration, the secondary AP is placed at a
certain location where it could communicate with both the
mobile terminal in the shadow area and with the primary
AP. This access point thus could forward the packet trans-
missions in both directions. Compared with the DS con-
ﬁguration, where the secondary AP needs to be placed at
a ﬁxed location to be connected to the wired network, the
secondary AP in the forwarding conﬁguration may be mo-
bile and could provide higher ﬂexibility.
If shadow area
changes due to variations in wireless environment, the sec-
ondary AP may be re-allocated to provide better coverage.
However, since both uplink and downlink data associated

with the mobile stations in the shadow area need to be trans-
mitted twice on the wireless links, the end to end delay is
longer and the channel utilization is lower. Moreover, such
mobile secondary APs are more prone to power failures due
to limited battery life.
Similar to the DS conﬁguration, when a mobile station
enters the shadow area, it will discover the link failure with
the primary AP after a delay of less than 100ms. Upon de-
tection of the link failure, the mobile terminal needs to as-
sociate with the secondary AP in the region and direct its
uplink trafﬁc to primary AP through the secondary.
For the same reasons as mentioned in the discussions in
Section 3, the channel access for this conﬁguration should
also be based on the controlled contentions. To grant the
channel access to the secondary AP, the primary AP sends a
TXOP (QoS-Poll frame) on the wireless link. Since all sta-
tions in the open area receive the QoS-Poll frame,they will
defer any tranmission attempt until the end of the channel
reservation period, The secondary AP then initiates frame
transfers with the mobile stations in the shadow area se-
quentially until the end of the reservation period indicated
by the TXOP. The data packets from these mobile stations
will be buffered at the secondary AP and will be forwarded
to the primary AP at a subsequent TXOP.
5 Dependability evaluation
In this section, we brieﬂy discuss the dependability is-
sues for the WLAN. Quantitative measures of interest in-
clude reliability, availability and survivability for each end
to end connection, and we point out the approaches to ob-
tain these measures.
Physical faults of the end to end communication connec-
tion in the WLAN with redundant APs include [4]:
• Node faults: Node faults are caused by either hardware
or software faults in a node. Typical node faults in an
AP may be introduced by a strong interference source
(e.g., a microwave oven) placed near the AP and result
in the incapability of the AP to receive data from other
nodes. Node faults in secondary APs in the Forward-
ing conﬁguration may be the result of power failure
due to the AP’s limited battery life.
• Link faults: Link faults are introduced by a mobile ter-
minal entering a shadow area. When this happens, the
communication between the mobile node and the AP
is lost and the service is interrupted.
In this paper we make the following assumptions in the
dependability models:
• All component failure events are mutually indepen-
dent;
• The failure and repair time are exponentially dis-
tributed; and
• The switching delay is small compared to the time to
failures, so that during the switching delay no addi-
tional failure event occur.
are listed as in Table 1.

primary AP failure and j = 2 represents secondary AP fail-
ure in either conﬁguration. The tuple {(i, j), i ∈ I, j ∈ J}
deﬁnes a state where the system is in open (or shadow) re-
gions, with (or without) primary AP failures and with (or
without) secondary AP failures.
5.2 Reliability
With AP failures, mobile stations cannot be connected
to the wired network and thus the system fails. Therefore,
for systems with no redundancy mechanisms, a communi-
cation link fails either when the primary AP fails or when
the mobile node enters a shadow region. The reliability is
thus
Rs(t) = e−(λpf +λos)t
For the DS and forwarding conﬁguration, the reliability
is
Rra(t) = e−(λpf +λrf )t,
which means that the connection fails only if either the pri-
mary or the secondary AP fails.
5.3 Availability
The availability model for systems with no redundancy
schemes is shown in Figure 6. When redundant AP are not
available, the link fails and the connection becomes unavail-
able when the node moves into the shadow region, and the
service is thus unavailable in states (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1).
For a system with a redundant AP( either conﬁguration),
the connection to the primary AP is switched to the sec-
ondary AP upon the node entering the shadow region, af-
ter a detection and switch delay with mean 1/λd. There-
fore, these conﬁgurations have higher availability than the
scheme with no redundancy. This is illustrated in Figure 7.
A system that is available in open area (state (0, 0)) may en-
ter the shadow region with transition from (0, 0) to (1, 0).
After a detection delay, the system becomes available again
by entering state (2, 0). Since the detection delay is smaller
than the component failure time by several orders of magni-
tude, here we neglect the failure events while the system is
in state (1, 0), and only consider the failure events in states
(0, 0) and (2, 0).
In the DS conﬁguration, when the node is in open area,
the failure of secondary AP will not affect the communi-
cation link availability. Therefore, the connection is avail-
able in states (0, 0) and (0, 2). On the other hand, when the
node is in the shadow area, the failure of primary AP will
not affect the communication link availability (since the re-
dundant AP may also act as primary AP in case of primary
AP failures), and thus connection availability is preserved
in states (2, 0) and (2, 1).

Figure 7. Availability model for system with
redundant AP (both conﬁgurations)
Compared with the DS Conﬁguration, the secondary AP
in the Forwarding conﬁguration can not assume the role of
the primary when the primary AP fails. Therefore, the con-
nection will be available only in state (2, 0) while the node
is in the shadow area. When the node is in open area, the
states with connectivity are (0, 0) and (0, 2), same as the
“DS Conﬁguration”.
