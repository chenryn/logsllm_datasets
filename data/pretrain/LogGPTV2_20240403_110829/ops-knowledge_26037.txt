User: What would be the best practice in this scenario?
I have an App Engine Python app, with multiple cron jobs. Instantiated by user requests and cron jobs, push notifications might be sent. This could easily scale up to a total of +- 100 pushes per minute.
Setting up and tearing down a connection to APNs for every batch is not what I want. Neither is Apple advising to do this. So I would like to keep the connection alive, even when user requests finish or when a cron finishes. Possibly with a timeout (2 minutes no pushes, then close then connection).
Reading the GAE documentation, I couldn't figure out if there even is such a thing available. Also, I might need this to be available in different apps and/or modules.
Assistant: You can use the datastore (eventually shadowed by memcache for performance) to persist all the necessary APN (or any other) connection/protocol status/context info such that multiple related requests can share the same connection as if your app would be a long-living one.
Maybe not trivial, but definitely feasible.
Some requests may need to be postponed temporarily, depending on the shared connection status/context, that's true.
