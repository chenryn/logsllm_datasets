User: How to deploy Node.js applications under Linux?
Assistant: 1. Install Node.js: Download the corresponding version of Node.js installation package from the official website, and then install it. 2. Write Node.js application: Use an editor or development environment to write Node.js application code and make sure it can run in the local environment. 3. Install the required dependencies: Use the npm command to install the dependent libraries required by the application. In the application root directory, run the npm install command. 4. Set environment variables: In the Linux system, some environment variables need to be set so that the application can run correctly in different environments. You can set environment variables in the bashrc file, for example, set NODE_ENV to production. 5. Deploy the application: Upload the application code to the server and start the application on the server. Applications can be started and monitored using a process manager such as pm2. 6. Configure reverse proxy: Use reverse proxy tools such as Nginx to forward requests to Node.js applications. 7. Configure the SSL certificate: In order to protect the security of user data, it is recommended to enable the https protocol in the application and install the SSL certificate. In short, to deploy Node.js applications under Linux, you need to be familiar with the basic commands and environment of the Linux system, the use of Node.js and npm, and the configuration of reverse proxy and SSL certificates.
