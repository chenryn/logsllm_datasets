ABSTRACT
For secure data sharing in the public cloud, attribute-based encryption was introduced to simultaneously achieve data
conﬁdentiality and ﬁne-grained access control. In order to update access control of the attribute-based encrypted data from
delegation, attribute-based proxy re-encryption (AB-PRE) was proposed accordingly. Most previous AB-PRE schemes
require that the proxy executes the re-encryption honestly. However, the public cloud as a proxy may not meet the
requirement because the encrypted data are delegated to the public cloud and out of control for data owners. In this paper,
we introduce veriﬁability for AB-PRE to check the correctness of the re-encryption executed by the proxy. By introducing
a commitment scheme and a key derivation function, we propose a generic construction of unidirectional single-hop
AB-PRE with veriﬁable re-encryption (AB-VPRE) for both key-policy and ciphertext-policy settings, and the access
structure can be monotonic and non-monotonic. We prove the security and the veriﬁcation soundness of our constructed
AB-VPRE scheme in the standard model and provide three instantiations. Compared with previous work on AB-PRE, our
proposed AB-VPRE schemes require less computation and can efﬁciently detect the malicious behaviors of the proxy.

1. INTRODUCTION
With the rapid development of cloud applications, more
and more users require data storage and computation
services in the public cloud. Data owners outsource
their data to the public cloud for sharing with others,
and security of the data sharing is a problem of extreme
concern. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) [1] was then
introduced to achieve data privacy and ﬁne-grained access
control simultaneously.
If the attribute-based encrypted data in the public cloud
is in urgent need while all the qualiﬁed users are unavail-
able, proxy re-encryption is a good help to re-encrypt the
data from delegation without revealing any conﬁdential
information. Traditional proxy re-encryption in the public
key cryptosystem allows a proxy to translate one ciphertext
into another with a different public key. Employing proxy
re-encryption into attribute-based cryptosystem, Liang
et al. [2] proposed attribute-based proxy re-encryption
(AB-PRE). According to which ciphertexts or private keys
that access policies are associated with, AB-PRE is divided
into ciphertext-policy (CP) AB-PRE and key-policy (KP)
AB-PRE. CP (or KP) AB-PRE delegates a third party to
translate the data encrypted under one access policy (or
set of attributes) to another one such that access control
of the encrypted data will be changed. Hence, AB-PRE
is a promising technique to achieve access control update
from delegation. Speciﬁcally, qualiﬁed users can delegate
the public cloud to re-encrypt the ciphertext under the
guarantee of the security of private information.
An application of CP-AB-PRE is the electronic med-
ical record system where patients’ medical records are
encrypted associated with access policies (e.g., “Ortho-
pedics” AND “Director” AND “Union Hospital”) before
outsourcing to the cloud. Doctors obtain private keys
according to their attributes (e.g., “Department” and
“Title”). If a patient is in an emergency and no qualiﬁed
doctors are available, CP-AB-PRE is needed to translate
the encrypted records into that under another access policy
such that the records can be obtained in time.

An application of KP-AB-PRE is secure forensic
analysis for the audit log that includes detailed accounts
of activities on the system or network to be protected [3].
If a company intends to upload some audit log entries
to the cloud for forensic analysis without leaking secret
information, it could encrypt these entries with anno-
tated attributes (e.g., “User Name”, “Date”, and “Action”).
A forensic analyst would be issued a secret key associ-
ated with an access policy (e.g., “User Name: Alice” OR
(“Date: Between 2012-1-1 and 2014-1-1” AND “Action:
Access the data pertained to designing the new prod-
uct”)). If the speciﬁed forensic analyst is absent, he or
she can delegate the public cloud to update access con-
trol by applying KP-AB-PRE such that the work will not
be delayed.
The existing AB-PRE schemes (e.g., [2,4–6]) always
assume that the proxy is semi-trusted and executes the
re-encryption honestly; however, the public cloud as a
proxy is not necessarily honest and may perform unreliable
computation due to malfunction, malicious attack, and
so on. Previous work on AB-PRE mainly focuses on
data privacy and access control rather than taking the
re-encryption veriﬁcation into consideration together. Data
privacy and access control guarantee that any adversary
is not able to learn any conﬁdential information about
the plaintext and the private key, but lack of checking on
the correctness of the re-encryption could make the user
receive incorrect results from the proxy. Recall the appli-
cation scenarios described before. Incorrect information
about the medical records could cause a serious medi-
cal accident, and invalid results analyzed from incorrectly
re-encrypted entries may lead to signiﬁcant economic
losses for the company.
Therefore, how to guarantee the correctness of the
re-encrypted ciphertexts and detect
the re-encryption
performed by the proxy for AB-PRE is worthy of attention.
In this paper, we investigate the network model and pro-
pose a novel technique to solve this issue.
1.1. Our techniques
By combining a commitment scheme and a key derivation
function during the encryption, we provide the veriﬁ-
cation mechanism for the re-encryption executed by an
untrusted proxy. Our veriﬁcation mechanism is divided
into two steps: invariant test and correct detection. Invari-
ant test checks for the invariant components of the original
ciphertext during the re-encryption. Correct detection that
occurs during the decryption helps a user to examine the
calculation correctness of the re-encrypted ciphertexts.
As the network model shown in Figure 1, the encrypted
data are stored in the public cloud server denoting cloud
storage service providers (CSS) for data sharing and the
re-encryption is executed by the public cloud server denot-
ing re-encryption cloud service providers (RCS). We note
that CSS is assumed to be semi-trusted and to honestly per-
form the invariant test. If a user requires updating access
control of the data, it submits the re-encryption key (re-
key) to RCS and CSS sends the original ciphertext to
RCS. Next, the re-encrypted ciphertext is returned to CSS
and experience the invariant test. If the invariant test fails,
an error symbol will be given for storage. Otherwise, the
re-encrypted ciphertext will be stored instead. When the
qualiﬁed users decrypt the re-encrypted ciphertext, the
commitment as a component of the ciphertext can be used
to verify the re-encryption.
1.2. Our contributions
For AB-PRE applied to update access control of the
encrypted data with an untrusted proxy (e.g., the pub-
lic cloud), the correctness of the re-encrypted ciphertexts
returned from the proxy requires to be checked. We

propose a technique to introduce veriﬁability for AB-PRE
to detect the re-encryption executed by the proxy and
provide a generic construction of unidirectional single-hop
AB-PRE with veriﬁable re-encryption (AB-VPRE).
We present the model of AB-VPRE and describe deﬁ-
nitions for data privacy, the veriﬁcation soundness, and the
weak master key security. The veriﬁcation algorithms are
introduced according to the two steps of invariant test and
correct detection. Only if the veriﬁcation is passed can the
decryption algorithm be performed successfully to recover
the data. We prove that our constructed AB-VPRE scheme
is secure against chosen plaintext attack (CPA secure) and
meets the veriﬁcation soundness in the standard model.
Finally, we instantiate our construction with three
AB-KEMs in KP and CP settings, supporting linear-secret-
sharing-realizable and non-monotonic access structures.
The resulting AB-VPRE schemes inherit the security prop-
erty of the underlying AB-KEMs and have the weak mas-
ter key security under the computational Difﬁe–Hellman
(CDH) assumption. Compared with previous AB-PRE
schemes, our instantiations of AB-VPRE schemes are
relatively more efﬁcient, and the re-encryption executed by
an untrusted proxy can be veriﬁed.
1.3. Related work
After the concept of ABE [1] was introduced, KP-
ABE and CP-ABE schemes [3,7–9] with monotonic and
non-monotonic access structures were developed, respec-
tively. For reducing the decryption overhead for resource-
constrained users, Green et al. [10] proposed outsourcing
the decryption of ABE. Then Lai et al. [11] presented an
ABE scheme with veriﬁable outsourced decryption.
Proxy re-encryption scheme was ﬁrst formalized by
Blaze, Bleumer, and Strauss [12], and the ﬁrst unidirec-
tional single-hop PRE scheme was proposed by Ateniese
et al. [13]. Although several PRE schemes were pre-
sented after that,
the ﬁrst generic construction of a
secure against chosen-ciphertext attacks (CCA-secure)
PRE scheme was proposed by Hanaoka et al. [14].
Recently, Ohata et al. [15] introduced re-encryption veri-
ﬁability to the PRE scheme to detect illegal activities of
the proxy and showed its CCA security. After the con-
cept of ABE emerged, Liang et al. [2] proposed the ﬁrst
CP-AB-PRE scheme based on the CP-ABE scheme [8]
supporting non-monotonic access structures. Then Luo
et al. [16] proposed another CP-AB-PRE scheme with
multi-value positive attributes. Apart from this, Yu et al.
proposed two AB-PRE schemes of KP [17] and CP [18],
respectively. Seo et al. [19] presented a CP-AB-PRE
scheme with constant paring operation latency. Liang et al.
constructed CCA-secure CP-AB-PRE schemes [4–6] and
some other models based on AB-PRE [20].

AB-VPRE scheme is deﬁned by the following polynomial-
time algorithms:
(cid:4) Setup(1(cid:2), U): The setup algorithm takes as input
the security parameter (cid:2) and the attribute universe U
and then outputs the public parameters PP and the
master secret key MSK.
(cid:4) KGen(PP, MSK, Ikey): The key generation algo-
rithm takes as input PP, MSK, and Ikey and then
outputs a private key SKI.
(cid:4) Enc(PP, Ienc, M): The encryption algorithm takes
as input PP, Ienc, and a message M and then outputs
a ciphertext CTI.
(cid:4) Dec(PP, SKI, CTI): The decryption algorithm at
original ciphertexts takes as input PP, SKI, and CTI
and then outputs M if f (Ikey, Ienc) = 1, and an error
symbol ?, otherwise.
(cid:4) RKGen(PP, SKI, I0
enc): The re-encryption key
generation algorithm takes as input PP, SKI, and I0
enc
and then outputs a re-encryption key RKI!I0 .
(cid:4) REnc(PP, RKI!I0 , CTI): The re-encryption algo-
rithm takes as input PP, RKI!I0 , and CTI and then
outputs a re-encrypted ciphertext CTI0 if f (Ikey, Ienc)
= 1, and an error symbol ?, otherwise.
(cid:4) REVer.Test(CTI, CTI0): The re-encryption test
algorithm takes as input CTI and CTI0 and then
outputs a bit b.
(cid:4) REVer.Dec(PP, SKI0, CTI0, b): The re-encryption
veriﬁcation and decryption algorithm takes as input
PP, SKI0 , CTI0, and a bit b and then outputs M if b =
1, and an error symbol ?, otherwise.

Before providing the deﬁnitions of data privacy, the
weak master key security, and the veriﬁcation soundness
for AB-VPRE, we deﬁne the key generation oracle Osk,
the re-encryption key generation oracle Ork,
the re-
encryption oracle Ore, the decryption oracle Ode, and
the re-encryption veriﬁcation and decryption oracle Orvd,
respectively, as described in Table I.
CPA security at original ciphertexts. An AB-VPRE
scheme is CPA secure at original ciphertexts if for any
probabilistic polynomial-time (PPT) adversary A, assisted
by the oracle O 2 {Osk,Ork}, the advantage in the
