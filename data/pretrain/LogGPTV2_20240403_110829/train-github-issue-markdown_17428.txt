Chaining `ngFor` with a `slice` pipe throws errors.  
I just realized that now that the dev mode is enabled by default (alpha-55).
    @Component({
      selector: 'users-cmp',
      template: `{{user.name}}`
    })
    export class UsersCmp {
      users: Array = [
        {name: 'Cedric},
        {name: 'Agnes'},
        {name: 'Cyril'}
      ];
    }
Gives `Expression 'users | slice:0:2 in UsersCmp@0:5' has changed after it was
checked`.  
Runtime works (despite the errors), but unit tests are failing.
Related to #5941 I think.
