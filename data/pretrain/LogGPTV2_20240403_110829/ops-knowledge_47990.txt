I have a popular social game for which I was storing every user action as an Event entity in the data store. These events were then exported from Google App Engine (GAE) once per day for processing. Now, I need to delete all 300 million of these entities from the data store.

Initially, I started using the "Datastore Admin" tool for this task. In the first few hours, it managed to delete approximately 2 million entities, costing around $10 in CPU usage. At this rate, it would cost about $1,500 to complete the deletion. This has led me to consider deleting the entire application and copying over the items I want to keep to a new application. 

However, I received some advice on the #appengine IRC channel that suggests a potentially more cost-effective approach: retrieving the keys of 2,000 entities at a time and spawning tasks to delete them in smaller batches. The keys can be passed as strings to these tasks. I am currently testing this method and will provide an update tomorrow on whether it proves to be more economical.

### Questions:
- Are your Event entities grouped into entity groups?
- How many indexes do you have? Are any of them composite indexes?
- How many properties in your Event entities are not set to `indexed=False`?

Understanding these details will help in determining the overall cost and efficiency of the deletion process. Additionally, you may be able to vacuum some of your indexes before starting the deletion to reduce the overhead.
