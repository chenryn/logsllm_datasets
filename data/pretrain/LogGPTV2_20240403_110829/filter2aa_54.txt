Motivation  
Why we are interested in seismological networks? 
An average attacker  is not interested for this attacks  
Governments are interested.. you know.. …..!@#$%  WAR 
Cool and new attack scenario ¨extreme environment¨ 
You are playing with devices that measure natural disasters  
Could  lead to a financial sabotage  to a specific company/country  
The vendors of this instruments doesn’t have any sense of computer security 
Remote access, remote exploitation  
Ok let’s continue this project…  
How we discovered this devices?  
DEMO 
Fingerprints too many fingerprints  
For some strange reason you find a unique fingerprint in millions…

So.. WTF is TAURUS ???? Let´s connect to that shit NOW! 
Seismometers are instruments that measure motion of the 
ground, including those of seismic waves generated 
by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and other seismic 
sources. Records of seismic waves allow seismologists to 
map the interior of the Earth, and locate and measure the 
size of these different sources.

Impact 
-No one else has ever done a research about  security of this devices or networks 
before 
-Remote Denial of service  
-Remote management 
-Several Bugs 
-Sabotage  seismological country’s network  
-Economic impact for Oil and Gas research  for specific company 
-Drug trafficking  submarine detection 
-Military 
-Unknow 
This increased understanding can lead to improved oil and gas recovery.

Deployment options  
The Taurus may be deployed as either a stand-alone data recorder or as a network 
component. 
For stand-alone recording where network access is not required, typically you would 
configure the Taurus to run in Buffered mode. It consumes less power in this mode as 
the Controller only runs when the Taurus is recording buffered data to the Store.   
For networked operation you must configure the Taurus to run in Communications mode 
and configure the appropriate network options. In this mode, the Controller is running 
continuously. It consumes more power than Buffered mode but allows continuous 
access via an IP connection. 
You can stream time-series data from a Taurus to a central acquisition server, for 
example to write the data to NAQS ringbuffers. To stream Taurus data to NAQS, the 
NpToNmxp utility must be running on the NAQS server 
• Stream NP Packets – Set Taurus to stream data to the specified destination; enabled , 
not enabled . Factory default is not enabled. • IP Address – The address of the streaming 
destination (for example, a NAQS server); a valid IP address in dotted decimal format

Geophysicists depend on seismometers to 
monitor earthquakes generated by the motion 
of the tectonic plates that form the Earth’s 
crust. In order to function, the instruments 
need to be leveled prior to operation. That’s 
easy enough for a device deployed on dry land, 
but when it comes to seismometers placed on 
the ocean floor thousands of feet below the 
surface, the process gets a bit more 
challenging. To solve it, Nanometrics Inc. 
(Kanata, Ontario) combines sophisticated 
gimbals and microprocessors, along with ultra-
reliable, efficient motors from MICROMO 
(Clearwater, FL).

Challenge: In order to function, the 
instruments need to be leveled prior to 
operation. Not easy when it is thousands feet 
on the ocean floor. 
Solution: To solve it, Nanometrics Inc. (Kanata, 
Ontario) combines sophisticated gimbals and 
microprocessors, along with ultra-reliable, 
efficient motors from MICROMO (Clearwater, 
FL) 
Results: A Trillium 240 was deployed at the 
South Pole and it operated perfectly. The turn-
on temperature was -58°C (-136°F). The system 
temperature settled eventually to -50° C (-
122°F) and stayed there for a long period of 
time. The motors turned on and did exactly 
what they were supposed to do 
OCEAN BOTTOM DEPLOYMENT VIDEO DEMO 
To deploy the Trillium OBS (black cylinder), 
users attach the seismometer to a metal sled 
that carries it down to the sea floor. At the end 
of the experiment, the transponder signal 
triggers the release of ballast and the 
instrument floats to the surface. (Courtesy of 
Nanometrics Inc. 
Inside the Solution 
Seismometers capture transient phenomenon. If an instrument 
malfunctions, whether it’s at the bottom of 
the ocean or atop a polar ice cap, that data 
is lost forever. “You need to be absolutely sure the sensor will 
perform perfectly every time,” says Jeff Potter, director of marketing at 
Nanometrics. “Seismometers also need to be small and consume very little 
power when they level themselves, and that’s where MICROMO has helped.” 
The leveling mechanism integrates the following devices: 
The AM1020-V-6-65, a in a 10-mm-diameter, two- phase stepper motor that 
provides a peak torque of 1.6 mNm. With 20 steps per revolution, and 
PRECIstep technology, the motor offers reliable, accurate motion, even in harsh 
environments. 
A 10/1 planetary gearbox provides a 256:1 reduction ratio in a 10-mm-
diameter package. 
Vulnerability research 
-We want a shell in that thing  
-The firmware was not easy to find in the internet 
-This equipment is very  expensive  
-Not everyone can buy these things directly to the 
vendor, you need to be an organization/academics . 
-Let tell you the story about how i was be able to get the 
firmware …..  
FUCK YEAH!!!!!! 
WTF? 
BUSTED…but too late for them 
Too much talk!!

There is backdoor, factory user is not in official documentation. 
Test some vulnerabilities.. You know..  
PWD !! Shellshock  
Bugs and errors everywhere 
GURALP Systems  are easy to find looking in the SSL certificate metadata in NetDB 
Ok , now we are root  so .. What’s next ? 
PROTOCOL / COMMUNICATIONS 
The Standard for the Exchange of Earthquake 
Data (SEED) is a data format intended primarily 
for the archival and exchange of seismological 
time series data and related metadata. The 
format is maintained by the International 
Federation of Digital Seismograph Networks 
and documented in the SEED Manual (PDF 
format). Originally designed in the late 1980s, 
the format has been enhanced and refined a 
number of times and remains in widespread 
use. 
Data identification nomenclature  
The SEED format uses 4 name components to uniquely identify a time series and 
provide attribution to the owner of the data: 
Network code: a 1 or 2 character code identifying the network/owner of the data. 
These codes are assigned by the FDSN to provide uniqueness to seismological data, new 
codes may be requested. 
Station code: a 1 to 5 character identifier for the station recording the data. 
Location ID: a 2 character code used to uniquely identify different data streams at a 
single station. These IDs are commonly used to logically separate multiple instruments 
or sensor sets at a single station. 
Channel codes: a 3 character combination used to identify the 1) band and general 
sample rate 2) the instrument type and 3) the orientation of the sensor. A convention 
for these codes has been established and is documented in Appendix A of 
the SEED Manual. 
What if……

Conclusions 
-We are be able to locate this devices anywhere in the world 
-We are in control of the device , the network and  the 
software running on it. 
-There is no SSL in communications 
-This devices help engineers to save people and understand 
the earth  
-Vendors please… code better and think in security
