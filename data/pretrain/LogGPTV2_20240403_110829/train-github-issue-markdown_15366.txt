### Example Code
    from fastapi import FastAPI
    from pydantic import BaseModel
    app = FastAPI()
    class MyBaseModel(BaseModel):
        def __hash__(self):  # make hashable BaseModel subclass
            return hash((type(self),) + tuple(self.__dict__.values()))
    class NestedItems(MyBaseModel):
        name: str
    class Items(MyBaseModel):
        items: set[NestedItems]
    @app.post("/offers/")
    async def create_items(items: Items):
        return items
This can be tested with the following command:
    uvicorn mre:app --reload &
    curl -X 'POST' \
      'http://127.0.0.1:8000/offers/' \
      -H 'accept: application/json' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{
      "items": [
        {
              "name": "string"
        }
      ]
    }'
### Description
  * The following command triggers the error `TypeError: unhashable type: 'dict'`.
  * It works if I replace `NestedItems` by a simple `str`.
  * It works if I replace `set` by a simple `list`.
