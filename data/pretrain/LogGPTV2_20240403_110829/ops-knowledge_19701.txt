User: I would like to wipe out all data for a specific kind in Google App Engine. What is the
best way to do this?
I wrote a delete script (hack), but since there is so much data is
timeout's out after a few hundred records.
Assistant: You can use the task queues to delete chunks of say 100 objects.
Deleting objects in GAE shows how limited the Admin capabilities are in GAE. You have to work with batches on 1000 entities or less. You can use the bulkloader tool that works with csv's but the documentation does not cover java.
I am using GAE Java and my strategy for deletions involves having 2 servlets, one for doing the actually delete and another to load the task queues. When i want to do a delete, I run the queue loading servlet, it loads the queues and then GAE goes to work executing all the tasks in the queue.
How to do it:
Create a servlet that deletes a small number of objects.
Add the servlet to your task queues.
Go home or work on something else ;)
Check the datastore every so often ...
I have a datastore with about 5000 objects that i purge every week and it takes about 6 hours to clean out, so i run the task on Friday night.
I use the same technique to bulk load my data which happens to be about 5000 objects, with about a dozen properties.
