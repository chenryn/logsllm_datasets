## üêõ Bug
I met the following error when I was using pytorch 1.6 with LSTM  
RuntimeError: cuDNN error: CUDNN_STATUS_BAD_PARAM
## To Reproduce
I think the root cause was that I was using the mixed precision training mode
in pytorch 1.6 following
https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/amp_examples.html  
and the datatype might be converted to fp16 which causes this error.  
When I train my model with full precision, it worked normally.
