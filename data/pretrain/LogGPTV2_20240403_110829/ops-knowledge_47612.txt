It seems you are having trouble running Jupyter Notebook from the command line, as the system does not recognize `jupyter` as a valid command. However, you can run it through PyCharm, and by using the IP and port from the PyCharm kernel, you can access the notebook in your web browser. You mentioned that you cannot use Anaconda due to compatibility issues with ArcPy, and you have explored the Jupyter files for potential solutions.

### Steps to Resolve the Issue:

1. **Check Jupyter Installation:**
   Ensure that Jupyter is installed in your Python environment. You can check this by running:
   ```sh
   pip show jupyter
   ```
   If Jupyter is not installed, you can install it using:
   ```sh
   pip install jupyter
   ```

2. **Add Jupyter to System Path:**
   If Jupyter is installed but still not recognized, you may need to add the directory containing the Jupyter executable to your system's PATH environment variable.

   - **Locate Jupyter Executable:**
     Find the location of the `jupyter` executable. This is typically found in the `Scripts` folder within your Python installation directory. For example:
     ```sh
     C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\Scripts
     ```

   - **Add to PATH:**
     Add this directory to your system's PATH. Hereâ€™s how to do it on Windows:
     1. Open the Start Search, type in "env", and select "Edit the system environment variables".
     2. In the System Properties window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.
     3. In the Environment Variables window, find the `Path` variable in the "System variables" section and select it. Click "Edit".
     4. In the Edit Environment Variable window, click "New" and add the path to the `Scripts` directory.
     5. Click "OK" to close all windows and apply the changes.

3. **Verify the Change:**
   Open a new Command Prompt and type:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   If everything is set up correctly, Jupyter Notebook should start, and your default web browser should open to the Jupyter interface.

### Additional Notes:
- **Anaconda Command Prompt:**
  The suggestion to use the Anaconda Command Prompt to run `jupyter notebook` is not applicable in your case since you cannot use Anaconda due to ArcPy compatibility issues.

- **Alternative IDEs:**
  While PyCharm works, you might also consider other IDEs or tools like Visual Studio Code, which has excellent support for Jupyter Notebooks and Python development.

If you continue to experience issues, please provide more details about your Python environment and any error messages you encounter.
