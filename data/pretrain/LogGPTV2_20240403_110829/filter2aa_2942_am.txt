CONFIGURATION SETTINGS | RESPOND TO UNAUTHORIZED CHANGES 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The enterprise should ensure that designated security or IT 
personnel are alerted to unauthorized changes to configuration settings. When suppliers, developers, 
system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers are 
responsible for such unauthorized changes, this qualifies as a C-SCRM incident that should be 
recorded and tracked to monitor trends. For a more comprehensive view, a specific, predefined set of 
C-SCRM stakeholders should assess the impact of unauthorized changes in the supply chain. When 
impact is assessed, relevant stakeholders should help define and implement appropriate mitigation 
strategies to ensure a comprehensive resolution.

SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises should ensure that critical component assets within the 
information systems and networks are included in the asset inventory. The inventory must also include 
information for critical component accountability. Inventory information includes, for example, hardware 
inventory specifications, software license information, software version numbers, component owners, and – 
for networked components or devices – machine names and network addresses. Inventory specifications 
may include the manufacturer, device type, model, serial number, and physical location. Enterprises should 
require their prime contractors to implement this control and flow down this requirement to relevant sub-
tier contractors. Enterprises should specify the requirements and how information flow is enforced to 
ensure that only the required information – and no more – is communicated to the various participants in 
the supply chain. If information is subsetted downstream, there should be information about who created 
the subset information. Enterprises should consider producing SBOMs for applicable and appropriate 
classes of software, including purchased software, open source software, and in-house software. 
Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F for additional guidance on SBOMs in accordance 
with Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity.

SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | AUTOMATED MAINTENANCE  
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The enterprise should implement automated maintenance 
mechanisms to ensure that changes to component inventory for the information systems and networks 
are monitored for installation, update, and removal. When automated maintenance is performed with a 
predefined frequency and with the automated collation of relevant inventory information about each 
defined component, the enterprise should ensure that updates are available to relevant stakeholders for 
evaluation. Predefined frequencies for data collection should be less predictable in order to reduce the 
risk of an insider threat bypassing security mechanisms.

SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | CENTRALIZED REPOSITORY 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises may choose to implement centralized inventories that 
include components from all enterprise information systems, networks, and their components. 
Centralized repositories of inventories provide opportunities for efficiencies in accounting for 
information systems, networks, and their components. Such repositories may also help enterprises 
rapidly identify the location and responsible individuals of components that have been compromised, 
breached, or are otherwise in need of mitigation actions. The enterprise should ensure that centralized 
inventories include the supply chain-specific information required for proper component accountability 
(e.g., supply chain relevance and information system, network, or component owner).

SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | ASSIGNMENT OF COMPONENTS TO SYSTEMS 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: When assigning components to systems, the enterprise should 
ensure that the information systems and networks with all relevant components are inventoried, 
marked, and properly assigned. This facilitates quick inventory of all components relevant to 
information systems and networks and enables tracking of components that are considered critical and 
require differentiating treatment as part of the information system and network protection activities.

Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises should ensure that licenses for software used within their 
information systems and networks are documented, tracked, and maintained. Tracking mechanisms should 
provide for the ability to trace users and the use of licenses to access control information and processes. As 
an example, when an employee is terminated, a “named user” license should be revoked, and the license 
documentation should be updated to reflect this change. Departments and agencies should refer to 
Appendix F to implement this guidance in accordance with Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s 
Cybersecurity.

SOFTWARE USAGE RESTRICTIONS | OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE  
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: When considering software, enterprises should review all options 
and corresponding risks, including open source or commercially licensed components. When using 
open source software (OSS), the enterprise should understand and review the open source 
community’s typical procedures regarding provenance, configuration management, sources, binaries, 
reusable frameworks, reusable libraries’ availability for testing and use, and any other information that 
may impact levels of exposure to cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. Numerous open 
source solutions are currently in use by enterprises, including in integrated development environments 
(IDEs) and web servers. The enterprise should:  
a. 
Track the use of OSS and associated documentation, 
b. Ensure that the use of OSS adheres to the licensing terms and that these terms are acceptable to the 
enterprise, 
c. 
Document and monitor the distribution of software as it relates to the licensing agreement to 
control copying and distribution, and  
d. Evaluate and periodically audit the OSS’s supply chain as provided by the open source developer 
(e.g., information regarding provenance, configuration management, use of reusable libraries, 
etc.). This evaluation can be done through obtaining existing and often public documents, as well

CM-12 INFORMATION LOCATION 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Information that resides in different physical locations may be subject to 
different cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain, depending on the specific location of the 
information. Components that originate or operate from different physical locations may also be subject to 
different supply chain risks, depending on the specific location of origination or operations. Enterprises 
should manage these risks through limiting access control and specifying allowable or disallowable 
geographic locations for backup/recovery, patching/upgrades, and information transfer/sharing. NIST SP 
800-53, Rev. 5 control enhancement CM-12 (1) is a mechanism that can be used to enable automated

CM-13 DATA ACTION MAPPING 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: In addition to personally identifiable information, understanding and 
documenting a map of system data actions for sensitive or classified information is necessary. Data action 
mapping should also be conducted to map Internet of Things (IoT) devices, embedded or stand-alone IoT 
systems, or IoT system of system data actions. Understanding what classified or IoT information is being 
processed, its sensitivity and/or effect on a physical thing or physical environment, how the sensitive or IoT 
information is being processed (e.g., if the data action is visible to an individual or is processed in another 
part of the system), and by whom provides a number of contextual factors that are important for assessing 
the degree of risk. Data maps can be illustrated in different ways, and the level of detail may vary based on 
the mission and business needs of the enterprise. The data map may be an overlay of any system design 
artifact that the enterprise is using. The development of this map may necessitate coordination between 
program and security personnel regarding the covered data actions and the components that are identified 
as part of the system.

FAMILY: CONTINGENCY PLANNING 
[FIPS 200] specifies the Contingency Planning minimum security requirement as follows: 
Organizations must establish, maintain, and effectively implement plans for emergency 
response, backup operations, and post-disaster recovery for organizational information 
systems to ensure the availability of critical information resources and continuity of 
operations in emergency situations.  
Cybersecurity supply chain contingency planning includes planning for alternative suppliers of 
system components, alternative suppliers of systems and services, alternative delivery routes for 
critical system components, and denial-of-service attacks on the supply chain. Such contingency 
plans help ensure that existing service providers have an effective continuity of operations plan, 
especially when the provider is delivering services in support of a critical mission function. 
Additionally, many techniques used for contingency planning, such as alternative processing 
sites, have their own supply chains with their own attendant cybersecurity risks. Enterprises 
should ensure that they understand and manage cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain 
and dependencies related to the contingency planning activities as necessary.  
CP-1 
POLICY AND PROCEDURES 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises should integrate C-SCRM into the contingency planning 
policy and related SCRM Strategy/Implementation Plan, policies, and SCRM Plan. The policy should 
cover information systems and the supply chain network and, at a minimum, address scenarios such as:  
a. 
Unplanned component failure and subsequent replacement; 
b. Planned replacement related to feature improvements, maintenance, upgrades, and modernization; 
and 
c. 
Product and/or service disruption.

CONTINGENCY PLAN 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises should define and implement a contingency plan for the 
supply chain information systems and network to ensure that preparations are in place to mitigate the loss 
or degradation of data or operations. Contingencies should be put in place for the supply chain, network, 
information systems (especially critical components), and processes to ensure protection against 
compromise and provide appropriate failover and timely recovery to an acceptable state of operations.

failover (to include personnel, equipment, and network resources) to reduce or prevent service 
interruption or ensure timely recovery. Enterprises should ensure that contingency planning 
requirements are defined as part of the service-level agreement. The agreement may have specific 
terms that address critical components and functionality support in case of denial-of-service attacks to 
ensure the continuity of operations. Enterprises should coordinate with external service providers to 
identify service providers’ existing contingency plan practices and build on them as required by the 
enterprise’s mission and business needs. Such coordination will aid in cost reduction and efficient 
implementation. Enterprises should require their prime contractors who provide a mission- and 
business-critical or -enabling service or product to implement this control and flow down this 
requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors.
