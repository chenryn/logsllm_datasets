Assistant: This log chunk shows that the LeaseRenewer process is failing to renew a lease for [DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1] for 139-144 seconds. The RMCommunicator Allocator is also having difficulty connecting to the server, and is retrying with a fixed sleep time. Additionally, address changes are being detected for both the LeaseRenewer and RMCommunicator Allocator processes.
