### Summary of Log Chunk

This log chunk, spanning from 18:07:17 to 18:07:23 on October 18, highlights several recurring issues in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and Resource Manager (RM) components. The key points are as follows:

1. **Lease Renewal Failures**:
   - The `LeaseRenewer` process, associated with `msrabi@msra-sa-41:9000`, is failing to renew the lease for the client `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1`.
   - The failure persists for a duration ranging from 139 to 144 seconds.
   - The system indicates that it will retry the lease renewal shortly after each failure.

2. **Resource Manager Communication Issues**:
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` is experiencing difficulties in establishing a connection to the server at `msra-sa-41:8030`.
   - The allocator is configured to retry the connection up to 10 times, with a fixed sleep time of 1000 milliseconds between retries.
   - Each attempt to connect results in an error message: "ERROR IN CONTACTING RM."

3. **Address Changes**:
   - Both the `LeaseRenewer` and `RMCommunicator Allocator` processes detect changes in the server address.
   - For the `LeaseRenewer`, the old address is `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000`, and the new address is `msra-sa-41:9000`.
   - For the `RMCommunicator Allocator`, the old address is `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030`, and the new address is `msra-sa-41:8030`.

### Detailed Analysis

- **Lease Renewal Failures**:
  - The `LeaseRenewer` is responsible for maintaining the lease on HDFS files to ensure that the client can continue to write to them.
  - The repeated failures to renew the lease suggest a potential issue with network connectivity or server availability.
  - The system's retry mechanism is in place, but the persistent failure over multiple attempts indicates a more systemic problem.

- **Resource Manager Communication Issues**:
  - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` is crucial for managing resource allocation in Hadoop.
  - The repeated errors in contacting the RM suggest a possible network issue or a problem with the RM service itself.
  - The retry policy is designed to handle transient issues, but the consistent failure suggests a more significant problem.

- **Address Changes**:
  - The detected address changes may be due to a change in the network configuration or a DNS update.
  - These changes could be causing the communication issues, as the client and server may be temporarily out of sync.
  - It is important to verify that the new addresses are correct and that the network configuration is stable.

### Recommendations

- **Investigate Network Connectivity**: Check the network connectivity between the client and the HDFS and RM servers.
- **Verify Server Availability**: Ensure that the HDFS and RM services are running and available.
- **Check Configuration**: Review the network and Hadoop configuration to ensure that the addresses and ports are correctly set.
- **Monitor Logs**: Continue to monitor the logs for any additional errors or warnings that may provide further insight into the root cause.

By addressing these issues, the stability and reliability of the Hadoop cluster can be improved.
