Introduction
•
On-chip debug interfaces (such as JTAG) 
are a well-known hardware attack vector
-
Extract program code or data
-
Modify memory contents
-
Affect device operation on-the-fly
-
Provide chip-level control of a target device
-
Used as a stepping stone to further an attack
•
Identifying interfaces can sometimes be 
difficult and/or time consuming
Goal
•
Create an easy-to-use, open source tool to 
simplify the process
Design Specifications

Demonstration
Possible Limitations
•
No supported interface exists
•
Interface is physically disconnected
-
Cut traces, missing jumpers/0 ohm resistors
•
Interface isn't being properly enabled
-
Password protected, other pin settings needed
•
Signaling mismatch
-
Incorrect voltage levels, strong pull resistors on target
•
Abnormal target behavior due to "fuzzing" 
unknown pins
*** Additional reverse engineering will be necessary
