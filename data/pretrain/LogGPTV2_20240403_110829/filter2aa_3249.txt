#### Introduction
On-chip debug interfaces, such as JTAG, are well-known vectors for hardware attacks. These interfaces can be used to:
- Extract program code or data
- Modify memory contents
- Affect device operation in real-time
- Provide chip-level control of a target device
- Serve as a stepping stone for further attacks

Identifying these interfaces can sometimes be challenging and time-consuming.

#### Goal
The goal is to create an easy-to-use, open-source tool that simplifies the process of identifying on-chip debug interfaces.

#### Design Specifications
- **Open Source/Hackable/Expandable:** The tool should be open-source, allowing for modifications and expansions.
- **Command-Based Interface:** User interaction through a command-based interface.
- **Input Protection:** Protection against potential damage from incorrect input.
- **Adjustable Target Voltage:** Adjustable voltage levels to match the target device.
- **Off-the-Shelf Components:** Use of readily available components.
- **Hand-Solderable PCB:** A printed circuit board (PCB) that can be assembled by hand.
- **2x5 Headers Compatibility:** Compatible with Bus Pirate probes, as documented at [Dangerous Prototypes](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate).

#### Hardware Overview
- **Target Interface (24 Channels):** Supports 24 channels for interfacing with the target device.
- **Propeller Microcontroller:** Central processing unit for the tool.
- **USB Interface:** For communication with a host computer.
- **Input Protection Circuitry:** To safeguard against electrical surges.
- **Level Translation:** Ensures proper voltage levels between the tool and the target device.
- **Status Indicators:** LEDs or other indicators to provide status feedback.
- **Op-Amp/DAC:** Operational amplifier and digital-to-analog converter for signal conditioning.

#### Demonstration
A demonstration of the tool's capabilities will be provided, showcasing its ability to identify and interact with on-chip debug interfaces.

#### Possible Limitations
- **No Supported Interface Exists:** The target device may not have a supported debug interface.
- **Interface is Physically Disconnected:**
  - Cut traces
  - Missing jumpers or 0-ohm resistors
- **Interface Not Properly Enabled:**
  - Password-protected
  - Additional pin settings required
- **Signaling Mismatch:**
  - Incorrect voltage levels
  - Strong pull resistors on the target device
- **Abnormal Target Behavior Due to "Fuzzing" Unknown Pins:** This may require additional reverse engineering to resolve.
