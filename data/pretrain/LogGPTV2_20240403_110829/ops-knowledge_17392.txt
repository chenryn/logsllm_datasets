**Running a Python Script from the Command Line**

To run your Python script from the command line, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Command Line:**
   - On Windows, you can use `Command Prompt` or `PowerShell`.
   - On macOS or Linux, you can use `Terminal`.

2. **Navigate to the Directory Containing Your Script:**
   Use the `cd` (change directory) command to navigate to the folder where your Python script is located. For example:
   ```sh
   cd path/to/your/script
   ```

3. **Run the Python Script:**
   Once you are in the correct directory, you can run your script using the following command:
   ```sh
   python myscript.py
   ```
   - Ensure that `python` is correctly installed and added to your system's PATH.
   - If you have multiple versions of Python installed, you might need to use `python3` instead of `python` on macOS or Linux.

4. **Verify the Script Execution:**
   - Check the output in the command line to ensure your script is running as expected.
   - If there are any errors, review the error messages and make the necessary adjustments to your script.
