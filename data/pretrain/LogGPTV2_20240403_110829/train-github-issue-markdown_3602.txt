### Is there an existing issue for this?
  * I have searched the existing issues
### Current Behavior
New lines in arguments supplied to `npx` are replaced with \n when reading via
process.argv
So "  
" becomes "\n". This behaviour is not reproducible if running a bin script
directly in the command line (`./bin.js "$ARG"` and not `npx package-with-bin
"$ARG"`)
### Expected Behavior
New lines in process.argv args to be represented as "  
"
### Steps To Reproduce
  1. bin.js:
    #!/usr/bin/env node
    const value = process.argv[2];
    console.log(value);
  2. package.json:
      "bin" : {
        "package-with-bin": "./bin.js"
      },
  2. npm publish
  3. create a file with multiple lines
  4. 
    npx package-with-bin "$(cat multilinefile)"
### Environment
  * OS: macOS Big Sur 11.3.1
  * Node: v15.12.0
  * npm: 7.8.0
