Stalking a City for Fun 
and Frivolity
“Pull pin, point toward privacy insurance claimant”

Everything leaks too 
much data.
At every level, we’ve forgotten that privacy, not just 
security, should be a goal.
It is no longer possible to 
“blend in to the crowd.”
Certain assumptions, and many action movies, will have 
to be adjusted.
Every scene where an action hero dives into a mall with 10K people and the Feds say “dang, 
we lost him?” Yeah, that won’t work anymore.
Fundamental changes 
are needed to ﬁx this.
So we’re probably doomed. But it’s going to be a fun 
time in the interim.
And I mean both technical changes---more on this later---and cultural ones: it needs to 
*NOT* be OK to request too much data, let alone to store it or transmit it. And I say this as 
someone who has worked on software that millions of people use EVERY DAY: we *cannot* 
leak private data, or we have lost the only thing we do better than our adversaries, and the 
only reason anyone should trust developers.

Surveillance

I. Foreword: The Democratization of Surveillance
A. "Security is really the government's area."
1. This was actually said to me by my sister recently, indicating that I'm failing in my 
duty to educate my family.
2. Those of us in this room know that the government isn't very good at securing 
things by means *other* than throwing them in prison for large amounts of time.
3. Nonetheless, the government has a near-monopoly on surveillance.
“Only the Good Guys”

4. When it doesn't, the perception of the general public is that "only good guys" have access 
to terrifying surveillance technology. This is *our fault* for not correcting this misperception, 
though groups reporting on, e.g., all the BlueCoat boxes they've found in repressive 
governments are certainly helping. Heck, PRISM was leaked, and this is *still* the thing I’m 
hearing: people think “hey, the NSA needs that.”
“Sunlight is the best disinfectant”
http://www.ﬂickr.com/photos/andyz/3857625392
B. "Sunlight is the best disinfectant."
1. A recent study showed that cops wearing sunglass cameras were 88% less likely to 
commit actions resulting in complaints, and 60% less likely to use force; when they did use 
force, those officers wearing lapel cameras were consistent in using the least amount of force 
possible in a situation. This effect was not duplicated in officers refusing to wear the 
cameras.
2. If we can see what's going on---if we can look back at our government---we 
have the opportunity to make sure it works as efficiently and safely as possible. If not, we are 
subject to blackmail, extortion, and threats. (See Aaron Swartz.)
So we need sunlight---but we need it quickly, and where our natural inclination, our natural 
sunlight, is not. Those of you who are weapons buffs may know that this isn’t a photo of the 
sun: it’s a picture of the blast caused by Tsar Bomba, the largest nuclear weapon ever 
detonated.
So I get called a stalker

Wait, wrong stalker. This is an adorable cat, apparently named Stalker. People don’t call me 
an adorable cat.
So I get called a stalker
http://www.ﬂickr.com/photos/dcagne/424124810
Much better. As I was saying,
C. Why I do "creepy" work.
1. The only effective way to raise the issue of creeping surveillance and loss of 
privacy is to make clear that *anyone*, not just "the good guys," can use this technology for 
good or for evil.
2. The only way to make it clear is, of course, to release software that does it in a 
nice, user-friendly package.
CreepyDOL is:
• a distributed sensor network that 
combines wireless snifﬁng, distributed 
C&C, 3D visualization, and “grenade” 
encryption to do real-time personnel 
tracking and true-identity theft on a major 
urban area. It’s Stalking as a Service!
Complication: Weev
Or Andrew Auernheimer, if you prefer.
The United States Government 
has declared a holy war against 
legitimate security research.
Some of us think that’s not a good idea.
It doesn’t matter whether 
you like Weev or not.
Mighty Casey got three strikes, but we get only one; “They claimed it was for 
the sake of their grandparents and grandchildren, but it was of course for the 
sake of their grandparent’s grandchildren, and their grandchildren’s 
grandparents.” (Douglas Adams)
The time to ﬁght private ex post facto laws is now---because once ratiﬁed by a Court of 
Appeals, it will be a generation before we get to try again. So set aside any dislike you may 
have for Weev---perhaps for the best of reasons---and act in your own enlightened self-
interest. Or everyone in this room will be in prison soon.
Amicus Brief of Meredith 
Patterson, Brendan O'Connor, 
Sergey Bratus, Gabriella Coleman, 
Peyton Engel, Matthew Green, 
Dan Hirsch, Dan Kaminsky, 
Samuel Liles, Shane MacDougall, 
Jericho, Space Rogue, and Mudge
And Alex Muentz, another hacker and a full lawyer, who was 
willing to take a law student’s brief and submit it to the 
Circuit Court of Appeals.
All of the names on this list are big deals. Meredith Patterson from LangSec, Sergey Bratus, 
Patron Saint of the Gospel of Weird Machines, Crypto Engineer and Professor Matt Green, Dan 
Kaminsky, Jericho, Space Rogue, Mudge... the list goes on. And that should tell you how 
scared the entire community is, and should be; it touches all of us, whether we’re DARPA 
program managers, professors, or itinerant hackers.
In the meantime, there will be a 
chilling effect, as we cannot trust 
legal actions not to be prosecuted 
anyway.
Therefore, CreepyDOL has not been used to take on an 
entire city. It’s been tested, and parts of it have been tested 
with extremely high amounts of data, but I leave the next step, 
world domination, to a braver researcher.
Extremely Serious Disclaimer

This presentation may contain conﬁdential and/or legally privileged information. If it 
does, and you are not the intended recipient, then the sender hereby requests that 
you notify him of his mistake and destroy all copies in your possession. The sender

qualms about indulging in the more obnoxious trademarks of legalese, including but 
not limited to (i) the phrase “including but not limited to”, (ii) the use of “said” as 
an adjective, (iii) re-naming conventions that have little to no basis in vernacular 
English and, regardless, never actually recur (hereinafter referred to as “the 1980

This disclaimer exists for precisely one reason—to make this presentation appear 
more professional. This disclaimer shall not be construed as a guarantee of actual 
professionalism on the part of the sender. Any actual professionalism contained 
herein is purely coincidental and is in no way attributable to the presence of this

To be clear: I do not endorse using this software, or any software, for criminal purposes. 
We're hackers, not criminals. I want the fact of this software's existence to help shape habits 
and, hopefully, the next generations of mobile devices; perhaps they won't be designed (at 
the protocol level) to leak so much information so widely.
DARPA Cyber Fast 
Track
• CreepyDOL is not CFT work
• DARPA tries hard not to build stuff that 
creeps people out this much, and they’re 
very nice people.
• That said, two CFT contracts did let me 
build two of the core systems: Reticle, and 
the visualization system.
• Thanks, Mudge!

Goal: Passive Wireless
http://www.ﬂickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163911718
II. Goals
A. How much data can be extracted from passive wireless monitoring?
1. More than just from a network trace---remember that when not connected to a 
wireless network, WiFi devices send out lists of their known networks, asking if anyone can 
help them.
2. As soon as a device thinks it's connected to WiFi, all its background sync services 
will kick off again---DropBox, iMessage, all the rest. So we'll immediately know that certain 
services will be in play.
3. Over unencrypted WiFi, all the traffic sent by a device is exposed. Even if we can't 
see both sides of every message, we can learn a lot from what we do see---especially if we 
know how a given protocol operates.
4. How much better could we do if we had not one sensor, but ten? Spread out over 
an area? Now we have geolocation, time and place analysis, etc.
5. If we're tracking over a large area, we don't just want to know traffic and devices: 
we want to know people. Can we take data and ﬁnd people? (I don't want your SSN, I want 
your name. And really, I want to know enough about you to blackmail you; information is 
control.)
Goal: Large-Scale Sensing Without 
Centralized Communications
http://www.ﬂickr.com/photos/christmaswithak/2732857205
B. Can we do large-scale sensing without centralized communications?
1. If we centralize communications, life is simple; everyone phones home---but a 
compromised node gives every attacker the location of the mothership.
2. Centralized communications decrease resistance to attack, and prevent you from 
responding agilely to attack.
Goal: Intelligibility
http://www.slideshare.net/EmilandDC/dear-nsa-let-me-take-care-ou
C. Can we present massive amounts of this data in a way that is intelligible by mortals? 
User-friendly? Still secure?
1. Group One of high security products: incredible technology, terrible UI. This 
causes low adoption, or (possibly worse) mistakes in use. Systems fail, people die. Examples: 
Pidgin-OTR, or PGP/OpenPGP.
2. Group Two: Concerns about technology, great UI. This causes adoption, but can 
cause massive problems later (if the concerns are borne out). Examples: HushMail, Silent 
Circle.
3. Group Three: Good technology, great UI. This is wonderful, but incredibly hard to 
do (because UI masters are usually not security wizards). Example: CryptoCat, RedPhone.
4. We would aspire to have CreepyDOL be in Group Three, through a variety of 
methods to ensure secure communication in relatively-intelligible ways. *This is an ongoing 
process.* Our code is open source, to allow veriﬁcation, and will be released in the coming 
weeks.

Background: Academic Sensor 
Networks Rock!
http://www.ﬂickr.com/photos/22240293@N05/3912598338
(This is the MIT CS building, if you’re wondering. They have an awesome sensor network, and 
their papers are always accompanied by the *weirdest* ﬂoor plans.)
III. Background
A. Sensor Networks
1. Academic researchers have spent tons of time and resources on these. MANETs, 
other advances in technology have resulted.
2. A lot of these have uW power levels, and sacriﬁce languages, OS, and cost to get 
there---especially cost, with many nodes costing $500 or more. Each.
3. I can't afford this. I want something I can afford to break, to lose, and even to have 
stolen. I want it an order of magnitude cheaper, and I want it to run Linux. (Ubuntu or 
Debian, if possible.)
Background: Large-
Scale Surveillance
• Remember, we knew this was happening before PRISM 
was announced
• In my original outline: “One can assume that they have 
solved all of the problems involved in CreepyDOL 
before me, and that they should, rightfully, be cited as 
prior art. I'd love to do so; as soon as they publish their 
work, I'll be happy to cite them.”
• Heh heh heh.
• Pour one out for the Intelligence Community: a lot of 
this stuff is a pain to ﬁgure out

Hardware!
So now let’s talk about system architecture. First: Hardware.
F-BOMB v.1 (ShmooCon 2012)
A. Hardware: F-BOMB, version 2 (Falling/Ballistically-launched Object that Makes 
Backdoors)
1. Originally presented at ShmooCon 2012. At that time, this was based on the 
Marvell Sheeva board, the same board used by the Pwnie Plug that’s been selling so well for 
years. To keep costs down, I was actually buying PogoPlugs, a rebranding of the Sheeva 
board, as they were being sold as essentially ﬁre sales, and stripping out their guts.
Conveniently, (next slide)
It ﬁts in a CO Detector
No one ever checks their CO detector to see if it has become a node in a sensor network.
The new one ﬁts much better into this case; much less cutting is necessary.
F-BOMB v.2
2. Now based on the Raspberry Pi Model A, because it's awesome, runs an easier 
version of Linux (Debian vs. Arch), and I can actually get it for cheaper than the salvage 
PogoPlugs. We also get signiﬁcantly reduced power consumption, it runs at a better voltage 
(5v instead of 12v), it’s physically much smaller and lighter, and it actually has more RAM and 
processing power on board. You can see there’s a bit of cord sticking out of each F-BOMB in 
this photo; this is because I mis-measured when buying the cas. But the Raspberry Pi is 
actually much smaller than the Sheeva board, so it ﬁts better into smaller objects. (Hold up 
one.)
These devices use USB power, which means that I can plug them into walls (you can see an 
Apple-style USB power adapter in the lower-left), but also into USB batteries, MintyBoost kits, 
or anything else that gives me 5v in this ubiquitous form factor. They do not use that port as
