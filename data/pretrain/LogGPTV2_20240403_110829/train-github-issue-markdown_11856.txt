I just upgraded our project from symfony2.4 to symfony2.6, everything went
fine except web profiler is not working correctly, when I page source code, I
found web profiler's javascript code are being included twice.
And after web page is loaded, profiler alert "404 message".
I temporary fixed this problem by adding this code:
Symfony/Component/HttpKernel/EventListener/ProfilerListener.php
    /**
     * Handles the onKernelResponse event.
     *
     * @param FilterResponseEvent $event A FilterResponseEvent instance
     */
    public function onKernelResponse(FilterResponseEvent $event)
    {
        // Start temporary fix
        static $ran = false;
        if (!$ran) {
            $ran = true;
            return;
        }
        // End temporary fix
        $master = $event->isMasterRequest();
        if ($this->onlyMasterRequests && !$master) {
            return;
        }
Can someone upgraded to 2.6, help me a way to solve this problem?
