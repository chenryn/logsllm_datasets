Challenge http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-override-styles-in-
subsequent-css has an issue. Please describe how to reproduce it, and include
links to screenshots if possible.
When I loaded the page for this lesson, the 'Hello World" text on the right
side of the screen is displayed twice for some reason. If I reset the page, or
even start editing the code, the second copy of the text disappears. It's more
of a weird error than a bug, but I thought I'd report it since I took a
screenshot of it.
