The first failure happened at ~9:20 PST 29/04/2015. The failure looks like
that:
/go/src/github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/_output/dockerized/go/src/github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/test/e2e/density.go:158  
Expected error:  
: {  
s: "Controller my-hostname-density3000-75cb549b-ee8e-11e4-ae78-42010af01555:
Only found 3052 replicas out of 3000",  
}  
Controller my-hostname-density3000-75cb549b-ee8e-11e4-ae78-42010af01555: Only

not to have occurred
It seems that because of some reason we are starting much more pods within a
replication controller than expected. Another related failure:
Expected error:  
: {  
s: "Number of reported pods changed: 3222 vs 3000",  
}  
Number of reported pods changed: 3222 vs 3000  
not to have occurred
