# Bug report
We have a multi-page website that uses Webpack v4. Some pages have entry
files. All pages have UI that needs JS to run.
In the past, we have had an entry that acts as a global JS initializer. This
contains code for the site navigation, modernizr, and other global utilities.
This is site level, consider it page agnostic code.
Additionally, we have entries for some pages that have additional JS driven
UI. The entry files are not mapped to all pages though, so some pages will not
have an entry.
When we build our  tags, we used to do something like this:

on-a-single-page-chunks-are-duplicated-unneces?noredirect=1
**What is the current behavior?**  
We are encountering a bug in Webpack v4 where chunks that are shared between
**global** and **mypage** are redundantly included in each bundle. Webpack is
not aware that these files exist on the same page together, so it treats them
as if they do not have access to eachother. We have been unable to locate a
configuration that creates this link.
We need this link because we cannot make an entry for each page that imports
an init file from **global.js** , and even if we could, it would cause
unnecessary overhead. A clear separation of concerns is ideal, where global
actions and page-specific actions live in different files and do not reference
each other.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**  
Create a config with more than one entry, and include both in the same page.
Add some imports to files that are used on both entries. Analyze the bundle
and you'll find the same chunks in both files.
Example config file here:
https://gist.github.com/lostPixels/fef3f0cc4a3e99bf526249c605c2096f
**What is the expected behavior?**  
Webpack should optimize the entries to include only one chunk, and share it
across multiple entries that live together in one HTML document. The config
should offer a way to describe these connections, and not assume that a page
can only contain one entry file.
