## 🐛 Bug

When attempting to build PyTorch, I encountered an error related to a CUDA header. Since I am not building for a GPU, I am unsure if it is necessary to include the GPU-related components in the build process.

### Error Details

The build process failed with the following output:

### Additional Information

- I am not building for a GPU, so I do not need the GPU-related components.
- The build process seems to be failing due to a CUDA header, even though I have disabled GPU support.

### Request for Assistance

Could you please provide guidance on how to exclude the GPU-related components from the build process or resolve this issue?
