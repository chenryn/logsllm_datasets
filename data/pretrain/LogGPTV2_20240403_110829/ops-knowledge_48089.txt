User: I have a Python 3 script that is going to be doing some regex substitution on some Rich Text Files (rtf) and I would like to be able to print out a whole directory's files on Windows, Linux, and Mac.  
Is there a way to print to the OS's default printer so that it works in all platforms?
Assistant: With the OS module you can print files in Windows  or higher.
