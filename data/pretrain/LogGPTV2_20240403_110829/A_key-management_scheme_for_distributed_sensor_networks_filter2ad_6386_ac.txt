increase. From Table I, it is observed that when the difference
tolerance t increases, the FAR also increases. This is because
if the system could tolerate more different features between
the sender and the receiver, the possibility of matching two
feature sets that do not belong to the same person increase
and thus the FAR increase. In contrast to the FAR, the FRR
decreases when t increases, this is because when t increases,

these two feature sets coming from the same person are more
likely to be matched. Thus, the probability of recovering one
set using the other sets also increases.

Figure 6 and Figure 7 show the FAR and FRR performance
when the degree of the monic polynomial s changes (the
difference tolerance t is set to 2). The degree of the polynomial
s should satisfy s >= 4 in order not to compromise the
security [17]. It is shown in Figure 6 that the FAR decrease
when s increase. When t is ﬁxed, the bigger s means that more
shared features in the feature set is needed to successfully
recover the secret k. Thus, the probability of mismatching
the feature sets decreases. In Figure 7, the FRR increases
when s increases. This is due to the fact that if more common
elements of the feature are needed, it is more likely for the
system to reject the two feature sets that coming from the
same person. The comparison between the PSKA [8] and
the proposed ECG-IJS scheme in term of the FAR and FRR
performance also shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. Though the
FAR performance of the proposed ECG-IJS is a little worse
than that of PSKA, the FRR performance of the proposed
ECG-IJS scheme is much better than that of PSKA. Also, as
shown in Table II,the HTER performance of the ECG-IJS is
better than that of PSKA on all polynomial degree s. We will
also further demonstrate the energy saving advantages of the
proposed approach in Section V.
Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the FAR performance and the
FRR performance respectively for different polynomial degree
s and different tolerance t. It demonstrates that choosing cer-
tain degrees and tolerance levels can achieve required security
performance. However, the complexity of the computation is

C. Energy Efﬁciency Analysis
The wireless channel condition in WBSNs is different from
that of free space [26]. In this section, ﬁrstly, we describe the
wireless channels over the human body in WBSNs. Secondly,
we introduce an energy consumption model which is used
to evaluate the energy efﬁciency of the proposed ECG-IJS
scheme. At last, the energy efﬁciency of the ECG-IJS scheme
is compared with the PSKA.

the energy consumption is evaluated by a three-cases model
proposed in [31]. In the three-cases model, an acknowledge-
ment is used to represent a successfully transmission.

1) Path Loss Near Human Body: The path loss models
for WBSNs either using narrowband radio signals or Ultra
Wide Band (UWB) are investigated in [27] [28]. It is reported
that the radio signals experience great losses and the value
of the path loss exponent (cid:11) varies greatly in WBSNs. The
path loss exponent for propagation in free space is equal to
2. But the path loss around the human body tremendously
exceeds that of free space. The path loss exponent is about 3
for line of sight (LOS) propagation, while in the non-line of
sight (NLOS) situations the path loss exponent is 7 [29].
2) Energy Model: In our evaluation, we took the conﬁg-
uration of the Chipcon CC2420 [30] that is widely used in
Low Rate Wireless Personnel Area Network (LR-WPAN). As
shown in Table III, the CC2420 supports eight transmission
power levels and a typical supply current. Ir = 19:7mA is
required to receive the signal. The transmission rate Rb is
250kb=s.
Several researchers have devoted to offering an accurate
energy model of Chipcon CC2420 [31] [32] [33]. In this paper,
Figure 10 depicts the timing for three cases being consid-
ered for the packet transmission: Case 1. Success: both data
packets and acknowledgement are successfully transmitted,
Case 2. PF: Unsuccessful data packet
transmission; Case
3. AF: Successful data packet transmission followed by an
unsuccessful acknowledgement transmission. Then the total
energy consumption can be calculated as follows:
Ep2p((cid:1)) = Ep2p((cid:1)jSuccess)+
Ep2p((cid:1)jP F ) (cid:2) NP F ((cid:1)) + Ep2p((cid:1)jAF ) (cid:2) NAF ((cid:1))
(3)
where Ep2p((cid:1)jSuccess), Ep2p((cid:1)jP F ) and Ep2p((cid:1)jAF ) are
the energy required for case 1, successful transmission, case
2, packet failure and case 3, acknowledgement failure. NP F ((cid:1))
and NP F ((cid:1)) are the expected number of packet transmission
failures, respectively. For case 1 and case 3, after a data
packet is received correctly at the receiver’s site, the receiver
will transmit an ACK packet. Thus, the energy consumed by
sending a packet successfully is calculated as follows:
Ep2p((cid:1)jSuccess) = Ep2p((cid:1)jAF )
=
(Lpack + LAck)(It(i) + Ir)VS
Rb
(4)
For case 2,
the expected number of
retransmissions
NP F (i; d; Lpack) is based on the probability of receiving the
data packet in errors. Given these errors that are independent
and identically distributed (i.i.d.), then NP F (i; d; Lpack) is
calculated as follows:

For case 3, assuming the errors of data packet and the
ACK packet transmissions are independent, then the expected
number of retransmissions NAF (i; d; Lpack) is described as
follows:
NAF (i; d; Lpack) =
(1 (cid:0) PP ER(i; d; Lpack))(1 (cid:0) PP ER(i; d; LACK))
PP ER(i; d; Lpack)
(7)
where PP ER(i; d; LACK) is the probability of the ACK
packet errors. It is a function of bit error rate PBER as shown
in the following:
The CC2420 uses O-QPSK modulation, thus PBER is
PP ER(i; d; L) = 1 (cid:0) (1 (cid:0) PBER)L

where Eb(i; d) is the energy per bit and N0 is the noise
spectral density. Pr(i; d) is the expected received power in
dBm when the transmit power is Pt(i), it can be calculated in
the following:
Pr(i; d) = Pt(i)(cid:0)

propagation, and (cid:21) is the wave length which is related to the
carrier frequency fc by (cid:21) = c=fc.
3) Simulation Results: To evaluate energy efﬁciency per-
formance of the proposed ECG-IJS scheme, the above en-
ergy model is used to calculate the energy consumed for
successfully transmitting a packet. The parameters used is
given in Table IV. For both the PSKA scheme and the ECG-
IJS scheme proposed in this paper, Figure 11 presents the
Energy consumption for successfully transmitting a package
at different transmit power.
Figure 11, shows that the proposed ECG-IJS scheme con-
sumes much less energy on all
transmission power in a
successful packet transmission. It saves up to 70% energy than
the PSKA scheme, which shows the energy efﬁciency of the
proposed ECG-IJS scheme.
