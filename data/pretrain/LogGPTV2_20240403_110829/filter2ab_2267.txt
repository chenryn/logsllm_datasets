### Title: eBPF ELFs: Jumping Through the Windows

**Abstract:**

eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) tracing is an emerging technology in the EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) and infrastructure domains, offering high-speed instrumentation and telemetry for events, processes, and network connections. Native to the Linux kernel, eBPF is widely used in endpoint security solutions such as Carbon Black and Windows Defender for Linux. In a significant development, Microsoft recently introduced a new eBPF tracing system for Windows, which is expected to become a primary telemetry provider in the near future.

The architecture of eBPF for Windows is intricate, leveraging program analysis to verify unsigned user code through abstract interpretation before executing it in a kernel context. Ensuring the integrity of this software is crucial. This research represents the first public effort to analyze and identify security vulnerabilities in the new eBPF for Windows implementation.

Our presentation will cover the following key areas:

1. **Capabilities and Security Model:**
   - An overview of the capabilities and security model of eBPF for Windows.
   
2. **Design and Attack Surface:**
   - Detailed examination of the eBPF API.
   - Analysis of the trusted static verifier and JIT (Just-In-Time) engine.
   - Exploration of the kernel implementation of trace hooks and telemetry providers.

3. **Vulnerability Discovery:**
   - A deep dive into the implementation details, uncovering vulnerabilities at multiple layers.
   - Discussion on the methods used to find these vulnerabilities, including fuzzing techniques applied to Windows eBPF components.
   - Live demonstrations of real-time bug discovery.

4. **Exploitation and Challenges:**
   - Examination of the challenges associated with exploiting memory corruption in the eBPF implementation on Windows.
   - Discussion on the unique difficulties posed by the Windows Protected Process environment.

Join us as we delve into this cutting-edge technology on Windows and explore the security implications of the new attack surface it introduces.
