1. THE EARLY SEMANTIC WEB
The original idea of the Semantic Web was to bring machine-readable
descriptions to the data and documents already on the Web, in order to
improve search and data usage. The Web was, and in most cases it still is, a
vast set of static and dynamically generated Web pages linked together.
Pages are written in HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language), a language that
is useful for publishing information intended only for human consumption.
Humans can read Web pages and understand them, but the inherent meaning
is not available in a way that allows interpretation by computers.
The Semantic Web aims at defining ways to allow Web information to be
used by computers not only for display purposes, but also for interoperability
and integration between systems and applications. One way to enable
machine-to-machine exchange and automated processing is to provide the
information in such a way that computers can understand it. To give
meaning to Web information, new standards and languages are being
investigated and developed. Well-known examples include the Resource
Description Framework (RDF) (RDF 2002) and the Web Ontology
Language (OWL) (OWL 2004). The descriptive information made available
by these languages allows characterizing individually and precisely the type
of resources in the Web and the relationships between resources.
Today, the Semantic Web is not only about increasing the expressiveness
of Web information to enable the automatic or semiautomatic processing of
Web resources and Web pages. Academia and industry have realized that the
Semantic Web can facilitate the integration and interoperability of intra- and
inter-business processes and systems, as well as enable the creation of global
infrastructures for sharing documents and data, make searching and reusing
information easier.
Figure 3-1 illustrates the various tasks for which semantic technologies
can be used. We can see that semantics can help not only system (semantic
machine interface), but also human integration and interoperability (human
machine interface). In both cases, semantic functions can be used to
discover, acquire and create semantic metadata and provision, present,
communicate, and act using semantics.

2. ONTOLOGIES: THE CORNERSTONE OF THE
SEMANTIC WEB
The Semantic Web relies on the theoretical research done in the context of
ontologies as a formal support for communication between agents and for
the exchange of knowledge representations. Ontology-based human
communication aims at reducing and eliminating terminological and

conceptual confusion by defining a shared understanding, that is, a unifying
framework enabling communication and cooperation amongst people in
reaching better inter-enterprise organization. Presently, one of the most
important roles an ontology plays in communication is that it provides
unambiguous definitions for terms used in a software system, but they can
also support communication, coordination, and cooperation between human
actors.
The use of ontologies for improving communication has already had
been shown to work in practice. Interesting examples of successful
ontologies include the Disease Ontology2 (a hierarchical and controlled
vocabulary for human disease representation), the FAO3 (Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) – which is committed to
help information dissemination by providing consistent access to
information for the community of people and organizations – and the Open
EDI ontology4 which defines the ontology for data management and
interchange between enterprises. Other well-known and successful ready-to-
use ontologies that have been developed include: CYC upper ontology5,
LinkBase6, Towntology project, DAML ontology library7, Ontolingua8,
OWL ontology library9, Kactus library10, and eClassOWL11.
The most referred-to definition for ontology is given by Gruber (Gruber
1993), describing an ontology as an explicit specification of
conceptualization. Explicit means that it cannot be implicitly assumed and
should be processable by machines. This definition has been criticized by
Guarino (Guarino 1998). After examining many possible interpretations of
ontology, Guarino concluded that an ontology describes a hierarchy of
concepts related by subsumption relationships; in more sophisticated cases,
suitable axioms are added in order to express other relationships between
concepts and to constrain their intended interpretation.
The effort of the Semantic Web community to apply semantic techniques
in open, distributed and heterogeneous Web environments are beginning to
pay off. Not only is the number of developed ontologies increasing,
dramatically but also the way that ontologies are published and used has

changed. We see a shift away from the first generation Semantic Web
applications towards a new generation of applications, designed to exploit
large amounts of heterogeneous semantic markup.
3. CHALLENGES FOR A NEW SEMANTIC WORLD
As every technological evolution, Semantic Web and ontologies need to
promote their unique value proposition for specific target groups in order to
achieve adoption. A common pitfall made in the studies of Semantic Web is
the limited focus on “technological perspectives” or in the other extreme the
difficulty to communicate the underlying capacity of semantics and
Ontologies to meet critical real world challenges. An interesting starting
point of analysis, which justifies also the contribution of this edition, relates
with some of the characteristics of our world and society.
3.1 Characteristics of a new world
We live in a world where information and knowledge are considered to be
key enablers of business and economic performance and critical pillars of
sustainable development. At global level the following are some of the
characteristics of the new world context:
• Globalization: Creation and consumption of knowledge and
information are made in the global context. From this perspective the
elimination of local boundaries and the exploitation of synergies and
capacities beyond local boundaries require advanced adoption
mechanisms that permit realization of opportunities, deep
understanding of threats and strategic fit to human and social networks
towards new levels of performance.
• Networking: In our era, business and economic activities as well as
competition require new models of business networking. Within this
context, advanced documentation of skills, competencies, business
models and context based collaboration define new demands for
advanced business and social networking at global level.
• Shared Models: A global consensus towards peace, development,
prosperity and a better world needs to be based on shared conceptual
models that define the average common understanding of human
societies for the “issues” that matters at global scale. And while this can
be perceived as a “too optimistic” scenario or it can be characterized as
wishful thinking case, in the Global information Landscape shared
models are required for interoperability, exploitation of synergies and
definition of new milestones for collective intelligence.
• Collective Intelligence: The increased capacities of networking as a
result of globalization and widespread adoption of share models has
resulted to the development of a global trend to applying collective
intelligence filters or collaborative filtering in the context of the global
information world. Such development challenges many traditional
models of business performance, marketing and profitability.
• Open Paradigm: This is a key new characteristic of our world.
Open paradigm relates with several complementary movements, like
the ones of open source software paradigm, open content, open access,
open knowledge, open research, open culture. The underlying idea has
an amazing capacity to support new business models and several
applications in the short and long term horizon.
3.2 Challenges for Semantic Web applications
The previous list of the characteristics of the modern world provides the
“playground” for the Semantic Web based applications. Globalization,
networking, share models, collective intelligence, open paradigm are only a
few of the silver bullets for the exploitation of Semantic Web technologies.
In the next list we summarize a selective list of challenges for Semantic Web
applications in close relevance to the previous discussion:
• Definition of new modes for human, knowledge and business
networking beyond local boundaries: Traditional business and
knowledge networking emphasized on a narrow perspective for the
ultimate objective of networking. Semantic Web through Ontologies
and Social networks anchors networking to well-defined conceptual
models that match information sources and human services. By
providing an infrastructure of shared semantics and Ontologies where
reasoning and trust are “process and service oriented”, we have a great
opportunity at business level.
• Globalizing information and definition of new Contexts for
value exploitation: The provision of local information assets at global
level and the design of new contexts for exploitation are for the
Semantic Web two of the key value proposition. The design of multiple
reference levels to the same set of information and knowledge delivers
a new level for dynamic, personalized systems.
• Delivering and integrating quality to information: One of the
main obstacles in the current web relates with a very limited
performance on the quality assessment of content. It seems that we
suffer from an enormous explosion of content diffusion and a very poor
performance on capacities to explore qualitative information. And
while information quality is a very subjective concept, the same
moment businesses and people as customers, citizens, patients, learners,
professionals, etc require systems and infrastructures that deliver
assessment models of information quality.
• Integration of isolated information assets: In any context,
personal, organizational or global the integration of isolated
information is a key challenge. The “value” related with integration is
always related with the inquiry. In simple words integration has always
a very concrete “gap” component. Individuals, Organizations, society
require integration for addressing specific performance gaps that relate
with limited capacity to build more meaningful services.
• Support of business value and co-located/distributed business
models: It is obvious that Semantic Web evolution requires the
adoption from industry. This critical milestone implies that Semantic
Web technologies can integrated to the business models of modern
organizations and businesses. As always such a requirement challenges
the strategic fit of technologies to business perspectives. From a
business strategy point of view there is a key demand to “translate” the
key aspects of Semantic Web technologies to business terminology.
Semantics, ontologies, resource description frameworks, etc, means
nothing to business people that have an absolute different way to
interpret business requirements.
• Promotion of a critical shift in humans understanding and
interacting with digital world: Semantic Web needs to respond to the
great demand of humans to explore new modes of interactivity with the
digital world. And it is obvious that people prefer to behave with
similar conscious and intelligent mechanisms. The soonest the
Semantic Web will prove its capacity to provide these intelligent
mechanisms the greatest its adoption and support at global level.
