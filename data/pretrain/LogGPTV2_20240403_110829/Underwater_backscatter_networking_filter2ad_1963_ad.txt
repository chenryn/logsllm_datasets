ergy harvesting designs [47]. The rectifier transforms the alternating
electrical signal coming from the transducer into a DC voltage by
passing it through diodes and capacitors. We employ a multi-stage
rectifier in order to passively amplify the voltage to the level that is
needed for activating the digital components of the circuit design.
The rectified DC charge is stored in a 1000 µF supercapacitor.
Recall from §3 that maximizing the energy harvesting efficiency
requires matching the output impedance of our piezoelectric trans-
ducer to the input impedance of the load (ZL = Z∗
s ). We use the
E4990A Impedance analyzer [35] to measure the output impedance
of the transducer as well as the input impedance of the load. Knowing
these impedances, we can solder an impedance matching network
(which consists of an inductor and a capacitor) between the piezo-
electric transducer and the rectifier. The values of inductance and
capacitance of the network can be derived from standard circuit
equations by substituting the load and source impedances [54].
The capacitor is connected to a low-dropout (LDO) voltage regu-
lator, the LP5900SD [74], the output of which is 1.8 V. The voltage
regulator drives the digital components of the circuit, ensuring they
are not damaged or operated in an unsteady mode.
Decoding. PAB’s decoder operates by envelope detection. In par-
ticular, recall that the downlink communication signal is encoded
using PWM, where a larger pulse width corresponds to a ‘1’ bit and
a shorter pulse width corresponds to a ‘0’ bit. In order to decode
these pulses, the receiver needs a simple edge detection mechanism
to identify the bit (pulse) boundaries and durations.
Our receiver design is inspired by the RFID WISP platform [85].
The design employs a Schmitt trigger that can discard small ampli-
tude changes due to noise and discretize the output into two main
voltage levels: high and low. A level shifter scales the voltage levels
to properly condition them as inputs to a microcontroller. We use the
TXB0302 [72], which incorporates both a trigger and a level shifter.
11This series design enables controlling the switches at a lower gate-to-source voltage
(VGS ) since the source is always at ground. This allows the microcontroller to switch
between the two states at a lower threshold voltage.

Our design also employs a pull-down transistor, as shown in Fig. 5
to improve both the energy harvesting efficiency and the decodability
of the downlink signal. Specifically, the pull-down transistor acts as
an open-circuit in the cold-start phase (i.e., when the super-capacitor
is charging) to ensure that all the incoming energy flows to the
capacitor enabling fast charging. Once the capacitor has enough
voltage to power on the voltage regulator and the microcontroller
(MCU), the MCU applies a voltage on the pull-down transistor
changing it to a closed circuit. While this leaks some of the energy
to ground, it also maximizes the difference between the high and
low voltage levels at the input to the Schmitt trigger, thus improving
the SNR for decoding the downlink PWM signal.
4.2.2 Microcontroller
To minimize the power consumption of our design, we use an ultra-
low power microcontroller, specifically the MSPG2553 MCU[75].
The microcontroller can operate with a supply voltage as low as
1.8 V and consumes less than 230 µA at 1.8V in active mode and
0.5 µA in low power mode (LMP3) with just one active clock using
a crystal oscillator operating at 32.8 kHz.
Upon powering up, the MCU prepares to receive and decode a
downlink command by enabling interrupts and initializing a timer
to detect a falling edge at its pin which is connected to the output
of the level shifter; then, it enters LMP3 mode. A falling edge at
the microcontroller’s input raises an interrupt waking up the MCU,
which enters active mode to compute the time interval between every
edge to decode bit ‘0’ or ‘1’ of the query, before going back to
low-power mode.
Upon successfully decoding downlink signals from the projector,
the MCU prepares for backscatter. It switches the timer to continuous
mode to enable controlling the switch at the backscatter frequency
and employs FM0 encoding as described in §3. An output pin of
the microcontroller is connected to the two switching transistors
enabling them to toggle the transducer between reflective and non-
reflective states.
The microcontroller can also be configured to communicate with
analog and digital peripheral sensors. The ADC pin is used for sam-
pling analog sensors and the I2C protocol is used to communicate
with digital sensors.
Implementation
5 EVALUATION
5.1
Our implementation setup consists of an acoustic projector, PAB
backscatter nodes, and a hydrophone receiver. The backscatter nodes
are designed and implemented as per our discussion in §4, so we
describe the remaining system components below.
(a) Transmitter. We implemented the transmitter using our in-house
transducers from §4.1 as projectors. Each projector was connected
to the output audio jack of a Lenovo Thinkstation PC through the
XLi2500 Two-channel 750W power amplifier [16]. We configure the
projector to transmit signals at different center frequencies between
12 kHz and 18 kHz. For different configurations, we change the
matching circuit to optimize the power transfer between the power
amplifier and the transducer. The transmitted signal is generated
using MATLAB and employs PWM where the ‘1’ bit is twice as
long as the ‘0’ bit. The transmitter’s downlink query includes a 9-bit

tank (Pool B) with a projector, hydrophone, and a PAB sensor.
preamble. The transmitter packet may also include commands for
the PAB backscatter node such as setting backscatter link frequency,
switching its resonance mode, or requesting certain sensed data like
pH, temperature, or pressure.
(b) Receiver. The receiver is implemented using the H2a hy-
drophone [3], whose sensitivity is -180dB re: 1V/µPa. The hy-
drophone is connected to the audio jack of a Lenovo Thinkstation.
We use the Audacity software package to record the received audio
signals. The signals are processed offline using a MATLAB-based
decoder. The decoder identifies the different transmitted frequencies
on the downlink using FFT and peak detection. It then downconverts
the signals to baseband by multiplying each of them with its respec-
tive carrier frequency. The receiver then employs a Butterworth filter
on each of the receive channels to isolate the signal of interest and
reduce interference from concurrent transmissions. Subsequently,
it performs standard packet detection and carrier frequency offset
(CFO) correction using the preamble.12 It then employs a maximum
likelihood decoder to decode the FM0 decoded bits. It can also use
the CRC to perform a checksum on the received packets and request
retransmissions of corrupted packets.
(c) Sensing Applications. We tested three types of sensing appli-
cations by interfacing the micro-controller with different sensors.
To measured acidity, we use the Mini pH Probe [4], which con-
nects to micro-controllers ADC using an LMP91200 Configurable
Analog Front End for Chemical Sensing Application [73]. We also
experimented with the MS5837-30BA Waterproof Digital Pressure
Sensor [71] to extract temperature and pressure. The sensor has a
digital interface which directly communicates with the MCU through
I2C communication protocol.
(d) Setups. We evaluated PAB in two main settings: Pool A is an
enclosed water tank of 1.3m depth and 3m × 4m rectangular cross-
section, and Pool B is another enclosed water tank of 1m depth and
1.2m × 10m rectangular cross section. We also validated that the
12In contrast to RF backscatter where the reader is typically full-duplex, PAB uses a
separate transmitter (projector) and receiver (hydrophone). Hence, the receiver observes
a CFO due to the different oscillators.

system operates correctly in an indoor swimming pool. Through-
out our evaluation, the transducers were submerged between 50cm
and 1m below the surface, and the distance between the projector,
hydrophone, and backscatter nodes were varied across our experi-
mental trials.
6 RESULTS
To evaluate PAB, we performed controlled experiments in the en-
closed water tanks described in §5.1. Our experiments test the ability
to use PAB for communication and study the communication and
energy harvesting performance as a function of distance, backscatter
rate, and concurrent transmissions.
We performed over 150 experimental trials in total. We varied the
backscatter rate, location, and depth of PAB’s transducers throughput
these experiments. We also varied the distance and placement with
respect to the projector and hydrophone.
6.1 Communication Performance
(a) BER-SNR Curves. First, we are interested in testing the ability
to communicate underwater using piezo-acoustic backscatter. The
performance of a communication system can be evaluated through
plots of the bit error rate to the signal to noise ratio, called the
BER-SNR curves [25, 58]. We computed the BER as the fraction
of correctly decoded bits to the total transmitted bits. We computed
the signal power as the squared channel estimate, and computed the
noise power as the squared difference between the received signal
and the transmitted signal multiplied by the channel estimate.
Fig. 7 plots the BER-SNR curves of PAB in log-log scale. The
plot is generated from our experimental trials across the various
bitrates. As expected the BER decreases with increasing SNR. Our
decoder is able to decode with a minimum SNR around 2 dB, which
is typical for biphase modulation techniques like FM0. The BER
drops to 10−5 at SNRs higher than 11 dB. We set the lowest BER to
10−5 since our packet size is always smaller than 105 bits.
(b) Throughput Evaluation. Next, we are interested in evaluating
the SNR as a function of backscatter bitrate. In particular, since
higher backscatter bitrates occupy a larger bandwidth (while piezo-
electrics have a limited bandwidth), we would like to understand
the impact of bitrate on SNR. We place a battery-free PAB node
in a fixed position, within a meter of both the projector and the
hydrophone. In each experimental trial, we configure its microcon-
troller to backscatter at one of the following bitrates: 100bps, 200bps,
400bps, 600bps, 800bps, 1kbps, 2kbps, 2.8kbps, 3kbps, and 5kbps.
We vary the bitrate at the backscatter node by configuring a different
MCU clock divider,13 and repeat the same experiment three times
for each bitrate. We compute the SNR the same as above.
Fig. 8 plots the average SNR and its standard deviation as a
function of the backscatter bitrate. At the same distance, the SNR
decreases when the bitrate increases. This is because a higher bitrate
requires spreading the transmit power over a wider bandwidth. It is
worth noting that the SNR significantly drops for bitrates higher than
3 kbps, which would result in very high bit error rates. This is partly
because the efficiency of the recto-piezo reduces as the frequency
moves from its resonance.
6.2 Performance vs Distance
Next, we would like to evaluate the distance over which we can
power up a battery-free PAB node. To perform this evaluation against
different multipath environments, we test the powering up range in
both pools. Recall that a PAB node harvests energy from the down-
link acoustic signal transmitted by a projector. So, in this experiment,
we fix the voltage (and hence the power) input of the projector and
measure the maximum range over which it can power the PAB sen-
sor. We repeat the experiment at different transmit voltages and in
both pools. Note that we do not report beyond 5 m for Pool A and
10 m for Pool B since these correspond to the largest range possible
in each of the respective pools.
Fig. 9 plots the maximum distance as a function of the input
voltage to the transducer. The figure shows that in both environments,
the distance increases with the increased input voltage. This can be
explained by the fact that higher voltage leads to higher transmit
power, enabling the battery-free node to harvest energy to power up
even at a longer range. Interestingly, the same transmit power enables
a longer powering up range in Pool B than in the Pool A. This is
likely because Pool B is elongated and acts as a corridor, focusing
the projector’s signal directionally, rather than omnidirectionally as
in Pool A.
13The resolution with which we can vary the bitrate depends on the integer clock divider
available in the MCU.

distance at which the battery-free sensor node can be powered up remotely by the
transmitter as the input voltage to the transmitter increases.

power consumption of the system as it backscatters at different data rates. The system is

• Even though the SINR is relatively low before projection, it is
still greater than zero. This is because even though the concurrent
transmissions interfere, the backscatter node operating at reso-
nance will have a stronger channel than the interfering one (which
is backscattering out-of-band).
• After projecting and inverting the channel, the SINR is signif-
icantly boosted and is greater than 3 dB across the recorded
locations, indicating the ability to decode the transmissions de-
spite interference as per §6.1(a). Moreover, since the capacity of a
