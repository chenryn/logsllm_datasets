User: I am a newbie in Python and has installed MongoDB but each time I try to run mongo.exe from command prompt C:\Program Files\MongoDB 2.6 Standard\bin>mongo.exe, it issues the following:
MongoDB shell version: 2.6.3
connecting to: test
2014-07-15T10:02:02.670+0100 warning: Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1:27017, reas
on: errno:10061 No connection could be made because the target machine actively
refused it.
2014-07-15T10:02:02.672+0100 Error: couldn't connect to server 127.0.0.1:27017 (
127.0.0.1), connection attempt failed at src/mongo/shell/mongo.js:146
exception: connect failed
How can I resolve this? Thank you.
Assistant: You need to make sure you're running mongod in another terminal tab first.
