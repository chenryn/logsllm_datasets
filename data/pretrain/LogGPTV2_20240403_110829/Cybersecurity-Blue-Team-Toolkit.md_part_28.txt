needed and before you roll out those updates to the entire organization,
test those patches on a nonproduction system. If you do not, you take
the risk of breaking something with what should have fixed it. If you
are able to identify issues before a global production rollout, your
operations should not be impacted. Once you know what patches are
missing and which patches are viable, install them on the vulnerable
system. Most of the time, this is done with Windows Update. Most
enterprise‐sized organizations will use some type of patch management
software solution.
Focusing on your most vulnerable systems like those running Windows
operating systems, as well as highly vulnerable third‐party programs
like Adobe Flash, Adobe Reader, and Java, is one of patch management\'s
key concepts. Starting with your most risky yet mission‐critical devices
allows you to allocate time and resources where they will be best
utilized and will provide the most risk mitigation.
[]{#c12.xhtml#Page_168 .pagebreak title="168"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Depending on the size of your organization, how
many people you have on your cybersecurity team, the hours they can
devote to patch management, and how many systems need to be kept
up‐to‐date, you may want to utilize third‐party patch management
software. For Microsoft patching specifically, Microsoft includes a tool
called Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) with all Windows Server
operating systems. WSUS may be sufficient, unless you are using other
third‐party applications like Adobe Flash or Java. There are several
open‐source tools available, but I have used and like the ease of
deploying Desktop Central by ManageEngine.
ManageEngine Desktop Central is web‐based, desktop management software.
It can remotely manage and schedule updates for Windows, Mac, and Linux,
both in local area networks and across wide area networks. In addition
to patch management, software installation, and service pack management,
you can also use it to standardize desktops. You can use it to keep your
images current and synchronized by applying the same wallpapers,
shortcuts, printer settings, and much more.
Desktop Central is free for small businesses and supports one technician
across 25 computers and 25 mobile devices. Its professional and
enterprise versions make it scalable as your business grows. The free
edition still gives you access to all the essential features of the
software, and it is easy to set up.
In [Lab 12.1](#c12.xhtml#c12-fea-0001){#c12.xhtml#R_c12-fea-0001},
you\'ll be installing Desktop Central by ManageEngine.

patch management process begins with the installation of an agent. Once
the agent is downloaded and installed from the Scope of Management (SOM)
page, it will scan the system it is installed on, and you can view the
missing patches. At that point, you can either install patches manually
or automate and schedule the patching process. As you see in [Figure

time between the discovery of a vulnerability and the action an IT
administrator should take to protect the environment from that
vulnerability should be as short as possible, especially on assets that
are mission critical. That philosophy can possibly cause issues where
rapid patch management causes a problem with change management and
quality assurance testing. It will be a balance evaluating the risk of
an unpatched system with the possibly of breaking systems in the process
of fixing it. Creating a patch management program where you document
your strategy for establishing, documenting, and maintaining the changes
is the beginning. The next level in your security maturity model should
be configuration management. You must have a hardened baseline.

## Configuration Management {#c12.xhtml#head-2-91}
In 2010, I was hired for a Department of Defense (DoD) contract to help
deploy the technical assets for the newly formed Air Force Global Strike
Command (AFGSC) with Lt. General Klotz in command. The AFGSC mission was
to manage the U.S. Air Force (USAF) portion of the U.S. nuclear arsenal.
With a newly formed team of 10, the decision was made to split up the
team based on our strengths, and I ended up in the lab with someone who
was to become one of my very best friends, newly retired Master Sergeant
Robert Bills. He is the type of IT guy who does IT for the fun of it.
His call sign in the lab was Crazy Talk because sometimes solving the
problem was so obvious it was crazy.
When we walked into the lab, the process was to take a Windows XP,
Windows Vista, or Windows 7 `.iso` of an operating system, burn it to a
DVD, and image a single machine. After imaging, patching, joining to the
domain, adding the appropriate software, and then forcing group policy
on the system, it could take 7 to 10 days to get just one machine ready
for the end user. Over the next two years, we developed a system using
master images, an old 40‐port Cisco switch, and a whole lot of cable to
scale down the deployment process to about 45 minutes per machine with a
hardened gold image built especially for the division it was intended
for.
Some administrators refer to a golden image as a master image that can
be used to clone and deploy other devices consistently. System cloning
is an effective method of establishing a baseline configuration for your
organization. It requires effort and expertise to establish and maintain
images for deployment. However, the ability to push a tested and secure
system image to your devices can save countless hours per tech refresh.
In fact, our images were so good, the other technicians in other
divisions would take them to the field to reimage machines that were
having issues rather than troubleshoot the problem. It took less time to
image them than to fix them.
[]{#c12.xhtml#Page_174 .pagebreak title="174" role="doc-pagebreak"}To
start this process in your organization, build an inventory of every
server, router, switch, printer, laptop, desktop, and mobile device in
your environment that is going to be connected to the network by using
some of the tools we have already explored. Ideally, the inventory list
should be dynamically and automatically collected. Manually entering an
inventory list into a spreadsheet is not scalable and opens up
opportunities for human error. This should include the location,
hostname, IP address, MAC address, and operating system. For servers,
identifying the function and services running on those systems is also
helpful.
After you have an inventory of systems, you need to configure the image
