https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments#imports says that
`"Imports are organized in groups, with blank lines between them. The standard
library packages are in the first group."`.
However godoc simply sorts imports in lexicographical order.  
This makes it very hard to find the documentation of a standard package.
The order should be:
  1. standard library packages
  2. golang.org/x/ packages
  3. other packages
