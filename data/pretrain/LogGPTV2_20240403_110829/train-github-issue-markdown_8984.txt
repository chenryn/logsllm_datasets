Subject: Request for Multiple Autocomplete and Checkbox Features in Bootstrap

Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to suggest the inclusion of a multiple autocomplete feature, as well as a multiple autocomplete with checkbox component, within the Bootstrap framework. These functionalities would greatly enhance user experience by allowing for more efficient and interactive data input.

For reference, here are two examples that demonstrate the kind of features I am proposing:
- [jQuery UI Multiple Autocomplete](http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#multiple)
- [FCBKcomplete 2](http://www.emposha.com/demo/fcbkcomplete_2/)

I believe these components would be a valuable addition to Bootstrap and would be widely appreciated by developers and end-users alike.

Thank you for considering my suggestion. I look forward to your thoughts on this matter.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
