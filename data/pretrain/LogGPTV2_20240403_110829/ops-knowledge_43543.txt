User: I have written a simple python script that runs as soon as a certain user on my linux system logs in. It ask's for a password... however the problem is they just exit out of the terminal or minimize it and continue using the computer. So basically it is a password authentication script. So what I am curious about is how to make the python script stay up and not let them exit or do anything else until they entered the correct password. Is there some module I need to import or some command that can pause the system functions until my python script is done?
Thanks
I am doing it just out of interest and I know a lot could go wrong but I think it would be a fun thing to do. It can even protect 1 specific system process. I am just curious how to pause the system and make the user do the python script before anything else.
Assistant: There will always be a way for the user to get past your script.
Let's assume for a moment that you actually manage to block the X-server, without blocking input to your program (so the user can still enter the password). The user could just alt-f1 out of the X-server to a console and kill "your weird app". If you manage to block that too he could ssh to the box and kill your app.
There is most certainly no generic way to do something like this; this is what the login commands for the console and the session managers (like gdm) for the graphical display are for: they require a user to enter his password before giving him some form of interactive session. After that, why would you want yet another password to do the same thing? the system is designed to not let users use it without a password (or another form of authentication), but there is no API to let programs block the system whenever they feel like it.
