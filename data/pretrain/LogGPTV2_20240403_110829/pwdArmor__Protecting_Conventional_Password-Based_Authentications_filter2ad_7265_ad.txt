### pwdArmor: Enhancing Security for Password-Based Authentication

#### Overview
pwdArmor is designed to restrict unauthorized users from accessing protected pages and relies on HTTP headers to indicate the availability of pwdArmor logins. It also uses HTTP headers to exchange messages created by libpwdarmor. Upon successful authentication, session cookies are used to maintain the authenticated state with the client.

#### 6.1 Integrating with Existing Protocols
Table 1 provides specific examples of pwdArmor message contents for various password protocols:

- **HTTP Basic with Apache Variant of MD5-based BSD Verifiers**
  - In this protocol, α specifies the method of verifier creation and includes the salt required to recreate the stored verifier.
  - HTTP Basic does not use a host-supplied challenge and expects the user's password (pwdU) to be sent in RU.
  - If an attacker (M) steals the stored verifier (pwdver_U) and tricks the user (U) into attempting an authentication, M can decrypt RU and impersonate U until pwdU is reset.
  - pwdArmor enhances HTTP Basic by providing protections similar to those of an encrypted tunnel, including protection for RU if the tunnel is bypassed.

- **One-Time Password (OTP)**
  - The value of α is equivalent to the challenge from the previous successful authentication, which contains the information needed to derive the current one-time password.
  - If M obtains pwdver_U and tricks U into attempting an authentication, M can decrypt RU and impersonate U once.
  - OTP is vulnerable to "small n" attacks where M reduces the hash index of the real host's challenge. However, even if M manipulates the hash index in α, she will at worst obtain a LEAK break, as pwdver_U is needed to decrypt RU and obtain the "small n" value generated by U.

- **HTTP Basic with HTTP Digest Verifiers**
  - α specifies the algorithm and realm, enabling U to generate the H(A1) HTTP Digest password verifier.
  - HTTP Basic has no host-supplied challenge and expects pwdU.
  - pwdArmor provides the same protection against PWD breaks as HTTP Digest without requiring password-equivalent verifiers.
  - If HTTP Digest is still used elsewhere with the same verifiers, they remain password-equivalent for those authentications.

#### 7 Related Work
- **Encrypted Tunnels (e.g., TLS)**
  - Encrypted tunnels can be circumvented by phishing attacks, making it difficult for users to determine if host authentication occurred and to verify the server's identity.
  - Solutions like visualization techniques [27] and additional human-perceptible server authenticators [12] help improve verification.
  - Systems like BeamAuth [2] use bookmarks to ensure logins occur only with legitimate sites.
  - pwdArmor provides passive/active protections similar to encrypted tunnels, with the added benefit that if host authentication is circumvented, pwdU is not leaked.

- **Delayed Password Disclosure (DPD) [17]**
  - DPD authenticates the host without a secure tunnel by requiring the user to verify a host-supplied image after each character of pwdU is entered.
  - Unlike pwdArmor, DPD thwarts static phishing sites but does not protect against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
  - pwdArmor maintains the current practice of allowing users to quickly submit their usernames and passwords.

- **Compound Authentication Binding Problem [5, 28]**
  - The solution proposed (and adopted by EAP [1]) requires the session key to be derived from the tunnel key and a key created by the inner authentication protocol or from pwdU.
  - Although this binding prevents MITM attacks, the tunnel must be modified, and the password protocol is not protected if the tunnel is incorrectly established.

- **IKEv2 [18]**
  - IKEv2 supports optional binding to EAP, provided the underlying EAP method produces a key.
  - Like EAP, IKEv2 does not provide protections against phishers if the tunnel is incorrectly established.

- **Oppliger et al. [26]**
  - This approach couples a TLS session to a specific authentication through a hardware/software token.
  - Client-side certificates (from the token) are used in the TLS handshake to prevent MITM attacks, not for client authentication.
  - pwdArmor achieves the same goals using nonces for unique sessions and IDH for tight coupling with the encrypted tunnel.

- **Halevi and Krawczyk [13]**
  - This protocol specifies a generic, password-based, encrypted challenge-response protocol and an instantiation that provides mutual authentication and key exchange.
  - Even though pwdU is encrypted with the host's public key, if the phisher successfully performs the certificate trick, the benefits of this protocol are negated.
  - The requirement for the host to have a public key pair may be unreasonable for low-value services.

- **PAKE Protocols**
  - PAKE protocols (e.g., SRP [30], SPEKE [16], EKE [7], PDM [19], SNAPI [24], PAK [23], AuthA [6], AMP [21]) are the strongest answer to date for password-based authentication through encrypted tunnels.
  - If executed correctly, these protocols are not vulnerable to PWD, LEAK, or MITM breaks.
  - pwdArmor provides all these assurances unless the user falls victim to a certificate trick. PAKE protocols offer superior benefits, except for their inability to reuse existing password verifier databases and lack of privacy protection for the user's identity (IDU).

#### 8 Conclusions and Future Work
- **Advantages of pwdArmor**
  - pwdArmor is a more secure alternative to encasing conventional password-based authentication protocols within a server-authenticated, encrypted tunnel.
  - The key benefit is evident when users think they are authenticating to a legitimate service provider but are being phished. In such scenarios, pwdArmor ensures that users' passwords are never disclosed.
  - Unlike other PAKE protocols, pwdArmor can reuse existing verifier databases while maintaining the password-dependent nature of those veriifiers.
  - pwdArmor also offers optional privacy protection for the user's identity during authentication.

- **Deployment and Integration**
  - Operating system utilities (e.g., CardSpace [9]) for managing and using login credentials can unify user authentication across various mediums and represent an attractive avenue for deploying the client-side functionality required by pwdArmor.
  - Combining pwdArmor with SessionLock [3] could eliminate the need for HTTPS for many low-security websites, reducing the performance overhead and caching behavior of TLS.
