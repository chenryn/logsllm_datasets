### Title: BlackHat Asia 2023: Prototype Pollution Leads to RCE â€“ Gadgets Everywhere

**Abstract:**

Many developers are familiar with Prototype Pollution vulnerabilities in JavaScript applications. These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to inject properties into the root prototype of an object, potentially leading to flow control alterations and unexpected program behavior. While some successful exploits may seem like magic or are limited to causing a denial of service (DoS), it might surprise you to learn that many applications contain chains of methods that can be triggered by Prototype Pollution, ultimately leading to arbitrary code execution (RCE). Such "gadgets" are found not only in the core Node.js code but also in popular NPM packages.

However, it's important to note that not every application is vulnerable to exploitation. Nonetheless, the presence of these gadgets significantly increases the risk of such attacks. In our research, we delved deeper into Prototype Pollution beyond DoS and analyzed the Node.js source code for these gadgets. We then examined 15 popular Node.js applications from GitHub, identifying 8 instances where RCE was possible.

During this talk, I will detail the detected gadgets and vulnerabilities, and discuss how recent changes in Node.js have helped mitigate these issues.
