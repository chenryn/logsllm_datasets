Assistant: To use Shell scripts to automatically deploy and configure the Nginx server, follow the steps below: 1. Install Nginx: Use the command apt-get or yum to install Nginx in the Shell script. 2. Configure Nginx: Use the command cp or mv to copy the configuration file nginx.conf to the /etc/nginx/ directory in the Shell script, and enable or disable the default Nginx site. 3. Deploy the site: use mkdir in the shell script to create the site directory, and copy the site files and configuration files to the site directory. 4. Configure an SSL certificate: If you need to deploy an HTTPS site, use the openssl command in the Shell script to generate an SSL certificate and copy it to the Nginx configuration. 5. Start Nginx: Use the command systemctl or service in the Shell script to start the Nginx service. The above are some basic steps to realize the automatic deployment and configuration of the Nginx server. By writing Shell scripts and putting them into the version control system, the rapid automatic deployment and configuration of Nginx can be realized, and the development efficiency and deployment efficiency can be improved.
