To mitigate the risk of file system permissions abuse within an enterprise, it is recommended to utilize auditing tools that can identify and address such vulnerabilities. These tools should be capable of detecting potential weaknesses in file system permissions across all systems in the network. One example of a toolkit that can be used for this purpose is the PowerSploit framework, which includes the PowerUp module. This module can be employed to explore and identify service file system permission weaknesses on various systems.[2]
