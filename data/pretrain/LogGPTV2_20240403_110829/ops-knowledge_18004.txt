User: I have a python script that runs continuously as a WebJob (using Microsoft Azure), it generates some values (heart beat rate) continuously, and I want to display those values in my Web App.
I don't know how to proceed to link the WebJob to the web app.
Any ideas ?
Assistant: You have two main options:
You can have the WebJobs write the values to a database or to Azure Storage (e.g. a queue), and have the Web App read them from there.
Or if the WebJob and App are in the same Web App, you can use the file system. e.g. have the WebJob write things into %home%\data\SomeFolderYouChoose, and have the Web App read from the same place.
