### Task: Setting Up RetroPie

In this procedure, you will download, install, and configure RetroPie on your Raspberry Pi.

1. **Download the RetroPie Image:**
   - On your host computer, visit the petRockBlog website and download the RetroPie Project SD card image from [http://is.gd/BSyKRP](http://is.gd/BSyKRP).
   - Note that the SD image is approximately 1.4GB in size and comes as a ZIP file. You will need to extract the image file before flashing it to an SD card.

2. **Flash the RetroPie Image to the SD Card:**
   - Use your preferred SD card flashing utility (as covered in Chapter 4, "Installing and Configuring an Operating System") to flash the RetroPie image to your SD card.

3. **Connect a Joystick or Gamepad (Optional):**
   - If you have a joystick or gamepad, plug it into your Raspberry Pi now.

4. **Boot the Raspberry Pi:**
   - Insert the newly flashed SD card into your powered-off Raspberry Pi and boot it up.
   - After seeing the RetroPie splash screen, you will be automatically directed to Emulation Station and its text-based wizard to help you configure your joystick or keyboard. Refer to Figure 13.2 for an example of the control mapping screen.

   **Figure 13.2:** Emulation Station starts with a keyboard or joystick control mapping wizard.

   **Note: No Joystick?**
   - If you do not have a joystick, the Emulation Station controller setup wizard will display "No joysticks detected!" In this case, press F4 to exit the controller setup wizard.

5. **Configure Input Actions:**
   - For each input action required by a game, RetroPie will prompt you to press a key on your keyboard or a button on your joystick (refer to Figure 13.2).

6. **Complete the Wizard:**
   - Once you complete the wizard, you will see a "Basic config done!" message. Press any button or keyboard key to enter Emulation Station.

   **Note:**
   - If you made mistakes during the initial controller setup, such as not having enough buttons on your joystick, you can correct these later in this chapter.

### Transferring ROMs to RetroPie

ROMs are essential for retro gaming. If you owned an NES, Atari 2600, or other 80s and 90s game consoles, you know that games were typically packaged in plastic cartridges. A ROM image, or ROM file, is a bit-for-bit copy of the data from the Read Only Memory (ROM) chip in these cartridges.

**Legal Consideration:**
- To legally download a ROM, you must already own the original game cartridge. If you no longer have your old video game collection, there are many online and brick-and-mortar stores that sell used and vintage game cartridges.

**Creating a ROM:**
- If you have legally owned game cartridges, you can create ROM files using dedicated hardware. This process often involves downloading schematics and assembling PCBs. Alternatively, you can download ROMs from trusted sources like AtariAge.com if you own the corresponding game cartridges.

**Transferring ROMs to Your Raspberry Pi:**

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Ensure that you have performed the initial setup of your Raspberry Pi using `sudo raspi-config` as covered in Chapter 4.
   - Update the system software and reboot:
     ```sh
     sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
     sudo reboot
     ```

2. **Enhance Performance (Optional):**
   - Consider adjusting the Pi’s memory split to favor graphics over processor performance and enabling overclocking. These topics are covered in detail in Chapter 18, "Raspberry Pi Overclocking."

3. **Transfer ROMs via SSH:**
   - Raspbian enables Secure Shell (SSH) connections by default. Use a Secure Copy (SCP) utility to transfer ROM files to the Pi.
   - On your Raspberry Pi, if you are in Emulation Station, press F4 to exit to a Terminal prompt. Type `ifconfig eth0` to obtain the Pi’s IP address.
   - On a remote computer, use FileZilla, Cyberduck, or another SFTP client tool to connect to your Pi. Specify SFTP as the connection method. The default username and password are `pi` and `raspberry`, respectively.
   - Navigate to the path `/home/pi/RetroPie/roms` and drag and drop your ROM files into the appropriate subfolders. For example, NES ROMs typically have the `.nes` file extension, while Atari 2600 ROMs usually have the `.bin` extension.

4. **Start Emulation Station:**
   - From the Terminal prompt on your Pi, start Emulation Station with the command:
     ```sh
     emulationstation
     ```

   **Default Games:**
   - By default, Emulation Station includes the following games:
     - Cave Story
     - Doom
     - Duke Nukem 3D (demo)
   - You can also run the LinApple Apple II emulator and the rpix86 DOS 5.0 emulator to play old Apple II games.

### Setting Up Your Controls

Emulation Station is optimized for joystick/gamepad-based control, but you can also edit keyboard mappings.

1. **Edit Keyboard Mappings:**
   - From Emulation Station, press F4 to exit to a Terminal prompt.
   - Edit the `retroarch.cfg` file located at `~/RetroPie/configs/all/retroarch.cfg` using the command:
     ```sh
     sudo nano ~/RetroPie/configs/all/retroarch.cfg
     ```
   - Look for the line that starts with `# Keyboard input` and edit the key mapping values directly.

2. **Configure Joystick Mappings:**
   - Use the `retroarch-joyconfig` utility to customize joystick mappings.
   - From the Terminal prompt, navigate to the appropriate directory:
     ```sh
     cd ~/RetroPie/emulators/RetroArch/tools
     ```
   - Run the following command to redirect the output to the `retroarch.cfg` file:
     ```sh
     ./retroarch-joyconfig >> ~/RetroPie/configs/all/retroarch.cfg
     ```
   - Assign bindings for each command by pressing the appropriate button on your joystick.

3. **Add Exit Emulator Mapping:**
   - Add the following lines to the end of the `retroarch.cfg` file to allow you to exit the active emulator and return to Emulation Station:
     ```sh
     input_enable_hotkey_btn = "X"
     input_exit_emulator_btn="Y"
     ```
   - Replace `X` and `Y` with the appropriate joystick buttons.

### Playing Your Games

1. **Reboot or Start Emulation Station:**
   - Reboot your Raspberry Pi or type `emulationstation` from the Terminal prompt to start Emulation Station.

2. **Navigate and Play:**
   - Use the LEFT and RIGHT controls to scroll through the emulator menus.
   - Use the UP and DOWN controls to scroll through the game menus.
   - Use the ACCEPT and SELECT controls to launch and start games.
   - Use ESC or your custom joystick mapping to exit the emulator and return to Emulation Station.

**Figure 13.7:** This is Super Mario Brothers, one of the most popular video games of all time.

### Installing Useful Add-Ons

You can use media scrapers to enhance your retro gaming experience by adding box art and game descriptions.

1. **Install ES-Scraper:**
   - From the Terminal on your Raspberry Pi, navigate to the appropriate directory:
     ```sh
     cd
     cd RetroPie/supplementary
     ```
   - Create a local copy of the ES-scraper online repository and run the RetroPie setup script:
     ```sh
     git clone http://github.com/elpender/ES-scraper
     cd
     cd RetroPie-Setup
     sudo ./retropie_setup.sh
     ```
   - In the RetroPie Setup utility, select `Setup` and then `Run ‘ES-scraper’`.
   - Select `(Re-)scrape of the ROMs directory` to perform an immediate ROM discovery and metadata download.

**Figure 13.9:** Downloaded box art and game description data make browsing your ROM collection more enjoyable.

### In Search of the Perfect Joystick

RetroPie does an excellent job of detecting USB joysticks and gamepads. Many retro gamers prefer using either a reproduction or original controller from the original consoles. Quality varies widely for USB reproductions, and adapters that transform proprietary controller plugs into USB are often preferred.

**Recommended Controllers:**
- Logitech Rumblepad 2
- Atari 2600
- SNES
- Sega Genesis

**USB Adapters:**
- RetroZone sells USB adapters for various console controllers, including Atari 2600, NES, Nintendo 64, Sega Genesis, and SNES.

**Reproductions:**
- Tomee and Retrolink offer reproductions of old controllers with native USB connectivity.

**GPIO Adapter:**
- The RetroPie Project has developed a GPIO adapter for original SNES controllers. Visit their website for details and assembly instructions.

**Figure 13.11:** The PetRockBlog RetroPie GPIO Adapter includes an extra tactile pushbutton for additional functionality.

### Chapter 14: Raspberry Pi Minecraft Server

Minecraft, a sandbox construction game created by Markus “Notch” Persson and later acquired by Mojang AB, is a cultural phenomenon. The game has no defined storyline, allowing players to explore and build freely. The chunky 8-bit graphics of Minecraft remind many of classic games like Super Mario Brothers and Doom.

**Main Tasks in Minecraft:**
- Mining: Breaking blocks to gather resources.
- Crafting: Using resources to create new items and structures.

This guide will help you set up a Minecraft server on your Raspberry Pi.
