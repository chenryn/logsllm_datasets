Claim 4 (Ideal protocol wins). If Πideal satisﬁes Invariant 1,
Apaths has an advantage of zero:
Pr[b = Apaths | Invariant 1 holds] = 1

We refer to Appendix B for the proofs of Claim 3 and Claim 4.
V. SYNCHRONIZED USERS WITH NON-COMPROMISING
ADVERSARIES
Our ﬁrst scenario is a protocol-friendly user distribution
UB, where inputs from all users are globally synchronized:
over the course of N rounds, exactly one user per round sends
a message, following a random permutation that assigns one
round to each user. Analogously, the protocol globally instructs
the users to send up to β ∈ [0, 1] noise messages per user per
round, or B = βN noise messages per round in total.
life,
In real
the user distribution is independent of the
protocol. However, to make the user distribution protocol-
friendly in our modeling we consider a globally controlled user
distribution. For this scenario, we consider non-compromising
passive adversaries that can observe all network trafﬁc.
A. Lower Bound on Adversarial Advantage
Theorem 1. For user distribution UB, no protocol Π ∈ M
can provide δ-sender anonymity, for any δ  N where the probability is smaller. Thus,
no matter what value of t is returned by O, Pr [H2] ≤ (cid:3)−1
N−1.
Given any values (cid:4), β ≥ 0 , Apaths has the least chance of
winning, if for a given interval of (cid:4) rounds, βN(cid:4) unique users

are picked to send the noise messages in such a way that they
are not scheduled to send their own messages in that interval.
Pr [¬H3] = Pr [¬H1,¬H2] ≥ max(0, (N − (cid:3) − βN(cid:3))/(N − 1)).
Pr [H3] = 1 − Pr [¬H3] ≤ min(1, (((cid:3) + βN(cid:3))/(N − 1))).
Thus, we can bound the probability for the adversary as
P r[0 = Apaths|b = 1] = P r[1 = Apaths|b = 0] = 1
2 Pr [H3];
and P r[0 = Apaths|b = 0] = 1 − 1
2 Pr [H3]. And therefore,
since δ ≥ P r[0 = Apaths|b = 0] − P r[0 = Apaths|b = 1],
δ ≥ 1 − Pr [H3] ≥ 1 − fβ((cid:4)).
B. Impossibility for Strong Anonymity

VI. SYNCHRONIZED USERS WITH PARTIALLY
COMPROMISING ADVERSARIES
We now extend our analysis of the previous section by
having compromised protocol parties. Given the set of protocol
parties P, now our adversary Apaths can compromise a set of
c parties Pc ⊂ P. If Apaths can compromise all the parties
in P, anonymity is broken trivially - that’s why we do not
analyze that case separately. Recall from Section IV-C that
Apaths picks the c parties from P uniformly at random. We
consider the same user distribution UB as in Section V.

By Claim 1 the adversary wins whenever Invariant 1 is not
true, and by Claim 4 Apaths has zero advantage whenever
Πideal satisﬁes the invariant. Hence, we know that the proba-
bility that the adversary guesses incorrectly is bounded by:
Pr [0 = Apaths|b = 1] = Pr [1 = Apaths|b = 0]

2) Case c ≤ (cid:4): The probability that all parties on the
mutual path of the challenge message and a message from the
alternative sender u1−b are compromised now mainly depends
on the arrival time of the messages from u1−b. We ﬁnd two
sub-cases depending on the oracle’s choice for t.

Note that the probability that there are no messages from
u1−b in [(r− (cid:4)), (r− c)] and that there is at least one message
from u1−b in [(r − c), r] are not independent from each other.
The best thing a protocol can do with the noise messages is
to have Nβ(cid:4) unique users, different from the (cid:4) users who send
their actual message, send the noise messages. Thus, if a user
sends a message in [(r−(cid:4)), (r−c)], he can not send a message
in [(r−c), r]. The above calculations are done considering that
best scenario. Also note that the value of K may be larger or
smaller than (cid:4) and t, but as long as c ≤ K, the bound given
above holds. Hence, δ ≥ 1 − fβ((cid:3) − c) − [1 − 1/
