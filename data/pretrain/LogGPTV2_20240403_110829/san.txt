### Description:
The `san` command is used to display or set the Storage Area Network (SAN) policy for the operating system. If no parameters are specified, the current SAN policy will be displayed.

### Syntax:
```plaintext
san [policy={onlineAll | offlineAll | offlineShared}] [noerr]
```

### Parameters:

- **policy={onlineAll|offlineAll|offlineShared}**
  - **onlineAll**: Specifies that all newly discovered disks are brought online and made read/write. **Important:** Setting this policy on a server that shares disks could lead to data corruption. Therefore, you should not set this policy if disks are shared among servers unless the server is part of a cluster.
  - **offlineAll**: Specifies that all newly discovered disks, except the startup disk, are kept offline and read-only by default.
  - **offlineShared**: Specifies that all newly discovered disks that do not reside on a shared bus (such as SCSI and iSCSI) are brought online and made read/write. Disks that are left offline are read-only by default.

- **noerr**
  - Used for scripting only. When an error is encountered, DiskPart continues to process commands as if the error did not occur. Without this parameter, an error causes DiskPart to exit with an error code.

### Examples:

- **To view the current policy:**
  ```plaintext
  san
  ```

- **To make all newly discovered disks, except the startup disk, offline and read-only by default:**
  ```plaintext
  san policy=offlineAll
  ```
