extension for representative values of the power α and request-
rates. The simulations show the general patterns that were
analytically revealed for Poisson arrivals. As with Poisson
arrivals, for each ﬁxed α, the pattern was more pronounced
for higher request-rates.
7.2 Trace-based simulations
We simulate the performance of our cache with diﬀerent
extension factors and under the diﬀerent source types. The
source simulations are as outlined in Section 4. To incorpo-
rate extension factor of r, our simulated cache computes the
freshness lifetime to be r times its calculated value for the
respective source type.
Figure 13 shows the miss rate for diﬀerent request-rates
as a function of the extension factor for the various source-
types. Very similar results were obtained for the SD trace
(not shown). As predicted by the analysis, the auth(r) and
ind(r) performance curves are smooth whereas the exc(r)
performance curve has sharper drops at integral values of r.
This behavior is more pronounced for higher request rates.
It is also evident that for integral values of r, exc(r) out-
performs ind(r) and for some intermediate values ind(r)
outperforms exc(r).
7.3 Lessons and implications
The patterns derived from the Poisson analysis and the
Pareto and trace-based simulations provide guidelines for
an eﬀective use of extension.
Extension factor selection can vary with object and with
time, as to obtain a better balance of the degree of inco-
herence and the cost of cache misses. Let us assume that
for a particular object, the degree of incoherence is the av-
erage value of the extension factor r, and the miss-cost is
proportional to the number of misses. We now ask, given
maximum allowed incoherence, how to select extension fac-
tors as to minimize the miss-cost.
Interestingly, for this
objective, we obtain opposite guidelines when using an exc
source than when using ind or auth sources.
• The form of the miss rate vs. extension tradeoﬀ curve
of exc(r) implies that across all request rates, integral
values of r provide the best tradeoﬀ of incoherence and
miss-rate. In particular, a mix of consecutive integral
values of the extension factor incurs lower miss-cost
than a non-integral extension factor with the same de-
gree of incoherence. (A mix of exc(1) and exc(2) with
the same incoherence as exc(1.5) has lower cost.) The
beneﬁt of using integral values depends on the per-
formance gaps, which are more pronounced for higher
request rates.
• With ind and auth sources, the dependence of miss-
rate on the extension factor is convex, and monotone
decreasing as r increases. Thus, a ﬁxed value of r
would result in lower miss-rate than a mix of values
with the same average degree of incoherence.
8. CONCLUSION
We explored age as a new facet of cache performance
which aﬀects cascaded caches. Age is complementary to
other cache-performance issues: it aﬀects frequently-requested
objects, and prevails even with inﬁnite storage. Surpris-
ingly, age-related performance issues had been by and large
overlooked. We used analysis and simulations to evaluate
performance aspects of age under various cache conﬁgura-
tions and behaviors.
In particular, we studied extended
object-lifetime durations at client caches, sporadic pre-term
refreshes, and rejuvenation at high-level caches.
To focus on age issues, our analysis factored-out other
well-studied and better-understood performance facets, such
as misses incurred at higher-level caches. For future work,
it would be interesting to study tradeoﬀs between various
performance facets and their combined behavior.
