Apparently this works well in practice and it's pretty robust and can work on
heterogeneous columns.  
The idea is to univariately sample from the training set. The obvious downside
is that you have to store the training set.  
For few unique values we could store the counts, but that would require
separately treating those with few unique values and standard continuous.  
Though for the continuous case we could also use binning to get around storing
the training set.... hm...
