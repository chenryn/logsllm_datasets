domly in other speech. Therefore, as the length
of the phrase increases, the number of false posi-
tives from the search HMM decreases and the de-
tector’s precision increases. Our detector achieves
its best results on phrases that are at least 3 seconds
in length.
The most important factor in determining our
detector’s recall was not one which we initially an-
ticipated. It appears that there are some speakers
in the dataset whom we can recognize with great
accuracy, and some with whom we have more difﬁ-
culty. Our technique for synthesizing training data
for the proﬁle HMM does not seem to accurately
predict the way everyone speaks. To see the vari-
ability in our performance across the 168 speakers
in the test set, we computed the attacker’s true pos-
itive rate for each speaker s in the test set, as the
fraction of utterances from s that our algorithm de-
tects. The median true positive rate for speakers is
63%, and for about 20% of the speakers the true
positive rate is below 50%. When a phrase happens
to be spoken by several users for whom our synthe-
sis techniques do not work well, our true positive
rate for the phrase suffers as well. This impacts
both precision and recall, because the true positive
rate factors strongly in both measures.
Techniques for Mitigation One way to prevent
word spotting would be to pad packets to a com-
mon length, or at least to coarser granularity. To ex-
plore the tradeoff between padding and search ac-
curacy, we encrypted both our training and testing
data sets to multiples of 128, 256 or 512 bits and
applied our approach. The results are presented in
Figure 12. The use of padding is quite encourag-
ing as a mitigation technique, as it greatly reduced
the overall accuracy of the search algorithm. When
padding to multiples of 128 bits, we achieve only
0.15 recall at 0.16 precision.
Increasing padding
so that packets are multiples of 256 bits gives a re-
call of .04 at .04 precision. That said, padding to
128, 256, and 512 bit blocks results in overheads
of 8.81%, 16.5%, and 30.82%, respectively. These
bandwidth estimates are likely lower than the over-
head incurred in practice, because as Chu notes [4],
in a two-way call each participant is idle 63% of the
time, which would allow the transmission of many
smaller packets. However, our testing is comprised
of continuous speech, and so the smaller packets
that indicate silence are less prevalent.

5 Related Work
In 1982, Simmons and Holdridge [29] high-
lighted the shortcomings of an early design for en-
crypting voice trafﬁc using a semantically-insecure
version of RSA. They showed that an adversary
with knowledge of the recipient’s public key could
recover the audio from an encrypted conversation
by pre-computing ciphertexts for a moderate num-
ber of sounds and then observing when the same
ciphertexts were transmitted.
More recently, the increasing popularity of In-
ternet telephony has encouraged several studies of
VoIP and security. Wang et al. [39] proposed a
method of tracking VoIP calls across anonymizing
networks, like ToR [6], through the use of packet
timing as a watermark. Verscheure et al. [36] then
presented an entirely passive method for identify-
ing the endpoints of an anonymized VoIP call by
observing patterns in the packet stream due to the
encoder’s voice activity detection. Work by Pelaez-
Moreno et al. [18] and Aggarwal et al. [1] has ex-
amined the problem of speech recognition from
compressed VoIP. Finally, we have shown in ear-
lier work that it is possible to identify the language
spoken by the callers in a VoIP conversation using
only the sizes of the encrypted packets [41].
Additionally, there is a growing body of work
focusing on inference of sensitive information from
encrypted network connections using packet sizes
and timing information. Sun et al. [32] have shown
that it is possible to identify web pages travers-
ing encrypted HTTP connections (e.g., SSL) using
only the number and size of the encrypted HTTP
responses. More recently, Saponas et al. [26] pro-
posed a method to identify videos played over an
encrypted network channel using the total size of
the packets transmitted in a short window of time.
Packet inter-arrival times have been used to infer
keystrokes within encrypted SSH sessions [31].
The techniques presented in this paper are heav-
ily inﬂuenced by the speech recognition commu-
nity and its established methods for wordspotting.
The most widely accepted method of wordspot-
ting in continuous speech data takes advantage of
hidden Markov models (HMMs) trained on acous-
tic features of complete words (e.g., [22, 40]), or
the composition of phonemes into words (e.g., [21,
23]). For HMMs trained on whole-word acoustic
data, detection rates can reach upwards of 95%, but
such approaches are inherently limited to relatively
small vocabularies where there is an abundance of
training data available for each word. On the other
hand, phonetically-trained acoustic HMMs are able
to spot any word based solely on its phonetic tran-
scription and acoustic data for the phonemes. How-
ever, detection rates for these phoneme-based sys-
tems tend to fall to between 75% and 85% due
to the difﬁculty of capturing word-speciﬁc pro-
nunciation variability. At a high level, our VoIP
phrase spotting technique uses phonetically-trained
HMMs, but the speciﬁcs of their use are drastically
different from that of typical speech since we do not
have access to the underlying acoustic data. De-
spite the coarse nature of the information gained
from encrypted VoIP packet sizes, the performance
of our approach is not signiﬁcantly worse than that
of early wordspotting methods in speech.
6 Conclusion
Previous work has shown that combining VBR
compression with length-preserving encryption
leaks information about VoIP conversations [41].
In this paper, we show that this information leak-
age is far worse than originally thought. Our re-

sults indicate that a proﬁle hidden Markov model
trained using speaker- and phrase-independent data
can detect the presence of some phrases within en-
crypted VoIP calls with recall and precision exceed-
ing 90%. On average, our method achieves recall of
50% and precision of 51% for a wide variety pho-
netically rich phrases spoken by a diverse collec-
tion of speakers. Moreover, we examine the impact
of noise, dictionary size, and word variation on the
performance of our techniques.
The results of our study show that an attacker
can spot a variety of phrases in a number of real-
istic settings, and underscores the danger in using
the default encryption transforms of the SRTP pro-
tocol – none of which specify the use of padding
[2]. Although padding could introduce inefﬁcien-
cies into real-time protocols, our analysis indicates
that it offers signiﬁcant conﬁdentiality beneﬁts for
VoIP calls. An important direction of future work
focuses on the development of padding techniques
that provide an appropriate balance between efﬁ-
ciency and security.
