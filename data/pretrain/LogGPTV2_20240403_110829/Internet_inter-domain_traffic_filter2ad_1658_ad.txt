By 2009, only 25 ports and protocols accounted for 60% of inter-domain traffic. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) data indicates a trend toward the consolidation of Internet application traffic into a smaller set of application ports and protocols.

A specific example of this migration is the shift in video traffic, which will be discussed later in this section and illustrated in Figure 6. Another notable example is the popular Xbox Live service. On June 16, 2009, Microsoft transitioned all Xbox Live traffic, originally using TCP/UDP port 3074, to use port 80 in a minor system update [35, 6].

Conversations with network operators suggest that the consolidation of application ports and protocols, as shown in Figure 5, is driven by two main factors: the increasing dominance of web browsers as the primary application front end, and the efforts of content owners and developers to mitigate the deployment challenges posed by widespread network-layer security policies. Specifically, most deployed firewalls allow HTTP traffic by default, whereas less common applications may require additional configuration, such as port forwarding or explicit pass rules.

### 4.2.1 Applications Exhibiting Growth

Next, we examine the application categories that have seen growth in their share of inter-domain traffic. We start with the fastest-growing category: the web. As previously discussed, web protocols account for a weighted average of 52% of all inter-domain traffic as of July 2009.

Table 4a shows that well-known web ports (i.e., TCP 80, 443, and 8080) gained 10 percentage points between July 2007 and July 2009. Discussions with providers and analysis of payload-based classification data suggest that much of this growth in web traffic, particularly HTTP, is due to video content.

Video represents both the second largest and second fastest-growing application class. Table 4a shows a 1.05 percentage point increase in video protocols (i.e., Flash, RTSP, RTP, and RTCP) between July 2007 and July 2009. By the end of the study period, these video protocols accounted for a 2.64% weighted average of all inter-domain traffic. This growth corresponds to the documented rise in the popularity of internet-based movie and television applications, including Hulu, YouTube, Veoh, and the BBCâ€™s iPlayer [20]. Additionally, payload-based classification data suggests that up to 10% of HTTP traffic in Table 4a may be attributed to progressive HTTP downloads, such as those used by YouTube.

Figure 6 illustrates the growth in video protocols, showing the weighted average percentage of inter-domain traffic contributed by Flash and RTSP over the two-year study period. Flash grew from 0.5% to 3.5%, representing more than a 600% increase. Conversely, RTSP declined by 0.05% during the same period.

Discussions with network operators indicate that much of the RTSP traffic has migrated to Flash and HTTP, which offer more widely supported and simpler alternatives. However, many Internet IPTV offerings still use RTSP internally.

Figure 6 also highlights a spike in Flash traffic on January 20, 2009, corresponding to the Obama inauguration. On that day, Flash traffic reached a weighted average of more than 4% of all inter-domain traffic. Similarly, the Tiger Woods US Open playoff generated a significant but localized spike in North American traffic in June 2008 [37], which did not appear in the global analysis.

During our study period, VPN and game protocols also showed small percentage point growth, increasing by 0.38 and 0.12 percentage points, respectively. Notably, the top three game protocols contributed more than half a percent of all inter-domain traffic as of June 2009.

### 4.2.2 Applications Exhibiting Decline

Excluding Web, Video, VPN, and Games, all other application groups in Table 4 saw a decline in their weighted average percentage of inter-domain traffic. We focus on the most prominent declining category: P2P.

As a category, P2P saw the largest decline, with a drop of 2.8 percentage points between July 2007 and July 2009. Given the provider and regulatory concerns over P2P traffic in 2007 [38], any change in relative P2P volumes has significant implications for traffic management, regulation, and research.

Figure 7 breaks down the average percentage of inter-domain traffic using P2P well-known ports by geographic region. All four regions (South America, North America, Asia, and Europe) show significant declines in P2P traffic over the two-year study period. South America experienced the largest decrease, dropping from an average of 2.5% of inter-domain traffic to under half a percent.

Payload analysis from inline/portspan commercial ISP deployments confirms this trend. In July 2007, P2P traffic accounted for 40% of all traffic in five consumer deployments. By the end of the study period, P2P traffic had decreased to less than 20% of all traffic. These results align with related research findings and press observations of P2P decline [18, 39, 40, 41].

Discussions with Internet providers and a review of research literature and press articles suggest several possible explanations for the decline in P2P, including improvements in P2P client and algorithm efficiency [42], the use of stealthier P2P clients and algorithms (i.e., evasion of payload application classification), migration to tunneled overlays (i.e., IPv6), provider traffic management policies, and increased use of P2P encryption. However, our payload inline/port span dataset does not show any significant growth in encrypted traffic.

Private discussions with network operators suggest that a significant portion of P2P traffic may have shifted to alternative distribution methods, such as direct download and streaming video [40]. These alternatives may avoid many of the issues associated with P2P, including ISP traffic management, poor seeding of torrents, and the threat of litigation over the exchange of copyrighted materials [43].

Examples of direct download sites include MegaUpload, RapidShare, and Mediafire [44, 43]. Similarly, video commercial sites like Hulu, YouTube, Veoh, and MegaVideo provide streaming access to thousands of popular movies and TV shows.
