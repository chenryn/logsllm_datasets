By 2009, only 25 ports / protocols contributed 60% of inter-
domain traÔ¨Éc. Overall the CDF data suggests a migration
of Internet application traÔ¨Éc to a smaller set of application
ports and protocols.
We show a speciÔ¨Åc example of video migration later in
this Section and Figure 6. The popular Xbox Live service
provides another example. On June 16, 2009, we found Mi-
crosoft migrated all Xbox Live (originally TCP / UDP port
3074) traÔ¨Éc to use port 80 in a minor system update [35,
6].
Discussion with network operators suggests the consoli-
dation of application port and protocols in Figure 5 is due
both to the growing dominance of the browser as an appli-
cation front end and the eÔ¨Äorts of content owners / devel-
opers to redress the deployment burdens introduced by near
ubiquitous network layer security policies. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the
majority of deployed Ô¨Årewalls will pass HTTP by default but
less commonly used applications may require conÔ¨Åguration
changes such as port forwarding or explicit pass rules.
4.2.1 Applications Exhibiting Growth
We next look at the application categories with growth in
inter-domain traÔ¨Éc share. We begin with the fastest grow-
ing application category, the web. As discussed earlier in
this Section, web protocols account for a weighted average
52% of all inter-domain traÔ¨Éc as of July 2009.
Table 4a shows that well-known Web ports (i.e., TCP 80,
443 and 8080) gained 10 percentage points between July
2007 and 2009. Discussions with providers and analysis of
the data from payload based classiÔ¨Åcation of applications
suggests much of the Web (and particularly HTTP) growth
is due to video.
As a category, video represents both the second largest
and second fastest growing application class. Table 4a shows
a 1.05% growth in video protocol (i.e., Flash, RTSP, RTP,
and RTCP) percentage points between July 2007 and July
2009. At the end of the study period, these video protocols
represented a 2.64% weighted average of all inter-domain

traÔ¨Éc. This growth in video corresponds to a widely doc-
umented increase in the popularity of Internet-based movie
and television-based applications, including Hulu, YouTube,
Veoh, and the BBC‚Äôs iPlayer [20]. Further, data from pay-
load based classiÔ¨Åcation suggests up to 10% of HTTP traÔ¨Éc
in Table 4a may be due to progressive HTTP download (e.g.,
YouTube).
We show a graph of the growth in video protocols in Fig-
ure 6. The graph shows the weighted average percentage
of inter-domain traÔ¨Éc contributed by Flash and RTSP over
the two year period of our study. Flash grew from .5% to
3.5% in two years, or more than 600% growth. Conversely,
RTSP declined by .05% during the same period.
Discussions with network operators suggests most of the
RTSP traÔ¨Éc migrated to Flash and HTTP. These two pro-
tocols oÔ¨Äer both more widely supported and simpler alterna-
tives to RTSP. We note that many Internet IPTV oÔ¨Äerings
still use RTSP internally.
We also note the spike of Flash traÔ¨Éc in Figure 6 corre-
sponding to the Obama inauguration on January 20, 2009
[36]. Over the day of the inauguration, Flash traÔ¨Éc climbed
to a weighted average of more than 4% of all inter-domain
traÔ¨Éc. While the Tiger Woods US Open playoÔ¨Ä generated

a spike in North American traÔ¨Éc in June 2008 [37], this
spike does not appear in the global analysis as it was largely
localized to the US.
As categories, VPN and game well-known ports / proto-
cols also exhibit small percentage point growth during our
study period, growing at 0.38 and 0.12 percentage points,
respectively. We observe that the top three game proto-
cols contribute more than a half percent of all inter-domain
traÔ¨Éc as of June 2009.
4.2.2 Applications Exhibiting Decline
Excluding Web, Video, VPN and Games, all other appli-
cation groups in Table 4 saw a decline in weighted average
percentage of all inter-domain traÔ¨Éc during our study pe-
riod. We focus on the most prominent application category
exhibiting decline, P2P.
As a category, P2P saw the largest decline with a drop of
2.8% percentage points between July 2007 and July 2009.
Given the provider and regulatory concern over P2P traÔ¨Éc
in 2007 [38], any change in relative P2P volumes has signif-
icant provider traÔ¨Éc management, regulatory and research
implications.
Figure 7 breaks down average percentage of inter-domain
traÔ¨Éc using P2P well-known ports by geographic region.
All four regions (South America, North America, Asia and
Europe) show signiÔ¨Åcant declines in P2P over the two year
study period. South America exhibits the largest decrease
dropping from an average of 2.5% of inter-domain traÔ¨Éc to
under a half percent.
Analysis of P2P traÔ¨Éc using payload analysis from in-
line / portspan commercial ISP deployments shows a similar
trend. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, in July 2007 application payload analysis
of the Ô¨Åve consumer deployments shows P2P percentages at
40% of all traÔ¨Éc. At the end of the study period, applica-
tion payload analysis of these deployments found P2P traÔ¨Éc
percentages at less than 20% of all traÔ¨Éc. Our results mir-
ror related research Ô¨Åndings and press observations of P2P
decline [18, 39, 40, 41].
Discussions with Internet providers and a survey of re-
search literature and press articles suggests several possi-
ble explanations for the decline in P2P, including: improve-
ments in P2P client and algorithm eÔ¨Éciency [42], stealth-
ier P2P clients and algorithms (i.e., evasion of payload
application classiÔ¨Åcation), migration to tunneled overlays
(i.e., IPv6), provider traÔ¨Éc management policies and the
increased use of P2P encryption. We note, however, that
our payload inline / port span dataset does not show any
signiÔ¨Åcant growth in encrypted traÔ¨Éc.
Private discussions with network operators suggest signif-
icant volumes of P2P traÔ¨Éc may have migrated to other
distribution alternatives,
including direct download and
streaming video [40]. These distribution alternatives may
avoid many of the problems associated with P2P such as
ISP traÔ¨Éc management, poor seeding of torrents and the
threat of litigation over the exchange of copyrighted mate-
rials [43].
Direct download sites examples include MegaUpload,
RapidShare, and MediaÔ¨Åre [44, 43]. Similarly, video com-
mercial sites like Hulu, YouTube, Veoh, and MegaVideo pro-
vide streaming access to thousands of popular movies and
