Assistant: This log chunk shows multiple connections from the same IP address (211.72.151.162) to the ftpd software component at the same time (Mon Jul 18 03:26:49 2005). It also shows unsuccessful authentication attempts from the same IP address (211-76-104-65.ebix.net.tw) to the sshd software component. Additionally, two successful user sessions were opened and closed for users cyrus and news. Lastly, an alert was triggered by the logrotate component.
