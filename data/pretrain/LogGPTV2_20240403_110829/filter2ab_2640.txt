**Title: Botconf 2018 - WebAssembly (WASM) Security Analysis and Reverse Engineering**

**Abstract:**

WebAssembly (WASM) is a cutting-edge technology designed for the web, aimed at defining a portable, size- and load-time-efficient binary format. This format serves as a compilation target, enabling code to execute at near-native speed by leveraging common hardware capabilities across a wide range of platforms, including mobile and IoT devices.

In this presentation, we will provide a concise introduction to WebAssembly, followed by an in-depth analysis of WASM binaries, both with and without access to the source code. We will also delve into the security implications of using WebAssembly, particularly in the context of botnets. Our discussion will highlight potential vulnerabilities and explore how malicious actors might exploit these to deploy and manage botnets.
