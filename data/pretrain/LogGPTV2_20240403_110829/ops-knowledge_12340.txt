User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Auto Reconnect VPN on Disconnection due to any reason - Persistent VPN On windows server 2008,2012 or above I need to re-connect VPN automatically once it is disconnected due to any reason.

It may be server restart, Manual command to Disconnect. Persistent VPN connection.

Any work arounds

Assistant: I sort it out using "Task Scheduler"

Here are steps to do it


Make VPN Connection and give it Some Name Let say "My VPN"
Open "Task Scheduler" from Start Menu and click "Create Task" (Option can be found on right side of Task Scheduler)
POPUP will appear asking for Task Information. Fill in information like below 
After that go to Trigger Tab and Select "New". Another POPup will appear like below  
On Top Select "Begin The Task" Drop Down Menu and choose "On an Event"
Below List will change In "Log:" Choose "Application", In "Source:" choose "RasClient", In "EventID:" choose "20226" and then click OK like below

Again click on "New" and add another Trigger. On Top again Select "Begin The Task" Drop Down Menu and choose "On an Event" then In "Log:" Choose "Microsoft-Windows-NetworkProfile/Operational", In "Source:" choose "NetworkProfile", In "EventID:" choose "10000" and then click OK like below

This will add two triggers for our Tasks. like below 
Now we will Add action. Click on Next Tab named "Action" and then Click New, Another Popup will appear. In "Action:" it should be Start a Program then In "Program/Script:" Click Browse and Choose rasdial.exe Its path will appear as it is present inside "System32" folder.Now you need to add name of VPN and credentials in "Add arguments (optional)" in following order 

"VPN Name" username password
Now click OK and Create Task It will appear Tasks List. Now go to VPN Connection Disconnect it and you will see it reconnects automatically. Restart the server and you will see VPN Connected By Default.
