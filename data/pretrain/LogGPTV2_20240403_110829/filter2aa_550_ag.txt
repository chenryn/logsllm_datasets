make sure that the system is working properly, but that may not always be practical 
or even possible.
OpenNet Initiative researchers claim that blocked sites include material related to 
religion, health, education, humor, entertainment, general reference works, com-
puter hacking, and political activism. But Saudi authorities argue that their system 
has safeguards against both over- and under-censorship. KACST provides forms for 
users to request additions to and removals from the blacklist, and they say hundreds 
of requests are received each day asking for new sites to be banned, of which about 
half are subsequently blacklisted. Thus, based on user feedback, around 7,000 sites 
a month are added to the list. Over 100 requests to unblock sites also arrive each 
day, many based on a belief that the system has mischaracterized certain web con-
tent, but no statistics were offered regarding how many are unblocked.147

BIRTH OF A CONCEPT: STRATEGIC CYBER SECURITY
On balance, pornography is easier to censor than politics. Vulgar words can simply 
be removed from network traffic, but software cannot readily determine whether 
political keywords are used in a positive or negative way by an author. Furthermore, 
foreign computer technicians are also of little help since the author’s intention may 
have been positive feedback, constructive criticism, humor, irony, sarcasm, or satire. 
A proper evaluation requires subject matter experts who are fluent in the local lan-
guage, a naturally expensive and time-consuming undertaking.
The problem for censors is that users who are intent on obtaining forbidden in-
formation often find a way to get it. And Saudi citizens are no different. Some ac-
cess the Internet simply by finding computer terminals they assume are not being 
monitored.148 Others make expensive telephone calls to unrestricted foreign ISPs.149 
Increasingly, Saudi citizens have acquired direct-to-satellite Internet access, with 
dishes small enough to fit discreetly on a balcony or rooftop.150
Blocked websites “mirror” their content on known accessible sites, or users forward 
the forbidden content by email as an attached file.151
There are many ways to send email that offer an increased level of security, and all 
of them have been used in Saudi Arabia. Many webmail services are free and do not 
require users to register with a real name.152 “Remail” services attempt to remove all 
identifying user information, try not to keep log files of their activity, and route their 
encrypted email through other remailers before reaching its destination. A govern-
ment censor typically only knows that a user has visited a remailer site, but cannot 
obtain a copy of the message or know its recipient.153
Cutting edge peer-to-peer networking presents another major challenge to Internet 
censors. It employs virtual private networking (VPN) technology in an attempt to 
make file-sharing between computer users invisible to firewalls and content-filtering 
systems such as that used in Saudi Arabia.154
Saudi Web surfers have often made use of anonymous proxy servers,155 which make 
web requests on a user’s behalf, by substituting their own IP for that of the user. 
Unwanted tracking software, such as a browser “cookie,” is also disabled in the pro-

cess. APS IPs are of course blocked by KACST,156 but such services try to make such 
blocking as difficult as possible.157
Today, strong encryption, such as Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), is both reliable and 
cheap. PGP’s design, which couples a sophisticated encryption algorithm with a se-
cret passphrase, works so well that it has come to play an important role in provid-
ing privacy to individual web users around the world. As a result, many countries, 
including Saudi Arabia, disallow its use.158
Information on computer hacking, which can give ordinary citizens an upper hand 
in figuring out how to beat censorship, is often banned.159 But no specific tools can 
be recommended because none of them is perfect.160
New software tools are frequently released, some of which are specifically designed 
to support anti-censorship movements. Psiphon, for example, is easy to use and 
difficult for governments to discover. It works like this: a computer user in an un-
censored country installs Psiphon on his or her computer and then allows a user in 
a censored country to open an encrypted connection through their computer to the 
Internet. Connection information, including a username and password, is passed by 
telephone, posted mail, or human contact.
In summary, network communications are highly vulnerable to surveillance, espe-
cially when all traffic flows through one state-owned system. The Saudi national 
firewall has been successful in keeping ordinary users from visiting many anti-
Muslim or anti-Saudi websites. However, it is extremely difficult for any govern-
ment to prevent those who are willing to accept the risk of arrest from conducting 
prohibited activities.
In the long run, large-scale Internet control may be doomed to failure. Censorship 
tends to inhibit economic development, and governments are often simply too far 
behind the technology curve. New websites appear every minute, and any one of 
them – or all of them – are potentially hostile. Saudi officials publicly acknowledge 
that it is hard to keep up.161
This chapter sought to demonstrate that managing Internet security is highly prob-
lematic, even for a willing and well-resourced government. But from a strategic secu-
rity perspective, there are concerns that lie above and beyond political criticism and

pornography: to wit, the protection of national critical infrastructures. Are they safe 
from cyber attack? This is the topic of the next chapter, which examines a hypotheti-
cal cyber terrorist attack against an electricity plant.
Modeling Cyber Attack and Defense in a Laboratory
Many national security thinkers fear that the age of cyber terrorism and cyber war-
fare is coming soon. And the target list seems to grow by the day: electricity,162 
water, air traffic control, stock exchange,163 national elections,164 and more. However, 
the extent to which cyber attacks pose a true threat to national security is unclear. 
Expert opinions range from dismissive165 to apocalyptic.166
We do know that there are worrisome trends in information technology (IT). Nation-
al critical infrastructures are increasingly connected to the Internet. At the same 
time, their custom IT systems, some created in the 1950s and 1960s, are now being 
replaced with less expensive, off-the-shelf and Internet-enabled Windows and UNIX 
systems that are not only easier to use but easier to hack. The older systems were 
relatively more secure because they were not well-understood by outsiders and be-
cause they had minimal network contact with other computer systems.167
National security planners require a better understanding of the threat posed by cy-
ber attacks as soon as possible. Some real-world case studies exist.168 However, much 
information lies outside the public domain. Furthermore, there have been no wars 
yet between two Internet-enabled militaries, and the ignorance of many organiza-
tions regarding the state of their own cyber security is alarming. Looking toward 
the future, military planners must be able to simulate cyber attacks and test cyber 
162 “Remarks by the President...” 2009; “Cyber War...” 2009: The threat to electricity encompasses 
everything that relies on electricity to function, including computer systems. In May 2009, President 
Obama stated that “cyber attacks have plunged entire cities into darkness,” reportedly referencing 
large scale, anonymous attacks in Brazil.
163 Wagner, 2010: In May 2010, after the Dow Jones surprisingly plunged almost 1,000 points, White 
House adviser John Brennan stated that officials had considered but found no evidence of a malicious 
cyber attack.
164 Orr, 2007: In 2007, California held a hearing for election officials on the subject of whether 
hackers could subvert the integrity of the state’s touch-screen voting machines. While the system 
manufacturer disputed the validity of the tests, the Red Team leader testified that the voting system 
was vulnerable to numerous attacks that could be carried out quickly.

Level” Editor Kevin Poulsen, and Foreign Policy editor Evgeny Morozov.
166 Bliss, 2010: In early 2010, former U.S. Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell testified 
that the U.S. would “lose” a cyber war today, and that it will probably take a “catastrophic event” 
before needed security measures are undertaken to secure the Internet.

defenses within the bounds of a safe laboratory environment, without threatening 
the integrity of operational networks.169
The need for cyber defense exercises (CDX) is clear. But the complex and ever-
changing nature of IT and computer hacking makes conducting a realistic CDX an 
enormous challenge and may render its conclusions valid only for a short period of 
time. The world is experiencing a rapid proliferation of computing devices, process-
ing power, user-friendly hacker tools, practical encryption, and Web-enabled intel-
ligence collection.170 At the same time, a CDX requires the simulation of not only 
adversary and friendly forces, but even the battlefield itself.
Of course, the military is no stranger to computers. Software is now used to train 
tank drivers and pilots; it is also used to simulate battles, campaigns, and even com-
plex geopolitical scenarios. But it remains controversial how closely a computer sim-
ulation can model the complexity of the real world. Myriad factors can contribute to 
failure – poor intelligence, incorrect assumptions, miscalculations, a flawed scoring 
system, and even political considerations. In 2002, the U.S. military spent $250 
million on a war game called Millennium Challenge, which was designed to model 
an invasion of Iraq. In the middle of the exercise, the Red Team (RT) leader, Marine 
Corps Lt. Gen. Paul Van Riper, quit the game on the grounds that it had been rigged 
to ensure a Blue Team (BT) victory.171
This chapter covers the origin and evolution of CDXs, and it describes the design, 
goals, and lessons learned from a recent “live-fire” international CDX, the May 2010 
Baltic Cyber Shield (BCS). BCS was managed at the Cooperative Cyber Defence Cen-
tre of Excellence (CCD CoE) in Tallinn, Estonia. Its virtual battlefield was designed 
and hosted by the Swedish Defence Research Agency (FOI) in Linköping, Sweden 
with the support of the Swedish National Defence College (SNDC).172 Over 100 par-
ticipants hailed from across northern Europe.
A robust CDX requires a team-oriented approach. There are friendly forces (Blue), 
hostile forces (Red), technical infrastructure (Green), and game management 
(White). The RT and BTs are the CDX combatants. The Green Team (GT) and White 
Team (WT) are non-combatants; RT attacks against either in most CDXs are strictly 
prohibited.
169 Occasionally, “penetration tests” are conducted against operational networks, but extreme care is 
always taken to avoid a real-life denial-of-service and/or the loss of sensitive data.
170 In the Internet age, Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) collection, against both people and 
organizations, is easier and more powerful than ever.
171 Gomes, 2003.
172 Estonian Cyber Defence League, Finnish Clarified Networks, NATO Computer Incident Response 
Capability-Technical Centre (NCIRC-TC), Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) and National 
Defence Radio Establishment (FRA) also participated in the CDX.

BIRTH OF A CONCEPT: STRATEGIC CYBER SECURITY
BT personnel are normally real-life system administrators and computer security 
specialists. Their goal is to defend the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) 
of their computer networks against hostile RT attacks. In BCS 2010, the BTs were 
the primary targets for instruction; their progress was tracked by automated and 
manual scoring systems.
The RT plays the role of a cyber attacker, or in this CDX, a “cyber terrorist.” The RT 
attempts to undermine the CIA of BT networks, using a variety of hacker tools and 
tactics.173 In a “white box” test, RTs may be given detailed, prior knowledge of the BT 
networks; a “black box” test requires the RT to gather this information on its own.174 
Either way, RTs – just like real-life hackers – have an enormous advantage over their 
BT counterparts because they can often methodically work their way through vari-
ous cyber attacks until they succeed in hacking the network.175
The WT manages and referees the CDX. Normally, it writes the game’s scenario, 
rules, and scoring system. The WT will make in-game adjustments in an effort to en-
sure that all participants are gainfully employed throughout the CDX. It also seeks 
to prevent cheating. For example, if a particular firewall rule appeared to be detri-
mental to the game and/or unrealistic in real-life, the WT may disallow it. Finally, 
the WT often declares a CDX “winner.”
The GT is responsible for designing and hosting the CDX network infrastructure. It 
is the in-game “Internet Service Provider” (ISP). To allow for post-game analysis, the 
GT should attempt to record all CDX network traffic. With the aid of virtual machine 
technology, it is technically possible to carry out a CDX on a handful of computers. 
However, to simulate a powerful adversary, significant resources are required, and 
a time- and labor-intensive CDX is unavoidable. (The RT, for example, should have a 
plan that indicates the availability of significant money and manpower.) With Virtu-
al Private Network (VPN) technology, the RT, BTs, and WT can be located anywhere 
in the world and remotely connect to the CDX environment. All automatic scoring in 
the CDX is implemented by the GT.
Cyber warfare is very different from traditional warfare. Tactical victories amount 
to a reshuffling of the electronic bits of data – also known as ones and zeros – inside 
173 Preimesberger, 2006: In the U.S., Sandia National Laboratories have developed eight “natural 
categories” of Red Teaming: design assurance, hypothesis testing, benchmarking, behavioral Red 
Teaming, gaming, operational Red Teaming, penetration testing, and analytic Red Teaming.
174 A black box is often considered more realistic because real-world hackers normally find themselves 
in this position. However, given strict time limits, white box CDXs are the norm. In BCS 2010, the RT 
had access to the initial BT network for three weeks prior to the CDX.
175 Geers, 2010: In a CDX, this depends in part on the complexity of the network the BTs have to defend 
and the amount of time the RT has to attack it. In the real world, hackers can often remain anonymous 
in cyberspace, so deterring cyber attacks is difficult. Attackers may be able to keep trying to crack a 
network until they succeed, and there is normally no penalty for the failed attempts.

Cyber Security: A Technical Primer
a computer. At that point, an attacker must wait to see if any intended real-world ef-
fects actually occur. A cyber attack is best understood not as an end in itself, but as 
an extraordinary means to a wide variety of ends: espionage,176 denial of service,177 
identity theft,178 propaganda,179 and even the destruction of critical infrastructure.180
The primary goal of a CDX is to credibly simulate the attack and defense of a com-
puter network. At the tactical level, the RT has the same goals as any real-world 
hacker – to gain unauthorized access to the target network.181 If “administrator” 
or “root” access is obtained, the intruder may be able to install malicious software 
and erase incriminating evidence at will. Further actions, possibly aimed to support 
some political or military goal, could range in impact from a minor annoyance to a 
national security crisis.
The CDX “scenario” is helpful in determining the overall strategic significance of an 
exercise. A well-written scenario should estimate the required resources and pro-
jected cost of a theoretical attack. This in turn helps national security planners to 
determine whether a person, group, or nation could attempt it. For example, it still 
remains difficult to imagine a lone hacker posing a threat to a nation-state.182 How-
ever, future cyber attacks might change that perception.
It is almost impossible for a limited-duration CDX to simulate the threat posed by 
a nation-state. Military and intelligence agencies are “full-scope” actors that do not 
rely solely on computer hacking to achieve an important objective. Governments 
draw from a deep well of expertise in many IT disciplines, including cryptogra-
176 “Tracking GhostNet...,” 2009: The most famous case to date is “GhostNet,” investigated by Information 
Warfare Monitor, in which a cyber espionage network of over 1,000 compromised computers in 103 
countries targeted diplomatic, political, economic, and military information.

knocking the entire nation-state of Kyrgyzstan offline.
178 Gorman, 2009b: American identities and software were reportedly used to attack Georgian 
government websites during its 2008 war with Russia.
179 Goble, 1999: Since the earliest days of the Web, Chechen guerilla fighters have demonstrated the 
power of Internet-enabled propaganda. “‘USA Today’ Website Hacked...” 2002: On a lighter note, a 
hacker placed a series of fake articles on the USA Today website. One read, “Today, George W. Bush 
has proposed ... a Cabinet Minister for Propoganda and Popular Englightenment [sic].... If approved, 
Bush would appoint Dr. Joseph Goebbels to the post.”
180 Meserve, 2007: Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials briefed CNN that Idaho National 
Laboratory (INL) researchers had hacked into a replica of a power plant’s control system and changed 
the operating cycle of a generator, causing it to self-destruct.
181 There are exceptions, such as a denial-of-service attack in which the main goal is to overload the 
system with superfluous data.
182 Verton, 2002: Nonetheless, it is astonishing what some lone hackers have been able to accomplish. 
In 2001, “MafiaBoy,” a 15 year-old from Montreal, was able to deny Internet service to some of the 
world’s biggest online companies, causing an estimated $1.7 billion in damage.

phy, programming, debugging, vulnerability discovery, agent-based systems, etc.183 
Those skill sets are in turn supported by experts in the natural sciences, physical 
security, supply chain operations, continuity of business, social engineering,184 and 
many more.
The Sandia National Laboratories RT, based in New Mexico, provides a robust model. 
Sandia has a long track record of successfully hacking its clients, which include 
military installations, oil companies, banks, electric utilities, and e-commerce firms. 
Its RT takes pride in finding hidden vulnerabilities in complex environments,185 in-
cluding obscure infrastructure interdependencies in highly specialized domains.186 
A former Sandia RT leader put it best: “Our general method is to ask system owners: 
‘What’s your worst nightmare?’ and then we set about to make that happen.”187
Every CDX is unique. There are simply too many variables in cyberspace, and IT con-
