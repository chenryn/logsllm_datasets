## Abstract
Leakage resilience (LR) and misuse resistance (MR) are critical properties for the deployment of authenticated encryption (AE) schemes. These properties aim to mitigate the impact of implementation flaws due to side-channel leakages and misused randomness. In this paper, we explore the interactions and incompatibilities between LR and MR.

We start from the standard definition of MR for AE schemes as proposed by Rogaway and Shrimpton and argue that it may be overly stringent in the presence of leakages. Consequently, we revert to the fundamental security requirements for AE: ciphertext integrity (INT-CTXT) and CPA security. We introduce a new notion of CIML (Ciphertext Integrity with Misuse and Leakage) security, which extends INT-CTXT in the presence of misuse and leakages.

We examine the extent to which previous MR AE schemes provide CIML security and find that they do not. We then propose two new efficient CIML-secure AE schemes: DTE, which is secure in the standard model, and DCE, which is secure in the random oracle model but offers efficiency benefits. We observe that these constructions are non-trivial; for instance, the composition of an LR MAC and an LR encryption scheme, while providing a traditional MR AE scheme, can lose the MR property in the presence of leakages and fail to achieve CIML security.

Finally, we demonstrate the LR CPA security of both DTE and DCE.

## 1 Introduction
Authenticated Encryption (AE) has become the standard primitive for secure message transmission. Following its introduction by Bellare and Namprempre [9] and Katz and Yung [26], and subsequent standardization efforts, AE schemes have been widely adopted, such as in TLS 1.3 for record protection [39]. The ease of use of AE compared to earlier solutions based on combinations of encryption and message authentication codes (MACs) has significantly reduced security issues [2, 18, 36].

Significant efforts have been made to enhance the robustness of AE schemes against various misuses and implementation issues. For example, one line of work focuses on mitigating the effects of poor-quality IVs [42], ensuring that the damage from such misuses is minimal. This is a substantial improvement over schemes that can fully leak their long-term secret key if the same randomness is used twice [35].

In this work, we explore the combination of misuse resistance (MR) and leakage resilience (LR). LR aims to ensure that cryptographic schemes remain secure even in the presence of side-channel leakages, such as those resulting from timing, power consumption, or electromagnetic emissions. While initially focused on embedded devices, LR is now a desirable feature for high-end devices, following recent works on timing attacks against OpenSSL [1, 22] and power and electromagnetic analysis of ARM cores [5, 28].

Our focus is on LR for leakages occurring during encryption. This is particularly relevant in applications where only one party (e.g., a power-constrained smart card) is responsible for encryption and may produce side-channel leakages, while the other party (e.g., a reader) can be physically shielded. Even in bidirectional communications, many standards (e.g., TLS [39]) use different keys for each direction, making it important to protect the encryption key independently of the decryption key. We also note that achieving LR decryption or integrity verification can be more challenging due to their deterministic nature [37, 31].

This focus on encryption makes our work distinct from other robustness improvements for AE, which address information leakages from decryption error messages and incorrect ciphertexts [3, 7, 13, 24].

### Our Contributions
In the absence of security definitions for LR AE, we start by considering the definition of MR AE and attempt to extend it to include LR. Informally, an AE scheme is MR-secure if it produces ciphertexts that look random, even to an adversary controlling the random IV or nonce, and if it is infeasible to produce a valid ciphertext that decrypts to a message other than the one encrypted. Extending MR AE to LR MR AE is challenging because it requires defining leakages for both the encryption and random oracles, which is non-trivial.

Given this difficulty, we return to the original security requirements for AE: ciphertext integrity (INT-CTXT) and CPA security [9]. We propose a new notion of CIML (Ciphertext Integrity with Misuse and Leakage) security, which measures the hardness of producing a fresh valid ciphertext in the presence of an oracle that provides ciphertexts and associated leakages when queried on adversarially chosen messages and IVs or nonces.

We then investigate the CIML security of several MR AE schemes and find that popular SIV-based constructions [42] offer little protection in the presence of leakages. Surprisingly, even combining recent LR encryption and MAC schemes [37] into a MR AE scheme (PSV-AE) results in a scheme that is still sensitive to side-channel attacks and not CIML-secure.

To address this, we design two new AE schemes, DTE (Digest, Tag and Encrypt) and DCE (Digest, Commit and Encrypt), and show that they are CIML-secure. DTE is secure in the standard model and requires two executions of the leak-free component, while DCE is more efficient, requiring only one execution, but is secure only in the random oracle model. DCE is not a MR AE scheme as its ciphertexts do not look random.

We conclude by demonstrating the LR CPA security of DTE and DCE, using the simulatable leakage model [43] extended to capture hash functions. This ensures that our CIML-secure schemes maintain the same LR CPA security level as previously published LR encryption schemes.

The properties of our constructions are summarized in Table 1.
