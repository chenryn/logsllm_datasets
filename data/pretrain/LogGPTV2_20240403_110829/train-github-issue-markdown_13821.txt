When a client's HTTP header contains `Expect: 100-continue`, and the client is posting `multipart/form-data`, there may be an issue where the following error occurs:

```
"multipart: Part Read: WSARecv from _._.138.250:80: i/o timeout"
```

This error is encountered at the `ParseMultipartForm(102400)` function in the `/mime/multipart/multipart.go` file, specifically at line 239. The error is returned immediately, and the `ReadTimeout` is not reached.

Interestingly, when the same service is run on the same machine but using IIS (Internet Information Services), this problem does not occur.
