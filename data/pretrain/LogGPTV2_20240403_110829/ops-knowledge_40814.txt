User: In CentOS Linux, how to install and configure the Nginx web server through the yum package manager, and use Nginx to implement reverse proxy and load balancing functions?
Assistant: The following are the steps to install and configure the Nginx web server using the yum package manager in CentOS Linux, and use Nginx to implement the reverse proxy and load balancing functions: 1. Use the root user to log in to the system 2. Execute the following command to update the system software package: ` `` yum update ``` 3. Execute the following command to install Nginx: ``` yum install nginx ``` 4. Start the Nginx service: ``` systemctl start nginx ``` 5. Use the following command to view the status of the Nginx service: ` `` systemctl status nginx ``` 6. Modify firewall rules to allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic: ``` firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=http firewall-cmd --permanent -- zone=public --add-service=https firewall-cmd --reload ``` 7. Test that the Nginx service is properly installed and running with the following command: ``` curl http://localhost ``` If you see The default page of Nginx means that you have successfully installed Nginx and it is running. 8. Configure the reverse proxy and load balancing function Create a new configuration file in the /etc/nginx/conf.d directory, such as myapp.conf: ``` vi /etc/nginx/conf.d/myapp.conf ` `` Add the following to the file: ``` upstream backend { server backend1.example.com:8080; server backend2.example.com:8080; } server { listen 80; server_name example.com; location / { proxy_pass http: //backend/; } } ``` Here, an upstream server group named backend is defined, in which there are two servers backend1.example.com and backend2.example.com, and the port is 8080. Then proxy the request to either of these two servers using the proxy_pass directive. Therefore, when a request is sent to example.com, Nginx will load balance backend1.example.com and backend2.example.com and forward the request to one of the servers. 9. Reload the Nginx configuration for the changes to take effect: ``` systemctl reload nginx ``` At this point, you should be able to access your web application via http://example.com, and all requests to the application should be Reverse proxying and load balancing will be done through Nginx.
