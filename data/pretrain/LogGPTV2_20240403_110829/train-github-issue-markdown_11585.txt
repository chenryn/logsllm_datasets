 **Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**  
Probably neither, but I am stuck with this.
**What is the current behavior?**  
Rendering multiple rows in table that are expanded by the "parent" row is not
possible due to not being permitted in and the absence of fragmentation
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and
if possible a minimal demo of the problem viahttps://jsfiddle.net or similar
(template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**  
Here's to get an idea https://jsfiddle.net/69z2wepo/67419/
**What is the expected behavior?**  
This is the expected behaviour, I guess, until Fiber lands. I am just looking
for an explanation on how to achieve this.
**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
Did this work in previous versions of React?**  
I am on 15.3.2 but probably all pre-fiber versions have this.
Thanks for any help!
