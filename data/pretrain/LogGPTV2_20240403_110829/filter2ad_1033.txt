### Interdisciplinary Approaches to Achieving and Analyzing System Dependability

Many current and anticipated challenges in system dependability exceed the capabilities of conventional techniques, research methods, and scientific knowledge familiar to the DSN (Dependable Systems and Networks) community. Modern computer-based systems are characterized by a complex interplay between technical, human, and environmental components. Unforeseen issues often emerge from the interactions among these components, potentially undermining the effectiveness of traditional DSN disciplines, which primarily focus on reliable hardware and software.

The success of hardware and software reliability engineering has, paradoxically, increased the significance of emergent problems. For example, unanticipated user behavior, influenced by system design, can invalidate the assumptions made by designers. Addressing these challenges effectively requires enhanced collaboration across various relevant disciplines, including those not typically represented in the DSN community. These disciplines can contribute valuable models or solution methods from non-computer application areas, such as modeling very large-scale systems, recognizing emergent behaviors, and solving or visualizing complex models. They can also address specific factors affecting dependability, such as human cognition, motivation, and organizational culture.

Examples of dependability issues that could benefit from interdisciplinary contributions include:

- **Unanticipated Use of Technology:** Users may rely on automatic devices designed for sporadic failures, leading to poor dependability. Alternatively, users may intentionally violate procedures under organizational pressures, contrary to the designers' assumptions.
- **Misunderstanding Due to Automation:** Automation can lead to incorrect user interpretations of situations, such as confusion about an aircraft's actions due to mode changes in flight management systems.
- **Maintenance and Administration Issues:** Problems in maintenance and system administration, caused by technical, human, and organizational factors, can affect system dependability. Examples include poorly designed administrator software, decision support, and social engineering attacks.
- **Environmental Influences:** Unpredicted environmental factors or demands can cause system breakdowns, such as traffic volumes exceeding design expectations or surges in usage during critical emergencies.
- **Legal Constraints:** Legal requirements can lead to unintended consequences in system design, affecting dependability.
- **Interdisciplinary Integration:** Combining arguments from different specialist methods in various languages without standard integration practices can complicate the case for system dependability.

The primary goal of this workshop is to convene experts from diverse disciplines and application domains to exchange ideas, foster concrete progress across disciplinary boundaries, and establish contacts and potential collaborations. The workshop aims to be valuable for all DSN participants by introducing related disciplines, providing examples of their contributions, and encouraging consideration of issues that individual specialisms might overlook. It will also serve as a forum for participants to express needs for interdisciplinary work and share experiences.

Selected contributions will cover intersections between the standard concerns of dependable systems and networks and those of psychology, sociology, law, and other underrepresented but closely related fields, such as human-computer interaction and human reliability. The workshop format will emphasize extensive discussion to facilitate effective idea exchange among participants from different backgrounds.
