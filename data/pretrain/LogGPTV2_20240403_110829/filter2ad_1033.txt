Many  current  and  expected  problems  in  system
dependability push the limits of the practical techniques,
research  methods  and  scientific  knowledge  that  are
familiar  to  the  DSN  audience.  Computer-based  systems
involve  a  complex  interaction  of  technical  and  human
components set in the context of a physical environment.
Unanticipated  problems  arise  as  emergent  properties  of
the interplay between these different system components,
and  may  defeat  the  efforts  of  the  “traditional”  DSN
disciplines  which  focus  on  dependable  computer
hardware and software. The very success of hardware and
software  reliability  engineering  may  increase  the
importance  of 
these  emergent  problems,  e.g.
unanticipated  user  behaviour,  affected  by  computer
design  and  in  its  turn  invalidating  the  designers’
assumptions.    Understanding  these  problems  effectively
requires  improved  interaction  between  disciplines
relevant to these various components, including those that
are not usually represented in the DSN community. These
disciplines  may  help  by  providing  models  or  solution
methods  from  non-computer  application  areas  that  have
faced  similar  problems  (e.g.,  modelling  very  large-scale
systems,  recognising  emergent  behaviours,  solving  or
visualising complex models), or by dealing with specific
factors  that  affect  dependability  (e.g.,  human  cognition,
motivation and organisational culture).
Examples  of  the  dependability  problems  that  may
benefit  from  contributions  from  outside  the  usual  DSN
spectrum are:
•  where  unanticipated  use  of  technology  leads  to  poor
dependability: for example, users learn to rely,  as part
of the normal execution of tasks, on automatic devices
meant only to protect against sporadic human failures;
or,  users  intentionally  violate  (under  organisational
pressures  and  constraints)  the  procedures  assumed  by
automation designers;
• where  automation  leads  to  incorrect  understanding  by
users  of  an  unfolding  situation  (for  example,  where
modes in the design of a flight management system lead
to confusion about what the aircraft is actually doing);
•  where  problems 
in  maintenance  and  system
administration  -  due  to  technical,  human  and
organisational factors - affect system dependability (for
instance, poor design of system administrator software
or  decision  support;  “social  engineering”  attacks  and
their  implications  for  design  of  automation  and  of
procedures);
•  where  unpredicted  environmental  influences  or
demands    lead  to  system  break  down  (where  traffic
volumes  exceed  those  imagined  when  the  system  was
designed; in critical emergency situations with surges in
the usage of critical facilities);
• where legal constraints lead to design solutions which
affect dependability in unintended ways;
•  where a case for the dependability of a system involves
arguments produced by different specialist methods in
different specialist languages, without standard ways of
combining them.
The goal of this workshop is to bring together experts
from  different  disciplines  and  application  domains  to
exchange 
ideas,  make  concrete  progress  across
disciplinary  barriers,  and  establish  contacts  and  possible
collaborations. At the same time, it is meant to be of value
to  all  DSN  participants,  providing  some  introduction  to
the  related  disciplines  that  have  value  for  current
dependability  problems,  examples  of  what  they  can
deliver,  a  challenge  to  consider  problems  that  our
individual specialisms may make us neglect, to our peril,
and  a  forum  for  participants  to  express  needs  for
interdisciplinary  work  and  experience  about  its  uses  and
problems.
The selected contributions cover overlaps between the
“standard” concerns of dependable systems and networks
and  those  of  psychology,  sociology  and  other  “human”
sciences,  the  law,  or  disciplines  that  although  closely
related  to  DSN  are  usually  under-represented,  like
human-computer  interaction  and  human  reliability.  The
format  of  the  workshop  will  emphasize  extensive
discussion and be geared to achieve effective interchange
of ideas among people from different backgrounds.
