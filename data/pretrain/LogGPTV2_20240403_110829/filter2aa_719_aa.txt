# Hacking Embedded Devices: Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Hardware

## About the Hosts
- **Phorkus**: A tinkerer since the age of 5, Phorkus has a history of breaking thingsâ€”sometimes with a hammer, other times with a soldering iron.
- **EvilRob**: With a penchant for causing mayhem and devastating electronics, EvilRob has been at it even before he discovered beer. Beer is good; fire, not so much.

## Acknowledgments
We would like to thank the following individuals whose work made this presentation possible:
- **Joe Grand** (familiar from TV)
- **Emerson Tan** (for his insights into methylene chloride)
- **Flylogic's silicon device attacks** (visit [Flylogic's blog](http://www.flylogic.net/blog/))
- **Everyone who has experimented with Arduino, AVR, ARM, MIPS, etc.**
- **Our families** for their support as we filled our homes with archaic electronics.

## Purpose
- We will present a series of steps to help you evaluate a device for potential security vulnerabilities.
- Our goal is to provide a set of repeatable tasks that will enable you to begin both hardware and software assessments.
- We are also setting up a community site to share information on devices that people are working on cracking.

## Getting Started
### Essential Equipment and Tools
You will need several key pieces of physical equipment and software tools. Most of these items are affordable, typically ranging from $500 to $1,000.

#### Key Items
- **Your Brain**: Always prioritize safety. Electricity can be dangerous. Be aware of your surroundings when soldering, wear safety glasses, and take precautions to avoid injury.
- **Voltmeter**: Essential for circuit probing. It is used to test electrical resistance, check diode conductivity, and measure circuit voltage. USB voltmeters are great for recording data directly to your computer. We recommend a $60 USB model from SparkFun Electronics.
- **Surface Mount Soldering/Hot Air Rework Station**: Available on Amazon for around $160, this tool is excellent for removing surface mount components without damaging the board.
- **Soldering Supplies**: 
  - Solder wick (for removing solder)
  - Insulated tweezers or micro-forceps
  - Solder
  - Flux
  - Chip puller
- **Magnifying Glass**: High-power magnifying glasses with lights are essential. Consider using Rain-X or anti-fog spray to prevent fogging.
- **USB Microscope**: Useful for examining contacts, chip numbers, board traces, and other small details.
- **Bus Pirate**: This tool is used to read and wire to almost every raw "bus protocol." It has a gentle learning curve but is not ideal for scripting automated tasks. The Bus Pirate has an active community. You can get one from [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9544).
- **Spare Parts**: eBay is a great source for spare parts. Search for "sample packs" containing resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, LEDs, etc. These parts are necessary for replacing blown components.
- **Debugging Interfaces**: If the device lacks a JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) interface, you can add one. A good debugging set should include JTAGs, BDM (Background Debugger Mode Interface), and ISP (In-System Programming) devices.
- **IDA Pro**: This software is invaluable for disassembling and analyzing code. It converts compiled code into "C-like" code for analysis. While it is on the expensive side, it is worth the investment. IDA Pro is available from [Hex-Rays](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/index.shtml).

## Defining the Device
- **Marketing Name**: What is the device's marketing name?
- **Third-Party Device**: Is it a third-party device (e.g., a cable modem)?
- **Non-Obvious Name**: Does it have a non-obvious name?
- **Part Number**: Does it have a part number from the manufacturer?
- **FCC ID**: Does it have an FCC ID?

### Marketing Name
The OEM process often introduces a lot of commodity hardware under different brands. For example:
- Many PC-based "secure appliances" are rebranded Intel servers.
- EMC devices
- Sun's V20 and V40 lines
- RSA Appliances

### Third-Party Devices
- Did someone give it to you or your organization?
