### 2. C-SCRM Policy
The C-SCRM policies direct the implementation of the C-SCRM strategy. They can be developed at Level 1 and/or Level 2 and are informed by mission- and business-specific factors, including risk context, risk decisions, and risk activities from the C-SCRM strategy. These policies support applicable enterprise policies (e.g., acquisition and procurement, information security and privacy, logistics, quality, and supply chain). The C-SCRM policies address the goals and objectives outlined in the enterprise’s C-SCRM strategy, which is informed by the enterprise’s strategic plan. They also address mission and business functions, internal and external customer requirements, and define integration points for C-SCRM with the risk management processes. Finally, they specify C-SCRM roles and responsibilities, interdependencies, and interactions at a more granular level.

### 3. C-SCRM Plan
The C-SCRM plan is developed at Tier 3, is implementation-specific, and provides policy implementation, requirements, constraints, and implications. It can either be stand-alone or a component of a system security and privacy plan. If incorporated, the C-SCRM components must be clearly discernable. The C-SCRM plan addresses the management, implementation, and monitoring of C-SCRM controls and the development and sustainment of systems across the SDLC to support mission and business functions. The C-SCRM plan applies to high- and moderate-impact systems per [FIPS 199].

Given that supply chains can differ significantly across and within enterprises, C-SCRM plans should be tailored to individual programs, enterprises, and operational contexts. Tailored C-SCRM plans provide the basis for determining whether a technology, service, system component, or system is fit for purpose, and as such, the controls need to be tailored accordingly. Tailored C-SCRM plans help enterprises focus their resources on the most critical mission and business functions based on mission and business requirements and their risk environment.

The following C-SCRM plan template is provided only as an example. Enterprises have the flexibility to develop and implement various approaches for the development and presentation of the C-SCRM plan. Enterprises can leverage automated tools to ensure that all relevant sections of the C-SCRM plan are captured. Automated tools can help document C-SCRM plan information, such as component inventories, individuals filling roles, security control implementation information, system diagrams, supply chain component criticality, and interdependencies.

#### 3.1. C-SCRM Plan Template

##### 3.1.1. System Name and Identifier
Designate a unique identifier and/or name for the system. Include any applicable historical names and relevant Tier 1 and Tier 2 document titles.

- **Sample Text**:
  - This C-SCRM plan provides an overview of the security requirements for the [system name] [unique identifier] and describes the supply chain cybersecurity controls in place or planned for implementation to provide fit-for-purpose C-SCRM controls that are appropriate for the information to be transmitted, processed, or stored by the system.
  - The security safeguards implemented for the [unique identifier] meet the requirements set forth in the enterprise’s C-SCRM strategy and policy guidance.

##### 3.1.2. System Description
Describe the function, purpose, and scope of the system, and include a description of the information processed. Provide a general description of the system’s approach to managing supply chain risks associated with the research and development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations and maintenance, and disposal of the following systems, system components, or system services.

- **Sample Text**:
  - [The enterprise’s] document management system (DMS) serves to provide dynamic information repositories, file hierarchies, and collaboration functionality to streamline internal team communication and coordination. The data managed within the system contains personally identifiable information (PII). The DMS is a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solution that was purchased directly from a verified supplier, [supplier’s name], within the United States. It has been functionally configured to meet the enterprise’s needs. No third-party code libraries are utilized to deploy or maintain the system. It is hosted within the management layer of the enterprise’s primary virtual private cloud provider.
