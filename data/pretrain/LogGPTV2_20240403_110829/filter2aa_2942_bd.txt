Sample Text 
• Enterprise: An organization with a defined mission, goal, and boundary that uses 
information systems to execute that mission and has the responsibility for managing its 
own risks and performance. An enterprise may consist of all or some of the following 
business aspects: acquisition, program management, financial management (e.g., 
budgets), human resources, security, and information systems, information, and mission 
management. 
• Objective: An enterprise’s broad expression of goals and a specified target outcome for 
operations. 
1.1.7. Revision and Maintenance 
Define the required frequency of Strategy and Implementation template revisions. Maintain a 
table of revisions to enforce version control. Strategy and Implementation templates are living 
documents that must be updated and communicated to all appropriate individuals (e.g., staff, 
contractors, and suppliers). 
Sample Text 
[The enterprise’s] Strategy and Implementation template must be reviewed every 3-5 years 
(within the federal environment), at a minimum, since changes to laws, policies, standards, 
guidelines, and controls are dynamic and evolving. Additional criteria that may trigger interim 
revisions include: 
• Change of policies that impact the Strategy and Implementation template, 
• Significant Strategy and Implementation events, 
• The introduction of new technologies, 
• The discovery of new vulnerabilities,  
• Operational or environmental changes,  
• Shortcomings in the Strategy and Implementation template,  
• Change of scope, and 
• Other enterprise-specific criteria.

2. C-SCRM POLICY 
The C-SCRM policies direct the implementation of the C-SCRM strategy. The C-SCRM policies 
can be developed at Level 1 and/or at Level 2 and are informed by mission- and business-
specific factors, including risk context, risk decisions, and risk activities from the C-SCRM 
strategy. The C-SCRM policies support applicable enterprise policies (e.g., acquisition and 
procurement, information security and privacy, logistics, quality, and supply chain). The C-
SCRM policies address the goals and objectives outlined in the enterprise’s C-SCRM strategy, 
which in turn is informed by the enterprise’s strategic plan. The C-SCRM policies should also 
address mission and business functions, as well as internal and external customer requirements. 
C-SCRM policies also define the integration points for C-SCRM with the risk management 
processes for the enterprise. Finally, the C-SCRM policies the C-SCRM roles and 
responsibilities within the enterprise define at a more specific and granular level, any 
interdependencies among those roles, and the interaction between the roles. The C-SCRM 
policies at Level 1 are broader, whereas the C-SCRM policies at Level 2 are specific to the 
mission and business function. C-SCRM roles specify the responsibilities for procurement, 
conducting risk assessments, collecting supply chain threat intelligence, identifying and 
implementing risk-based mitigations, monitoring, and other C-SCRM functions.

2.1.2. Description 
Describe the purpose and scope of the C-SCRM policy, outline the enterprise leadership’s intent 
to adhere to the plan, enforce its controls, and ensure that it remains current. Define the tier(s) 
at which the policy applies. C-SCRM policies may need to be derived in whole or in part from 
existing policies or other guidance. 
For Level 2, C-SCRM policies should list all Level 1 policies and plans that inform the Level 2 
policies, provide a brief explanation of what the mission and business encompass, and briefly 
describe the scope of applicability (e.g., plans, systems, type of procurements, etc.) for the Level 
2 C-SCRM policies. 
Sample Level 1 Text 
[The enterprise] is concerned about the risks in the products, services, and solutions bought, 
used, and offered to customers.    
The policy objective of the [the enterprise’s] C-SCRM Program is to successfully implement and 
sustain the capability of providing improved assurance that the products, services, and solutions 
used and offered by [the enterprise] are trustworthy, appropriately secure and resilient, and able 
to perform to the required quality standard.  
C-SCRM is a systematic process for identifying and assessing susceptibilities, vulnerabilities, 
and threats throughout the supply chain and implementing strategies and mitigation controls to 
reduce risk exposure and combat threats. The establishment and sustainment of an enterprise-
wide C-SCRM Program will enable [the enterprise’s] risk owners to identify, assess, and 
mitigate supply chain risk to [the enterprise’s] mission assets, functions, and associated services. 
Sample Level 2 Text 
[The mission and business process] recognizes its criticality to [the enterprise’s objectives]. A 
key component of producing products involves coordinating among multiple suppliers, 
developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related 
service providers. [The mission and business process] recognizes that the realization of 
cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain may disrupt or completely inhibit [the mission 
and business process’s] ability to generate products in a timely manner and in accordance with 
the required quality standard. 
Based on the C-SCRM objectives set forth by [Enterprise Level 1 Policy], [the mission and 
business process’s] policy objective is to implement C-SCRM capabilities that allow for the

3. C-SCRM PLAN 
The C-SCRM plan is developed at Tier 3, is implementation-specific, and provides policy 
implementation, requirements, constraints, and implications. It can either be stand-alone or a 
component of a system security and privacy plan. If incorporated, the C-SCRM components 
must be clearly discernable. The C-SCRM plan addresses the management, implementation, and 
monitoring of C-SCRM controls and the development and sustainment of systems across the 
SDLC to support mission and business functions. The C-SCRM plan applies to high- and 
moderate-impact systems per [FIPS 199]. 
Given that supply chains can differ significantly across and within enterprises, C-SCRM plans 
should be tailored to individual programs, enterprises, and operational contexts. Tailored C-
SCRM plans provide the basis for determining whether a technology, service, system 
component, or system is fit for purpose, and as such, the controls need to be tailored accordingly. 
Tailored C-SCRM plans help enterprises focus their resources on the most critical mission and 
business functions based on mission and business requirements and their risk environment. 
The following C-SCRM plan template is provided only as an example. Enterprises have the 
flexibility to develop and implement various approaches for the development and presentation of 
the C-SCRM plan. Enterprises can leverage automated tools to ensure that all relevant sections 
of the C-SCRM plan are captured. Automated tools can help document C-SCRM plan 
information, such as component inventories, individuals filling roles, security control 
implementation information, system diagrams, supply chain component criticality, and 
interdependencies. 
3.1. C-SCRM Plan Template 
3.1.1. System Name and Identifier  
Designate a unique identifier and/or name for the system. Include any applicable historical 
names and relevant Tier 1 and Tier 2 document titles.

Sample Text 
This C-SCRM plan provides an overview of the security requirements for the [system name] 
[unique identifier] and describes the supply chain cybersecurity controls in place or planned for 
implementation to provide fit-for-purpose C-SCRM controls that are appropriate for the 
information to be transmitted, processed, or stored by the system. 
The security safeguards implemented for the [unique identifier] meet the requirements set forth 
in the enterprise’s C-SCRM strategy and policy guidance. 
3.1.2. System Description 
Describe the function, purpose, and scope of the system, and include a description of the 
information processed. Provide a general description of the system’s approach to managing 
supply chain risks associated with the research and development, design, manufacturing, 
acquisition, delivery, integration, operations and maintenance, and disposal of the following 
systems, system components, or system services.  
Ensure that the C-SCRM plan describes the system in the context of the enterprise’s supply chain 
risk tolerance, acceptable supply chain risk mitigation strategies or controls, a process for 
consistently evaluating and monitoring supply chain risk, approaches for implementing and 
communicating the plan, and a description of and justification for supply chain risk mitigation 
measures taken. Descriptions must be consistent with the high-level mission and business 
functions of the system; the authorization boundary of the system; the overall system 
architecture, including any supporting systems and relationships; how the system supports 
enterprise missions; and the system environment (e.g., stand-alone, managed/enterprise, 
custom/specialized, security-limited functionality, cloud) established in Level 1 and Level 2. 
Sample Text 
 [The enterprise’s] document management system (DMS) serves to provide dynamic information 
repositories, file hierarchies, and collaboration functionality to streamline internal team 
communication and coordination. The data managed within the system contains personally 
identifiable information (PII). The DMS is a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solution that was 
purchased directly from a verified supplier, [supplier’s name], within the United States. It has 
been functionally configured to meet the enterprise’s needs. No third-party code libraries are 
utilized to deploy or maintain the system. It is hosted within the management layer of the 
enterprise’s primary virtual private cloud provider.
