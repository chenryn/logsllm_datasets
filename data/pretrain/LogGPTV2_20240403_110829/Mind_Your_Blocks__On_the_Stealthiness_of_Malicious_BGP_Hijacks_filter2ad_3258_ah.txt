we wanted to conﬁrm our results by further investigating the
root causes of the validated hijacks from a spam campaign per-
spective. Assuming we could identify good candidate hijacks
that are perfectly matching the anomalous routing behavior
of BGP spectrum agility spammers, one would expect that
spam campaigns launched from these hijacked networks, by
the same group of agile spammers, should intuitively share
also a number of commonalities with respect to spam features
(e.g., advertised URI’s, sender’s address, etc).
We have thus used a multi-criteria clustering framework
called TRIAGE [42] to identify series of spam emails sent from
different hijacked IP address blocks that seem to be part of a
campaign orchestrated by the same agile spammers. TRIAGE
is a software framework for security data mining that relies
on intelligent data fusion algorithms to reliably group events
or entities likely linked to the same root cause. Thanks to
a multi-criteria clustering approach, it can identify complex
patterns and varying relationships among groups of events
within a dataset. TRIAGE is best described as a security tool
designed for intelligence extraction and attack investigation,
helping analysts to determine the patterns and behaviors of
the intruders and typically used to highlight how they operate.
This novel clustering approach has demonstrated its utility in
the context of other security investigations, e.g., rogue AV
campaigns [18], spam botnets [44] and targeted attacks [43].
2Disclaimer: We acknowledge that some inadequacies in the data exist
leading to false positives. Nevertheless, as shown later, the pattern coming
out of our dataset builds to a very compelling case.
Fig. 2. Clustering spam emails sent from hijacked networks using TRIAGE.
Figure 2 illustrates the TRIAGE workﬂow, as applied to
our spam dataset. In step x, a number of email characteristics
(or features) are selected and deﬁned as decision criteria for
linking related spam emails. Such characteristics include the
sender IP address, the email subject, the sending date, the
advertised URL’s and associated domains and whois regis-
tration information. In step y, TRIAGE builds relationships
among all email samples with respect to selected features
using appropriate similarity metrics. For text-based features
(e.g., subject, email addresses), we used string-oriented simi-
larity measures commonly-used in information retrieval, such
as the Levenshtein similarity and N-gram similarity [27].
However, other similarity metrics may be deﬁned to match
the feature type and be consistent
to analyst expectations
(e.g., Jaccard to measure similarity between sets, or a custom
IP addresses similarity metric that is based on their relative
inter-distance in the binary space).
At step z, the individual feature similarities are fused using
an aggregation model reﬂecting a high-level behavior deﬁned
by the analyst, who can impose, e.g., that some portion of
highly similar email features (out of n available) must be
satisﬁed to assign different samples to the same campaign
(regardless of which ones). Similarly to the WOWA aggrega-
tion method explained here above, in TRIAGE we can assign
different weights to individual features, so as to give higher or
lower importance to certain features. For this analysis we gave
more importance to the source IP addresses, domain names
associated to spam URL’s and whois registration names, since
we anticipate that a combination of these features convey a
sense and possible evidence of colluding spam activities.
As outcome (step {), TRIAGE identiﬁes multi-dimensional
clusters (called MDC’s), which in this analysis are clusters
of spam emails in which any pair of emails is linked by
a number of common traits, yet not necessarily always the
same. As explained in [42], a decision threshold can be chosen
such that undesired linkage between attacks are eliminated,
i.e., to drop any irrelevant connection that could result from
a combination of small values or an insufﬁcient number of
