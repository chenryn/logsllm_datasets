 0 Mon Dec 05 03:23:24 2005 error [client 218.207.61.7] Directory index forbidden by rule: /var/www/html/
 1 Mon Dec 05 15:45:44 2005 error mod_jk child workerEnv in error state 6
 2 Sun Dec 04 11:42:43 2005 error [client 216.127.124.16] Directory index forbidden by rule: /var/www/html/

 5 Sun Dec 04 09:35:12 2005 error [client 207.203.80.15] Directory index forbidden by rule: /var/www/html/
The first three parts of the log are index, timestamp, and log level. Without considering these three parts, Here we assume that the variables in the logs are represented as '<*>', separated by spaces between tokens. What is the specific log template for the above logs?

A: [client <*>] Directory index forbidden by rule: <*> 和 mod_jk child workerEnv in error state <*>
B: jk2_init() Found child <*> in scoreboard slot <*> 和 mod_jk child init <*> <*>
C: workerEnv.init() ok <*> 和 jk2_init() Found child <*> in scoreboard slot <*>
D: workerEnv.init() ok <*> 和 jk2_init() Can't find child <*> in scoreboard
