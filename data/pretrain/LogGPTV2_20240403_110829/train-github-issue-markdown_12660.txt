    In the spec, under "For statements", the topic of deleting map entries during
    iteration is addressed with only the sentence:
    > If map entries that have not yet been reached are removed during iteration, the
    corresponding iteration values will not be produced.
    This program appears to work fine:

    But the spec doesn't seem to *guarantee* that it will work. If this is guaranteed
    behavior, can the spec be clarified? Specifically, can this sentence (or one like it) be
    added:
    > The current entry in a map iteration may be safely deleted.
