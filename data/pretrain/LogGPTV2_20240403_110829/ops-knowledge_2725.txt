User: Based on the following AWS resource usage and cost reports, analyze possible waste and provide cost-saving suggestions. As of March 2021, the resource usage on AWS is as follows:<br><br>- EC2 Instances: 50, running a total of 1783 hours per month, costing $4458.67<br>- Lambda Functions: 100, each A total of 1 million monthly function executions cost $130.34<br>- RDS databases: 10, with a total monthly running time of 1207 hours and a cost of $2456.12<br>- S3 object storage: a total monthly storage of 5TB and a cost of $242.45 USD<br><br>The following is a cost analysis of each resource:<br><br>- EC2 instances: There are some instances with low utilization, for example, 4 instances are always idle. It is recommended to use Auto Scaling to automatically adjust the number of instances according to the load, and use AWS Spot instances to replace some On-Demand instances to save costs. In addition, you can optimize instance configuration and use EC2 instance discount programs (such as Reserved Instance) to reduce costs. <br><br>- Lambda function: The number of executions of 1 million times is relatively small. You can consider using AWS's Lambda cold start and warm-up function to optimize function performance and reduce costs. For infrequently used functions, you can use AWS's Lambda timing function to periodically shut down the function. <br><br>- RDS database: During the idle period of resources, you can use the RDS shutdown function of AWS to suspend instances and reduce costs. In addition, you can also use the RDS discount plan to optimize costs, such as purchasing Reserved DB Instances or using Spot Instances. <br><br>- S3 object storage: According to data access frequency and usage, data can be transferred to a more suitable storage level and type. For example, transferring infrequently used data to S3 Glacier or S3 IA storage type can save storage costs. In addition, you can also take advantage of AWS's S3 discount program to reduce costs, such as using S3 Reserved Capacity and S3 Object Storage. <br><br>In summary, in order to optimize the use of AWS resources, we can perform the following actions:<br><br>-Use Auto Scaling, Spot instances and Reserved Instances to reduce EC2 instance costs;<br>-Use Lambda cold Startup and scheduled shutdown functions to reduce Lambda function costs;<br>- use RDS downtime function and discount plan to reduce RDS database costs;<br>- use appropriate storage tier and type according to storage needs, and use S3 discount plan to reduce S3 storage cost.
Assistant: In addition, you can also consider using tools such as AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Trusted Advisor to monitor and optimize resource usage, and adjust resource allocation in a timely manner. In addition, it is recommended to regularly review the resources and services that already exist and terminate those that are no longer needed to prevent unnecessary waste of costs.
