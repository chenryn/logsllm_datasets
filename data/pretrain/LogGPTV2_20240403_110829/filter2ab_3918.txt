**ATT&CK ID:** T1505.003  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Web Shell

Adversaries may deploy web shells on compromised web servers to establish and maintain persistent access to a target network. A web shell is a script, often written in common web development languages such as PHP, ASP, or JSP, that is uploaded to an accessible web server. This script provides adversaries with a backdoor, allowing them to interact with the server and potentially gain further access to the internal network.

Web shells can offer a range of functionalities, including but not limited to, executing commands, managing files, and providing a command-line interface on the host system. These capabilities enable attackers to perform various malicious activities, such as data exfiltration, lateral movement, and further exploitation of the network.
