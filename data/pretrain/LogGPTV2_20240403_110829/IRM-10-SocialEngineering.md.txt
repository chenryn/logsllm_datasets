INCIDENT HANDLING STEPS
6 STEPS ARE DEFINED TO HANDLE SECURITY INCIDENTS
1. Preparation: get ready to handle the incident
2. Identification: detect the incident
3. Containment: limit the impact of the incident
4. Remediation: remove the threat
5. Recovery: recover to a normal stage
6. Lessons learned: draw up and improve the process
IRM provides detailed information for each stepof the incident response process.The steps
come from NIST Computer Security Incident Handling Guide.

Red phone number must be
clearly tagged as “Social

▪ Raiseuserawarenessandsecuritypolicies.
The phone number must be easy

Never give any personal or corporate information to an

▪ Have a defined process to redirect any “weird” request to a “red”

▪ Prepare to handle conversation with social engineers to identify
