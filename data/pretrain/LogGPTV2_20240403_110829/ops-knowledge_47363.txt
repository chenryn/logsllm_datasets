User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题403 error even with 777, ownership, and without htaccess I have a problem with 403 error
Apache is on admin group, files has admin ownership, and 644. .htaccess doesn't matter. 
All php files, and tpl files shows correct, there is only problem with css an js files. 

I'he change permision to 777 without result, also I've deleted .htaccess, with no result. 

I've double checked permisions, and made chown to apache group with subfiles and subfolders, i've made the same thing with chmod with no result

What can I do more?

Assistant: This could be down to seLinux. 

Assuming your CGI environment for PHP is running as a user other than the apache/httpd user, it would explain why the PHP part is working. 
Unless you had placed the other resources in a directory that was already correctly labelled to allow the httpd user access, then I would suspect it is the absence of the correct seLinux context that prevents the files from being served. 

I would check /var/log/audit/audit.log for AVC events relating to HTTPd.
You could use audit2allow to generate suitable rules to solve your problem.
