Android 10 introduced several security enhancements, including a change that restricts applications from accessing clipboard data unless they are in the foreground or set as the deviceâ€™s default input method editor (IME). This update helps to mitigate potential privacy and security risks associated with unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the clipboard.
