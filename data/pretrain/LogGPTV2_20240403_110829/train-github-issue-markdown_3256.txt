**System information**
  * Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
  * OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): 18.04 LTS
  * Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
  * TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Docker container tensorflow/tensorflow:2.0.0b1-gpu-py3
  * TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.0.0-beta1
  * Python version: 3.6
  * Bazel version (if compiling from source):
  * GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
  * CUDA/cuDNN version:
  * GPU model and memory: RTX 2080 Ti
You can collect some of this information using our environment capture  
script  
You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with: 1. TF 1.0: `python -c "import
tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"` 2\. TF 2.0: `python -c
"import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"`
**Describe the current behavior**  
Running the the official example
https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/tutorials/quickstart/advanced in the official
container tensorflow/tensorflow:2.0.0b1-gpu-py3 got the following error:
