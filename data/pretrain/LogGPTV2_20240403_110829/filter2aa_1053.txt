Why Corporate Wireless Still Sucks! 
We’re just nerds with random ideas and 
inconsistent results!

What 
   Obtain Clear-Text 
credentials from any PEAP 
enabled WPA2-Enterprise 
Network without cracking a 
single HASH. 
   Get access to a new set of 
tools that automates all the 
attacks for you. 
How 
   Explore a “Functionality 
Issue” discovered with how 
IOS / OSX devices process 
MSChapV2. 
   Demonstrate the use of 
EAP-GTC as the inner 
authentication mechanism  
in place of MSChapV2

Fine, why not 
Client Responds TLV-Success

Client Checks for Captive Portal 
Attacker Responds with Captive Portal 
Server Challenges Client 
Now that the MITM is complete, we can direct all 
DNS requests to our captive portal page and 
capture credentials in Clear-Text! 
Clear-Text Anyone? 
What Just Happened? 
   IOS/OSX supplicants do not appear to require MSChapV2 
success when connecting to the wireless network. So 
much for mutual authentication L 
   Bypassing inner authentication  
   Establishing a MITM connection 
   Trapping captive portal request sent by the mobile device 
by default, and redirect it to our malicious portal 
   User re enters credentials which are now captured in 
clear-text.  Hackers Win again! 
Responsible Disclosure hahaha, funny! 
The Hacker 
   I discovered a way to expose 
your backdoor and urge you 
to patch it up before someone 
dumps a nasty payload in it! 
Here’s all my research, 
screenshots, etc.. 
   (A month later) Can I get the 
status of ticket number

   Thank You! Though you’re 
probably wrong! We will have 
our outsourced MSP put 10 
tards on it right away and 
never get back to you.  Have a 
blessed day! 
   Hi, me Josh 4379. I see not 
what you say, I like gummy 
bears, ticket closed!... Have a 
blessed day! 
“After examining your report we do not see any actual 
security implications.  It is the responsibility of the client to 
ensure that they are communicating with a trusted server 
before attempting the MSCHAPv2 inner authentication. 
(The server could just as well have suggested the EAP-
GTC protocol, after which the client would have provided 
its password in cleartext as the server instructed.)” 
GENERIC TOKEN CARD 
   EAP Method created by Microsoft/Cisco for use with 
PEAPv1 
   Created to support hardware token cards and one time 
passwords 
   Similar to PEAPv0 EAP-MSCHAPv2 with no peer challenge 
   Some clients do not state what type of password they are 
asking for, they just prompt for a username and password 
   Can we use this to our advantage? 
Client Responds with “GTC” password 
Server Sends TLV-Success anyway 
GTC fails 
No password for user 
Sure I trust you  
why not 
Client Responds TLV-Success 
PEAPINGTOM 
Full connection 
established 
Server Requests one-time password 
Clear-Text Anyone? 
Thanks Radius, it was awesome of you to 
put clear text passwords in your debug file! 
GTC Attack – PEAPingtom 
   Attack works on devices that support PEAPv1-GTC natively. 
   IOS/OSX 
   Android (does not prompt for cert, NEAT!) 
   *n?x works in Ubuntu but does require user setup 
   Windows – safe for now, no native support 
   No captive portal required, MITM attack is trivial and includes 
clear text passwords 
   Instant capture of MSCHAPv2 passwords on IOS devices 
after user accepts certificate from evil twin. 
Things You Need! 
•  Host system 
•  Ubuntu 12.04 
•  Wi-Fi Adapter 
•  Alfa AWUS051NH 
•  Radius Patch 
•  PuNk1n.patch 
•  HAVOC-APPS 
•  LootBooty Wi-Fi Tools 
A historical perspective 
   Cracking hashes is too 
hard 
   Can we trick the client into 
just giving it to us? 
   What if radius accepted 
everything? 
   Started with past work 
from other attacks.
