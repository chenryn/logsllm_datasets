Who Am I
This is NOT going to be
Picking up where we left off
At least as far as last year’s research is concerned...
Boss, is this 
supposed to 
be on the 
internet?
I think this 
is from my 
powerpoint!
We probably 
need to call 
someone...
Finally de-
classified...
(public 
domain)
The initial 
“trace” or lo-
jack used (see 
rabbithole talk 
from 09)
Hungry yet?
This was just the appetizer...
Question 1: What is this?
Perceptions may be 
deceiving...
War
Crime
Government / state
Ofﬁcial backing
Ofﬁcial resources
Financing
Expertise?
Exploits/Vulns?
War
Crime
Private
semi-ofﬁcial backing 
(think organized crime)
Ofﬁcial resources
Self ﬁnancing?
Established expertise 
(in-house + outsourced)
Market for exploits
CyberWar
“Cyberwarfare, (also known as cyberwar 
and Cyber Warfare), is the use of 
computers and the Internet in conducting 
warfare in cyberspace.”
Wikipedia
It did not happen yet
being an exception?
“There is no Cyberwar”
Estonia
This is not the only way!
Neither is this...
But civilian are 
always at stake!
Many faces of how 
CyberWar is perceived...
From McAfee’s “Virtual Criminology Report 2009”

“countries developing advanced offensive cyber capabilities”
We’ll focus on current players:
US
Russia
China
Israel
Iran
And no, here size does NOT matter...
USA
Thoroughly documented activity around cyberwar 
preparedness as well as military/government agencies 
with readily available offensive capabilities
Massive recruiting of professional in attack/defense for 
different departments:
USCC (United States Cyber Command - includes 
AirForce, Marines, Navy and Army service components)
NSA
Other TLA’s...
Russia
GRU (Main Intelligence Directorate of the Russian 
Armed Forces)
SVR (Foreign Intelligence Service)
FSB (Federal Security Services)
Center for Research of Military Strength of Foreign 
Countries
Several “National Youth Associations” (Nashi)
China
PLA (People’s Liberation Army)
Homework: read the Northrop Grumman report...
General Staff Department 4th Department - 
Electronic Countermeasures == Offense
GSD 3rd Department - Signals Intelligence == 
Defense
Yes... Titan Rain...
Iran
Telecommunications Infrastructure co.
Government telecom monopoly
Iranian Armed Forces
Israel
This is going to be very boring... Google data only :-(
IDF (Israel Defense Forces) add cyber-attack capabilities.
C4I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers 
and Intelligence) branches in Intelligence and Air-Force 
commands
Stafﬁng is mostly homegrown - trained in the army and 
other government agencies.
Mossad? (check out the jobs section on mossad.gov.il...)
CyberWar - Attack
Highly selective targeting 
of military (and critical) 
resources
In conjunction with a 
kinetic attack
OR
Massive DDOS in order to 
“black-out” a region, 
disrupt services, and/or 
push political agenda 
(propaganda)
CyberWar - Defense
Never just military
Targets will be civilian
Physical and logical protections = 
last survival act
Availability and Integrity of 
services
Can manifest in the cost of 
making services unavailable for 
most civilians

CyberCrime - Attack
Channels: web, mail, open services
Targeted attacks on premium resources
Commissioned, or for extortion purposes
Carpet bombing for most attacks
Segmenting geographical regions and market 
segments
Secondary infections through controlled outposts
Bots, infected sites
CyberCrime - target location

CyberCrime - Ammunition

How do these connect?
Claim: CyberCrime is being used to 
conduct CyberWar
Proof: Let’s start with some history...
History - Revisited...
Estonia
You read all about it.
Bottom line: civilian infrastructure was targeted
Attacks originated mostly from civilian networks

Remember Georgia?
Started by picking on the president...
Then the C&C used to control the botnet was shut 
down as:
Troops cross the border towards Georgia
A few days of silence...
flood http www.president.gov.ge 
flood tcp www.president.gov.ge 
flood icmp www.president.gov.ge
Georgia - cont.
Six (6) new C&C servers came up and drove attacks at 
additional Georgian sites
BUT - the same C&C’s were also used for attacks on 
commercial sites in order to extort them (botnet-for-
hire)

History - Revisited...
Iran
2009 Twitter DNS hack attributed to Iranian 
activity.
Political connections are too obvious to ignore 
(elections)
UN Council 
Decisions
Protests by 
leadership 
opposition in 
Tehran
Timing was right on:
Iran-Twitter connecting dots
Twitter taken down December 18th 2009
Attack attributed eventually to cyber-crime/vigilante 
group named “Iranian Cyber Army”
Until December 2009 there was no group known as 
“Iranian Cyber Army”...
BUT - “Ashiyane” (Shiite group) is from the same place 
as the “Iranian Cyber Army”
Iran-Twitter - Ashiyane
Ashiyane was using the same pro-Hezbolla messages 
that were used on the Twitter attack with their own 
attacks for some time...
AND the “Iranian Cyber Army” seems to be a pretty 
active group on the Ashiyane forums 
www.ashiyane.com/forum 
Let’s take a look at how Ashiyane operates...

Great Chinese Firewall doing an OK job in keeping 
information out.
Proving grounds for many cyber-attackers
Bulletpfoof hosting (after RBN temporary closure in 
2008 China provided an alternative that stayed...)
China
China 	 	... connecting the dots
January 12th - Google announces it was hacked by 
China
Not as in the “we lost a few minutes of DNS” 
hacked...
“In mid-December we detected a highly 
sophisticated and targeted attack on our 
corporate infrastructure originating from China that 
resulted in the theft of intellectual property from 
Google” (David Drummond, SVP @Google)
China 	 	... connecting the dots.
January 12th - Adobe gets hacked. By China.
“Adobe became aware on January 2, 2010 of a 
computer security incident involving a 
sophisticated coordinated attack against 
corporate network systems managed by Adobe 
and other companies” (Adobe ofﬁcial blog)
Same MO: 0-day in Internet Explorer to 
get into Google, Adobe and more than 40 
additional companies
China 	 	... connecting the dots..
The only problem so far - the attacks all have the sign 
of a CyberCrime attack. All the evidence points to 
known crime groups so far.
“It was an attack on the technology infrastructure of 
major corporations in sectors as diverse as ﬁnance, 
technology, media, and chemical” (Google 
enterprise blog)
China 	 	... connecting the dots...
Criminal groups attack companies in order to get to 
their data so they can sell it (whether it was commercial 
or government data!)
US Response: “We look to the Chinese government for 
an explanation. The ability to operate with conﬁdence in 
cyberspace is critical in a modern society and 
economy.” (Hillary Clinton, Secretary of State)
China 	 	... connecting the dots....
The China move:
Use of criminal groups to carry out the attacks 
provides the perfect deniability on espionage 
connections (just like in the past, and a perfect 
response to clinton).
Targets are major US companies with strategic 
poise to enable state interest espionage
Information sharing at its best:
Win - Win
State              Crime
The Future (Ilustrated)
CLOUDS
Summary
Good
Bad
Formal training on 
cybersecurity by 
nations
Commercial 
development of 
malware still reigns
Ugly
Good meet Bad: money changes hands, 
less tracks to cover, criminal ops already 
creating the weapons...
Summary
The Future
Lack of legislation and cooperation on multi-
national level is creating de-facto “safe 
haven” for cybercrime. <- FIx this!
Treaties and anti-crime activities may prove to 
be beneficial. <- nukes?
Thanks!
