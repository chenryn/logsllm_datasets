## Expected Behavior
When opening a Menu and creating a react portal, the portal that's created
should reference the `Node.ownerDocument` of the `anchorEl` or something
similar, to support rendering Material-UI components in a new window (such as
through a library like react-popout)
## Current Behavior
The portal that is created always uses the global `document` object to append
a portal div to. See: https://github.com/callemall/material-
ui/blob/08fae8c2fcd741c01cabbee38305d5ef109acfd5/src/internal/Portal.js#L45-L55
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
A simple example can be seen here: https://codesandbox.io/s/v09qklqkj7. You
can ignore the lack of styling and what not in the popout window, just trying
to show the portal issue.
