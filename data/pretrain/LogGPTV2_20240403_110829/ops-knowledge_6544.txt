User: I am trying to install and run successfully Bloomberg API Python 3.5.5 and I have also downloaded and unpacked C++ library 3.8.1.1., both for the Mac OS X.  I'm running Mac OS X 10.10.2.  I am using the Python native to Mac OS X, Python 2.7.6 and I had already installed, via Xcode, the Command line gcc compiler, GCC 4.2.1.
I did, on an administrator account, sudo python setup.py install. I also had changed the setup.py ENVIRONMENT variable BLPAPI_ROOT to the directory for the C++ headers, blpapi_cpp_3.8.1.1. The setup was successful. 
I changed to another directory as suggested by the Python's README file, to avoid 'Import Error: No module named _internals'.  
When I go to python and enter the command import blpapi, I obtain the following error:



import blpapi
      Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "", line 1, in 
        File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/blpapi/init.py", line 5, in 
          from .internals import CorrelationId
        File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/blpapi/internals.py", line 50, in 
          _internals = swig_import_helper()
        File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/blpapi/internals.py", line 46, in swig_import_helper
          _mod = imp.load_module('_internals', fp, pathname, description)
      ImportError: dlopen(/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/blpapi/_internals.so, 2): Library not loaded: libblpapi3_64.so
        Referenced from: /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/blpapi/_internals.so
        Reason: image not found



I check the directory for /Library/Python.../blpapi/ and there is no _internals.so only *.py files.  Is that the problem? I don't know how to proceed.
Assistant: There is a missing step in the Python SDK README file; it instructs you to set BLPAPI_ROOT in order to build the API wrapper, but this doesn't provide the information needed at runtime to be able to load it.
If you unpacked the C/C++ SDK into '/home/foo/blpapi-sdk' (for example), you will need to set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to allow the runtime dynamic linker to locate the BLPAPI library. This can be done as so:
$ export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/foo/blpapi-sdk/Darwin
