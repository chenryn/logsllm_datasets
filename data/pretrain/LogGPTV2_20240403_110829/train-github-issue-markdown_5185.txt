### Current Behavior:
If a non-namespaced package is published with  
`npm publish --access restricted`
npm ignored the user directive that access should be restricted and publishes
the package.
### Expected Behavior:
Attempting to publish a package which isn't namespaced with `npm publish
--access restricted` should
  1. warn the user that packages without namespaces cannot be given restricted access
  2. exit with an error
### Steps To Reproduce:
  1. Create a non-namespaces NPM package
  2. Publish is using `npm publish --access restricted`
