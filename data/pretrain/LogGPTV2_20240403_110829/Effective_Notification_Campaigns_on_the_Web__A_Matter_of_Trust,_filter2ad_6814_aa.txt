Abstract
Misconﬁgurations and outdated software are a major cause of
compromised websites and data leaks. Past research has pro-
posed and evaluated sending automated security notiﬁcations
to the operators of misconﬁgured websites, but encountered
issues with reachability, mistrust, and a perceived lack of
importance. In this paper, we seek to understand the determi-
nants of effective notiﬁcations. We identify a data protection
misconﬁguration that affects 12.7 % of the 1.3 million web-
sites we scanned and opens them up to legal liability. Using a
subset of 4754 websites, we conduct a multivariate random-
ized controlled notiﬁcation experiment, evaluating contact
medium, sender, and framing of the message. We also include
a link to a public web-based self-service tool that is run by us
in disguise and conduct an anonymous survey of the notiﬁed
website owners (N=477) to understand their perspective.
We ﬁnd that framing a misconﬁguration as a problem of
legal compliance can increase remediation rates, especially
when the notiﬁcation is sent as a letter from a legal research
group, achieving remediation rates of 76.3 % compared to
33.9 % for emails sent by computer science researchers warn-
ing about a privacy issue. Across all groups, 56.6 % of notiﬁed
owners remediated the issue, compared to 9.2 % in the control
group. In conclusion, we present factors that lead website
owners to trust a notiﬁcation, show what framing of the notiﬁ-
cation brings them into action, and how they can be supported
in remediating the issue.
1 Introduction
Maintaining a website has become a complex endeavor that
requires keeping software up to date and adapting conﬁgura-
tions to changing technical requirements. It is thus inevitable
that some systems will not be updated in time, leading to vul-
nerabilities and data breaches like the Equifax breach, traced
back to a missing software update [17], or the Exactis leak,
which was caused by a misconﬁgured ElasticSearch instance
[9]. Such breaches routinely violate the privacy of millions of
people and can cost companies millions of dollars in remedia-
tion costs, settlements, and regulatory ﬁnes [3].
Past research has evaluated the possibility of sending auto-
mated notiﬁcations to system operators to inform them about
insecure [21, 31, 38, 39], compromised [11, 12, 14, 15, 43],
or misconﬁgured [13, 29, 30, 45] systems under their control.
Such attempts achieved an improvement in remediation com-
pared to a control group, but often found large numbers of
systems to remain unﬁxed.
These studies found varied and in some cases contradictory
results on the determinants of successful notiﬁcations. We
seek to shed light on factors that inﬂuence the success of a
notiﬁcation. In particular, we consider the following research
questions: (1) What inﬂuence do various factors of notiﬁca-
tions, such as the contact medium, the sender, and the framing
of the problem, have on remediation? (2) Which forms of sup-
port are desired and embraced by website owners? (3) What
properties of a notiﬁcation message lead site owners to trust
or distrust it?
As the subject of our notiﬁcations, we search for a mis-
conﬁguration that (a) results in non-compliance with legal
obligations, (b) exposes website owners to an immediate ﬁ-
nancial risk, (c) can be automatically and unambiguously
detected upon visiting a site, and (d) is straightforward to
ﬁx. These requirements are met when website owners use the
third-party service Google Analytics (GA) in Germany but fail
to turn on the IP Anonymization feature. Both Google and the
supervisory authorities place the responsibility of enabling IP
Anonymization with the site owners. A German court has re-
cently convicted a site owner, who failed to enable this feature,
on grounds of violating personal privacy rights [5]. Choosing
a compliance misconﬁguration instead of a security vulner-
ability ensures that the notiﬁcation is equally relevant to all
website owners. Unlike outdated software, which sometimes
cannot be updated due to compatibility issues, there is also
no incentive not to remediate.
Our scans identiﬁed this misconﬁguration on 12.7 % of
the approximately 1.3 million German websites we analyzed.
We conduct a notiﬁcation experiment with a subset of 4594

site owners operating 4754 distinct non-compliant websites,
for which we collect contact information manually. We send
notiﬁcations via email or letter, using three different senders
and three distinct framings. The notiﬁcation contains a link
to a public self-service tool that we run in disguise to enable
site owners to verify if the problem has been resolved. We
also support owners via phone and email. Finally, after two
months and one reminder, we send a debrieﬁng message and
invite all notiﬁed owners to answer a short survey to gain an
understanding of their perception of the notiﬁcation message.
In summary, our paper makes the following contributions:
• We scan for a common misconﬁguration, which can be
framed as a compliance issue as described in Section 3.
This misconﬁguration allows us to design a covert ran-
domized controlled notiﬁcation experiment to evaluate
the effect of three factors on remediation in Section 4.
• We report on the results of our notiﬁcations in Section 5,
ﬁnding high remediation rates between 33.9 and 76.3 %,
with the control group at 9.2 %. We observed a high
demand for the support mechanisms we provide, in par-
ticular for our self-service tool.
• We describe the responses collected in our survey (N =
477) in Section 6, ﬁnding that missing awareness is
widespread. 19.5 % of site owners admitted not even
knowing that their site was running GA.
• We highlight important takeaways from our study, in par-
ticular the large effect of framing misconﬁgurations as an
issue of compliance with legal obligations in Section 7.
2 Related Work
We review previous research in the area of vulnerability notiﬁ-
cations and the perspectives of system operators and owners.
2.1 Effectiveness of Notiﬁcations
The effectiveness of notiﬁcations was evaluated in several ar-
eas, ranging from the security of websites [11, 12, 21, 31,
38, 39, 43, 45] or DNS servers [13] to DDoS ampliﬁers
[15, 29, 30] and end-user malware infections [14], with stud-
ies usually ﬁnding an increase in remediation rates compared
to a control group. The studies commonly sent emails to
WHOIS or abuse contacts, or to common aliases (RFC 2142),
with some using intermediaries such as CERTs and clear-
inghouses [13, 29, 30, 38]. Some studies also worked with
Google [30, 31, 45] or Internet Service Providers (ISPs) us-
ing quarantine networks with captive portals [12, 15] to de-
liver their messages. Stock et al. performed a smaller-scale
experiment with manually collected email addresses, postal
addresses, phone numbers, and social media contacts [39],
ﬁnding that these channels can sometimes outperform oth-
ers. However, the low number of messages (N = 364 spread
over 10 groups) and potential priming and self-selection ef-
fects in this experiment make it impossible to draw general
conclusions.
Studies frequently encountered issues with notiﬁcation de-
livery [12, 13, 21, 30, 38, 39], observing email bounce rates
of over 50 % [12, 13, 38] in some cases due to incorrect in-
formation in WHOIS records or the lack of standard email
aliases such as webmaster@domain.com. Additional issues in
delivery were caused by spam ﬁlters [38, 39]. Recipients were
often wary of unsolicited emails and suspected them to be
spam or scam messages [14, 15, 39, 45], sometimes reaching
out to verify the veracity of the message before acting upon it
[14, 15]. This suggests that trust in the sender could play an
important role in the success of notiﬁcations. However, other
studies did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant differences between different
senders [12, 45], leaving this question unresolved.
Several studies showed that more comprehensive messages
increase remediation rates [12, 30, 43] and trust in the mes-
sage [39]. Recipients often desired a tool to verify the veracity
of the provided information and effectiveness of their reme-
diation [13, 31, 45], although the actual effect of providing
such a tool was small [13]. The results for repeated notiﬁca-
tions of unﬁxed websites are inconclusive as well, showing
no effects in a study conducted by Li et al. [30], while Stock
et al. observed a small effect [38].
An area where notices are arguably followed too well is in
copyright enforcement, where the ﬁnancial risks surrounding
the notice and takedown scheme have led to overblocking and
incorrect claims [35, 41]. This highlights the potential impact
the legal incentives surrounding a notiﬁcation can have.
In contrast to existing work, we seek to study alternative
delivery channels and senders in more detail and investigate
the effect of using a compliance argument to provide an in-
centive for remediation that is independent of circumstances,
as it applies equally to every website.
2.2 Website Owners Perspective
With our notiﬁcation, we explicitly addressed the owners in
contrast to previous work that wrote to operators, as they are
legally responsible for the operation of the website and thus
the correct point of contact for a compliance issue. The owner
can also be the one to operate the system, which is why in the
following, we also refer to the literature on system operators.
While there is quite a lot of research regarding the developers’
perspective on privacy (e. g. [10, 23, 37, 42]), and some about
system operators [8, 19], relatively little research into website
owners exists so far [22]. Similar to software developers [44],
system operators play a critical role when it comes to protect-
ing end-users privacy and security [8]. This may also be true
for website owners since they are making decisions regarding
speciﬁc privacy policies and their implementation [22].

Research about whether or not system operators and web-
site owners are aware of security and privacy gaps is ambigu-
ous. Many consumer and small business site owners are not
aware that their sites are threatened [6]. In the notiﬁcation
study by Li et al. [30], 46 % of the participants stated that they
were aware of their vulnerability before notiﬁcation, while
Durumeric et al. [21] reported that all 17 participants were al-
ready aware of the problem. Even if the operators were aware,
they did not necessarily solve the problem in these studies,
which was also concluded by Stock et al. [39].
This brings us to the question of how system operators
or website owners handle security and privacy issues. Many
studies pick one speciﬁc aspect, e.g., the usability of HTTPS
deployment [28], operator’s procedures for handling software
updates [16, 25, 32], their perception of the trustworthiness of
TLS certiﬁcates [40], and their perspectives on TLS misconﬁg-
urations [19]. Indications on the system operators’ problem-
solving behavior are shown by Li et al. [32], who describe
system operators’ processes for software updates with a ﬁve-
step model. Dietrich et al. [19] conducted a study on the per-
spective of system operators on misconﬁgurations and found
that social, structural, and institutional factors, in particular,
can promote a bad security posture [19].
To deepen the understanding of website owners’ perspec-
tive on privacy, we investigate the owners’ reaction to notiﬁ-
cations that address a privacy issue. We focus on the website
owners’ awareness, their perception of the notiﬁcation, and
their problem-solving behavior, as well as support aspects.
3 Background
We explain the technical and legal aspects of IP Anonymiza-
tion in Google Analytics (GA) in Germany, which provides
the basis for our notiﬁcation experiment.
3.1 Technical Background
GA uses a JavaScript library that has to be included in the web-
site by the website’s owner. The owner creates one or more
tracker objects with their tracking IDs and adds a method
call that issues an HTTP request to Google’s Analytics ser-
vice. Optionally, the owner can set conﬁguration options on
the tracker objects, including IP Anonymization [4]. When
enabling IP Anonymization, the HTTP request contains a pa-
rameter aip=1, which instructs Google to truncate the website
users’ IP address before storing it for analytical purposes. For
IPv4 addresses, the last octet is set to zero, while for IPv6
addresses, the last 80 bits are changed into zeros. Conﬁguring
IP Anonymization in GA is error-prone (see Appendix A3).
The effect of IP Anonymization on real-world privacy is
limited. However, choosing this issue for our study has three
beneﬁts: it is under the exclusive control of the website oper-
ator, can be irrefutably detected remotely, and forms a data
protection law violation, which we will discuss next.
3.2 Legal Background
The requirement to use IP Anonymization results from the Eu-
ropean General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [7], and
has recently been conﬁrmed in a German sub-court decision
[5]. The court ruled that omitting IP Anonymization infringes
on the data protection principles of data minimization and
storage limitation as well as the non-use of pseudonymization
and anonymization techniques. Enforcement usually falls to
the data protection supervisory authorities, which share this
interpretation of the law. While it has not yet been conﬁrmed
by a higher court, it at least indicates that non-compliant web-
site operators are at risk of a lawsuit.
German competition law also allows for competitors of the
owners of a non-compliant website to send a written warn-
ing with costs (“Abmahnung”), a practice that has seen some
misuse in the past. This has led to media attention and fears
that the new data protection legislation would result in a wave
of such warnings. While no large number of such cases have
appeared so far, many website owners are nevertheless aware
of the risk and thus especially sensitive to the topic of GDPR
compliance. Website owners bear joint responsibility for the
data protection practices of any third-party content they load
into their website [1], thus placing any detected GA code
within their legal responsibility. This makes the issue par-
ticularly suitable for evaluating the effects of citing legal
requirements in notiﬁcations.
Another aspect of the German legal system makes it par-
ticularly suitable for notiﬁcation studies: an imprint with up-
to-date contact information is legally mandated for almost all
website owners. While not machine-readable, this improves
the chance to identify a point of contact for the website.
4 Methodology
We describe how we collect misconﬁgured websites, the ex-
perimental groups, our notiﬁcation strategy, and how we sup-
ported website owners. We then present the survey, the steps
of data cleaning and analysis, and ethical aspects. Figure 1
summarizes our methodology.
4.1 Compliance Checker
To ﬁnd misconﬁgured websites, i. e., German sites without IP
Anonymization, and to support site owners in verifying the
correct implementation of IP Anonymization (cf. Section 4.4),
we implement a compliance checker. Our compliance checker
is based on the Chromium browser and utilizes the Chrome
DevTools protocol [2]. It extracts all HTTP requests to GA
and checks for the existence of the aip=1 parameter, regard-
less of the request being issued by the website itself or by
a third party. Besides HTTP requests, the checker reads all
