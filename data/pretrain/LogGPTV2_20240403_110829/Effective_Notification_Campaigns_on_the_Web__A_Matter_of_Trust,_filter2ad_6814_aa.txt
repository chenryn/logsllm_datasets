**Abstract:**
Misconfigurations and outdated software are significant contributors to compromised websites and data breaches. Previous research has explored sending automated security notifications to website operators but has encountered challenges with reachability, trust, and perceived importance. This paper aims to identify the key factors that make notifications effective. We focus on a data protection misconfiguration affecting 12.7% of 1.3 million scanned websites, which exposes them to legal liability. Using a subset of 4,754 websites, we conduct a multivariate randomized controlled experiment, evaluating the impact of contact medium, sender, and message framing. Additionally, we provide a link to a public, self-service tool and conduct an anonymous survey of notified website owners (N=477) to understand their perspectives.

Our findings indicate that framing a misconfiguration as a legal compliance issue significantly increases remediation rates, especially when the notification is sent as a letter from a legal research group, achieving a 76.3% remediation rate compared to 33.9% for emails from computer science researchers warning about a privacy issue. Across all groups, 56.6% of notified owners remediated the issue, compared to 9.2% in the control group. In conclusion, we present factors that lead website owners to trust a notification, show what framing motivates action, and how they can be supported in remediating the issue.

## 1. Introduction
Maintaining a website involves keeping software up-to-date and adapting configurations to evolving technical requirements. Consequently, some systems may not be updated in time, leading to vulnerabilities and data breaches. Examples include the Equifax breach, caused by a missing software update, and the Exactis leak, due to a misconfigured ElasticSearch instance. Such breaches often violate the privacy of millions of people and can result in substantial financial costs for companies.

Previous research has evaluated the effectiveness of sending automated notifications to system operators to inform them about insecure, compromised, or misconfigured systems. While these efforts have shown some improvement in remediation rates, many systems remain unaddressed. The studies have yielded varied and sometimes contradictory results on the determinants of successful notifications.

This paper aims to shed light on the factors influencing the success of notifications. Specifically, we address the following research questions:
1. What influence do various factors of notifications, such as the contact medium, the sender, and the framing of the problem, have on remediation?
2. Which forms of support are desired and embraced by website owners?
3. What properties of a notification message lead site owners to trust or distrust it?

We focus on a misconfiguration that (a) results in non-compliance with legal obligations, (b) exposes website owners to immediate financial risk, (c) can be automatically and unambiguously detected, and (d) is straightforward to fix. This misconfiguration occurs when website owners use Google Analytics (GA) in Germany without enabling the IP Anonymization feature. Both Google and supervisory authorities place the responsibility of enabling IP Anonymization with the site owners. A recent German court decision convicted a site owner for violating personal privacy rights by failing to enable this feature.

Our scans identified this misconfiguration on 12.7% of approximately 1.3 million German websites. We conducted a notification experiment with a subset of 4,754 distinct non-compliant websites, collecting contact information manually. We sent notifications via email or letter, using three different senders and three distinct framings. The notification included a link to a public self-service tool, run in disguise, to help site owners verify if the problem was resolved. We also provided support via phone and email. After two months and one reminder, we sent a debriefing message and invited all notified owners to complete a short survey to gain insight into their perceptions of the notification.

In summary, our paper makes the following contributions:
- We scan for a common misconfiguration, which can be framed as a compliance issue.
- We design a covert randomized controlled notification experiment to evaluate the effect of three factors on remediation.
- We report high remediation rates between 33.9% and 76.3%, with the control group at 9.2%. We observed a high demand for the support mechanisms, particularly for our self-service tool.
- We describe the responses collected in our survey (N = 477), finding that missing awareness is widespread. 19.5% of site owners admitted not even knowing that their site was running GA.
- We highlight important takeaways, particularly the large effect of framing misconfigurations as a legal compliance issue.

### 2.1 Effectiveness of Notifications
Several studies have evaluated the effectiveness of notifications in areas ranging from website security to end-user malware infections. These studies generally found an increase in remediation rates compared to control groups. Common delivery methods include emails to WHOIS or abuse contacts, or through intermediaries like CERTs and clearinghouses. Some studies used additional channels, such as postal addresses and social media, with mixed results. Delivery issues, such as high email bounce rates and spam filters, were frequently encountered. Recipients often distrusted unsolicited emails, suggesting that trust in the sender is crucial. Comprehensive messages and verification tools were found to increase remediation rates, although the actual effect of providing such tools was small. Repeated notifications showed inconclusive results.

### 2.2 Website Owners' Perspective
Our notification explicitly addressed website owners, who are legally responsible for the operation of the website. Research on website owners' awareness of security and privacy gaps is limited and ambiguous. Many consumer and small business site owners are unaware of threats, and even those who are aware may not take action. Studies on system operators' problem-solving behavior suggest that social, structural, and institutional factors can promote poor security practices. To deepen our understanding, we investigate website owners' reactions to notifications addressing a privacy issue, focusing on their awareness, perception, and problem-solving behavior, as well as support aspects.

## 3. Background
### 3.1 Technical Background
Google Analytics (GA) uses a JavaScript library that must be included in the website by the owner. The owner creates tracker objects with tracking IDs and adds a method call that sends an HTTP request to Google's Analytics service. Optionally, the owner can set configuration options, including IP Anonymization. When enabled, the HTTP request includes a parameter `aip=1`, instructing Google to truncate the user's IP address before storing it. For IPv4, the last octet is set to zero, and for IPv6, the last 80 bits are changed to zeros. Configuring IP Anonymization in GA is error-prone.

While the real-world privacy impact of IP Anonymization is limited, choosing this issue for our study has three benefits: it is under the exclusive control of the website operator, can be irrefutably detected remotely, and forms a data protection law violation.

### 3.2 Legal Background
The requirement for IP Anonymization stems from the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and has been confirmed in a German sub-court decision. Omitting IP Anonymization infringes on data minimization and storage limitation principles, as well as the non-use of pseudonymization and anonymization techniques. Enforcement typically falls to data protection supervisory authorities. Non-compliant website operators are at risk of lawsuits. German competition law also allows competitors to send written warnings, which has led to increased awareness and sensitivity among website owners regarding GDPR compliance. Website owners bear joint responsibility for the data protection practices of any third-party content on their sites, making this issue suitable for evaluating the effects of citing legal requirements in notifications.

## 4. Methodology
### 4.1 Compliance Checker
To find misconfigured websites and support site owners in verifying the correct implementation of IP Anonymization, we implemented a compliance checker based on the Chromium browser and utilizing the Chrome DevTools protocol. The checker extracts all HTTP requests to GA and checks for the existence of the `aip=1` parameter, regardless of whether the request is issued by the website itself or a third party. Besides HTTP requests, the checker reads all relevant data to ensure accurate detection and verification.
