### Project Manager Responsibilities
The Project Manager must effectively balance and influence the competing project constraints of scope, quality, schedule, budget, resources, and risks. They serve as the communication link between the Project Sponsor and the project team, ensuring that all parties are aligned and informed. The Project Manager also facilitates effective communication between the project team and business representatives involved in the project.

### Project Sponsor
The Project Sponsor is a critical role with the authority to decide whether a project should be undertaken, provide funding, allocate resources, and support the project. If necessary, they have the power to cancel the project. The Project Sponsor ensures that the needs of the business area are clearly and timely communicated. By reviewing and approving project documents and conducting regular progress reviews, the Project Sponsor ensures that the system design meets all business goals. They are also responsible for ensuring that adequate financial and business process resources are available in a timely manner to address business needs. The Project Sponsor is expected to actively lead project teams in addressing risks and resolving issues throughout the project lifecycle. They may also act as the senior spokesperson for the project, communicating strategic vision and project status both internally to the project team and externally to other stakeholders.

### Project Team
A project team consists of members from different groups or functions, all assigned to activities for the same project. The team can be divided into sub-teams as needed and is typically used for a defined period of time.

### Stakeholder
A stakeholder is an individual or organization that can influence a project or be affected by it. This term is broad and includes not only project team members but also any individuals impacted by changes brought about by the project. Stakeholders typically include various units within the sponsoring organization, such as the budget office, IT division, and Human Resources. They also include interface partners and potential users of the project's product, whether they are part of the sponsoring organization or external (e.g., other branches of state government, federal and local governments). Stakeholders also include control agencies that review project details and those who review and approve aspects of the business processes that may be modified during the project (e.g., the State Controller approving payment processes). The Legislature, which may be asked to approve project funding, is also a stakeholder. Public sector project stakeholders include taxpayers, who have a vested interest in the effective use of public funds and the state’s ability to manage projects and tax dollars efficiently. Project teams benefit from categorizing stakeholders, such as internal or external, members of the project team, or members of the public. Identifying stakeholders with significant influence over the project or those significantly affected by it is particularly helpful.

### Stakeholder Group Representative(s)
Stakeholder Group Representatives act as liaisons between the Organizational Change Management (OCM) Practitioner, the project team, and their represented stakeholder population. They gather information about stakeholder priorities, needs, and requirements, communicate project information to stakeholders, and identify any signs of resistance.

### Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)
Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) provide the project team with detailed knowledge of business operations, financial controls, current database history and structure, and other aspects of the business processes related to the project. SMEs are often brought in as needed during requirements definition, design sessions, validation of design, or at various stages of testing. In more iterative project development, SMEs may be closely engaged throughout the development process.

### Super User(s)
Super Users, while generally serving as first-level support for end users, can also serve as role models for the larger population of stakeholders. This role provides a positive example for stakeholders to follow and replicate. Super Users need to demonstrate certain behaviors to be effective as role models.

### OCM Terms

#### Alternative
Different solutions and approaches that must be evaluated and potentially selected to achieve the objectives of a project.

#### Alternatives Analysis
A process of breaking down a complex situation to generate different solutions and approaches, evaluating the impact of trade-offs.

#### Business Process Reengineering (BPR)
The purpose of BPR is to help prepare users for the new or modified automated system being developed. It focuses on understanding and documenting current processes and business needs, identifying where automation can help, and assisting users in modifying or using new processes that incorporate the automated system functionality. The goals of BPR are to streamline existing processes, ensure the correct processes are being automated, and ensure automation addresses the process needs. This does not mean the elimination of all manual processes; some new processes may be a combination of manual and automated activities. Organizational change or re-design may be part of the effort.

#### Buy-in

#### Change Management
The process by which the people-related issues and priorities of a change initiative are identified, assessed, and addressed.

#### Closing Process Phase
In this phase, the OCM practitioner concludes the effort by measuring the effectiveness of activities and making final adjustments and course corrections as necessary. The OCM effort is accepted and transferred to the support organization. This phase also provides the opportunity to assess the project, develop lessons learned, and recommend practices for future projects. Completion of all closing activities signifies the formal end of project work.

#### Communication Channels
Different ways of disseminating and collecting information across an organization. A variety of communication channels should be utilized to increase the flow of information and garner increased change support.

#### Communication Knowledge Area
One of the CA-OCM’s six knowledge areas, Communication creates awareness and understanding to obtain stakeholder buy-in and reduce employees’ resistance to change. All communication elements should be carefully considered to inform and engage employees and stakeholders.

#### Concept Process Phase
In this phase, the change initiative is outlined for key leaders and stakeholders before the project is formally initiated. Long-term project success requires a common understanding of the change, combined with the ability to confront challenges during the project. The OCM practitioner assists in developing this common understanding by defining the change and communicating it to key leaders and stakeholders.

#### Constraint
A limiting factor that affects the execution of a project, program, portfolio, or process. Constraints can involve the availability, assignment, or use of project cost, schedule, or resources, and can limit the project team’s options, leading to pressure and frustrations among team members.

#### Engagement
Active, open dialog between a project team and stakeholders, involving communication of plans and status and elicitation of feedback.

#### Environmental Readiness Assessment
This assessment evaluates the level of willingness and preparation of an organization to adopt changes or undertake an effort, based on an analysis of environmental factors.

#### Executing Process Phase
In this phase, the OCM practitioner executes the activities and tasks identified in previous phases. They utilize strategic thinking, effective communication, people skills, and integration skills to enroll leadership support, engage stakeholders, perform training and workforce transition activities, and continue communication and feedback activities regarding the initiative.

#### Feedback Channels or Mechanisms
Different ways of collecting information, feedback, and questions from stakeholders. A variety of feedback channels/mechanisms should be utilized to increase the flow of information and garner increased change support.

#### Functional Requirements
Characteristics of the deliverable, described in ordinary, non-technical language that is understandable to the customer.

#### Future State
Also known as “to-be,” the future state is a model of the future structure, such as processes, data, applications, and technology.

#### Initiating Process Phase
In this phase, the creation of a solid change foundation reduces project risk and increases the likelihood of overall success. The OCM Practitioner determines OCM priorities and potential issues based on the project’s nature, size, scope, and complexities. They also continue to communicate key messages to keep stakeholders informed, mitigate risks, and gather feedback.

#### Inputs
Information and/or documents that feed into a process. Inputs may include outputs from other frameworks, such as the CA-BPR and the CA-PMF, other process phases, or other knowledge areas.

#### Knowledge Area
Organized groupings of related OCM activities that share a common objective and purpose. Activities from multiple knowledge areas occur within a single process phase. OCM’s six knowledge areas include OCM Lifecycle Management, Communication, Leadership Support, Team Dynamics, Stakeholder Enrollment, and Training.

#### Knowledge Transfer
The flow of knowledge, skills, information, and competencies from one person to another. This can happen through various methods, including coaching, mentoring, training courses, and on-the-job experience. Knowledge transfer is crucial, especially at the end of a project when a contractor or development staff hands off a new system to state employees who will operate and maintain it daily.

#### Leadership Engagement
The process of engaging leaders in a change initiative, moving them through the process of understanding, accepting, and embracing the change.

#### Leadership Readiness
Refers to a leader’s level of engagement in the change initiative. Leaders with high readiness embrace the initiative and are prepared to move forward with all phases of the project. Leaders with low readiness may experience resistance and lack support for the change.

#### Leadership Support Knowledge Area
One of the CA-OCM’s six knowledge areas, Leadership Support increases leadership involvement and support for change initiatives. Leadership support should be visible to employees, as leaders shape and create the organization’s attitude toward change. Understanding leadership is imperative to understanding the organization’s culture and providing a lever for changing the culture. Leaders reinforce the organization’s attitude toward change through their behavior and style. Employees look to their organization’s leaders at all levels to accept and engage in the change effort. Providing leadership with information about their organization’s culture and attitude toward change is a useful way for them to become aware of their impact on the organization and the change effort.

#### Lessons Learned
Knowledge gained during a project, showing how project events were addressed or should be addressed in the future to improve performance. Documented experiences can be used to improve the future management of projects.

#### Milestone

#### OCM Lifecycle Management Knowledge Area
One of the CA-OCM’s six knowledge areas, OCM Lifecycle Management plans, defines, and manages the activities necessary to transition the organization and its people to a future state. The activities in this knowledge area govern the performance of all other knowledge area activities and guide management activities specific to OCM. OCM Lifecycle Management provides the tools necessary for the OCM Practitioner to manage the OCM effort throughout the project and identify areas that can be customized within the OCM effort.

#### Organizational Change Management (OCM)
A structured approach to shifting or transitioning an organization from the current state to a desired future state. OCM applies a set of tools, processes, skills, and principles for managing the people side of change to achieve the desired organizational change. It empowers employees to accept and embrace changes in their business environment. OCM is frequently required during a project and/or upon implementation of the project’s product or other end result.

#### Output
The tangible or intangible product typically delivered by a project.

#### Planning Process Phase
This phase addresses the organization, preparation, definition, and refinement of how the project and related OCM efforts will be executed and monitored. The Planning Process Phase helps guide the successful completion of essential OCM planning activities. The OCM Practitioner will define and refine the OCM and training objectives, develop knowledge area strategies, plans, activities, and tasks to attain those objectives, and establish methods for measuring their effectiveness for maximum success.

#### Preferred Senders
In communication, the message disseminators that are most suitable to communicate certain messages. Preferred senders vary due to audience groups, message content, timing, and delivery channel.

#### Process Phase
A collection of logically related project activities that culminate in the completion of one or more deliverables. (The California Project Management Framework (CA-PMF) describes each of the five process phases: Concept, Initiating, Planning, Executing, and Closing.)

#### Project Approval Lifecycle (PAL)
California has adopted the PAL to improve the quality, value, and likelihood of success for technology projects undertaken by the State of California. The PAL ensures projects are undertaken with clear business objectives, accurate costs, and realistic schedules. The PAL includes various stages separated by gates specifically tailored for IT projects.
- **PAL Stage 1 – Business Analysis:** Provides a basis for project management, program management, executive management, and state-level control agencies to understand and agree on business problems or opportunities and the objectives to address them.
- **PAL Stage 2 – Alternatives Analysis:** Provides a basis for how the proposal’s business objectives will be achieved, the evaluation of multiple alternative solutions, and the determination of which alternative will yield the highest probability of meeting the business objectives. It also develops an acquisition strategy/plan for procuring services.
- **PAL Stage 3 – Solution Development:** Confirms the solution requirements needed to achieve the business objectives and develops the Request for Proposal (RFP) for the acquisition of services if needed.
- **PAL Stage 4 – Project Readiness Approval:** A Solution Project Readiness and Approval Analysis that solicits bids from vendors on how they propose to meet the business requirements of the chosen alternative approach, and where the final form of the project is approved to go forward.

#### Project Management Lifecycle (PMLC)
A series of process phases to provide better management and control over a project. During each phase, activities and tools are used to fulfill project goals or objectives. The PMLC is designed to accommodate projects that vary in size and complexity.

#### Project Management Plan (PMP)
The document that describes how the executing, monitoring, and controlling of the project will be conducted.

#### Project Vision
A statement that captures the long-term picture of what the organization or project wants to become. A vision statement typically strives to be inspirational, memorable, and reflect the desires of those with vested interests.

#### Requirement
A condition or capability that must be met or possessed by a system or system component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification, or other formally imposed documents. Requirements identify, in objective terms, the criteria used to measure project success and should be captured and approved as early as possible in the project.

#### Resistance to Change
Resistance to change refers to an individual’s natural inclination to resist changes of any kind. Resistance is often unique to each individual, varying in timing and manifestation. However, resistance to change is normal and should be expected and planned for.

#### Risk
An uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on one or more project objectives.

#### Risk Tolerance
The criteria against which stakeholders evaluate a risk. Different risk tolerances may be defined for each risk, risk category, or combination of risks. Exceeding a risk threshold is a condition that triggers some action.

#### Root-Cause Analysis
A process of identifying underlying causes of a problem through specific analytical methods, such as 5-Whys Analysis, Barrier Analysis, Change Analysis, Casual Factor Tree Analysis, Failure Mode and Effects Analysis, Fish-Bone Diagram, Pareto Analysis, and Fault Tree Analysis.

#### Scope
The totality of the outputs, outcomes, and benefits and the work required to produce them.

#### System Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
A model used in project management that describes the stages (or phases) involved in an information system development. The purpose is to meet user requirements in support of business strategic goals and objectives.

#### Stakeholder Enrollment Knowledge Area
One of the CA-OCM’s six knowledge areas, Stakeholder Enrollment engages stakeholders in a change initiative and identifies and addresses employees’ resistance to change. Stakeholders include persons or groups directly or indirectly affected by a project and those who may have the ability to influence its outcome. Stakeholder enrollment is the act of methodically introducing a change to stakeholders and obtaining their engagement and buy-in. Stakeholders form the foundation of a change, and their enrollment drives change progress. Often, stakeholders provide a mirror into the attitude and culture of an organization. Enrollment activities will identify stakeholders and guide the effort to involve them.

#### Team Building
Team building addresses intra- and intergroup competition, rigidities, and unresponsiveness within an organization. Team members are encouraged to address team dynamics problems by performing self-assessments, meeting regularly to discuss issues and celebrate successes, and holding each other accountable.

#### Team Dynamics Knowledge Area
One of the CA-OCM’s six knowledge areas, Team Dynamics creates a cohesive project team and maintains effective team dynamics. The project team needs to work harmoniously to maximize productivity and minimize issues and risks related to challenging team dynamics. As proponents of the change within an organization, the project team should be sensitive to the organization and team culture. The overall project team may consist of individuals representing different organizations, such as state and contractor employees, and different disciplines, such as project management, OCM, BPR, and technical professionals.

#### Training Knowledge Area
One of the CA-OCM’s six knowledge areas, Training provides end users with thoughtful, applicable training in preparation for their transition into the future state. A thoughtful training approach will prepare end users for their new roles by equipping them with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed. Training is a key component of project implementations and should be tailored specifically to the needs of the organization and end users. Training can be customized in content, delivery channel, and timing, among other factors.
