Project Manager must efectively balance and influence the competing project  
constraints of scope, quality, schedule, budget, resources, and risks. The Manager  
provides the communication link between the Project Sponsor and project team.  
He or she also establishes efective communication between the project team  
and business representatives participating in the project. 
Project Sponsor – This is a critical project role with the authority to decide 
whether  or  not  a  project  should  be  undertaken,  as  well  as  the  authority  to 
provide funding, resources, support for the project and to cancel the project 
if  necessary.  The  Project  Sponsor  ensures  the  needs  of  the  business  area 
are  clearly  communicated  in  a  timely  manner.  With  review  and  approval  of 
project documents and careful progress reviews, the Project Sponsor ensures 
the  design  of  the  system  meets  all  business  goals.  The  Project  Sponsor  is 
also  responsible  for  ensuring  that  adequate  financial  and  business  process 
resources are made available in a timely manner to address business needs. 
The Project Sponsor is expected to actively lead project teams to address risks 
and resolve project issues throughout the project lifecycle. He or she may act 
as  senior  spokesperson  for  the  project,  communicating  strategic  vision  and 
project status for the project both internally to the project team and externally 
to other Stakeholders. 
Project Team – A project team is a team whose members usually belong to 
diferent groups or functions, and are assigned to activities for the same project. 
A team can be divided into sub-teams according to need. Usually project teams 
are only used for a defined period of time. 
Stakeholder – A Stakeholder is an individual or organization that can influence 
a project, or can be afected by a project, in some way. “Stakeholder” is a very 
broad term that includes not only the actual project team members but also 
any individuals afected by changes brought about by the product.

Stakeholders typically include all of the separate units within the sponsoring 
organization(s)  that  have  a  role  to  play  in  conducting  or  supporting  the 
project, such as the budget shop, the IT division, and the Human Resources 
unit.  Stakeholders  also  include  interface  partners  and  potential  users  of  the 
project’s  product,  whether  they  are  part  of  the  sponsoring  organization  or 
outside  of  it  (including  other  branches  of  state  government  and  federal  and 
local government). 
Stakeholders  include  control  agencies  that  review  project  details,  and  those 
who have a role in reviewing and approving aspects of the business processes 
that  may  be  modified  during  the  course  of  the  project  (such  as  the  State 
Controller approving payment processes). The Legislature is a Stakeholder that 
may be asked to approve project funding. Public sector project Stakeholders 
include taxpayers, who have a stake in the efective use of public funds and 
an  ongoing  interest  in  the  state’s  ability  to  manage  projects  and  tax  dollars 
efectively. Project teams may benefit by categorizing Stakeholders in various 
ways,  such  as  internal  or  external,  a  member  of  the  project  team,  a  person 
within the sponsoring organization, or members of the public. Project teams 
typically find it helpful to identify Stakeholders who have significant influence 
over the project or are significantly afected by it. 
Stakeholder  Group  Representative(s)  –  Act  as  liaisons  between  the  OCM 
Practitioner,  project  team  and  their  represented  Stakeholder  population. 
They  work  to  gather  information  about  Stakeholder  priorities,  needs,  and 
requirements, communicate project information to Stakeholders, and identify 
any signs of resistance. 
Subject  Matter  Experts  (SMEs)  –  Subject  Matter  Experts  (SMEs)  provide  the  
project team with knowledge of the details of the business operation, financial  
controls,  current  database  history  and  structure,  and  other  aspects  of  the  
business processes related to the project. These experts ofen are not assigned  
full time, but they are brought in as needed during requirements definition, design  
sessions, validation of design, or at various stages of testing. In more iterative  
project development, SMEs may be closely engaged in the development process. 
Super  User(s)  –  Though  more  generally  used  as  first-level  support  for  end  
users,  Super  Users  can  also  serve  as  role  models  for  the  larger  population  of  
Stakeholders. This role provides a positive example for Stakeholders to follow  
and replicate. Super Users need to demonstrate certain behaviors in order to be  
efective as role models.

3.2  OCM Terms 
The  following  is  a  list  of  OCM  terms  that  are  widely  used  among  OCM 
Practitioners. 
Alternative – Diferent solutions and approaches that must be evaluated and 
potentially selected to attain the objectives of a project. 
Alternatives  Analysis  –  A  process  of  breaking  down  a  complex  situation  to 
generate diferent solutions and approaches in order to evaluate the impact  
of trade-ofs. 
Barriers  to  Change  –  Barriers  to  change  are  obstacles  that  may  prevent  an 
organization or its people from implementing a change. Such barriers may be 
caused by people, technology, infrastructure, and/or processes. 
Business Driver – Business drivers are external and internal forces that create 
a need for business action or “drive” the organization’s business, as well as the 
strategies that an organization defines in response to these forces. 
Business Goal – The underlying basis for which a project is undertaken. 
Business Problem – A perceived gap between the existing state and a desired state. 
Business Process Reengineering (BPR) – The purpose of Business Process Re-
engineering (BPR) is to help prepare users for the new or modified automated 
system that is being developed. The focus is on understanding and documenting 
current  processes  and  business  needs,  and  identifying  where  automation 
may help. Thereafer, the focus shifs to assisting users to modify or use new 
processes  that  incorporate  the  use  of  the  automated  system  functionality. 
Training and measuring process efectiveness are important parts of the BPR 
efort. The goals of BPR are to streamline existing processes, ensure the correct 
processes  are  being  automated,  and  ensure  automation  is  addressing  the 
process need. This does not mean the elimination of all manual processes. Some 
new processes may be a combination of manual and automated activities. In 
many cases, organizational change or re-design may be part of the efort, or it 
may be a simultaneous efort. 
Buy-in  –  An  attitude  reflective  of  agreement  with  and  commitment  to  the 
success of a project.

Organizational Change Management Framework 
California  Business  Process  Reengineering  Framework  (CA-BPR)  –  The 
California  Business  Process  Reengineering  Framework  (CA-BPR)  is  intended 
as a practical guide to help the BPR Practitioner execute, monitor, and control 
the Business Process Reengineering (BPR) efort, activities, and tasks. The BPR 
Framework focuses on Information Technology (IT) projects in particular, but is 
designed for use by BPR Practitioners across multiple industries. The objective 
of the CA-BPR is to provide BPR Practitioners with useful and practical advice 
about what they need to do to make their BPR eforts successful. 
California  Project  Management  Framework  (CA-PMF)  –  The  California 
Project Management Framework (CA-PMF) is intended as a practical guide to 
help project teams manage projects of all sizes so that they achieve expected 
outcomes. The Framework focuses on Information Technology (IT) projects in 
particular, but is designed for use by project teams across multiple industries. 
The objective of the CA-PMF is to provide project teams with useful and practical 
advice about what they need to do to make their projects successful. 
California  Organizational  Change  Management  Framework  (CA-OCM)  – 
The  California  Organizational  Change  Management  Framework  (CA-OCM)  is 
intended as a practical guide to help OCM Practitioners successfully navigate 
and influence changes brought about by the new product or system. This may 
include  training  on  the  new  system,  training  and  implementation  activities 
involving new business processes, Stakeholder outreach, and other activities 
required to successfully implement the project’s solution. 
Change Driver – Drivers of change are the factors and major trends driving the 
need to change. Change drivers align with the strategic focus and answer the 
questions ‘Why change?’ and ‘Why change now?’ 
Change  Enrollment  –  Change  enrollment 
is  the  process  of  engaging 
Stakeholders  in  a  change  initiative.  To  achieve  full  enrollment,  Stakeholders 
must move through the process of understanding, accepting, and embracing 
the change. 
Change Initiative – A change initiative is the systematic process which assesses, 
plans, and implements an IT solution. 
Change Magnitude – Qualitative or quantitative assessment of the magnitude 
of loss or gain that would be realized should a specific risk or opportunity event 
or series of interdependent events occur. 
Change  Management  –  Change  management,  or  Organizational  Change 
Management  (OCM),  is  the  process  by  which  the  people-related  issues  and 
priorities of a change initiative are identified, assessed, and addressed.

Organizational Change Management Framework 
Closing Process Phase – In the Closing Process Phase, the OCM practitioner 
concludes the efort by measuring the efectiveness of activities and making 
final  adjustments  and  course  corrections  as  necessary.  The  OCM  efort  is 
accepted  and  transferred  to  the  support  organization.  This  process  phase 
also provides the opportunity to assess the project, develop lessons learned, 
and recommended practices for future projects. The completion of all Closing 
Process Phase activities signifies the formal end of project work. 
Communication  Channels  –  Communication  channels  are  diferent  ways  of 
disseminating and collecting information across an organization. A variety of 
communication  channels  should  be  utilized  in  order  to  increase  the  flow  of 
information, and thus, garner increased change support. 
Communication  Knowledge  Area  –  One  of  the  CA-OCM’s  six  knowledge 
areas,  Communication  creates  awareness  and  understanding  in  order  to 
obtain  stakeholder  buy-in  and  reduce  employees’  resistance  to  change. 
Communication  is  much  more  complex  than  sending  an  email  or  creating  a 
newsletter.  All  communication  elements  should  be  carefully  considered  in 
order to inform and engage employees and Stakeholders. 
Concept Process Phase – In the Concept Process Phase, the change initiative is 
outlined for key leaders and Stakeholders before the project is formally initiated. 
Long-term project success requires a common understanding of the change, 
combined with the ability to confront challenges during the course of a project. 
The  OCM  practitioner  assists  in  developing  the  common  understanding  by 
helping define the change and communicate it to key leaders and Stakeholders. 
Constraint – (1) A limiting factor that afects the executing of a project, program, 
portfolio or process. (2) Restriction that afects the scope of the project, usually 
involving availability; assignment; or use of project cost, schedule, or resources. 
(3) Any factor that afects when or how an activity can be scheduled. (4) Any 
factor  that  limits  the  project  team’s  options  and  can  lead  to  pressure  and 
resulting frustrations among team members. [Source: PMI.] 
Current State – Also known as “as-is.” Current state is a model of the current 
structure  and  may  include  such  elements  as  processes,  data,  applications, 
technology, etc. The current state is ofen used as a baseline for measuring the 
success of future changes or improvements. 
Employee Readiness – The level of willingness and preparation of employees 
to adopt changes or undertake an efort. 
Engagement – Active, open, dialog between a project team and Stakeholders 
involving communication of plans and status and elicitation of feedback.

Organizational Change Management Framework 
Environmental  Readiness  Assessment  –  The  Environmental  Readiness 
Assessment evaluates the level of willingness and preparation of an organization 
to adopt changes or undertake an efort, based on an analysis of environmental 
factors. 
Executing Process Phase – The Executing Process Phase, the OCM practitioner 
executes  the  activities  and  tasks  identified  in  the  previous  process  phases. 
The  OCM  practitioner  utilizes  strategic  thinking,  efective  communication, 
people  skills,  and  integration  skills  to  enroll  leadership  support,  engage 
Stakeholders, perform training and workforce transition activities, and continue 
communication and feedback activities regarding the initiative. 
Feedback Channels or Mechanisms – Feedback channels/mechanism are diferent  
ways  of  collecting  information,  feedback,  and  questions  from  Stakeholders.  A  
variety of feedback channels/mechanisms should be utilized in order to increase  
the flow of information, and thus, garner increased change support. 
Functional  Requirements  –  Characteristics  of  the  deliverable,  described  in 
ordinary, non-technical language that is understandable to the customer. 
Future State – Also known as “to-be.” A model of the future structure (such as 
process, data, applications, technology). 
Initiating Process Phase – In the Initiating Process Phase, the creation of a 
solid  change  foundation  reduces  project  risk  and  increases  the  likelihood  of 
overall success. The OCM Practitioner determines OCM priorities and potential 
issues based on the project’s nature, size, scope, and complexities. In addition, 
the OCM Practitioner continues to communicate key messages in order to keep 
Stakeholders informed, mitigate risks, and gather feedback. 
Inputs – Information and/or documents that feed into a process. Inputs may 
include outputs from other Frameworks, such as the CA-BPR and the CA-PMF, 
other process phases, or other knowledge areas. 
Knowledge Area  –  Organized  groupings  of  related  OCM  activities  that  share 
a  common  objective  and  purpose.  Activities  from  multiple  knowledge  areas 
occur within a single process phase. OCM’s six knowledge areas include OCM 
Lifecycle Management, Communication, Leadership Support, Team Dynamics, 
Stakeholder Enrollment, and Training. 
Knowledge Transfer – Flow of knowledge, skills, information, and competencies 
from  one  person  to  another.  Can  happen  through  any  number  of  methods, 
including  coaching,  mentoring,  training  courses  and  on-the-job  experience. 
Knowledge Transfer is very important in many cases, including at the end of a 
project when a contractor or development staf hand of a new system to state 
employees who will operate and maintain the system on a day-to-day basis.

Organizational Change Management Framework 
Leadership Engagement – Leadership engagement is the process of engaging 
leaders in a change initiative. To achieve full enrollment, leaders must move 
through the process of understanding, accepting, and embracing the change. 
Leadership  Readiness  –  Leadership  readiness  refers  to  a  leader’s  level  of 
engagement  in  the  change  initiative.  Leaders  with  a  high  level  of  leadership 
readiness  embrace  the  initiative  and  are  prepared  to  move  forward  with  all 
phases  of  the  project.  Leaders  with  a  low  level  of  leadership  readiness  may 
experience resistance and lack support for the change. 
Leadership Support Knowledge Area – One of the CA-OCM’s six knowledge areas,  
Leadership Support increases leadership involvement in and support for change  
initiatives. Leadership Support should be visible to employees since leaders are  
linked to the culture of the organization. Understanding leadership is imperative  
to understanding the organization’s culture and providing a lever for changing  
the culture. Leaders shape and create the organization’s attitude toward change  
and then reinforce it through their behavior and style. Employees look to their  
organization’s leaders at all levels to accept and engage in the change efort. In  
terms  of  organizational  change,  providing  leadership  with  information  about  
their organization’s culture and attitude toward change is a useful way for them  
to begin to be aware of their impact on the organization and the change efort. 
Lessons  Learned  –  The  knowledge  gained  during  a  project,  showing  how 
project  events  were  addressed  or  should  be  addressed  in  the  future  for  the 
purpose of improving future performance. Documented experiences that can 
be used to improve the future management of projects. [Source: PMI and APM.] 
Milestone  –  (1)  Used  to  measure  the  progress  of  a  project  and  signifies 
completion or start of a major deliverable or other significant metric such as 
cost incurred, hours used, payment made, and so on. (2) Identifiable point in a 
project or set of activities that represents a reporting requirement or completion 
of a large or important set of activities. 
Mitigation  –  (1)  Carefully  organized  steps  taken  to  reduce  or  eliminate  the 
probability of a risk occurring or the impact of a risk on a project. (2) Actions 
taken  to  eliminate  or  reduce  risk  by  reducing  the  probability  and  or  impact  
of occurrence. 
Mitigation Strategy – Carefully organized steps taken to reduce or eliminate 
the probability of a risk occurring or the impact of a risk on a project. 
Non-functional  Requirements  –  Non-functional  requirements  define  the 
operation  of  a  system.  They  may  include  quality  attributes,  design  and 
implementation constraints, and external interfaces that the system must have.

OCM  Lifecycle  Management  Knowledge  Area  –  One  of  the  CA-OCM’s  six 
knowledge areas, OCM Lifecycle Management plans, defines, and manages the 
activities  necessary  to  transition  the  organization  and  its  people  to  a  future 
state. The activities in this knowledge area govern the performance of all other 
knowledge  area  activities  and  guide  management  activities  that  are  specific 
to OCM. OCM Lifecycle Management provides the tools necessary for the OCM 
Practitioner to manage the OCM efort throughout the project, as well as identify 
areas that can be customized within the OCM efort. 
Organizational  Change  Management  (OCM)  –  A  structured  approach  to 
shifing or transitioning an organization from the current state to a desired future 
state. OCM is the application of a set of tools, processes, skills, and principles 
for managing the people side of change to achieve the desired organizational 
change. It is a process aimed at empowering employees to accept and embrace 
changes  in  their  business  environment.  OCM  is  frequently  required  during  a 
project  and/or  upon  implementation  of  the  project’s  product  or  other  end 
result. 
Output – The tangible or intangible product typically delivered by a project. 
[Source: APM.] 
Planning  Process  Phase  –  The  Planning  Process  Phase  addresses  the 
organization, preparation, definition, and refinement of how the project and 
related  OCM  eforts  will  be  executed  and  monitored.  The  Planning  Process 
Phase helps guide successful completion of essential OCM planning activities. 
The OCM Practitioner will define and refine the OCM and training objectives. 
They  will  develop  knowledge  area  strategies,  plans,  activities,  and  tasks  to 
attain those objectives, and establish methods for measuring their efectiveness 
for maximum success. 
Preferred Senders – In communication, the message disseminators that are 
most suitable to communicate certain messages. Preferred senders vary due to 
audience groups, message content, timing, and delivery channel. 
Process  Phase  –  A  collection  of  logically  related  project  activities  that 
culminates  in  the  completion  of  one  or  more  deliverables.  (The  California 
Project Management Framework (CA-PMF) describes each of the five process 
phases: Concept, Initiating, Planning, Executing, and Closing.) [Source: PMI.]

Project Approval Lifecycle (PAL) – California has adopted the PAL to improve  
the quality, value and likelihood of success for technology projects undertaken by  
the State of California. The PAL is intended to ensure projects are undertaken with  
clear business objectives, accurate costs and realistic schedules. The PAL includes  
various stages separated by gates that are specifically tailored for IT projects. 
•  PAL Stage 1 – Business Analysis: Provides a basis for project management, 
program  management,  executive  management,  and  state-level  control 
agencies to understand and agree on business problems or opportunities, 
and the objectives to address them. 
•  PAL Stage 2 – Alternatives Analysis: Provides a basis for how the proposal’s 
business objectives will be achieved, the evaluation of multiple alternative 
solutions, determines which alternative will yield the highest probability of 
meeting the business objectives, and to develop an acquisition strategy/ 
plan for procuring services. 
•  PAL Stage 3 – Solution Development: Provides confirmation of the solution 
requirements needed to achieve the business objectives and development 
of the Request for Proposal (RFP) for the acquisition of services if needed. 
•  PAL Stage 4 – Project Readiness Approval: A Solution Project Readiness and  
Approval Analysis that solicits bids from vendors as to how they propose to  
meet  the  business  requirements  of  the  chosen  alternative  approach,  and  
where the final form of the project is approved to go forward. 
Project Management Lifecycle (PMLC) – A series of process phases to provide 
better  management  and  control  over  a  project.  During  each  phase  process, 
activities and tools are used to fulfill project goals or objectives. The PMLC is 
designed to accommodate projects that vary in size and complexity. 
Project Management Plan (PMP) – The document that describes how executing,  
monitoring, and controlling of the project will be conducted. [Source: PMI.] 
Project Vision  –  A  statement  that  captures  the  long-term  picture  of  what  the  
organization or project wants to become. A vision statement typically strives to be  
inspirational, memorable, and reflect the desires of those with vested interests. 
Requirement – A requirement is defined as “a condition or capability that must 
be met or possessed by a system or system component to satisfy a contract, 
standard, specification, or other formally imposed documents” (IEEE 610-12- 
1990 [R2002]). Therefore, requirements identify, in objective terms, the criteria 
used  to  measure  project  success.  Requirements  should  be  captured  and 
approved as early as possible in the project.

Organizational Change Management Framework 
Resistance to Change – Resistance to change refers to an individual’s natural 
inclination  to  resist  changes  of  any  kind.  Resistance  is  ofen  unique  to  each
individual. Resistance may vary in timing and the way it manifests itself. However, 
resistance to change is normal, and it should be expected and planned for. 
Risk – An uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative 
efect on one or more project objectives. 
Risk Tolerance – The criteria against which Stakeholders evaluate a risk. Diferent 
risk tolerances may be defined for each risk, risk category, or combination of 
risks. Exceeding a risk threshold is a condition that triggers some action. 
Root-Cause Analysis – Root-cause analysis is a process of identifying underlying 
causes of a problem through the use of specific analytical methods. Example 
methods  include,  5-Whys  Analysis,  Barrier  Analysis,  Change  Analysis,  Casual 
Factor  Tree  Analysis,  Failure  Mode  and  Efects  Analysis,  Fish-Bone  Diagram, 
Pareto Analysis, and Fault Tree Analysis. 
Scope  –  The  totality  of  the  outputs,  outcomes,  and  benefits  and  the  work
required to produce them. [Source: APM.] 
System  Development  Lifecycle  (SDLC)  –  This  is  a  model  used  in  project 
management that describes the stages (or phases) involved in an information 
system  development.  The  purpose  is  to  meet  user  requirements  in  support 
of business strategic goals and objectives. Also see SDLC Phase descriptions. 
[Source: PMI.] 
Stakeholder Enrollment Knowledge Area – One of the CA-OCM’s six knowledge 
areas, Stakeholder Enrollment engages Stakeholders in a change initiative and 
identifies and addresses employees’ resistance to change. Stakeholders include 
persons or groups who are directly or indirectly afected by a project, as well as 
those who may have the ability to influence its outcome. 
Stakeholder  enrollment  is  the  act  of  methodically  introducing  a  change  to 
Stakeholders and obtaining their engagement and buy in. Stakeholders form 
the  foundation  of  a  change,  and  their  enrollment  drives  change  progress. 
Ofentimes, Stakeholders provide a mirror into the attitude and culture of an 
organization.  Enrollment  activities  will  identify  Stakeholders  and  guide  the 
efort to involve them. 
Team Building – Team building addresses intra- and intergroup competition, 
and  rigidities  and  unresponsiveness  within  an  organization.  Team  members
are  encouraged  to  address  team  dynamics  problems  by  performing  self-
assessments, meeting regularly to discuss issues and celebrate successes, and 
holding each other accountable.

Team Dynamics Knowledge Area – One of the CA-OCM’s six knowledge areas, 
Team  Dynamics  creates  a  cohesive  project  team  and  maintains  efective 
team  dynamics.  The  project  team  needs  to  work  harmoniously  to  maximize 
productivity and minimize issues and risks related to challenging team dynamics. 
In addition, as proponents of the change within an organization, the project 
team  should  be  sensitive  to  the  organization  and  team  culture.  The  overall 
project team may consist of individuals representing diferent organizations, 
such as state and contractor employees, as well as diferent disciplines, such as 
project management, OCM, BPR, and technical professionals. 
Training Knowledge Area – One of the CA-OCM’s six knowledge areas, Training 
provides end users with thoughtful, applicable training in preparation for their 
transition  into  the  future  state.  A  thoughtful  training  approach  will  prepare 
end users for their new roles by equipping them with the knowledge and skills 
necessary to succeed. Training is a key component to project implementations 
and should be tailored specifically to the needs of the organization and end 
users.  Training  can  be  customized  in  content,  delivery  channel,  and  timing, 
among other factors.
