When scrolling to the bottom of the page, affix-Plugin sets the class "affix-
bottom" and sets inline styles like "position: relative; top: XYZpx;". The
Problem is, that the inline "position: relative" aren't removed after
scrolling up again. It would be better, to set "position: relative" via the
class "affix-bottom" (which works correct) and not via javascript. That would
solve the problem.
BTW: I use Mac OS 10.9.3, Chrome 35.0.1916.114
