**Title: Black Hat US-19: Exploring the New World - Remote Exploitation of SQLite and Curl**

Over the past few years, our team has developed and applied several innovative approaches to identify multiple critical vulnerabilities in SQLite and Curl, two of the most widely used foundational software libraries. These sets of vulnerabilities, which we have named "Magellan" and "Dias," respectively, have a broad impact on a wide range of devices and software.

We successfully exploited these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to some of the most popular Internet of Things (IoT) devices, including Google Home with Chrome, one of the most widely used web servers (Apache+PHP), and one of the most commonly used developer tools (Git).

In this presentation, we will share our new methods for discovering vulnerabilities in SQLite and Curl through fuzzing and manual code auditing. Using these methods, we identified "Magellan," a set of three heap buffer overflow and heap data disclosure vulnerabilities in SQLite (CVE-2018-20346, CVE-2018-20505, CVE-2018-20506). We also discovered "Dias," a pair of remote memory leak and stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities in Curl (CVE-2018-16890 and CVE-2019-3822).

Given the widespread impact of these vulnerabilities, we issued a vulnerability alert to notify affected vendors and facilitate timely patches. In this talk, we will disclose the details of "Magellan" and "Dias" for the first time, highlighting some of our novel exploitation techniques.

The presentation will be structured as follows:
1. **Analysis of Magellan**: We will delve into how we used the Magellan vulnerabilities to achieve the first public remote exploit of Google Home.
2. **Exploitation of Dias**: We will discuss the methods we employed to leverage the Dias vulnerabilities to conduct remote attacks on Apache+PHP and Git.
3. **Summary and Recommendations**: We will conclude by summarizing our research findings and providing security development advice to developers of foundational software libraries.

This presentation aims to not only highlight the vulnerabilities but also to offer practical insights and recommendations to enhance the security of widely used software components.
