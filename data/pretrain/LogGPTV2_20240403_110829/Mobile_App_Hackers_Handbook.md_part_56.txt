### Device and Network Access
For users who have network access on a desktop or laptop but not on their mobile device, instructions for installing Store apps via sideloading are available at the Windows Phone site: [http://www.windowsphone.com/en-gb/how-to/wp8/apps/how-do-i-install-apps-from-an-sd-card](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-gb/how-to/wp8/apps/how-do-i-install-apps-from-an-sd-card).

In Windows Phone 8.1, you also have the option to install an app directly to an SD card, rather than just installing it from the SD card onto the device.

### Company App Sideloading/Distribution
For applications developed for internal use within organizations, a distribution method known as "Company app distribution" allows bypassing the Store and Microsoft certification processes. This method is available on Windows Phone 8 and 8.1.

#### Requirements:
- **Company Account Registration**: Register a company account on the Windows Phone Dev Center.
- **Enterprise Certificate Acquisition**: Acquire an enterprise certificate for signing your apps.
- **App Development and Signing**: Develop and sign your applications using the acquired enterprise certificate.
- **Company Hub Application**: Many companies develop a "Company Hub" application to act as a portal for downloading internal apps.

#### Employee Enrollment:
- Employees must enroll their phones for app distribution from their company.
- Once enrolled, they can install internal apps signed with the company’s enterprise certificate.

For detailed documentation, refer to Microsoft's official guide: [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/jj206943(v=vs.105).aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/jj206943(v=vs.105).aspx).

### Targeted Application Distribution
Targeted app distribution allows you to publish your application via the Dev Center while hiding it from view in the Windows Phone Store.

#### Process:
- **Vetting and Certification**: All targeted apps undergo the same vetting and certification process as regular Store apps.
- **Selective Access**: After Microsoft approves and certifies your app, you can provide a download link to selected users, such as members of a specific organization, club, or user group.
- **Visibility Control**: The app remains hidden in the Store but is downloadable by users with the provided link. The publisher can later unhide the app to make it visible to all Store users.

For more information, see Microsoft's official documentation on MSDN.

### Developer Sideloading
Developer sideloading is the most general and easily accessible method for installing apps without code signing. It is essential for developers to test their apps on real devices.

#### Steps:
1. **Developer Account Registration**: Register for a developer account.
2. **Device Registration**: Register your device to attain "developer unlock."
   - Use the Windows Phone Developer Registration application, which is part of the WP8 and WP8.1 SDKs.
   - Each developer account can unlock up to three devices.
   - One device can be unlocked with just a Live ID.

3. **Application Deployment**:
   - Deploy application packages using the Application Deployment tool, which is included in the Windows Phone SDKs.
   - Applications do not need to be signed, allowing developers to create and distribute unsigned apps to other developer-unlocked devices.

For detailed instructions, refer to the "Developer Unlocking Your Device" section.

### Building a Test Environment
A well-equipped test environment is crucial for penetration testing and exploratory activities on mobile platforms.

#### Tools and Knowledge:
- **Desktop vs. Mobile**: Standard desktop applications can be disassembled and analyzed using tools like IDA Pro, Windbg, OllyDbg, GDB, and Valgrind. However, modern mobile operating systems are more closed.
- **Mobile Penetration Testing**: Having more involved access to a device, such as bypassing security controls, is often necessary for thorough security assessments.
- **SDK Tools**: Essential tools include Visual Studio and the emulator, which are part of the Windows Phone SDKs.

### SDK Tools
SDK tools are core to development and security review activities on Windows Phone 8.x.

#### Obtaining the Development Tools:
- **Windows Phone 8.1 SDK**: Available for free and includes Visual Studio Express 2013, emulators, and other development tools.
- **Windows Phone 8 SDK**: Free bundle including Visual Studio Express 2012 for Windows Phone, SDK, emulators, and additional tools.

#### Installation:
- **Windows Phone 8.1 SDK**: Requires Windows 8.1 or later. Download from: [http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs#d-express-windows-8](http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs#d-express-windows-8).
- **Windows Phone 8 SDK**: Requires Windows 8 or later. Download from: [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=265772](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=265772).

### Visual Studio
Visual Studio is Microsoft’s integrated development environment (IDE) used for developing applications that use Microsoft technologies or run on Windows platforms.

#### Features:
- **Project Templates**: Various templates for creating new projects.
- **Code Review and Debugging**: Manually review source code, run projects on emulators and devices, and use debugging tools.
- **Testing and Development**: Create test cases, test harnesses, and develop security-related testing tools.

### Emulator
The Windows Phone emulators are invaluable tools included in the WP8 and 8.1 SDKs.

#### Usage:
- **Running Applications**: Build and launch applications from Visual Studio or deploy prebuilt XAP and APPX files using the Application Deployment tool.
- **Emulation Environment**: Provides a genuine Windows Phone instance running in a virtual machine, with the same sandbox and capabilities restrictions as a real device.

### Developer Unlocking Your Device
Developer unlocking enables you to sideload unsigned apps onto your device, which is crucial for security testing and experimentation.

#### Steps:
1. **Launch Developer Registration Tool**: Depending on the version of Windows Phone.
2. **Connect Device**: Ensure the device is connected, unlocked, and has the correct time and date.
3. **Register Device**: Click Register and log in with your Windows Live or Developer account.

### Capability Unlocking Your Device
To conduct thorough security reviews, you need certain capabilities that are not normally provided by the OS.

#### Methods:
- **Custom ROM/ROM Modification**
- **Exploiting Software Vulnerabilities**
- **Hardware Means (e.g., JTAG)**

#### Supported Devices:
- **Samsung Ativ GT-I8750**
- **Huawei Ascend W1**

For detailed instructions, refer to the specific sections for each device model and OS version.

### Preparing Samsung Ativ GT-I8750 and Huawei Ascend W1
We recommend using a device running Windows Phone 8.1 for testing, as more developers are targeting this version. Follow the instructions in the respective sections for interop unlock and filesystem access.

#### Samsung Ativ Full Capability Unlock and Filesystem Access on Windows Phone 8
If you are using a device running Windows Phone 8, follow these instructions to unlock all capabilities and gain full filesystem access. However, we recommend upgrading to Windows Phone 8.1 for better compatibility and features.
