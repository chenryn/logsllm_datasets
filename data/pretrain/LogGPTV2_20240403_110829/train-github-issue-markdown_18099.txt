#### Challenge Name
Build a Tribute Page
#### Issue Description
Please update this step in the instructions for setting up CodePen? Also in
the video.
Adding Bootstrap to CodePen now defaults to the alpha of V4 of Bootstrap, so
the Bootstrap V3 code that I learned on FCC (like my columns) wasn't working
originally. Maybe let others know and encourage them to add Bootstrap to
CodePen with this link?:
https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css Might
save them some time. Thank you!
