User: TAB completion works fine in iPython terminal, but not in Firefox browser. 
So far I had tried but failed,
1). run a command $ sudo easy_install readline, 
then the .egg file was wrote in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/readline-6.2.4.1-py2.7-linux-x86_64.egg,
but TAB completion still doesn't work in Jupyter Notebook.
2). also tried to find locate the ipython_notebook_config.py or  ipython_config.py, but failed.
I use Python 3.5 and iPython 4.0.0.  and both are installed in Ubuntu 15.10  /usr/share/anaconda3/bin/ipython.
Any help would be appreciated!
Assistant: The best fix I've found for this issue was to create a new Environment. If you are using Anaconda simply create a new environment to fix the issue. Sure you have to reinstall some libraries but its all worth it.
