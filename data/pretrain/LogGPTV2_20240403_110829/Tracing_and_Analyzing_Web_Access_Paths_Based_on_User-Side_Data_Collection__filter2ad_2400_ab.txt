### Tracing Methods and Analysis

#### 1. Tracing within the Current Tab
If a suitable record is not found within the current tab, the global tracing method is employed to identify the previous access record from the user's entire past access history. Our scheme primarily analyzes a single user’s access records in one browser tab, which makes the analysis more efficient compared to methods that do not minimize the scope of the analysis.

#### 2. Detailed Tracing Methods
The four tracing methods are elaborated below:

- **Reload Tracing**: A "reload" transition type indicates that the page is reloaded. This includes:
  - The reload button/menu on the browser was pressed/selected.
  - The same URL as the previous access was entered in the address bar.
  - The session was reconstructed by selecting one of the recently closed tabs in the browser’s history menu.
  - A browser set to continue where its user left off on startup was started.
  - In all these cases, the tab URL remains the same.

- **In-tab Tracing**: Analyzes the access records within the current tab using referer and mainframe information.

- **Source-tab Tracing**: Identifies the latest past main frame access on the source tab.

- **Global Tracing**: Uses referer, origin, and mainframe information to trace access records across all tabs and sessions.

### Identifying Access Path Entry Points

The processes described in Section 3.1 are iterated until they identify the first access of the hazardous path, i.e., the entry point. An access that does not follow links and is discontinuous from the previous access is considered an entry point. The following types of accesses are considered as entry points:

- **Bookmark Access**: A user jumps to the desired page by selecting a bookmark entry on the browser. This is determined when the transition type is "auto_bookmark."

- **Session Reconstruction**: Sessions can be reconstructed by selecting one of the recently closed tabs in the browser’s history menu. This is determined if the transition type is "reload" and no access was found on the same tab for more than a predefined amount of time.

- **Web Search**: A user finds various pages of interest by submitting a new search query on general web search engines. This is determined if the URL is one of the top pages of major search engines or if the transition type is "form_submit" and the URL is a search result page of major search engines.

- **Omnibar Access**: The omnibar on the Chrome browser combines an address bar with the Google search box. Users can use the omnibar to initiate a web search or access their browsing history. The transition type "generated" identifies access based on the selection of choices provided by the omnibar.

- **Address Typing**: Users often enter a new URL to initiate another browsing activity. If the domain of the page differs from the previous page, it is considered an entry point.

- **Start Page Access**: When the Chrome browser starts, the page specified by the program argument or set as the default opens. If the transition type is "start_page," we consider that the browser was launched and the page was specified in the program argument or set as the default page.

### Case Studies

We extract hazardous paths by applying the techniques described in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. Two cases are described to demonstrate their effectiveness:

- **Table 1**: Shows an entire hazardous path that reaches a URL labeled "SOCIAL_ENGINEERING" by GSB. The in-tab and global tracing methods identified the access path, leading to the initial access via a bookmark at 16:13:54.

- **Table 2**: Shows an entire hazardous path that reaches a URL labeled "MALWARE" by GSB. The in-tab and source-tab tracing methods identified the access path, leading to the initial access via a bookmark at 15:26:57.

### Unveiling User Behavior

Web access data collected at the user side reveals user IDs and browser tab IDs, enabling us to efficiently reconstruct access paths. It also provides data such as transition type, which helps in identifying access path entry points. In this section, we analyze the data to unveil user behavior, answering the following questions:

- What are the initial accesses of hazardous paths?
- What is the risk level of bookmarked URLs?
- How long does it take for users to reach malicious URLs?
- How many active browser tabs do users open when accessing malicious URLs?

### Path Entry Point Analysis

Recent browsers have measures to reduce accidental access to malicious URLs from ISPs' portal sites or major search engines. However, users still reach malicious URLs through web browsing. Table 3 shows the breakdown of the types of initial accesses on hazardous paths over 12 months. "Bookmark access" was the most frequent entry point, followed by "web search" and "session reconstruction."

### Bookmarked URL Analysis

Table 4 shows the domains of bookmarked URLs that most frequently reach malicious URLs. The list includes pornography sites, illegal book/manga sharing sites, and file-sharing sites, but also legitimate search engines like google.com and yahoo.co.jp.
