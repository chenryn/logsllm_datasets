I installed the `python-mode` plugin for Vim on my Mac OSX system and decided to try out one of the Python motion commands. When I pressed `[C`, which I believed would take me to the next class, the screen changed to display only the class names in gray highlighting. I've reviewed the `python-mode` documentation, but I couldn't find any information about this behavior or how to revert it.

I thought that quitting and reloading the file might resolve the issue, but when I reopened the file, it still showed only the class names, highlighted in gray, along with the line numbers. How can I exit this "mode" or state?

**Assistant:**

It sounds like you have inadvertently enabled code folding, a feature that collapses sections of your code (in this case, classes) to show only the headings. To disable this behavior, you can add the following line to your `~/.vimrc` file:

```vim
let g:pymode_folding = 0
```

Alternatively, if you prefer to keep folding enabled, you can use the space bar to toggle the visibility of the folded sections. You can also set `foldclose=all` in your `~/.vimrc` to automatically fold sections when you leave them:

```vim
set foldclose=all
```

To exit the current folded state without changing your configuration, you can use the following command in normal mode:

- Press `za` to toggle the current fold.
- Press `zR` to open all folds.
- Press `zM` to close all folds.

This should help you return to the full view of your code.
