User: I installed python-mode for vim on my Mac OSX system. I decided to try one of the python motion commands. I hit [C which I thought would go to the next class. But the screen also switched, to show ONLY class names in gray highlighting. I've searched the python-mode documentation, and I can't see anything about this happening, and therefore no way to undo it.
Well, I thought, I will just quit and reload, and everything will be fine. But no! When I come back in to the file, it opens as I left it, with just the class names showing, highlighted in gray, and indications of line numbers.
How do I get out of this "mode" or whatever I am stuck in?
Assistant: If you are not happy with folding, you might like to disable python-mode folding by keeping let g:pymode_folding = 0 in ~/.vimrc.
What I usually do is enable folding and use space bar to open it. I also set set foldclose=all to automatically fold unfolded fold
