4.2 Open Service Relationships
Servicenetworksrelyonafundamentalelementwhichconnectsservicesystems:
relationships.TheOpenSemanticServiceRelationship(OSSR)model[4]isused
to capture the dependencies that exist between aggregated SaaS and atomic
SaaS applications (i.e. services which do not depend on other services). The
model considers that service systems are represented with existing description
languages, such as Linked USDL, and derives a rich, multi-level relationship
model. Service relationships are very different from the temporal and control-
flow relations found in business process models. They relate service systems
accounting for various perspectives such as roles, associations, dependencies,
and comparisons.

4.3 Service Network Construction
AnOSSNnetworkismodelledasatime-varyinghypergraphSN,suchasSN(t)=
{S(t),C(t),R(t)}, where S(t) is the set of services provided and C(t) is the set
of service consumers, with both being modeled with USDL. R(t) is the set of
relationships modeled with OSSR connecting consumers and services provided.
Forexample,binaryrelationshipscanbedepictedasedgesinadirectedgraph
(see section 5). Time is represented by the parameter t, whose granularity is set
to appropriately model the market (e.g., days). Consumers alter the topologyof
a service network by diffusion when they adopt or abandon a service by adding
or deleting an OSSR relationship to it.
To construct a service network SN, USDL and OSSR models are remotely
accessed and retrieved (an overview description of the infrastructure to access
and retrieve USDL and OSSR instances is described in [7]). OSSR models are
mapped to relationship R(t).
5 Service Network Analysis
AwidespectrumoftechniquesandalgorithmscanbedevelopedtostudyOSSNs.
For example, reasoning techniques can be developed to explore the notion of re-
lationships as bonds. By discovering strong cliques, we can hypothesize that
the stronger the relationships, the stronger the unification and the greater the
commonality of fates. As a result, it would be possible to infer that a tightly
coupled service network will sink or swim together. Other fundamental algo-
rithms which are valuable to implement come from the field of network science.
For example, algorithms to detect if an OSSN is a scale-free networks [15]. This
property strongly correlates with the robustness of a network to failures. This
can prove to be important in financial markets. As another example, the pref-
erential attachment [22] can be explored to forecast the structural evolution of
service networks.

service network.
5.1 OSSN Optimization
SN = (N,E,l ,l ), is a node and edge labeled directed graph (initially we are
n e
modeling acyclic graphs) where
N = S ∪ C
E = S × S ∪ S × C
l : N → Description
n
l : E → Color
e
The nodes N are either services S or consumers C.
The consumer nodes are sinks (no outgoing edges).
Certain services are atomic (i.e., not formed as compositions of simpler ser-
vices).
In our initial modeling we consider them to be sources (i.e., no incoming
edges).
There will be edges from services to other services as well as consumers.
To support constructing optimal constructions of OSSNs at particular time
points, we model a service network as follows: SN =(N,E,l ,l ) is a node and
n e
edge labeled directed graph (initially we are modeling acyclic graphs) where
N = S ∪ C
E = S × S ∪ S × C
l : N → Description

ThenodesN areeitherservicesS orconsumersC.Theconsumernodesaresinks
(nooutgoingedges).Certainservicesareatomic(i.e.,notformedascompositions
of simpler services). In our initial modeling we consider them to be sources (i.e.,
no incoming edges). There will be edges from services to other services as well
as consumers.
The node labels indicate the semantics of services or the demands of cus-
tomers. The edge labels are abstract representations of type. A service, in gen-
eral, takes one or more input types (colors) and produces one or more output
types (colors). Initially, type matching is simple, but we plan to generalize it
to model subsumption hierarchies. The color of an edge will be set to the most
general of the two matching colors (i.e. the more general type). If there is no
match, there will be no edge. Below, an algorithm will be outlined for maximal
service network construction. This network will then be trimmed with its flow
quantified by using mathematical optimization techniques.
The optimal construction of a service network is divided into two phases:
maximal color-compliant service network construction and cost minimization.
The algorithm for phase I builds a service network from three sets of nodes,
atomic services (sources), composite services (intermediate nodes), and con-
sumers (sinks). Starting with the sources, all intermediate and consumer nodes
are connected by edges that are color compliant, e.g., if an intermediate node
needsablueinputandgreeninputandthereexistsourcesproducing/outputting
thesecolors,thenthisintermediatenodeisaddedtothegraph.Thisprocesscon-
tinues through k stages, a parameter indicating the maximum number of stages
(i.e., distance from source to sink) desired.
Once the graph has been created, it can be reduced to an optimal form
usingLinearProgramming.Suchproblemsrequireanobjectivefunctioninterms
of decision variables, and constraints on the values of those decision variables.
Our objective function is the cost of the network, and our decision variables
representtheflowofmaterialthroughthenetworkandtheamountofproduction
atintermediatenodes.Flowisdeterminedbytheedgesandintermediatenodes,
so each of these will have a decision variable. The flow is constrained by the
supply, production, or demand capacity of the nodes in the network, and by
the required number of inputs for each non-source node. Once the constraints
are gathered, a Linear Programming algorithm such as the Simplex algorithm,
can be used to find the optimal values for the decision variables. These values
determine the optimal amount of flow through the network and the value of the
objective function estimates the minimum cost.
5.2 Evolutionary Analysis of OSSN
In our second example, let us assume that each service system contains a value
propositioncommunicatedtocustomers(i.e,theattractivenesselementsorpref-
erential attachment). Service value is judged from the perspective of consumers
as they compare services among the alternatives. For simplicity reasons, we as-
sume that the value proposition is similar for all service systems and it is the
price of the services calculated from a usdl-price:PricePlan15. This concept
if part of the Linked USDL family.
Sinceourobjectiveistoforecasttheevolutionofaservicenetworkovertime,
we use the following function to calculate the Market Share of each service pro-
vided MS(s )=degree(s )/m; where degree(s ) is the number of relationships
i i i
established by service s with service consumers and m is the total number of
i
relationshipsestablishedbetweenprovidersandconsumers.Overtime,customers
change preferences by changing from one service system to another service sys-
tem provider.

Fig.3. Service market share evolution overtime [6]
Let us assume that the (re)constructed SN topology shows that overtime
the market share is the one represented in Fig. 3 at t = 3. One question to be
answered is: ”what will happen to the market in the future if the conditions are
not changed?” (i.e. the value propositions of s remain the same and m ≯ c ).

According to Bass model [2], the leading service system will reach a fixedpoint
market share according to the following formula (a and b are constants):
1−e−bt
MS(s ,t)= ;0≤t≤9 (1)
i 1+ae−bt
15 For simplicity reasons, we consider that each service has only one pricing plan.

acceleratesbecauseoftheincreasingreturnseffectofpreferentialattachment.In
this case, all but one service provided leaves the market, leaving one monopoly
competitor. The SNA field can, therefore, develop mathematical models which
can help to forecast the evolution of service network overtime.
5.3 Cooperative Analysis of OSSN
In our third example, we explored the suitability of OSSNs to model system
dynamics. Instead of looking at causes and their effects in isolation, we analyze
service networks as systems made up of interacting parts. Once an OSSN is
created from distributed service models, cause-effect or network effect diagrams
can be derived for the network. For example, Fig. 4 shows service systems S ,
i
S , S , and directed edges illustrating internal and external relationships.

Causal relationships connect Key Performance Indicators (KPI) from dif-
ferent services’ and within services. The pattern represented by this OSSN is
commonly known as the ’Tragedy of the Commons’ archetype. It hypothesizes
that if the two services S and S overuse the common/shared service S , it will
i j k
become overloaded or depleted and all the providers will experience diminishing
benefits. Service S and S provide services to costumers. To increase net gains,
i j
both providers increase the availability of service instances. As the number of
instances increases, the margin decreases and there is the need to increase even
more the number of instances available. As the number of instances increases,
the stress on the availability of service S is so strong that the service collapses
