# Problem statement
When extending your desktop to multiple monitors, Windows 10 allows you to
position and align the monitors, but on a pixel by pixel alignment. When using
multiple monitors of different sizes and resolutions, it is difficult to drag
your mouse from one monitor to the next when the sizes are different. Where
the monitors don't align, your mouse cursor hits an invisible wall. Your eyes
go to the next monitor looking for the cursor, but it's trapped on the
previous monitor, right on the edge where your eyes don't see it. To find your
mouse, your frantically wiggle your mouse around to find it, eventually
dislodging it from the invisible wall, but sometimes sending it to a screen
you don't expect.
# Proposed feature
Always let the mouse go from one screen to the next. Never hit an invisible
wall between screens.
# Technical suggestions
You could either align the edges by percentage or specify an action when the
"invisible wall" is hit.  
Option A - If the mouse leaves monitor 1 at 5% of the total height, have it
enter the adjacent monitor 2 at the same 5% height.  
Option B - If the mouse leaves monitor 1 at 5% of the total height, and this
does not align with Monitor 2, provide a rule for how this is handled. This
could be things like "always at the top," "middle of monitor," or "bottom of
monitor."  
Option C - If you want to prove your coding skills and make a real power toy,
let every edge of a monitor be assignable to connect to any other screen or
screens. Sometimes the second monitor is both up and to the right. Some people
expect to use the right edge while other use the top edge. Let us assign both
edges to the second monitor. Or even better yet, let us position and size it
however we like, such as the top right edge and the right edge. Use the
percentage method to make it happen.
