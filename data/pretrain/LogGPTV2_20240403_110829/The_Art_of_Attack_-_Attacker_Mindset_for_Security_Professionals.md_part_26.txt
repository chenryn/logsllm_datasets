is not an option, you might try circumventing the target altogether
by applying AMs to neutralize technological defenses.
Although it is a hard argument to make that all people suffer
from optimism bias, it’s safe to say that many do and on many dif-
fering fronts. As an attacker, your best bet is to use optimism bias
for yourself and against the target. Ironically, you must believe that
228 TOOLS AND ANATOMY
your target suffers from this psychological phenomenon and act
accordingly; adopt a well-r ounded, comprehensive pretext and treat
most people as if they are not expecting to be approached, influ-
enced, and circumvented by you.
Confirmation Bias and Motivated Reasoning
Confirmation bias is the predisposition of searching for, interpret-
ing, favoring, and recalling information in a way that confirms or
strengthens your prior personal beliefs or assumptions. In other
words, confirmation bias is why people see what they want to see.
Here’s an example: You search online to back up what you think
is true, like “Area 51 Aliens,” and take into consideration the press
release in which the US Army Air Forces (USAAF) announced
they’d recovered a “flying disc” from a ranch near Roswell, but you
ignore the one after, in which USAAF stated it was actually weather
balloon debris.
Some believe Area 51 is researching and experimenting on
aliens and their spacecraft. Others theorize that the moon landing
was staged at Area 51. If you search, you will find. Confirmation
bias keeps you steady as you wade the murky waters of informa-
tion— it keeps you looking and agreeing only with information that
reinforces what you already know.
Another example of the confirmation bias is someone who forms
an initial impression of a person and then interprets everything that
this person does in a way that confirms this initial impression—f or
the good and the bad. Consider the debate over gun control. Let’s
say Alice is in support of gun control. She seeks out news stories
and opinion pieces that reaffirm her beliefs. When shootings occur,
she looks at the facts of the situation in a way that supports her
existing beliefs.
Bob, on the other hand, is as against gun control as any one per-
son could be. He too seeks out news sources that fit his viewpoint.
When shootings occur, he looks at the facts of the situation in a way
that supports his existing beliefs.
Psychology in Attacks 229
These two people have polar opposite positions on the same
subject. Even if they read the same story, their bias will likely shape
the way they perceive the details, further confirming their beliefs.
Now imagine they meet for the first time and in a place where
gun control was the main issue— each of them passionately advo-
cating on behalf of their own side of the debate. They share a tense
and dramatic conversation and part ways. But, oh dear, something
else happens. . .they meet again the next day as they are walking
into work. Bob just started working where Alice does and, worse
still, she’s going to be his buddy for the next few days to get him
settled in.
Most likely, they can, at least ostensibly, put their differences
aside to talk about the protocols that need to be followed. Alice will
be able to show Bob how to get to the cafeteria and how to clock in,
but there’s a slim chance of her trusting Bob, wanting to be friends
with him and wanting to know more about any of Bob’s other
beliefs. The same is true for Bob when considering Alice. They are
each operating on the belief that they are opposed on one major
front and will start looking for other facts to build their cases against
each other. When Bob sees Alice drive out of the parking garage in a
Prius and Alice looks over to see Bob’s pickup truck, they will each
build more beliefs about the other.
Confirmation bias can trick the mind into only looking for spe-
cific patterns based on a person’s previous experience and under-
standing, instead of considering each event as isolated. The use of
this cognitive shortcut is easily fathomable: evaluating evidence
requires a great deal of mental energy, so our brains select to take
shortcuts. This saves us all time and prevents us from feeling over-
whelmed with the constant bombardment of new information we
surround ourselves with every day.
Biases are, after all, a wonderful vulnerability to tap into. You
can most easily put this bias to good if you are fully dedicated to your
character and have assumed the role before you’ve even walked in
the door. This is because as you approach a person, they look for
information that supports, rather than rejects, their preconceptions,
230 TOOLS AND ANATOMY
typically by interpreting evidence to confirm existing beliefs while
discarding or discounting any incompatible data. If you are about
to enter an art gallery as a very wealthy person looking to buy a
piece of art, with some hidden objective (hopefully set by the cli-
ent), then you cannot simply assume this role as you talk with the
target inside. You would have to be in character upon arrival on the
street. Personally, I would arrive in a car, with a driver, I would be
dressed the part of my wealthy character, and I would be fully in the
role before I even stepped out onto the pavement. In taking pretex-
ting this seriously, you help the confirmation bias in your target and
over the whole environment bloom, which is only to your benefit.
With motivated reasoning, the tendency is to assign weight to
information that permits us to come to the conclusion we want
to reach. Accepting information that confirms our beliefs is far eas-
ier and less energetically consuming than reassessing and relearn-
ing. Contradicting information causes us to withdraw cognitively.
Although confirmation bias is an inherent tendency to observe
information that matches our established beliefs and ignore infor-
mation that doesn’t, motivated reasoning is our tendency to readily
accept new information that agrees with our worldview and criti-
cally analyze that which doesn’t. Using both against a target and
environment effectively is a very powerful force.
Using the two in tandem against a target is easier than it first
seems. Confirmation bias occurs from the direct influence of desire
on beliefs. When people want to think a certain idea or concept is
true, they end up believing it to be true. Once someone has formed
a view, they embrace information that confirms that view while
ignoring, or rejecting, information that casts doubt on it. Confir-
mation bias suggests that most of us don’t perceive circumstances
objectively. This is why, when performing attacks in a team, you
must most often play to what is typical within society, not what is
politically correct. For instance, it’s more likely that an older man
with me is my boss than I am his. Neither AMs nor social engi-
neering cares about what is politically correct. Neither does confir-
mation bias. Using confirmation bias as attackers demands we use
whatever is typical for the environment.
Psychology in Attacks 231
Motivated reasoning is actually suffused with emotion. Not only
are motivated reasoning and confirmation bias often inseparable, but
the positive or negative feelings about people, things, and ideas arise
more rapidly than the target’s conscious thoughts—i n a matter of
milliseconds, in fact. Many people, and so many targets, want to push
threatening information away and reel in nonthreatening informa-
tion. In our modern society, people have instinctual reflexes, not only
to tangible threats, but to information, too. And although we are not
only driven by emotions and biases, reasoning often happens later.
So for the sake of not making the target “think” too much, it is often
necessary that I show up as the assistant or the employee and not the
boss if culturally and traditionally that’s more fitting.
Framing Effect
The framing effect is a cognitive bias that impacts our decision mak-
ing when something is said or presented in different ways. In other
words, we are influenced heavily by how something is presented.
There are many subtypes of this bias, but I will concentrate on posi-
tive and negative frames.
At first glance, the framing effect doesn’t seem much differ-
ent from the other biases presented throughout this book or even
throughout this chapter, but this bias is a little special. Whereas with
the last three biases I’ve covered I have painted an all- or- nothing
type of situation— stay in character or you will get yourself caught;
don’t do what is politically correct, do what is expected, or you will
get caught, and so on—t he framing effect teaches you presentation
because this cognitive bias occurs when the outcome between the
two options is the same. When the options are framed differently,
they result in us choosing the one that is favorably framed.
There are different kinds of framing, but I will concentrate on
positive and negative frames. We’ve all been subject to marketing
strategies such as ‘Don’t miss out’ or ‘Get it before it’s gone’. The
frame is simple—make people feel like they are losing out on some-
thing. People tend to fear losses more so than gains and take action
232 TOOLS AND ANATOMY
to avoid losses. Negative frames are effective in certain scenarios
too, because they can create urgency. For instance, telling the front-
line of a building that their “audit” will be delayed three months
and that “headquarters” won’t be too pleased if you are turned away
now might be enough to make them reconsider allowing you entry
then and there.
Our fear of loss is strong, but we tend to seek out positivity. Posi-
tive frames often work better in convincing people. For example,
“I can be done and in and out of your hair in 30 minutes if I get going
now. You won’t see an auditor again until next year.” This also brings
into play the use of an artificial time constraint, which also results
in the illusion of a positive frame. An artificial time constraint is
manufactured restriction on time—using made-u p time constraints
can result in the neutralization of discomfort for the other party.
In an everyday example, how many times have you been sat next
to someone on an airplane, on public transport, or in a public place
and had them try to start a conversation with you? This can make
many of us feel uncomfortable and not because of the interaction
itself, but because we don’t know how long the intended conversa-
tion will last for. . . the whole flight? The entire length of the line at
the DMV? This is why artificial time constraints work so well with
positive framing—they create the illusion of a positive outcome in
a short amount of time.
However, the result is the same either way: the security guard
or receptionist can choose to let you in for 30 mins now so that they
don’t have to wait months for their next turn an at a safety audit,
which may have broader effects on the company (audits are often
mandatory), or you can have a teammate spoof a senior personnel’s
number and corner them into allowing you access. The results are
the same. The framing is different.
Looked at this way, even when you know you will get what you
want, you should frame it to the target to get them to feel one way or
another about it because getting people to feel a certain way about
something often allows them to react a certain way, which you can
often count on.
Psychology in Attacks 233
Framing, when used positively, is about covering your tracks
at a zero- distance range by giving the target the illusion of control:
you’re using a bias against them that results in them feeling good or
in charge. The other way to do this is to create a problem and then
offer a positive solution straight away, and it can be “personal” to
you rather than contingent upon the target environment: “This is
my first weekend with my kid in a month, and if I don’t get out of
here in 30 minutes I am going to be late and his mom/dad will make
a big deal of it. You can really help me out if I can just get this job
done.” This again gives someone a choice to make (and the illusion
of control over the situation), and if they lean in and help you out,
they also get to feel good about their choice.
As a note, I generally do not use negative framing, but I am not
in charge of every attacker looking to implement AMs by reading
this book, and they can be effective.
Thin- Slice Assessments
A successful attack depends on a target’s perception of the attack-
er’s personality, motivations, trustworthiness, and affect. Person-
perception research indicates that reliable and accurate assessments
of these traits can be made based on very brief observations, or
thin slices.
Thin slicing is a term that means making very quick inferences
about the state, characteristics, or details of an individual or a situ-
ation with nominal quantities of information. It is a type of social
cognition that proves beneficial in AMs and works both ways. You
can and should get comfortable performing thin- slice assessments
on your targets, and you should be aware they are doing something
of the same to you, whether it’s subconscious or not.
Thin slices of behavior is a term coined by researchers Nalini
Ambady and Robert Rosenthal (https://tspace.library.utoronto
.ca/handle/1807/33126). They discovered that very brief, dynamic
silent video clips, ranging from 2 to 10 seconds, provided sufficient
234 TOOLS AND ANATOMY
information for people with no special skills to evaluate a teacher’s
effectiveness, which was measured against the actual students’ final
course ratings of their teachers. Thin slices can be assessed from any
available means of communication, including the face, the body,
speech, the voice, or any combination of these. Notably, static photo-
graphs would not qualify as thin slices.
Thin- slice judgments have been shown to accurately predict the
effectiveness of doctors treating patients, the relationship status of
opposite- sex pairs interacting, judgments of rapport between two
persons, courtroom judges’ expectations as to a defendant’s guilt,
and even testosterone levels in males.
Malcolm Gladwell in Blink: The Power of Thinking Without
Thinking (Back Bay Books, 2007) shows art experts identifying a
piece of art as a forgery in the first few seconds of examination. Ten-
nis coaches have known whether the player will fault on a serve in
the half a second before it is even struck; a salesperson is able to read
someone’s emotions and future decisions on the basis of three sec-
onds of observation—t hese are examples of thin- slice assessments.
However, the thin- slice methodology is useful only if relevant and
valid information can be extracted from a person’s behavior in that
given moment. There are many factors that influence the accuracy
of thin- slice judgments, including culture and exposure, individual
differences in the ability to decode information accurately, differ-
ences in accuracy based on expertise, and the type of judgment
being made. This is where AMs comes in, and it works both ways.
As human beings, we are wonderful storytellers. We tell stories
about who we are, what we’re doing, and why we are doing it. To pass
someone else’s thin- slice assessment of us, we must be such good
storytellers that no one could possibly know we are deceiving them.
To do this, consider everything visual and auditory about yourself:
how you walk, your pace, your posture, your eye contact, your tone
of voice, your rate of speech, the words you use, and even your
blink rate. You have the upper hand—a s long as the target believes
your pretext, they are not judging your ability as an attacker; they
are judging you as who you have presented yourself as.
Psychology in Attacks 235
Looking at it the other way, you must be able to perform a thin-
slice assessment of your target. The more accurate your assessment,
the better your chances of success as an attacker. You may need to
alter your character’s persona once your assessment results are in.
You would when you wanted your target to stay or get to a more
relaxed state than your intended interaction would allow for. They
are judging and reacting to your behavioral stream, which is natu-
ral. You are using this against them and using your sampling of their
behavioral stream to carve the right outcome for your objective.
What is interesting, and not at all helpful when writing a section
of a book on it, is that there’s no real guidance on just how to per-
form a thin- slice assessment. We know that they are sampled from a
channel or a combination of channels of communication; we know
that people segment units of behavior and ascribe meaning to them,
even though life is more a continuous stream than isolated seg-
ments. People also tend to think that the more they know someone
and the more information they have, the more reliable their percep-
tion of them is— this is, paradoxically, why the first few moments
of interaction under your pretext are so critical. It sets the tone of
how the target envisions you as a whole person, not just the person
standing in front of them. Typically, we all aim to extend our first
impressions of someone and infer from there.
Something else to note is that research has found that people are
better at accurately judging targets from their own culture or similar
cultures to their own. Similarly, in- group benefits exist for tribes of
people, who show an advantage at accurately extrapolating details
about others based on thin slices of behavior. An example would be
a group of IT workers— they will likely tell if you are pretending to
be a sys admin based on a thin- slice assessment. Thin- slice judg-
ments can be affected by people’s expertise and competency, which
is important to note as an attacker if you need to impersonate some-
one to fit in at such a granular level.
The type of judgment being made matters, too, which is some-
what helpful to keep in mind (and to take the pressure off). Thin-
slice judgments are accurate only to the degree that applicable
236 TOOLS AND ANATOMY
variables are apparent to the assessor. In other words, it is possi-
ble to accurately assess how warm and likable a person appears to
be, because these characteristics can be swiftly revealed through
behavior. Other traits, depending on the situation you find a person
in, are shown over time, such as how persevering someone appears
to be. It’s harder in one, short interaction to see this in someone or
to have them see it in you. This is welcome news for us as attackers.
It means that in a short engagement, a solid pretext will afford us
enough cover to pass such assessments, with our own personality
and traits having little bearing on the outcome.
People tend to trust uniforms and overall appearance, even
though absolutely anyone can wear a uniform or dress as
