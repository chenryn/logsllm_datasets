  * VSCode Version: 1.2.0 stable
  * OS Version: Tried it on OS X 10.10.5 and Ubuntu 16.04
Steps to Reproduce:
  1. Open a file where breakpoints are supported
  2. Set a breakpoint at any line
  3. Right click the breakpoint and select "Edit Breakpoint"
  4. While the "Edit Breakpoint" dialog is open, move the line where the breakpoint is set
  5. Hit Enter to confirm the "Edit Breakpoint" dialog
  6. The breakpoint gets duplicated, but it should just move like it does if escape is pressed instead of Enter.
Note that this reproes without actually starting debugging.
