User: I'm currently using an application in python which works quite well but when I'm converting it with py2exe, the application seems to be suspended at the first "reactor.iterate"
Each time I press Ctrl+C to stop the application, the error is always the same and the application seems to be bloqued on a "reactor.iterate(4)"
This problem never occur with normal python interpreter.
Have you got an idea ?
Assistant: The typical use of the reactor is not to call reactor.iterate.  It's hard to say why exactly you're getting the behavior you are without seeing your program, but for a wild guess, I'd say switching to reactor.run might help.
