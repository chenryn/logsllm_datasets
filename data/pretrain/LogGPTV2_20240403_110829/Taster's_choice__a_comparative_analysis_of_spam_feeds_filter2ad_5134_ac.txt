| **Feed** | **DNS (%)** | **HTTP (%)** | **Tagged (%)** | **Alexa (%)** | **ODP (%)** |
|----------|-------------|--------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| Feed 1   | 55          | 72           | 85             | 83            | 5           |

| Feed 7   | 10          | 11           | <1             | 10            | 2           |
| Feed 8   | 12          | <1           | <1             | 12            | 10          |

**Note:** The first three columns (DNS, HTTP, and Tagged) are positive indicators—higher numbers indicate higher purity. The last two columns (Alexa and ODP) are negative indicators—higher numbers indicate lower purity.

### 4.1 Purity
The purity of a feed is a measure of the proportion of spam domains in the feed, as opposed to benign or non-existent domains. In other words, purity is the fraction of the feed that consists of true spam domains. True positives are spam domains correctly identified in the feed, while false positives are non-spam domains incorrectly included. Purity is analogous to precision in Information Retrieval or positive predictive value in Statistics.

The importance of purity varies depending on the application. For direct spam filtering, high purity is critical to avoid false positives. In contrast, for measurement studies where spam domains are further analyzed, low purity can increase the workload but generally has minimal impact on the final results after filtering.

#### 4.1.1 Non-existent Domains
The DNS column in Table 2 shows the proportion of domains in each feed that were registered based on several major TLDs (com, net, org, biz, us, aero, info). We checked the DNS zone files for these TLDs between April 2009 and March 2012, covering 63% to 100% of each feed. Blacklists, seeded honey accounts, and two of the three MX honeypot feeds had over 95% real domains. Human-identified spam and the hybrid feed had lower registration rates at 88% and 64%, respectively, which still pose little operational or experimental harm.

Two feeds, Bot and mx2, showed unusually low registration levels, primarily due to a period when the Rustock botnet generated random, unregistered domains. These domains are cheap to generate but costly to filter and analyze.

The HTTP column indicates the fraction of domains that responded with an HTTP 200 status code during the measurement period. Success rates ranged from 51% to 88% for most feeds, except for Bot and mx2, which had significantly lower rates.

#### 4.1.2 Known Spam
An HTTP response does not guarantee that a domain is spam. To identify true spam domains, we used the Web content tagging from the Click Trajectories project. These tags indicate domains associated with known online pharmacies, replica stores, or software stores. Such domains constituted 11–33% of high-purity feeds, covering the bulk of spam by volume.

#### 4.1.3 Benign Domains
The ODP and Alexa columns show the number of domains in the feed that appeared in the Open Directory Project listings and the Alexa top 1 million websites list. These domains are expected to be benign, and their presence in a feed is likely erroneous. Benign domains may appear in spam for various reasons, such as being included by spammers, inadvertently sent to honeypots, or used as redirection mechanisms. Blacklists, designed to minimize false positives, had the fewest benign domains: only 2% of uribl and less than 1% of dbl intersected with the ODP and Alexa lists.

#### 4.1.4 Removing Impurities
To better understand the useful contributions of each feed, we removed all non-responsive domains and those likely to be benign. Specifically, we retained only domains with at least one successful HTTP response and excluded those listed in ODP and Alexa. This cleaned set, called "live domains," is used for further analysis. Additionally, we removed ODP and Alexa-listed domains from the tagged domains set. Table 3 shows the number of distinct live and tagged domains in each feed.

### 4.2 Coverage
Coverage measures the number of spam domains a feed contains. Greater coverage means more spam filtered in an operational context and more comprehensive results in a measurement study. We consider how coverage varies across our ten spam domain feeds.

#### 4.2.1 Domains
Table 3 shows the number of live and tagged domains in each feed. The human-identified spam domain feed (Hu) contributed the most unique instances, despite having the smallest absolute volume. This is likely due to the provider's large user base, making it a target for many spam campaigns. High-volume campaigns are filtered out, leading to a smaller overall volume.

If one had to choose a single feed for maximum coverage, Hu would be the best choice. However, this data is not widely available. The readily available blacklists (dbl and uribl) are excellent alternatives, providing more tagged domains than any other feed besides Hu.

We also considered exclusive domains, which occur in exactly one feed. Across our feeds, 60% of all live domains and 19% of all tagged domains were exclusive. Table 3 and Figure 1 illustrate the relationship between the number of distinct domains and exclusive domains. The Hu and Hyb feeds made the greatest contribution in terms of both the number of distinct domains and exclusive domains. The number of tagged domains was about an order of magnitude less than the number of live domains, suggesting that spam belonging to specific categories is less common.

### Summary
- **Purity:** Measures the proportion of spam domains in a feed.
- **Non-existent Domains:** Checked via DNS registration and HTTP responses.
- **Known Spam:** Identified through web content tagging.
- **Benign Domains:** Removed using ODP and Alexa lists.
- **Coverage:** Measures the number of spam domains a feed contains.
- **Exclusive Domains:** Domains unique to a single feed.

This structured approach ensures a clear and professional presentation of the data and analysis.
