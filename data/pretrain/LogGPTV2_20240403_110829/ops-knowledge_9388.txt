User: I'm currently working on a stub for tests purpose. Using Python I need to create a process with a specific name ("mysoft") and a specific pid ("1234")
My final purpose is to be able to run the command "pgrep mysoft" on a terminal and get the PID I set (1234).
The process doesn't need to do anything, it just need to exists.
I looked at the subprocess module but I think this is not exactly what I need. What do you think ?
Assistant: You can't create processes with specific PIDs.  The PID is assigned by the OS.
