I want to place this error message to center. This is not possible with
currently. I tried almost every approach.
  * textAlign: TextAlign.center,
is not helping to move error message to center. It moves the input text and
placeholder to center not an error message
We need this in our current design spec. It would be good if you fix it as
early as possible.
Thanks.
