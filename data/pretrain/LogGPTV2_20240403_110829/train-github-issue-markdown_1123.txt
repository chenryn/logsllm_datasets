Subject: Center Alignment for Error Message

Hi Team,

I am encountering an issue with centering the error message as per our current design specifications. Despite trying multiple approaches, I have been unable to achieve the desired result.

- Using `textAlign: TextAlign.center` only centers the input text and placeholder, but not the error message.

This is a critical requirement for our current design, and it would be greatly appreciated if this could be addressed as soon as possible.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
