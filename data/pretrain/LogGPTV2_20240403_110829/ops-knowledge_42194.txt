Certainly! Here is an optimized version of the template extraction:

**Original Log Line:**
```
NIFF: node node-130 has detected an available network connection on network 10.96.0.0 via interface scip0
```

**Extracted Template:**
```
NIFF: node node-<node_id> has detected an available network connection on network <network_address> via interface scip0
```

In this template:
- `<node_id>` represents the unique identifier for the node (e.g., `130`).
- `<network_address>` represents the IP address of the network (e.g., `10.96.0.0`).
