User: I've just installed Python2.6 on CentOS 5. I have to type python26 to run it. If I type  python I get the default Python 2.4. 
Now I need to build a package using python2.6, but it fails because it can't find python-devel. I know python-devel is installed for Python 2.4. How do I install python-devel (or other packages) specifically for Python 2.6?
EDIT
I know on WebFaction they have easy_install2.6 to do this type of thing.
Assistant: You can install a specific version of the package, such as:

yum install python-devel-2.6.2-5.el6.i686

I don't know the exact package version, depends on your CentOS version.
