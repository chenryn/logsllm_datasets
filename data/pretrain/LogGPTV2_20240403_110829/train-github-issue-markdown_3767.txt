Hello,

I would like to propose adding a flag to the `npm init` command that initializes a project with `"type": "module"` in the `package.json` file. Possible flag names could be `--esm`, `--module`, or something similar. 

Would this change be welcomed by the community? If it is as straightforward to implement as I envision, I would be happy to open a pull request for this feature.

Thank you in advance for your consideration!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
