 **Migrated issue, originally created by Anonymous**
The code and docs use "relation" and "relationship" interchangeably as though
they were the same thing, but in relational databases, a relation has a
specific meaning (and is more commonly referred to as a table). This makes
learning SQLAlchemy confusing for people familiar with the relational model
terminology.
This patch renames relation to relationship in the code and docs to avoid this
confusion. Any chance something like this could be applied in a future major
version?
