provides only a rough correlation with guess resistance and
is unable to correctly predict quantitative differences in
guessability among password sets.

APPENDIX
Here we detail the complete training and test data used
in each of our Weir-algorithm experiments. The ﬁrst column
gives the experiment number. The next three columns list the
three types of training data used to create a Weir-calculator
experiment. The structures column shows the wordlists used
to generate the set of character-type structures that deﬁne the
Weir algorithm’s search space. The wordlists in the digits
and symbols column determine the probabilities for ﬁlling
combinations of digits and symbols into these structures. The
wordlists in the strings column determine the probabilities
for ﬁlling alphabetic strings into structures. In most cases,
we train strings on as much data as possible, while restricting
structure and digit/symbol training to wordlists that contain a
quality sample of multi-character-class passwords. The ﬁnal
column describes the password set(s) we attempted to guess.
We also list the complete training and test data used
in each of our BFM experiments. The experiment number
and test set columns are the same as in the Weir subtable.
Training for the BFM calculator, however, uses only one
combined wordlist per experiment; these lists are detailed
in the training set column.
Abbreviations for all the training and test sets we use are
deﬁned in the key below the tables.
