## Abstract

Protocols for authenticated key exchange (AKE) enable parties in an insecure network to establish a shared session key, which can then be used to secure future communications. While two-party AKE is well-studied, group AKE remains less understood, particularly concerning attacks by malicious insiders—a concern unique to the group setting. This work addresses this gap by providing a formal and comprehensive model and definition of security for group AKE that inherently includes insider attacks. We achieve this by defining an appropriate ideal functionality for group AKE within the Universal Composability (UC) framework.

Our contributions include:
1. A formal and comprehensive model for group AKE that accounts for insider attacks.
2. A demonstration that our definition of security is strictly stronger than the one proposed by Bresson et al. (termed "AKE-security").
3. A proof that our definition implies all previously suggested notions of security against insider attacks.
4. A simple technique for converting any AKE-secure protocol into one that is secure according to our definition.

## 1. Introduction

Authenticated key exchange (AKE) protocols allow parties in a completely insecure network to establish a common session key and ensure that they are sharing this key with their intended partners. The two-party AKE has been extensively studied both from a definitional standpoint and in designing efficient protocols. However, the group setting, where a session key is established among more than two parties, is less well understood.

Formal definitional work in the group setting began recently with the introduction of a formal model by Bresson et al. [7, 8, 9], with some modifications by Katz and Yung [23]. These models were based on earlier work in the two-party setting by Bellare, Pointcheval, and Rogaway [2, 3, 5]. We refer to protocols secure in the model of Bresson et al. as "AKE-secure."

AKE-security does not account for protection against insider attacks. In fact, AKE-secure protocols may be completely insecure against such attacks. The lack of a comprehensive and formal model addressing insider attacks has led to several ad-hoc definitions of security [24, 27, 1, 20, 16] and claimed attacks on provably-secure protocols [28, 33, 32, 17]. Recent work by Cachin and Strobl [11] deals with fail-stop faults but not with adversarial (Byzantine) failures. The possibility of insider faults/attacks in the group setting represents a qualitative difference from the two-party setting.

### 1.1 Our Contributions

To better model insider attacks, we introduce definitions of security for group AKE protocols within the Universal Composability (UC) framework [12]. In the UC framework, a cryptographic task is specified via an appropriate ideal-world functionality. A secure protocol is defined as one that adequately mimics this ideal-world functionality. By introducing a suitable ideal functionality for group key exchange, we ensure that any secure protocol will automatically guarantee security against both insider and outsider attacks.

The primary advantage of working within the UC framework is that we only need to specify what we wish a group AKE protocol to achieve, rather than providing a list of attacks to prevent. As a sanity check, we show that any protocol that securely realizes our proposed ideal functionality is also AKE-secure and secure against various insider attacks considered in [27, 16].

Additional advantages of the UC framework include:
1. Protocols proven secure within the UC framework remain secure even when run concurrently with other protocols.
2. The session keys generated by any UC-secure protocol can be securely used by any application.
3. We obtain a definition that guarantees security even in the strong corruption model, where honest players may be compromised at any point during execution.

Although some previous definitions of group AKE describe security against such attacks, none of the mentioned references show a group AKE protocol proven secure in the strong corruption model.

### 1.2 Previous Related Work

The most relevant work is that of Canetti and Krawczyk [14], who consider two-party key exchange within the UC framework. Our work builds on theirs, but our goals differ in that we aim to model insider attacks, which are not a major concern in the two-party setting.

Works that come closest to providing a formal model for analyzing insider attacks on group AKE protocols include [27, 16], which list various security concerns. In contrast, our work provides a single, simple, and comprehensive definition of insider attacks that encompasses all previous definitions.

Steiner [30, Section 5.2] proposes an ideal functionality for group AKE within the Pfitzmann and Waidner framework [26]. Although insider attacks were not the specific focus, it is claimed that protocols securely realizing the given ideal functionality are also secure against certain classes of insider attacks. Arguably, the ideal functionality defined in this work is simpler and more straightforward than the one given in [30]. Furthermore, while a specific O(n)-round protocol is proven secure in [30], no generic method for constructing secure protocols is provided.

## 2. AKE-Security

Here, we review the notion of "AKE-security" along the lines of [7, 8, 9, 23] with some modifications. We then formally introduce two notions of security against insider attacks, which may be of independent interest as they appear to be the first formal definitions of such attacks. We conclude this section by showing that AKE-security does not imply security against either of these attacks, motivating our subsequent introduction of a new framework that adequately handles such attacks.

### Participants and Initialization

There is a fixed set of n players \( U = \{U_1, \ldots, U_n\} \). Any subset of these players may run the group AKE protocol at any time (possibly concurrently) to share a session key. During an initialization phase, each player \( U \) runs a key-generation algorithm \( G(1^k) \) to generate a long-term public/secret key pair \((PK_U, SK_U)\). Player \( U \) keeps the secret key \( SK_U \) private, and the public key \( PK_U \) is known to all other participants and the adversary.

We assume that all long-term keys are honestly-generated, equivalent to assuming no players are corrupted before the initialization phase concludes. This assumption is for simplicity; our analysis in Section 4.2 does not rely on it.

### Session IDs, Partner IDs, and Related Notions

Each player \( U \in U \) can run the protocol multiple times, and each instance is identified by a session ID. The partner ID identifies the set of players with whom \( U \) is attempting to establish a session key.
