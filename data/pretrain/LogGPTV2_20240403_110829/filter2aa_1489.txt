SCOUT:
NOW EVERYONE CAN GET
INTO THE NUCLEAR ARMS
RACE
WHAT IS A HACKER
• SOMEONE VERY CREATIVE
• AN EXPLORER
• REVERSE ENGINEER
• SOMEONE WHO DOES’T HAVE A BOX
TO THINK OUT OF
• DOESN’T DRINK THE KOOLAIDE
• BOLDLY GOES WHERE NO MAN HAS
GONE BEFORE
RADIATION, GAMMA RAYS
• HIGH ENERGY PHOTONS
• CESIUM 137
• COBALT 60
NEUTRONS
• PRODUCED BY A REACTOR
• NO CHARGE
• CAN MAKE ELEMENTS RADIOACTIVE
RADIATION,ALPHA,BETA,
PARTICLES
• ALPHA PARTICLES, HELIUM NUCLEUS
+2 CHARGE
• BETA PARTICLES, ELECTRON ,-1
CHARGE
• ONLY DANGEROUS IF INHALED OR
INGESTED
 ATTACKS IN THE PAST THAT
COULD HAVE UTILIZED
• RUSSIAN POLONIUM 210 INGESTION
•  IN 1984 THE FOLLOWERS OF
BHAGWAN SHREE RAJNEESH
SPRAYED SALMONELLA INTO SALAD
BARS IN ANTELOPE COUNTRY
• IN 1966-7 THE CIA AND DEFENSE
DEPT SPRAYED A HARMLESS
SUBSTANCE ON TO THE TRACKS OF
TWO NYC SUBWAY LINES
PASITIVE DETECTORS
• GEIGER COUNTER
• ION CHAMBER SURVEY
• GAMMA SCINTILLATION DETECTOR
• COUNTER  MEASURES
ACTIVE DETECTORS
• ILUMINATE  OBJECTS  WITH
NEUTRONS OR GAMMA RAYS
• NUCLEAR INTERESTING OBJECT WILL
PRODUCE NEUTRONS
• COUNTER MEASSURES NONE
• DRAWBACKS, IT MIGHT SET OFF A
CRUDLEY MADE ATOM BOMB
OVER VIEW OF DAVID HAHN
• LIVES IN  A SUBURB  OF DETROIT
• BOY SCOUT,ATOMIC ENERGY MERIT
BADGE
SOCIAL ENGINEER
• PROFESSOR HAHN
• CZECH REPUBLIC,SAMPLES
URANINITE AND PITCHBLEND
• PROFESSOR PHYSICS INSTRUCTOR
CON SOME GOVERNMENT OFFICALS
• RECEIVED A REPLY FROM ONE OUT
OF 5 LETTERS
• LEARNED FROM GOVERNMENT
BERYLLIUM PRODUCES NEUTRONS
DAVID HAHN THE CHEMIST
• GOLDEN BOOK OF CHEMISTRY
EXPERIMENTS
• GUN POWER
• NITRIC ACID
• YELLOW CAKE
THE QUEST FOR FISSIONABLE
FUEL
• URANIUM-235,233,PLUTONIUM-239,240
• THORIUM-232 BECOMES 233 +
NEUTRON
• LANTERN MANTELS CONTAIN
THORIUM
• COPIOUS AMOUNT OF MANTELS
THE NEUTRON GUN
• A DEVICE TO TRANSFORM ELEMENTS
• ALPHA PARTICLES FIRED AT
ALUMINUM OR BERYLLIUM PRODUCE
NEUTRONS
• AMERICIUM 241 FOUND IN SMOKE
DETECTORS PRODUCES ALPHA
PARTICLES
• NEED AT LEAST 100 DETECTORS
NEUTRON GUN 2
• RADIUM- USED AS A PAINT ON CLOCK
FACES
REACTOR START UP
• NEUTRON GUN BECOMES CORE OF
THE REACTOR
• TINY FOIL WRAPPEDCUBES
CONTAINING THORIUM
• CUBES CONTAINING CARBON
• OUTER LAYER OF THORIUM
• SHOE BOX SIZE ABOUT 4500 GRAMS
SCRAM
• NO CONTROL RODS
• GETTING MORE RADIOACTIVE DAY
BY DAY
• DETECTING RADIATION FROM FIVE
HOUSES DOWN
• PUT MOST OF THE REACTOR PARTS
IN A TOOLBOX
DAVID’S DEVICE VS THE NAZI
URANIUM ENGINER
• NO CONTROL RODS
• RADIATION BUILDS UP SLOWLY
• MUST BE DISASEMBLED TO STOP
• CAN EXPLODED FROM PRESSURE
BUILD UP
WHAT I THINK
• 3-5  WORLD WIDE HOBBYIST, MAYBE,
30-50 AFTER I FINISH THIS TALK
• NOT POLITICAL
• 1000 TO 1, 1,000,000 TO 1,
IMPROVEMENT CAN  BE
REENGINEER BY HIS DESIGN
WHAT WE DON’T KNOW
• NEUTRON FLUX
• GAMMER RAY VALUE
• ALL HIS NOTE BOOKS WERE BURNED
WHAT WE KNOW
• THE EPA DIDN’T GET THE GOOD
STUFF
• THE GARBAGE GOT THE
RADIOACTIVE GOOD STUFF
HOMELAND SECURITY MODEL
• COBALT 60, CESIUM 137
• PENCIL
• HIGH EXPLOSIVE
• MAYBE THIS IS A DISINFORMATION
MODEL
• COULD HOMELAND SECURITY BE
SMARTER THAN WE THINK
NUCLEAR HACKER BECOMES A
TERRORIST
• WHAT TO DO WITH A HOT
RADIOACTIVE SOURCE  COBALT
60,CESIUM 137
SEED CORN TO MAKE OTHER
THINGS RADIOACTIVE
• NANO SIZE
• 1-100NM,
• HUMAN HAIR80,000 – 90,000NM
• RED BLOOD CELL 7,000NM
• PASS HEPA FILTER
• INERT COMPOUNDS MAY BE TOXIC
AT THE NANO SIZE LEVEL
BUILD THE PERFECT DIRTY
BOMB
• NANO SIZE
• NRC TOOLBOX
• MULTIPE BOMBS OF DIFFERENT SIZES
• ONLY BLACK POWDER IS NEEDED
STRATEGIC TARGETS
• FIRE DEPT HAZMAT TRUCK
•  DECON SHOWER TRUCKS
• HAZ-MAT 1
• NYPD HAZMAT AT ESU base (Floyd
Bennett Field )
WHAT CAN SET OFF A
RADIATION ALARM
• URAINUM MINERALS
• RADIOLOGICAL
PROCDURES,SPECT,PET SCAN
• RADIOACTIVE DRUGS
• RADIO SEEDS
MY RADIATION ALARM GOES
OFF ON THE A TRAIN
• 911 CALL
• NYC INFORMATION HOT LINE THEY
DON’T KNOW THE WORD “RADIATION”
• CALL TO NYPD TERRORIST HOT LINE
WHAT THEY DIDN’T ASK ON
THE HOT LINE
• DETECTOR SATURATION
• HIGHEST READING
• NEAR FOOD STUFFS
WHAT I HAVE OBSERVED
• IN THE PAST 22 MONTHS ALL
HOT(10,000 CPS) URANIUM MINERALS
HAVE DISAPEARED FROM THE
MARKET
NOW IT GET REALLY SCARY
• NEXT SLIDE IF YOU CAN TAKE IT
9/11 DISINFORMATION
• THE GOVERNMENT TOLD RESCUERS
IT WAS SAFE AT GROUND ZERO
• WHAT HAPPENS IF A TERRORIST
BOMBS A VERY CRITICAL LOCATION.
• THE GOVERMENT SAYS IT IS SAFE
• THE MEDIA SAVVY TERRORIST SAY IT
ISN’T
THE 10 KILOTON BOMB
WITH SALT HOLD THE PEPER
