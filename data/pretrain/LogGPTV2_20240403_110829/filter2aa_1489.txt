# The Radioactive Boy Scout: A Case Study in Nuclear Hacking

## Introduction
The story of the "Radioactive Boy Scout" highlights how anyone, with enough determination and creativity, can delve into the world of nuclear science. This case study explores the actions of David Hahn, a young man from Detroit who attempted to build a nuclear reactor in his backyard.

## What is a Hacker?
- **Creative Individual**: Someone who thinks outside the box.
- **Explorer**: An individual driven by curiosity and a desire to discover new things.
- **Reverse Engineer**: A person who deconstructs systems to understand their inner workings.
- **Innovator**: Someone who does not conform to conventional thinking.
- **Skeptic**: A person who questions established norms and does not accept information at face value.
- **Pioneer**: An individual who ventures into uncharted territories.

## Radiation and Its Types
### Gamma Rays
- **High-Energy Photons**
- **Sources**: Cesium-137, Cobalt-60

### Neutrons
- **Produced by Reactors**
- **Chargeless Particles**
- **Can Induce Radioactivity in Elements**

### Alpha and Beta Particles
- **Alpha Particles**: Helium nucleus with a +2 charge
- **Beta Particles**: Electrons with a -1 charge
- **Harmful if Inhaled or Ingested**

## Notable Attacks
- **Russian Polonium-210 Poisoning**
- **1984 Rajneesh Cult Salmonella Attack** in Oregon
- **1966-197 CIA and Defense Department Substances Sprayed** on NYC Subway Lines

## Detection Methods
### Passive Detectors
- **Geiger Counter**
- **Ion Chamber Survey**
- **Gamma Scintillation Detector**

### Active Detectors
- **Illumination with Neutrons or Gamma Rays**
- **Nuclear Materials Produce Neutrons**
- **Drawbacks**: May trigger a crude atomic bomb

## Overview of David Hahn
- **Residence**: Suburb of Detroit
- **Background**: Boy Scout, Atomic Energy Merit Badge

## Social Engineering
- **Professors and Government Officials**: Convinced to provide information
- **Received Responses to 1 out of 5 Letters**
- **Learned about Beryllium Producing Neutrons**

## David Hahn as a Chemist
- **Golden Book of Chemistry Experiments**
- **Materials Used**: Gunpowder, Nitric Acid, Yellow Cake (Uranium)

## Quest for Fissionable Fuel
- **Fissionable Isotopes**: Uranium-235, Uranium-233, Plutonium-239, Plutonium-240
- **Thorium-232**: Becomes Thorium-233 when hit by a neutron
- **Lantern Mantles**: Contain Thorium

## The Neutron Gun
- **Device to Transform Elements**
- **Alpha Particles Fired at Aluminum or Beryllium Produce Neutrons**
- **Americium-241 in Smoke Detectors Produces Alpha Particles**
- **Required Quantity**: At least 100 detectors

### Neutron Gun 2
- **Radium**: Used in clock faces

## Reactor Startup
- **Core**: Neutron gun
- **Components**: Tiny foil-wrapped cubes containing Thorium, Carbon, and an outer layer of Thorium
- **Size**: Shoebox, approximately 4500 grams

## SCRAM (Emergency Shutdown)
- **No Control Rods**
- **Increasing Radioactivity Daily**
- **Detected Radiation from Five Houses Away**
- **Stored Reactor Parts in a Toolbox**

### Comparison with Nazi Uranium Engine
- **No Control Rods**
- **Slow Build-Up of Radiation**
- **Disassembly Required to Stop**
- **Risk of Explosion from Pressure Build-Up**

## Reflections
- **Global Hobbyists**: 3-5 currently, potentially 30-50 after this talk
- **Non-Political Intentions**
- **Potential for Improvement and Reengineering**

## Unknowns
- **Neutron Flux and Gamma Ray Values**
- **All Notebooks Burned**

## Known Facts
- **EPA Did Not Retrieve All Radioactive Materials**
- **Garbage Contained Radioactive Waste**

## Homeland Security Model
- **Cobalt-60, Cesium-137**
- **High Explosives**
- **Possible Disinformation Model**
- **Homeland Security's Intelligence**

## Nuclear Hacker to Terrorist
- **Handling Radioactive Sources**: Cobalt-60, Cesium-137
- **Nano-Scale Materials**: 1-100 nm
- **Toxicity at Nano-Scale**

## Building the Perfect Dirty Bomb
- **Nano-Scale Components**
- **NRC Toolbox**
- **Multiple Bombs of Different Sizes**
- **Black Powder Sufficient**

### Strategic Targets
- **Fire Department Hazmat Trucks**
- **Decon Shower Trucks**
- **NYPD Hazmat Units**

## Radiation Alarm Triggers
- **Uranium Minerals**
- **Radiological Procedures**: SPECT, PET Scan
- **Radioactive Drugs**
- **Radio Seeds**

### Personal Experience
- **Radiation Alarm on the A Train**
- **911 Call**
- **NYC Information Hotline**
- **NYPD Terrorist Hotline**

### Missing Information
- **Detector Saturation**
- **Highest Reading**
- **Proximity to Foodstuffs**

### Observations
- **Disappearance of High-Activity Uranium Minerals from the Market**

## Future Concerns
- **Government Misinformation Post-9/11**
- **Terrorist Bombings and Government Response**
- **Media Manipulation by Terrorists**

### Hypothetical Scenario
- **10 Kiloton Bomb with Salt**
- **Radioactive Isotopes**: Cobalt-60 (5.27 years), Cesium-137 (30.2 years), Zinc-65 (244 days)
