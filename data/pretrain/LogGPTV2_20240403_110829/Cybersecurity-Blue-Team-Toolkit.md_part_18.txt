three different styles of graphs you can use: line, impulse, and dots.
If you are graphing multiple items, you can choose different styles for
each graph.

WHAT YOU WILL LEARN IN THIS CHAPTER:
-   [Authentication, Authorization, and
    Auditing]{#c08.xhtml#c08-li-0001}
-   [Least Privilege]{#c08.xhtml#c08-li-0002}

Let\'s take a trip through an airport. You have to produce
identification to authenticate you are who you say you are. Then you
have to provide a ticket to an agent to access the boarding area. Your
belongings are screened to make sure you\'re not bringing any malicious
contraband with you into a secured area. When you board the plane, they
scan your ticket to prove you gained access to the aircraft. Now the
airline can track and audit if and when you traveled. This is
fundamental access management. Now take the same concept and apply it to
a networked environment.
With all these layers of access management, how often do we hear of
people getting past security? What other layers of security are in place
at an airport that you have not even considered? As a security
professional, you become acutely aware of those layers of defense in
depth. You always have to be thinking strategically and protectively and
asking targeted questions. What if someone is impersonating another on
my network? What if someone has too much access? What if someone does
access the network but has brought ransomware along?
Access management makes system or network administrators think about how
people log into their computers and network. Most users don\'t realize
there is a difference between logging in with domain credentials versus
logging directly into an asset. Many users don\'t realize there are
different levels of access. They believe what you see is what you get
(WYSIWYG).
[]{#c08.xhtml#Page_98 .pagebreak title="98" role="doc-pagebreak"}Access
management is the process of identifying, controlling, managing, and
auditing authorized users\' access to any asset you manage. Typically in
IT, asset management (AM) is used in conjunction with identity
management (IM). IM creates and provisions different users, roles,
groups, and policies where AM ensures that the security guidelines,
procedures, and policies are followed.
There are many different organizations selling IM/AM solutions today.
Picking a solution is not easy. You have to keep in mind scalability,
performance, and usability. Close‐sourced solutions can hamper your
ability to adapt applications to your specific requirements and total
cost of ownership becomes high. Open‐ source management can give you
freedom to make good business decisions, customize it for unique
situations, and have low or no maintenance fees, but it can be difficult
to implement. Not only do you have to manage IM/AM, you have to add
least privilege into the equation. The practice of least privilege is
limiting access rights of users to only what they need to get the job
done. Josh Franz, a security consultant at Rapid7, says, "Simply put, if
you don\'t have identity access management in your company, you do not
have security. All the security controls in the world won\'t stop an
attacker if everyone on your network is a domain admin."

## AAA {#c08.xhtml#head-2-56}
Authentication, authorization, and auditing (AAA) are often used
together in cybersecurity when it comes to how someone gains access to a
system. Authentication and authorization are critical topics often
confused, but they are different from each other. Authentication is
confirming who you are, while authorization means verifying what you
have access to. Authentication is usually a username or ID and a
password but could also be something you have like a token or something
you are like a fingerprint.
Based on your security policies, you and your organization may need
different levels of authentication.
-   [Single‐factor---easiest authentication, usually a simple password
    to grant access to a system or domain.]{#c08.xhtml#c08-li-0005}
-   [Two‐factor---two‐step verification that results in more security.
    When you visit the bank to withdraw money from an ATM, you need both
    a physical card and a personal identification number
    (PIN).]{#c08.xhtml#c08-li-0006}
-   [Multifactor---the most secure type of authentication to grant
    access, using two or more techniques from different
    categories.]{#c08.xhtml#c08-li-0007}
Authorization happens after you have been authenticated. In the
two‐factor analogy, after using the ATM card and PIN, you get access to
your money, and only your money. Authorization determines your ability
to access what []{#c08.xhtml#Page_99 .pagebreak title="99"
role="doc-pagebreak"}systems and which accounts are you able to withdraw
money from. This is a key component to access policy.
Auditing (some say the third *A* is accounting) is used to make sure the
controls put in place are working. Auditing is used to support
accounting. Auditing is the logging of events that have significance
such as who has logged in and logged out or who attempted some type of
privileged action. Monitoring can help make sure that there are no
malicious activities happening in the environment. If you are looking to
prove someone did something on your network, audit and security logs are
the absolute best files to maintain that someone or something performed
an action in a networked environment.
Another important part of auditing and accounting is nonrepudiation.
Nonrepudiation means that the person authenticated and authorized cannot
deny the performance of an action. You do not want a situation where one
person claims an action happened and another is in total opposition to
the story. A traditional example of nonrepudiation is a signature you
received a document. In cybersecurity, nonrepudiation requires the
creation of certain artifacts such as the following:
-   [An identity]{#c08.xhtml#c08-li-0008}
-   [Authentication of that identity]{#c08.xhtml#c08-li-0009}
-   [Evidence connecting that identity to an
    action]{#c08.xhtml#c08-li-0010}

## Least Privilege {#c08.xhtml#head-2-57}
If you ever take a certification exam, you may see this as principle of
least privilege (PoLP) and even principle of least authority (PoLA). It
is a concept that reduces the accidental or purposeful attack surface of
an organization. There are several ways through access management you
can use this concept to protect your ecosystem. In IT, we learn from
others\' mistakes.
About a decade ago, I was an administrator on a network with about
12,000 machines and 9,000 users. We used Group Policy in Windows to
control the working environment. It was a way to centralize management
of users\' settings, applications, and operating systems in an Active
Directory environment. We had someone new to the organization who was
full of great ideas but was not aware of or willing to follow the change
management procedures we had put in place to safeguard the network.
He changed a major feature in Group Policy that had catastrophic
results. In the Event Viewer on a Windows machine you can configure your
security logs. He checked the box to not overwrite security logs and
pushed it out to 12,000 machines using Group Policy objects. If you\'ve
been IT for a while, you might be cringing. Within 24 hours, he had
locked out 9,000 users on our network by []{#c08.xhtml#Page_100
.pagebreak title="100" role="doc-pagebreak"}filling up the allotted log
space for successful and failed logon/logoff events. Thankfully, we were
able to fix the problem within about 30 minutes after we had figured out
what had happened. At first, we had thought we were under attack.
Through nonrepudiation, we knew which admin had been logged into the
system when the change occurred.
Here are the morals of this story:
-   [If you\'re not sure what you\'re doing, then
    ask.]{#c08.xhtml#c08-li-0011}
-   [Just because you can doesn\'t mean you
    should.]{#c08.xhtml#c08-li-0012}
-   [If you limit who has access to critical systems, you reduce your
    attack surface.]{#c08.xhtml#c08-li-0013}
Most devices have mechanisms built in where you have standard end‐user
and administrator accounts. Administrator accounts are for users who
need full access to all areas of the machine where user accounts are
restricted; users can run applications but do not have full
administrative access.
One reason this principle works so well is that it will make you do
internal research on what privileges at what level are actually needed.
Unfortunately, the path of least resistance in many organizations has
been the overuse of accounts with deep and far‐reaching privilege. The
consequences of a network administrator opening an email attachment that
launches malware while logged into the domain administrator\'s account
are that the malware will have administrator\'s privilege on the domain
and unrestricted access to the network. If the network administrator is
logged into a standard end‐user account, the malware only has access to
the user\'s data, and the potential compromise scope is much smaller.
You should default to creating a separate standard user account for
every user including administrators, and every account should use at
least single‐factor authentication. This enables you to control what the
users can install and websites they can visit. Too many organizations
allow all users on their network administrative privileges, and it
creates a massive attack surface. Administrators should always log in
using their standard user account and then use the Run As Administrator
feature to run those programs they need elevated privileges to use.
There are far too many breaches that get traced back to administrators
opening email and clicking a link that leads to a malicious download
that compromises an asset that spreads through a network and steals
everything. Not only do organizations lose intellectual property, but
they end up fined for violations of compliance, which can lead to a loss
of millions in a single breach.
One of the best ways to start implementing the PoLP is to start with a
privileged audit. A user account created to use a database does not need
admin rights like a programmer building the database. You do not want to
hinder your end users; you want to give them only enough access to
perform their required job.
[]{#c08.xhtml#Page_101 .pagebreak title="101" role="doc-pagebreak"}Do an
audit of privilege on a regular basis. This is not a one‐and‐done
exercise. It is operational. Who has access to what, and who has changed
jobs and retained access to their old permissions?
Start every account as low as possible. Only add higher permissions if
needed/requested and only for the time needed. An auditor may need
elevated privileges but only for the duration of the audit.
Separation of duties (SoD) is a strategic function of least privilege.
You have one person write the check and one person sign the check. By
having more than one person accomplish a task, it can help prevent fraud
or errors. In the Group Policy story earlier, SoD was part of that
process. If the employee had followed procedures for change management,
I could have told him why it was a really bad idea.
By implementing least privilege, you can even improve operational
performance, reduce the chance of unauthorized behavior, reduce the
attack surface, and reduce the chances of malicious software propagating
since it might need elevated processes to run. One of the biggest
benefits of implementing least privilege is that it makes it easier to
meet compliance requirements. Many compliance regulations such as
PCI‐DSS, HIPAA, FISMA, and SOX require that organizations apply least
privilege to ensure proper data management and security.
The Federal Desktop Core Configuration requirements by the National
Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST) say that federal
employees must log into PCs with standard privileges. PCI‐DSS 3.0 7.2.2
requires assignment of privileges to individuals based on job
classification and function.

## Single Sign‐On {#c08.xhtml#head-2-58}
Working in our modern‐day environments requires us to log into multiple
programs to get our jobs done. We have to log into customer management
databases, share resources in cloud applications, check email, and
create documentation online. It can be a headache for the average user
to remember all those usernames and passwords. To alleviate that issue,
we use single sign‐on (SSO) applications. SSO is another form of access
control between multiple, interrelated software systems.
Benefits of single sign‐on can include the reduction of password fatigue
or having end users write their passwords on sticky notes and put them
on their monitor or under the keyboard. It can save time typing in
passwords over and over and ideally reduce help‐desk issues of people
calling in because they went on vacation and forgot their password and
locked themselves out. One of the big criticisms of SSO is the access to
many different resources from just one login. []{#c08.xhtml#Page_102
.pagebreak title="102" role="doc-pagebreak"}To combat this issue, we
have to focus on protecting the "keys to the kingdom" and combine this
with strong verification like multifactor authentication.
The CIA triad shown in [Figure
8.1](#c08.xhtml#c08-fig-0001){#c08.xhtml#R_c08-fig-0001} is used to find
the right balance for an organization based on priorities. Some
organizations like the military\'s preference toward confidentiality,
where organizations such as Amazon might lean toward availability. After
all, the military does not want its secrets leaked, and you cannot
purchase from a website if the site is down.
![[**[Figure 8.1](#c08.xhtml#R_c08-fig-0001){#c08.xhtml#c08-fig-0001
role="doc-backlink"}:**]{.figureLabel} CIA
triad](Images/c08f001.jpg){.center width="370" height="374"}
Confidentiality is a set of rules that limit access to information,
integrity is the assurance that the information is accurate, and
availability is giving the right information access to the right people.
Network and security IT administrators have to find a balance between
protecting the environment and meeting compliance without hindering the
workflow of the end users. If you tighten controls too tight, users
cannot do their job, but if controls are too lax, it results in a
vulnerability. If you\'re not careful, end users will start saving their
credentials in their browser for easy login into their favorite banking
or shopping websites. They may even save their corporate credentials,
which could be catastrophic if the machine is ever accessed by
non‐authorized individuals.
As a security leader in your organization, you have decisions to make.
The problem with making decisions today is your enterprise will mostly
likely change tomorrow. Most of the processes we use in IT are cyclic,
always subject to reevaluation. When your security maturity model
reaches the point where building and documenting AAA, least privilege,
