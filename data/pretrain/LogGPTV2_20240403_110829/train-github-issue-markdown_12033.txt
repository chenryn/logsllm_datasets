I have identified a text rendering issue in the following section of the code:

[mapbox-gl-native/blob/master/src/clipper/clipper.cpp#L4336-L4340](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/blob/master/src/clipper/clipper.cpp#L4336-L4340)

The issue appears as shown in the attached screenshot, where question marks are displayed instead of the correct characters.

However, the same code renders correctly on GitHub. 

For your reference, I am using:
- Ubuntu 14.04 (64-bit)
- Atom 0.152.0

Please let me know if you need any further information or assistance to resolve this issue.
