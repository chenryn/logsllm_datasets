Question: In reviewing the design of a cloud service's permission structure, you observe that serverless functions have been granted the 'IAM:PassRole' permission in AWS. What could be a potential security implication of this configuration?
"A": "It would allow serverless functions to improve performance by adjusting resource allocation automatically.",
"B": "It could enable adversaries to add additional cloud roles to serverless functions, increasing their privileges.",
"C": "It would restrict serverless functions from accessing necessary resources, leading to service disruption.",
"D": "It could optimize cost by automatically scaling down unused serverless resources."
Answer: B
