ABSTRACT
Nowadays, collaborations between industrial companies always go
hand in hand with trust issues, i.e., exchanging valuable production
data entails the risk of improper use of potentially sensitive infor-
mation. Therefore, companies hesitate to offer their production
data, e.g., process parameters that would allow other companies
to establish new production lines faster, against a quid pro quo.
Nevertheless, the expected benefits of industrial collaboration, data
exchanges, and the utilization of external knowledge are significant.
In this paper, we introduce our Bloom filter-based Parameter
Exchange (BPE), which enables companies to exchange process
parameters privacy-preservingly. We demonstrate the applicability
of our platform based on two distinct real-world use cases: injection
molding and machine tools. We show that BPE is both scalable and
deployable for different needs to foster industrial collaborations.
Thereby, we reward data-providing companies with payments while
preserving their valuable data and reducing the risks of data leakage.

1 INTRODUCTION
The impact of the Internet of Things (IoT) across various areas, e.g.,
the Industrial IoT (IIoT) and cyber-physical systems (CPSs), has led
to a vastly increased sensor-based collection of production data
that is not only used for their original purpose but also collected for
further analyses [20, 40, 69]. Therefore, companies can utilize this
analyzed data to improve their production processes, e.g., by feed-
ing back results to optimize process parameters [32, 62]. In theory,
sharing such data could be especially useful for quick adjustments
to address customer change requests [56] or the cheaper commis-
sioning of production lines [61]. Still, plenty of information is only
retained locally [44], i.e., stored in data silos [33], hindering the
entirety of companies to profit from already analyzed parameters.
Novel concepts, such as the Internet of Production (IoP) [33, 55],
propose to further facilitate collaborations to utilize external knowl-
edge. However, these advances are hindered by the lack of suitable
solutions that consider industry needs [40], i.e., a prevention of
sensitive information leakage on data provider as well as on the
client-side and a valuable reward for providing data. Existing solu-
tions [8, 9, 17, 21, 24, 77] either do not consider the privacy of the
data-providing companies, do not take multiple data providers into
account, or do not value the privacy of data requesting companies.
To counter this unsatisfying situation, we propose an exchange
platform which allows companies to privacy-preservingly retrieve
valuable (external) data. Motivated by a real-world use case in the
domain of injection molding, we first explicitly specify the plat-
form’s general functionality. Moreover, we consider the already
outlined industry needs, i.e., data provider privacy to not leak any
confidential information within the shared data as well as client pri-
vacy to not reveal any future or current business plans through sub-
mitted requests, and a proper reward system to instigate companies
to exchange their valuable data. Thereby, our platform facilitates
the privacy-preserving exchange of production data in various do-
mains and enables novel use cases, e.g., as introduced by the IoP, and
unlocks new business models for participating data-providing com-
panies as the value of data is widely acknowledged [33, 40, 56, 69].
However, a suitable concept for industrial data exchanges not
only has to address privacy concerns but must also scale to its needs.
Hence, we make use of (cryptographic) building blocks whose appli-
cability has significantly improved [2, 57, 63, 66, 67]. In particular,
we use Bloom filters and oblivious transfers to build a universal
design called BPE, which we evaluate with two real-world use cases.

• We demonstrate the applicability of our approach in different
scenarios and evaluate two real-world use cases: (i) a process
parameter retrieval for injection molding to reduce the ramp-
up phase of new production lines, and (ii) an exchange to
improve the machine tool settings for individual workpieces.
Organization. In Section 2, we present our scenario illustrated
with a suitable application in injection molding. Then, we introduce
our design goals (Section 3) and used building blocks (Section 4). In
Section 5, we detail our design of BPE and present our implementa-
tion in Section 6. We demonstrate its performance and applicability
(incl. machine tool use case) in Section 7. We further discuss its secu-
rity and additional design variants in Section 8. Then, in Section 9,
we present related work and conclude our paper in Section 10.
2 SCENARIO
In this section, we motivate the need for a privacy-preserving pa-
rameter exchange by shorter ramp-up phases of new product lines
in an injection molding use case and further introduce the benefits
of such an exchange in general. Subsequently, we derive challenges
that stem from the sensitivity of potentially shared information.
2.1 Transfer Learning for Injection Molding
The selection of injection molding (IM) processes as our starting
point for deriving the benefits of a parameter exchange is based on
their importance in thermoplastics. IM is responsible for the pro-
cessing of around 55 Mio. tons of polymer materials worldwide each
year, which grosses to 16.42 % of yearly polymer production [14, 58].
Production Process. The production is discontinuous. Polymer
granulate is fed into a barrel in which a screw rotates, superposed
with a translational drawback movement. The friction generated
by motion between granulate, melt, screw, and barrel surfaces as
well as heat introduced by heater bands around the barrel cause the
plasticizing of the material along the axial transport to the screw
tip. The screw anteroom fills during the drawback, accumulating
material for the injection phase. During injection, the screw serves
as a piston, injecting the polymer melt under high pressure into the
cavity of an actively cooled mold. Once the volumetric fill of the
cavity is concluded, the pressure-defined packing phase starts. The
machine presses material into the cavity to compensate volumetric
shrinkage occurring during the cooling process. Eventually, the
closed mold opens and allows the ejection of the solidified part.
During cooling, the machine recuperated the injected material in
the screw anteroom, ready for the next production cycle [52].
Identifying Parameters. In this highly complex environment,
a major challenge is to determine an optimized set of IM-machine
parameters during the process setup. Suboptimal processes yield
a higher scrap rate, resulting in lower part quality, or consuming

more energy during (mass) production. While arbitrary optimiza-
tion by expert knowledge [11, 47], i.e., by trial-and-error, or process-
oriented optimization by simulation [6, 10, 34] is widespread, ob-
jective optimization can be achieved with unbiased mathematical
approaches such as artificial neural networks (ANNs). ANNs are
vastly audited methods to model the correspondence between IM-
machine and process parameters as input and part quality parame-
ters as output [15, 75, 83, 90, 92]. Models are used by evolutionary
algorithms [47, 73, 84] or particle-swarm algorithms [1, 6, 43, 79],
or to derive an optimized parameter set for (mass) production.
Transfer Learning. However, even shallow ANNs usually re-
quire an amount of training data, which is rarely obtainable during
production, rendering ANNs unattractive for this use case. Transfer
learning could mitigate this downside. In terms of machine learning,
it defines the transfer of knowledge from a source assignment 𝐴𝑆,
consisting of a source domain 𝐷𝑆 and a source task 𝑇𝑆, to a target
assignment 𝐴𝑇 [87]. A domain 𝐷 describes the data origin with a
defined feature set 𝑋 and a belonging probability distribution 𝑃(𝑋).
A task 𝑇 , on the contrary, is determined by the output parameter
space 𝑌 and the mapping 𝑓 (𝑋) with 𝑓 : 𝑋 → 𝑌.
While different transfer learning approaches have been identi-
fied [53, 87], network-based transfers have been validated when
correlating IM-machine and part quality parameters. Especially the
transfer between simulation and experimental data is intensively
researched and also implemented as demonstrators [37, 38, 48, 82].
The network-based transfer considers a pre-trained model 𝑓𝑆(𝑌𝑆)
which has been fitted by abundant labeled samples (𝑥𝑆, 𝑦𝑆) from a
source domain 𝐷𝑆. Then, 𝑓𝑆(𝑌𝑆) is transferred to a target task 𝑇𝑇 .
Here, as little as possible training data (𝑥𝑇 , 𝑦𝑇) to achieve a good
model is desired. However, simulations have to be rerun if influ-
ences on the IM process, such as the material or the part change,
introducing a high repetitiveness. Especially the successful transfer
of knowledge between processes with varying influencing parame-
ters make transfer learning a real alternative to expert knowledge.
The transfer between processes of different molded parts indicates
promising results [36], suggesting a close correlation of the transfer
learning success with the similarity of source and target domain.
A Lack of Models. When preparing for process modeling, suit-
able data or models might only be available at other, unaffiliated
companies. However, customer interests and legal boundaries as
well as the desire to retain a maximum of process information as
proprietary information conflict with the availability and publica-
tion of production data in general [54, 56] and also in the field of
plastics processing [45]. However, advances in data acquisition and
availability on the own enterprise in terms of Industry 4.0 expedite
the need for new business models and value streams. A reasonable
compensation as well as a proper separation of relevant process
data and customer information can possibly motivate enterprises
to assume a role as data provider. Hence, a privacy-preserving pa-
rameter exchange would be highly beneficial for the establishment
of data-driven methods for process optimization in manufacturing.
2.2 Production Process Parameter Exchange
We use injection molding as an example showing that utilizing pro-
duction data across organizational boundaries is a desirable aspect
of the future production landscape. Figure 1 shows a workflow of

want to share their interest. To still achieve a competitive advan-
tage, the utilization of requested and retrieved data must remain
private, including the process of identifying relevant data items.
Industrial Setting. Additional challenges originate from the
industrial setting. In contrast to the analysis of personal data, com-
panies impose very strict usage rules [94], e.g., molds are regularly
owned by customers of injection molding manufacturers and only
loaned to the companies for production. Therefore, any uninten-
tional disclosure of intellectual property has to be strictly avoided.
For example, in injection molding, geometrical data of produced
parts is needed for the calculation of similarity scores. Hence, it
should remain private if not shared or sold on purpose. Establishing
trust in a single third party is highly unlikely as companies strive to
limit the threat of data leaks [72]. Regardless, creating new business
models for companies with existing data repositories could incen-
tivize their participation [94], i.e., a privacy-preserving exchange
could open up a new stream of revenue for data-providing compa-
nies. Consequentially, a suitable billing mechanism is required.
Operational Considerations. Given that privacy-preserving
designs and security building blocks usually introduce a compu-
tational overhead and possibly add communication [88], the data
exchange must be executed within reasonable, use case-induced
boundaries. This aspect is not limited to the exchange, but also in-
cludes a potential setup. In particular, various security and privacy
guarantees might directly contradict the feasibility of a proposed
concept. Furthermore, data-providing companies might not be able
to participate in data exchanges and their associated protocols.
Hence, flexibility is needed to also account for such situations.
Based on the example of injection molding, we discussed the value of
production data and the benefits of utilizing external information, i.e.,
we discovered reasons for inter-organizational data exchanges. Here,
