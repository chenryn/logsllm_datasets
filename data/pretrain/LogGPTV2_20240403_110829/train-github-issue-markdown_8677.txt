### Version
2.4.2
### Reproduction link
https://codepen.io/horan/pen/RZpKzP
### Steps to reproduce
open console panel to check log
### What is expected?
loading initial data for options should not trigger a DOM "change" event (as
it should be done by user)
### What is actually happening?
async data update will result with a DOM "change" event, while sync data
update will not.

this should has something to do with commit c70addf and it was working fine
with v2.4.1.
my app should fire a form submit after user changed option, but now the app
will submit right after data initialized. (check commented line in sample js)
