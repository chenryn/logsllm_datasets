better. (Libert et al. do not provide an implementation of their scheme.) As compared to their
scheme, ours has the advantage of not having to rely on trusted public parameters.
Recent work by Ling et al. [37] gives a group signature scheme based on lattices for which the
signature size is independent of the number of users in the group. However, they do not investigate
the concrete eﬃciency of their scheme, and it appears that our scheme will out-perform theirs for
practical settings of the parameters.
Some concurrent works [21, 12] have proposed constructions of ring and group signature schemes
based on ideas similar to ours, but using ZKB++ as the underlying NIZKPoK. As shown in Table 4,
by using our NIZKPoK in place of ZKB++ we are able to generate signatures roughly 3.5–4.4×
shorter than in their work. (They do not provide implementations, so we are unable to determine
the running times for their schemes.)

5 Conclusion
We show here a new construction of a “post-quantum” NIZKPoK with shorter proof size than in
prior work. We also explored applications of our work in the context of various signature schemes.
It remains interesting to explore other applications of our work, e.g., to smart contracts and/or
veriﬁcation of arithmetic circuits.

A Proof of Security for the Signature Scheme
In this section, we give a dedicated proof of security for the signature scheme constructed using
our ideas. In doing so, our goals are both to give a complete proof (taking into account certain
