##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Feature Idea
##### COMPONENT NAME
apt_repository module
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
never worked…
##### SUMMARY
I'm my systems I have a lot of repositories with an arch-qualifier.  
e.g.:
    deb [arch=ppc64el] http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ sid main
    deb [arch=amd64,i386] http://dl.google.com/linux/talkplugin/deb/ stable main
apt_repository does not understand them and tries to re-add that repos,
actually duplicating them.
Moreover I'd like to be able to specify these option in ansible. Currently
available options are (from sources.list(5):
           ·   arch=arch1,arch2,...  can be used to specify for which architectures information should be downloaded. If this option is not set all architectures
               defined by the APT::Architectures option will be downloaded.
           ·   arch+=arch1,arch2,...  and arch-=arch1,arch2,...  which can be used to add/remove architectures from the set which will be downloaded.
           ·   trusted=yes can be set to indicate that packages from this source are always authenticated even if the Release file is not signed or the signature can't
               be checked. This disables parts of apt-secure(8) and should therefore only be used in a local and trusted context.  trusted=no is the opposite which
               handles even correctly authenticated sources as not authenticated.
these options are surrounded by square brackets, and can or cannot have
leading and trailing spaces between the options and the brackets.
