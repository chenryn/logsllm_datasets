ABSTRACT
There are several mechanisms by which users can gain in-
sight into where their packets have gone, but no mechanisms
allow users undeniable proof that their packets did not tra-
verse certain parts of the world while on their way to or
from another host. This paper introduces the problem of
ﬁnding “proofs of avoidance”: evidence that the paths taken
by a packet and its response avoided a user-speciﬁed set of
“forbidden” geographic regions. Proving that something did
not happen is often intractable, but we demonstrate a low-
overhead proof structure built around the idea of what we
call “alibis”: relays with particular timing constraints that,
when upheld, would make it impossible to traverse both the
relay and the forbidden regions.
We present Alibi Routing, a peer-to-peer overlay routing
system for ﬁnding alibis securely and efﬁciently. One of
the primary distinguishing characteristics of Alibi Routing
is that it does not require knowledge of—or modiﬁcations
to—the Internet’s routing hardware or policies. Rather, Al-
ibi Routing is able to derive its proofs of avoidance from
user-provided GPS coordinates and speed of light propaga-
tion delays. Using a PlanetLab deployment and larger-scale
simulations, we evaluate Alibi Routing to demonstrate that
many source-destination pairs can avoid countries of their
choosing with little latency inﬂation. We also identify when
Alibi Routing does not work: it has difﬁculty avoiding re-
gions that users are very close to (or, of course, inside of).

INTRODUCTION
Users have little control over where in the world their
packets travel en route to their destinations. Some mecha-
nisms exist to provide insight into where packets traveled,
such as the record-route IP option, overlay routing systems
(§7), or to a lesser extent source-routing. While these ap-
proaches expose a subset of the path the user’s packets took,
they do not allow a user to determine or provably inﬂuence
where their packets do not go.
This paper introduces a new primitive we call provable
avoidance routing. With provable avoidance routing, a user
speciﬁes arbitrary geographic regions—such as countries or
UN voting blocs—to be avoided while communicating with
a destination. If successful, the primitive returns proof that
the user’s packets did not traverse the forbidden regions. If it
is unsuccessful, it concludes only that the packets may have
traversed them.
The goal of provable avoidance routing is detection, as
opposed to prevention. In other words, alone, it is unable
to ensure a user’s packets will not traverse a region of the
world—we do not require modiﬁcations to the underlying
routing protocols or hardware, and so we are subject to all of
today’s uncertainties as to where packets will travel. Rather,
what we are able to provide is assurance that the user’s pack-
ets and their respective responses took paths that did not
traverse regions of the world. Our proofs of avoidance are
provided on a per-packet basis, and are a posteriori: only
after sending the packet and getting a reply can we ascer-
tain whether or not the round-trip communication avoided
the forbidden region.
While outright prevention would be ideal, detection can
be a powerful tool, as well. For example, consider one of the
greatest threats to open communication on the Internet: cen-
sorship. Beyond just dropping [34] or logging [29] users’
trafﬁc, censorship can take many forms, including injecting
packets with false information [4]. Recent results indicate
that many users may be censored not by their (or their desti-
nation’s) countries, but by regimes through which their pack-
ets transit; a group of anonymous researchers demonstrated
that DNS queries that merely traverse China’s borders are
611subject to the same injection of false responses as if the
queries came from one of its own citizens [4]. Incomplete
deployment of authenticated protocols such as DNSSEC re-
quires users to take other approaches, typically consisting of
hiding packets’ contents via encryption [10, 8], forwarding
through hidden proxies [18, 46, 17], or applying steganog-
raphy [11]. We offer an orthogonal approach: rather than
use-and-confuse a censoring regime, we show that it is pos-
sible to simply avoid the censor altogether.
As another example of the usefulness of provable avoid-
ance routing, two parties could perform Difﬁe-Hellman key
exchange and use the proofs of avoidance to ensure that there
could not have been a man-in-the-middle from user-speciﬁed
forbidden regions. Subsequent communication after the ini-
tial key exchange would thus provide conﬁdentiality even if
the default route traversed the forbidden regions.
This paper makes two main technical contributions. The
ﬁrst is a means of proving that a packet avoided a forbid-
den region (§3). Our proofs of avoidance are built around
the idea of using what we call “alibis”: relays that are sufﬁ-
ciently far away from the forbidden region such that travers-
ing both relay and forbidden region would result in a notice-
ably high delay.
The second contribution we make is the design and imple-
mentation of Alibi Routing, a peer-to-peer overlay routing
system for ﬁnding alibis safely and efﬁciently (§4). Alibi
Routing is secure in that, when tasked with ﬁnding alibis for
a forbidden region F , it too avoids F (§5).
It is efﬁcient
in that it requires a small amount of state, and takes few
hops, especially when the source and destination are both
reasonably far from the regions they seek to avoid. Most im-
portantly, Alibi Routing is immediately and incrementally
deployable:
it requires no public key infrastructure (PKI)
or modiﬁcations to existing routing protocols or switching
hardware; it does not require synchronized clocks; and it
does not require access to any information about the under-
lying routing topology of the Internet. Rather, it derives its
security and proofs of avoidance from “a clock and a map”:
local measurements of round-trip times and a rough knowl-
edge of one’s own (and one’s attacker’s) GPS coordinates.
Using an implementation and deployment on PlanetLab
(as well as large-scale simulations), we show that many source-
destination pairs can avoid countries of their choosing with
reasonably low latency inﬂation (§6). We also identify the
instances when Alibi Routing does not work: in general, the
closer a source or its destination is to a forbidden region F ,
the fewer potential alibis there are.
Alibi Routing is not a panacea; for instance, it is impos-
sible for users to avoid the countries they are in—the very
problem traditional censorship-resistant systems address. Our
goal is not to replace such systems, but to complement them;
as we will show, Alibi Routing offers an orthogonal set of
properties that combine well with prior systems (§7).
2. GOALS AND NON-GOALS
In this section, we describe the goals (and non-goals) of
a provable route avoidance primitive. Suppose that source s
has sent a query to d and received a response, and s wishes
to verify neither query nor response traversed some region
of the world F . Our ultimate goal is to be able to construct
a proof that s can check to make sure that the packet and its
response could not have possibly traversed F .
Ideally, this primitive should be easy to deploy and use.
To this end, we avoid modiﬁcations to existing routing pro-
tocols like BGP [50], or to hardware in the Internet [2, 28].
Rather, we show that users themselves can provide this ser-
vice with an overlay protocol.
Provable route avoidance does not seek to provide two
otherwise desirable properties. First, it does not seek to guar-
antee that an adversary would never see a copy of the packet.
Even if the user is able to prove that the adversary was not
on the packet’s path, it does not stop nodes on the path from
copying and later delivering the packets to the adversary. Ex-
isting approaches to anonymity (§7) can complement alibi
routing to make copies less useful to a censor.
Second, alibi routing seeks to allow users to prove that a
packet must have avoided F after the fact, not to guaran-
tee that a packet will not traverse F . Higher-layer protocols
must choose how to react to the absence of a proof, that is,
the observation that the communication may have traversed
F . Some may require that all packets avoid a part of the net-
work: such applications should treat packets that might have
traversed F as failures and retransmit. Other higher-layer
protocols may permit some fraction of packets through F ,
for instance if they are using alibi routing for non-adversarial
reasons, e.g., for performance or path diversity.
3. PROOFS OF AVOIDANCE
Here, we demonstrate how to prove that a packet and its
response did not traverse a region of the world. In general,
proving that some event x did not happen is very difﬁcult.
Our proof structure seeks to demonstrate that x did not hap-
pen because it would have been impossible. It consists of
ﬁnding a set of events A such that:
• It can be proved that events in A did happen.
• A and x are mutually exclusive.
If these properties both hold, then x could not have hap-
pened: the events A serve as an alibi for x.
3.1 Mutually exclusive routing events
What then are the mutually exclusive events that would
lead to provable route avoidance? In this setting, the event
x that we wish to prove impossible is the event that a packet
and its response from s to d transited forbidden region F .
We need two pieces of evidence from A.
First, we must know a subset of the path that the packet
took. To this end, a user forwards packets through a relay
node r. r signs1 the packet, and thus, if r can be trusted
not to have shared his key, then this proves that the packet
1In fact, because we do not make use of digital signature’s
property of non-repudiation, a symmetric key MAC sufﬁces.
612We call relays that yield such proof alibis. Note that, to
be an alibi, it is necessary for a relay to be far from the
forbidden region:
if very close, then for any x there may
be an f such that R(r, x) is not noticeably different than
R(r, f ) + R(f, x). However, simply being far away is not
sufﬁcient for a relay to be an alibi: if F were on the path
from s to r, then no matter how far r is from F , Eq. (1) will
not hold. As a result, locating alibis is non-trivial; in the next
section, we describe one way to do it.
3.2 Practical considerations
How to obtain proof. Equation (1) asserts that no node
f in the forbidden region could unnoticeably appear on the
path. It would be unrealistic to identify and enumerate all
actual hosts in a forbidden region—particularly when it is
adversarial. We demonstrate in Section 4 how to use geo-
graphic distance to estimate the lowest possible round-trip
time between two hosts.
When to obtain proof. Our proofs of avoidance are based
on local measurements of round-trip times for packets. La-
tencies can vary over time—e.g., due to outages, route changes,
or congestion [30]—and thus a relay that is a viable alibi at
one point in time may not be one later, potentially even on a
per-packet basis. As a result, our proofs of avoidance must
be applied to each packet.
The factor of δ in the above equations helps insulate prov-
able avoidance from latency ﬂuctuations. δ represents a trade-
off between safety and efﬁciency; larger values of δ yield
alibis who are so far away from a forbidden region that, if
packets were to traverse both, there would be a very large in-
crease in latency over a normal path through the alibi. Thus,
with a large δ, one may be less likely to ﬁnd a viable alibi,
but that alibi is likely to work even in the face of variable
round-trip times and congestion. Section 6 shows that we
are successful in ﬁnding alibis for a range of δ values.
4. ALIBI ROUTING PROTOCOL
In this section, we describe Alibi Routing, a peer-to-peer
overlay routing protocol for locating alibis. Once found,
users forward their trafﬁc through alibis, and apply the tech-
niques from Section 3 to obtain proofs of avoidance. Alibi
Routing is secure in that no routing messages are accepted
unless they provably did not traverse the forbidden region
the source node speciﬁed; we analyze its security properties
in Section 5. Alibi Routing is efﬁcient in that it ﬁnds relays
quickly, without having to contact many intermediate hops;
we evaluate its performance in Section 6.
4.1 Trust assumptions and attack model
Users query Alibi Routing by specifying (1) a destina-
tion with whom they wish to communicate, and (2) a geo-
graphic forbidden region F through which they want proof
their packets do not traverse. For any peer who cannot be
proved to be outside a user’s speciﬁed forbidden region, we
assume that it will act in a Byzantine faulty manner toward
that user. The central assumption underlying Alibi Routing

traversing geographic region F . Relay r can serve as an
alibi if packets that would traverse any possible node f in F
would induce noticeably higher RTTs, as captured in Eq. (1).
must have gone through r (we deﬁne our trust assumptions
in Section 4).
Second, we must know that, for any possible path that
includes s, r, and d, the packets could not have also gone
through F . Of course, there are many ways the packet can
traverse F : r could ignore the users’ wishes and forward the
packet through F , or F could lie on the path between s and
r or r to d. In other words, proving a subset of the path a
packet took is feasible, but how can we prove that no node
from F was anywhere on the path?
The key idea is to choose a relay that is so distant from
the forbidden region that transiting both would induce no-
ticeably high delays. Figure 1 illustrates the idea. When s
routes through r to get to d, it observes the round-trip times
between itself and the relay, R(s, r), and the relay and the
