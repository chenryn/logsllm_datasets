## Abstract
Most research on traffic matrices (TMs) has focused on finding models that aid in inference, but not on other critical tasks such as synthesis, prediction, or anomaly detection. This paper proposes a general model for TMs that is sparse, meaning it has a small number of parameters relative to the size of the TM. A Multi-Resolution Analysis (MRA) using Diffusion Wavelets (DW) provides a sparse representation and adapts to the network's structure. We describe the construction of a two-dimensional DW transform and demonstrate its application to TMs. Results from operational networks confirm the sparseness and applicability of this approach to various TM-related tasks.

## 1. Introduction
Traffic matrices (TMs) provide essential data on traffic volumes between ingress and egress nodes in a network, and have been a subject of significant interest [1]. TMs are fundamental for many network engineering tasks but are challenging to measure directly. Much work has gone into either measuring TMs [8] or inferring them indirectly from link load measurements [2, 14, 19, 20, 21], leading to practical outcomes [17].

While inference models are useful due to their reliance on easily obtained measurements, they often lack sufficient information to form a well-posed problem, necessitating side information, typically in the form of a TM model. However, modeling TMs is not just about inference. Other tasks, such as TM synthesis [9, 15], require precise control over generated samples for performance analysis of new traffic engineering algorithms. Accurate representation of real-world TM properties in synthetic TMs is crucial to avoid incorrect results. The lack of publicly available traffic data from commercial ISPs exacerbates this challenge.

Network engineering also benefits from TM models, such as in the design of new or re-designed networks [7]. Predicting future TMs and detecting anomalies by identifying deviations from predicted behavior are additional important applications. Most TM research has focused on inference, neglecting these other tasks. Finding a "good" TM model is problem-dependent and remains an open issue.

In this paper, we propose that a good TM model should be sparse, having a small number of parameters compared to the size of the TM. For a network with \( N \) nodes, a TM has \( N^2 \) terms, making a sparse model with \( M \ll N^2 \) parameters highly desirable. Sparse models offer several advantages:
- They balance model fidelity and predictive power.
- Fewer parameters allow for better physical interpretation and engineering insight.
- They can make the inference problem well-posed when the number of link-load measurements is limited.

Multi-Resolution Analysis (MRA) using Diffusion Wavelets (DW) is our proposed tool for constructing a sparse TM model. DW-based MRA techniques decorrelate long-range dependencies, are computationally efficient, and preserve perceptible features in few coefficients. Unlike standard wavelet-based MRA, DWs are suitable for TMs because they account for the complex spatial relationships in the underlying network. Our main contribution is the generalization of DWs to 2D and their application to TM modeling. We find that TMs are sparse and stable in the DW domain, with instability indicating potential anomalies. Our results, based on real operational network data, serve as a proof of concept for the viability of sparse TM models in inference, synthesis, and prediction.

## 2. Background and Related Work
An IP network can be modeled as a graph, with nodes representing routers or Points-of-Presence (PoPs) and edges representing links. A TM describes the traffic volumes from ingress to egress points over a time period, useful for capacity planning, traffic engineering, and reliability analysis. Direct measurement of TMs using flow-level traffic collection is challenging, while SNMP data, which is easier to collect, only provides link load measurements. The relationship between link measurements \( y \) and the TM \( x \) is given by \( y = Ax \), where \( A \) is the routing matrix [19]. Inferring the TM from link measurements is an underconstrained, linear-inverse problem requiring side information.

Various models have been used for TM inference, including Poisson [19], Gaussian [2], logit-choice [14], and gravity [20] models. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) has been used to exploit correlations between TM elements for anomaly detection [10, 11, 16]. However, these approaches do not provide simple models for synthesis. Our work aims to fill this gap by providing a sparse, interpretable, and versatile TM model.
