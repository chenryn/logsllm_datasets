User: Suppose you need to create a cloud storage service that supports functions such as file upload, download, sharing, and permission management. Please provide an architectural design and technical implementation plan for this cloud storage.
Assistant: Architecture design: 1. Front-end implementation: use the React framework to build the front-end page, use Antd for UI design, and implement functions such as file upload, download, sharing, and permission management in the page; 2. Back-end implementation: use the Java development framework Spring Boot, Provide RESTful API to realize the business logic of file storage, sharing and permission management, and connect to the database for data storage and management; 3. Storage implementation: use object storage services provided by cloud service providers, such as AWS S3, Alibaba Cloud OSS, etc. Store files uploaded by users; 4. Identity authentication implementation: use OAuth 2.0 protocol for identity authentication, support user registration, login and other functions; 5. Notification function implementation: use message queue technology, such as Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc., to realize file sharing and Notification function for permission management. Technical implementation plan: 1. Front-end technology stack: React, Antd, Axios, Webpack, etc.; 2. Back-end technology stack: Java, Spring Boot, MyBatis, MySQL, etc.; 3. Storage technology stack: object storage provided by cloud service providers, Such as AWS S3, Alibaba Cloud OSS, etc.; 4. Identity authentication technology stack: OAuth 2.0 protocol, Spring Security, etc.; 5. Notification technology stack: Apache Kafka, Spring Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc. Implementation steps: 1. Build a front-end framework to realize functions such as file upload, download, sharing and authority management; 2. Design a database to store user information, file information, authority information, etc.; 3. Use the Spring Boot framework to build a backend to achieve RESTful API, realize the business logic of file storage, sharing and rights management, and connect to the MySQL database; 4. Use the object storage provided by the cloud service provider to store the files uploaded by the user; 5. Use the OAuth2.0 protocol to implement user identity authentication, and add Spring Security 6. Use message queue technology to realize the notification function of file sharing and rights management; 7. Carry out automated testing, performance testing, security inspection, etc. to ensure system quality; 8. Deploy to the cloud server and run online, Perform operation and maintenance management.
