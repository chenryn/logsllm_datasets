### Title: How to Build Synthetic Persons in Cyberspace

One of the greatest challenges in developing effective cyberspace operators is creating realistic training environments. While many organizations have developed technologies and techniques for replicating enterprise-scale networks, a significant hurdle remains: how to realistically populate these networks with synthetic persons. Whether training network defenders or penetration testers, it is essential to pit them against adaptive and intelligent adversaries who can continuously challenge their skills. Additionally, these training environments need to be rich ecosystems where realistic user agents exchange messages, interact with the web, and occasionally assist or hinder the efforts of both attackers and defenders.

In this talk, we will discuss our research and development of a family of Cyberspace Cognitive (CyCog) agents designed to behave like attackers, defenders, or users in a network. The attacker agent (CyCog-A) was developed to train defenders, while its defensive counterpart (CyCog-D) was intended to help develop penetration testers. The user agent (CyCog-U) is more versatile, as it can support both types of training. These synthetic users, modeled after actual network users, can display behaviors that either hinder or assist attackers and defenders.

Our experiences and successes highlight both current gaps and future opportunities. From the need for scalable cyberspace mapping techniques to our work in modeling behaviors, and the lessons learned in human-machine teaming, the CyCog family of agents is opening new dimensions in cyberspace operations research and development.
