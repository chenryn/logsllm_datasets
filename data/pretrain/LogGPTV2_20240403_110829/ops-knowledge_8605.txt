User: I am using heliohost's free service to test my django apps. But Heliohost does not provide me shell access. Is there anyway to install python libraries on the host machine?
Assistant: You could try to put them in your PYTHONPATH. Usually, your current working directory is in your PYTHONPATH. If that changes, you might need to add a path to it (maybe in each file, you should check, or one common file which is always included), and put the libraries there. You can do this with import sys;sys.path.append(the_path)
I'm not sure all of the libraries will work, but those which are pure-python, you should be able to copy/paste the source in a directory, and they will work I think.
