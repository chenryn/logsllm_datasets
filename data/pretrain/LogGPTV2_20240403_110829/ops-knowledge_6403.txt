User: How to setup SSH connection in linux system for better security?
Assistant: You can set up SSH connection through the following steps to achieve better security: 1. Configure SSH service: Make sure that the SSH service is installed and running normally. 2. Disable root user SSH login: Set "PermitRootLogin no" in the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to disable root user login through SSH. 3. Install a firewall: Use firewall tools such as iptables or ufw to filter the SSH port. 4. Use SSH public key authentication: Use SSH public key authentication to verify user identity. First create an SSH key pair, then add the public key to the target host's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file. 5. Configure SSH port: Change the default port of SSH connection to reduce the risk of brute force cracking. 6. Monitor SSH logs: Monitor the /var/log/auth.log file and other SSH-related log files to detect abnormal login behaviors in time and respond accordingly. The above are some basic SSH security setting measures, and there are other more complex security measures that need to be configured according to specific situations.
