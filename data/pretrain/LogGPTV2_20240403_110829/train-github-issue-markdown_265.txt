## Expected Behavior
I should be able to run a nextjs app on multiple server replicas without
errors occurring.
## Current Behavior
Trying to run next 4.1.4 in a kubernetes cluster and about half of the
requests to the server result in "An unexpected error has occurred." If the
request is made client-side, the only error in the console is `500 - Internal
Server Error. undefined`. There is no server log with more error details.
This does not appear to be happening with a 3.x app run in a similar context.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Create next.js 4 app
  2. Run in kubernetes cluster
  3. Load page repeatedly
## Context
I've already implemented the build-stats hack here #2978 (comment) to have
consistent build ids across the replicas. That resolved that set of errors but
now stuck with undebuggable errors.
ETA: This appears to still be build id related. The error that's thrown has
`buildIdMismatched: true` even through both replicas have identical
`.next/build-stats.json` files.
