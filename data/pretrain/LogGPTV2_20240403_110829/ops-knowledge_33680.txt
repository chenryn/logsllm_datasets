User: Please describe common database design patterns and optimization techniques, and explain when they are used.
Assistant: 1. Relational database design pattern Relational database design pattern is one of the most common database design patterns. It uses data tables to describe the relationship between data and to ensure data integrity and consistency. This database design pattern is best suited for systems that require extensive update operations or require advanced queries. 2. NoSQL database design pattern NoSQL database design pattern is an option to use non-relational database for storage. Common NoSQL database design patterns include document databases, graph databases, and key-value databases. This database design pattern is best for systems that require a lot of scalability and scalability. 3. Materialized view Materialized view is a technique used to improve query performance. It materializes the results of the original data into a table, and can save a certain amount of time when querying the table. This optimization technique is best suited for systems that require a large number of complex queries. 4. Indexing Indexing is a key technique used to improve query performance. It extracts the value of a specific column of a table to allow faster queries and sorting. Indexes are best suited for systems that need to query specific columns or order certain columns. 5. Partition Partition refers to dividing a table into multiple logical parts to improve query performance and management efficiency. Partitions can be partitioned based on specific columns in a table, allowing faster queries. Partitions are best suited for systems that need to query large tables or perform complex calculations. 6. Sorting Sorting is a technique used to improve query performance. It allows data to be arranged in a specific order, thereby speeding up queries. Sorting is best suited for systems that need to query or order results based on specific columns. 7. Data caching Data caching is a technique of storing data in memory to allow faster access. It can greatly reduce the time of query and read operations. Data caching is best suited for systems that require frequent queries.
