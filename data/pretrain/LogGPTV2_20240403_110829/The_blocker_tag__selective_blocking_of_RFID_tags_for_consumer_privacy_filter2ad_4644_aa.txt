## Abstract
We propose the use of "selective blocking" by "blocker tags" as a method to protect consumers from unwanted scanning of RFID (Radio-Frequency IDentification) tags attached to items they may be carrying or wearing. While an ordinary RFID tag is a simple, inexpensive (e.g., five-cent) passive device used as an "electronic bar-code" in supply-chain management, a blocker tag is a low-cost passive RFID device that can simulate multiple ordinary RFID tags simultaneously. When carried by a consumer, a blocker tag can "block" RFID readers either universally by simulating all possible RFID tags or selectively by simulating only specific subsets of ID codes, such as those from a particular manufacturer or within a designated "privacy zone."

We believe this approach, when used with appropriate caution, provides an attractive alternative for addressing privacy concerns raised by the potential widespread use of RFID tags in consumer products. We also discuss potential abuses arising from blocker tags and methods for detecting and mitigating them.

## 1. Introduction
An RFID tag consists of a small integrated circuit attached to a small antenna, capable of transmitting a unique serial number over several meters to a reading device in response to a query. Most RFID tags are passive, meaning they are batteryless and obtain the power necessary to operate from the query signal itself.

RFID tags are already common, with applications including proximity cards, theft-detection tags, and automated toll payment devices. The cost of simple RFID tags is expected to fall to approximately $0.05 per unit in the next few years, while tags as small as 0.4mm Ã— 0.4mm and thin enough to be embedded in paper are already commercially available. These advancements in cost and size will ensure a rapid proliferation of RFID tags into many new areas of use.

### 1.1 The Threat to Privacy
The impending ubiquity of RFID tags poses a significant threat to consumer privacy. Each RFID tag broadcasts a unique serial number, which can include detailed information about the product and its owner. This raises concerns about the public readability of sensitive information, such as dress sizes, medications, and financial details. Recent negative media coverage has led some retailers, like Benetton, to withdraw plans for embedding RFID tags in their products.

### 1.2 The "Kill Tag" Approach
One straightforward approach to protecting consumer privacy is to "kill" RFID tags before they reach consumers. A killed tag is permanently deactivated. The AutoID Center proposes that tags be killed upon purchase, using a special "kill" command. However, this approach is inadequate for many applications where tags need to remain active, such as in home appliances and innovative consumer-specific applications.

### 1.3 The Faraday Cage Approach
Another method is to shield RFID tags using a Faraday cage, a container made of metal mesh or foil that blocks radio signals. While effective for small items, this approach is impractical for a wide range of objects, such as clothing and wearable devices.

### 1.4 The Active Jamming Approach
Active jamming involves broadcasting radio signals to block or disrupt nearby RFID readers. This method, however, can be illegal and may cause severe disruption to legitimate RFID systems. Our proposed approach is more subtle, interacting cleverly with the RFID singulation protocol to disrupt only certain operations.

### 1.5 The "Smart" RFID Tag Approach
A more sophisticated approach is to make RFID tags "smarter" using cryptographic methods. This includes the hash-lock method, the re-encryption approach, and silent tree-walking. These methods, while effective, are challenging to design due to the severe cost constraints on RFID tags.

#### 1.5.1 The Hash-Lock Approach
In this method, a tag is locked and can only be unlocked with a specific key or PIN. This approach requires careful management of lock/unlock patterns and associated PINs, which can be inconvenient for consumers.

#### 1.5.2 The Re-Encryption Approach
This approach involves encrypting tag serial numbers with a public key and periodically re-encrypting them to reduce linkability. While effective, it requires an extensive infrastructure of re-encryption agents, making it resource-intensive.

#### 1.5.3 Silent Tree-Walking
This method addresses the threat posed by passive eavesdroppers by focusing on the signals broadcast by the reader rather than the tag. It is an extension of the standard tree-walking singulation protocol but suffers from similar drawbacks as the re-encryption approach.

## Conclusion
The blocker tag approach offers a flexible and practical solution to the privacy concerns associated with RFID tags. By allowing selective blocking, it provides a balance between functionality and privacy, making it a promising alternative for future RFID applications.
