ABSTRACT
We propose the use of “selective blocking” by “blocker tags”
as a way of protecting consumers from unwanted scanning
of RFID tags attached to items they may be carrying or
wearing.
While an ordinary RFID tag is a simple, cheap (e.g. ﬁve-
cent) passive device intended as an “electronic bar-code” for
use in supply-chain management, a blocker tag is a cheap
passive RFID device that can simulate many ordinary RFID
tags simultaneously. When carried by a consumer, a blocker
tag thus “blocks” RFID readers. It can do so universally by
simulating all possible RFID tags. Or a blocker tag can
block selectively by simulating only selected subsets of ID
codes, such as those by a particular manufacturer, or those
in a designated “privacy zone.”
We believe that this approach, when used with appro-
priate care, provides a very attractive alternative for ad-
dressing privacy concerns raised by the potential (and likely)
widespread use of RFID tags in consumer products.
We also discuss possible abuses arising from blocker tags,
and means for detecting and dealing with them.

INTRODUCTION
An RFID (Radio-Frequency IDentiﬁcation) tag consists
of a small integrated circuit attached to a small antennae,
capable of transmitting a unique serial number a distance
of several meters to a reading device in response to a query.
Most RFID tags are passive: they are batteryless and obtain
the power necessary to operate from the query signal itself.

RFID tags are already quite common; examples include
proximity cards used as replacements for metal door keys,
theft-detection tags attached to consumer goods such as
clothing, and the small dashboard devices for automating
toll payments.
The cost of simple RFID tags is likely to fall to roughly
$0.05/unit in the next several years [15], while tags as small
as 0.4mm × 0.4mm, and thin enough to be embedded in pa-
per are already commercially available [17]. Such improve-
ments in cost and size will ensure a rapid proliferation of
RFID tags into many new areas of use.
Indeed, the European Central Bank (ECB) has already
indicated its plans to embed RFID tags in high-value Euro
notes by 2005 [3, 20], while Gillette has recently ordered half
a billion tags for use in retail environments [4].
The MIT AutoID Center (www.autoidcenter.org) leads
an industry consortium whose goals include designing ex-
ceptionally cheap RFID tags for use in supply-chain man-
agement, designing standardized protocols for querying and
managing RFID tags, and exploring methods for dealing
with the privacy concerns raised by the prospective perva-
sive use of RFID tags. (While the research we present here
was not sponsored by the AutoID consortium, we believe it
is very much consonant with the goals of the consortium.)
The AutoID Center envisions that RFID tags will play a
major role as a means for implementing “electronic product
codes” (EPC) in a standardized manner, for supply-chain
and inventory management [2].
RFID tags will replace and improve upon the traditional
ubiquitous printed barcode in consumer products. This
change promises more ﬂexible and intelligent handling of
consumer goods and devices.
In addition to the mundane (but very important) impli-
cations for supply-chain management and automated check-
out, RFID tags oﬀer interesting new possibilities, such as
microwave ovens that can read the tags on packages and
cook food without explicit instructions, refrigerators that
can recognize expired foodstuﬀs, and closets that can tally
their contents.
1.1 The Threat to Privacy
The impending ubiquity of RFID tags, however, also poses
a potentially widespread threat to consumer privacy [8].
The simplest RFID tag will broadcast its ID serial number
– that is, its electronic product code (EPC) – to any nearby
reader.
The ID number, as envisioned by the AutoID Center, is
unique to a given tag. It contains not only the traditional
information contained in a printed barcode (indicating man-
103ufacturer and product type), but also a unique serial number
for that tag. Each consumer product or item of clothing will
be uniquely identiﬁed. The ID number will be 64–128 bits
in length.
This presents a clear potential for privacy violations.
What woman wants her dress size to be publicly readable
by any nearby scanner? Who wants the medications and
other contents of a purse to be scannable? Who wants the
amount of money in a wallet to be easily determinable by a
scanner? Who wants his or her location to be tracked and
recorded based on the unique ID number in shoes or other
clothing?
The privacy issues raised by RFID tags have seen re-
cent attention in the popular press, whose negative coverage
forced the clothing retailer Benetton to withdraw plans for
embedding RFID tags in its items of apparel [1, 16].
Researchers have recognized the RFID privacy problem
for some time [7, 12], and are devising better approaches.
No single approach is likely to be completely satisfactory,
however; a combination of methods may prove to be best.
This paper introduces a new, powerful tool into the arsenal
of privacy-protecting technologies related to RFID tags.
In the next few subsections we ﬁrst discuss some previ-
ously suggested approaches for protecting consumer privacy
threatened by RFID tags. We then move on to our “blocker-
tag” approach.
1.2 The “Kill Tag” approach
The most straightforward approach for the protection of
consumer privacy is to “kill” RFID tags before they are
placed in the hands of consumers. A killed tag is truly dead,
and can never be re-activated.
The standard mode of operation proposed by the AutoID
Center is indeed for tags to be killed upon purchase of the
tagged product. With their proposed tag design, a tag can
be killed by sending it a special “kill” command (including
a short 8-bit “password”) [12, 13].
For example, a supermarket might use RFID tags to facil-
itate inventory management and monitoring of shelf stocks.
To protect consumer privacy, checkout clerks would “kill”
the tags of purchased goods; no purchased goods would con-
tain active RFID tags.
1.2.1 Why the “Kill” approach is inadequate.
There are many environments, however, in which simple
measures like “kill” commands are unworkable or undesir-
able for privacy enforcement.
For example, consumers may wish RFID tags to remain
operative while in their possession. The examples of home
use set forth in [12, 14] – e.g., microwave oven that reads
cooking instructions from food packages – rely on actively
operational tags.
Similarly, new and clever consumer-speciﬁc applications
for RFID-tags are already beginning to emerge. For exam-
ple, a Prada store in New York City tracks the RFID tags
of items held by customers in order to display related acces-
sories on nearby screens [11].
Other examples of RFID-tag applications for ordinary
consumers include eﬀortless physical access control1, theft-
protection of belongings, and wireless cash cards.
1Smartcards with RFID-enabled chips are in fact in use for
this purpose today, but generally only function in very close
proximity to readers.
A low-cost powerful technology like RFID tags will in-
evitably be used in numerous applications, many of which
we don’t even imagine today. Many of these applications
will require that tags still be active while in the consumer’s
possession, and thus cannot be killed upon purchase. Here
are a few suggestive such applications:
• Stores may wish products to have tags scannable if the
products are returned as defective.
• Products may need to be scanned so they may be cat-
egorized for recycling purposes.
• Stores may issue receipts with embedded RFID tags,
so they can conﬁrm purchase details when a product
is returned.
• Individuals may wish to have RFID tags embedded in
their business cards, to facilitate scanning by recipi-
ents. Here the tag ID may be used to create a URL
referring to the actual card data.
• A store may wish to embed RFID tags in store-issued
coupons, for ease of scanning at the checkout counter.
• A user may wish to scan his possessions when a recall
for a speciﬁc set of products is issued.
• Collectibles such as baseball cards or CDs may have
RFID tags, to enable owners to manage their inventory
better.
• A merchant may wish to scan consumers for marketing
purposes. (For example, what stores has this shopper
previously visited today? What items has he bought
previously from a competitor?)
• A refrigerator or pantry shelf may be able to tell when
some food or drug product has passed its expiration
(“use by”) date.
• The US Postal Service may include RFID tags in
postage stamps.
• An airline ticket may contain an embedded RFID tag
to allow simpler tracking of passengers within an air-
port.
• Businesses may include RFID tags on the invoices,
coupons, and return envelopes they mail to consumers,
for ease of sorting upon return.
Such “function creep” promises to result in many more
uses unimagined or unimaginable today in which active tags
will be valuable to consumers or businesses.
As an additional example, it may be possible for con-
sumers to buy little “stickies” with embedded RFID tags,
to attach to objects of their choice for idiosyncratic pur-
poses. (Maybe for a “treasure hunt”, for assisting a blind
person, or for baggage labeling.)
Individuals may also be secretly given tags so they can
be tracked or identiﬁed by an overzealous merchant, by a
private detective, by a spouse, parent, or other relative.
Thus, while the “kill-tag on purchase” approach may han-
dle many or even most instances of potential concern for
privacy, it is unlikely to be a fully satisfactory solution.
Therefore, it seems imperative to explore alternative ap-
proaches.
1.3 The Faraday Cage approach
An RFID tag may be shielded from scrutiny using what
is known as a Faraday Cage—a container made of metal
mesh or foil that is impenetrable by radio signals (of certain
frequencies).
Indeed, petty thieves are already known to
use foil-lined bags in retail shops to circumvent shoplifting-
detection mechanisms.
If high-value currency notes do indeed come supplied with
active RFID tags, then it is likely that foil-lined wallets will
become big sellers! At least one company already oﬀers a
Faraday-cage-based product for privacy purposes [9].
RFID tags will inevitably see use, however, in a vast range
of objects that cannot be placed conveniently in containers,
such as clothing [1, 16], wrist-watches, and even human be-
ings [5, 8].
Faraday cages thus represent at best a very partial solu-
tion to consumer privacy.
1.4 The Active Jamming Approach
Active jamming of RF signals is another, related physical
means of shielding tags from view. The consumer could
carry a device that actively broadcasts radio signals so as
to block and/or disrupt the operation of any nearby RFID
readers.
This approach may be illegal – at least if the broadcast
power is too high – and is a crude, sledgehammer approach.
It could cause severe disruption of all nearby RFID systems,
even those in legitimate applications where privacy is not a
concern.
The approach we propose in this paper is akin to “jam-
ming,” but is much more subtle in its operation, interacting
cleverly with the RFID “singulation” protocol to disrupt
only certain operations.
1.5 The “Smart” RFID Tag Approach
Another general approach is to make the RFID tags a
bit “smarter,” so that they interact in a way that protects
privacy better, while providing the desired active function-
ality. This would typically involve the use of cryptographic
methods.
These approaches are exceptionally challenging to design,
given the severe cost constraints on the basic RFID tag.
(With a budget of ﬁve cents, there is very little to spend on
additional logic gates!)
Three instances of the “smart RFID-tag” approach that
re-
have been proposed are the hash-lock method, the
encryption method, and silent tree-walking.
1.5.1 The “Hash-Lock” Approach.
In this approach, due to Weis et al. [18, 19], a tag may
be “locked” so that it refuses to reveal its ID until it is
“unlocked.”
In the simplest scenario, when the tag is locked it is given a
value (or meta-ID) y, and it is only unlocked by presentation
of a key or PIN value x such that y = h(x) for a standard
one-way hash function h.
In the supermarket example, tags may be locked at check-
out time. A consumer could provide a meta-ID y for the tags
(perhaps on a loyalty card), and then transmit the unlocking
PIN x via some special device (perhaps requiring physical
contact) to unlock tags on returning home.
To make this approach workable, it may be necessary for a
reader to query a tag to ﬁnd its meta-ID, so that the reader
knows which PIN to use to unlock it. But this may allow
tracking of tags via their meta-IDs, defeating their whole
purpose. Weis et al. show how to use randomization in the
hash function computation to solve this problem.
While this is an eﬀective approach, it seems likely that
consumers will ﬁnd it inconvenient to manage the lock /
unlock patterns and associated PINs of more than a small
collection of tags. In addition, it is possible that consumers
may not even be aware of which objects in their possession
carry RFID tags.
1.5.2 The re-encryption approach.
Juels and Pappu [7] address the privacy implications of
RFID-tags embedded in banknotes, with a scheme where
banknote tag serial numbers are encrypted with a law-
enforcement public key. The resulting ciphertexts undergo
periodic re-encryption to reduce the linkability of diﬀerent
appearances of a given tag.
Because of the severely restricted computing resources of
RFID tags, they propose that re-encryption be performed by
external computing agents, e.g., publicly provided privacy-
enhancing stations in stores. The correct behavior of such
re-encryption agents may be veriﬁed when banknotes are
handled in stores and banks.
The main drawback to this approach is its resource-
in-
tensive nature. While RFID tags in their scheme do not
perform cryptographic operation and would not be unreal-
istically costly, the required infrastructure of re-encryption
agents and optical veriﬁers would probably be burdensome.
Golle et al. [6] describe a similar scheme that is more
suitable for privacy-protection of RFID tags embedded in
consumer goods. They use multiple public keys, thanks to a
technique they call “universal re-encryption.” This is an ex-
tension of the El Gamal cryptosystem in which it is possible
to re-encrypt a ciphertext without knowing the associated
public key.
The Golle et al. scheme suﬀers from the same drawback
as that of Juels and Pappu, namely the requirement for an
infrastructure of re-encryption devices.
1.5.3 Silent Tree-Walking.
Weis et al. [18] correctly note that the threat posed by
passive eavesdroppers is more their ability to hear the sig-
nals broadcast by the tag reader, which may be picked up
many hundreds of meters away, than their ability to hear
the signals of an RFID tag, which can only be picked up
nearby.
This is unfortunate, since the IDs read by the standard
tree-walking singulation protocol can be inferred by hearing
merely the signals broadcast by the reader.
