User: How to implement SQL optimization and improve database performance?
Assistant: 1. Write optimized SQL statements: Use correct query methods, reduce subqueries, use indexes, etc. to write optimized SQL statements. 2. Use indexes: Indexes are an important means to improve query performance. Indexes need to be designed and created based on business and query requirements. 3. Regularly clean up the database: Regularly clean up useless data and delete unnecessary indexes to shorten query time and occupy space. 4. Optimize the table structure: reasonably design the table structure to avoid data redundancy and improve data access efficiency. 5. Adjust hardware configuration: configure higher CPU, larger memory, faster disk and other hardware devices. 6. Partition and sub-library: horizontally or vertically split data to accommodate large amounts of data storage and high concurrent access. 7. Control concurrency: Improve database performance by controlling the number of concurrent connections, optimizing thread pools, and optimizing database connection pools. 8. Cache optimization: Use cache technology to reduce database query pressure and improve query performance, such as Redis. 9. Avoid large transactions: reduce the use of large transactions, avoid long-term table locks and resource competition, and improve database performance. 10. Monitor database performance: check database performance problems through monitoring tools, find and solve problems in time, and improve database performance.
