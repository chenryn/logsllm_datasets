FAMILY: IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION  
[FIPS 200] specifies the Identification and Authentication minimum security requirement as 
follows: 
Organizations must identify information system users, processes acting on behalf of 
users, or devices and authenticate (or verify) the identities of those users, processes, or 
devices, as a prerequisite to allowing access to organizational information systems.  
NIST SP 800-161, Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Federal Information Systems 
and Organizations, expands the [FIPS 200] identification and authentication control family to 
include the identification and authentication of components in addition to individuals (users) and 
processes acting on behalf of individuals within the supply chain network. Identification and 
authentication are critical to C-SCRM because they provide for the traceability of individuals, 
processes acting on behalf of individuals, and specific systems/components in an enterprise’s 
supply chain network. Identification and authentication are required to appropriately manage 
cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain to both reduce the risk of supply chain 
cybersecurity compromise and to generate evidence in case of supply chain cybersecurity 
compromise. 
IA-1 
POLICY AND PROCEDURES 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The enterprise should – at enterprise-defined intervals – review, 
enhance, and update their identity and access management policies and procedures to ensure that critical 
roles and processes within the supply chain network are defined and that the enterprise’s critical systems, 
components, and processes are identified for traceability. This should include the identity of critical 
components that may not have been considered under identification and authentication in the past. Note 
that providing identification for all items within the supply chain would be cost-prohibitive, and discretion 
should be used. The enterprise should update related C-SCRM Strategy/Implementation Plan(s), Policies, 
and C-SCRM Plans. 
Level(s): 1, 2, 3 
IA-2 
IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (ORGANIZATIONAL USERS) 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises should ensure that identification and requirements are 
defined and applied for enterprise users accessing an ICT/OT system or supply chain network. An 
enterprise user may include employees, individuals deemed to have the equivalent status of employees 
(e.g., contractors, guest researchers, etc.), and system integrators fulfilling contractor roles. Criteria such as 
“duration in role” can aid in defining which identification and authentication mechanisms are used. The 
enterprise may choose to define a set of roles and associate a level of authorization to ensure proper 
implementation. Enterprises should require their prime contractors to implement this control and flow 
down this requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors. Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix 
F to implement this guidance in accordance with Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s 
Cybersecurity.

DEVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises should implement capabilities to distinctly and positively 
identify devices and software within their supply chain and, once identified, verify that the identity is 
authentic. Devices that require unique device-to-device identification and authentication should be defined 
by type, device, or a combination of type and device. Software that requires authentication should be 
identified through a software identification tag (SWID) that enables verification of the software package 
and authentication of the enterprise releasing the software package.  
Level(s): 1, 2, 3 
IA-4  
IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Identifiers allow for greater discoverability and traceability. Within the 
enterprise’s supply chain, identifiers should be assigned to systems, individuals, documentation, devices, 
and components. In some cases, identifiers may be maintained throughout a system’s life cycle – from 
concept to retirement – but, at a minimum, throughout the system’s life within the enterprise.  
For software development, identifiers should be assigned for those components that have achieved 
configuration item recognition. For devices and operational systems, identifiers should be assigned when 
the items enter the enterprise’s supply chain, such as when they are transferred to the enterprise’s 
ownership or control through shipping and receiving or via download. 
Suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related 
service providers typically use their own identifiers for tracking purposes within their own supply chain. 
Enterprises should correlate those identifiers with the enterprise-assigned identifiers for traceability and 
accountability. Enterprises should require their prime contractors to implement this control and flow down 
this requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors. Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F to 
implement this guidance in accordance with Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity.

chain for service delivery (e.g., development/integration services, product support, etc.). Enterprises should 
manage the establishment, auditing, use, and revocation of identification credentials and the authentication 
of non-enterprise users within the supply chain. Enterprises should also ensure promptness in performing 
identification and authentication activities, especially in the case of revocation management, to help 
mitigate exposure to cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain such as those that arise due to insider 
threats.

should ensure that they know what services are being procured and from whom. Services procured should 
be listed on a validated list of services for the enterprise or have compensating controls in place. 
Enterprises should require their prime contractors to implement this control and flow down this 
requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors. Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F to 
implement this guidance in accordance with Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity.

FAMILY: INCIDENT RESPONSE 
[FIPS 200] specifies the Incident Response minimum security requirement as follows: 
Organizations must: (i) establish an operational incident handling capability for 
organizational information systems that includes adequate preparation, detection, 
analysis, containment, recovery, and user response activities; and (ii) track, document, 
and report incidents to appropriate organizational officials and/or authorities.  
Supply chain compromises may span suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system 
service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers. Enterprises should ensure that 
their incident response controls address C-SCRM including what, when, and how information 
about incidents will be reported or shared by, with, or between suppliers, developers, system 
integrators, external system service providers, other ICT/OT-related service providers, and any 
relevant interagency bodies. Incident response will help determine whether an incident is related 
to the supply chain.  
IR-1 
POLICY AND PROCEDURES 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises should integrate C-SCRM into incident response policy and 
procedures, and related C-SCRM Strategy/Implementation Plans and Policies. The policy and procedures 
must provide direction for how to address supply chain-related incidents and cybersecurity incidents that 
may complicate or impact the supply chain. Individuals who work within specific mission and system 
environments need to recognize cybersecurity supply chain-related incidents. The incident response policy 
should state when and how threats and incidents should be handled, reported, and managed.  
Additionally, the policy should define when, how, and with whom to communicate to the FASC (Federal 
Acquisition Security Council) and other stakeholders or partners within the broader supply chain in the 
event of a cyber threat or incident. Departments and agencies must notify the FASC of supply chain risk 
information when the FASC requests information relating to a particular source, covered article, or 
procures or an executive agency has determined that there is a reasonable basis to conclude a substantial 
supply chain risk associated with a source, covered procurement, or covered article exists. In such 
instances, the executive agency shall provide the FASC with relevant information concerning the source or 
covered article, including 1) the supply chain risk information identified through the course of the agency’s 
activities in furtherance of mitigating, identifying, or managing its supply chain risk and 2) the supply chain 
risk information regarding covered procurement actions by the agency under the Federal Acquisition 
Supply Chain Security Act of 2018 (FASCSA) 41 U.S.C. § 4713; and any orders issued by the agency 
under 41 U.S.C. § 4713.  
Bidirectional communication with supply chain partners should be defined in agreements with suppliers, 
developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service 
providers to inform all involved parties of a supply chain cybersecurity incident. Incident information may 
also be shared with enterprises such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), US CERT (United States 
Computer Emergency Readiness Team), and the NCCIC (National Cybersecurity and Communications 
Integration Center) as appropriate. Depending on the severity of the incident, the need for accelerated 
communications up and down the supply chain may be necessary. Appropriate agreements should be put in 
place with suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-
related service providers to ensure speed of communication, response, corrective actions, and other related 
activities. Enterprises should require their prime contractors to implement this control and flow down this 
requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors.

POLICY AND PROCEDURES | C-SCRM INCIDENT INFORMATION SHARING 
Enterprises should ensure that their incident response policies and procedures provide guidance on 
effective information sharing of incidents and other key risk indicators in the supply chain. Guidance 
should – at a minimum – cover the collection, synthesis, and distribution of incident information from 
a diverse set of data sources, such as public data repositories, paid subscription services, and in-house 
threat intelligence teams. 
Enterprises that operate in the public sector should include specific guidance on when and how to 
communicate with interagency partnerships, such as the FASC (Federal Acquisition Security Council) 
and other stakeholders or partners within the broader supply chain, in the event of a cyber threat or 
incident.  
Departments and agencies must notify the FASC of supply chain risk information when: 
1) The FASC requests information relating to a particular source or covered article, or 
2) An executive agency has determined that there is a reasonable basis to conclude that a 
substantial supply chain risk associated with a source, covered procurement, or covered article 
exists. 
In such instances, the executive agency shall provide the FASC with relevant information concerning 
the source or covered article, including:  
1) Supply chain risk information identified through the course of the agency’s activities in 
furtherance of mitigating, identifying, or managing its supply chain risk and 
2) Supply chain risk information regarding covered procurement actions by the agency under the 
Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act of 2018 (FASCSA) 41 U.S.C. § 4713; and

INCIDENT HANDLING | SUPPLY CHAIN COORDINATION 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: A number of enterprises may be involved in managing incidents 
and responses for supply chain security. After initially processing the incident and deciding on a course 
of action (in some cases, the action may be “no action”), the enterprise may need to coordinate with 
their suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, other ICT/OT-related 
service providers, and any relevant interagency bodies to facilitate communications, incident response, 
root cause, and corrective actions. Enterprises should securely share information through a coordinated 
set of personnel in key roles to allow for a more comprehensive incident handling approach. Selecting 
suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related 
service providers with mature capabilities for supporting supply chain cybersecurity incident handling 
is important for reducing exposure to cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. If transparency 
for incident handling is limited due to the nature of the relationship, define a set of acceptable criteria 
in the agreement (e.g., contract). A review (and potential revision) of the agreement is recommended, 
based on the lessons learned from previous incidents. Enterprises should require their prime 
contractors to implement this control and flow down this requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors.
