### Family: Identification and Authentication

**[FIPS 200] Requirement:**
Organizations must identify information system users, processes acting on behalf of users, or devices and authenticate (or verify) the identities of those users, processes, or devices, as a prerequisite to allowing access to organizational information systems.

**NIST SP 800-161r1 Expansion:**
Expands the [FIPS 200] identification and authentication control family to include the identification and authentication of components in addition to individuals (users) and processes acting on behalf of individuals within the supply chain network.

**Importance:**
Identification and authentication are critical to C-SCRM because they provide traceability and reduce the risk of supply chain cybersecurity compromise.

**Control ID: IA-1 - Policy and Procedures**
