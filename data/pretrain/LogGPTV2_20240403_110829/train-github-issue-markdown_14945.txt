My screen has a resolution of 2K with a DPI zoom set to 200%. To illustrate the issue, here are two examples:

1. This is the image displayed after running the application:

2. This is an image saved with a DPI setting of 300:

The point I am making is that GUI applications often do not display optimally on high-resolution screens.
