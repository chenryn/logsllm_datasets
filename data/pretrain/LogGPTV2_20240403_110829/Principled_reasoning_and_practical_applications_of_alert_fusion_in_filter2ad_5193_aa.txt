ABSTRACT
It is generally believed that by combining several diverse intrusion
detectors (i.e., forming an IDS ensemble), we may achieve better
there has been very little work on
performance. However,
analyzing the effectiveness of an IDS ensemble.
In this paper,
we study the following problem: how to make a good fusion
decision on the alerts from multiple detectors in order to improve
the ﬁnal performance. We propose a decision-theoretic alert fusion
technique based on the likelihood ratio test (LRT). We report
our experience from empirical studies, and formally analyze its
practical interpretation based on ROC curve analysis. Through
theoretical reasoning and experiments using multiple IDSs on
several data sets, we show that our technique is more ﬂexible and
also outperforms other existing fusion techniques such as AND,
OR, majority voting, and weighted voting.

INTRODUCTION
Diversity is a well-established approach for increasing the
reliability of systems: if we want a computer service to be always
available, we can use diversity to make it more difﬁcult for an attack
to take down an entire set of diverse computers or mechanisms.
In Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), different detectors provide
complementary information about the patterns to be classiﬁed.
Some detectors1 are effective in detecting a certain type of attack,
while others aim to detect different types. A single intrusion
detection algorithm (or anomaly classiﬁer) cannot easily detect all
kinds of intrusions/anomalies. Similarly, different classiﬁers are
likely to make different kind of errors on normal data. Thus, a
reasonable approach is not to rely on any single classiﬁer for a
decision, but a fusion rule to combine diverse classiﬁers to reach
a ﬁnal decision.
Now suppose we have a set of diverse IDSs reporting on the
same event.
If some IDSs output an alarm while others do not,
should the fusion rule output an alarm? This is the so-called IDS
fusion problem. A conservative (or, security-conscious) fusion rule
will always output an alarm whenever one of the underlying IDSs
outputs an alarm. However, this simple approach is inadequate in
many situations. It does not ﬁlter the alerts from underlying IDSs
and does not resolve conﬂicting votes from the IDSs (i.e., when
some say “normal” and others say “attack” or “suspicious”). As a
result, it produces as many alarms as the sum of all alarms from all
the underlying IDSs. And since it does not provide a conﬁdence
attribute to the alarms, security analysts can be overwhelmed by
the need to inspect a large number of alerts (including many false
alarms).
In this paper, we make the following contributions:
• We propose the use of the likelihood ratio test (LRT)
technique as a principled and practical way of combining
different alarm reports.
• We study the effectiveness of the LRT rule empirically by
using several IDSs on two different data sets and comparing
its performance to several other fusion approaches.
• We provide a novel theoretical analysis of the LRT rule, and
the resulting binary decision functions. We also show the
practical intuition of the LRT rule when applied to the IDS
fusion problem, and provide a novel practical interpretation
of these results using ROC curves.
• We test the robustness of the LRT fusion rule with respect
to possible parameter estimation errors (these parameters
include the false positive rate, false negative rate, and base
rate).

Our analysis shows that the LRT rule has several key character-
istics:
1Although there are some difference between the terms of detector,
sensor, and classiﬁer, they are basically the same components in
our model (Figure 1).
In the rest of the paper, we may use
IDS/detector/sensor/classiﬁer interchangeably.

• If the risk model is known (i.e., if we have the knowledge
of the operating costs of the IDS, and the likelihood of an
attack), the LRT rule can be shown to be the fusion rule that
minimizes the average cost.
• Instead, if we do not assume any costs, we can use Neyman-
Pearson theory to show that by tuning a threshold, we ﬁnd the
optimal tradeoff between false alarms and missed detections.
• Finally, if we do not make any assumption, the LRT fusion
rule can be seen as a principled ranking algorithm, placing a
level of suspicion on each event, depending on which IDSs
output alarms (and which ones did not). A ranking algorithm
will thus help the operators of IDSs identify and check only
the most suspicious events (given their time constraints).
Our results also show that our approach outperforms other fusion
approaches (e.g., AND, OR, majority voting, weighted voting) in
achieving the lower overall cost in various risk scenarios, and in
providing a principled ranking algorithm for alarms.

2. RELATED WORK
There are several ways for combining classiﬁers in the machine
learning literature. For ensemble methods [29, 14] such as bagging
[8], or boosting [17], the goal is to generate different classiﬁers
by resampling or reweighing the training data set. The decision
rules applied to the generated classiﬁers are majority voting or
weighted voting.
In contrast, our method takes any given set of
binary classiﬁers and ﬁnds optimal combination rules from a more
general space of functions (i.e., our fusion rules are not restricted
to be majority voting or weighted voting).
Another method for combining classiﬁers is stacking [51].
Stacking trains a meta-learner to combine the predictions of several
base classiﬁers. This meta-learner is in general, a machine learning
algorithm such as a neural network, or a support vector machine.
The problem with these algorithms is that their classiﬁcation rules
are difﬁcult to interpret, and that their objective is to minimize
the probability of error; a metric that is not well suited for the
evaluation of intrusion detection systems [9, 30, 20]. Our method,
however, can be considered to be a stacking approach with the
LRT rule as a particular meta-classiﬁer. We have showed that LRT
performs well and can outperform previously proposed stacking
approaches [5].
In this paper we show how the LRT rule can
be easily interpreted. Furthermore, we show how the LRT is
particularly well suited for the complex trade-off between false
positive rate (F P , the probability that the IDS outputs an alarm
in case of no actual intrusion), and false negative rate (F N,
the probability that the IDS outputs no alarm when an intrusion
actually occurs).
Recently, IDS researchers have also proposed and applied other
machine learning techniques [31, 13, 18, 46, 28, 26, 27, 40]. Lee
[31] applied meta-classiﬁcation to improve accuracy and
et al.
efﬁciency, and to make data mining based IDSs more adaptable.
Didaci et al. [13] and Giacinto and Roli [18] applied three different
meta-classiﬁcation methods proposed in [52] to the outputs of three
neural networks trained on different feature sets from the KDD
tcpdump data. Kruegel
et al. [28] proposed to use Bayesian
networks to improve the aggregation of different detector outputs.
In [26, 27], Kruegel and Vigna proposed several Web anomaly
detectors and combined them using weighted voting.
In [40],
Perdisci et al. proposed an ensemble (using majority voting) of
several one-class SVM classiﬁers (using different feature set) to
harden payload-based anomaly detection systems.
In [6], Bass
pointed out that the art and science of (multisensor) data fusion is
applicable to intrusion detection, and discussed several challenges
in IDS fusion. Shankar [44] applied the data fusion technique to
detect and track rapidly propagating intrusions. Valeur et al. [47]
proposed a comprehensive framework for intrusion detection alert
correlation, partially including alert fusion. This work showed
that by combining multiple classiﬁers to detect intrusions, we can
improve accuracy to some degree, however, none of these efforts
explored the theoretical or practical advantages of the LRT rule.
When combining alerts from different IDSs, we need to
distinguish between alert fusion [6, 44, 47] and alert correlation
[47, 12, 41, 39, 11]. The alert fusion problem is the combination
of alerts representing independent detection of the same attack
occurrence [47], while the alert correlation problem attempts to
group alerts and provide a more succinct, high-level view of the
intrusions attempts (typically done via attack graphs or attack
scenarios). Compared to alert correlation, alert fusion is a very
narrow and speciﬁc process. However, there is very little work
deﬁning a formal and principled framework for alert fusion where
the operational performance is evaluated under clearly deﬁned
metrics. In this paper we address this concern.
One of our main evaluation metrics is cost.
In cost-based
analysis there were several efforts. In the machine learning ﬁeld,
Adacost [16] is an enhanced Adaboost that considers cost factors.
However the interpretation of the output of an ensemble using
these techniques is mostly based only on good empirical results,
limiting the understanding that an IDS analyst must have when
receiving an alarm.
In the intrusion detection area, Lee and
Fan [30, 15, 45] were among the ﬁrst to explore cost-sensitive
approaches for intrusion detection. A very detailed case-example
of identifying costs in a large network was done by Arora [3].
Although identifying the associated costs is not an easy task, it is
essential for risk management; a major component of an overall
strategy for information security. In this paper we study the cost-
aware structure for the alert fusion problem.
3. DECISION-THEORETIC
ALERT
FUSION FOR AN IDS ENSEMBLE
3.1 Formal Model of IDS Fusion
In our IDS fusion model, each intrusion detector analyzes the
data (e.g., network trafﬁc), and outputs whether it is anomalous or
normal. Formally, we can model the observation of each data unit
(packet or ﬂow, depending on the analysis unit of the detector) with
two status, either normal (H0) or anomaly (H1). In the ensemble,
we assume each detector have the same unit of analysis (same
granularity of alert, see [19] for an extended discussion on handling
other cases). Each IDSi (i = 1, ..., n; n ≥ 2) observing the
data unit (e.g., network packet) makes its own decision yi as H1
(in this case it outputs yi = 1) or H0 (it outputs yi = 0). All
the decisions of individual detectors (which form a decision vector
(cid:126)Y = {y1, ..., yn}) will be gathered at a fusion center, and a global
decision will be made (Figure 1). y0 is the ﬁnal decision reported
to the network security administrator.

3.2 Decision-Theoretic Alert Fusion Based on
LRT
The likelihood ratio test (LRT) is a statistical
test of the
goodness-of-ﬁt between two test models. Based on LRT technique,
which is commonly used in data fusion, we have the following
theorem [49, 22].
It provides an optimal decision algorithm for
combining alerts of the IDS ensemble.
THEOREM 1. Given that every IDS makes its own decision, the
following fusion rule can minimize the expected cost Cexp

This algorithm tells us that if the left part of the equation is
greater than the right, then the ﬁnal decision yields output y0 = 1
(anomaly); otherwise, it yields output y0 = 0 (normal). If they are
equal, we can arbitrarily pick either decision.
