`OptionsResolve::resolve` method produces `Options::all` call before
validating option values. `Options::all` call then executes normalizers with
options that have not been validated yet. This makes it impossible to
constrain options that are passed to normalizers in form types, like
`ChoiceType`, `CollectionType`, `CountryType`, `LanguageType`, `LocaleType`,
`TimezoneType`, `TimeType` and `CurrencyType`.
