hacker tools, and Web-enabled open source intelligence (OSINT).
The physical limits of desktop computing are approaching. For example, electronic 
circuitry may be reaching its minimum physical size, and the maximum rate at 
which information can move through any computer system may be limited by the 
finite speed of light.
However, the simultaneous rise of “cyberspace” solves this problem. In 2010, there 
were nearly one billion computers connected directly to the Internet, and over 1.5 
billion Internet users on Earth.31 Today, a reliable connection to the Internet is more 
important than the power of one’s computer and provides infinitely greater utility 
to the user.
The Rise of Malicious Code
Together, computers and computer networks offer individuals, organizations, and 
governments the ability to acquire and exploit information at unprecedented speed. 
In business, diplomacy, and military might, this translates into a competitive advan-
tage, suggesting that brains will beat brawn with increasing frequency over time 
and that computer resources will play a central role in future human conflict.
The original meaning of the term “hacker” was quite positive. It meant a very clever 
user of technology, specifically someone who modified hardware or software in or-
der to stretch its limits, especially to take it beyond where its inventors had intended

it to go. Over time, however, the criminalization of hacking has led to a decay of the 
word’s original meaning.
Regardless of a hacker’s intentions, there are three basic forms of cyber attack32 that 
national security planners should keep in mind.
The first type of attack targets the confidentiality of data. It encompasses any un-
authorized acquisition of information, including via “traffic analysis,” in which an 
attacker infers communication content merely by observing communication pat-
terns. Because global network connectivity is currently well ahead of global and 
local network security, it can be easy for hackers to steal enormous amounts of 
sensitive information.
For example, in 2009 a Canadian research group called Information Warfare Moni-
tor revealed the existence of “GhostNet,” a cyber espionage network of over 1,000 
compromised computers in 103 countries that targeted diplomatic, political, eco-
nomic, and military information.33
The second type of attack targets the integrity of information. This includes the 
“sabotage” of data for criminal, political, or military purposes. Cyber criminals have 
been known to encrypt the data on a victim’s hard drive and then demand a ransom 
payment in exchange for the decryption key. Some countries with poor human rights 
records have been accused of editing the email and blog entries of their citizens.34
The third type of attack targets the availability of computers or information resourc-
es. The goal here is to prevent authorized users from gaining access to the systems 
or data they require to perform certain tasks. This is commonly referred to as a 
denial-of-service (DoS) and encompasses a wide range of malware, network traffic, 
or physical attacks on computers, databases, and the networks that connect them.
In 2001, “MafiaBoy,” a 15 year-old student from Montreal, conducted a successful 
DoS attack against some of the world’s biggest online companies, likely causing over 
$1 billion in financial damage.35 In 2007, Syrian air defense was reportedly disabled 
by a cyber attack moments before the Israeli air force demolished an alleged nuclear 
reactor.36  And the Burmese government, during a government crackdown on politi-
cal protestors, completely severed its Internet connection to the outside world.37

The term “cyber” is used generically to describe computers, networks, and digital information.

BIRTH OF A CONCEPT: STRATEGIC CYBER SECURITY
If computer users were isolated from one another, computer security management 
would be straightforward and rely primarily on personnel background checks and 
padlocks. But the benefits of networking are too great to ignore. Modern organiza-
tions require Internet connectivity.
The trick is to find the right balance between functionality, performance, and secu-
rity. It is impossible to optimize the equilibrium with respect to all attacks. Before a 
military operation, if every soldier knew every detail of the plan, morale and readi-
ness might improve, but it would be far easier for the enemy to become witting as 
well. On the other hand, when too few soldiers are in the know, the odds of success 
are lower.38
As during WW II, the national security community continued to lead the way. By 
1967, the U.S. military had configured an IBM System/360 network with discrete 
levels of clearance, compartments, need-to-know, and centralized authority control. 
In the civilian world, however, system administrators could not prevent users from 
reading the data of another user until 1970. And even then, the administrative goal 
was to prevent accidental data corruption, not to protect users from one another.39
As Internet connectivity grew, malicious users and computer hackers were able to 
conduct increasingly asymmetric attacks. In theory, an attacker can target all Inter-
net-connected computers simultaneously, with an attack that travels at near light-
speed. The strength of the Internet – an accessible, collaborative framework based 
on common technologies and protocols – unfortunately makes it vulnerable to novel 
attacks and susceptible to swift and massive damage.
The notion of a computer worm or virus dates to 1949, when the mathematician 
John von Neumann proposed “self-replicating automata.” However, such malware 
remained in an experimental stage40 until the early 1990s.41 Hackers wrote viral 
programs such as the Creeper worm, which infected ARPANET42 in 1971 and a 1988 
Internet virus that exploited weak passwords in SUN and VAX computers. However, 
these programs did not yet attempt to steal or destroy data.43

Cyber Security: A Short History
During the 1990s, as the number of Internet users grew exponentially, there was 
an explosion of malware, in both quantity and quality. In 2003, a DARPA44-funded 
study45 categorized the known Internet worms46 by attacker motivation:
• experimental curiosity (Morris/ILoveYou),
• non-existent or non-functional payload (Morris/Slammer),
• backdoor creation for remote control (Code Red II),
• HTML proxy, spam relay, phishing (Sobig),
• DoS (Code Red/Yaha),
• Distributed DoS (Stacheldraht),
• criminal data collection, espionage (SirCam),
• data damage (Chernobyl/Klez), and
• political protest (Yaha).
Clearly, the goal of computer hacking is limited only by the attacker’s imagination. 
The DARPA study speculated that future worms could facilitate human surveillance, 
commercial advantage, the management of distributed malware, terrorist recon-
naissance, and even the manipulation of critical infrastructures in support of cyber 
war objectives.
Why are hackers so successful, and are we improving our defenses against them?
Fortunately, an enormous amount of attention has been drawn to cyber security. For 
example, in 2002, Microsoft advertised its Trustworthy Computing Initiative, de-
claring that security would henceforth be at the forefront of Window’s development.

Five worm characteristics were analyzed: target discovery, method of transmission, code activation, 
payload, and attacker motivation. Motivation is normally learned by studying the payload, or the non-
propagation code, of malware.
46 
A computer worm is a program that self-propagates across a network, exploiting security or policy 
flaws in widely-used services. Viruses typically infect non-mobile files and normally require some 
user action to move them across a network. Thus the propagation rate of a worm is typically much 
faster than with a virus.

BIRTH OF A CONCEPT: STRATEGIC CYBER SECURITY
Unfortunately, many common computer vulnerabilities are of a persistent nature.47 
These include:
• the high cost of producing quality software,48
• technical challenges associated with software patch deployment,
• susceptibility of the commonly-used C/C++ languages to buffer overflows and 
code-injection,49
• use of administrator rights by common system and user programs,50 and
• the prevalence of “monoculture” computing environments.51
The computer security problem space is both broad and deep. In terms of quantity, 
in the single month of May 2009, Kaspersky Lab identified 42,520 unique samples 
of possible malware on its clients’ computers.
In terms of quality, the cyber defense community is currently analyzing the most 
sophisticated piece of malware yet found – Stuxnet.52 This worm targeted national 
critical infrastructures, specifically the SCADA53 systems used to manage major in-
dustrial installations such as power grids and the Programmable Logic Controllers 
(PLCs) used to control devices such as pumps and valves.
Stuxnet’s propagation strategy is a wonder to behold. It exploits at least four zero-
day54 vulnerabilities and employs two stolen digital certificates.55 It targets “air-
gapped”56 networks via removable USB drives and is smart enough to attempt its 
exploits only when connected to a SCADA environment. Finally, in 2010, most of the

Unfortunately, even the most robust and scrutinized software, such as OpenSSH, OpenSSL and 
Apache, have been shown to contain major security vulnerabilities.
49 
These refer to attacks that target ostensibly inaccessible computer memory space and the exploitation 
of flaws in a computer program to insert unauthorized hacker code.
50 
Hackers take advantage of the fact that malicious code normally runs at the level of the user who 
executes it. This is why one should never surf the Web from an Administrator account.

The Windows operating system, for example, commands about 90% of the desktop market share.

Stuxnet was discovered by a Belarusian anti-virus firm in June 2010, but the worm had been active 
on the Internet, undetected, for at least one year.

infected machines were located in a country of high interest to intelligence agencies 
around the world – Iran.57
A strategic challenge for cyber defense is that the Internet evolves so quickly it is 
impossible for any organization to master all of the latest developments. Over time, 
attackers have subverted an ever-increasing number of operating systems, applica-
tions, and communications protocols. Defenders simply have too much technical 
ground to cover, which is to a hacker’s advantage and places a premium on defen-
sive creativity, good intelligence, and some level of automated attack detection and 
response.
Lone Hacker to Cyber Army
Information operations are surely as old as warfare itself. A well-known example 
from the 20th century is the spectacular effort by the Allies to convince the Ger-
man military leadership that the D-Day invasion would take place at Pas-de-Calais 
instead of Normandy.58
The first mention of a forthcoming “information war” in cyberspace is attributed 
to Thomas Rona, the author of a 1976 Boeing Corporation research paper entitled 
“Weapon Systems and Information War.”59 Rona perceived that computer networks 
were both an asset and a liability for any organization. Once a mission came to rely 
on the proper functioning of IT for success, computer systems would be among the 
first targets in war. Rona argued that all information flows within any command-
and-control system are vulnerable to jamming, overloading, or spoofing by an ad-
versary.60
In 1993, a widely-cited U.S. Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) article examined the 
historical aspects of “cyberwar.” Its authors argued that the Information Revolu-
tion would change not only how wars are fought, but even why wars are fought. IT 
offered the world such increased organizational efficiency and improved decision-
making that traditional hierarchies and political systems would be forced to evolve 
or die, and even international borders would have to be redrawn.
For militaries, IT-enhanced situational awareness was compared to the 13th cen-
tury Mongol army’s use of “arrow riders” on horseback to keep national leadership 
informed of distant battlefield developments with astonishing speed and to the ad-
vantage a chess player would have over a blindfolded opponent. Cyberwar could be

BIRTH OF A CONCEPT: STRATEGIC CYBER SECURITY
to the 21st century what blitzkrieg or “lightning war” was to the 20th century, and 
a standard military goal will be to turn the balance of information control in one’s 
favor, especially if the balance of conventional forces is not.
The NPS professors envisioned two levels of Internet conflict: a “netwar” of diploma-
cy and propaganda, and “cyberwar,” which would encompass all military operations 
designed to attack an adversary’s critical IT systems.61
In 2001, computer scientists from the Carnegie Mellon University Computer Emer-
gency Response Team (CERT) wrote an article for the NATO Review, “Countering 
Cyber War,” which argued that cyber attacks would play an increasingly strategic 
role in warfare and that NATO must immediately begin to plan for the defense of 
cyberspace.
The CERT team described three levels of cyber warfare. The first is a simple adjunct 
to traditional military operations to gain information superiority, such as by target-
ing an air defense system. However, because military functions such as early warn-
ing have an intrinsic strategic value to a nation, a successful cyber attack against air 
defense could lead to strategic losses.
The second level is “limited” cyber war. Here, civilian Internet infrastructure be-
comes part of the battleground, and the target list includes some civilian enterprises.
The third and most serious level is “unrestricted” cyber war. Here, an adversary 
seeks to cause maximum damage to civilian infrastructure in order to rupture the 
“social fabric” of a nation. Air-traffic control, stock exchange, emergency services, 
and power generation systems62 could be targets. The goal is as much physical dam-
age and as many civilian casualties as possible.63
In 2001, James Adams revealed in the pages of Foreign Affairs that the U.S. Depart-
ment of Defense had in fact put cyber war theories to a real-world test in a classi-
fied 1997 Red Team exercise codenamed “Eligible Receiver.” Thirty-five U.S. National 
Security Agency (NSA) personnel, simulating North Korean hackers, used a variety 
of cyber and information warfare (IW) tools and tactics, including the transmission 
of fabricated military orders and news reports, to attack the U.S. Navy’s Pacific Com-
mand from cyberspace. The Red Team was so successful that the Navy’s “human 
command-and-control system” was paralyzed by mistrust, and “nobody ... from the 
president on down, could believe anything.”64

Successful attacks on electricity grids have subsequent, unforeseeable effects on an economy 
because most infrastructures, including computer systems, rely on electricity to function.
