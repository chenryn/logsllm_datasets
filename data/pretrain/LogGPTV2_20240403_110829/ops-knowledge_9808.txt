User: Use Python to write an automated test script that verifies that a web application meets expected functional requirements.
Assistant: The following is an example of an automated test script written in Python to verify the login functionality of a web application: ``` import unittest from selenium import webdriver class LoginTest(unittest.TestCase): def setUp(self): self.driver = webdriver .Chrome() self.driver.maximize_window() def tearDown(self): self.driver.quit() def test_login(self): self.driver.get("https://www.example.com/login") # Enter username and password username_field = self.driver.find_element_by_id("username") username_field.send_keys("myuser") password_field = self.driver.find_element_by_id("password") password_field.send_keys("mypassword") #click the login button login_button = self.driver.find_element_by_css_selector("input[type='submit']") login_button.click() # Wait for the page to load self.driver.implicitly_wait(10) # Verify login success welcome_message = self.driver.find_element_by_css_selector("h1. welcome-message") self.assertEqual(welcome_message.text, "Welcome, myuser!") if __name__ == "__main__": unittest.main() ``` In the example above, we used Python's unittest module to write A test case class LoginTest, which inherits from the unittest.TestCase class. In the setUp method, we create an instance of the Chrome browser and maximize the window. In the tearDown method, we close the browser instance. In the test_login method, we first opened the login page through the get method, then found the input boxes for the user name and password, and entered the correct values. Then click the login button, wait for the page to load, try to find the welcome message, and assert that its text content is the same as expected. Finally, the unittest.main() method is called under the condition of if __name__ == "__main__" to run the test case. When we run this test script, it will open an instance of Chrome, automatically enter the username and password on the login page, click the login button, wait for the page to load, find the welcome message, and assert that its text content is the same as expected. If all goes well, the test case will pass with OK output. In case of an error or failure, the test case will throw an appropriate exception or error message.
