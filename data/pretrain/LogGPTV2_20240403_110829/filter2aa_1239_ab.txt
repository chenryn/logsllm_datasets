Rented botnets have been successfully offered as a service by cybercrime groups, since 
they realized that such a huge computing power can be better utilized when rented “by the 
hour” to multiple users – much like the early computer systems were, and the way 
supercomputers are rented today.   
The Estonian botnet operation could only have been carried out by a botnet with enough 
capacity to immobilize the Estonian infrastructure. This means that most of the botnet was 
utilized at once. This is something that is rarely done, since botnets are typically rented in 
small chunks to maximize financial potential.  
An operation of this scale would have to be commissioned by government agencies, which 
probably already had ties with criminal groups operating within the RBN. The fact that RBN 
has, on several occasions, been associated with Russian officials and the fact that it was 
resurrected after its dispersion is another indication of the involvement of Russian 
government agencies in the Estonian cyber war. 
Our conclusion is that there is a substantial link between cybercrime and cyber warfare in 
the case of shut-down of the Estonian infrastructure during 2007.

Georgia 
The Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 poses a more interesting dilemma: during the 
conflict itself (which was kinetic, as opposed to the Estonian conflict that was purely 
computer-generated) there were more than a few incidents where cyber attacks were 
synchronized with troop movements on the ground.  
The initial cyber attack was directed at the Georgian president!s website. It was a simple yet 
effective DDoS attack:  
flood http www.president.gov.ge  
flood tcp www.president.gov.ge  
flood icmp www.president.gov.ge 
The DDoS was quieted down by the Russians for a few days: the C&C servers (Command 
and Control servers used to manage a botnet) deployed in the initial attack were taken 
offline as Russian troops crossed the border towards Georgia,. 
Shortly after the ground troops started engaging the Georgian forces, six new C&C servers 
started issuing DDoS attack commands on select Georgian websites, including: 
www.president.gov.ge  
www.parliament.ge  
apsny.ge  
news.ge  
tbilisiweb.info  
newsgeorgia.ru  
os-inform.com  
www.kasparov.ru  
hacking.ge mk.ru  
newstula.info  
skandaly.ru 
The interesting part is the difference between the initial C&C servers that launched the 
attack on the president!s website, and the six C&C servers that launched the attacks on the 
rest of the websites.  
The six servers that launched the later attacks were much more capable and less dedicated 
to the Georgia attack: while commanding their botnets to attack Georgian Internet facilities, 
the servers were also taking care of "regular business”: attacking sites that included Porn, 
adult escort services, carder forums5 and gambling sites. 
This is a clear indication that a cybercrime group has been managing the later C&C servers. 
Other indices include the fact that the servers themselves were registered through 
www.naunet.ru - a known “bulletproof hosting” provider in Russia; and the fact that the 
domains used for lunching the attacks were registered and hosted by www.steadyhost.ru - a 
known front for cybercrime activities.  
Steadyhost.ru is using a network provided by its parent company, “Innovative IT solutions”. 
“Innovative IT Solutions” is masked by a mail-drop in London, and actually owns and 
operates the subnet used for hosting the servers that attacked the Georgian websites (at IP 
addresses 74.86.81.232-239 and 75.126.142.96-111). 
Criminal activities conducted by the "bulletproof" host in Russia, along with the Georgian 
attacks, included (like in the case of RBN in the Estonian cyber attack) mostly criminal 
activities such as forgery, money laundering and renting out botnets for spamming and 
extortion purposes.  
It is our opinion that those three variables – commercial criminal activities by the attacking 
servers, ties to Russian entities as well as criminal entities - together with the Kremlin!s 
5 Forums in which “carders” (criminals in the credit card fraud industry) are trading stolen cards and criminal 
related information.

policy and tactics regarding operation of RBN and similar businesses in Russia, make a 
clear case for a connection between the Russian Government and cybercrime. A connection 
that in the Georgian case was used to deploy one of the most synchronized kinetic-cyber 
attacks in history, while enabling the Russian government to deny any connection between 
the two.  
Twitter, Google and the APT 
The grouping of the Twitter and Google incidents during 2009 and 2010 is not coincidental. 
Although the media has attributed the incidents to two different countries (Iran and China), if 
we check their methods of operation we can see they are quite similar and link back to the 
"classic" cybercrime methods of operation we have witnessed over the past few years. 
In the first incident, an “out of nowhere” attack on December 18th 2009 affected Twitter!s 
DNS server in the US in a way that allowed the attackers to point traffic intended for Twitter 
to attacker-controlled servers. 
The attack was attributed to a group called the “Iranian Cyber Army” (as identified by the 
webpage presented to users trying to access www.twitter.com).  
There was no “Iranian Cyber Army” before the Twitter attack. There is, however, a group 
called “Ashiyane” that was active both in the political side of hacking and directly in 
cybercrime. Ashiyane has a small sub-group called the “Iranian Cyber Army”. 
Ashiyane had been training hackers for some time and their forums were running contests 
called “wargames”. The contest targeted different websites, prompting an “all-out” attack on 
these sites in order to gain access, steal data, modify it, implant false data or deface the site.  
Some of the targets named during these "wargames" were clearly related to critical 
infrastructure (such as a natural gas provider in the US). 
At the same time, Ashiyane was conducting more traditional cybercrime activities such as 
credit card fraud, breaches to customer databases, to financial institutions and to personal 
information used for spamming and identity theft. 
The operational duality of a cybercrime organization – conducting "commercial" alongside 
political cybercrime - is endorsed by governments who benefit first from an affective and 
highly covert form of combat, and second from the income generated by commercial criminal 
activities. 
The Twitter attack was carried out using stolen credentials used to manage the DNS 
services used by Twitter. This kind of data theft is often carried out by cybercrime 
organizations in order to gain access to business data. The data is then sold for the purpose 
of corporate espionage, to extort businesses or disrupt their services.  This practice is a 
notable part of the “training” provided at the Ashiyane group as part of its criminal activity. 
Another factor tying the Twitter cyber crime activity to the Iranian government was the move 
by the Iranian army to seize an Iraqi oil well on December 18th - the same exact day the 
Twitter DNS attack took place. 
A kinetic action done in conjunction with a cyber-attack on Twitter - a major resource of anti-
Iranian messaging (and a channel for opposition groups to speak out to the world) - is a 
textbook example of how a government can combine cyber warfare with traditional warfare 
to great effect.  
Google's experience with the Chinese government (together with Adobe and a few dozen 
other companies operating in the US) is almost the same as that of Twitter and the Iranian 
government.

Although the notion of “APT” (Advanced Persistent Threat) started to pop up in the media 
only in early 2010, the concept has been known by  cybercrime researchers for a long time. 
In fact, most of the tools used in cybercrime in the past 3-4 years are actually APTs, such as 
trojans, rootkits and keyloggers.  
All of them go undetected most of the time (hence their continued success) and perform 
advanced functions, from network scanning to selective information gathering and providing 
additional footholds over the breached networks.  
Google has been hit by a somewhat older version of the threat (dubbed Aurora) that has a 
fairly simple command and control structure and local capabilities. The interesting part in the 
breach (which affected over 40 companies) that ended up on the news is the fact that the 
attacks were highly targeted and abused undisclosed vulnerabilities. This enabled the 
perpetrators to install the trojans on Google's equipment.  
Again, attacks came from servers linked to China, and again, this does not necessarily mean 
the Chinese government commissioned attacks on US companies. However, one cannot 
ignore the connection between the Chinese government and these criminal activities, 
especially when their targets do not yield any of the typical revenues of cybercrime and 
when these attacks serve political aims (in Google!s case one of the goals was to infiltrate 
the mail accounts of Chinese human rights activists). 
Conclusion 
Having seen how cybercrime and cyber warfare interconnect, along with the covert nature of 
cyber warfare and the near impossibility of cracking down on it, it is obvious that combat in 
the cyber sphere cannot be handled in the traditional form of combat. 
While in the past command and control of national cyber warfare was in the hands of a 
central agency with direct reports, its future looks more like international espionage: 
including agents that can only be partially trusted, suppliers of arms (technology) that are 
also active in underground or illegal activities and presence in countries that may not be 
directly involved. 
On the bright side, current efforts by law enforcement agencies to battle cybercrime may 
actually turn out to be useful against cyber warfare. We also foresee a move toward 
international cyber-treaties which would be based on the lessons learned at the field battling 
cybercrime. Treaties along the lines of the recent US-Russian nuclear arms treaty, signed at 
the end of March 2010 may pave the way for similar ones on the cyber front.
