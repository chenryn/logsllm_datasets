### Rented Botnets and Cybercrime as a Service

Cybercrime groups have effectively offered rented botnets as a service, recognizing that the substantial computing power of these networks can be more efficiently utilized when leased by the hour to multiple users. This model is reminiscent of the early days of computer systems and the current practice of renting supercomputers.

### The Estonian Botnet Operation

The Estonian botnet operation, which immobilized the country's infrastructure, required a botnet with significant capacity. Typically, botnets are rented in smaller segments to maximize financial gain, making the full utilization of a botnet for such an attack unusual. Given the scale of the operation, it is likely that it was commissioned by government agencies, possibly with ties to criminal groups within the Russian Business Network (RBN). The RBN's repeated associations with Russian officials and its resurrection after initial dispersion further suggest the involvement of Russian government agencies in the Estonian cyber attack.

### Conclusion on Estonian Infrastructure Shutdown

In the 2007 shutdown of Estonia's infrastructure, there is a clear link between cybercrime and cyber warfare. For additional references on the RBN's political connections, see [The Age article](http://www.theage.com.au/news/security/the-hunt-for-russias-web-crims/2007/12/12/1197135470386.html).

### The Russian-Georgian War (August 2008)

The Russian-Georgian conflict in August 2008 presents a more complex scenario. Unlike the purely cyber-based Estonian conflict, this war involved kinetic operations synchronized with cyber attacks. The initial attack targeted the Georgian president's website using a simple yet effective DDoS method. The C&C servers used in this attack were taken offline as Russian troops crossed into Georgia.

### Subsequent Cyber Attacks

Shortly after the ground forces engaged, six new C&C servers began issuing DDoS commands targeting various Georgian websites. These servers were more capable and less dedicated to the Georgian attack, also engaging in "regular business" such as attacking pornographic, adult escort, carder forums, and gambling sites. This indicates that a cybercrime group managed these later C&C servers. The servers were registered through known bulletproof hosting providers in Russia, and the domains were hosted by entities with known links to cybercrime activities.

### Connection to Russian Government

The criminal activities, including forgery, money laundering, and botnet rentals for spamming and extortion, along with the Kremlin's policies and tactics, strongly suggest a connection between the Russian government and cybercrime. This connection enabled the deployment of one of the most synchronized kinetic-cyber attacks in history while allowing the Russian government to deny any direct involvement.

### Twitter, Google, and APTs

The incidents involving Twitter and Google in 2009 and 2010, attributed to Iran and China respectively, share similarities with traditional cybercrime methods. The Twitter attack, carried out by the "Iranian Cyber Army," a subgroup of the hacker group Ashiyane, involved stolen DNS credentials. Ashiyane had been training hackers and conducting both political and commercial cybercrimes. The operational duality of these groups, endorsed by governments, provides covert combat and financial benefits.

### Google and the Chinese Government

Google's experience with the Chinese government, similar to Twitter's, involved APTs. Although the term "APT" gained media attention in 2010, the concept has long been known in cybercrime research. The attack on Google, dubbed Aurora, targeted over 40 companies and exploited undisclosed vulnerabilities. While the attacks came from servers linked to China, the connection to the Chinese government cannot be ignored, especially given the political aims, such as infiltrating the mail accounts of Chinese human rights activists.

### Conclusion

The interconnection between cybercrime and cyber warfare, coupled with the covert nature of cyber operations, makes traditional combat methods inadequate. Future cyber warfare may resemble international espionage, involving partially trusted agents, dual-use technology, and operations in countries not directly involved. Current efforts to combat cybercrime could be useful against cyber warfare, and international cyber treaties, similar to the US-Russian nuclear arms treaty, may become necessary.
