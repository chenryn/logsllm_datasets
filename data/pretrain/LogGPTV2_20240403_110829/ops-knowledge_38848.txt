User: I use ubuntu 10.10, and I have both Python 2.x and Python 3.x. I have a program that needs to run with python 3.x (blender 2.5x).
How do I run a program with python 3.x?
Assistant: Blender is not run with or through Python at all. It's a native compiled executable and runs directly. It does however embed Python and use it as a scripting language. Blender 2.5 uses Python 3, and for this to work you need Python 3 installed on your system in the path, so blender can find it.
That's all, afaik.
