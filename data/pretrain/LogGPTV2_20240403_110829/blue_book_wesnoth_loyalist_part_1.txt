The [Loyalist](https://wiki.wesnoth.org/Loyalists) are a faction of
[Humans](https://wiki.wesnoth.org/Humans) who are loyal to the throne of
Wesnoth.
The race of men is an extremely diverse one. Although they originally came from
the Old Continent, men have spread all over the world and split into many
different cultures and races. Although they are not imbued with magic like other
creatures, humans can learn to wield it and able to learn more types than most
others. They have no extra special abilities or aptitudes except their
versatility and drive. While often at odds with all races, they can occasionally
form alliances with the less aggressive races such as elves and dwarves. The
less scrupulous among them do not shrink back from hiring orcish mercenaries,
either. They have no natural enemies, although the majority of men, like most
people of all races, have an instinctive dislike of the undead. Men are shorter
than the elves, but taller still than dwarves. Their skin color can vary, from
almost white to dark brown. Humans are a versatile race who specialize in many
different areas.
Similarly, the Loyalist faction is a very versatile melee oriented faction with
important ranged support from *bowmen* and *mages*.
# [How to play loyalists](https://wiki.wesnoth.org/How_to_play_Loyalists)
Loyalists are considered to be the most versatile faction in the game. They have
most available unit types to recruit (8), more than any other faction.
Loyalists are mostly melee oriented faction, with only two ranged unit types,
the *mage* and the *bowman*, but their ranged units play a significant role in the
loyalists strategy and have to be used effectively. About the melee troops the
loyalist player gets to choose among:
* *Heavy Infantrymen*: Few strikes, high damage per strike, slow, higher
    hit-points, good resistances, low defenses, deals impact damage which is good
    against undead.
* *Spearmen*: Average strikes, average damage per strike, average movement,
    medium hit-points, normal resistances, average defenses, deals pierce damage
    which is good against drakes, has a weak ranged attack.
* *Fencer*: High number of strikes, low damage per strike, quick, low hit-points,
    bad resistances, good defenses, deals blade damage which is good against
    elusive foots or wose, deals less total damage than the other two, is
    a skirmisher.
The loyalists unit price ranges from the cheap *spearmen* and *mermen* (14 gold) to
the expensive *horsemen* (23 gold).
Loyalist units generally have good hit-points and they deal good damage, even the
cheap *spearmen* and *bowmen*. Even their scouts have high hit-points and better
melee attack compared to most of the scouts of the other factions. But on the
other hand, the loyalist scouts have lower defenses than most of the other
scouts and they do not have a ranged attack.
The loyalists have some units with good resistances, like *Heavy Infantry* or
*Cavalryman*, which can be very good for defending if you notice that your
opponent doesn't have the proper units to counter them. Other units, like the
*bowman*, who is more vulnerable than the previous two, but is also good for
defense because it has better defense, is cheaper and it deals solid damage back
in both melee and range. Similar goes for the *spearman*.
**When attacking**, Loyalists have units which can be pretty devastating, like the
*horseman* for attacking enemy *mages* and other ranged units, *mages* against the
entrenched melee units, *fencers* for killing enemy injured and valuable units
trying to heal behind their lines. But the mentioned units are also very
vulnerable and they can die very easily if not properly supported.
The loyalists as a faction generally have average *defenses* (they do not get
70% defense anywhere, with the exception of the fencer, which is a special case)
and they are not a terrain dependent faction (like the Elves or Knalgans are).
Therefore, even if it good to put *spearmen* and *bowmen* on mountains, villages
and castles where they get 60% defense, you should also take the faction you are
facing into account when deciding where to place your units. For example, if you
are fighting Knalgans, you should try not to move your units next to hills and
mountains and/or take the hills and mountains with your units and leave the
forest to the dwarves.
All the loyalist units are lawful, which obviously leads to the conclusion that
the loyalists should be more aggressive and attack at day (or even start at
dawn, because your opponent in most of the cases will be reluctant to attack too
aggressively and leave units on bad ground when the morning arrives) while at
night the loyalists should at least play conservatively, or in some cases even
run away. Of course, that is also dependent upon the faction of your opponent.
**The greatest weakness** of the loyalists is their limited mobility. The
loyalists' units have normal movement, some of their units like the
*horseman*, *cavalryman*, *merman fighter* and the *fencer* are pretty quick
when they are in their favorable environment, but all their units get slowed
over rough terrain a lot compared to the other factions' units . Half of the
loyalists units can not even move on/over mountains, and their scouts get
significantly slowed in forest, for example. This lack of mobility will often
give your opponent an opportunity to outmaneuver you in the game.To prevent
that, sometimes it is good to attack hard on a certain point and defend only
with minimal amount of units elsewhere, rather than uniformly spreading your
units around the front.
When you don't know which faction you are facing, it is good to get a mixture
of units. On most of the default 1v1 maps, this initial recruitment list would
be good : *spearman*, *bowman*, *fencer*, *mage*, *merman fighter*,
*cavalryman*. As always, you should carefully consider about the exact placement
of each individual unit from the initial recruits on the castle to come up with
the most optimal combination that will allow you the quickest village grabbing
in the first turns of the game.
## [Loyalists vs. Undead](https://wiki.wesnoth.org/How_to_play_Loyalists#Loyalists_vs._Undead)
When fighting undead, your recruiting pattern will depend on whether your
opponent spams **skeleton archers** or *dark adepts* for ranged attacks. If you see
lots of skeletons, you'll have to focus heavily on *heavy infrantrymen* and
*mages*. If you see lots of *dark adepts*, you'll want some *cavalry*,
*horsemen* and maybe some *spearmen*.
* *Bowman*: (**D-**) Almost entirely useless. You might use them to poke at
    *walking corpses*, *ghouls*, *vampire bats* and *ghosts*, but *mages* are
    much better at all of these things. I would only buy a *bowman* to counter
    a large zombie horde.
* *Cavalryman*: (**B+**) You'll want some *cavalry* for scouting and dealing
    initial damage to *dark adepts* so that a *horseman* can finish them. They
    are also decent at fighting Skeletons in the daytime, because *cavalry* are
    blade-resistant. However, the cheap *skeleton archers* will really ruin
    *cavalry* quickly at night, so if there are any *skeleton archers* on the other
    side you won't be able to use *cavalry* to hold territory. If your opponent
    over-recruits *dark adepts*, however, you can use cold-resistant *cavalry* to hold
    territory against them. They are also decent for holding territory against
    *ghouls* because they can run away and heal (unlike your *heavy infantrymen*).
* *Fencer*: (**C-**) Fencers are a bad recruit in this match up because they are
    vulnerable to the blade and pierce damage of skeletons and cannot damage
    them much in return. They also are incapable of holding territory against
    *dark adepts*, who cut right through the high defense of *fencers*. However,
    you may want to have a *fencer* or two around for trapping *dark adepts* or
    getting in that last hit. With luck, they may also be able to frustrate
    non-magical attacks from skeletons and the like.
* *Heavy Infantryman*: (**B+**) You need *heavy infantry* to hold territory
    against *skeletons* and *skeleton archers*, and they will be your unit of
    choice for dealing melee damage, especially to the cheap *skeleton archers*.
    Any *heavy infantrymen* in the daytime can kill a full health skeleton
    archer in two hits, while a strong *heavy infantrymen* in the daytime can
    kill a full health skeleton in two hits, dealing 18 damage per strike (even
    a *mage* in daytime cannot kill a skeleton in one round, unless supported by
    a *lieutenant*). A fearless *heavy infantryman* may be dangerous even at
    night. If you don't have enough *heavy infantryman* to go around, you can
    get your initial hits in on a *skeleton archer* with them and finish him
    with a *mage*. Just keep *heavy infantrymen* away from *dark adepts*, and
    only let *ghouls* hit *heavy infantrymen* if they are on a village (or has
    a *white mage* or other healer next to him), since they can't easily run
    away to heal. Also beware *walking corpses*, which deal a surprising amount
    of damage at all times of day since *heavy infantrymen* can't dodge and
    impact damage goes around their resistances, and the ranged cold attack of
    *ghosts*. The biggest problem with *heavy infantrymen* is they are slow,
    which means they're hard to retreat at night and hard to advance in day.
    Without shielding units they'll get trapped and killed, and if you have to
    shield a unit maybe it should be a *mage* instead.
* *Horseman*: (**B**) - Because they deal pierce damage, *horsemen* may not be
    very useful when faced with *skeletons*. However, if your opponent
    over-recruits *dark adepts*, *horsemen* can be extremely useful, as *dark
    adepts* deal no return damage to the normally risky charge attack.
    *horsemen* can even be used to finish *skeleton archers*, their nemesis, in
    the daytime. However, if your opponent recruits enough *skeleton archers*
    you will have a hard time shielding your *horsemen* from their devastating
    pierce attacks, and *skeleton archers* are dirt cheap. *horsemen* can also
    one-shot *bats* and *zombies*, which can be useful if you need to clear out
    a lot of level 0 units quickly. I would want to have at least one *horseman*
    around to keep my opponent from getting too bold with *dark adepts*, if not
    more. Your opponent will be forced to recruit *dark adepts* if you have
    *heavy infantrymen* in the field.
* *Mage*: (**A+**) *mages* are an absolute necessity against Undead. If you do
    not have *mages* it will be almost impossible for you to kill *ghosts*, but
    with *mages* it's a piece of cake. *mages* are the best unit for killing
    almost everything Undead can throw at you, and can even be used to finish
    *dark adepts* in the daytime. Your main problem is that *dark adepts* are
    cheaper and deal almost as much damage, so your opponent can spam *dark
    adepts* while you cannot afford to spam *mages*. You will also have the
    difficult task of shielding fragile, expensive *mages* against lots of cheap
    Undead units. Your opponent will use *skeletons* and *ghouls* to attack your
    *mages* when he can, but *bats*, *zombies* or just about any other unit will
    do for killing your *mages* in a pinch. Shield your *mages* well, surround
    them with damage soakers and if you can deliver them safely to their targets
    you'll be able to clear out the Undead quickly.
* *Merman Fighter*: (**C-**) Mermen make a decent navy against Undead, since
    *bats* and *ghosts* will have a hard time killing them with their high
    defense. Even *dark adepts* will find Mermen annoying because of their 20%
    cold resistance. However, Mermen will have a hard time hurting anything the
    Undead have with their lame pierce weapon. Generally Mermen are only good
    for holding water hexes and scouting, but don't underestimate how useful
    that can be. Some well-placed Mermen on a water map can prevent *bats* from
    sneaking behind your lines and capturing villages or killing injured units.
    Even on mostly land maps, a Merman in a river can help hold a defensive
    line, or a quick Merman can use a river to slip behind the enemy to trap
    *dark adepts* or other units that are trying to escape at daytime.
* *Spearman*: (**C-**) *Spearmen* are mostly useful as cheap units for holding
    villages and occupying space when faced with *dark adepts* or *skeleton
    archers*. (You'll want to avoid letting *dark adepts* hit your *heavy
