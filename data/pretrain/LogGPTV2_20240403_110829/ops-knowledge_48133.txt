To effectively implement CIS Control 13.7, which involves deploying a host-based intrusion prevention solution, an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Assessment and Planning:**
   - Conduct a thorough assessment of the organization's current security posture to identify critical assets that require protection.
   - Evaluate the compatibility and support for host-based intrusion prevention solutions (HIPS) on the existing infrastructure.
   - Develop a detailed implementation plan, including timelines, resource allocation, and potential challenges.

2. **Solution Selection:**
   - Research and select a suitable host-based intrusion prevention solution. Common examples include Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) clients or HIPS agents.
   - Ensure that the chosen solution aligns with the organization’s specific security requirements and can be integrated into the existing security architecture.

3. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the selected HIPS solution on all identified enterprise assets, such as servers, workstations, and other critical devices.
   - Follow best practices and vendor guidelines for installation and configuration to ensure optimal performance and minimal disruption.

4. **Configuration and Tuning:**
   - Configure the HIPS solution according to the organization’s security policies and threat landscape.
   - Implement and fine-tune detection and prevention rules to minimize false positives and maximize the effectiveness of the solution.
   - Regularly update the HIPS solution with the latest threat intelligence and security patches.

5. **Monitoring and Maintenance:**
   - Continuously monitor the HIPS solution for any suspicious activities or potential breaches.
   - Establish a process for regular review and analysis of logs and alerts to detect and respond to threats promptly.
   - Perform periodic reviews and audits of the HIPS solution to ensure it remains effective and up-to-date.

6. **Training and Awareness:**
   - Provide training to IT staff and end-users on the importance of the HIPS solution and how to use it effectively.
   - Promote a culture of security awareness within the organization to enhance overall cybersecurity posture.

CIS Control 13.7 focuses on the asset type "Devices" and serves the security function of "Protect." By following these procedures, an organization can significantly enhance its ability to prevent, detect, and respond to intrusions at the host level.
