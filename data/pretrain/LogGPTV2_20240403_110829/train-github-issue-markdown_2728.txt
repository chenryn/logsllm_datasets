To address the issue and improve the clarity of your code, I will provide a revised version that includes error handling and comments. Additionally, I'll explain the steps to resolve the `FileNotFoundError` you encountered.

### Revised Code

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example data
t = np.arange(0.0, 1.0 + 0.01, 0.01)
s = np.cos(4 * np.pi * t) + 2

# Enable LaTeX rendering for text
plt.rc('text', usetex=True)
plt.rc('font', family='serif')

# Plot the data
plt.plot(t, s)

# Set labels and title
plt.xlabel(r'\textbf{time} (s)')
plt.ylabel(r'\textit{voltage} (mV)', fontsize=16)
plt.title(r"\TeX\ is Number "
          r"$\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{-e^{i\pi}}{2^n}$!",
          fontsize=16, color='gray')

# Adjust subplot parameters to make room for the large title
plt.subplots_adjust(top=0.8)

# Save the figure
try:
    plt.savefig('tex_demo.png')
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
    print("Ensure that the necessary LaTeX packages are installed and accessible.")

# Display the plot
plt.show()
```

### Explanation and Troubleshooting

The `FileNotFoundError` you encountered is typically due to missing or inaccessible LaTeX-related tools. Here are some steps to resolve this issue:

1. **Install LaTeX Distribution**:
   - Ensure that you have a LaTeX distribution installed on your system. For Windows, you can use MiKTeX or TeX Live.
   - Install MiKTeX from [here](https://miktex.org/download).
   - Install TeX Live from [here](https://www.tug.org/texlive/).

2. **Add LaTeX to System Path**:
   - After installing MiKTeX or TeX Live, add the path to the LaTeX binaries to your system's PATH environment variable.
   - For MiKTeX, the typical path is `C:\Program Files\MiKTeX 2.9\miktex\bin\x64`.
   - For TeX Live, the typical path is `C:\texlive\2023\bin\win32` (adjust the year and architecture as needed).

3. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open a command prompt and type `pdflatex --version` to check if the LaTeX compiler is correctly installed and accessible.

4. **Check Matplotlib Configuration**:
   - Ensure that Matplotlib is configured to use the correct LaTeX backend. You can check and modify the configuration file (`matplotlibrc`) located in your Matplotlib installation directory or user directory.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `FileNotFoundError` and successfully generate the plot with LaTeX-rendered text.
