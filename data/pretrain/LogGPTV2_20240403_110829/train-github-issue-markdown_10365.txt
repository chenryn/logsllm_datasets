Had started on a page that references this page. Have filed an issue against
the parent but part of its resolution involves fixing this page too:
#21631
The page:
http://kubernetes.io/v1.1/examples/https-nginx/README.html
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.1/examples/https-
nginx/README.md
Provides instructions on generating a secret. It was not immediately obvious
from this page (I linked directly to it to a 1. Download/build the code, 2.
You should have a "make" command....) that there's an assumption that the
reader will have downloaded Kubernetes/examples sources. The make command
obviously won't work as the correct "make" command won't exist:
make keys secret KEY=/tmp/nginx.key CERT=/tmp/nginx.crt
SECRET=/tmp/secret.json
After attempting and failing to download/build the sources, I believe that
this script no longer works:  
#14558
Ironically, I found generate-secrets-from-file on the following page and,
through grokking this and the make_secret.go file, I was able to muddle
through and create a secret.json file for Kubernetes.

Recommend:
Add documentation that explicitly documents (separately) how to generate a
Kuberenetes secret from self-signed certificates.
Please add (if there's not already) an easier way to submit bugs against
kubernetes.io by helping the reader reference the github source directly. I
googled for duplicates to find the correct github page.
