User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题is there a safe way to login to my gmail account from a public pc? Sometimes i need to use a public pc to access my gmail account, is there a safe way to login and keep my password safe in case there was a keylogger or a trojan on that pc? are there tools that could help in that case?

Assistant: Enable two factor authentication.  Consider the remembered password compromised to any user of the public computer.

EDIT: My answer dealt with how to prevent your password from being keylogged.  With two-factor authentication your password is now the combination of a randomly generated one-time use code (obtained via cell phone or pre-obtained list) as well as the remembered password; hence a keylogger doesn't give an attacker the ability to log in as you for a future attack.

However, I definitely agree with TomLeek and Nic that in a real-time attack (not a keylogger looked at after the fact) that captures your random session token (that indicates to gmail you are signed in before you do any action), an attacker can fully use your gmail account (send emails as you; search through emails sent to you; delete your emails; etc).  Granted, once you logout your session token will become invalidated and will kick them out of your account.  Granted a clever attacker could write a browser plugin to collect your session tokens, send it to them, and then redirect the logout page to not actually invalidate your token.  Though you could always login to gmail again, view the link for "Last account activity [Details]" and sign everyone else out.
