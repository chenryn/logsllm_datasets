User: I installed Anaconda a while ago but recently decided to uninstall it and just install basic python 2.7.
I removed Anaconda and deleted all the directories and installed python 2.7.
But when I go to install PyGTK for Windows it says it will install it to the c:/users/.../Anaconda directory - this doesn't even exist. I want to install it to the c:/python-2.7 directory. Why does it think Anaconda is still installed? And how can I change this?
Assistant: Method1:
To uninstall Anaconda3 go to the Anaconda3 folder, there u will be able to find an executable called Uninstall-Anaconda3.exe, double click on it. This should uninstall ur application.
There are times when the shortcut of anaconda command prompt,jupyter notebook, spyder, etc exists, so delete those files too. 
Method2 (Windows8):
Go to control panel->Programs->Uninstall a Program and then select Anaconda3(Python3.1. 64-bit)in the menu.
