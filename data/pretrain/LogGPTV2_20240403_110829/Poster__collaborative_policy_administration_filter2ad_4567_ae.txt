revive the local community4, citizen-run platforms 
to crowd-source new legislation ideas5 and projects 
to reinvent more collective ways or growing old 
together6 .
These developments have been especially visible 
in urban areas, such as Helsinki7. Some of those 
developments are connected to the renewed interest 
in the spirit of traditional Finnish talkoot8, as well as to 
the combination of creative and information-sharing 
associational activity as a sort of activist instrument 
(Paterson 2011). In many cases, self-assigned 
innovators and active people have decided to take a 
more active role in confronting contemporary concerns, 
strengthening their belonging and cooperation 
with others and at the same time redefining what is 
considered as “public”, “collaborative” and even “shared” 
in their cities. There is no doubt that the Internet 
has been a supporting factor in the visibility of these 
efforts when, at least in the Finnish context, broadband 
and mobile connection are reasonably available9 
and where social media platforms, both mainstream 
as well as other more niche ones have been 
enthusiastically appropriated. New media and new 
technologies have indeed provided some groups with 
easy ways to communicate, forming online groups and 
self-defined information channels and collaborative 
spaces. Many of the experiences in projects and case 
studies of the SIG members are definitively examples 
of this trend.

evolving impacts of the economic crisis, shifting 
demands for the Nordic model of the welfare state10,

 A reinvigoration of the neighborhood association model in the 
form of “movements” has been visible in Helsinki over the last years. 
Networks are sprouting in the suburbs (e.g: ) as well as in the city 
center  (e.g: http://kallioliike.org/)
 Called the Avoin Ministeriö (Open Ministry). The experiment is 
run by an association that provides an online platform (http://
openministry.info/).
 An association of self-defined “active citizens” is working now in its 
second project to design and build a co-housing arrangement. See

Helsinki
 Talkoot is a Finnish expression for a gathering of people (friends, 
family, neighbors) to work together building or repairing something 
that is of common concern or to help someone with a task that 
exceeds his or her own capacity. The work is unpaid and involves 
elements of festive and party attitude (see also: http://en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/Talkoot) 
 Statistics Finland tells that more than 70% of Finnish population 
uses internet daily as of 2011 (see http://www.stat.fi/til/

and the challenges of an aging population have 
been raised as key points to deal with in many 
political discussions in the country. To support that 
conversation with more collaborative dynamics some 
initiatives have been made. The Finnish Innovation 
Fund (Sitra) has commissioned several reports that 
deal with alternative approaches to deal with these 
challenges. One features ideas on the future of the 
welfare state in the time of communities (Mokka & 
Neuvonen 2006), and a more recent one provides 
an overview of contemporary Finnish co-production 
projects that build on the "talkoot" tradition 
(Aitamurto, Siivonen & Lovio 2012). In parallel few 
discrete initiatives to bring new perspective to 
innovation approaches in the public sector have been 
tried. Again a design-oriented unit in Sitra known as 
the Helsinki Design Lab, has placed designers in public 
departments11 and created also provocative prototypes 
like that of a “public” crowd-funding platform for civic 
spaces12. Other initiatives include experiments on

new projects to consolidate open data offerings of 
public organizations so that new services can be 
created14 and also few initiatives where innovation 
environments in which citizens are supposed to have a 
role in the process have been tested15.
From a different perspective our own Aalto University 
has also been involved in experimenting with new 
service design approaches involving both citizens 
and municipalities that are starting to yield some 
interesting results [See Box 1]. 
All these developments set the ground for a more 
general debate on how our relationship with the 
state should evolve, and how to imagine and organize

common affairs in new ways16. There is no doubt that 
there is a renewed interest to understand processes, 
logics and incentives that can make possible new 
partnerships between the public-sector, private-
sector, third-sector, and citizens, in order to create, 
produce and deliver public services17.  In accordance to 
DESIS idea of the Lab, we believe such experimental 
spaces might create conditions to probe, prototype 
and engage actively with citizens in understanding 
these new dynamics, however the path towards is 
long and not straightforward. For us it seems that the 
collaborative and communal dimensions of public

services have not surface enough as the focus of 
discussion and action in Finland, despite that there are 
several experimentations currently underway as we 
have highlighted.  
The possibilities for both grassroots level (supported  
by design labs) and official level experiments (carried 
out with design labs) to make an impact will largely 
depend on how new initiatives are able to work with-
in several emerging key themes. 
3.  THEMES
In the following we propose some of these themes 
and the underlying issues they present fro public and 
collaborative services. These insights are based largely

on the discussions that arose while working on the 
co-p2 SIG initiative, and on our own design experience. 
That is by looking back at our ongoing research across 
old and new projects. We present these themes, as a 
challenge to design’s involvement in the renewal of 
public services and also as opportunities to embrace a 
more rigorous practice.
3.1 The increased importance of the dynamics of co-
production and peer-production
The inclusion of design oriented approaches in the 
development of public services have had some impact 
in acknowledging the importance of involving citizens 
in early stages of service ideation (Bason 2013 this 
compilation). There is by now a more consolidated 
set of tools and techniques aimed at enhancing

citizens influence in early stages all the away from 
crowd-sourcing their ideas, to seeking consultation 
and engaging citizens in iterative ideation workshops. 
However, citizen-driven grassroots efforts like the ones 
we have pointed out in the previous section also point 
to the fact that beyond early involvement in ideation, 
other not so straightforward long-term involvement 
goals are gaining relevance. In that framework more 
attention needs to be geared towards supporting 
and making possible -also by design- the dynamics 
of co-production and peer-production. Co-production 
broadly speaking can be seen as the possibility to 
continue one’s creative and practical involvement in 
the production and delivery of the service throughout 
time. Peer-production on the other hand involves 
also the capability of self organizing to make services 
happen between peers at points and contexts where it 
makes sense to do so.
5
During the work of the SIG we had the opportunity to 
learn more about a couple of services developed by a 
NGO aimed at a particular set of "problematic" users: 
drug and gambling addicts. In their case, the design 
and use of web and mobile -based tools have enabled 
new types of peer-based support services for dealing 
with addiction (Tammi et al 2012). The services 
have proven to be successful in both cases, thus 
highlighting the many benefits and the reach of jointly 
co-producing a service where the (publicly funded) 
NGO maintains the platform and host the interactions, 
but where “users” are producing the content (advice 
and support). The experience makes clear also the 
dangers of taking the approach too naively, without 
considerations to the particularities of situations of 
use, and structural conditions that surrounds these 
people. There will be always a need for —and also 
the right to— professional support, beyond that of the 
one provided by peers. The future evolution of the 
services and the platform it relies on might need a 
more thorough rethinking of different balances, and 
meanings in co-production.
Another interesting case relied on the experiences 
of the local chapter of time banking in Helsinki 
(van der Wekken 2012), which the activists see as 
a viable platform for the development of local and 
community services. In their case it is not only a matter 
of supplying services that are currently unavailable 
(not offered by the municipalities), rather it is more an 
attempt to rethink and reframe economical exchange 
activities and provide opportunities for influencing 
and engaging in new forms of organization. The 
building blocks needed for a successful design in 
these conditions are not always in the control of 
the community itself nor is it necessarily possible to 
articulate what would be needed  “before” the ideas are 
tried out in practice. In here several “designs” need to 
be experimented, tried out and piloted 
in 
practice as they all go along. 
Public and collaborative 
service design approaches 
need to account for 
this more seriously by 
addressing collaborative 
design dynamics beyond 
the traditional design 
phases, also in the phases of 
use, future use and design 
“while doing”.
3.2 An issue of co-governance (democracy)
Having citizens involved in the co-production of 
services has been often presented as valid insofar it 
offers economical solutions. Often, having groups of 
volunteer citizens take care of some of the activities 
cuts the expenses traditionally paid to third parties 
or to the staff of municipalities and public service 
providers. Additionally, from the side of citizens, the 
incentive for volunteer work can be high, because 
the issues at stake touch their everyday lives, their 
possibilities of enjoyment of their surroundings and 
pressing needs. For example, Pirjo Tulikukka shared 
the case of the Kääntöpaikka community space in the 
neighborhood of Arabianranta. There was a pressing 
need for such a space in this new neighborhood, which 
had not been catered for by the urban development. 
A group of residents began to pro-actively look for 
As co-production and peer-
production of public services 
become a reality to confront, 
design activities need to 
also address involvement in 
the maintenance, relocation, 
redirection and evolution of 
services. As we have seen, the 
involvement of a wide variety 
of people in these activities has 
implications beyond productivity, 
efficiency, or experience.
suitable spaces, found a suitable empty office space, 
and proposed the idea to the development agency, 
which accepted it. The residents group then created 
two teams to voluntarily manage this communal 
space (Tulikukka 2012). For many of them, this became 
a much more meaningful way to be involved and 
participate, than for example voting in the local 
elections. As the community activities began to grow, 
the group of residents applied for funds from the 
Social Department of the City of Helsinki to cover the 
salary of a person to handle the work. A small victory 
they won and provided further incentives to continue. 
This is one example of how citizens and officials - 
together- found solutions, “on the go”, for local pressing 
issues.
Cutting expenses and addressing the pressing needs 
of citizens are concrete aspects of co-production 
and p2p production. However, these practices could 
provide stepping stones for addressing new forms of 
democratic practices and models. Traditional citizen 
participation, which has mainly been limited to 
inviting citizens to give feedback on issues highlighted 
by officials, has so far failed because it happens from 
the “inside-out”, so from the side of formal governance, 
which reaches out to citizens. Many of the everyday 
issues have thus remained untackled (Boeher & 
Boelens, 2011).
Victor Pestoff (2012) argues that co-production 
has important implications for the development of 
participatory forms of governance, and the important 
role public policy plays in crowding in or out these 
developments. Additionally, Michel Bauwens (2012) 
envisions a change in the role of the state. According 
to him, the peer-to-peer economy opens the way for a 
“partner state”, with whom citizens collaborates in the 
production of services. According to these writers, co-
production and peer production of services can thus be 
understood as being key ingredients of new forms of 
governance, such as co-governance, where government 
and citizens cooperate and co-produce and maybe 
where there is an interest to build a commons (Bollier 
& Hellfrich 2012). What does that then means for the 
design of public services and for service designers? 
There is a need for design to step out of its own 
disciplinary silo and jargon, and to clearly position 
itself in the context of governance and fully address 
“the political” (see also Hillgren 2013 and Staszowski 
2013 this compilation). So far, as designers, we have 
little language that would help us collaborate, and 
debate with e.g. policy experts. Such language needs 
to be developed.
3.3 Recognizing design-in-use as a central design activity
So far we have highlighted the importance of 
identifying co-production and peer production 
dynamics that tell us it is not enough to focus only 
on citizen involvement in the initial design stages, 
nor even with coming up with new services ideas. As 
co-production and peer-production of public services 
become a reality to confront, design activities need
