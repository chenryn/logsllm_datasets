### Cleaning Day and Community Revitalization

On Cleaning Day, cities transform into flea markets, where residents can sell or give away their unwanted items. This event not only declutters homes but also revitalizes local communities. For more information, visit [http://siivouspaiva.com/](http://siivouspaiva.com/).

### Citizen-Driven Initiatives

Several citizen-driven platforms have emerged to crowdsource new legislative ideas and projects. One such platform is the Open Ministry (Avoin Ministeriö), which provides an online space for proposing and discussing new laws. Another initiative involves designing and building co-housing arrangements, particularly for seniors, promoting a more collective way of aging together. These developments are especially visible in urban areas like Helsinki.

### Renewed Interest in Finnish Traditions

These initiatives often draw on the spirit of traditional Finnish "talkoot," which are community gatherings where people work together on a common task, often with a festive and social atmosphere. The combination of creative and information-sharing activities has also become a form of activism, as seen in Paterson's (2011) work. Self-appointed innovators and active citizens are taking a more proactive role in addressing contemporary issues, fostering a sense of belonging and cooperation, and redefining what it means to be "public," "collaborative," and "shared" in their cities.

### Role of the Internet

The internet has played a crucial role in the visibility and success of these efforts. In Finland, broadband and mobile connections are widely available, and social media platforms, both mainstream and niche, have been enthusiastically adopted. New media and technologies have facilitated communication, enabling the formation of online groups, self-defined information channels, and collaborative spaces. Many of the experiences and case studies from the SIG members exemplify this trend.

### Local Trends and Economic Context

In parallel with these local trends, the evolving impacts of the economic crisis and shifting demands for the Nordic welfare state model have raised key challenges, such as an aging population. To address these, initiatives like the Finnish Innovation Fund (Sitra) have commissioned reports on alternative approaches. For example, one report explores the future of the welfare state in the context of communities (Mokka & Neuvonen 2006), while another examines contemporary Finnish co-production projects (Aitamurto, Siivonen & Lovio 2012).

### Public Sector Innovations

Efforts to bring new perspectives to public sector innovation include the Design Exchange program by Sitra, which places designers in public departments, and the Brickstarter prototype, a crowdfunding platform for civic spaces. Other initiatives include participatory budgeting by the City Library network, open data projects like the Helsinki Region Infoshare, and experiments like the Joukkoenkeli platform in Espoo.

### Aalto University's Contributions

Aalto University has also been involved in experimenting with new service design approaches that involve both citizens and municipalities, yielding interesting results. These developments set the stage for a broader debate on the evolving relationship between citizens and the state, and how to organize common affairs in new ways. There is a renewed interest in understanding the processes, logics, and incentives that can facilitate new partnerships between the public, private, and third sectors, and citizens, to create, produce, and deliver public services.

### Themes for Public and Collaborative Services

#### 3.1 Co-Production and Peer-Production Dynamics

Design-oriented approaches in public service development have highlighted the importance of involving citizens in early stages of service ideation. Tools and techniques now exist to enhance citizen influence, from crowdsourcing ideas to iterative ideation workshops. However, beyond initial involvement, there is a need to support long-term co-production and peer-production. For example, web and mobile-based tools have enabled new types of peer-based support services for drug and gambling addicts, demonstrating the benefits and reach of co-producing services where users generate content.

#### 3.2 Co-Governance and Democracy

Citizen involvement in co-production is often justified economically, as volunteer work can reduce costs. However, it also offers a more meaningful way for citizens to participate in their communities. For instance, the Kääntöpaikka community space in Arabianranta was initiated and managed by residents, who found a more engaging way to contribute than voting in local elections. Co-production and peer production can also lead to new forms of democratic governance, where government and citizens collaborate and co-produce services. Designers need to step out of their disciplinary silos and develop a language to collaborate with policy experts.

#### 3.3 Design-in-Use as a Central Activity

It is not enough to focus only on citizen involvement in the initial design stages; design activities must also address the maintenance, relocation, redirection, and evolution of services. As co-production and peer production of public services become more prevalent, design must account for the ongoing use and adaptation of services. This involves recognizing design-in-use as a central activity, ensuring that a wide variety of people can participate in the continuous improvement and evolution of services.

### Conclusion

The collaborative and communal dimensions of public services are gaining prominence in Finland, with numerous experiments and initiatives underway. The success of these efforts will depend on how new initiatives can address emerging themes such as co-production, co-governance, and design-in-use. By embracing these themes, designers and policymakers can create more inclusive, efficient, and sustainable public services.
