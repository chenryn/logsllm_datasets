User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题CentOS NFS server session crashes I recently received some alerts that 2 of my backups failed to an NFS mount in my environment. After reviewing the logs I realized that the software was unable to establish a connection to the NFS mount in order to verify enough storage was availabe to run the job. I ssh'd into the box from the server that was experiencing the issue, thus verifying connectivity to the remote destination, and after reviewing df -h to find that there was plenty of storage, I then decided to "browse" that storage, and this is when my sessions continuously crash. Everytime I try to browse the /home/export/ path, the TTY session freezes and I have to establish a new session. Has anyone seen this? I'd tell you the version of CentOS that i'm running and some other versioning info, but I just rebooted the NFS mount and can't login at the moment.

Assistant: Kill any NFS server daemons on the server, and any nfs-related processes on the client, and restart on both ends. In my years of working as a sysadmin, I've seen NFS freeze time and time again. It's one of the frustrating/unstable things about it.
