Start the Apache server, open the configuration file httpd.conf, and search for the following content: #LoadModule php7_module modules/libphp7.so Uncomment it and change it to the following content: LoadModule php7_module modules/libphp7.so If you are not using PHP7, then The module name needs to be changed accordingly. 3. Locate the following snippet in the httpd.conf file: <Directory /> AllowOverride none Require all denied </Directory> Change to: <Directory /> AllowOverride none Require all granted </Directory> This will allow the Apache server to handle All files in the directory. 4. Find the following code snippet in the httpd.conf file: <IfModule dir_module> DirectoryIndex index.html </IfModule> Change to: <IfModule dir_module> DirectoryIndex index.php index.html </IfModule> This will allow the Apache server to directly access index.php file instead of the default index.html file. 5. Restart the Apache server. 6. Create a test.php file in the web directory, and add the following content: <?php phpinfo(); ?> 7. Enter http://localhost/test.php in the browser, and check whether PHP is successfully installed and PHP configuration information. You have now successfully configured your Apache server to serve PHP web applications.
