User:  company's database needs performance optimization, please provide a plan, including database structure design, SQL optimization and other aspects.
Assistant: Database structure design: 1. Design an appropriate data model, store data in related tables, and the relationship between tables is good. 2. Consider using partition tables to partition large amounts of data and store them on different physical devices to improve query efficiency. 3. For complex query and data analysis needs, use data warehouse technology to integrate and summarize raw data to improve query speed and analysis efficiency. SQL optimization: 1. Avoid using LIKE as much as possible, because the search process of LIKE is linear, which will lead to performance degradation. 2. Avoid using subqueries, you can use temporary tables or connections (JOIN) instead. 3. Avoid using SELECT *, and only query the required fields to reduce the transmission of redundant data. 4. Use indexes to speed up queries, and reasonably design the location and type of indexes. 5. If improperly designed, the database may cause problems such as table locks and row locks. At this time, distributed databases can be used to improve parallel performance. 6. Avoid frequent execution of DDL operations, including table structure modification and index modification, and you need to consider the corresponding room for planning and preparation. 7. Regularly clear unused data, especially large files. After clearing, the disk usage rate can be reduced and the performance of read and write operations can be improved. 8. Regularly optimize the database and select appropriate data management software, such as PT-Tools and Mytop, etc., which can effectively improve memory usage and disk IO performance.
