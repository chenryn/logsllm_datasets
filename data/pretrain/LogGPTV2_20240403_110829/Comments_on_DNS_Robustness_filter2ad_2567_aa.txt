## Abstract
The Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-readable domain names into the network addresses required for communication. The robustness of the DNS is essential for the overall operation of the Internet. The DNS protocol and architecture were designed to support structural robustness, such as allowing domains to rely on authoritative nameservers in multiple, geographically diverse data centers. However, the actual implementation may not always utilize these robustness features. This paper provides an initial analysis of the structural robustness of the DNS ecosystem over the past nine years.

## 1 Introduction
The Domain Name System (DNS) maps human-friendly hostnames into network layer addresses, making it a critical component of the Internet's infrastructure. The robustness of the DNS is therefore of paramount importance. This paper provides an initial assessment of various robustness properties of the modern DNS ecosystem.

The DNS is a hierarchical and distributed system, allowing for the delegation of portions of the namespace to specific authoritative nameservers. This delegation supports both flexibility and robustness:

- **Flexibility:** Delegation allows name owners to configure the name resolution process according to their needs, enabling dynamic bindings, traffic management in content distribution networks, outsourcing DNS services, and controlling caching via time-to-live settings.
- **Robustness:** Delegating parts of the namespace to multiple nameservers ensures that any issues affect only a small portion of the system. Additionally, using multiple replica nameservers allows the system to function even if one replica becomes unavailable.

While the DNS was designed with robustness in mind, achieving it requires careful configuration and operation. For example, while the use of multiple nameservers can avoid single points of failure, some operators may still rely on a single nameserver, negating the intended robustness.

One approach to enhancing robustness is to outsource DNS operations to specialized providers. These providers have the expertise and resources, such as geographically diverse data centers, to ensure robustness. However, this can also lead to concentration, as seen in the 2016 DDoS attack on Dyn, which affected many organizations relying on its DNS infrastructure.

This paper focuses on the robustness of second-level domains (SLDs). At this level, the number of named replicas is generally smaller, and individual decisions by organizations can impact robustness. Our study uses a longitudinal dataset from 2009 to 2018 to understand how SLD robustness has evolved over time.

## 2 Related Work
Previous studies have examined the connectedness of the DNS nameserver ecosystem, which is a key aspect of robustness. One study used data from July 2004 to analyze the "trusted computing base" (TCB) for nearly 600,000 names, highlighting the broad dependency in the system. Another study in June 2007 investigated the degree of shared web server infrastructure and included a preliminary analysis of shared DNS infrastructure.

Our work complements these studies by using a more recent and longitudinal dataset to update our understanding and examine the evolution of DNS robustness over time. We focus on the robustness of popular SLDs, which are critical for large numbers of users.

## 3 Data and Methodology

### 3.1 Data
**Dataset A: Alexa Popularity Lists**
We focus on popular SLDs, as they are crucial for large numbers of users. We use Alexa’s list of the top 1 million most popular sites, collected regularly since 2009. We analyze the .com, .net, and .org zones, which together constitute at least 56% of the Alexa list each month. The contribution of these TLDs has been decreasing over time, but they still represent a significant portion of the list.

**Dataset Z: TLD Zone Files**
We use daily snapshots of the .com, .net, and .org zone files since April 2009. For each month, we use the first snapshot that correctly incorporates all three zones.

### 3.2 Methodology
Our methodology involves three main steps:

1. **Zone File Parsing:** We parse the zone files to extract NS records for each SLD.
2. **Resolution:** We resolve the NS records to IP addresses, categorizing SLDs as fully resolved, partially resolved, or unresolved.
3. **Topological Determination:** We determine the topological location of authoritative servers, using /24 address blocks to delineate networks. We refine this with traceroute measurements for the last month of our analysis.

Understanding the modern DNS structure is complicated by the use of anycast, where large DNS providers direct requests to nearby replicas. Future work will include better historical routing information to refine our analyses.
