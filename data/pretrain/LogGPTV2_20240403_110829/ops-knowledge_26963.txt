User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk is related to the StackScrollAlgorithm and WindowManager software components. It appears to be tracking the overlap of notifications and the change in focus, as well as the visibility of the PhoneStatusBar. The log shows that the overlapAmount, previousNotificationEnd, newYTranslation, location, getTopPadding, and getLocationOnScreen() values are being updated, as well as the clipTopAmount and vis values. The log also shows that the setLightsOn() and cancelAutohide functions are being called.
