**ATT&CK ID:** T1055  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Process Injection

Adversaries may use process injection to execute arbitrary code within the address space of a legitimate, running process. This technique allows them to evade process-based defenses and potentially elevate their privileges. By injecting code into another process, attackers can gain access to the target process's memory, system resources, and network resources. Additionally, this method may enable them to operate with elevated privileges.

Process injection is particularly effective for evading detection by security products because the malicious activity is hidden within the context of a legitimate process. As a result, the execution of the injected code may go unnoticed by traditional security measures, making it a powerful tool in an adversary's arsenal.
