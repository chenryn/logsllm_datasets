A QUESTIONNAIRE
The questionnaire uses the following structure: Questions in bold are re-
quired. Circles denote single selection answers. Boxes denote optional
multiple selection answers. Tables with circles denote single response per
row. Tables with boxes denote optional multiple responses per row. Ques-
tions without selections allow free text answers.
Please note: The wording of this example questionnaire is for employees.
In our study, participants were shown specific wording based on their
selection during “For Starters.”

Misconfigurations happen
We are all human beings and we make mistakes. (At least I’m fairly sure
I’mnottheonlyone.)Therefore,weassumethatfaultysecurityconfigura-
tions that may lead or even have lead to leaked, lost or distorted data must
be a lot more common than we perceive them to be. We want to explore
what experiences YOU, the operators, have had with misconfigurations -
regardless of whether they happened to yourselves, you discovered them
or you were the ones fixing them.
We also believe that knowing how they occur may allow for measures to
reduce the risk of misconfigurations - measures not only addressing the
operators, but all departments through all levels of management that af-
fect the design and maintenance of a system in some way. Therefore, the

following questions aren’t designed to only gather abstract data but to
also incorporate your personal views and opinions - if you want. :)
This survey is the main task of my master thesis in media informatics at
the Beuth University of Applied Sciences in collaboration with the Tech-
nical University Berlin.2
Your answers remain entirely anonymous. We’re not aiming for sensitive
information. Nevertheless, be assured that we hold ourselves responsible
for preserving your anonymity.
We need you!
Wealreadylearnedthatoperatorsareusuallyquitebusyoperatingthings;
but if you can spare 10 to 20 minutes to fill out this questionnaire, please
do! Each and every contribution is important and helps us and eventually
fellow operators a lot!
PS
If you’d like to get brief updates and a summary of our findings, you may
leave your email adress at the end of the survey in a separate form. Also,
if you happen to answer these questions on your phone, they render best
after switching to landscape mode.
