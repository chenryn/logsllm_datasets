User: How do I begin learning Twisted? What books, documentation or tutorial do you guys recommend?
The reason I asked this question is that I think learning Twisted would help me otherwise also in learning concepts related to network programming (terminologies and how it works and stuff) I have heard that the documentation for Twisted is not that good. Is is true?
Note that I am looking for some advise that actually helped you. I am looking for your experience. PS: I am aware of the official documentation. There is also the O'Reilly Book on Twisted; is that good?
Assistant: Look at the samples that come with twisted's documentation. Also, the documentation is not bad, but it is not very complete. Also, the API docs are quite good in fact. 
When you know with which part you start, just try and play with the code until you're stuck, then google samples relating to your code and ask on stackoverflow.
