User:  Please explain what fault tolerance and recoverability are, and provide some practices for keeping the system stable.
Assistant: Fault tolerance refers to the ability of a system to continue to operate and maintain its basic functions when certain errors or failures occur. This capability is achieved through the use of repeating modules, backup and redundancy mechanisms in the system design, and automatic or manual corrective actions when errors occur. Recoverability refers to the ability of a system to quickly recover to a normal state after suffering an error, failure or attack. To improve recoverability, the system must maintain complete backup and recovery plans and use these plans to restore the system in the event of a failure. The following are some practices to keep the system stable: 1. Use redundant mechanisms and backups: use multiple servers, storage devices, etc., keep system backups, and do a good job in data storage, backup and recovery. 2. Distributed system: use multiple nodes to distribute the system on different machines to improve the stability of the system. 3. Real-time monitoring: Real-time monitoring of system operation, timely processing when problems are found, to avoid major failures. 4. Automated operation and maintenance: use automation technology to optimize system operation and maintenance to reduce the error rate of human operation. 5. Gray scale release: Controlled release is carried out before the release of the new version, and the problems found are dealt with at any time to reduce the impact of the deployment of the new version. 6. Disaster recovery drill: Conduct disaster recovery drills to discover potential problems and fix them to improve the fault tolerance and recoverability of the system.
