5.4 Feature differentiability
The challenge addressed in this section is diﬀerentiation
among the feature sets. Extracting features and plotting
the two feature vectors against each other, sorted by closest
pulse count, the clustering diagrams visualize the diﬀeren-
tiability of the feature sets. Figure 17 shows that the clas-
siﬁers can produce enough distinction between Seven per-
sons in both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight cases. This
clustering diagram does not include packet count or timing
information.
Figure 17: Clustering diagram of gait features demonstrates
diﬀerentiation with the two feature sets aligned by time.
When removing packets that had little Doppler or mul-
tipath interference and adding packet count to the feature
set, the simple na¨ıve Bayes classiﬁer was correct 87% with
line-of-sight and 77% with behind-wall (Table 1).
6. RELATED WORK
This section describes previous studies addressing the chal-
lenges of monitoring humans to perform actions and mod-
eling human behaviors by tracking body parts, identifying
persons, and localizing individuals [29]. Sensors currently
used include RF antennas, cameras, capacitors, accelerom-
eters, and ultrasonic detectors. The following sections are
previous work categorized by image capture (sections 6.1)
and RF (section 6.2). All reviewed works of RF have failed
to identify and localize individuals based on intrinsic body
movement.
Unlike previous research, this paper proﬁles the human
gait by encoding multipathing and Doppler Eﬀect to cre-
580ate signatures for biometrics, enabling tracking and tagging.
This technique uses existing Wi-Fi signals utilizing only a
receiver SDR system with through-wall penetration.
6.1 Imaging Capture and Processing
This section discusses recent research for human identiﬁ-
cation using computer vision. Traditional image capture sys-
tems require direct LoS or special thermal cameras. These
systems are expensive in terms of installation and computa-
tional needs. Cameras raise issues with privacy and infor-
mation assurance, as those devices are easily hacked.
Leveraging computation power of the cloud, eyewear can
detect subjects using facial recognition [35].
InSight pro-
vides identiﬁcation of individuals without facial recognition
by color pattern and behavior matching [33]. PIXEL enables
light based positioning systems using light based modulation
using a low resolution camera [40].
6.2 RF and Wireless system
This section discusses previous research done to sense hu-
man movements using RF (section 6.2.1) and RF based lo-
calization techniques (section 6.2.2). RF allows for NLoS
and lower cost architecture. All reviewed research has not
been shown to produce biometrics on individuals’ gait.
6.2.1 Using RF Waves to Sense Persons or Body Parts
Recent research used human signals detected by RF sen-
sors have provided the possibility of automation. These sys-
tems had the ability to penetrate walls, track body parts,
and sense multiple persons’ locations [24]. Channel State
Information (CSI) based human Activity Recognition and
Monitoring (CARM ) system identiﬁes human body parts
speed and speciﬁc activity. WiDraw uses Wi-Fi signals’
Angle-of-Arrival to track hand trajectories to an error rate
lower than ﬁve cm. WiDraw achieved recognition of let-
ters, words, and sentences to an accuracy rate of 91% [30].
By using inaudible sound pulses, AAMouse can turn a hu-
man hand into a mouse. AAMouse measures both sound
frequency shift and the phase of the Wi-Fi signal to track
the device at an error rate of 1.4 cm [42]. WiTrack uses
Time-of-Flight from multiple antennas to locate individu-
als through walls [1], and WiTrack2.0 introduces Succes-
sive Silhouette Cancellation to localize multiple persons [3].
E-Gesture is an energy eﬃcient gesture recognition system
which uses motion sensing and smart phones [25]. These
systems did not provide biometrics or speciﬁc person sig-
nature detection, but they are focused on localization and
detecting movements.
6.2.2 Using Electromagnetic Waves to Localize
Tracking devices and individuals have been studied heav-
ily using Signal Strength (SS), Time Diﬀerence of Arrival
(TDoA), and Angle of Arrival (AoA) [22]. These techniques
always use some sort of statistical algorithm with geome-
try to determine location. SpotOn uses CSI and applies
algorithms to estimate the direction and triangulation from
multiple Wi-Fi access points. SpotOn achieved accuracy of
0.6m in LoS and 1.5m in NLoS cases [17]. Tadar tracks
moving objects using Commercial of the Self RFID readers
and tags in 2D plane, converting RFIDs into antenna arrays
for through-wall detection [38]. RFID receivers and trans-
mitters placements optimization were studied to improve ac-
curacy [32]. FollowME uses geomagnetic ﬁeld and natural
walking patterns from previous users for navigation in in-
door and semi-outdoor scenarios [28]. APIT is a range free
solution for random nodes with irregular radio patterns [12].
SpinLoc is able to provide precise indoor localization using
Doppler Eﬀect [7]. A distributed online learning algorithm
was able to converge on the location using a wireless sensor
network [11].
7. FUTURE WORK
For Wobly to function in the real-world, it must track mul-
tiple persons and adapt to room changes. WiTrack2.0 [3]
has already studied tracking multiple persons and limbs.
For multiple room conﬁguration cases, the two main meth-
ods are empirical-based machine learning and propagation
scattering inversion. Machine learning requires calibration,
and scattering inversion requires numeric solutions to large
amount of non-linear Maxwell equations. Techniques like
deep-learning should also ﬁt the changing scattered ﬁeld
to human movement, resulting in ﬁne location information.
Both techniques should model noise from weather or other
interferences. We recognize that the current empirical data
is limited, requiring more diverse testing subjects, but Wobly
extends existing developed gait-based biometric analysis.
8. CONCLUSIONS
We present Wobly, a SDR system, that encoded individu-
als’ gaits and room conﬁguration by reﬂecting Wi-Fi signals
oﬀ of individuals. The encoded signatures preserved privacy
through the uniqueness of how individuals move and the
channel interference. We presented 1) methods of tracking
individuals in LoS and NLoS, showing uniqueness of signa-
tures, which is encoded by gaits and room conﬁgurations;
2) signal processing techniques to measure human bodies’
Doppler shift and multipathing creating biometric signa-
tures; and 3) empirical analysis to diﬀerentiate people walk-
ing in LoS and NLoS. Using wavelets, Wobly characterized
the signatures providing feature vectors for a Na¨ıve Bayes
Classiﬁer. A clustering visualization utilized the two feature
vectors and demonstrated that individual gaits are diﬀeren-
tiable. A simple Na¨ıve Bayes classiﬁers identiﬁed persons
at 87% and 77% correctness in LoS and NLoS cases respec-
tively. Using Wi-Fi signals, this method penetrated a wall
and did not require additional attached devices or special
signals.
