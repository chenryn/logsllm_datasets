User: I am currently using gaeunit to perform automated test on my google app engine application. I am wondering whether it's possible to simulate the user login action using his/her google account using gaeunit? 
Thank you very much.
Assistant: Two situations:

Local Dev server: login is mocked via a simple web form. You can do a http POST to log in.
Production server: login goes through the Google auth infrastructure. No way to mock this. To make this work you'd need to code around it.
