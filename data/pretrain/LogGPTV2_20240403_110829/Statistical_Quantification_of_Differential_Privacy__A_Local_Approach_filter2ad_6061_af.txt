simulated lower bounds (instead of just a single one), giving
insight into the variance of LB. The dashed vertical lines
(in the same color as the corresponding cdfs) indicate the
targeted privacy parameters 0 and the horizontal, red line
the prescribed conﬁdence level 1 − α, where we have chosen
α = 0.05.
For the correct algorithms (a) - (f) an important feature
of the empirical cdfs is their location. Note that evaluated in
the targeted privacy parameter 0 = , the cdf describes the
conﬁdence level P(LB ≤ ), which according to our theory
should approximately equal 1−α (see Theorem 2). Therefore,
we would expect our empirical cdfs to pass through the
intersection of the horizontal conﬁdence level and the vertical
targeted privacy level. In most scenarios we observe that the
prescribed conﬁdence level is indeed well approximated, while
sometimes it is slightly too large (corresponding to small
values of LB).
This tendency is inherent in the empirical study of DP and
should not surprise us: To approximate , one has to ﬁrst
select the right data pair out of B pairs and then empirically
maximize the privacy loss. Poor performance in either step
biases estimates away from  towards smaller values - a trend
that has been observed in other empirical studies (see e.g. [19],
where the p-values are in each instance much higher than the
prescribed level).
A second performance measure for our correct algorithms
is the ascent of the cdf in a neighborhood of : In most of
our simulations (a)-(f) we observe a rapid increase close to ,
suggesting that LB is a tight and reliable bound for . In the
case of SVT2 and SVT4 the ascent is slightly slower in the
high privacy regime 0 = 0.2, which hints at higher variance
in LB caused by smaller values of the discrete densities.
As for the incorrect algorithms (g) and (h), the feature that
provides the most conclusive information on the performance
of MPL is the location of the empirical cdfs. To be more
exact, a lower bound LB to the right of the targeted privacy
parameter exposes a false privacy claim (this corresponds to
a right-shift of the empirical cdf). We observe that LB is
usually sampled to the right of its targeted privacy parameter
0 (with almost certainty for (g) and in the middle and low
privacy regime for (h)), often with a large margin. In the high

privacy regime for (h), we sometimes observe LB ≤ 0, due
to increased variance. In conclusion, the experiments conﬁrm
the performance of MPL with respect to ﬂawed algorithms.
Sample sizes and runtime: After considering the statis-
tical results of our experiments, we want to brieﬂy discuss
computational aspects. Our MPL algorithm relies on standard
statistical tools that are provided by many programming lan-
guages such as R. It is therefore convenient to implement
for users. Conﬁrming this ease of applicability, we have run
our simulations on a standard desktop computer (3.4 GHz
Intel Core i5 CPU, 4 cores, 16 GB RAM). Under the above
conditions runtimes range from 10 seconds for the smaller
sample sizes (used for algorithms (a)-(d)) to less than one
minute for the larger sample sizes (used for algorithms (e)-(h)).
The precise runtimes are reported in Table II and are shorter
than those given in [21], where the above algorithms are also
analyzed (except for the exponential mechanism). Importantly,
[21] also rely on a much more powerful machine, with 128
cores at 1.2GHz and 500 GB RAM.
Our gains in terms of runtime are mainly achieved by cutting
sampling efforts. For instance, consider B = 10 pairs of
neighboring databases as input for the MPL algorithm and
its counterpart in [21], DD-Search. Then the total sampling
effort associated with one run of MPL amounts to 5× 105 for
the smaller samples (algorithms (a)-(d)) and 3 × 106 for the
larger ones (algorithms (e)-(h)). This corresponds to ≈ 0.05%
and ≈ 0.32% of the sample sizes that would be used by the
DD-Search algorithm in [21]. This means that we rely only
on a small fraction of the data used in [21].
