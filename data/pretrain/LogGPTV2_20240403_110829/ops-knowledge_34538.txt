User: What is the best way to include a 'helper' shell script in setup.py that is used by a python module? I don't want to include is as a script since it is not run on it's own.
Also, data_files just copies things in the the install path (not the module install path) so that does not really seem like the best route.
I guess the question is: is there a way of including non-python (non-C) scripts/binaries in a python distutils package in a generic way?
Assistant: Another issue might be that such pypi packages containing Bash scripts might not run correctly on e.g. Windows?
