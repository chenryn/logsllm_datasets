easily adapted to other screen sizes, as illustrated in Figure 14. For
a mobile phone with a small touch screen like Apple iPhone, a user
can use a hand A to perform the hand-shielding gesture, and use the
other hand B to hold the phone. The thumb on hand B can be used
to press the response keys. For a mobile phone with a larger touch
screen like Samsumg Galaxy Note II, a user may not be able to
click all the keys with the thumb of hand B that holds the device.
To deal with this situation, he only needs to use one hand A to
perform the hand-shielding gesture and key pressing sequentially.
Once the user raises his hand before pressing a key, the hidden
transformation immediately disappears because the gesture is no
longer detected by the touch screen. Meantime, the user does not
need to worry about whether the actual keys pressed or the ﬁnger
movements during key pressing may be observed by an adversary,
as the sequence of pressed keys alone does not leak any information
about the underlying password as analyzed in Section 4.
6.3 Limitations
Ecological validity is a challenging issue in any user study. Like
most prior research [19, 27, 26, 15, 24], our experiments engage
only university students. These participants are younger and more
educated compared to the general population. Therefore, usability
evaluation may vary with other populations. Our experiments are

also restricted by the sample size, which may affect the results of
statistical tests. Typical examples are the insigniﬁcant results on
the login accuracy of our schemes. Moreover, our user study does
not include experiments on memory effects (e.g. forgetting). Since
our scheme uses the same alphabet and password composition as
legacy passwords, the users may use the same coping strategies
to help themselves to memorize the passwords in our scheme. The
impact of memory effects on the user performance would be similar
to legacy passwords as shown in the prior literature [14, 34].
7. RELATED WORK
In this section, we summarize closely related work on achieving
leakage resilience of password entry in three different aspects.
Although the problem of achieving leakage resilience of pass-
word entry was proposed two decades ago [29], it is still a chal-
lenge to design a practical solution till now. Early work in this
direction [19, 27, 38, 39, 5] focused on designing schemes solely
rely on the cognitive capability of human beings. Unfortunately, all
such schemes with acceptable usability have been broken [27, 38,
39, 5]. Recent investigations [11, 40] provided strong evidence for
the necessity to construct a protected environment to hide certain
user interaction during password entry in order to achieve both se-
curity and usability. The establishment of such protected environ-
ment may require the features only available from new user inter-
face technologies. A few schemes [26, 33, 13, 15, 24, 8, 7] were de-
signed in this strategy. Among them, our scheme design was mostly
inspired by the concept of physical metaphor introduced in [24].
Our scheme distinguishes itself from prior work in the sense that
it not only achieves leakage resilience but also retains most ben-
eﬁts of legacy passwords, while some of prior schemes [33, 15]
are ﬂawed in terms of security, and the others incur extra usabil-
ity costs due to various reasons including: 1) using an uncommon
device such as gaze tracker [26, 13], haptic motor [8], and large
pressure-sensitive screen [24], 2) requiring an extra accessory de-
vice [7], and 3) inoperable in a non-stationary environment [8].
On the other hand, the procedure of applying random transfor-
mations on a ﬁxed password used in our scheme design is a clas-
sic idea to prevent password leakage, but it is not easy to be re-
alized in a human-friendly manner without the new user interface
technologies, which are only available on modern computing de-
vices. These new technologies give our scheme advantages when
compared to recently patented schemes. Take GridCode [17] as
an example, which asks users to memorize extra secrets (besides
the passwords) in order to perform the transformations speciﬁed in
its scheme design, while our scheme does not have such require-
ment. Another advantage of our scheme is that each character of
the password uses a different hidden transformation during an au-
thentication attempt, while GridCode uses the same transformation
for all the characters in the password. If a hidden transformation in
GridCode is disclosed, the entire password will be exposed. How-
ever, if a hidden transformation in our scheme is disclosed, only
the single character associated with the transformation will be ex-
posed. These two fundamental differences show both security and
usability advantages of our scheme.
In terms of design principles, Roth et al. [32] proposed to use a
cognitive trapdoor game to transform the knowledge of the under-
lying password into obfuscated responses. Li and Shum [27] later
suggested three other principles including time-variant responses,
randomness in challenges and responses, and indistinguishability
against statistical analysis. Yan et al. [40] further extended the cov-
erage by including the design principles against brute force attacks,
and provided concrete guidelines against generic statistical attacks.
Our proposed scheme follows all these design principles to avoid
corresponding security ﬂaws.
Bonneau et al. [10] recently proposed a generic framework for
evaluating user authentication proposals and emphasized the im-
portance of retaining the beneﬁts of legacy passwords. Their frame-
work introduced twenty-ﬁve beneﬁts covering usability, deploya-
bility and security. This framework is used in our study to guide
the scheme design in retaining the beneﬁts of legacy passwords.
Other research on password-based user authentication can be found
in a recent survey paper [9], which summarized the development of
new password schemes in the past decade.
8. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed a leakage-resilient password entry
scheme leveraging on the touch screen feature of mobile devices.
It improves leakage resilience while preserving most beneﬁts of
legacy passwords. Three variants of this scheme were imple-
mented. The practicability of our scheme was evaluated in an ex-
tended user study that incorporates new experiments to examine the
inﬂuence of additional test conditions related to time pressure, dis-
traction, and mental workload. These conditions were tested for the
ﬁrst time in the evaluation of user authentication schemes. Among
these conditions, time pressure and mental workload were shown
to have signiﬁcant impacts on user performance. Therefore, we
suggest including these conditions in the evaluation of user authen-
tication schemes in the future research.

A. STATISTICAL TEST RESULTS
In this section, we provide the detailed results of statistical tests.
Table 3 shows the results for login time, which indicates that the
same test condition may have difference impact on the login time
of different schemes.

The results of statistical tests on login accuracy are not shown as
none of them indicate signiﬁcance. This is caused by the ceiling ef-
fect, which can be observed from the data shown in Table 4. Even
in the worst case, 50.0% participants did not make any mistakes
during all tests in the test condition, which implies our tests are not
sufﬁciently difﬁcult to distinguish these test conditions regarding
their inﬂuence on the login accuracy of our schemes. This could be
caused by the simple design of our schemes such that they are easy
to use even in the presence of time pressure, distraction, and mental
workload. However, it does not necessarily imply that these factors
will not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the login accuracy of other user au-
thentication schemes. Since the average results of login accuracy
are observed to be worse due to the presence of these factors in our
tests, we expect they would have a more signiﬁcant inﬂuence on
other schemes with higher complexity.
