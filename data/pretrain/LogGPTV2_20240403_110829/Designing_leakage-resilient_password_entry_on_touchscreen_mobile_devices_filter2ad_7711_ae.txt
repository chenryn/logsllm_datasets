### Adaptability to Different Screen Sizes

The proposed method is easily adaptable to various screen sizes, as illustrated in Figure 14. For a mobile phone with a small touch screen, such as the Apple iPhone, a user can perform the hand-shielding gesture with one hand (Hand A) and hold the phone with the other hand (Hand B). The thumb of Hand B can be used to press the response keys. On a mobile phone with a larger touch screen, like the Samsung Galaxy Note II, it may be challenging to reach all the keys with the thumb of Hand B, which holds the device. In this case, the user can use Hand A to sequentially perform the hand-shielding gesture and key pressing. When the user raises their hand before pressing a key, the hidden transformation immediately disappears because the gesture is no longer detected by the touch screen. Additionally, the user does not need to worry about whether the actual keys pressed or the finger movements during key pressing are observed by an adversary, as the sequence of pressed keys alone does not leak any information about the underlying password, as analyzed in Section 4.

### 6.3 Limitations

Ecological validity is a significant challenge in any user study. Like most prior research [19, 27, 26, 15, 24], our experiments involved only university students, who are generally younger and more educated than the general population. This demographic difference may lead to variations in usability evaluations. Our experiments were also limited by the sample size, which could affect the results of statistical tests. For example, the results on login accuracy for our schemes were not statistically significant. Moreover, our user study did not include experiments on memory effects, such as forgetting. Since our scheme uses the same alphabet and password composition as legacy passwords, users may employ the same coping strategies to help them memorize the passwords. The impact of memory effects on user performance would likely be similar to that of legacy passwords, as shown in previous literature [14, 34].

### 7. Related Work

In this section, we summarize closely related work on achieving leakage resilience in password entry across three different aspects. Although the problem of achieving leakage resilience in password entry was first proposed two decades ago [29], designing a practical solution remains a challenge. Early work in this direction [19, 27, 38, 39, 5] focused on leveraging human cognitive capabilities. Unfortunately, all such schemes with acceptable usability have been compromised [27, 38, 39, 5]. Recent studies [11, 40] have provided strong evidence for the necessity of creating a protected environment to hide certain user interactions during password entry, ensuring both security and usability. Establishing such an environment often requires features available from new user interface technologies. Several schemes [26, 33, 13, 15, 24, 8, 7] have been designed using this strategy. Our scheme design was particularly inspired by the concept of physical metaphor introduced in [24].

Our scheme stands out from prior work in that it not only achieves leakage resilience but also retains most of the benefits of legacy passwords. Some previous schemes [33, 15] have security flaws, while others incur additional usability costs due to factors such as:
1. Using uncommon devices like gaze trackers [26, 13], haptic motors [8], and large pressure-sensitive screens [24].
2. Requiring extra accessory devices [7].
3. Being inoperable in non-stationary environments [8].

The process of applying random transformations to a fixed password, as used in our scheme, is a classic idea to prevent password leakage. However, it is challenging to implement in a user-friendly manner without modern user interface technologies. These technologies give our scheme advantages over recently patented schemes, such as GridCode [17], which requires users to memorize additional secrets to perform the specified transformations. In contrast, our scheme does not have such requirements. Furthermore, each character in the password uses a different hidden transformation during an authentication attempt, whereas GridCode uses the same transformation for all characters. If a hidden transformation in GridCode is disclosed, the entire password is exposed. In our scheme, only the single character associated with the disclosed transformation is exposed. These differences highlight both the security and usability advantages of our scheme.

In terms of design principles, Roth et al. [32] proposed using a cognitive trapdoor game to transform the knowledge of the underlying password into obfuscated responses. Li and Shum [27] later suggested three other principles: time-variant responses, randomness in challenges and responses, and indistinguishability against statistical analysis. Yan et al. [40] extended these principles to include design guidelines against brute force attacks and generic statistical attacks. Our proposed scheme adheres to all these principles to avoid corresponding security flaws.

Bonneau et al. [10] recently proposed a generic framework for evaluating user authentication proposals, emphasizing the importance of retaining the benefits of legacy passwords. Their framework includes twenty-five benefits covering usability, deployability, and security. We used this framework to guide our scheme design in retaining the benefits of legacy passwords. Other research on password-based user authentication can be found in a recent survey paper [9], which summarizes the development of new password schemes over the past decade.

### 8. Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed a leakage-resilient password entry scheme that leverages the touch screen feature of mobile devices. This scheme improves leakage resilience while preserving most of the benefits of legacy passwords. Three variants of this scheme were implemented. The practicability of our scheme was evaluated through an extended user study that included new experiments to examine the influence of additional test conditions related to time pressure, distraction, and mental workload. These conditions were tested for the first time in the evaluation of user authentication schemes. Among these conditions, time pressure and mental workload were found to have significant impacts on user performance. Therefore, we recommend including these conditions in future evaluations of user authentication schemes.

### Appendix

#### A. Statistical Test Results

In this section, we provide the detailed results of statistical tests. Table 3 shows the results for login time, indicating that the same test condition may have different impacts on the login time of different schemes.

**Average Login Time of NumPad-Add**
- Omnibus KW χ² = 32.423, p < .001
- Normal: 10.4
- Distraction: 11.2
- Mental Workload: 11.8
- Mental Workload + Timed: 10.7

**Average Login Time of LetterPad-Shift**
- Omnibus KW χ² = 49.252, p < .001
- Normal: 13.2

**Average Login Time of NumPad-Shift**
- Omnibus KW χ² = 11.965, p = .034

| Scheme | Condition | Average Login Time (sec) |
|--------|-----------|--------------------------|
| NumPad-Add | Normal | 10.4 |
| NumPad-Add | Distraction | 11.2 |
| NumPad-Add | Mental Workload | 11.8 |
| NumPad-Add | Mental Workload + Timed | 10.7 |
| LetterPad-Shift | Normal | 13.2 |
| NumPad-Shift | Normal | 11.7 |
| NumPad-Shift | Distraction | 13.5 |
| NumPad-Shift | Mental Workload | 13.3 |
| NumPad-Shift | Mental Workload + Timed | 11.4 |

The results of statistical tests on login accuracy are not shown, as none of them indicate significance. This is due to the ceiling effect, which can be observed from the data in Table 4. Even in the worst case, 50.0% of participants did not make any mistakes during all tests in the test condition, implying that our tests are not sufficiently difficult to distinguish the influence of these test conditions on the login accuracy of our schemes. This could be due to the simple design of our schemes, making them easy to use even under time pressure, distraction, and mental workload. However, this does not necessarily imply that these factors will not significantly influence the login accuracy of other user authentication schemes. Since the average results of login accuracy are observed to be worse due to the presence of these factors in our tests, we expect they would have a more significant influence on other schemes with higher complexity.
