I went back to complete some of the new challenges in html/css and jquery
sections that were added with the most recent update. When I complete the
challenge and click to next, it takes me to a lesson I have already completed
(next in line on the map) rather than the next incomplete lesson and gives me
credit (items completed number in the corner) for doing it again.
Issue: I am getting credit for lessons I have already completed in past when I
do them again.
