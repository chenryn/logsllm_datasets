virtual machine image. For a common disk file, we could encrypt 
the  master  boot  record  (MBR),  Boot,  and  some  logic  partitions. 
But in a cloud environment, some virtual machines may have the 
same MBR or boot. Thus, it is easy to copy a VM to attack other 
VMs.  In  addition,  we  have  designed  an  image  file  encryption, 
which  is  based  on  the  file  system  and  user's  configuration.  We 
first get the user's symmetric key, which is protected by TPM, and 
get the partition and file system type information from the MBR, 
then read the user's encryption conﬁguration. Finally, we encrypt 
the  ﬁle  contained  in  the  conﬁguration,  and  then  encrypt  key 
information of a file system, such as index structure.  
The  measurement  mechanism  of  VM  provides  the  integrity 
measurement of a VM before it starts. The integrity of a system is a 
semantic  concept  that  indicates  whether  the  system  has  been 
modiﬁed in an unauthorized manner. Measuring an entire system is 
very  expensive  in  practice.  One  efficient  way  is  to  associate  the 
integrity semantics with some important files. In our mechanism, we 
measure the most important files of different systems and some files 
deﬁned  by  users.  For  Linux  systems,  we  have  measured  the  boot, 
grub, kernel, kernel modules, binaries shared libraries and dynamic 
libraries.  For  Linux  users,  we  should  measure  the  data  and 
applications. If the VM is a web server, we  should  measure  httpd, 
mod_access.so, and libjvm.so. 
On the other hand, since current static trust technology does not 
provide  a  sufficient  protection  for  run-time  security  of  VMs  in 
cloud.  To  solve  this  problem,  a  unified  extensible  firmware 
interface  (UEFI)  based  dynamic  security  framework  for  virtual 
machines  is  proposed.  In  our  dynamic  measurement  framework, 
UEFI  firmware  is  considered  as  a  trusted  computing  base  to 
acquire a run-time and dynamic security measurement for VMM 
and virtual machines, which provides dynamic protection out  of 
traditional  solution.  And  we  also  implement  a  prototype  for  the 
Xen  hypervisor.  According  to  experiments  and  analysis,  the 
framework can measure and explore various attacks from virtual 
domains, hypervisor and virtualization software.

With  the  extensive  use  of  cloud  terminals  in  the  IaaS  cloud 
environment, it also faces huge security threats. For example, if a 
cloud terminal has been attacked by viruses or Trojan horses and 
tries to access the cloud virtual network, there is a great chance 
that it will make the services and infrastructures in the cloud more 
vulnerable  to  attacks  and  even  lead  to  the  disclosure  of  user 
sensitive  information  and  the  break  of  cloud  service  security. 
Therefore,  it  is  vital  to  ensure  that  the  cloud  terminal  is  not 
tampered with and is trusted. 
To solve the trust of access terminal, we propose a fundamental 
architecture  of  the  trusted  cloud  terminal  based  on  the  MTM 
(Mobile  Trusted  Modules)  specification,  which  is  proposed  by 
TCG  and  defines  the  security  features  of  the  terminal.  We’ve 
integrated the TPM2.0 chip into the Intel Utralbook, thin Desktop, 
and Pad, and then realized trusted boot, authentication and TNC 
(trusted Network Connection) in the terminals, so as to ensure the 
security of cloud terminal. The trusted cloud terminal architecture 
is shown in Fig. 2.  
For a cloud terminal, the trusted hardware such as TPM2.0 is 
considered  as  the  trusted  root  on  which  the  platform  security  is 
ensured  by  secure  operating  systems,  trusted  boot  and  security 
be 
services. 
Furthermore,

ensure  the  trusted  launch  and  running  of  a  VM  in  IaaS  cloud. 
Furthermore,  the  trusted  network  connection  was  introduced  to 
secure 
provide 
communication  channel.  Finally  a 
terminal 
architecture and its security features were defined to construct a 
trusted protection system for a cloud terminal.  The E2E trusted 
cloud infrastructure provides the E2E trusted protection for cloud 
computing.

achieved  based  on  system  security.  When  a  cloud  terminal 
attempts  to  access  cloud  virtual  network,  the  measurement 
module  and  remote  attestation  module  will  measure  the  cloud 
terminal  and  do  the  integrity  verification  of  the  terminal,  then 
provide  a  credible  platform  status  report  of  boot  module, 
operating  system  kernel  and  some  key  applications  to  verify 
whether the cloud terminal is trusted or not. In addition, a trust-
enhanced  authentication  mechanism  based  on  TPM  also  can 
achieve a two-way authentication between a user and a VM.  
We  also  use  TNC  to  establish  the  trusted  communication 
between VMs and  cloud  terminals.  Based  on  TPM  chips  on  the 
cloud provider and terminal, VMs and cloud terminals can build 
trusted 
identity  authentication  and  security  communication 
channel.  
Our system uses the TPM 2.0 chip and specification which can 
support Chinese cryptographic algorithm, such as SMx. Moreover 
we implement TSS 2.0 based on TCG software stack draft to call 
the function of the TPM 2.0 chip.
