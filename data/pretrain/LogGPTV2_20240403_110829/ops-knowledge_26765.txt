Question: "Why is it not recommended to implement a custom Key Derivation Function (KDF) when the hardware uses a KDF that does not match the test expectation for Android device encryption?"
 "A": "A custom KDF can lead to compatibility issues with the expected key derivation during testing."
 "B": "Custom KDFs generally reduce the overall security of the device by introducing vulnerabilities."
 "C": "Hardware-wrapped keys are less secure when a custom KDF is used, as they can be easily extracted and used off-device."
 "D": "Using a custom KDF would prevent the usage of AES-256-GCM with random IVs, which is a strong AEAD required by Android."
Answer: A
