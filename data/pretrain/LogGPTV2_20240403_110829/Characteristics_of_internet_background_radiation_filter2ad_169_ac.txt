### Analysis of Network Traffic Patterns

#### Class A Trace Collection and Malware Outbreaks
The Class A trace was collected in March, not May, when several large worm and malware outbreaks, including the Sasser worm, were observed. Notably, approximately 99% of the observed TCP packets are TCP/SYN.

#### ICMP Packet Analysis
At LBL, a significant number of ICMP packets (over 99.9% being ICMP/echo-req) form daily high-volume spikes, as shown in Figure 6. These spikes are attributed to a small number of sources scanning every address in the observed networks. In contrast, the Class A monitor sees far fewer ICMP packets, likely because the Welchia worm, which uses ICMP/echo-req, avoids the Class A network.

#### UDP Packet Observation at UW
The low rate of UDP packets observed at UW is primarily due to the filtering of UDP port 1434, which is associated with the Slammer worm.

#### TCP/SYN Packet Analysis
Figure 6 also illustrates that TCP/SYN packets at LBL arrive at a relatively steady rate, similar to the other two networks, in contrast to the daily ICMP spikes. A detailed breakdown of TCP/SYN packets by destination port numbers at LBL (Table 4) reveals that a few ports (listed in the table) account for more than 83% of the packets.

#### Source Traffic Breakdown
Table 3 provides a breakdown of the same traces from the perspective of the traffic sources. Note that the rows are not mutually exclusive, as one host may send both TCP and UDP packets. TCP packets dominate the population of source hosts. The distribution across ports of LBL traffic is shown in Table 4, where a small number of ports are dominant.

| Protocol | UW | LBL |
|----------|----|-----|
| TCP      | 759,324 (87.9%) | 586,025 (90.0%) |
| ICMP     | 109,135 (12.6%) | 64,120 (9.8%) |
| UDP      | 4,273 (0.5%)    | 4,360 (0.7%) |

#### Popular TCP Ports
Table 4 lists the most popular TCP ports, showing the number of source IPs and packets for each port. The top eight ports account for more than 83% of the packets.

| TCP Port | # Source IP (%) | # Packets (%) |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| 445      | 43.4%           | 19.7%         |
| 80       | 28.7%           | 7.3%          |
| 135      | 19.1%           | 30.4%         |
| 1025     | 4.3%            | 5.8%          |
| 2745     | 3.2%            | 3.6%          |
| 139      | 3.2%            | 11.1%         |
| 3127     | 2.7%            | 3.2%          |
| 6129     | 2.2%            | 2.4%          |

#### Intentions of TCP/SYN Packets
Given that TCP/SYN packets constitute a significant portion of the background radiation traffic observed on passive networks, the next question is, "What are the intentions of these connection requests?" This question is explored in Sections 5 and 6.

### Analysis of Backscatter Activity

Backscatter refers to unsolicited traffic resulting from responses to attacks spoofed with a network's IP address. Figure 7 provides a time-series graph of backscatter activity seen on the four networks. TCP RSTs and SYN-ACKs account for the majority of scans in all four networks, which are common responses to a spoofed SYN-flood (Denial of Service) attack.

#### Backscatter Patterns in Different Networks
- **UW Networks**: The backscatter in the two UW networks (UW I and UW II) shows similar patterns in terms of volume and variability, particularly in TCP RSTs/SYN-ACKs and ICMP TTL-Exceeded. The only difference is that UW I receives more "Communication administratively prohibited" ICMP messages.
- **Class A Network**: The Class A network attracts more backscatter in other categories, as shown in Figure 7(e). There are significant differences in the RSTs between the Class A and UW networks.
- **LBL Network**: The LBL graph (Figure 7(c)) shows a different pattern compared to UW for the same week, but the dominant traffic types (TCP RSTs/SYN-ACKs and ICMP TTL-Exceeded) are similar. This is expected since the two UW networks and the LBL network belong to the same /8 network. However, the LBL network receives fewer scans in other categories.

### Conclusion
The analysis of network traffic patterns, including TCP/SYN, ICMP, and UDP packets, provides insights into the behavior of different networks. The backscatter activity further highlights the impact of spoofed attacks and the need for robust network security measures.
