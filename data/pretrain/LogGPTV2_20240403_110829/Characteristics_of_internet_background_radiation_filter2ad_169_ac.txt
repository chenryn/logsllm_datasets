that the Class A trace was collected in Mar instead in May, when
we see a few large worm/malware outbreaks (include the Sasser
worm). Not shown in the table, about 99% of the observed TCP
packets are TCP/SYN.
The large number of ICMP packets (of which more than 99.9%
are ICMP/echo-req) we see at LBL form daily high volume
spikes (Figure 6), which are the result of a small number of sources
scanning every address in the observed networks. On the other
hand we see a lot fewer ICMP packets at the Class A monitor
which is probably because the Welchia worm, which probes with
ICMP/echo-req, avoids the Class A network.
Finally, the surprising low rate of UDP packets observed at UW
is largely due to the artifact that UW ﬁlters UDP port 1434 (the
Slammer worm).
In Figure 6, we can also see that TCP/SYN packets seen at LBL
arrive at a relatively steady rate, (and this is the case for the other
two networks as well) in contrast to daily ICMP spikes. A closer
look at the breakdown of TCP/SYN packets by destination port
numbers at LBL (Table 4) reveals that a small number of ports are

in the table account for more than 83% of the packets).
Table 3 shows the same traces from the perspective of the source
of the trafﬁc. Note that the rows are not mutually exclusive as one
host may send both TCP and UDP packets. It is clear that TCP
packets dominate in the population of source hosts we see. The
distribution across ports of LBL trafﬁc is shown in Table 4; as be-
fore, a small number of ports are dominant.

Table 4: The Most Popular TCP Ports. Ports that are visited by
the most number of source IPs, as in a one week passive trace at
LBL. In total there are 12,037,064 packets from 651,126 distinct
source IP addresses.
As TCP/SYN packets constitute a signiﬁcant portion of the
background radiation trafﬁc observed on a passive network, the
next obvious question is, “What are the intentions of these con-
nection requests?”. We explore this question in Section 5 and 6.
4.2 Analysis of Backscatter Activity
The term Backscatter is commonly used to refer to unsolicited
trafﬁc that is the result of responses to attacks spoofed with a net-
work’s IP address. Figure 7 provides a time-series graph of the
backscatter activity seen on the four networks. Not surprisingly,
TCP RSTs and SYN-ACKs account for the majority of the scans
seen in all four networks. These would be the most common re-
sponses to a spoofed SYN-ﬂood (Denial of Service) attack. The
ﬁgures for the two UW and the Class A networks span the same

(d) Syn-Acks and RSTs in Class A
(e) Remaining Backscatter in Class A

the other components of backscatter besides the dominant RST, SYN-ACK’s.
two weeks. The backscatter in the two UW networks looks highly
similar both in terms of volume and variability. This can be ob-
served both in the TCP RSTs/SYN-ACKs and the two surges in
ICMP TTL-Exceeded shown in Figures 7(a) and (b), and makes
sense if the spoofed trafﬁc which is eliciting the backscatter is uni-
formly distributed across the UW addresses. The only difference
between the networks is that UW I tends to receive more “Commu-
nication administratively prohibited” ICMP messages than UW II.
We do yet have an explanation why. While we see some common
spikes in the SYN-ACKS at the Class A and UW networks, there
seem to be signiﬁcant differences in the RSTs. Another notable dif-
ference is that the Class A network attracts much more backscatter
in other categories, as shown in Figure 7(e).
The LBL graph shown in Figure 7(c) belongs to a different week
and displays a quite different pattern than that of UW. We note that
the backscatter in the UW networks for the same week (not shown
here) shows a very similar pattern as at LBL for the dominant trafﬁc
types (TCP RSTs/SYN-ACKs and ICMP TTL-Exceeded). This is
not surprising, because the two UW networks and the LBL network
belong to the same /8 network. On the other hand, the LBL network
seems to receive far fewer scans in the other categories.
