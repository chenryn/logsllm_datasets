User: I tried doing a "pwd" or cwd, after the cd, it does not seem to work when we use os.system("cd"). Is there something going on with the way the child processes are created. This is all under Linux.
Assistant: The system call creates a new process. If you do system("cd .., you are creating a new process that then changes its own current working directory and terminates. It would be quite surprising if a child process changing its current working directory magically changed its parent's current working directory. A system where that happened would be very hard to use.
