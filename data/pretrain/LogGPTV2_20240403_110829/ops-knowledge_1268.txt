User: I'm using cygwin on windows 7 to run a bash script that activates a python script, and I am getting the following error:
myscript.script: /cydrive/c/users/mydrive/folder/myscript.py: usr/bin/env: bad interpreter: Permission Denied.
I'm a total newbie to programming, so I've looked around a bit, and I think this means Python is mounted on a different directory that I don't have access to. However, based on what I found, I have tried to following things:

Change something (from user to exec) in the fstab: however, my fstab file is all commented out and only mentions what the defaults are. I don't know how I can change the defaults. The fstab.d folder is empty.
change the #! usr/bin/env python line in the script to the actual location of Python: did not work, same error
add a PYTHONPATH to the environment variables of windows: same error.

I would really appreciate it if someone could help me out with a suggestion!
Assistant: This seems to be a late answer, but may be useful for others. I got the same kinda error, when I was trying to run a shell script which used python. Please check \usr\bin for existence of python. If not found, install that to solve the issue. I come to such a conclusion, as the error shows "bad interpreter".
