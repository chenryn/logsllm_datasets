Question: You are tasked with designing a secure storage system for an Android device's hardware identifiers as part of an ID attestation implementation. Which of the following properties are essential for ensuring the system's integrity and security?
"A": "The storage must contain the original identifiers to enable the TEE to verify their authenticity during attestation.",
"B": "The storage should be tamper-evident to ensure any modification is detectable, rendering the attestation invalid.",
"C": "The `destroyAttestationIds()` method should be able to restore the identifier-derived data after a factory reset.",
"D": "RMA facilities must not have the ability to regenerate hardware identifier-derived data to prevent unauthorized attestation."
Answer: B
