User: How can I lookup environment variables (e.g. export HG_USER from .profile) using python code in Mac OS X?
Assistant: os.environ is a dictionary containing all the environment variables. You need to import os before you can use it.
So, for example HG_USER would be accessed by os.environ['HG_USER'].
