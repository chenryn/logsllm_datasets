**Migrated issue, originally created by Mehdi GMIRA (@mehdigmira)**
I encountred a bug with the postgres specific "DISTINCT ON" in SQLAlchemy  
The real SA query I'm using is more complicated than this, but it sums up to :
    query = db.session.query(c1, c2, c3, c4).distinct(c1, c2).order_by(c1, c2, c3)
when i compile the query by doing:
    query.statement.compile(dialect=postgres.dialect())
The actual query is
    SELECT DISTINCT ON (c1, c2) c1, c2, c3, c4, c1, c2, c3 FROM .... ORDER BY c1, c2, c3
As you can see, the columns c1, c2, c3 are repeated. After some investigation,
it seems like this is caused by the order_by() part of the query (removing
order by removes the repeated columns).  
The weird thing is that when actually running the query (query.all()), I only
get the column that I requested, and not the repeated ones as in the compiled
statement.  
This would have been fine with me. But the problem is it's preventing me from
using a union(), because SA thinks I'm requesting more columns on one side of
union().
I think It's a bug, but maybe I'm just doing something wrong.
