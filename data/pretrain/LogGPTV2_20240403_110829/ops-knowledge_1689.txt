User: How to setup SSH key authentication for added server security?
Assistant: Establishing SSH key authentication is an authentication method based on public key encryption, which can increase the security of the server. The following are the steps to set up SSH key authentication: 1. Generate a key pair Use the ssh-keygen command to generate a key Yes, this command will generate two files, the public key and the private key, and the private key file should be kept strictly confidential and not disclosed. For example: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 2. Add the public key to the server Add the public key to the server's authentication key list, which can be achieved by the following command: ssh-copy-id user@server This command will pass The SSH connection copies the public key to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file in the server. 3. Disable password authentication To ensure security, it is recommended to disable password authentication and make SSH only use key authentication. Modify the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and set the following options to "no". PasswordAuthentication no 4. Enable key authentication To enable key authentication, modify the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and set the following options to "yes". PubkeyAuthentication yes 5. Restart the SSH service. Restart the SSH service to make the changes take effect. These steps as above will set up SSH key authentication. In this way, only users who have the private key can successfully connect to the server, thereby protecting the server from malicious users.
