### Impact of P2P Traffic on Anomaly Detection

#### ROC Analysis for Different Attack Classes and Rates

**Figure 3: ROC Curves for Various Attack Classes and Rates**

- **NETAD (without P2P)**
- **NETAD (with P2.P)**
- **False Positives (%)**

The plots in Figure 3 show the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for different attack classes and rates. The performance of NETAD does not degrade significantly for flooding attacks when P2P traffic is introduced, but its accuracy decreases for port scans. In contrast, the Maximum Entropy detector experiences a more significant performance penalty for flooding attacks compared to port scans. This difference is attributed to the design principles of these anomaly detectors.

- **Flooding Attacks**: NETAD detects these attacks because they are launched on lower ports [Table 2]. P2P communication, which uses higher ports, does not affect the detection of flooding attacks.
- **Port Scans**: The increase in entropy and variance due to P2P traffic on higher ports results in a large number of false positives for the Maximum Entropy detector.

These results indicate that the impact of P2P traffic can vary significantly depending on the detection principles and features used by the anomaly detector.

#### Effect of P2P Traffic on Low- and High-Rate Attacks

From Figure 3, it is evident that the detection of low-rate attacks is more severely affected by P2P traffic than high-rate attacks. P2P traffic inadvertently provides an effective evasion cover for low-rate attacks. For high-rate attacks, the sustained connection rate can overwhelm the short-term P2P connection bursts, making the evasion less effective.

#### Training Anomaly Detectors on Datasets with P2P Traffic

**Figure 4: Performance of Anomaly Detectors Trained on P2P Traffic**

To determine if training anomaly detectors on datasets containing P2P traffic can mitigate the adverse effects, we developed training sets with varying proportions of P2P traffic (40-80%). We trained NETAD and Maximum Entropy on these datasets and evaluated their performance on the entire dataset, which includes all types of traffic (P2P, malicious, and background).

- **Maximum Entropy**: Training on P2P traffic degrades its accuracy and increases the false positive rate.
- **NETAD**: While there is an increase in detection rate, the false positive rate also increases by up to 30% as the amount of P2P traffic in the training set increases.

The main reason for this is that P2P clients communicate with each peer on different ports, making it difficult to define effective filtering rules for NETAD or derive a robust baseline distribution for Maximum Entropy.

**Conclusion:**
Training these anomaly detectors on P2P traffic does not mitigate the adverse effects, primarily because contemporary detectors are not designed to filter or incorporate the unique characteristics of P2P traffic.
