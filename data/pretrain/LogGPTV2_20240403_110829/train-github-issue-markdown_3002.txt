When I use `npm` to install `bootstrap` package, I want to be able to use
`require.resolve('bootstrap')` to get exact location (since it's not
necessarily in `node_modules` of my package) on filesystem. Bootstrap
`package.json` misses `main` section and `require.resolve('bootstrap')`
doesn't work.
I'm not creating pull request because I'm not sure about what file `main`
section should point to. Either `dist/js/bootstrap.js` or specially created
empty file like `dist/index.js` or even `dist/css/bootstrap.css`. Probably
something else, but something enough for `require.resolve('bootstrap')` to
work.
Thanks.
