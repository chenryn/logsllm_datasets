User: I was using ubuntu.
I found that many Python libraries installed went in both /usr/lib/python and /usr/lib64/python.
When I print a module object, the module path showed that the module lived in /usr/lib/python.
Why do we need the /usr/lib64/python directory then?
What's the difference between these two directories?
BTW
Some package management script and egg-info that lived in both directories are actually links to packages in /usr/share.
Most Python modules are just links, but the so files are not.
Assistant: The 64-bit version of the libraries?
What version of Python are you running? If you are running the 32-bit version, then you probably won't need those files.
