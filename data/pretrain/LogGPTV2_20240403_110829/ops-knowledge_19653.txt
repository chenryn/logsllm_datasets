User: Please introduce what is CI/CD and its functions and advantages, and list several common CI/CD tools.
Assistant: CI/CD refers to Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery), which is a software development process designed to achieve more frequent software delivery and more efficient team collaboration. Continuous integration means that in a team development, developers merge all the code into the central warehouse before the end of each day, and then build and test the code on the continuous integration server. Continuous delivery means that after the code is submitted to the repository, it is automatically built, tested, and finally deployed online. The role of CI/CD is to automate the software delivery process, thereby reducing manual errors and shortening the software delivery cycle. It helps teams test and deliver new features faster and improve software quality and stability. CI/CD also helps teams collaborate better, deal with issues quickly and release emergency fixes in a timely manner. The advantages of CI/CD include: automated construction and testing, improving efficiency; reducing human errors and reducing maintenance burden; accelerating software delivery, improving customer satisfaction; enhancing team collaboration and communication. Common CI/CD tools include Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI, GitLab CI, TeamCity, etc. Among these tools, Jenkins is the most popular open source CI/CD platform, Travis CI is a lightweight and easy-to-use CI tool, CircleCI is a container-based CI/CD tool, and GitLab CI is GitLab's own CI tool. With CI/CD tools, and TeamCity is a platform developed by JetBrains with both integrated development environment and CI/CD tools.
