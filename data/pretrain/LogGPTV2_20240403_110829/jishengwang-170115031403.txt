## About Niara
- Recognized leader by Gartner in User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)
- Re-inventing enterprise security analytics for attack detection and incident response

### User & Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)
**Why This Matters**
- UEBA is a critical tool for detecting and responding to security threats before significant damage occurs.

**How to Detect Attacks Before Damage is Done**
- UEBA solutions use machine learning to analyze user and entity behavior, identifying anomalies that may indicate a security breach.

**Building a Comprehensive Solution Beyond Deep Learning**
- Combining deep learning with other advanced techniques to create a robust and responsive security system.

### Security Landscape
| **Security Spend (Prevention & Detection) (US $B)** | **Data Breaches (# of Breaches)** |
|---|---|
| [Insert Data] | [Insert Data] |

- **Attackers are Quickly Innovating and Adapting**
  - With the rise of IoT and cloud, the security landscape is borderless.
  - Deep learning solutions must be responsive to these changes.

- **Insider Behavior**
  - Focus on behavior changes of internal users and machines to detect potential threats.

### User & Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)
**Key Features:**
1. **Machine-Driven, Not Only Human-Driven**
   - Automated analysis of user and entity behavior.
2. **Detect Compromised Users, Not Only Attackers**
   - Identify both external and internal threats.
3. **Post-Infection Detection, Not Only Prevention**
   - Detect and respond to breaches after they occur.

### Real-World Examples
| **Compromised** | **Malicious** | **Negligent** |
|---|---|---|
| 40 million credit cards stolen from Target’s servers | Edward Snowden stole more than 1.7 million classified documents | DDoS attack from 10M+ hacked home devices took down major websites |
| Stolen credentials | Intended to leak information | All used the same password |

### Real-World Attacks Caught by Niara
| **Scanning Attack** | **Data Download** | **Exfiltration of Data** |
|---|---|---|
| Scanned servers in the data center to find vulnerable targets | Downloaded data from an internal document repository, which is not typical for the host | Uploaded a large file to a cloud server hosted in a new country never accessed before |
| Detected with AD logs | Detected with network traffic | Detected with web proxy logs |

### User and Machine Behavior
| **User** | **Machine** |
|---|---|
| [Before Compromise] | [Before Compromise] |
| [Post Compromise] | [Post Compromise] |

- **Dropcam Example**
  - Before and after compromise behaviors.
