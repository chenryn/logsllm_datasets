MTTF value for the whole system model is very close to
the signalling system’s MTTF. Thus, we might conclude that
the reliability of these cyber components is the bottleneck of
building highly reliable train system. Relatively more effort
should be done on this sub-system such as frequent thorough
testing and maintaining of the communication system.
First, the introduction of redundancy designs, especially
the hot standby mechanisms used in the MRT system greatly
reduced the single point failures. However, there are still ﬁve
cases where a single device’s failure brings down the whole
system. These cases might not be obvious to the operational
management team when performing time consuming manual
Thirdly, existing tools are incapable of handling practical
industry systems even when we only model the core part of
the system. In particular, the shared sub-trees make the model
difﬁcult for decomposed computation. Manual decomposition
of the model is not a good option considering the complexity
of the models. Recent development of utilising model checking

generic, efﬁcient algorithms/ libraries and advanced state space

INDUSTRY PARTNER FEEDBACKS
We’ve hold several rounds of meetings to explain our
results to our industry partner from SMRT. They’ve given
positive feedbacks and useful suggestion regarding the next
steps of possible work.
•
Repairs For example, a non-critical hardware failure is
repaired before the system goes down. Thus, it should
be studied how the repairs would affect the overall
system failure probability?
VI. RELATED WORK
There have been a number of methods proposed in the
literature for qualitative or quantitative RAMS analysis of
cyber physical systems.
A. Question A- Result Validation
A. FMEA Analysis
Are these analysis results reasonably true from your obser-
vation of the system operation?
Answers: Personnel
in charge of TCSS and RSSS
replied in the afﬁrmative base on their observation of the
system operation. But the result for TPSS is hard to verify
since the estimated MTTF (8 years) is longer than the Circle
Line operation time which is 7 years.
B. Question B- Usefulness Feedback
Do you consider these analysis results useful? How would
you think this analysis would help the train service operation
and maintenance?
Answers: Original answer from TPSS staff-in-charge:
“Yes, absolutely these analysis results are useful. With this,
life expectancy of power equipment can be closely monitored
and necessary steps can be taken such as PM (Preventative
Maintenance) works, etc.”
In practice, SMRT follows the maintenance cycle suggested
by vendors. However,
is their vision to go into smart
maintenance which is to replace/ repair the faulty equipment
before it fails instead of performing maintenance in ﬁxed time
no matter there are failures or not. Thus, they think our result
could be a useful reference in deciding the PM strategy.
it
C. Question C- Future Direction
Along this direction of analysis, what problem would be of
interested to you and good for us to further explore?
Answers: Knowing that our analysis is based on man-
ufacture data and hardwares, staff from train service operation
management suggested the following areas for improvement.

Environment factors e.g., human errors. For instance,
operators may make wrong decisions that they allow
the train to go without checking if the track is clear.
Aging issues i.e., MTTF changes over time. Typically
in TPSS and RSSS, some hardware failure is repaired
on the spot that it is considered to have a shorter
lifespan than original. Although it is unknown how
MTTF changes over time for speciﬁc devices, there
are operational data/ maintenance records which can
be used for deriving the proper extrapolation.
Software problems i.e., the equipments in TCSS en-
counter more problems caused by software than hard-
ware. However, it remains a tricky issue to choose the
right measurement for software failures.

FMEA (Failure mode and effects analysis) [13] and its
extensions with security, FMVEA (failure mode, vulnerability
and effects analysis) [15], were the ﬁrst analysis techniques
which are still popular and used in the safety-critical industry
including defence [7] and railroad [5] domains. These analyses
offer a structured way to list possible failures, the conse-
quences and countermeasures. Results from FM(V)EA can be
useful for constructing fault trees, as they help in determining
the possible component failures and thus the basic events.
B. Fault Tree based Analysis
The FFTA (formal FT analysis) approach [11] based on
interactive proof construction is used to analyse a collision
scenario at the level crossing of normal long-distance railroads.
This approach proved the functional correctness of the
system and results in their paper showed that all minimal cut
sets of the model were single point failures. The TFT (timed
fault tree) [12] added delay to basic events and gates of the
FTs. Its application to the signal system of a high speed train
system enabled use of time as an attribute to evaluate the most
critical part of the system, i.e. most urgent operations to take
on system components, for example, calculating the minimum
time between a fault and an accident.
In other works, DFT approach [10] was applied to analyse
a major railroad crossing point in Netherlands. They adopted a
tool based on statistical model checking to reason a traditional
DFT model
i.e.,
repair strategy. Their case study experiments showed that less
possible repairs have marginal affects on the level crossing
system.
integrated with maintenance information,
Our work builds upon the above efforts with a tailored
application to cyber physical systems (we haven’t seen much
effort in analysing CPS) where the features of shared cyber
components complicate the analysis. Besides, as an industry
system, the size of the model places a big challenge on existing
tools, indicating that smarter algorithms should be designed to
raise the computation at limits.
C. Applications of FTA to Railroad Industry
There are a number of attempts to apply FTA or its
extensions to railroad systems. In [11], the authors used the
Formal FTA (FFTA) approach to analyse a collision scenario
at the level crossing of normal long-distance railroads. The
FFTA approach is able to analyse functional correctness with
interactive formal proof construction. The result shows that all
minimum cut sets of the model is a single point failure.

In [12], the authors used Timed Fault Trees (TFT), which
extended the SFTA with time labeled at each basic event as
well as the gates, to estimate the delays. They’ve applied TFT
to the signal system of a high speed train system. They are able
to use time as a metric for evaluating the most critical part of
the system, i.e. the most urgent operations to be undertaken
on system components. For example, calculate the minimum
time between a fault and an accident. Their result is also able
to help railway operators set the standard of maintenance.
In [10], the authors used DFTA to analyse a major railroad
crossing point in Netherlands. They’ve used a tool based on
statistical model checking to reason a traditional DFT model
integrated with maintenance information, i.e., repair strategy.
Their case study experiments showed the result

possible repairs have marginal affects on the level crossing
system.

VII. CONCLUSION
This work presented a data driven approach based on DFT
analysis to study the failures in the urban railway system,
taking Singapore’s MRT system as an example. The results of
this work can be used to analyse the reliability of train system
and provide support for deciding smart maintenance strategies,
so that relatively more efforts can be spent on maintaining the
operation of critical subsystems rather than individual devices.
In the work, we modelled the complex system features such
as the shared spares and functional dependency between sub-
models. The analysis results demonstrated that though the
system was less vulnerable to single point failures, the train
service was more likely to fail due to the low reliability in
the train communication sub-system. Thus, thorough testing
and maintenance of the communication system should be done
more frequently than that of other sub-systems. Feedback from
our industry partners is encouraging about the usefulness of
our approach and its applicability to practical settings. Our
work could be generic to most cyber physical systems, though
effective analysis tools are still insufﬁcient. For example, the
complete system model had a state space estimated to be 109
and the tool DFTCalc was not able to handle it.
This work also reveals more interesting problems to in-
vestigate in future, especially in the aspect of 1) replacing
the manufacture data with operational data such as mean time
between failure (MTBF) to improve the usability of the results;
2) comparing maintenance schemes and their consequent im-
provements in reliability of the system.
