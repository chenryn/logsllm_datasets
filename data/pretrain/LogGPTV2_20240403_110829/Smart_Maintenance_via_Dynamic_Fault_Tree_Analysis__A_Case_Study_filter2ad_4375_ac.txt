### MTTF Analysis and System Reliability

The Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) for the entire system model is nearly identical to that of the signaling system. This suggests that the reliability of the cyber components, particularly the communication system, is a critical bottleneck in achieving a highly reliable train system. To address this, more effort should be directed towards frequent and thorough testing and maintenance of the communication subsystem.

### Redundancy and Single Point Failures

The introduction of redundancy designs, especially hot standby mechanisms in the MRT system, has significantly reduced the risk of single point failures. However, there are still five instances where the failure of a single device can bring down the entire system. These cases may not be immediately apparent to the operational management team, especially when they are performing time-consuming manual checks.

### Challenges with Existing Tools

Existing tools are inadequate for handling practical industry systems, even when only the core parts of the system are modeled. The presence of shared sub-trees makes it difficult to decompose the model for computation. Manual decomposition is not a viable option due to the complexity of the models. Recent developments in model checking techniques offer a promising solution, as they provide generic, efficient algorithms and advanced state space reduction methods that can be further developed.

### Industry Partner Feedback

We have conducted several rounds of meetings with our industry partner, SMRT, to present our findings. They have provided positive feedback and valuable suggestions for future work.

#### Repairs
For example, non-critical hardware failures should be repaired before the system fails. It is important to study how these repairs affect the overall system failure probability.

### Related Work

Several methods have been proposed in the literature for qualitative and quantitative RAMS (Reliability, Availability, Maintainability, and Safety) analysis of cyber-physical systems.

#### FMEA Analysis
- **Question A: Result Validation**
  - **Answer:** Personnel in charge of TCSS and RSSS confirmed the validity of the results based on their observations. However, the result for TPSS is difficult to verify since the estimated MTTF (8 years) is longer than the Circle Line operation time (7 years).

- **Question B: Usefulness Feedback**
  - **Answer:** The TPSS staff-in-charge found the analysis results useful, as they can help in closely monitoring the life expectancy of power equipment and taking necessary steps such as Preventative Maintenance (PM). SMRT currently follows the maintenance cycle suggested by vendors but aims to move towards smart maintenance, where faulty equipment is replaced or repaired before it fails. Our results could serve as a useful reference for deciding PM strategies.

- **Question C: Future Direction**
  - **Answer:** Staff from train service operation management suggested the following areas for improvement:
    - **Environmental Factors:** Human errors, such as operators making wrong decisions.
    - **Aging Issues:** MTTF changes over time, and some hardware may have a shorter lifespan after repairs.
    - **Software Problems:** Equipment in TCSS encounters more software-related issues than hardware issues, but measuring software failures remains challenging.

### Fault Tree Analysis in Railroad Systems

- **FMEA and FMVEA:**
  - FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) and its extensions, such as FMVEA (Failure Mode, Vulnerability, and Effects Analysis), are popular in safety-critical industries like defense and railroads. These analyses provide a structured way to list possible failures, consequences, and countermeasures, which can be used to construct fault trees.

- **Formal FT Analysis (FFTA):**
  - The FFTA approach, based on interactive proof construction, was used to analyze a collision scenario at a railroad crossing. The results showed that all minimal cut sets were single point failures.

- **Timed Fault Trees (TFT):**
  - TFTs, which extend SFTA with time labels, were applied to the signal system of a high-speed train. This allowed the use of time as a metric to evaluate the most critical parts of the system, such as the minimum time between a fault and an accident.

- **Dynamic Fault Trees (DFTA):**
  - DFTA was used to analyze a major railroad crossing point in the Netherlands. The case study showed that fewer possible repairs had marginal effects on the level crossing system.

### Conclusion

This work presents a data-driven approach using DFT analysis to study failures in the urban railway system, with Singapore’s MRT as an example. The results can be used to analyze the reliability of the train system and support the development of smart maintenance strategies. The analysis demonstrated that while the system is less vulnerable to single point failures, the train service is more likely to fail due to low reliability in the communication subsystem. Thorough testing and maintenance of the communication system should be prioritized. Feedback from industry partners is encouraging, and our work could be generalized to most cyber-physical systems, though effective analysis tools are still insufficient. For example, the complete system model had a state space estimated to be \(10^9\), and the tool DFTCalc was unable to handle it.

### Future Work

- **Replacing Manufacturer Data:** Using operational data such as mean time between failure (MTBF) to improve the usability of the results.
- **Comparing Maintenance Schemes:** Evaluating different maintenance schemes and their impact on system reliability.
