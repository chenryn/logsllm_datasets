## Abstract
Permissionless blockchains, such as Ethereum, have gained significant adoption and economic importance. The complexity of these systems and the adversarial environment in which they operate necessitate a thorough understanding of their emergent behaviors and properties. This paper presents our experience from a one-month study of the Ethereum network, using multiple geographically dispersed observation points. We evaluate key aspects of Ethereum, including geographical dispersion, network efficiency, blockchain efficiency, security, and the impact of mining pools. Our findings include previously undocumented forms of selfish behavior and the exacerbation of geographical impact on block propagation delays by powerful mining pools. We also provide open-source measurement and processing tools, along with the collected dataset, to facilitate further research.

## 1. Introduction
In recent years, permissionless blockchains have seen rapid growth and garnered considerable interest. These blockchains enable cryptocurrencies and smart contract-based applications, promising to revolutionize financial transactions by eliminating the need for centralized intermediaries like banks.

At the core of most permissionless blockchains is a conceptually simple protocol, such as the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus proposed by Nakamoto [1]. Despite this simplicity, real-world deployments like Bitcoin [1] and Ethereum [2] are highly complex systems with various modules and protocols. Additionally, different client implementations and default parameters add to the complexity [3], [4].

The landscape of permissionless blockchains has evolved, with mining pools now dominating the ecosystem. As of the time of writing, the top four mining pools control around 60% and 70% of the total network capacity for Bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively [5], [6]. Understanding the behavior of these systems, identifying what works and what doesn't, and finding opportunities for improvement is crucial.

Recent studies have provided valuable insights into the performance of popular permissionless blockchains [7]–[10]. However, these studies often rely on single observation points, neglecting geographical distribution, and do not fully account for the dominance of mining pools [7]–[9]. They also overlook transaction commit times and the negative impacts of network delays, out-of-order transactions, and empty blocks [9], [10].

In this paper, we describe our experience and lessons learned from deploying a measurement infrastructure across different continents, focusing on the Ethereum blockchain. Our infrastructure consists of specially modified Ethereum nodes placed in North America (NA), Eastern Asia (EA), Western Europe (WE), and Central Europe (CE). We highlight the following key results:
- Identification of new forms of selfish behavior that harm the throughput of the main blockchain.
- Confirmation that geographical location significantly affects block reception times, with the prevalence of powerful mining pools exacerbating this effect.
- Empirical evidence suggesting that Ethereum's standard 12-block confirmation rule may not provide the strong probabilistic guarantees typically assumed in literature.
- Verification of some metrics from previous studies and reporting relevant changes to others.

Our main contributions are:
- A one-month study of the Ethereum network from multiple geographically dispersed observation points.
- Open-source measurement and processing tools for reproducibility and further research.
- A comprehensive dataset for additional analysis and refinement of our observations.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes our methodology, Section 3 presents the main results, Section 4 provides related work, Section 5 discusses lessons learned and proposes mitigation strategies, and Section 6 concludes the paper.

## 2. Methodology
### 2.1 Measurement Infrastructure
Our goal is to assess the emerging behavior of Ethereum in terms of geographical dispersion, network efficiency, blockchain efficiency, security, and the impact of mining pools. To achieve this, we created a modified Ethereum client based on Geth version 1.8.23, which is the reference implementation and the most widely used client, with over 74% of the user share [11].

The client was instrumented to log all incoming network messages, allowing us to collect information about incoming transactions, blocks, and peer connection requests. Each measurement is logged with a local timestamp. We collected 600 GB of raw logs and analyzed them using pandas [12] and NumPy for Python [13].

We added and adapted approximately 1,000 lines of code to Geth, maintaining its default settings except for the number of peers, which we set to unlimited. This configuration is consistent with the one used in Weber et al. [8], enabling a comparison of results. Our client behaves indistinguishably from any other regular client to ensure unbiased results.

### 2.2 Deployment and Specifications
The instrumented Geth client was deployed on computing instances located in NA, EA, WE, and CE. These instances were connected directly to the Internet backbone with a minimum network throughput of 8 Gbps. Table I provides the detailed specifications of the measurement infrastructure. All machines used the Network Time Protocol (NTP) for clock synchronization, ensuring offsets less than 100ms in 99% of cases and less than 10ms in 90% of cases [15].

| Location | CPU | RAM (GB) | Bandwidth (Gbps) |
|----------|-----|----------|------------------|
| NA       | 4x Intel Xeon 2.3 GHz | 15 | 8 |
| EA       | 4x Intel Xeon 2.3 GHz | 15 | 8 |
| CE       | 4x Intel Xeon 2.4 GHz | 8 | 10 |
| WE       | 40x Intel Xeon 2.2 GHz | 128 | 10 |

### 2.3 Propagation Delay Analysis
We adapted the method proposed by Decker et al. [7] to analyze block propagation delays. The propagation delay of a block is defined as the time difference between the first observation of the block at any measurement node and the times of arrival at the remaining nodes. This method is approximate and does not measure the time from the miner to the first measurement node. We considered NTP accuracy limitations in our analysis.

Measurements were conducted from April 1st, 2019, to May 2nd, 2019, with each machine connected to more than 100 peers. An additional measurement on the WE instance with the default 25 peers was conducted from May 2nd to May 9th to capture the behavior of an Ethereum client with default settings.

### 2.4 Ethical Considerations
Our deployment strictly follows the Ethereum protocol rules, ensuring no negative impact on the network. The data collected is publicly available and does not raise privacy concerns.

## 3. Results
During our one-month measurements, we collected data on 216,656 blocks (including forks) and 21,960,051 unique transactions, of which 20,654,578 (94%) were valid and included in main blocks.

### 3.1 Redundant Block Receptions
Table II shows the frequency of redundant block receptions. Blocks are more often propagated directly rather than via announcements. The median and mean number of redundant block message receptions is 9.00 and 9.11, respectively. Even the top 1% of most redundantly propagated blocks are received just 15 times. This is close to the optimal value of 10 (ln(15,000) ≈ 9.62), as shown by Eugester et al. [16].

| Message Type | Avg. | Med. | Top 10% | Top 1% |
|--------------|------|------|---------|--------|
| Announcements | 2.585 | 2 | 5 | 7 |
| Whole Blocks | 7.043 | 7 | 12 | 15 |
| Both combined | 9.11 | 9 | 12 | 15 |

### 3.2 Geographical Impact
#### 3.2.1 Geographical Position Influence
The Ethereum network establishes neighboring relationships among peers based on a random node identifier, independent of geographic location. Assuming even distribution of network capacity, nodes should observe similar propagation delays regardless of their location. However, we found that geographical position significantly affects block propagation delays, giving an advantage to miners in regions with lower delays.

## 4. Related Work
Recent studies have provided valuable insights into the performance of permissionless blockchains [7]–[10]. However, these studies often rely on single observation points and do not fully account for the dominance of mining pools or the impact of geographical distribution.

## 5. Lessons Learned and Mitigation Strategies
Our study highlights the importance of considering geographical distribution and the impact of mining pools in blockchain analysis. We propose several mitigation strategies, including:
- Implementing more robust mechanisms to handle geographical disparities.
- Encouraging decentralization to reduce the influence of powerful mining pools.
- Enhancing the standard 12-block confirmation rule to provide stronger probabilistic guarantees.

## 6. Conclusions
This paper presents a one-month study of the Ethereum network from multiple geographically dispersed observation points. We identified new forms of selfish behavior, confirmed the significant impact of geographical location on block propagation delays, and provided empirical evidence challenging the effectiveness of the standard 12-block confirmation rule. Our open-source tools and dataset will support further research in understanding and improving permissionless blockchains.
