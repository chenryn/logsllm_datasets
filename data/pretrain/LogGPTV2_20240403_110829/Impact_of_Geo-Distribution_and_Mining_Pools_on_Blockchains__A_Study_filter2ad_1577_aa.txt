Abstract—Given the large adoption and economical impact
of permissionless blockchains, the complexity of the underlying
systems and the adversarial environment in which they operate,
it is fundamental to properly study and understand the emergent
behavior and properties of these systems. We describe our expe-
rience on a detailed, one-month study of the Ethereum network
from several geographically dispersed observation points. We
leverage multiple geographic vantage points to assess the key
pillars of Ethereum, namely geographical dispersion, network
efﬁciency, blockchain efﬁciency and security, and the impact of
mining pools. Among other new ﬁndings, we identify previously
undocumented forms of selﬁsh behavior and show that the
prevalence of powerful mining pools exacerbates the geographical
impact on block propagation delays. Furthermore, we provide a
set of open measurement and processing tools, as well as the data
set of the collected measurements, in order to promote further
research on understanding permissionless blockchains.
I. INTRODUCTION
Over the recent years, permissionless blockchains have
enjoyed rapid growth and gathered remarkable interest. Per-
missionless blockchains enable cryptocurrencies and other dis-
tributed applications based on smart contracts that promise to
revolutionize the current payment methods with the ambition
to eliminate the need for banks or other centralized entities
acting as trusted mediators of ﬁnancial operations.
At the core of most permissionless blockchains lies a con-
ceptually simple protocol, such as the Proof-of-Work (PoW)
consensus proposed by Nakamoto [1], which speciﬁes the rules
on how the blockchain should grow and converge. Despite this
simple core mechanism, real-world permissionless blockchain
deployments such as Bitcoin [1] or Ethereum [2], are ex-
tremely complex systems composed of several modules and
protocols whose properties are intrinsically hard to understand.
To further complicate matters, not all implementations follow
the speciﬁcations, while different clients have different default
parameters [3], [4].
Additionally, permissionless blockchains have long evolved
from a plain organization composed of individual miners, to
an ecosystem dominated by mining pools. At the time of
writing, the top four mining pools have around 60% and
70% of Bitcoin’s and Ethereum’s total network capacity —
the top permissionless blockchains — respectively [5], [6].
Finally, they rely on a large code-base that includes different
implementations (and versions) of the software that blockchain
nodes and clients run. It is fundamental to see how they
behave, what works, what doesn’t work and opportunities for
improvement.
Recent work has performed measurement studies of popular
permissionless blockchains [7]–[10]. Together, these studies
have contributed to a better understanding of how these
intricate large-scale systems perform in practice, unveiling
some ﬁndings that were not originally anticipated [7]–[10].
Still, the general picture attained by these studies is inaccurate
and incomplete. This is mostly due to some key limitations:
(i) relying on a single observation point, therefore neglecting
how the geographical distribution of the network affects such
measurements [7], [8]; (ii) not considering the recent predom-
inance of mining pools as ﬁrst-class components in today’s
blockchain landscape [7]–[9]; (iii) ignoring transaction commit
time and how it can be negatively impacted by network delays,
out-of-order transactions and empty blocks [9], [10].
In this paper, we describe our experience and lessons
learned on implementing and deploying a measurement in-
frastructure across different continents, addressing some of
the limitations of previous studies. We focus on the Ethereum
blockchain, the second most valuable cryptocurrency.
We implemented and deployed a measurement infrastructure
consisting of several especially modiﬁed Ethereum nodes
placed across different continents. Our measurement nodes run
an instrumented variant of the Geth open-source implementa-
tion of Ethereum clients. Each measurement node can connect
to the main network and collect the desired measurements
from the transactions and blocks it observes. We analyzed
long-running measurements acquired by four measurement
nodes which were deployed in North America (NA), Eastern
Asia (EA), Western Europe (WE) and Central Europe (CE).
We highlight the following key results of our study:
• We identify the generalized and consistent practice of dif-
ferent forms of selﬁsh behavior that harm the throughput
of the main blockchain. To the best of our knowledge,
these practices were not documented and/or not empiri-
cally studied systematically before.
• We conﬁrm that the geographical location has a relevant
impact on block reception times and that the prevalence
of powerful mining pools exacerbates such effect.
• We provide empirical evidence that the standard 12-block
conﬁrmation rule of Ethereum may not provide the strong
probabilistic guarantees on block ﬁnality that are usually
assumed in literature.

• We conﬁrm that some of the metrics collected by previous
works still present the same values and report relevant
changes to other such metrics.
Our main contributions are the following:
• A one-month study of the Ethereum network from several
geographically dispersed observation points
• A set of open-source measurement and processing tools
that allows other researchers to reproduce our observa-
tions and/or perform similar studies in other blockchain
systems
• The collected data set which might enable other re-
searchers to do other ﬁndings in our collected data or
reﬁne our observations1 2

vides essential related work. §V describes the lessons learned

threats that our study identiﬁed. Lastly, §VI draws our ﬁnal
conclusions.
II. METHODOLOGY
In this section, we describe our methodology. Recall that our
goal is to assess the emerging behavior of Ethereum according
to several key aspects, namely: the impact of geographical
dispersion, network efﬁciency, blockchain efﬁciency, security,
and the impact mining pools have on each of these. To achieve
this, we created a modiﬁed Ethereum client that collects the
metrics of interest and deployed it over three continents. We
used Geth version 1.8.23 as the basis for our measurements.
The rationale behind choosing Geth in favor of the other
available client implementations is that Geth is Ethereum’s
reference implementation and the most widely used client,
with more than 74% of the user share [11]. The client
was instrumented to capture and log all incoming network
messages, hence allowing us to collect
information about
incoming transactions, blocks, and peer connection requests.
Each measurement is logged to a dedicated log ﬁle together
with a local timestamp. We collected 600 GB of raw logs and
analyzed them using pandas [12] and NumPy for Python [13].
Our modiﬁcations to Geth entailed adding and adapting
roughly 1,000 lines of code. We used Geth’s default settings
except for the number of peers we can connect to, which we
set to unlimited in order to observe as much information from
the network as possible. These settings are identical to the
measurement client conﬁguration used in Weber et al. [8],
which allows us to compare our results with theirs. Note
that, apart from the instrumentation effort and the number of
connected peers, no other changes have been made to Geth
— in particular, our client behaves like any other client in the
network and thus it is indistinguishable from any other regular
client. This is fundamental to obtain unbiased results.
The instrumented version of Geth was deployed in comput-
ing instances located in North America, Eastern Asia, Western

Europe and Central Europe. They were connected directly to
the Internet backbone with a network throughput of at least
8 GB/s. A detailed description of the speciﬁcation of each
machine can be found in Table I. These speciﬁcations are well
above the minimum requirements to run an Ethereum client
so we do not expect any biases due to poor hardware perfor-
mance [14]. Each machine used the Network Time Protocol
(NTP) for clock synchronization. NTP provides offsets lesser
than 100ms in 99% of cases and lesser than 10ms in 90% of
cases [15].
Part of our study involves analyzing propagation delays
in the Ethereum network, with a particular focus on blocks.
We adapt the method proposed by Decker et al. [7], which
exclusively relies on timestamps generated by our measure-
ment nodes to compute the block propagation delay. More
precisely, we deﬁne the propagation delay of a block as the
time difference between the ﬁrst observation of that block at
any instance of a measurement node and the times of arrival
on the remaining measurement nodes. Note that this is an
approximated method since (i) it does not measure the time
it takes to propagate a transaction or block from the miner
to the ﬁrst measurement node that received that block; and
(ii) the accuracy of our measurements is always bounded
by the accuracy of NTP. We take this limited accuracy into
consideration whenever relevant.
We performed the measurements from April 1st 2019 to
May 2nd 2019, with each machine connected to more than 100
peers at any moment. Additionally, we did a complementary
measurement on the WE instance with the default number
of 25 peers. This measurement was meant to capture the
behavior of an Ethereum client with default settings and took
place from May 2nd to May 9th. Ethical Considerations: The
machines and Geth client we deployed follow exactly the
Ethereum protocol rules and thus have no negative impact on
the behavior of the Ethereum network. The data we collected
is publicly available to anyone that connects to the Ethereum
network and therefore it does not raise privacy concerns.
III. RESULTS
In this section, we present our measurements and discuss
the obtained results in face of our expectations and also,
whenever appropriate, how they relate to other studies. During
our one-month measurements, we collected data about 216,656
blocks (including forks) with the block numbers ranging
from 7,479,573 to 7,680,658. On top of that, we captured
21,960,051 unique transactions out of which 20,654,578 (94%)
were valid transactions included in main blocks.
Our study focuses on answering a wide set of questions that
depend on distinct, yet cross-dependent, facets of the whole
Ethereum platform. We follow a bottom-up structure.

additional measurement node was connected to the default
number of peers (25). The results are depicted in Table II,
which shows that blocks are more often propagated directly
rather than via announcements. The median and mean number
of redundant block message receptions is 9.00 and 9.11,
respectively, considering both announcements and direct block
propagation messages. Even the top 1% of most redundantly
propagated blocks are received just 15 times. Eugester et
al. [16] show that, in networks with failures, it is enough for
the gossip protocol to disseminate information to a logarithmic
number of neighbors with respect to the total system size.
According to the latest estimation from [9], there are around
15,000 Ethereum peers. Therefore the measured mean of 9.11
block receptions is close to the optimal value of 10 (ln(15, 000)
≈ 9.62). This is further conﬁrmed by the low propagation times
analyzed in §III-B.
B. Geographical Impact
We now study the impact that geographic location has on
block propagation delays. This is important because, if some
region has lower propagation delays than others, that region
has an advantage when mining new blocks, as miners will
become aware of the latest blocks faster and thus can start
mining the next block ahead of miners in other regions.
1) Geographical position inﬂuence: The Ethereum network
establishes neighboring relationships among peers based on a
random node identiﬁer. This is independent of the geographic
location and therefore, assuming that the network capacity
(bandwidth and latency) is evenly distributed among miners,
nodes should observe similar propagation delays regardless of
their location. Regarding transaction propagation delays, we
did not ﬁnd evidence that they were affected by geographic
