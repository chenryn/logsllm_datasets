Hi, and first, thank you so much for your project.
This problem first appeared in my work project which is unfortunately private.
All my files was considered as ignore and appeared in grey in the treeview. I
took some time and finally succeed to isolate and reproduce it.
In a Git project, if a .gitignore from a subdirectory match a path from the
root of the project, the treeview will use the rule and ignore the path while
it's incorrect. Indeed, Git will not do the same mistake and the `git status`
will be different as what Atom show.
You can easily test on this repository I create to demonstrate the problem:  
https://github.com/Swiip/atom-git-tree-test  
The `test.txt` file inside the src directory should not be displayed grey as
it's not ignored in git.
If it's needed, I tested on a Mac with OSX 10.9.5, Atom 0.134.0, I tried
several times to delete cached files and it change nothing. I have no error in
the developer panel.
