Subject: Issue with .gitignore and Tree View in Atom

Hello,

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I recently encountered an issue in my private work project that I have managed to isolate and reproduce.

### Problem Description
In a Git project, if a `.gitignore` file from a subdirectory contains a rule that matches a path from the root of the project, the tree view in Atom incorrectly ignores that path. This behavior is inconsistent with how Git itself handles these rules, leading to discrepancies between the `git status` output and what Atom displays.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone the following repository: [https://github.com/Swiip/atom-git-tree-test](https://github.com/Swiip/atom-git-tree-test)
2. Open the project in Atom.
3. Observe the `test.txt` file inside the `src` directory. It should not be displayed in grey (indicating it is ignored) because it is not ignored in Git.

### Expected Behavior
- The `test.txt` file should not be ignored by the tree view in Atom, as it is not ignored by Git.

### Actual Behavior
- The `test.txt` file is displayed in grey in the tree view, indicating it is ignored.

### Environment
- **Operating System:** macOS 10.9.5
- **Atom Version:** 0.134.0
- **Steps Taken:**
  - Cleared cached files multiple times.
  - No errors were observed in the developer panel.

I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you need any further details or if there are additional steps I can take to assist in resolving this issue.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
