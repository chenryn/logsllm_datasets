to collaborate with. Also, this setup could make small players less
competitive, compared to big ones with better infrastructure and
higher influence to the market, because publishers could tend to
trust the latter ones. In effect, the Server-Side HB has re-enabled
the dominant players in RTB to regain control of the ad-bidding
process which was momentarily transferred on the user browser.
From the end-user’s point of view, this setup lacks transparency
and does not offer many insights on how the whole HB process
either works, performs, or what impact it has on the user’s browser:
all auctions are done in the background, at the ad server’s side. This
setup brings back the pros and cons of the typical RTB with ADXs
playing the crucial and controlling role in the protocol.
4.5 Hybrid HB
As its name states, this is a hybrid model that combines Client-Side
HB with Server-Side HB (Figure 7). In this model, the user fetches
the webpage which then requests bids from independent Demand
Partners (as in the Client-Side HB model). When the browser (HB
library) receives the bid responses, it sends them to the ad server
along with the available slots. The ad server then performs its own

auction (as in the Server-Side HB model) and picks the final winning
impression(s) from all collected bids (both from client and server
side). This model tries to combine the pros of Client-Side HB and
Server-Side HB, while avoiding their cons. It is a semi-transparent
model with a certain degree of fairness, which requires a moderate
degree of effort for the setup. Publishers can choose the Demand
Partners they will collaborate with directly, so they can know the
bids they are willing to pay. Also they don’t need to operate their
own ad server, so the programmatic effort is reduced to tuning with
the selected Demand Partners.
4.6 Facet Breakdown
The 3 facets of HB that we observed and described above, have the
following breakdown as detected from the HBDetector in the wild
(no other cases were observed that could comprise a 4th category).
We find that the Server-Side HB currently comprises the larger
portion of the market with 48%. Then, the Hybrid HB is second
with 34.7%, and the Client-Side HB is third with 17.3%. This means
that publishers prefer the centralization and control offered by a
server-side (or hybrid) model, which imposes a smaller overhead
and increases speed of transactions.
Indeed, the actors that provide both HB and waterfalling options
need to respect the protocols’ guidelines, otherwise they won’t
participate successfully in the HB process. Depending on the model
they are called to use in each auction, they have to use the appro-
priate notification channel and parameters to notify the browser.
As we will see in the next section, this highly skewed breakdown
towards server-side or hybrid is due to the presence of Google’s
DFP, which participates in many of these HB auctions.
5 ANALYZING THE HB ECOSYSTEM
Here, we analyze the data crawled in different dimensions:

son with RTB prices. (Section 5.4)
5.1 Demand Partners Involved in HB
As a next step, we examine the properties of Demand Partners
across the websites crawled and investigate who are the dominant
Demand Partners, how many participate per website, and how they
are combined together per webpage.
Who dominates the market?
First, we examine the popularity of each Demand Partner across
all websites. We define as popularity the percentage of sites that a
given Demand Partner participates in the site’s HB process. In total,
we find 84 unique Demand Partners. Figure 8 shows the 11 most
popular Demand Partners. As we can see, Google’s DoubleClick
for Publishers (DFP) is the most popular partner, with more than
80% of publishers utilizing it. The DFP can be used both as an ad
server and as a server-side HB solution. Thus, it is not strange that
most of the publishers choose this option over setting their own ad
server. We can also see that the list of top Demand Partners is full
of popular partners that can be found also in the waterfall standard,
as presented in past works2 [35, 41]. These companies have already
invested in the HB protocol and process early on, capitalizing on
their knowledge and market share in RTB, and most publishers
tend to choose these traditional big ad-partners over smaller ones.
How many Demand Partners are typically used?
A website can use more than one Demand Partner during the HB
auction. But given that the more partners used could impact the
loading time of the website, a question is what is typically employed
by publishers. The number of unique Demand Partners participating
in a HB auction are extracted from the incoming web requests
that trigger corresponding HB events at the browser, and detected
by the HBDetector (see Section 3.1 for details on the detection).
Figure 9 shows the CDF of the number of Demand Partners found
on each website. We can see that more than 50% of the websites use
only one Demand Partner. However, about 20% of the publishers
collaborate with 5 or more Demand Partners, and about 5% of
publishers collaborate with ten or more Demand Partners.
Which Demand Partners are typically combined?
Demand Partners can appear on a website in different combinations.
Given that we already identified 3 types of HB setup (client-side,
server-side and hybrid), it is interesting to see how publishers select
2AppNexus, Index, Amazon, Rubicon, OpenX, AOL, Criteo, Pubmatic, and Sovrn, which
match exactly what the industry claims as the top HB bidders in Aug’19 reports [28]

auctions. As expected, big DSPs like AppNexus and Rubicon hold
the highest shares, followed by Index Exchange.
5.2 Header Bidding Latency
In this section, we explore various aspects of Header Bidding such
as the imposed latency measured from different vantage points,
with respect to overall latency, publishers using it, number of part-
ners participating, etc. In all whiskers plots, we show 5th and 95th
percentiles, and the boxes show 25th and 75th percentiles, with a
red line for median (50th percentile).
How much latency does HB add?
The total latency of HB on a publisher’s webpage is defined as the
time from the first bid request to a Demand Partner (step 1 in Fig. 2)
until the ad server is informed and responds (step 3 in Fig. 2). In
Figure 12, we show the total time needed from the HB to process
the bid requests and responses. We see that the median latency is
about 600ms (point 1 in figure). However, some websites suffer a
much higher overhead. Indeed, about 35% percent of the websites
observe more than one second of latency, and as much as 4% of
websites observe more than 5 seconds of latency for the HB process
to conclude.
Based on our description so far, one might expect that a timeout
would be used during HB, to cut off responses from slow Demand
Partners. Although many of the wrappers use a timeout of 3 seconds,
publishers are able to set their own threshold by making some
changes in the wrappers. Unfortunately, our results indicate that at
least 10% of the websites exceed the threshold of 3 seconds (point
2 in Figure 12), and some even need 20 seconds before the HB is
completed (not shown in the figure for clarity of the other results).
Overall, even though most of the HB libraries strive to perform
HB activities in an asynchronous fashion, it appears that HB can
add significant overhead to a website if the library is badly tuned
and Demand Partners are slow to respond. In a recent report [11],
the average page load time (PLT) of a webpage was measured at
8.66 seconds, which is above the median latency measured here for
HB. However, the industry recommends that the PLT should be
kept under 3 seconds [11], which would lead 10% of websites with
HB auctions experiencing time delays above this recommendation.
Does publisher popularity associate with HB latency?
As a next step, we study the latency measured with respect to
the ranking of each website. Someone could expect that highly

10 seconds (removed for clarity).
different Demand Partners to participate in their HB auctions. We
should keep in mind that the mixture of partners selected can impact
the performance of HB with respect to delays and prices achieved.
Also, frequently selected combinations may reveal typical or unlike
competitions between Demand Partners. Therefore, we analyze the
common combinations of Demand Partners found on webpages,
and show the top 15 with respect to popularity in Figure 10, out of
753 possible groups of competitors found.
As expected, DFP holds a majority of the market on its own (i.e.,
appearing without any competitors) in 48% of the cases. Interest-
ingly, besides DFP which dominates the market as single-partner,
common groups of competitors include DFP in 51% of groups found.
Furthermore, Criteo and Yieldlab follow as single partners with
2.37% and 1.68%, respectively. Some popular pairs of competitors
include DFP and other companies such as Amazon, Criteo, and
AppNexus. Finally, some triples include the above pairs with added
entities such as Rubicon, OpenX, etc.
Which Demand Partners are used in each HB facet?
Given the three HB facets, we anticipate that some Demand Partners
and publishers will prefer one facet of HB over another. Therefore,
we analyze the participation of Demand Partners into each type,
in Figure 11. In contrast to Client-Side HB, which all the bidders
are transparent to the client, in Hybrid and Server-Side HB this is
not the case. For this reason, we analyze the responses from the ad
server (most commonly the DFP) to find the partners who won the

ranked publishers seek to have lower latencies for their websites,
and therefore add partners in their HB process who demonstrate
lower latencies. Also, higher-ranked websites may have available
more resources to use in their HB planning, which could lead to
reduced latencies and better performance. In Figure 13, we show the
latency of publishers vs. their Alexa ranking. Indeed, we find that
the highest-ranked publishers (i.e., the first 500 websites) exhibit
significantly lower latencies (median = 310ms), than the rest of the
ranked websites (median = 500ms).
Which are the fastest and slowest Demand Partners?
Figure 14 shows the fastest, top and slowest Demand Partners,
respectively. We notice many small or unknown Demand Partners
in these lists. The fastest (slowest) Demand Partners have median
values in the range of 41-217ms (646-1290ms). Interestingly, the
top Demand Partners with respect to market share have latencies
that are small, but not low enough to qualify them for the fastest
partners (with the exception of Criteo which has a median latency
under 200ms).
Do multiple Demand Partners impact HB protocol’s latency?
As we mentioned earlier, a publisher may choose to use several
Demand Partners at the same time. Although this decision may in-
crease competition for the ad-slots offered, and can drive-up the bid-
ding prices, and consequently the publisher’s revenue, it may also
increase the latency of the webpage to load on the user’s browser,
and decrease the quality of the overall user experience. Therefore,
we explore the impact that the number of Demand Partners can
have on the user experience with respect to latency.
Figure 15 shows the latency of websites vs. the number of De-
mand Partners each website has. We observe that publishers who
use only one Demand Partner have a small latency of 268.2 ms.
As can be seen by the second y-axis, this is the majority of web-
sites. Also, publishers with two Demand Partners have a latency of
1091.6 ms. Publishers with more than two Demand Partners have a
median latency in the range of 1.3-3.0 seconds. Does HB partner
popularity associate with HB latency?
Next, we study the latency of all 84 Demand Partners detected,
ranked based on their popularity in our dataset. In Figure 16, we
show the distribution of latencies observed per partner, when com-
puted across all the websites each partner was found. We observe
288

Publishers with more than one partner
tend to have higher page load times.

latencies with smaller variability.
that the most popular partners tend to have latencies with smaller
variability (up to 200ms), in comparison to the less popular partners
who may exhibit latency variability up to 500-1,000ms.
How many bids are late?
Here, we analyze the portion of bids that arrive too late to be
included in the auction. As late bids we define all the responses
about bids from Demand Partners which arrive too late, i.e., after
the request to the ad server is sent from the browser. Thus, it is
important to understand what is the portion (and number) of bids
that were received from the browser, that came too late and were
not considered in the HB auction. In Figure 17, we show the CDF
of the portion of such late bids with respect to the total number of
bids received at a website for the HB auction. We see that in 50% of
the cases with late bids, almost 50% of the bid responses come too
late to be considered in the auction by the ad server. Also, for 10%
of the auctions, more than 80% of the bids are late. In results not
show here due to space, we measured that in 60% of the auctions,
there was only one late bid, in 40% of the auctions there was at
least two late bids, and in 20% of auctions at least four late bids.
In Figure 18, we measure the percentage of late bids per Demand
Partner. We notice that 21 Demand Partners bid too late in 50% of
the auctions they participate. In some extreme cases, the Demand
Partner loses 100% of the bids they send. All these late bids point
to the possible loss of revenue from the publisher. This could be
the result of a poorly defined wrapper that sends the request to the
ad server the same time it sends the requests to Demand Partners,
without waiting for their responses first, as well as Demand Partners
that do not have the proper infrastructure to respond fast enough
to all incoming requests.
5.3 Auctioned Ad-slots
In this section, we investigate the properties of the auctioned ad-
slots, such as the size, the number of auctions per website, and how
this impacts the overall performance of the protocol.
How many ad-slots are auctioned per webpage?
We start by investigating the number of ad slots that are available
