### Table I: Ground Truth Dataset

- **No. of PCAPs**: The number of PCAP files representing a single infection episode.
- **No. of Hosts**: The minimum number is 2, as the smallest conversation involves a client and one remote host.
- **File Extensions (e.g., `*.pdf`, `*.exe`, `*.jar`, `*.swf`, `*.crypt`, `*.js`)**: These columns indicate the count (per family) of payloads with the specified file extensions. 
  - **Note**: Ransomware payloads can have over 45 different file extensions. We use `*.crypt` to collectively refer to crypto-locker file types in our ground truth dataset.
  - **Additional Note**: The `*.js` column shows the count of distinct JavaScript files (both local and remote), not all of which are necessarily malicious.

### Analysis of Enticement Strategies

Enticement strategies include:
- Social networking sites
- Ad banners with links to other URLs
- Legitimate sites with links to potentially malicious sites

The common aspect of these strategies is that the victim is tricked into visiting a specific URL. Understanding how the victim ends up on a malware site is crucial for determining if a malware infection is about to occur. We examine our ground truth dataset to identify the enticement strategies used in each infection. Specifically, we infer from the infection traffic whether the victim was:
1. Visiting a search engine site
2. Visiting a social networking site
3. Checking out a seemingly legitimate site

#### Search Engines as Primary Drivers of Infection Exposure
- **Figure 1** shows the overall distribution of enticement strategies used in exploit kits.
- **Search Engines**: Account for 62% of the enticement strategies, with Google at 37% and Bing at 25%. This distribution aligns with their market share.
- **Social Networking Sites**: Despite their popularity, less than 1% of enticements originated from such sites.
- **Empty Referrer Fields**: In 17.76% of the traces, referrer fields were empty, likely due to intentional removal to conceal the origin. An additional 7.51% of traces had redacted referrers, possibly to protect user privacy.

#### Weaponization of Compromised Sites
- **12.84% of Infections**: Occurred via compromised sites, indicating a rise in the use of vulnerable sites by cybercriminals.
- **URI Patterns**: We matched the URI patterns of 94 infected sites with those of default installations for commonly used CMSs (WordPress, Joomla, Drupal).
- **WordPress Sites**: 56 out of 94 infections involved typical WordPress installations.
- **Longitudinal Distribution**: 15 of the 56 WordPress sites were active over a 2.5-year period (June 2013 - January 2016), while 41 appeared within a shorter timeframe.
