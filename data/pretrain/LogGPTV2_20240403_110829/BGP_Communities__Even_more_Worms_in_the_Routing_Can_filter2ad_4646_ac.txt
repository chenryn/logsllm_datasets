### Centralized Redistribution and BGP Routing Information

In a centralized manner, the Packet Clearing House (PCH) redistributes BGP routing information to connected member routers. This provides BGP routing data for most Internet Exchange Point (IXP) members [52].

### Data Collection Methods

#### Looking Glasses
We utilize looking glasses of specific Autonomous Systems (ASes) when available to confirm:
1. Community availability and propagation.
2. Route changes.
3. Prefix reachability.

#### Active Measurements
We employ the RIPE Atlas platform [16] for pinging and tracerouting multiple targets during and after routing experiments. RIPE Atlas is an open, distributed Internet measurement platform with approximately 10,000 active measurement nodes. For studies involving traffic shifting and/or dropping attacks, we use traceroutes along both the expected and altered paths to assess the impact of the routing attack on the data plane.

### BGP Communities: A Preliminary Analysis

As an initial step, we measure the prevalence of BGP community usage. Our results align with previous observations [28, 29, 34, 36], indicating a significant increase in community usage over the past five years, as shown in Figure 3. Currently, more than 5,000 ASes offer community-based services, and our dataset from April 2018 includes over 63,000 different communities, representing an 18% increase from 2017.

Overall, we find that more than 75% of all BGP announcements at over 190 BGP collectors have at least one community set. This confirms the feasibility of using these collectors to study community usage and propagation. Interestingly, some collectors observe more communities than others. Figure 4(a) illustrates the fraction of updates with at least one community set for each BGP collector, ordered by increasing values for each of the four platforms. The large number of observation points allows us to study community propagation effectively.

We also measure the number of distinct ASes from which we see communities at each BGP collector, as detailed in Table 2. We observe more than 60,000 unique communities from over 5,600 ASes that are not directly peering with the respective BGP collector. This suggests that communities propagate beyond direct BGP neighbors.

Next, we examine the number of communities per BGP announcement, as shown in Figure 4(b). Recall that 75% of announcements carry at least one BGP community. Additionally, 51% have more than two communities set, and 0.06% have more than 50 communities set (blue dots). These communities are often (41%) associated with more than one AS (orange triangles), further indicating the transitive nature of communities.

### Propagation Properties of BGP Communities

To measure the extent of community propagation, we rely on the format convention: `AS:value`. Consider a BGP update for prefix `p` originated at AS1 and observed at AS5 with the AS path `AS5 AS4 AS3 AS2 AS1`. If the update is tagged with `AS1:X` and `AS3:Y`, we assume AS1 tagged the route with `AS1:X` since it is the origin AS. The second community, `AS3:Y`, could be either received by AS3 from AS2 on ingress or set by AS3 on egress towards AS4. To estimate propagation, we conservatively assume AS3 tagged the route with `AS3:Y`.

However, there are 21,000 communities of the form `ASX:Y` where `ASX` is not on the AS path. We refer to these as "off-path" communities, while the others are "on-path." Off-path communities can occur, for example, at an IXP where the IXP's AS provides the service signaled by the community but, by convention, IXPs are not on the AS path. Other reasons include widespread tagging (community bundling) to simplify configuration, as reported by Giotsas et al. [36]. Overall, Table 2 shows that 4,000 ASes are encoded in on-path communities and 2,000 in off-path communities. Among the off-path communities, there are approximately 400 private ASes [49], which are inherently off-path as they are not routed. They are often used by networks with large AS numbers that do not fit into the 32-bit community format. Thus, we focus on communities with public AS numbers.

Figure 5(a) presents an empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of the number of AS hops each on-path community is relayed along the AS path. The red triangles represent all BGP communities we observed. We find that a significant number of communities propagate multiple hops. Almost 50% of the communities travel more than four hops (the mean hop length of all announcements [51]), with the maximum hop distance observed being 11, which is relatively large given the highly connected AS graph.

To determine if specific classes of communities are more likely to propagate, we consider blackholing communities as a case study. We identify blackholing communities by the value 666 as defined in RFC7999 [47] or based on the list of verified and inferred blackholing communities from previous work [36]. The resulting ECDF is shown by the purple squares in Figure 5(a). The difference between the two ECDFs indicates that blackholing communities do not travel as far as other BGP communities. Approximately 50% of blackholing communities travel only up to two AS hops, and about 80% travel up to four. This suggests that network operators treat blackholing communities differently. However, we still observe some blackholing communities with large hop counts, up to 11.

To check if the above observations are biased by the AS-path length, Figure 5(b) shows the ECDF of the number of AS edges each community is relayed on for different AS path lengths. We do not consider communities of the monitor AS but include the edge to the monitor. The color gradient corresponds to the respective AS path length, from light green for a path length of three to dark blue for a path length of 10 ASes. This plot highlights that a significant number of communities travel more than 50% of the AS-path distance. However, as the path length increases, the relative propagation distance decreases.
