Atom crashes every time when I try to open it, from command line and from
dock. It crashes immediately after opening, I can't even see the window. I
have used atom in my computer few months with out any problem.
When opening atom from terminal it prints following message every time:
    LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed for the application /Applications/Atom.app with error -10810.
And OS X opens "Problem Report for Atom" window.
It contains following information
