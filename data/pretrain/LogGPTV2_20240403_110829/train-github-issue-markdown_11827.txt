 **TypeScript Version:**
1.8.2
**Code**
foo.ts
    var foo: number = "s";
tsconfig.json
    {
        "compilerOptions": {
            "module": "commonjs",
            "target": "es5"
        },
        "exclude": [
            "foo.ts"
        ]
    }
**Expected behavior:**
In an NTVS typescript console application using the above tsconfig.json, and a
file foo.ts containing an error, the build and run initiated by Visual Studio
should succeed because the file containing the error is excluded.
**Actual behavior:**
The build fails with an error in foo.ts. Compiling from command line, the
build succeeds. Also, if foo.ts is put inside a folder, and the folder is
listed in the exclude array, the VS build succeeds.
This is currently breaking projects using the typings tool, because it
generates two sets of type definitions, and the other set cannot be excluded.
