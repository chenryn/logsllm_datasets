first on the Social Security number because in doing so, I imme-
diately take the threat out of the scenario. Of course, I, posing as
Tina from HR, shouldn’t be asking for your SSN over the phone,
but I do so only after I’ve “proved” to you that I am who I say I am
by reciting your name and job title (which you will confirm for me).
That counts as two of my flags. In doing this, I build up some trust
and lend myself some credence. These are the cornerstones of rap-
port building. Rapport is a Swiss army knife for the attacker, so to
speak. It can help you persuade people to take actions they ordinar-
ily would not if the request came from a perfect stranger or from
someone they did not feel comfortable around. Rapport can divert
or misdirect the attention of an individual, too.
Misdirection itself is a form of deception in which you draw the
target’s attention to one thing to distract it from another. For exam-
ple, there are temporal misdirection’s of attention whereby you can
walk into location or start a call and be clear with the target that you
are under the pressure of time to get something done. The something
could be getting the database fixed, which you might need their
assistance with or it could be performing checks around a physical
location. As a network pen tester, it might simply be a diversion.
Whatever it is, it’s a lengthy departure from the real reason you are
making contact. Add rapport to the equation and you are even more
likely to find success.
Rapport can be struck up with something as seemingly insig-
nificant as creating a (false) shared experience: “I know we are all
flat out just now, so sorry to call this late…” or, my favorite, “I love
your name. My mum’s name is [Christine].” This works for me
specifically on the phone because I am quite soft-spoken and can
sound young, especially when I make you think of my mom, who is
definitely not called Christine or any other target names I’ve had to
date. Rapport can be developed many ways, but the level of rapport
is actually decided by the other person, not by you. If the other per-
son doesn’t really care that she shares the same name as my mom,
then I don’t get to act like she does. In vishing, developing a worthy
Attack Strategy 193
pretext, is the first step required of your AMs, but your AMs’s stay-
ing power should emerge during the call. It must never let you
break from the pretext, and everything you say must be steering the
way to the objective.
This technique doesn’t require that you should get down
to business and forgo all small talk. You can use rapport-
building techniques, and often rapport is the result of small
talk. To get someone to like you, you have to allow them to
believe you like them (no one ever said being an EA was a
clean game). You might employ an air of authority, but your
pretext will have to be pretty airtight to pull it off.
AMs applied to vishing relies most heavily on two things. The
first is agility for the good of the objective. Think through the call;
play that game of mental chess whereby you imagine all the sce-
narios you can— it will warm you up for the real thing, including
the chance that the target asks you details about yourself or your
job. The second thing is to never falter in the pretext you have cho-
sen. You must be acting exactly as your chosen character would in
a real- life scenario.
An average vishing call for my team lasts three minutes. They
are clear and effective in their approach. They get through hun-
dreds of calls in a day this way. I, on the other hand, have had calls
that last 25 minutes.
I got my target’s number from our internal list and dialed her
number, spoofing my own so that it appeared I was calling from her
workplace rather than my own. When she answered and, I’m not
being facetious when I say, she had the voice of an angel. I explained
who I was and was happy to hear her reply each time. A minute or two
into the call, I asked for the first flag, her user ID. The tone changed
immediately, and she tried for 20 minutes to verify who I was.
194 TOOLS AND ANATOMY
The real story of the call is that she asked me who my manager
was. I made up a name, which obviously didn’t pass her internal
checks; then she asked who my manager’s manager was, which due
to its fictitious nature also did not pass her internal check. Then
she asked me who my manager’s manager’s manager was. When
I again pulled a name out of my fake name generator, it was, in fact,
the name of a manager of a manager of a manager.
My target said, “Oh, Bob Smith! I know Bob, hold on.” She typed
his name into the internal database, and sure enough “Bob Smith”
existed but he was off this particular day. “I can’t verify with Bob,”
she told me with a hint of disappointment, given that we were now
about 20 minutes into the call. “He’s out of the office.”
“Really!” I exclaimed, feigning disappointment but feeling
relief. I really did not want to speak to Bob. Eventually, after her fol-
lowing all of her internal procedures and doing so as a professional,
we went our separate ways. I marked her name as “Shutdown” so
that when we sent the data to the client for the day, they would see
who within their organization was acting in the exact way they were
training them to. There was no need for me to mark it, it turned out.
Mere hours after the call, I was sitting on my living room floor
trying to get a kink out of my back when my cell rang. It was my
boss. Surely, he was calling to congratulate me, given I had heroi-
cally stayed on a call about eight times longer than our average in
order to gain a couple of flags. Negative. He was calling to let me
know our client’s substantial and prominent legal team had given
him a call to threaten ending the contract as one of his employees
had name- dropped a point of contact, an action that was strictly
forbidden within the terms of the scope. Not the most comfortable
conversation we’d ever had.
We were going to lose a very large contract—a nd I’d probably
lose my job— thanks to my using a very dad- like name. In picking
a common dad’s name in Scotland, at random, and giving it as the
third name I had made up for the call, not including my own made-
up name, I had unfolded all of this mayhem.
The next few minutes were spent getting my boss to believe
I had made up the name, which was an easy start given I had never
Attack Strategy 195
seen the contract, and didn’t know the name I’d inadvertently spat
out was actually a C- suite employee.
And I spent the next few hours trying to convince the legal team
that I had made the name up. We went through the call what must
have been 10 times, listening to me making up names and letting
legal ask questions about how I could’ve possibly arrived at such
a name at the drop of a hat. We also listened to what might be the
most epic response to a declaration of country, too. The woman
who had the voice of an angel also had the ear of a rubber chicken.
She was basically in need of a translator— she could not get her ear
around my Scottish accent, no matter how much I slowed down or
annunciated. About midway through the call I said, “I’m Scottish,”
as if that was somehow an excuse for my not having any presence
at her organization. Her reply: “I am sorry.” This, mixed with the
fact that I had no real way to know who was listed on our contract,
allowed the bank to forgive us, and we lived to vish another day.
However, the point remains: never break pretext, and stick with
the goal until you’ve exhausted every option and you’ve won or
been defeated in a valiant effort.
Smishing/Smshing
Smishing stands for SMS phishing, and it’s executed via the target’s
mobile phone. Many social engineering methods associated with
phishing are implemented here, too. You will typically still pose as a
representative or as someone familiar with the organization. Smish-
ing works best on individual targets, but there are times when the
organization at large can be targeted, too, as famously occurred
with the alleged hack of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos’s phone via a link
sent through WhatsApp.
I find these sorts of attacks to require short, sharp jabs of AMs.
An SMS phish need only inform the target of something, like an
account that is not operational, or give a call to action, typically in
the form of a link.
Smishing is largely seen as the least creative form of social engi-
neering, but getting a target to believe their bank or organization or
196 TOOLS AND ANATOMY
delivery service is legitimately texting them takes a fair amount of
AMs, for hardened targets, at least. Smishing, by all accounts is an
underrated vector, and they matter in the world of security Smish-
ing matters so much, not only because each time one is sent in an
organization’s name their brand is diluted and trustworthiness is
chipped away from a consumer point of view, but also because
each Smish puts their customers and employees at risk. Businesses
should be taught to think of Smishing the same way they do phish-
ing: a real threat with real consequences.
Make it personal.
Make it urgent.
Make it clear.
Make it concise: Because of this, do that for this, more optimal
and solution- based result.
The sheer number of variations on the term phishing may seem
extreme, but each represents a potentially catastrophic threat to
businesses and their data. But they also represent a way to show
an organization how easy and effortless it can be to circumvent
their defenses. As I said previously, defensive measures often lag
behind offensive measures because it is hard to tell the future accu-
rately. Even if security professionals could see how the future would
unfold, how their measures would be circumvented or brute-f orced,
they would not be able to see how the countermeasures would be
exploited. So, yes, defense lags offense. As an EA, your role is to
exploit the current shortcomings of a client’s defenses and allow
them a speedier, smoother road to defense and deterrence.
Impersonation
Impersonation is one of several social engineering tools used to gain
access to a system. Most often, impersonation tactics make use of
the human tendency to trust or obey. Impersonation can require a
lot of preparation and, depending on the person you want to imper-
sonate, you might have to get permission. It will have to be clear,
unambiguous permission, too.
Attack Strategy 197
I recently led my team on an exciting vishing engagement
in which we were targeting a prison service company. We were
allowed, per the scope, to impersonate internal employees below
the C- level, but one of the flags was a copy of some counterfeited
inmates’ criminal records placed within the system. For this particu-
lar engagement, we impersonated civil servants—n ongovernment
employees— a technique that was somewhat effective. We also used
the title lawyer for our pretexts, which yielded good results. Appar-
ently, people will give lawyers a fair amount of information, which
seems reasonable— a lawyer may need a copy of a criminal record.
However, when we were planning the engagement, we reached
out to a friendly contact within law enforcement to ask if we could
impersonate one or two officers. We were, in no uncertain terms,
told no. However, a real attacker will have no qualms about imper-
sonating an officer or anyone else who would help them achieve
their goals. Just like us, they use all the laws of AMs without the
rules of engagement.
Ubiquiti Networks, a manufacturer of technology for network-
ing, lost almost $40 million in a 2015 attack. After sending a phishing
email, the hackers used the technique of employee impersonation
to request fraudulent payments, which were, rather unfortunately,
made by the accounting department.
A lawyer, Richard Luthmann, chose a different course of imper-
sonation. He created social media accounts in the names of politicians.
He created fake Facebook and Twitter accounts that impersonated
political candidates and power brokers and set a myriad of small,
figurative fires. For example, he created a page about city council-
woman who talked about “SRO Welfare Hotel Full of Criminals and
Drug Addicts” that “she” planned to develop.
Luthmann was apparently unaware that any of this came close
to what could be recognized or classified as a crime, stating that he
was only engaging in “dirty tricks.” A special prosecutor disagreed,
and he was indicted on 17 misdemeanor counts, including iden-
tity theft.
198 TOOLS AND ANATOMY
You can play many roles as an impersonator. The ones I most
often come by are repair or maintenance, auditors, fellow employ-
ees, and system manufacturers. The list goes on; it’s only as short
as our imagination. Impersonation works best when you come in
full character, so to speak. If your chosen pretext wears a uniform,
you should make every conceivable effort to have that uniform.
The same goes for an authentic-l ooking ID badge. The less tangible
things you will need are knowledge that appears to be insider infor-
mation, such as jargon, technical data, and industry-i nsider terms;
names and details about employees; and details on the skills needed
to do the job of your chosen pretext. These tricks work because we
all regularly interact with people we don’t know. It’s commonplace
and acceptable to trust credentials—a badge or a uniform— and,
thankfully for you as an attacker, these things can be forged.
As a network pentester working in Australia, I was part of the
team that got to venture out as what I can now identify as social
engineers, but what at the time seemed like an inherent part of
being a network pentester. I got into a small industrial complex as
instructed, but my pretext was based on what would become one of
my best fails. My pretext was that I was Swedish, there to inspect the
machinery. The co- founder of the business was Swedish, and I was
acting as his ambassador.
To the culturally untrained eye, I suppose I could get away with
saying I am Swedish. However, as a man with stark white hair and
glassy blue eyes approached me yelling what seemed to be exclama-
tions of joy at seeing one of his countryfolk, I noted internally that
I could not fake knowing Swedish. Alas, it did not stop me from
trying. As our paths collided, he held out his hand, saying, “Hej
trevligt att träffas!” I replied, “Ya!” and quite enthusiastically, too.
(I know this because my whole team watched this scene on repeat
for about a week after thanks to iPhone’s recording possibilities.) He
then asked me some follow-u p questions, also in Swedish, which
was not ideal for me. Soon thereafter, he switched to English and
eventually had me escorted out.
Attack Strategy 199
He’d started out with, “Hi, nice to meet you!” and had quickly
moved to, “Okay, well, she does not work for the company, we
should call the police.”
Your pretext should be slightly more airtight than that.
Physical
In performing physical social engineering assessments as an EA,
you are a company’s capability in defending against unethical
attackers. A walk- through of how you executed your attack and
how you achieved the objective, or at least partially achieved it,
gives organizations a wealth of knowledge about just how secure
they really are, what issues they can fix, and what measures they
can take to fix those issues.
However, you also have to be aware enough to observe the paths
you didn’t take. For instance, on one engagement I could have
gained unfettered access to the facility where my client’s produc-
tion took place by jumping up onto the loading dock and walking
through the fire door that was propped open, taken the physical
keys left on the office table, and then enjoyed unrestricted access to
the facility thereafter. And I for sure had a look at that route, even
photographing it. The reason I didn’t take it all the way to its fullest
potential was, and this is not to sound arrogant, but it would have
been too easy. This client would have learned nothing of the actual
dangers. In just telling them of this observed one, they could easily
remedy it. Proving it seemed unnecessary and like taking a liberty.
Physical assessments are often seen as specialized, but they are
a growing trend, with many businesses seeing them as the next
“must- have” service. My hope is that these assessments are not
treated as special ops missions in all cases. As an attacker, you must
be able to confidently tread the thin line of what’s a substantial find
for your client and what is essentially special- operations theater.
There will be cases when you will have to get extremely tactical and
creative with your attacks. However, those types of attacks should
200 TOOLS AND ANATOMY
be reserved for the clients who are extremely well protected and
who will benefit from such extremes and creativity. Underwater
data centers that require physical testing is an example of this. Pro-
tected government buildings are another.
In a related, but different, topic, keep in mind that attacker
mentality doesn’t always point outward; it can also be introspective,
protecting us from doing things that will ultimately work against
our interest, such as taking illegal, dangerous, or unprofitable
actions. Such actions include stopping an entire group of people as
they walk toward you, who were almost oblivious to your presence,
in a bank you aren’t supposed to be in.
Back to the Manhattan Bank
As the words, “I’m Jeff and I’m not expecting any papers” hit me, I got
what is surely evolution’s way of punishing me for my trade—a nerve
rash that spread all the way up my neck and pushed out into patches
on my cheeks. I could literally feel my face heat up. I had no contin-
gency plan for this.
“Jeff. Hi. Diana. Sorry for turning up on such short notice!”
I said in my best impression of an apologetic lawyer and not an
imposter. I held out my hand for him to shake. “I’ve brought papers
from Sullivan’s for you to look over.”
“This is very unusual,” he said, not raising his hand to shake
mine. The group he’d been walking with dispersed around us,
grunting their goodbyes to Jeff. “My office is just down here; let’s
take a look.”
