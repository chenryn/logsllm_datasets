### 192 TOOLS AND ANATOMY

#### Establishing Trust and Building Rapport
When conducting a social engineering attack, the first step is often to establish trust. For example, when posing as Tina from HR, I would not immediately ask for your Social Security number (SSN). Instead, I would first "prove" my identity by reciting your name and job title, which you would likely confirm. This initial interaction builds a foundation of trust and credibility, essential for rapport building.

Rapport is a versatile tool for an attacker. It can persuade individuals to take actions they normally wouldn't if the request came from a stranger or someone they didn't feel comfortable with. Additionally, rapport can divert or misdirect attention. Misdirection involves drawing the target's focus to one thing to distract them from another. For instance, you might create a sense of urgency, such as needing immediate assistance to fix a database or perform checks in a physical location. This diversion can be a lengthy departure from the real reason for the contact, making it more effective when combined with established rapport.

#### Creating Shared Experiences
Rapport can be established through seemingly insignificant shared experiences. For example, saying, "I know we are all flat out just now, so sorry to call this late…" or, "I love your name. My mom’s name is [Christine]." This works particularly well on the phone, where a soft-spoken and young-sounding voice can make the target more receptive. However, the level of rapport is ultimately decided by the target. If they don't care about the shared experience, the rapport won't be as strong.

In vishing, developing a convincing pretext is the first step. The success of the attack depends on maintaining the pretext throughout the call and steering the conversation toward the objective. This doesn't mean forgoing small talk; in fact, small talk can be a powerful tool for building rapport. You might also employ an air of authority, but your pretext must be airtight to be effective.

#### Agility and Consistency
The success of vishing relies on two key elements: agility and consistency. Agility involves thinking through various scenarios and being prepared to adapt. Consistency means never breaking the pretext. An average vishing call for my team lasts three minutes, but I have had calls that lasted up to 25 minutes.

For example, I once called a target, spoofing my number to appear as if I was calling from her workplace. She had a pleasant voice, and I explained who I was. After a minute or two, I asked for her user ID, and she immediately became suspicious. Over the next 20 minutes, she tried to verify my identity, asking about my manager and their manager. When I mentioned a manager named Bob Smith, she checked the internal database and found that Bob existed but was out of the office. Despite following all procedures, she eventually ended the call. I marked her as "Shutdown," indicating she had followed the training.

However, this led to an unexpected issue. My boss called to inform me that the client's legal team was threatening to end the contract because I had inadvertently mentioned a C-suite employee. It took hours to convince the legal team that I had made up the name. The lesson here is to never break the pretext and to stick with the goal until all options are exhausted.

#### Smishing/Smshing
Smishing, or SMS phishing, is executed via the target's mobile phone. It often involves posing as a representative or someone familiar with the organization. Smishing works best on individual targets but can also target entire organizations, as seen in the alleged hack of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos's phone via WhatsApp.

Effective smishing requires short, sharp messages that inform the target of an urgent issue, typically with a call to action, such as clicking a link. While smishing is often seen as less creative, it still requires significant AMs to be effective, especially against hardened targets. Smishing is an underrated threat, as each message sent in an organization's name can erode trust and put customers and employees at risk.

#### Impersonation
Impersonation is a social engineering technique that exploits the human tendency to trust or obey. It often requires extensive preparation and, depending on the person being impersonated, may need clear, unambiguous permission.

For example, during a vishing engagement targeting a prison service company, we were allowed to impersonate internal employees below the C-level. We posed as civil servants and lawyers, which was effective. However, we were explicitly told not to impersonate law enforcement officers, though a real attacker would have no qualms about doing so.

A notable case is the 2015 Ubiquiti Networks attack, where hackers used employee impersonation to request fraudulent payments, resulting in a $40 million loss. Another example is Richard Luthmann, who created fake social media accounts impersonating politicians and was indicted on 17 misdemeanor counts, including identity theft.

#### Physical Assessments
Physical social engineering assessments involve evaluating a company's defenses against unethical attackers. A detailed walk-through of the attack and its outcomes provides valuable insights into the organization's security, highlighting issues and potential solutions.

During one engagement, I observed a route that could have given me unfettered access to a facility, but I chose not to exploit it fully. This decision was based on the belief that the client would learn more from understanding the observed vulnerability than from a full exploitation. Physical assessments are becoming more common, but they should be tailored to the client's needs, with more tactical and creative attacks reserved for highly protected environments.

#### Back to the Manhattan Bank
In a recent engagement at a Manhattan bank, I posed as a lawyer, Diana, delivering papers to Jeff. When Jeff said he wasn't expecting any papers, I felt a nerve rash spreading up my neck. I quickly adapted, introducing myself and apologizing for the short notice. Jeff, though skeptical, agreed to look at the papers in his office. This incident highlights the importance of having contingency plans and the ability to think on your feet.
