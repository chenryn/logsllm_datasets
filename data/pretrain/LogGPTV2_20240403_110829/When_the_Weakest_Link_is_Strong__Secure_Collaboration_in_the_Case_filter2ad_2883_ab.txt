### Systems and Security Experiences in the Panama Papers Project

This paper focuses on the 10 survey questions related to the use and security of the systems provided to journalists by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) during the Panama Papers project. These systems include Blacklight, I-Hub, and Linkurious. In addition to security-related questions, the survey also gathered information about the value of other services provided by ICIJ. For more details on the survey questions, see Appendix A.

### Interview Scripts

We developed two distinct but largely overlapping interview scripts for editorial and technical participants. Both groups were asked about their backgrounds, overall system experience, system functionality, training provided, any breaches or failures they were aware of, and the potential scalability of the system. Additionally, editors were asked about their methods for selecting and recruiting journalists for the project. The complete interview scripts can be found in Appendix B.

### Procedure

**Survey:**
- **Conducted by:** ICIJ
- **Period:** July 24th to August 15th, 2016
- **Method:** Google Form
- **Duration:** Approximately 10 minutes
- **Anonymity:** Participants could choose to remain anonymous or provide their name.
- **Data Handling:** ICIJ provided a de-identified dataset. No incentives were offered for participation.

**Interviews:**
- **Period:** December 2016 to January 2017
- **Duration:** Approximately one hour
- **Methods:** Telephone/online video/voice conference (four interviews), one in-person interview
- **Language:** All participants spoke fluent English.
- **Incentives:** None provided for participation.

### Data Preparation and Analysis

After completing all interviews, we transcribed the audio recordings, resulting in 96 pages of text. We used an inductive process to conduct an initial round of qualitative coding, identifying key themes through grounded theory analysis [19]. These themes were then refined through group discussions among researchers to capture the core variables of participants' experiences.

### Ethical Considerations

Our research protocol was approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB). Given the sensitive nature of the topic, we took extra precautions to maintain the privacy and anonymity of research participants. We did not request or publish details about security protocols that could compromise source identities, sensitive information, or future work. All interview participants agreed to be audio recorded, and the recordings were stored and transmitted only in encrypted form. De-identified transcripts were used for most data analysis.

### Results

#### Survey Results

The survey data analyzed below is a summary of the un-redacted responses (n=118) and comments (n=57) from 118 journalist contributors who completed the ICIJ survey. Representative comments are included where relevant, identified using a letter (J for journalist) and participant number.

##### Prior Familiarity with Security Practices

Almost half of the participants indicated that they were "Unaware" of or had "Never" used PGP or two-factor authentication before the project (47% and 45%, respectively). Familiarity with passphrases was somewhat higher, with 31% reporting they were "Unaware" or had "Never" used a passphrase. More than half (52%) frequently used passphrases, while 42% frequently used two-factor authentication. Only 25% reported frequent use of PGP prior to the project. Despite limited familiarity, ICIJ mandated PGP for all collaborators, which we discuss further in Section 5.

##### Perceived Difficulty of Security Compliance

Participants rated the difficulty of complying with security requirements on a seven-point scale from 1 ("Super easy") to 7 ("Extremely Hard"). The overall mean rating was 3.13, with the majority (63%) rating it as "easy." Only 10% of participants (12/118) rated the difficulty as extremely hard ("7": 3% or "6": 7%).

| Rating | Percentage |
|--------|------------|
| 1      | 15%        |
| 2      | 31%        |
| 3      | 17%        |
| 4      | 14%        |
| 5      | 13%        |
| 6      | 7%         |
| 7      | 3%         |

##### Perceived Utility of ICIJ Technology Services

The majority of participants (83% for data and tools, 78% for coordination) reported that the technology was essential. While only 43% found the training essential, 95% rated it as at least "useful."

| Service     | Unnecessary | Not Useful | Useful | Very Useful | Essential |
|-------------|-------------|------------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Data        | 0%          | 0%         | 4%     | 13%         | 83%       |
| Coordination| 0%          | 0%         | 8%     | 14%         | 78%       |
| Tools       | 0%          | 0%         | 4%     | 13%         | 83%       |
| Training    | 2%          | 3%         | 23%    | 29%         | 43%       |

##### Frequency of Use of ICIJ Technologies

- **Blacklight:** 64% used it daily, 33% weekly, and 3% monthly.
- **I-Hub:** 89% used it daily or weekly, 8% monthly, and 3% never.
- **Linkurious:** 19% never used it, 31% monthly, 45% weekly, and 4% daily.

##### Collaboration Outside Home Organization

Participants rated their collaboration outside their organization on a scale of 1 to 7. Nearly one-third (32%) indicated they collaborated "more than ever," and the vast majority (74%) responded positively (mean rating of 5.33).

| Rating | Percentage |
|--------|------------|
| 1      | 3%         |
| 2      | 4%         |
| 3      | 6%         |
| 4      | 14%        |
| 5      | 25%        |
| 6      | 17%        |
| 7      | 32%        |

##### Contributor Suggestions about Security

Fifty-seven contributors provided open-ended feedback. Common themes included feature requests (14%), compliments (13%), affirming the need for security (5%), and requests for additional training (4%). Only 3% described the security requirements as a barrier to work.

For example:
- **J118:** "The Google Authenticator tool... when I changed my phone (twice during the investigation) I had to communicate with the support team to reboot the passwords."
- **J68:** "At certain times security turned into a barrier into getting more done... Every time a cellphone died or went missing (frequently) I needed to reconfigure authentication."
- **J78:** "Itâ€™s always a pain and even slowed us down. But this work is important and anything to keep it secure is fine."
- **Another participant:** "I like the fact that ICIJ considers security as a priority. Maybe ICIJ can explore other ways to..."

### Conclusion

The survey and interview results highlight the effectiveness and perceived ease of the security measures implemented by ICIJ during the Panama Papers project. Despite initial unfamiliarity with some security practices, journalists found the systems useful and manageable, underscoring the importance of user-friendly security solutions in collaborative journalism.
