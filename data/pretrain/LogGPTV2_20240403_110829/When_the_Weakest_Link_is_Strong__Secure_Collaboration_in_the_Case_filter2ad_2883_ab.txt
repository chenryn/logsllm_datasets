light, I-Hub, and Linkurious systems used during the
Panama Papers project, as well as their experiences with
the security of these systems.
In this paper, we focus
on the 10 survey questions related to the use and secu-
rity of the systems provided to journalists by ICIJ (see
Appendix A). In addition to these security-related ques-
tions, the survey also captured information about the
value to journalists of other services provided by ICIJ.
Interview Scripts. We created two distinct, but mostly
overlapping interview scripts for the editorial and tech-
nical interview participants. Topics for both groups
included questions about the participants’ background,
their experience with the overall system, system func-
tionality, any training they offered as part of the project,
any breaches or failures they were aware of, and the po-
tential scalability of the system. Additionally, we asked
editors about how they selected and recruited journalists
for project participation. Please see Appendix B for the
complete interview scripts.
3.3 Procedure
Survey. The survey was conducted between July 28th
and August 15th, 2016 by the ICIJ. Participants com-
pleted the survey via a Google form and took around 10
minutes to complete. Participants could choose to an-
swer the survey anonymously or provide their name if
they wished. ICIJ provided us with the survey responses
as a de-identiﬁed dataset. Participants were not provided
an incentive to take the survey.
Interview. We interviewed participants between Decem-
ber 2016 and January 2017. Interviews typically lasted
about one hour and were conducted via telephone/online
video/voice conference (four), with one taking place in
person. All participants spoke ﬂuent English and were
interviewed in English. Participants were not provided
an incentive to participate in the interview.
3.4 Data Preparation and Analysis
Once all interviews were complete, we transcribed the
audio recordings, producing 96 pages of text. Using an
inductive process we completed an initial round of qual-
itative coding to identify key themes, as substantive cat-
egories emerged from the data via grounded theory anal-
ysis [19]. These themes were then evaluated and reﬁned
through group discussion among all researchers, with a
goal of capturing the core variables constituting our par-
ticipants’ experiences.
3.5 Ethical Considerations
Our entire protocol was IRB approved. Furthermore,
because of the sensitive nature of our interview topic,
we took extra precautions to maintain the privacy and
anonymity of research participants. We explicitly did not
request information about or publish details about secu-
rity protocols that could compromise source identities,
sensitive information, or future work.
All interview participants agreed to be audio recorded
during the interview and answered all of the questions
in the interview script. We stored and transmitted audio
recordings only in encrypted form and used de-identiﬁed
transcripts for the majority of the data analysis.

4 Results
In this section, we present results from the survey and
semi-structured interviews.
4.1 Survey Results
Apart from de-identiﬁcation, the survey data analyzed
below is a summary of
the un-redacted responses
(n=118) and comments (n=57) from the 118 journalist
contributors who completed the ICIJ survey. Where rel-
evant, we have included representative comments along-
side the survey results. We identify quotes using only a
letter (J for journalist) and participant number.
4.1.1 Prior Familiarity with Security Practices
The challenge of meeting security goals when work-
ing with non-expert users has been widely documented
(e.g. [8]). To evaluate the signiﬁcance of the Panama Pa-
pers project as a “security success story,” we analyzed
survey results to determine whether prior security exper-
tise of the journalist contributors may have been a factor.
In fact, in response to a question about prior familiarity
with digital security practices (see Table 1), almost half
of participants indicated that they were “Unaware” of or
had “Never” used PGP or two-factor authentication prior
to this project (47% and 45% respectively).
Familiarity with passphrases (i.e., passwords created
by concatenating multiple dictionary words, along the
lines of [52]) was somewhat greater, with only about a
third (31%) reporting that they were “Unaware” of or had
“Never” used a passphrase. More than half (52%) of par-
ticipants reported that they frequently used a passphrase
prior to participation in this project, while 42% reported
they frequently used two-factor authentication. Only
one-quarter (25%) reported that they frequently used
PGP prior to participation in the Panama Papers project.
Given journalists’ limited familiarity with strong secu-
rity practices prior to the Panama Papers project, we note
that ICIJ’s decision to mandate PGP for all collaborators
is especially striking. We discuss the implications of this
further in Section 5.
4.1.2 Perceived Difﬁculty of Security Compliance
Each of the three primary systems journalists used for
this project —Blacklight, I-Hub, and Linkurious—had a
distinct login that required two-factor authentication for
every sign-on. Moreover, every journalist on the project
was required to use PGP for password-reset and some
system notiﬁcations. Despite relatively limited prior ex-
posure to some of these security practices, however, par-
ticipants reported that they perceived it to be relatively
easy to comply with these requirements.
On a seven-point scale from 1 (“Super easy”) to 7
(“Extremely Hard”), participants’ overall mean rating
was 3.13 (see Table 2), with the majority (63%) rating

Table 2: Perceived Difﬁculty of Security Compliance
(N=118). On a scale from 1 - 7, where 1 is “Super easy” and
7 is “Extremely hard”, how challenging was it to comply with
the digital security requirements?
compliance with the security requirements on the “easy”
side of the scale. As one participant put it:
I am kind of technologically challenged, so the
fact that I was able to navigate these security
features means it was probably as simple as it
could be while still being effective. (J11)
Meanwhile, only 10% of participants (12/118) rated
the difﬁculty of complying with security practices as ex-
tremely hard (“7”: 3% or “6”: 7%).
Participants’ low difﬁculty ratings of complying with
these security requirements is especially surprising given
that they include use of PGP, which prior work indicates
is notoriously difﬁcult to use (e.g., [40, 60]). We dis-
cuss possible explanations for these results—including
the participants’ trust in the team leading the project—in
subsequent sections.
4.1.3 Perceived Utility of ICIJ Technology Services
Research indicates that motivation can play a signiﬁcant
role in the adoption of security practices in organizations
(e.g., [23, 54]), and is increased if users ﬁnd a system
useful—or even necessary—to achieving their primary
work objectives [57].
When rating the utility/necessity of the technology
services provided by ICIJ (summarized in Table 3), the
vast majority of participants reported that the technology
was essential (83% for data and tools and 78% for co-
ordination). Though less than half of participants (43%)
reported that the training was essential, almost all partic-
ipants (95%) rated the training as at least “useful.” None
of the 5% of journalist-contributors who did not ﬁnd the
training useful commented on the training, though others
did comment speciﬁcally on their interest in additional
training. For example:
I would like to receive more training at digital
security tools. It was really useful. I learned
for myself how to encrypt my computer and
ﬁnd out how vulnerable was my information,
due to my lack of expertise using digital secu-
rity tools. (J81)

tion; “monthly” includes responses “every now and then.”
4.1.4 Frequency of Use of ICIJ Technologies
In order to assess how well contributors’ reported useful-
ness of the ICIJ systems matched their actual behaviors,
we analyzed survey data on how frequently journalists
used Blacklight, I-Hub, and Linkurious (see Figures 1-
3). These results are summarized in Table 4.
The majority of respondents (64%) indicated that
they used Blacklight—the document-search platform
where contributing journalists could access the leaked
documents—at least daily during the three months prior
to the project launch date in April 2016. One third (33%)
used Blacklight at least weekly, and only 3% used it
monthly.
The vast majority of respondents (89%) used I-Hub—
the collaboration and communication platform with fo-
rum and chat features—daily or weekly. Only 8% used
I-Hub only monthly, while just 3% reported never having
used it.
By contrast, a signiﬁcant portion (19%) of respondents
indicated they had never used Linkurious—the system
that provided visual graphs of the relationships between
entities mentioned in the leaked documents. About a
third (31%) said they used it monthly and nearly a half
said they used it weekly. Only 4% used it daily.
4.1.5 Collaboration Outside Home Organization
A key objective for ICIJ in facilitating the Panama Papers
project was to encourage inter-organizational collabo-
ration among participating journalists, to maximize the
quality and impact of the resulting publications. The de-
gree of collaboration therefore offers insight into both the
utility and usability of these systems. Given the global
distribution of the journalist-contributors, collaborative
data management strategies like using local-only servers
or in-person meetings, were not feasible. These circum-
stances therefore also gave rise to speciﬁc technical secu-
rity requirements for inter-organizational collaboration.
Survey participants were asked to rate how much they
collaborated outside of their own organization on a scale
of 1 - 7 (where 1 indicated “I worked independently” and
7 indicated “I’ve collaborated more than ever”). Nearly
one third (32%) of participants indicated they had collab-
orated with journalists outside their organization “more
than ever” during the Panama Papers project, and the vast
majority of participants (74%) responded on the positive
side of the scale (5, 6, or 7), with a mean rating of 5.33.
Only 13% indicating lower levels of inter-organizational
collaboration by responding on the negative side of the
scale (1, 2, or 3). This data is summarized in Table 5.
4.1.6 Contributor Suggestions about Security
The survey data we analyzed also included one open-
ended question: “Do you have any suggestions or com-
ments about the digital security tools and requirements
for this project?” Fifty-seven contributors offered open-
ended feedback. While the themes of these comments
varied, the most frequent theme was a feature request
(14% total, of which more than half were requests for
additional security features). The second most common
themes were compliments (13%), statements afﬁrming
the need for security (5%), and requests for additional
training (4%). Notably, only 3% of comments described
the project’s security requirements as a barrier to work.
For example, several participants (5) speciﬁcally men-
tioned issues around phone-based authentication.
The Google Authentiﬁcator [sic] tool... when
I changed my phone (twice during the investi-
gation) I had to communicate with the support
team to reboot the passwords. (J118)
At certain times security turned into a bar-
rier into getting more done... Every time a
cellphone died or went missing (frequently) I
needed to reconﬁgure authentication. (J68)
However, another participant noted that while security
was a barrier, it was worth the slow-down:
It’s always a pain and even slowed us down.
But this work is important and anything to
keep it secure is ﬁne. (J78)
Finally, others explicitly called-out the need for secu-
rity and even praised ICIJ’s focus on it:
I like the fact that ICIJ considers security as a
priority. Maybe ICIJ can explore other ways to
