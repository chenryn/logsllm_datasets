User: I am trying to convert a python script to an executable file.
I have tried cxFreeze and py2exe, but both told me that Python27 are not in the registry. I found several other questions that tell me to go to regedit and find the python folder, but it is not there. I tried going to HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software and Python27 was not there. 
Do I need to add it there to run the installer for cxFreeze or py2exe or is there another way?
Assistant: I fixed the issue. Apparently I accidentally installed 32-bit Python on a 64-bit machine. So I have to use the 32-bit installer because it installs the registry key in a different place. Thanks for the help anyways.
