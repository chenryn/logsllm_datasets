User: I'm writing Python code using Vim inside Terminal (typing command "vim" to start up Vim).  I've been trying to find a way to execute the code through the mac terminal in the same window.
I'm trying to use :!python % but I get the following error message:
E499: Empty file name for '%' or '#', only works with ":p:h"
Anyone have any suggestions?
Assistant: in vim type :w yourfilenamehere.py and press enter
