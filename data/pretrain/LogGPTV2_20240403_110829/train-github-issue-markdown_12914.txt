#### Describe the workflow you want to enable
I have been searching around for a Scikit-learn package which calculates the
specificity score for multiclass problems but I can't seem to find one.
Would be helpful to have a package which calculates the specificity score, in
particular for multiclass problems.
Would be helpful to also have a scorer call for the specificity score so that
the scorer call could be used in other functions like `cross_val_score()` or
`GridSearchCV()`. See here: https://scikit-
learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html
#### Additional context
If Scikit-learn decided not to have a package to calculate the specificity
score for multiclass problems, is there a reason why this was omitted?
Alternatively, if I really need to calculate the specificity score for
multiclass problems at this point in time, what is the best way in doing so,
in particular calculating the specificity score (for multiclass problems)
together using `GridSearchCV()`.
