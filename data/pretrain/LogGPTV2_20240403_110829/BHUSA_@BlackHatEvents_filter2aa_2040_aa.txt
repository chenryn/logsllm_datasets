Conclusions
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
Information Classification: General
What is IAM?
The integration of Identity and Access Management into a single solution.
Identity (Authentication)
The validation that I am who I say I am. Typically this is done with password authentication 
and federated authentication such as Single Sign On (SSO) technology
• Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
Access (Authorization)
The verification of privileges or permissions to a given resource from an already 
authenticated user.
• Open Authorization (OAuth2)
• Java Web Token (JWT) for data exchange

What is IAM?
Its a prime target to attackers!
1. Full control of authentication and authorization
2. Must be externally exposed on the perimeter
3. Must use complicated technology stacks and protocols
Breaching an IAM on a perimeter means breaching 
several other systems controlled by the organization!

Vulnerability Types
Authentication - Server-side attacks
• XML Token parsing (XXE, SSRF, XSLT etc.)
• Signature verification bypass (XSW, XML Canonicalization, etc.)
These are server-side attacks that target either the IdP or SP directly.
Authorization - Client-side attacks
• Access token/authorization code leaks (XSS, CSRF, Open Redirect, Click Jacking, etc.)
These are typically client-side attacks that attempt to leak sensitive data.
Past Attacks 
Against IAM Solutions
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
Information Classification: General
Oracle Access Manager (OAM)
This is Oracles flagship IAM solution and comes bundled with Oracle's WebLogic AS.
ForgeRock OpenAM
Originally called OpenSSO, OpenAM is a fork of OpenSSO and was maintained and 
developed as an open-source project by ForgeRock. 
In 2016 it was renamed to ForgeRock AM and became a closed source offering.
VMWare Workspace ONE Access
Formally known as VMWare Identity Manager (vIDM) is VMWare's flagship IAM solution 
and is relatively new yet still used by several Fortune 500 companies.

CVE-2021-35587
Oracle Access Manager Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Discovered by Jang and Peterjson
Limitations of the vulnerability:
• None
OAM 11g impacted but is EOL and the OAM 12g with the latest patches isn't affected due 
to the removal of the vulnerable endpoint. 
Nothing for Oracle to do!

Questions:
• Do we need to escape the Freemarker sandbox?
• Can we find a thrown Exception containing attacker-controlled data?
Spring MVC configuration is typically performed in code. 
The configuration can be found in the 
endusercatalog.ui.config.WebConfig class.
