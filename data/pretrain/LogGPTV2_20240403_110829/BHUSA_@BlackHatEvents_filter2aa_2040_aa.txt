### What is IAM?
**Identity and Access Management (IAM)** integrates authentication and authorization into a single solution.

- **Identity (Authentication)**
  - Validation that the user is who they claim to be.
  - Typically done via password authentication and federated authentication (e.g., Single Sign-On (SSO)).
  - Examples: Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)

- **Access (Authorization)**
  - Verification of privileges or permissions to a given resource from an already authenticated user.
  - Examples: Open Authorization (OAuth2), JSON Web Token (JWT) for data exchange

### Why IAM is a Prime Target for Attackers
1. **Full Control of Authentication and Authorization**
2. **Externally Exposed on the Perimeter**
3. **Complex Technology Stacks and Protocols**

Breaching an IAM system on the perimeter can lead to the compromise of several other systems controlled by the organization.

### Federated Authentication – SAML
- **Overview**: SAML is a standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, particularly between an identity provider (IdP) and a service provider (SP).
- **Security Considerations**: XML token parsing (XXE, SSRF, XSLT), signature verification bypass (XSW, XML Canonicalization).

### Authorization – OAuth2
- **Overview**: OAuth2 is a protocol for authorization, allowing applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service.
- **Security Considerations**: Access token/authorization code leaks (XSS, CSRF, Open Redirect, Click Jacking).

### Past Attacks Against IAM Solutions
- **Oracle Access Manager (OAM)**
  - **Vulnerability**: Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CVE-2021-35587)
  - **Discovered by**: Jang and Peterjson
  - **Limitations**: None
  - **Impact**: OAM 11g impacted, but EOL; OAM 12g with latest patches not affected due to the removal of the vulnerable endpoint.

- **ForgeRock OpenAM**
  - **Vulnerability**: Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CVE-2021-35464)
  - **Discovered by**: Michael Stepankin
  - **Limitations**: None
  - **Patch**: Removed the vulnerable Jato library.

- **VMware Workspace ONE Access**
  - **Vulnerability**: Command Injection (CVE-2020-4006)
  - **Discovered by**: NSA
  - **Limitations**: Requires authentication as an Administrator, access to port 8443, and Spring CSRF protection.
  - **Exploited ITW**: 2020

### Target Selection & Vulnerability Discovery
- **Target: VMware Workspace ONE Access**
  - **Reasons**: Technical debt, complex technology stack, externally exposed, single point of failure, exploited ITW in 2020, no past pre-authenticated RCE, used by Fortune 500 companies.

- **Discovering CVE-2022-22954**
  - **Vulnerability Type**: Freemarker template injection
  - **Location**: `customError.ftl` template file
  - **Vulnerable Sink**: `errorObj?eval`
  - **Trigger**: `errorMessage` placed in `errorObj` and passed to `customError.ftl`
  - **Spring Configuration**: Implements `StrictHttpFirewall` by default since version 4.2.4 to block suspicious requests.
  - **Exploitation**: 
    - No need to escape the Freemarker sandbox; `new` built-in available.
    - Find a thrown Exception containing attacker-controlled data.
    - Target Spring Interceptors for unfiltered attacker-controlled data.

### Conclusions
- IAM systems are critical and often targeted due to their control over authentication and authorization.
- Understanding and mitigating vulnerabilities in IAM solutions is crucial for maintaining organizational security.
- Regular security assessments and timely patching are essential to protect against known and emerging threats.
