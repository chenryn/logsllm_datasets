on the same server [59] and then launch various attacks
(e.g., side-channel [26], [44], [51], [79] and covert-channel
attacks [25], [63]). Zhang et al. demonstrated that it is feasible
to launch real side-channel attacks on the cloud [73], [84],
[85]. Methods like last level cache [75], memory bus [70],
memory deduplication [71], core temperature [17], [53] are
effective for covert-channel construction. While multiple de-
fense mechanisms have also been proposed [20], [72], [81],
[83], [86], [87], it is still possible to achieve co-residence in
existing mainstream cloud services [67], [76]. With the shared
underlying computing resources, DoS attacks are thus possible
in clouds, including resource-freeing attacks [66], memory DoS
attacks [82], I/O exhausting attacks [37]. Moreover, multiple
attacks [31], [38]–[40], [49], [77] attempt to exhaust the shared
infrastructures (e.g., power facility) to launch DoS attacks. As
the insufﬁciencies in cgroups could also be exploited to launch
multiple attacks (e.g., covert channel / DoS) [29], our work
can help mitigate potential threats in clouds.
IX. CONCLUSION
We have presented TORPEDO, a fuzz testing framework
that aims to detect out-of-band workloads in containerization
platforms that can abuse the system resource allocation and gain
extra unfair advantages. TORPEDO leverages resource-guided
heuristics to ﬁnd system call inputs that maximize the unfairness
in system resource consumption across container instances. Our
evaluation conﬁrms vulnerabilities in popular containerization
platforms which were found with manual efforts. We also
identify several vulnerabilities that are unknown to the public.
