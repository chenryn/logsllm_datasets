### Introduction
With the variety of trunk-tracking scanners and software available, it can be challenging to understand talkgroup numbers and why they sometimes change during a conversation. This month, we will explore Motorola Type II talkgroups and their various display formats. Additionally, we will discuss a new radio system being built by Motorola for the state of Illinois.

### Type II Talkgroups
David, a user of a Uniden 780XLT scanner, reported the following talkgroup codes for the Palm Springs Police Department in California:
- **32784** - Main channel
- **32816** - Secondary
- **32912** - Surveillance

These codes differ from those listed in the Uniden/Bearcat booklet, which are in the format 200-13, 400-04, etc. The City of Palm Springs has a Motorola hybrid system, meaning it supports both Type I and Type II traffic. The police department uses Type II radios, while other city services use Type I. The city is licensed for five frequencies: 857.4875, 858.4875, 858.9625, 859.4875, and 860.7125 MHz.

Both Type I and Type II transmissions use sixteen binary digits (bits) to represent a talkgroup. These bits are transmitted with every repeater transmission and interpreted by the scanner.

### Type I vs. Type II Systems
- **Type I System:** Divides the 16 bits into blocks, fleets, subfleets, and users. Talkgroups are usually displayed as FFF-SS, where FFF is the Fleet ID and SS is the subfleet ID. Determining the exact division of these bits requires a fleet map, which was detailed in the August 2000 "Tracking the Trunks" column. Back issues of Monitoring Times are available for $4.50 from Grove Enterprises (800-438-8155), and previous columns can be found on the Signal Harbor website ([www.signalharbor.com](http://www.signalharbor.com)).

- **Type II System:** Divides the 16 bits into 12 bits for the talkgroup identifier and 4 status bits. The status bits identify special situations and are usually all zeroes.

#### Status Bits
| Right-most Status Bits | Decimal | Meaning |
|------------------------|---------|---------|
| 0000                   | 0       | Normal transmission |
| 0001                   | 1       | Fleet-wide (talkgroup for all radios) |
| 0010                   | 2       | Emergency |
| 0011                   | 3       | Crosspatch between talkgroups |
| 0100                   | 4       | Emergency crosspatch |
| 0101                   | 5       | Emergency multi-select |
| 0110                   | 6       | Unknown |
| 0111                   | 7       | Multi-select (initiated by the dispatcher) |

The three right-most status bits indicate if the message is an emergency and whether the talkgroup is interconnected. The left-most status bit indicates whether the transmission is encrypted using the Data Encryption Standard (DES). A zero bit means the message is not encrypted, and a one bit means it is encrypted. For example:
- **Normal message:** Status bits 0000 (0 in decimal)
- **Encrypted normal message:** Status bits 1000 (8 in decimal)
- **Emergency message (not encrypted):** Status bits 0010 (2 in decimal)
- **Encrypted emergency message:** Status bits 1010 (10 in decimal)

### Display Formats
Talkgroups can be displayed in several ways:
- **Decimal:** e.g., 32784 or 59216
- **Hexadecimal:** e.g., 801 or E75

#### Conversion Between Decimal and Hexadecimal
To convert between decimal and hexadecimal, you can use a scientific calculator, such as the one included with Microsoft Windows. Hereâ€™s how to do it:
1. Press the Start button, select Programs, then Accessories.
2. Click on the Calculator selection to start the program.
3. Switch to Scientific mode by clicking on "View" in the menu bar and choosing "Scientific".
4. Enter the decimal number (e.g., 32784) and select the "Hex" option to see the hexadecimal equivalent (e.g., 8010).
5. To view the binary representation, select the "Bin" option (e.g., 1000 0000 0001 0000).

In David's example, the main channel has a decimal talkgroup of 32784, which converts to 8010 in hexadecimal. Since the last four bits are zero for a normal talkgroup, many listings drop the last digit, resulting in 801.

### Illinois Starcom 21
Daryl provided information about a new radio system being built by Motorola for the state of Illinois. Governor Ryan announced a $25 million grant for a new radio system, Starcom 21, to be phased in over the next three years. The state will lease time on this network, which will be made available to other federal, state, and local public safety agencies.

#### Key Points
- **Funding:** Comes from the Venture TECH fund of the Illinois Technology Office.
- **Initiatives:** Includes expansion of the Illinois State Police Wireless Information Network, wireless access to photographic images and fingerprints, more rapid access to wants and warrants databases, and an automated voice dispatch system.
- **Coverage:** Phased in over three years, starting with the southern part of the state and moving northward.
- **Interoperability:** The goal is to have one common radio system to eliminate interoperability issues.

The Chicago District of the Illinois State Police currently uses two EDACS networks:
- **North Patrol Area:** 866.8875, 866.4625, 867.3875, 866.9625, 867.4625, 867.8875, 868.3875, 868.4625, 868.8875, and 868.9625 MHz.
- **South Patrol Area:** 866.4125, 866.4375, 866.9375, 867.4125, 867.9375, 867.9125, 868.4375, 868.4125, 868.9375, and 868.9125 MHz.

### NPSPAC Frequencies
Starcom 21 will likely operate on National Public Safety Planning Advisory Committee (NPSPAC) 800 MHz frequencies. Five channels in the 800 MHz band are set aside for mutual aid:
- **Calling Channel:** 866.0125 MHz
- **Tactical Channels:** 866.5125, 867.0125, 867.5125, and 868.0125 MHz

Each channel is 25 kHz wide and operates conventionally (not trunked) with a tone-coded squelch frequency of 156.7. Be sure to include these non-trunked frequencies in your scan banks.
