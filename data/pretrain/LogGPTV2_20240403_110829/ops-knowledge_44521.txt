Question: Imagine you are an architect designing the directory structure for a web application. You need to store library, include, and utility files in a way that minimizes the attack surface and prevents attackers from directly requesting these files. Which of the following approaches best aligns with the recommended strategy for attack surface reduction?
"A": "Store library files in the web document root and rely on the web server's default configuration to prevent direct access.",
"B": "Store library files outside of the web document root, or in a separate directory with access control to prevent direct file requests.",
"C": "Store utility files in a publicly accessible directory and use custom scripts to intercept and validate direct file requests.",
"D": "Store include files in the web document root with no additional access control, assuming that attackers will not guess the file paths."
Answer: B
