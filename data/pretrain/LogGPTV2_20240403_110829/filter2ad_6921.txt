ABSTRACT
A  common  characterstc  of  all  ad-hoc  networks  s  that  of 
emergent propertes. Intutvely, emergent propertes are features 
that cannot be provded by ndvdual network nodes themselves 
but  nstead  result  from  nteracton  and  collaboraton  among 
network nodes. In ths talk, we present the salent characterstcs 
of these propertes and dscuss ther securty mplcatons. Several 
examples of emergent  propertes n sensor and ad-hoc networks 
are dscussed ncludng key connectvty, trust establshment, and 
node  replca  detecton.  We  conclude  wth  a  common  theme  of 
current research n securty of emergent propertes, namely that of 
a  new  threat  model  whereby  the  adversary  may  adaptvely 
compromse nodes of a network. We contrast ths theme wth that 
of past research  that  lmts  an  adversary  to  “man-n-the-mddle” 
attacks and reles exclusvely on end-to-end securty solutons.
