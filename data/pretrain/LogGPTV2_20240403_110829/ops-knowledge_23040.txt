User: I tried doing a "pwd" or cwd, after the cd, it does not seem to work when we use os.system("cd"). Is there something going on with the way the child processes are created. This is all under Linux.
Assistant: os.system (which is just a thin wrapper around the POSIX system call) runs the command in a shell launched as a child of the current process. Running a cd in that shell only changes the current directory of that process, not the parent.
