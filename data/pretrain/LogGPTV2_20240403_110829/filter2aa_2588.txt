**Phase 0: Preparations**
Ensure the radio is in good working order on its original frequencies before attempting the conversion for Amateur Radio use.

**Phase 1: Operating Frequency Reprogramming**

**Option 1: Modify Original GE MVS v3.0 Software**
1. Copy `MVS.EXE` to `MVS220.EXE`.
2. Use a hex editor (e.g., XVI32) to edit `MVS220.EXE` with the following changes:
   - **Hex Address**: &H1A328
     - **Original Data**: C0 62
     - **New Data**: 00 60
   - **Hex Address**: &H1A33F
     - **Original Data**: C0 65
     - **New Data**: 20 6C
   - **Hex Address**: &H1B8E9
     - **Original Data**: C0 62
     - **New Data**: 00 60
   - **Hex Address**: &H1B8F1
     - **Original Data**: C0 65
     - **New Data**: 20 6C
3. This modification allows programming in the 128 to 225 MHz range. Transmit frequencies will show true, but receive frequencies must be programmed minus 90 MHz (e.g., 223.500 MHz RX is programmed as 133.500 MHz).

**Option 2: Use Alternate Firmware**
1. Refer to the website: [http://www.dave-page.com/projects.html](http://www.dave-page.com/projects.html)
2. This firmware was designed for the 900 MHz GE TMX-9315 and includes provisions for the GE MVS in the 220 MHz band.
3. It requires a large EPROM with a built-in latch buffer (87C257). Later G11 logic boards have this IC installed, while earlier G5 boards need the smaller EPROM replaced and additional modifications.
4. The firmware is intended for use with the GE TMX test handset or a modified GE CF-1000 car phone as the display. It will not drive the stock MVS front panel.
5. Additional modifications may be required if using a TMX audio board in the MVS.

**Testing:**
- Program the radio to:
  - Channel 1: 223.500 MHz Simplex
  - Channel 2: 224.800 MHz Simplex

**Phase 2: VCO Modification**
1. Cut the trace on the RF board feeding the DPTT signal to R208 and R209 after the trace that goes to R248.
2. Scrape the solder mask and expose the copper trace of the original DPTT signal.
3. Install a logic inverter consisting of an NPN transistor with a 2.2-10K resistor on the base lead. Solder the emitter to ground, the base resistor to the bare trace, and the collector to the junction of R208 and R209.
4. Set the radio to receive on 224.80 MHz and adjust R218 for 6.5 VDC as measured on test point J201.

**Phase 3: Low Pass Filter Modification**
1. Remove the RF board from the radio.
2. Replace the 18pF capacitor at position C2 with a 10pF capacitor.
3. Replace the 11pF capacitor at C3 with a 4.7pF capacitor.
4. This raises the 3dB corner frequency to approximately 250 MHz, with a loss of -56dB at the 2nd harmonic frequency of 447 MHz.

**Phase 4: Receiver Modification**
1. Remove the RF board from the chassis.
2. Replace L405 with a 110uH coil (9 turns of #22 wire closely spaced on a 1/8” drill bit).
3. Replace L402 with a 44uH coil (4.5 turns of #22 wire closely spaced on a 1/8” drill bit).
4. Remove Z401 (a 3-pole tuned helical filter set to cover 136-174 MHz).
5. Construct a replacement image rejection filter with the following components:
   - 2 x 4.7pF capacitors
   - 1 x 90-degree open coax stub cut to 133.5 MHz + 0.5” (15.25” for RG-174u)
6. Install the filter in the original position of Z401. Solder the capacitors to the I/O holes of Z401 and the outer conductor of the coax stub to ground.
7. Reinstall the RF board in the chassis and tune the receiver. Adjust the spacing of L402, L405, and turn C408. My receiver achieved -118dB for 12dB SINAD.
8. Tune the image filter by setting a signal generator to the current receive frequency minus 90 MHz. Trim the stub for the lowest received signal, increasing the generator output as necessary. The test radio achieved 86dB of image rejection.

**Phase 5: 200mW VHF TX Exciter Modification**
1. Remove the TX Exciter from the RF board using a wide braid solder wick and suitable iron.
2. Replace the 39pF capacitor at C6 with a 22pF capacitor. Replace the capacitor at C1 with the 39pF capacitor removed from C6.
3. Reinstall the TX Exciter into the RF board, keeping the boards at a 90-degree angle while soldering.

**Phase 6: 10W VHF Power Amplifier Replacement**
1. The following power modules are drop-in replacements for the M57719 currently in the radio:
   - **M57774**: 300mW input, 30W output (Class C)
   - **M68729**: 300mW input, 30W output (Class C)
   - **SAV15**: 200mW input, 30W output (Class C)
2. For the RA30H2127M module:
   - **Power Input**: 50mW
   - **Power Output**: 30W (MOSFET)
   - **Modifications**:
     - Pin 2 is Vgate instead of 1st Amplifier Vcc. Add a 470 ohm resistor between the base of Q101 and ground.
     - Machine the metal case flat for optimal contact with the heat sink.
     - Clean the holes with solder wick, insert the new module, and do not solder until the RF board is reinserted into the radio and the rear case screws are in place.
3. Bypass the 45W VHF Power Amplifier stage by placing a coax jumper between J102 and J103 on the RF board. The test radio produced 25 watts after the low pass filter using the SAV15.

**Phase 7: 45W VHF Power Amplifier Modification**
1. Remove C151.
2. Replace L151 with a wire jumper close to the PCB.
3. Replace C152 with a 56pF ceramic 1206 capacitor.
4. Remove C156 and C157.
5. Install a pair of 43pF ceramic 1206 capacitors or one each 39 and 47pF on Q151 Collector and Emitter leads.
6. Remove C158 (33pF) and install it at C157.
7. Modify L156 to 1/2 turn and reinstall.
8. Install a 20pF ceramic 1206 capacitor at C158.
9. The test radio produced 45 watts after the low pass filter, with the 3rd harmonic at approximately -54dBc.

**Optional Modification: Internal Speaker Audio Level**
1. Replace R811 on the front panel board with a 0 ohm resistor or wire lead, leaving clearance space due to the via underneath the resistor landing area.
