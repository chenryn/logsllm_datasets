Phase 0: Preparations
Make sure the radio to be converted is in good working order on its original frequencies 
before attempting conversion to Amateur Radio use. 
Phase 1: Operating Frequency Reprogramming
Option 1: Hack Original GE MVS v3.0 software to allow out of range programming.
Copy MVS.EXE to MVS220.EXE
Using a suitable hex editor such as XVI32, Edit MVS220.EXE and make the following 
changes:
Hex Address
Original Data
New Data
&H1A328
C0 62
00 60
&H1A33F
C0 65
20 6C
&H1B8E9
C0 62
00 60
&H1B8F1
C0 65
20 6C
This changes the programming range of the software to allow 128 to 225 MHz. Transmit 
frequencies will show true, Receive frequencies will now have to be programmed minus 
90 MHz. I.E. 223.500 MHz RX is programmed as 133.500 MHz.
Option 2: Use alternate firmware on the logic board. 
Please refer to the following website:
http://www.dave-page.com/projects.html
This firmware was originally designed to run the 900 MHz GE TMX-9315 in amateur 
bands, provisions were made to port the code to the GE MVS and one of the bands was 
220. 
It is also meant to be used with the GE TMX test handset, or a modified GE CF-1000 
car phone as the display. It will not drive the stock MVS front panel. There is a handset 
emulator program that can get the radio programmed and is useful for making link 
radios where VFO programming is not needed.
The firmware requires a large EPROM with a built in latch buffer. 87C257. Later G11 
logic boards have this IC installed and no further modifications are necessary. Early 
logic boards such as the G5 have the smaller EPROM. This must be replaced for the 
87C257 and some modifications are needed to the G5 board as outlined in the 
documentation. 
Also note that the author of the firmware recommends using a TMX audio board in the 
MVS and there may be additional modifications required that are not documented.
For testing program the radio to the following:
Channel 1 – 223.500 MHz Simplex
Channel 2 – 224.800 MHz Simplex
Phase 2: VCO
Cut the trace on the RF board, feeding the DPTT signal to R208 and R209 after the 
trace that goes to R248. Scrape solder mask and expose the copper trace that is the 
original DPTT signal.
Install a logic inverter consisting of a NPN transistor with 2.2-10K resistor on the base 
lead. Solder emitter to ground, base resistor to the bare trace and collector to R208 and 
R209 junction.
Installed VCO Inverter Transistor
This effectively makes the VCO band select backwards so the VCO runs in the 222 
MHz range on TX and around 178 MHz on RX.
Set the radio to receive on 224.80 MHz. Adjust R218 for 6.5 VDC as measured on test 
point J201.
Phase 3: Low Pass Filter
With the RF board out of the radio the Low Pass Filter can be modified easily.
Remove the 18pF capacitor at position C2 and replace with 10pF. Remove the 11pF 
capacitor at C3 and replace with 4.7pF. 
This raises the 3dB corner frequency to approximately 250 MHz. The loss at the 2nd 
harmonic frequency of 447 MHz was measured to be -56dB

Phase 4: Receiver
Remove RF board from chassis again.
Replace L405 with a 110uH coil, 9 Turns of #22 wire closely spaced on a 1/8” drill bit. 
The magnet wire is available from Radio Hut in the 315 ft. Magnet Wire Kit #278-1345, 
It is the spool that is gold in color. Remove the enamel from the ends of the coil and tin 
it. I like to do both operations at once with a pool of solder on the end of a broad tipped 
iron. Leave the coil on the drill bit while tinning to act as a heat sink.
Replace L402 with a 44uH coil. 4 ½ turns of #22 closely spaced on a 1/8” drill bit. 
Follow same procedure as L405.
Remove Z401. This is a 3 pole tuned helical filter set to cover 136-174 MHz.  The filter 
was determined to be too small to work on.
Frequency Response of 136-174 MHz 3 Pole Helical Image Filter
Construct a replacement image rejection filter for with the following components:
2 x 4.7pF capacitors
1 x 90 degree open coax stub cut to 133.5 MHz + 0.5” (15.25” for RG-174u)
Replacement Image Filter Schematic
Install filter in original position of Z401. Solder the capacitors to the I/O holes of Z401 
and solder the outer conductor of the coax stub to ground.
Replacement Image Filter Measured Performance
Reinstall RF board in chassis. Tune receiver. Adjust the spacing of L402, L405 and turn 
C408. My receiver came to -118dB for 12dB SINAD.
Modified RF board, showing replaced L402, L405 and Replacement Image Filter.
Tune image filter.  Set a signal generator for the current receive frequency minus 90 
MHz. Trim stub for lowest received signal, increase generator output as necessary. Test 
radio was able to make 86dB of image rejection.
Phase 5: 200mW VHF TX Exciter
Remove the TX Exciter from the RF board using a wide braid solder wick and suitable 
iron.
Remove the 39pF capacitor at C6 and replace with 22pF. Replace the capacitor at C1 
with the 39pF capacitor removed from C6. This raises the 3dB corner frequency of the 
exciter to approximately 275 MHz.
Modified TX Exciter Board
Reinstall TX Exciter into RF board. Keep boards at 90 degree angle to each other while 
soldering.

Phase 6: 10W VHF Power Amplifier Replacement
The following Power Modules are in the H2 style case and are drop in replacements for 
the M57719 which is currently in the radio.

While it is pin compatible with the radio, the RA30H2127M requires some additional 
modifications.

30W (MOSFET)
Pin 2 of the RA30H2127M is Vgate instead of 1st Amplifier Vcc. This pin requires 5 volts 
to reach full gain of the module. Voltage above 6.5 VDC may cause damage. It is 
recommended to add a 470 ohm resistor between the base of Q101 and ground, but 
this has not been tested.
It is also recommended that the metal case of the module be machined flat for optimum 
contact with the heat sink to enhance the impedance to ground and thermal transfer. It 
is possible to do this with a belt sander and a fine grit belt such as 220 and higher. Care 
must be taken not to absorb the metal particles into your skin or breathe them, 
otherwise metal poisoning may result.
Remove the module currently in the radio and clean the holes with solder wick. Insert 
the new module into the board but do not solder it until the RF board is inserted back 
into the radio and the rear case screws are in place. There should be enough excess 
thermal paste on the heat sink and additional compound should not be necessary.
These modules may provide the user with adequate power and the 45W VHF Power 
Amplifier stage can be bypassed by placing a coax jumper between J102 and J103 on 
the RF board. The test radio was able to produce 25 watts after the low pass filter using 
the SAV15. If used in conjunction with the 45W PA, power output of the module should 
not exceed 10W.
Phase 7: 45W VHF Power Amplifier
Remove C151
Replace L151 with wire jumper close to PCB
Replace C152 with 56pF ceramic 1206
Remove C156 & C157
Install a pair of 43pF ceramic 1206 capacitors or 1 each 39 and 47pF on Q151 Collector 
and emitter leads
Remove C158, 33pF and install at C157
Remove L156 and modify to 1/2 turn and reinstall
Install 20pF ceramic 1206 at C158
Modified 45W PA Spectral Purity
The test radio was able to produce 45 watts after the low pass filter. 3rd harmonic was 
approximately -54dBc
Optional Modification: Internal Speaker Audio Level
By design the radio will not silence the speaker audio. This can be annoying if the radio 
is placed into link service, APRS and other applications where speaker audio is only 
occasionally needed.
To remedy this, replace R811 on the Front panel board with a 0 ohm resistor or wire 
lead. If wire lead is used, leave clearance space as there is a via right under the resistor 
landing area.
