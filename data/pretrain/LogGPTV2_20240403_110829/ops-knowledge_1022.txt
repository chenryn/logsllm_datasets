User: How to ensure the security and reliability of the database? Please list at least three measures.
Assistant: 1. Data backup: Regularly back up the database to ensure data security. In case of accidental data deletion, virus attack, database system downtime and other unexpected situations, the data can be quickly restored to ensure the normal operation of the business. 2. Authority management: establish a strict user authority management system, and implement security control over sensitive data, system commands, and database files in the database to ensure that unauthorized personnel cannot access and modify the database. 3. Security monitoring: Use security monitoring software to monitor the running status of the database in real time, regularly scan and repair database security vulnerabilities, and promptly give early warning and take measures to ensure the security and reliability of the database.
