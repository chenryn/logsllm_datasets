## 1. Introduction

### NSA Playset Series
- **What is the NSA Playset?**
  - The NSA Playset aims to make cutting-edge security tools more accessible, easier to understand, and harder to forget.
  
- **NSA Playset Talks at DEF CON 22:**
  - **RF Retroreflector** - Penn & Teller, Friday, 12:00
  - **DIY Hardware Implant** - Track 1, Sunday, 11:00
  - **GSM Sniffing** - Track 1, Sunday, 12:00
  - **PCIe** - Track 2, Sunday, 14:00

### Inspired by the NSA
- The NSA has a hardware hacking catalog, similar to SkyMall but for spies.
- Example: An I2C controller board that can be attached to a computer and includes a modular GSM module for exfiltration.

### Requirements for the Implant
- Must attach over I2C to the target.
- Must include GSM reachback to the implant.
- Additional requirements:
  - Easy to use.
  - Open Source Hardware.
  - Flexible: Allow for multiple communication and software protocols.
  - Fun: Single-chip solutions are less engaging.

## 2. Deconstruction

### Background: What is I2C?
- **Serial Bus**: Two-wire interface (SDA for data, SCL for clock) plus power and ground.
- **Multi-master and Multi-slave**: Supports multiple masters and slaves.
- **Addressable**: Devices have unique addresses.
- **Speeds**: Standard speed is 100kHz (100kbps), with a theoretical max of 3.2Mbps.
- **Power**: Typically 5V or 3.3V.

### I2C in Visual Form
- [Insert visual representation of I2C]

### I2C Attack Surfaces
- **RAM EEPROMs**
- **PCI and PCIe**
- **Battery Controllers**
- **Video Interfaces** (e.g., EDID on monitor adapters)

### Video I2C
- **EDID (Extended Display Identification Data)**: Used for automatic detection of monitor resolution.
- **DDC (Data Display Channel)**: A 5V I2C interface.

### EDID Extension Blocks
- **Tag Number**: Description
  - `00h`: Timing Extension
  - `02h`: CEA-EXT: CEA 861 Series Extension
  - `10h`: VTB-EXT: Video Timing Block Extension
  - `20h`: EDID 2.0 Extension
  - `40h`: DI-EXT: Display Information Extension
  - `50h`: LS-EXT: Localized String Extension
  - `60h`: DPVL-EXT: Digital Packet Video Link Extension
  - `A7h, AFh, BFh`: DTCDB-EXT: Display Transfer Characteristics
  - `F0h`: EXTENSION Block Map
  - `FFh`: Extensions defined by the OEM

### Exploiting EDID/EDID Extension Parsing
- **Hacking Displays Made Interesting** (Blackhat EU 2012)
  - Andy Davis, NGS Secure
  - [GitHub: EDID Fuzzer](https://github.com/nccgroup/EDIDFuzzer)
  - Simple adaptation for BeagleBone implemented in Python (BBIO)
  - [GitHub: Bone-EDIDFuzzer](https://github.com/theopolis/bone-edidfuzzer)
  - Discover proprietary EDID extensions through fuzzing.

### I2C Everywhere
- **Video Cards**: Multiple I2C buses and devices, such as:
  - EEPROM for encrypted HDCP keys
  - Onboard voltage regulator
  - Thermal sensor
  - TV decoder chip (older cards)

### Exploring VGA I2C
- **VGA Pinout**:
  - **Pin 1**: Red Video
  - **Pin 2**: Green Video
  - **Pin 3**: Blue Video
  - **Pin 5**: Ground
  - **Pin 9**: Optional +5V output from graphics card
  - **Pin 12**: SDA (I2C data)
  - **Pin 15**: SCL (I2C data clock)
