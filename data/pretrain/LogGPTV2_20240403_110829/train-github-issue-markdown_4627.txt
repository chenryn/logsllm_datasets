This is related to #12766  
Possibly a duplicate.
#### A small, complete example of the issue
    DD = pd.DataFrame({'A':[1,2,3,4,5]})
    DD.index.name = 'Test'
    print DD.index.name
    DD.index = DD.index.map(unicode)
    print DD.index.name
#### Expected Output
The mapping operation deletes the index name.
However mapping a function on the index means modifying an existing index, so
one would expect the name of the index to stay the same as opposed to when
choosing a completely new index.
#### Output of `pd.show_versions()`
    python: 2.7.12.final.0
    pandas: 0.19.0
#### EDIT:
Doing a `set_index(column)` does NOT set the column name as the index name, I
think it would be common sense that the name of the column which becomes the
new index be automatically set as the index name.
