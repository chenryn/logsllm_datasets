This is a request for the C# Extension. Essentially, the extension needs
platform-specific native binaries in order to function (both for debugging
support and OmniSharp for language server support). It does this by acquiring
the binaries during the extension's first activation, rather than during
installation. So, the user experience for installation is a bit awkward:
  1. Install C# Extension
  2. VS Code prompts to restart after successful installation
  3. User restarts VS Code and opens a C# project
  4. User waits after the "installed" extension finishes installing itself by acquiring native dependencies
To make matters worse, in order to acquire the native dependencies, the
extension essentially has to copy code from VS Code in order to handle HTTP
proxies correctly (see dotnet/vscode-csharp@`b8f01e4`).
