I have a simple file at /etc/foo.txt. The file contains the following:
    #bar
I have the following ansible playbook task to uncomment the line above:
    - name: test lineinfile
      lineinfile: backup=yes state=present dest=/etc/foo.txt
                  regexp='^#bar'
                  line='bar'
When I first run ansible-playbook, the line gets uncommented and the
/etc/foo.txt now contains the following:
    bar
However, if I run ansible-playbook again, I get the following:
    bar
    bar
If I run it yet again, then the /etc/foo.txt file will look like this:
    bar
    bar
    bar
I believe these duplications of lines are a bug.
Happens on ansible-playbook 1.3.3 and 1.2.2.
