When we include json content as part of template html, we are getting template
parsing errors like below. we use json content heavily in our current Angular
v1 application to inject locale content to be used in directive html text
labels.
_Template parse errors:  
Unexpected character "EOF" (Do you have an unescaped "{" in your template? Use
"{{ '{' }}") to escape it.) ("  
}_
Ex: page template html (use custom directive transcluded with json content)  
`
{ "lblFName": "xyz" }
`
custom directive template html (we internally get the transcluded json content
to vm.content variable and use it in the directive template)  
`{{::vm.content.lblFName}}`
we are trying to research on upgrading our application to Angular2 with RC5
version but getting template parsing errors when trying to include json
content like above. Do we have any other options to support this feature in
Angular2 or allow us to override or add support to Angular2 template parser to
ignore json content like above ...
Error message specifies, that we need to escape { char with '{', having to
escape complex json content structure would be time consuming and we are
looking for any other options are available in Angular2 for this...
