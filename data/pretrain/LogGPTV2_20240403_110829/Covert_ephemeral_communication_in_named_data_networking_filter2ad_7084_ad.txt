apart (ten hops over IP).
Snd and Rcv exchange 1,000-bit messages. Each message
is a fresh random bit string. This is representative of the
distribution of encrypted messages.
Naturally, our protocols generate communication over-
head. We used 41-byte interests and 377-byte content pack-
ets (on average). With single-bit transmission (either using
PIT and cache), each message bit set to 1 requires Snd to ex-
change 418 bytes. Regardless of message content, Rcv needs
to send/receive 418 bytes per message bit. With the TDP
protocol, each message bit costs 418 bytes to Snd and 836
bytes to Rcv. When transmitting multiple bits with a sin-
gle interest, m message bits cost Snd 418 bytes, and 2m· 418
bytes to Rcv. Finally, with CPC both Snd and Rcv exchange
418 bytes for each m-bit word.
In our experiments, Snd can send messages at a rate dif-
ferent from the rate at which Rcv receives them. This is
possible due to the state in routers (i.e., cache or PIT, de-
pending on the technique used).
7.1 Evaluation of Delay-Based
Cache Techniques
In order to assess feasibility of cache-based techniques, we
compared RTT associated with cache hits and cache misses
in both LAN and testbed scenarios.
Figure 3 summarizes our ﬁndings and represents average
values over 100,000 content packets. While there is virtu-
ally no overlap between RTT of cache hits and misses in
a controlled (LAN) environment, RTT ﬂuctuations on the
testbed do not always allow us to distinguish a cache hit
from a cache miss. However, the overlap is still relatively
small and, as conﬁrmed by further experiments, it is possi-
ble to implement a reliable CEC on the testbed.

We then looked into how interest sending rate aﬀects RTT.
We selected values for t varying from tmin = 0.3 µs to t = 5
ms (see Section 4.4). We performed several experiments,
each using 100,000 content packets. Before each experiment,
we restarted Rt in order to remove all cache entries. Results
are reported in Figure 4.

(f) Testbed, t = 0.5 ms
Figure 4: RTT for content packets, varying request rate.
In LAN (ﬁgures 4a, 4c, and 4e), RTTs of cache hits and
cache misses are clearly separated, regardless of t. On the
testbed (ﬁgures 4b, 4d, and 4f), for small values of t, cache
hits and misses signiﬁcantly overlap for messages longer than
200 bits. This suggests that short busts, separated by short
pauses, provide lower error rates.
For cache-based CEC, we evaluated read and write errors
separately, while varying t and tthresh . To evaluate write
errors, Snd published of 100,000 covert bits for each value

this experiment, the delay between interests from Snd and
Rcv is 0.8 ms in LAN, and 8 ms on the testbed. Results are
shown in Figure 8. With appropriate choice of the threshold
parameter, errors in LAN are negligible, and below 7.5% in
the testbed.

7.3 TDP Evaluation
We measured the error rate varying write and read speeds
separately for Snd and Rcv. Figures 9a and 9b summarize
our ﬁndings. On the receiver side, this technique performs
better than the cache-hit-based one. For example, for t =
1.5 ms in the testbed, the error for TPD is less than 2% (see
Figure 9b),while for t = 3 (i.e., the same eﬀective bit rate
relative to the CEM) in the cache-hit-based technique the
error for is more than 4% (Figure 5).

7.4 Evaluation of Common-Preﬁx-Based
Technique
We set m = 1 (i.e., each content packet encodes one bit),
in order to encode 1,000-bit CEM using 1,000 content pack-
ets. We run separate experiments to evaluate Snd and Rcv

measurement error. We estimate to be negligible in LAN,
and below 1.5% on the testbed. With cache-based CEC,
write errors can be completely eliminated if Snd re-issues
interests for content that it did not receive; although, writing
time increases.
To measure read errors, Snd published 100,000 covert bits,
separated in groups of 1,000-bit CEMs, for each value of t
and tthresh . Results of this experiment are shown in Figure 6.
Due to the clear separation between RTTs associated with
cache hits and misses in LAN, read errors were very low for
a wide range of parameters (e.g., for tthresh between 1 and
1.5 ms). On the testbed, error was typically between 3%
and 5% for tthresh between 191 and 193 ms.
7.2 Evaluation of Delay-Based
PIT Techniques
We requested the same content packet from both Snd and
Rcv at very close intervals (i.e., 0.5 and 1 ms in LAN and
2 ms on testbed), in order to trigger interest collapsing on
Rt, and, therefore, a PIT hit. Snd and Rcv were synchro-
nized using a local NTP server; we estimated the time dif-
ference between the two hosts to be below 0.2 ms. Our
experiments show that is possible to distinguish PIT hits
from misses using appropriate intervals between interests
from Snd and Rcv. Results of this experiment are shown
in Figure 7. However, the separation is less clear than with
cache, as shown in the same ﬁgure. Moreover, this channel
requires much tighter synchronization between Snd and Rcv
(i.e., sub-millisecond in LAN, and within 2 ms on testbed).
For these reasons, PIT-based CEC are signiﬁcantly more
diﬃcult to implement.
Since Snd and Rcv must operate synchronously and with
the same t, we measured read and write errors jointly. For

As mentioned in Section 6, both parties can avoid
packet-loss-induced errors using interest retransmission. For
a fair comparison with previous protocols, we test how the
common-preﬁx-based technique performs without retrans-
missions.
Results on write errors, both in our LAN and on the
testbed, are identical to those in Figure 9a. Snd performs
the same actions to send a CEM. Read errors on the testbed
are reported in Figure 10. We omit the plot corresponding
to read errors in LAN, since for all tested values of t error
rate was below 0.03%. Errors for both Snd and Rcv are due
to packet loss.

ing t.
7.5 Bit Rate and Error Comparison
To simplify comparison of techniques introduced in this
paper, we combine eﬀective bit rate and corresponding error
for all our protocols in Figure 11. Note that, for TDP, Snd’s
eﬀective bit rate can be multiplied by an arbitrary m, while
Rcv’s bit rate should be divided by 2m. Analogously, the bit
rate for both Snd and Rcv in the common-preﬁx protocol
should be multiplied by m as discussed in Section 5.
8. SECURITY ANALYSIS
We now analyze security of CEC techniques. We start by
showing that proposed protocols are retroactively private
and secure against message recovery attack. We then con-
clude with an informal discussion on the detectability and
robustness of our approaches.
8.1 Retroactive Privacy
Adv has non-negligible advantage over 1/2 in the retroac-
tive privacy game (see Section 3) only if it can infer infor-
mation about a from interaction with Snd, Rcv and Rt after
the message Ma has expired. That is, Adv can only inter-
act with protocol participants after content packets used to
encode Ma have been removed from Rt’s PIT and from all
caches.
Since Snd and Rcv delete Ma as soon as they (respec-
tively) send and receive it, Adv cannot acquire information
about Ma by compromising the two parties. Similarly, NDN
routers do not keep track of content packets once they disap-
pear from both PIT and cache. Therefore, after Ma expires,
Rt carries no information about the message. As a result,
there is simply no information about Ma within the network
after the message expires.
8.2 Security Against Message-Recovery
Attacks
In order to reconstruct a CEM, Adv can probe all NDN
routers, and try to identify content packets used for covert
communication. However, this approach has two problems:
(1) there is no content packet in routers caches for a bit set to
0; therefore, Adv cannot learn information about these bits
by simply observing routers caches. (2) even for a relatively
small NDN deployment, the number of routers and the size
of their caches makes this attack infeasible.
Another adversarial strategy consists in inﬁltration of the
routing infrastructure: Adv could mount a Sybil attack [30],
deploying a large number of malicious NDN routers. We be-
lieve that this approach is not feasible, since: (1) Adv cannot
deploy an arbitrary number of NDN routers. Even if NDN
is implemented as an overlay, routers are identiﬁed by their
unique IP address. This would force Adv to obtain a very
large number of public IP address. (2) Even if the adver-
sary succeeds deploying a large number of routers, it must
log all content packets forwarded by all controlled routers.
This may not be feasible. (3) Similarly, even if Adv can com-
promise arbitrary routers, maintaining logs for all forwarded
content packets would not be viable.
8.3 Detectability
In order to exchange a message through our protocols, Snd
and Rcv do not need to communicate directly, nor they need
to be connected through the same NDN router. Moreover,
they only interact with the network as prescribed by NDN
speciﬁcations.
A single-bit message b = 0 sent using single-bit transmis-
sion via cache or PIT cannot be detected, since Snd per-
forms no action. When b = 1, Snd retrieves a non-popular
content packet. We believe that, in practice, by ﬂagging all
single interests for non-popular content packets as “suspi-
cious”, Adv would incur in an overwhelmingly large number
of false alarms. Similarly, a single interest issued by Rcv to
retrieve b would be easily hidden by the existing traﬃc.
When Snd and Rcv exchange messages longer than a sin-
gle bit, however, their actions become more detectable. In
particular, the longer the message, the more likely it is for
Adv to correctly identify a CEM between two or more par-
ties. While a single interest for non-popular content packets
may not raise any suspect, a long streak of interests for non-
popular content packets may be easy to notice. For this
reason, Snd and Rcv should limit the size of the exchanged
messages to reduce detectability.
Finally, with namespace-based covert communication de-
tectability mostly depends on m and on the size of the
covert.
In particular, a higher value for m implies lower
detectability:
less content packets have to be requested to
write and read a covert message.
8.4 Robustness
When Rt introduces arbitrary delays to conceal cache hits,
our techniques based on measuring time diﬀerence between
these two events do not work. However, techniques based
on PIT and on common preﬁxes are not aﬀected by cache
hit delays, since they either do not rely on cache or do not
consider RTT.
Similarly, when the network introduces unpredictable de-
lays on packets (e.g., when traﬃc intensity has sudden wide
ﬂuctuations), common-preﬁx-based technique may be more
appropriate since it does not rely on timing measurements.
