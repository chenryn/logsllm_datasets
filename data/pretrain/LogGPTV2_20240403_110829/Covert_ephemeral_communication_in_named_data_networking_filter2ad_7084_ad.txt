### Communication Overhead and Message Exchange

In our protocol, the sender (Snd) and receiver (Rcv) exchange 1,000-bit messages, each consisting of a fresh random bit string. This setup is representative of the distribution of encrypted messages.

Our protocols generate communication overhead. We used 41-byte interests and 377-byte content packets on average. For single-bit transmission (using either PIT or cache), each message bit set to 1 requires Snd to exchange 418 bytes. Regardless of the message content, Rcv needs to send/receive 418 bytes per message bit. With the TDP protocol, each message bit costs Snd 418 bytes and Rcv 836 bytes. When transmitting multiple bits with a single interest, m message bits cost Snd 418 bytes, and 2m * 418 bytes to Rcv. Finally, with CPC, both Snd and Rcv exchange 418 bytes for each m-bit word.

In our experiments, Snd can send messages at a different rate from the rate at which Rcv receives them. This is possible due to the state in routers (i.e., cache or PIT, depending on the technique used).

### Evaluation of Delay-Based Cache Techniques

To assess the feasibility of cache-based techniques, we compared the Round-Trip Time (RTT) associated with cache hits and cache misses in both LAN and testbed scenarios.

**Figure 3: PDF for cache hit and cache miss**

- **(a) LAN**
- **(b) Testbed**

While there is virtually no overlap between RTT of cache hits and misses in a controlled (LAN) environment, RTT fluctuations on the testbed do not always allow us to distinguish a cache hit from a cache miss. However, the overlap is still relatively small, and further experiments confirm that it is possible to implement a reliable CEC on the testbed.

We then investigated how the interest sending rate affects RTT. We selected values for t ranging from tmin = 0.3 µs to t = 5 ms (see Section 4.4). Each experiment used 100,000 content packets, and we restarted Rt before each experiment to remove all cache entries.

**Figure 4: RTT for content packets, varying request rate**

- **(a) LAN, t = tmin**
- **(b) Testbed, t = tmin**
- **(c) LAN, t = 0.2 ms**
- **(d) Testbed, t = 0.2 ms**
- **(e) LAN, t = 0.5 ms**
- **(f) Testbed, t = 0.5 ms**

In the LAN (Figures 4a, 4c, and 4e), RTTs of cache hits and misses are clearly separated, regardless of t. On the testbed (Figures 4b, 4d, and 4f), for small values of t, cache hits and misses significantly overlap for messages longer than 200 bits. This suggests that short bursts, separated by short pauses, provide lower error rates.

### Cache-Based CEC Evaluation

For cache-based CEC, we evaluated read and write errors separately while varying t and tthresh. To evaluate write errors, Snd published 100,000 covert bits for each value of t. Covert bits were subsequently requested at a low rate (t = 100 ms) by Rcv. We estimated the number of content packets not retrieved from cache.

**Figure 5: Cache-hit-based protocol: write error, varying t**

- **(a) LAN**
- **(b) Testbed**

In this experiment, Rcv introduces a small measurement error. The error is negligible in LAN and below 1.5% on the testbed. With cache-based CEC, write errors can be completely eliminated if Snd re-issues interests for content it did not receive, although writing time increases.

To measure read errors, Snd published 100,000 covert bits, separated into groups of 1,000-bit CEMs, for each value of t and tthresh. Results are shown in Figure 6.

**Figure 6: Cache-hit-based protocol: read error varying tthresh and t**

- **(a) LAN**
- **(b) Testbed**

Due to the clear separation between RTTs associated with cache hits and misses in LAN, read errors were very low for a wide range of parameters (e.g., for tthresh between 1 and 1.5 ms). On the testbed, the error was typically between 3% and 5% for tthresh between 191 and 193 ms.

### Evaluation of Delay-Based PIT Techniques

We requested the same content packet from both Snd and Rcv at very close intervals (i.e., 0.5 and 1 ms in LAN and 2 ms on the testbed) to trigger interest collapsing on Rt and, therefore, a PIT hit. Snd and Rcv were synchronized using a local NTP server, with an estimated time difference below 0.2 ms. Our experiments show that it is possible to distinguish PIT hits from misses using appropriate intervals between interests from Snd and Rcv.

**Figure 7: RTT for content packets causing PIT collisions**

- **(a) LAN**
- **(b) Testbed**

However, the separation is less clear than with cache, as shown in the same figure. Moreover, this channel requires much tighter synchronization between Snd and Rcv (i.e., sub-millisecond in LAN, and within 2 ms on the testbed). For these reasons, PIT-based CEC is significantly more difficult to implement.

Since Snd and Rcv must operate synchronously and with the same t, we measured read and write errors jointly. Results are shown in Figure 8. With appropriate choice of the threshold parameter, errors in LAN are negligible, and below 7.5% on the testbed.

### TDP Evaluation

We measured the error rate while varying write and read speeds separately for Snd and Rcv. Figures 9a and 9b summarize our findings. On the receiver side, this technique performs better than the cache-hit-based one. For example, for t = 1.5 ms in the testbed, the error for TPD is less than 2% (see Figure 9b), while for t = 3 (i.e., the same effective bit rate relative to the CEM) in the cache-hit-based technique, the error is more than 4% (Figure 5).

- **(b) Read error variation**

### Evaluation of Common-Prefix-Based Technique

We set m = 1 (i.e., each content packet encodes one bit) to encode a 1,000-bit CEM using 1,000 content packets. We ran separate experiments to evaluate Snd and Rcv.

**Figure 10: Common-prefix-based protocol: read error varying t**

- **(a) LAN**
- **(b) Testbed**

Results on write errors, both in our LAN and on the testbed, are identical to those in Figure 9a. Snd performs the same actions to send a CEM. Read errors on the testbed are reported in Figure 10. We omit the plot corresponding to read errors in LAN, since for all tested values of t, the error rate was below 0.03%. Errors for both Snd and Rcv are due to packet loss.

### Bit Rate and Error Comparison

To simplify the comparison of techniques introduced in this paper, we combine the effective bit rate and corresponding error for all our protocols in Figure 11. Note that, for TDP, Snd’s effective bit rate can be multiplied by an arbitrary m, while Rcv’s bit rate should be divided by 2m. Analogously, the bit rate for both Snd and Rcv in the common-prefix protocol should be multiplied by m as discussed in Section 5.

### Security Analysis

#### Retroactive Privacy

An adversary (Adv) has a non-negligible advantage over 1/2 in the retroactive privacy game (see Section 3) only if it can infer information about a from interaction with Snd, Rcv, and Rt after the message Ma has expired. That is, Adv can only interact with protocol participants after content packets used to encode Ma have been removed from Rt’s PIT and from all caches.

Since Snd and Rcv delete Ma as soon as they (respectively) send and receive it, Adv cannot acquire information about Ma by compromising the two parties. Similarly, NDN routers do not keep track of content packets once they disappear from both PIT and cache. Therefore, after Ma expires, Rt carries no information about the message. As a result, there is simply no information about Ma within the network after the message expires.

#### Security Against Message-Recovery Attacks

To reconstruct a CEM, Adv can probe all NDN routers and try to identify content packets used for covert communication. However, this approach has two problems:
1. There is no content packet in routers' caches for a bit set to 0; therefore, Adv cannot learn information about these bits by simply observing routers' caches.
2. Even for a relatively small NDN deployment, the number of routers and the size of their caches make this attack infeasible.

Another adversarial strategy involves infiltrating the routing infrastructure: Adv could mount a Sybil attack [30], deploying a large number of malicious NDN routers. This approach is not feasible because:
1. Adv cannot deploy an arbitrary number of NDN routers. Even if NDN is implemented as an overlay, routers are identified by their unique IP address, forcing Adv to obtain a very large number of public IP addresses.
2. Even if the adversary succeeds in deploying a large number of routers, it must log all content packets forwarded by all controlled routers, which may not be feasible.
3. Similarly, even if Adv can compromise arbitrary routers, maintaining logs for all forwarded content packets would not be viable.

#### Detectability

To exchange a message through our protocols, Snd and Rcv do not need to communicate directly, nor do they need to be connected through the same NDN router. They only interact with the network as prescribed by NDN specifications.

A single-bit message b = 0 sent using single-bit transmission via cache or PIT cannot be detected, as Snd performs no action. When b = 1, Snd retrieves a non-popular content packet. In practice, flagging all single interests for non-popular content packets as "suspicious" would incur an overwhelmingly large number of false alarms. Similarly, a single interest issued by Rcv to retrieve b would be easily hidden by existing traffic.

When Snd and Rcv exchange messages longer than a single bit, their actions become more detectable. The longer the message, the more likely it is for Adv to correctly identify a CEM between two or more parties. A long streak of interests for non-popular content packets may be easy to notice. Therefore, Snd and Rcv should limit the size of the exchanged messages to reduce detectability.

Finally, with namespace-based covert communication, detectability mostly depends on m and the size of the covert. A higher value for m implies lower detectability, as fewer content packets have to be requested to write and read a covert message.

#### Robustness

When Rt introduces arbitrary delays to conceal cache hits, our techniques based on measuring the time difference between these two events do not work. However, techniques based on PIT and on common prefixes are not affected by cache hit delays, as they either do not rely on cache or do not consider RTT.

Similarly, when the network introduces unpredictable delays on packets (e.g., when traffic intensity has sudden wide fluctuations), the common-prefix-based technique may be more appropriate, as it does not rely on timing measurements.
