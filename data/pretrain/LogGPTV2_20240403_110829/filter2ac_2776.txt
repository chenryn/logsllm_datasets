To enhance email security, implement anti-spoofing and email authentication mechanisms. These measures help filter messages by verifying the sender's domain (using Sender Policy Framework, or SPF) and ensuring the integrity of the message (using DomainKeys Identified Mail, or DKIM). By enabling these mechanisms within your organization—such as through policies like Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)—you can enable both internal and external recipients to perform similar message filtering and validation.
