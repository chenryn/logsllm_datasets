benign nodes higher than Sybils, resulting in AUCs that are close to 0. However,
in practice, Sybils are less than benign nodes, as we discussed in Sect. 3.2.
Impact of n and k: Figure 4a and b show AUCs of SybilBlind vs. sampling
size n (k = 20) and the number of sampling trials k (n = 100,000) on the large
Twitter, respectively. We observe that the AUCs increase as the sampling size
and the number of sampling trials increase. The AUCs become stable after n
and k reach certain values. The AUCs are small when n or k is small, because
it is harder to sample training sets with relatively small label noise.
Running Time: We show running time of SybilBlind on the large Twitter. We
concurrently generate sampling trials using multiprocessing. In particular, we
create 4 processes in parallel, each of which runs one sampling trial. Moreover,
each sampling trial runs SybilSCAR using multithreading (20 threads in our
experiments). It took about 2 h for one process to run SybilSCAR in one sampling
trial, and the total time for our SybilBlind with 20 sampling trials is around 10 h.
7 Conclusion and Future Work
We design a novel structure-based framework called SybilBlind to detect Sybils
in online social networks without a manually labeled training dataset. We demon-
strate the eﬀectiveness of SybilBlind using both social networks with synthetic
Sybils and Twitter datasets with real Sybils. Our results show that Sybils can
be detected without manual labels. Future work includes applying SybilBlind to
detect Sybils with sampled subsets with diﬀerent sizes and extending SybilBlind
to learn general machine learning classiﬁers without manual labels.

A Performance of the Average Aggregator
Theorem 2. When SybilBlind uses the average aggregator, the expected aggre-
gated probability is 0.5 for every node.
Proof. Suppose in some sampling trial, the sampled subsets are B and S, and
SybilSCAR halts after T iterations. We denote by qu the prior probability and by
(t) the probability in the tth iteration for u, respectively. Note that the subsets
pu
(cid:3) = B are sampled by the sampler with the same probability. We
(cid:3) = S and S

the probability in the tth iteration

u = 1 − p(t)
Therefore, p(t)
u holds for every node u and iteration t. As a result,
(cid:3), SybilSCAR also halts after T iterations.
with the sampled subsets B
Moreover, the average probability in the two sampling trials (i.e., the sampled
(cid:3) = B) is 0.5 for every node. For each pair
subsets are B and S, and B
(cid:3) = B that
of sampled subsets B and S, there is a pair of subsets B
are sampled by our sampler with the same probability. Therefore, the expected
aggregated probability is 0.5 for every node.

Lower Bound: We have:
Pr(αb ≤ τ, αs ≤ τ ) ≥ Pr(αb = αs = 0) = (1 − r)
nrn.
(4)
We note that this lower bound is very loose because we simply ignore the
cases where Pr(0 < αb ≤ τ, 0 < αs ≤ τ). However, this lower bound is suﬃcient
to give us qualitative understanding.
Upper Bound: We observe that the probability that label noise in both the
benign region and the Sybil region are no bigger than τ is bounded by the
probability that label noise in the benign region or the Sybil region is no bigger
than τ. Formally, we have:
Pr(αb ≤ τ, αs ≤ τ ) ≤ min{Pr(αb ≤ τ ), Pr(αs ≤ τ )}
(5)
Next, we will bound the probabilities Pr(αb ≤ τ) and Pr(αs ≤ τ) separately.
We will take Pr(αb ≤ τ) as an example to show the derivations, and similar
derivations can be used to bound Pr(αs ≤ τ).
We observe the following equivalent equations:
Pr(αb ≤ τ ) = Pr(

nsb + nbb
≤ τ ) = Pr(τ nbb + (τ − 1)nsb ≥ 0)

if the ith node in S is benign

where i = 1, 2,··· , n. According to our deﬁnitions, we have Pr(Xi = τ) = 1 − r
and Pr(Yi = τ − 1) = 1 − r, where i = 1, 2,··· , n. Moreover, we denote S as the
sum of these random variables, i.e., S =
i=1 Yi. Then, the expected
value of S is E(S) = −(1 − 2τ)(1 − r)n. With the variables S and E(S), we can
further rewrite Eq. 6 as follows:
i=1 Xi +

(cid:5)n
Pr(αb ≤ τ ) = Pr(S − E(S) ≥ −E(S))

Pr(S − E(S) ≥ −E(S)) ≤ exp

(cid:10) − 2(1 − 2τ )2(1 − r)2n

(cid:11)

Similarly, we can derive an upper bound of P r(αs ≤ τ) as follows:
Pr(αs ≤ τ ) ≤ exp
(cid:10) − 2(1 − 2τ )2r2n
τ 2 + (1 − τ )2
(cid:11)
Since we consider r < 0.5 in this work, we have:
min{Pr(αb ≤ τ ), Pr(αs ≤ τ )} = exp
(cid:10) − 2(1 − 2τ )2(1 − r)2n
τ 2 + (1 − τ )2
(cid:11)

By combining Eqs. 5 and 8, we obtain Eq. 3.
