### Key changes
There are a few dozen bug fixes and changes in this release, but we've called
out the ones we think matter most:
  * Padding of `.navbar-collapse` and alignment of `.navbar-right:last-child` elements has been reworked.
  * Added a `max-width: 100%;` to `.container`s.
  * Restored the twelfth column's `float: left;` at all grid tiers.
See the list below for more information on those changes and more.
