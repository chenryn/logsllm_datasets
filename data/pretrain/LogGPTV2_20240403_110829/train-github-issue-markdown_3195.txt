Hello everyone,

I've encountered a frustrating bug in Visual Studio 2015 Update 2 while using TypeScript. The issue is with the autocomplete dialog, particularly when working with generics. It seems to treat the generic type as a greater-than comparison. Here are the details:

**TypeScript Version:**
1.8.30.0

**Code:**

```typescript
// Function declaration
function invoke<T>(methodName: string, ...args: any[]) {
}

// Call the function and type the first letter of the generic T.
invoke<M

// The autocomplete window pops up, which is expected.
// I select `Model` from the autocomplete window using "Enter".
invoke < Model

// Notice the inserted spaces. The compiler interprets it as a greater-than comparison, instead of recognizing it as a generic type.
```

**Expected Behavior:**

```typescript
// I expect `Model` to be inserted without spaces.
this.invoke<Model
```

**Actual Behavior:**

```typescript
// The actual result inserts `Model` with spaces.
this.invoke < Model
```

This behavior is causing issues with the code, as the spaces make the generic type invalid. Any insights or solutions would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!
