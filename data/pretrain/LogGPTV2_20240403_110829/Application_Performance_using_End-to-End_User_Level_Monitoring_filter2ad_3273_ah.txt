### 5.1 Independent Gaussian Stochastic Processes

Let \( V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_N \) be independent Gaussian stochastic processes with mean 0 and respective variances \(\sigma^2_1, \sigma^2_2, \ldots, \sigma^2_N\). The hierarchical nature of the model makes a hierarchical Bayesian model a suitable candidate for analyzing such data. However, due to the complexity of the model, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is required to carry out the analysis. We note that neither Model (2) nor Model (3) (to be described next) are implemented due to a lack of data. They will be validated in our future studies when data become available.

### 5.2 Delay Data from Multiple Monitoring Sites

When delay data are collected from multiple monitoring sites, a multivariate time series is formed. We assume that the multivariate time series is temporally and spatially correlated. The following model, which is an extension of Model (2) to incorporate spatial correlation, can be used to analyze such data:

\[
Y_{t,i} = \mu + \sum_{j=1}^{N} \left( A_j \sin \left( \frac{2\pi t}{T_j} \right) + B_j \cos \left( \frac{2\pi t}{T_j} \right) \right) + \epsilon_{t,i}
\]

where:
- \( Y_{t,i} \) is the delay at time \( t \) and location \( i \).
- \( \mu \) is the overall mean.
- \( A_j \) and \( B_j \) are the amplitudes of the sine and cosine components.
- \( T_j \) is the period.
- \( \epsilon_{t,i} \) is the error term, assumed to be Gaussian.

The concept of spatial location with respect to network topology is a new one. There are issues on how one defines location with respect to a network topology and how one defines distance in that context. Possible distance measures can be based on the number of in-between nodes, graph-theoretic distance, or bandwidth. Assuming these issues are resolved, we propose using an elementary space-time process for the "parameter processes" in Model (3). The elementary space-time process is generated by a continuous AR(1) process.

### 5.3 Analysis of Extended Delay Data

We predict the mean delay for times 218 to 672 using Model (1) and add random Gaussian noise to form the dataset for this section's analysis. The delay plot with control limits for Method (4) is given in Figure 6.

**Figure 6:**

The recommended approach would be to use time series regression as described in Model (1) in Section 5. We calculate the confidence band based on extended delay data. Figure 7 shows a zoomed-in view of the simultaneous confidence band derived using Model (1) in Section 5 on the extended delay data, showing only Week 4 (hours 505 to 672).

Note that no single point exceeds the upper confidence limit using Method (4). Furthermore, Method (4) implicitly assumes that all delays are independent, which is far from the truth in our case. This method performs even worse if there is a trend in the delay data. Specifically, if there is a downward trend in the delay data, what is actually an outlier server delay for the current time cannot be identified since it is absolutely within the normal range compared to previous weeks.
