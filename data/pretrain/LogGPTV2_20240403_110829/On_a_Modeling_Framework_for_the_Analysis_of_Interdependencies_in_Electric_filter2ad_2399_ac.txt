temporal evolution of the EI system in absence and in pres-
ence of ITCS.
4.1 Dynamic behavior of EPS
The hybrid-state of EI changes when the topology T of
the system or the values for V, F, I, A, P or Q change, i.e.,
when one of the following events occurs: disruption (in-
cluding failure of a local protection), activation of a protec-
tion local to EI, voltage or frequency regulation or recon-
ﬁguration action by ITCS (including erroneous, delayed or
not required action), maintenance actions on EI. Therefore,
the state of EI can also change due to actions by ITCS (both
correctly activated by an event in EI, or erroneously acti-
vated by a failure of ITCS). The discrete-state of ITCS can
change when one of the following events occurs: failure of
a component of ITCS, disruption of EI, recovery triggered
after a failure (in ITCS) or disruption (in EI).
To better describe the interaction between EI and ITCS,
we show in Figures 5 and 6 an example of a possible tem-
poral evolution of the EI system after a fault which breaks a
line, in absence and in presence of ITCS, respectively.

Figure 5. EI behavior in absence of ITCS
As in [8], let us denote with NORMAL, ALERT, EMER-
GENCY and IN EXTREMIS the set of operative states of
EI, where the criticality of the system increases from NOR-
MAL (situation in which all the constraints are satisﬁed)
to IN EXTREMIS (in which the service is partially or to-
tally interrupted). Each of these states can be described
with different combinations of values of the 7-tuple (T, V,
F, I, A, P, Q). At time 0, EI is in a state NORMAL S0 =
(T0, V0, F0, I0, A0, P0, Q0). At time tF , a disruption, due
to a tree fall, causes a loss of a line and EI moves to the de-
graded state ALERT SF = (TF , VF , FF , IF , AF , PF , QF ).

activations of protections isolate components of EI, and EI
moves into new degraded states until reaching, at time tC,
the state IN EXTREMIS, where the total service interrup-
tion cannot be avoided. In Figure 6, ITCS is also consid-
ered. Then, at time tF three types of activities of the com-

ponents LCT , RT S and N T S start on ITCS. When these
activities complete at the instants of time tLCT , tRT S and
tN T S, EI should move into a state less degraded than the
state in which EI would be without considering ITCS.

In the case shown in Figure 6, LCT is not able to re-
store EI, because global reconﬁguration is needed or be-
cause LCT is affected by an omission failure. The duration
of these activities and the state reconﬁguration to adopt can
be inﬂuenced by the state changes in EI due to the protec-
tions, at the instants of time tP1

depending on the current state of EI and on the probability
to move in an IN EXTREMIS state (if greater than a spe-
ciﬁc threshold), partial-reconﬁguration commands can be
activated, if possible, without waiting the end of the recon-
ﬁguration commands of RT S or N T S.

5 Prominent aspects of the framework
To model and analyze the interdependencies, the be-
havior of the involved system components has to be ﬁrstly
represented. Then, the derived models need to be solved,
through simulation or analytic techniques. To represent and
model the behavior of EI and ITCS and their interactions,
the following aspects should be considered.
Structural aspects. The system has a natural hierarchical
structure, as shown in the examples of logical schemes
of Section 2. At a certain level of detail, the system is
composed by many similar components having the same
logical structure (see Figure 2(b) for the logical components
NS, NG, NL and AL). Therefore, these components can
be grouped on the basis of their similarities. All similar
components can be considered non anonymous replicas
having the same structure but different values for the
parameters characterizing each speciﬁc component.
Behavioral aspects. The time to disruptions of the com-
ponents NS, NG, NL and AL depends also on the value
of the electric parameters associated to the components.
A disruption of a component can propagate to contiguous
components and the propagation time should not be con-
sidered instantaneous. Protections can stop the propagation
of a disruption by isolating from the grid the component
affected by a disruption. The activation time of a protection

The correct
activation of a protection depends also on the strength of
the disruption and on the value of the electric parameters
associated to the protection component. The reaction time
to the occurrence of a disruption, the failure time and erro-
neous activation time (when no disruptions have occurred)
of a component (e.g., LCT , RT S and N T S) should be
also considered. Moreover, the functions which implement
the reconﬁguration and regulation algorithms should be
considered. These functions receive in input the 7-tuple
(Ti, Vi, Fi, Ii, Ai, Pi, Qi) that
identiﬁes a situation in
which EI is not in equilibrium (that is it is not in NORMAL
state in terms of costs, voltage, etc.) and outputs the new
7-tuple (Te, Ve, Fe, Ie, Ae, Pe, Qe) for which the system
EI is in equilibrium (in NORMAL state), if possible. The
automatic evolution of the electric parameters in case of
instability events, e.g.
in correspondence of a power line
disruption, is modeled by the autoevolution function that
receives as input (Tj , Vj , Fj , Ij , Aj , Pj , Qj) and produces
in output the new values for the electric parameters.
To capture the above discussed structural and behavioral
aspects, the modeling and evaluation framework should
possess the following major characteristics, grouped into
three categories: modeling power aspects (the basic mod-
eling mechanisms required to build the EPS model), the
modeling efﬁciency aspects (the advanced modeling mech-
anisms required to build the EPS model more efﬁciently),
and the solution power aspects.
Concerning modeling power.
A1♦ EPS is a very complex system having subsystems (or
subcomponents) with very different characteristics. This
heterogeneity must also be addressed inside the framework
that, therefore, should support the deﬁnition of different
models using different formalisms, each one capable to
properly capture the behavior of a speciﬁc subsystem.
A2♦ The framework should support the representation of
continuous, discrete and hybrid state (see Section 4).
A3♦ The framework should support time and probability
distributions, and conditions enabling the time consuming
events (e.g., for the activation of a local protection) that can
depend both on the discrete and on the continuous state.
A4♦ The framework should support the call to the function
which implements the reconﬁguration and regulation algo-
rithms, as well as the autoevolution algorithm.
A5♦ Risk analysis of EPS based on a stochastic approach
requires the deﬁnition of measures of performability, which
is a uniﬁed measure proposed to deal simultaneously with
performance and dependability. To this purpose, a reward
structure can be set-up by associating proper costs/beneﬁts
to generators/loads and interruption of service supply.
Concerning modeling efﬁciency.
B1♦ As detailed in Section 2, the system has a hierarchical
structure; the modeling framework should support hierar-
chical composition of different sub-models.
B2♦ The model for the overall EPS could be facilitated
considering replication of (anonymous and not anonymous)
sub-models. The replicated and composed models should
share part of the state (common state).
B3♦ A compact representation of the topology of the grid
(T) is highly desirable, for example describing it as a matrix
(incidence matrix [nodes x arcs]).
B4♦ Compact representation of continuous states (for V,
F, I, A, P and Q) of EI is highly desirable, for example
describing them in terms of arrays, associating to each
component of the grid of EI (nodes and arcs) the values of
V, F, I, A, P and Q (if applicable).
Concerning solution power.
C1♦ The framework should support analytical solution of
the overall model (if possible). Actually, the huge system
complexity and its heterogeneity may inhibit the computa-
tion of the analytic solution due to the explosion of the states
of the model and stiffness. Moreover, an analytical solution
method could not exist for the class of models considered,
depending on the considered time distributions. Analytical
solutions may be applied for simpler sub-models.
C2♦ The framework should support simulation, by auto-
matic tools or ad hoc simulation software.
C3♦ The framework should support separate evaluation
of different sub-models (with analytic or simulation tech-
niques) and combination of the results.
6 Approaches to the EPS model construction
In this Section we address the problem of building the
overall model for the entire EPS, considering the logical
scheme of the electric grid shown in 2(b). The model
construction should consist of the following steps:
1) Deﬁnition of the models MN and MA, where MN is the
generic model for a node N of the grid (N=NS, NG, NL),
and MA is the generic model for an arc of the grid (A=AL).
2) Duplication of MN and MA for each speciﬁc component
N and A, and setting of the speciﬁc parameters.
3) Based on the topology T, manual connection of the
models MN and MA through a composition operator, for
each node N connected to an arc A.
When the number of components N and A is high, the
construction of the model based on the above approach can
be very expensive in terms of time and very error prone.
An alternative approach could be based on replication and
possibility to deﬁne part of the state of a system with an
37th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN'07)0-7695-2855-4/07 $20.00  © 2007array (for the incidence matrix [arcs x nodes]). In this case,
to build a model representing a topology like that shown
in Figure 2(b) for m nodes N and n arcs A, the following
steps should be required:
1) Deﬁne the model MN and MA for each generic compo-
nent N and arc A.
2) Deﬁne the discrete part of the state of MN and MA
by using a mxn matrix T [i, j] of binary values {0, 1},
where T [i, j] = 1 if the component i-th is connected to the
component j-th, otherwise T [i, j] = 0 (the values 1 and -1
can be used if it is needed to represent also the direction
of the arc, i.e., if T represents an oriented graph). The
time distributions and the conditions in the model MN can
depend on the values of T . In particular, the i-th replica
of MN (or the j-th replica of MA) can be deﬁned as a
function of T [i, j], and can modify T [i, j] (see below).
3) Deﬁne a hierarchical model by automatically replicating
m times the model MN , by assigning at each replica a
different index, from 1 to m. The state deﬁned with matrix
T is common to all the replicated sub-models MN . The
parameters of the i-th replica can depend on T [i, j].
4) Deﬁne a hierarchical model by automatically replicating
n times the model MA, by assigning at each replica a
different index, from 1 to n. The state deﬁned with matrix
T is common to all the replicated sub-models MA. The
replica j-th can depend on the values of the element T [i, j].
A compact representation of the electric parameters V, F,
I, A, P and Q can be obtained following the same approach.
7 Feasibility using SAN and M¨obius
In this Section we discuss the feasibility of the pro-
posed framework using M¨obius [4], a powerful multi-
formalism/multi-solution tool, and present the implemen-
tation of a few basic modeling mechanisms adopting the
Stochastic Activity Network (SAN) formalism [14], that is a
generalization of the Stochastic Petri Nets formalism. Here
the goal is not to provide a complete and detailed model rep-
resenting a concrete instance of an EPS system, but to show
how some basic framework’s characteristics can be actually
obtained. To this purpose, we describe the model construc-
tion of a simple instance of the EPS system, focusing on the
model for NS and the model for the overall EPS as compo-
sition of different submodels. A detailed description of the
other components models can be found in [3].
The number of components NG, NS, NL and AL of
EI is nG, nS, nL and nA respectively. These compo-
nents are represented by replicated SAN with index i, with
i ∈ [0, nG − 1] for NG, i ∈ [nG, nG + nS − 1] for
NS, i ∈ [nG + nS , nG + nS + nL − 1] for NL, i ∈
[nG + nS + nL, nG + nS + nL + nA − 1] for AL.
In Figure 7 the SAN for the component NS is shown. In
describing the SAN elements, we make explicit reference
to the framework’s characteristics, among those identiﬁed
in Section 5, here implemented as basic modeling mech-
anisms. The place N Sindex represents the index of the
component NS. The place N Scount is common to the
replicas of the SAN and contains nS tokens at time 0.
The extended place T is an arrayof array of nA × nN
short type, with nN = nG + nS + nL, and represents the
topology of the transmission grid and its state (A2♦, B3♦
of Section 5). The following value can be associated to
