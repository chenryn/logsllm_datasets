User: How to use Python to implement a network communication program based on UDP protocol?
Assistant: To use Python to implement a network communication program based on the UDP protocol, you can follow the steps below: 1. Import the socket module ```python import socket ``` 2. Create a UDP socket ```python udp_socket = socket.socket (socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM) ``` Among them, AF_INET means to use IPv4 protocol, SOCK_DGRAM means to use UDP protocol. 3. Bind the port number to be used ```python udp_socket.bind(('localhost', 8888)) ``` Among them, ('localhost', 8888) means to bind to port 8888 of the local address. 4. Receive data ```python data, addr = udp_socket.recvfrom(1024) ``` Among them, 1024 means receiving up to 1024 bytes of data each time. 5. Send data ```python udp_socket.sendto(data, addr) ``` The complete sample code of network communication program based on UDP protocol is as follows: ```python import socket udp_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket. SOCK_DGRAM) udp_socket.bind(('localhost', 8888)) while True: data, addr = udp_socket.recvfrom(1024) print('Received from', addr, ':', data) udp_socket.sendto(data, addr) ``` After running the program, you can use other programs to send data to port 8888 of localhost through UDP protocol, and the program will receive the data and return it as it is.
