##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug Report
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.1.0.0
      config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
      configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
##### CONFIGURATION
Bone stock
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
CentOS 7
##### SUMMARY
When lineinfile with regexp finds a match, it substitutes properly. When it
doesn't find a match (say, on subsequent runs), it just dumps the specified
line at the bottom of the file as if you hadn't specified a regexp. Needless
to say, this breaks idempotence.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
  1. Take a look at a file.
  2. Run lineinfile with regexp that matches a line
  3. See that your line was in fact replaced.
  4. Run lineinfile again.
  5. See that the specified replacement line is now duplicated at the bottom of the file.
    - name: Add ops scripts to sudo secure_path
      lineinfile:
        dest: /etc/sudoers
        regexp: >
          ^Defaults    secure_path = /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin$
        line: 'Defaults    secure_path = /opt/d7/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin'
        validate: visudo -cf %s
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
Idempotent line replacement after a second run
