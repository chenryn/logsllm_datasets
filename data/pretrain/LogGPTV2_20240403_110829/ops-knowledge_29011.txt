Subject: Issue with Running IPython on Windows PowerShell

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I recently installed PythonXY (version 2.7.9) and encountered an issue when attempting to run IPython via Windows PowerShell. The specific error message I received was "Failed to create process."

To resolve this, you may want to check if there are multiple versions of Python installed on your system, as this can sometimes cause conflicts. In my case, even after uninstalling one version of Python through the Control Panel, a residual folder (C:\Python2.7) remained. Manually deleting this leftover directory resolved the problem, allowing IPython to function correctly.

I hope this solution helps address your current challenge. If you have any further questions or require additional assistance, please do not hesitate to ask.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
