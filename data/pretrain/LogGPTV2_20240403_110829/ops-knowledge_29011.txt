User: I installed pythonxy (2.7.9), but when I try to run ipython from windows powershell, I get an error "failed to create process." What steps can I take to solve this problem. 
Thanks,
Assistant: I had this problem on Windows after I had 2 version of Python installed. Even after I uninstalled one version of Python through Control Panel, the folder C:\Python2.7 still existed. After I deleted this folder manually, ipython started work normally.
