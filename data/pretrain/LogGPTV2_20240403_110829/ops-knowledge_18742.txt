User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Remote Server: Please wait for the System Event Notification Service I was rebooting a remote server (Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard) over remote desktop and the session now shows the blue screen during the shutdown sequence, and the message "Please wait for the System Event Notification Service..."

It seems that everything is still running on the server (for instance, http://jeffhandley.com is still responding), but I need to get the machine to finish the reboot sequence.

How can I force the machine past this point?  It's been stuck there for about 30 minutes.

Assistant: This was happening with me on 2012 R2 as well. So,
For this you have to log in from another account with admin rights

Start &quot;Remote Desktop Services Manager&quot;
Identify the user ID in the Users tab
In the Processes tab sort by ID Go down to the user ID
Kill the winlogon.exe process with  the user ID, session will be logged off
Now you can log in again!

To Stop this from happening again,
see this article please wait for the system Event Notification service Problem.  This article states:

Yes, the issue with this was related to SSMS trying to send telemtry data back to Microsoft,  this was hanging and causing the process not to exit. The solution we went with was to disable the sending of telemetry all together using this registry key:
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\Telemetry]Name = DisableSqmUploader
Type = REG_DWORD
Data = 0000000
