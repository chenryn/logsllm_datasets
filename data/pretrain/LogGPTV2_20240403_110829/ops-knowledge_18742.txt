### Issue: Remote Server Reboot Stuck on "Please Wait for the System Event Notification Service"

**Problem Description:**
I was rebooting a remote server (Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard) via Remote Desktop, and now the session is stuck on a blue screen during the shutdown sequence with the message "Please wait for the System Event Notification Service...". The server appears to still be operational (e.g., `http://jeffhandley.com` is still responding), but I need to complete the reboot process. The machine has been stuck at this point for about 30 minutes.

**Solution:**

1. **Log In with Another Admin Account:**
   - Log in to the server using another account with administrative privileges.

2. **Use Remote Desktop Services Manager:**
   - Open the **Remote Desktop Services Manager**.
   - Navigate to the **Users** tab and identify the user ID that is currently logged in.
   - Switch to the **Processes** tab and sort by **ID**.
   - Locate the **winlogon.exe** process associated with the identified user ID.
   - Terminate the **winlogon.exe** process. This will log off the current session.

3. **Reconnect to the Server:**
   - You should now be able to log back into the server and complete the reboot process.

**Preventive Measure:**
To avoid this issue in the future, you can disable the sending of telemetry data, which is often the cause of the problem. Follow these steps:

1. **Edit the Registry:**
   - Open the **Registry Editor**.
   - Navigate to the following key:
     ```
     HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\Telemetry
     ```
   - Create or modify the **DisableSqmUploader** value:
     - **Name:** `DisableSqmUploader`
     - **Type:** `REG_DWORD`
     - **Data:** `00000001`

By disabling the telemetry, you can prevent the system from hanging during the shutdown sequence due to the System Event Notification Service.
