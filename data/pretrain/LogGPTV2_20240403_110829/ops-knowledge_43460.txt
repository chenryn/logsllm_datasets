User: I noticed this when using the delay() function to asynchronously send tasks. If I queue a task such as task.delay(("tuple",)), celery will store the argument as ["tuple"] and later the function will get the list back and not the tuple. Guessing this is because the data is being stored into json. 
This is fine for tuples, however I'm using namedtuples which can no longer be referenced properly once converted to a list. I see the obvious solution of switching the namedtuples out with dicts. Is there any other method? I couldn't seem to find anything in the configuration for celery.
I'm using redis as the broker.
Assistant: If you need to preserve the python native data structure I'd recommend using one of the serialization modules such a cPickle which will preserve the data structure but won't be readable outside of Python.
