### Synchronization and Interference Analysis in Chorus

#### Phase Variance and Synchronization
When the oscillators are perfectly synchronized, the phase difference between them is zero. Any deviation from this perfect synchronization will result in a non-zero phase difference, which can be used to quantify the synchronization error. The figure below demonstrates that the variance in the phase difference remains below 0.0022 radians, even as the number of transmitters in Layer 1 increases from 1 to 10. This low phase variance indicates that Chorus can maintain good synchronization without a single leader, even when multiple small cells contribute to the synchronization signal.

**Note:** All nodes in Layer 1 transmit synchronization signals.

#### Performance at an Auxiliary Node
The performance of Chorus at an auxiliary node is analyzed as a function of the number of joint transmitters in an intermediate synchronization layer. 

- **Phase Variance (Figure 4a):** The phase variance observed at an auxiliary node remains constant and low, even as the number of transmitters in the intermediate synchronization layer increases.
- **Interference-to-Noise Ratio (INR) (Figure 4b):** The INR stays below 0.5 dB for up to 10 simultaneous transmitters. This demonstrates that Chorus's strategy of having all nodes in the system transmit the synchronization signal provides robust synchronization.

#### Impact of Synchronization SNR
The performance at an auxiliary node is also evaluated as a function of the synchronization Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).

- **Phase Variance (Figure 5a):** The variance in phase between the signals received from two small cells at an auxiliary node is plotted.
- **INR (Figure 5b):** The median INR for various synchronization SNRs is shown. Chorus can achieve a median INR less than 1 dB even for synchronization SNRs as low as 6 dB.

- **(b)** Median INR as a function of synchronization SNR.

#### Implications of Phase Variance on Interference
To understand the impact of phase variance on interference, consider the scenario where distributed MIMO aims to eliminate interference by nulling the transmitted signals at a particular receiver. If the transmitters are perfectly phase coherent, they can compensate for the channel effects and align the signals to eliminate interference. Any phase variance introduces phase noise, leading to misalignment and residual interference. The measurements show that the residual interference to noise ratio is 0.5 dB, which is small and comparable to previous systems. This indicates that Chorus, despite having no single leader, can achieve high performance similar to past systems that relied on a single leader.

#### Resilience to Varying Synchronization Link Quality
Chorus's performance as a function of the synchronization link SNR is crucial for two reasons:
1. **Layer Joining:** Chorus nodes join the lowest numbered layer with an adequately strong synchronization signal. Calibrating performance across SNRs helps determine the threshold value.
2. **Robustness:** Chorus aims to work robustly across a range of synchronization SNRs to ensure resilience to variations in link quality.

For this experiment, nodes are deployed such that the layering algorithm divides the network into three layers. Two small cell nodes in Layer 2, synchronizing to a node in Layer 1, are chosen to measure the phase difference and evaluate synchronization accuracy.

**Results:**
- **Phase Variance (Figure 5a):** Even at a synchronization link SNR as low as 6 dB, the median phase variance remains below 0.0045.
- **INR (Figure 5b):** The median INR is very small, less than 1 dB for synchronization SNRs larger than 6 dB.

**Figures 5(a) and (b):** By setting the minimum synchronization link SNR to 6 dB, Chorus ensures that the maximum interference is less than 1 dB.

#### Synchronizing Nodes That Cannot Hear Each Other
Chorus's architecture allows it to synchronize nodes that are not within listening range of each other by cascading the synchronization signal across layers. For this experiment, nodes are deployed such that the network is divided into four layers (Layers 0 through 3). Nodes in Layer 3 cannot hear nodes in Layer 1. The objective is to investigate whether nodes in Layer 1 and Layer 3 have accurately synchronized their oscillators.

**Results:**
- **Phase Variance (Figure 6):** The quality of synchronization remains high even as the SNR of the synchronization signal drops.

- **Phase variance between small cells that cannot hear each other, as a function of synchronization SNR.**

#### Comparison with Leader-Based Distributed MIMO
In this section, Chorus's fully distributed protocol is compared empirically with MegaMIMO, a leader-based distributed MIMO system. MegaMIMO is designed for Wi-Fi networks but can be extended to small cells. The data plane does not need to change since both Wi-Fi and LTE operate over OFDM. For the control plane, MegaMIMO designates a leader node to transmit the synchronization signal.

This comparison highlights the advantages of Chorus's distributed approach in terms of robustness and performance across varying network conditions.
