## Abstract
Customer edge (CE) routers serve as the primary gateway to the Internet for many non-commercial users. As these networks transition from IPv4 to IPv6, stateful firewalls are essential for protecting home devices. However, the implementation details of these inbound access controls are left to the discretion of device manufacturers. This paper surveys ten CE routers to evaluate how manufacturers implement firewalls and user controls in IPv6. Our findings reveal a systemic failure among all parties to agree upon, implement, and communicate consistent security policies. We conclude with future research directions and recommendations to address these systemic failures and provide a consistent model for home security.

## 1. Introduction
For over two decades, IPv4 network address translation (NAT) has been the standard operational template for CE routers across various hardware manufacturers. Driven by Internet growth and address scarcity, the widespread use of NAT, combined with RFC 1918 addressing, provided a common behavioral standard [20, 21]. While unintentional, NAT effectively isolates internal devices from external threats, providing automatic and default attack surface reduction.

In contrast, IPv6 provides sufficient address space for individual devices to receive their own public, globally-routable addresses, eliminating the need for NAT. The IETF offers little guidance on firewall configurations [3, 16], allowing router manufacturers to implement filtering policies at their discretion. With approximately two-thirds of consumer devices maintaining default settings [6] or failing to keep up with system or security updates [17], the exposure of internal devices to external threats becomes dependent on the router's design. Without a default security perimeter, once-protected devices within a home network now rely on consumers to either individually maintain each device or implement a technical solution, such as detailed firewall rules, on their own.

In this work, we conduct the first study of IPv6 CE routers to examine how manufacturers are implementing filtering and access control for IPv6 residential networks. We assess ten popular CE routers to evaluate their default firewall policies and the ability for consumers to implement custom rules. Our findings show inconsistency in the implementation of default configurations, overexposure of services, and a lack of communication to consumers about the baseline policy of a device. As a result, in cases where no default firewall is enabled, consumers may be unaware of the exposure of their devices, and developers may incorrectly assume that a device’s services are not exposed to the Internet.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we provide an overview of IPv6 features, operational considerations, and competing security paradigms. We then present our methodology for assessing IPv6 implementation in CE routers across a spectrum of features and configurations in Section 3 before presenting our results in Section 4. We discuss the necessity for a single device baseline standard and recommend consistent messaging in Section 5. Finally, we conclude in Section 6.

## 2. Background
Although functionally similar to IPv4, IPv6 introduces several impactful changes to the typical consumer network. In this section, we provide a brief history of the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 and cover key differences between the two protocols and their potential impact on consumers.

### 2.1 IPv4 NAT
NAT shaped the CE routing environment for two primary reasons: First, the scalability of NAT delayed the eventual address exhaustion of IPv4 during a period of explosive Internet growth, providing a simple path to connect more devices. ISPs, who manage public address distribution, effectively required CE routers to support NAT by allocating one public IP per household gateway [8]. Second, the simplicity of NAT lowered the barrier for non-technical users to operate their own networks. Home networks often rely on default configurations, and NAT allowed CE routers to provide simple or automatic initialization with minimal configuration beyond SSID, WPA password, and ISP-specific settings [4]. Once established, protocols like UPnP and STUN provided an interface for connected devices to negotiate with the router directly, reducing the need for user interaction [7, 16, 19]. NAT also removed the need to define and manage an ingress filtering policy, as the single public address was multiplexed for all internal hosts. The prevalence of NAT became synonymous with the default-deny ingress policy, which is the de facto security model for CE networks.

However, the motivation for NAT in IPv4 is negated by a core feature of IPv6: the elimination of address shortages. With IPv6, inbound access controls are discretionary, and CE networks can operate without the network perimeters and default access control necessitated by NAT. While the IETF acknowledges the need for careful design in CE routers, they avoid proposing default configurations due to the tension between transparent end-to-end connectivity and the need to detect and prevent unauthorized access [20]. The IETF recommends that manufacturers include a toggle to allow customers to choose between an open, unfiltered gateway or a closed perimeter approach, similar to NAT [3, 20]. In the absence of standardization or documentation of defaults, consumers must assess whether the security model implemented by their network is sufficient.

### 2.2 IPv6 Reachability
A significant consideration in the adoption of IPv6 is the ability to uniquely address each device joining the Internet. No longer defined by NAT architectures and private subnets, this addressing allows every device to be globally reachable. Devices designed for the home environment often pose a serious risk when exposed to the open Internet [2, 9, 10]. However, being globally reachable does not automatically imply global accessibility.

The IETF's RFCs give router manufacturers discretion for handling unsolicited inbound traffic in IPv6. The two basic options for default policies are:
- **Default Deny:** Drop all unsolicited WAN-to-LAN inbound traffic. Users can manually add firewall exceptions or rely on protocols that allow exceptions to be negotiated directly with the router. This policy resembles the existing model of IPv4 networks with NAT and UPnP.
- **Default Permit:** Allow unsolicited inbound WAN-to-LAN traffic. Devices are globally accessible, offloading the responsibility for filtering unwanted traffic to each individual device. This model simplifies the deployment of Internet-capable devices without the need for additional security mechanisms.

Whichever default policy is used, the mental model that users employ must change from that of IPv4. If a user wishes to manually configure an exception to the ingress policy, they must understand the subtle differences between NAT and individually globally-addressed devices. For example, individual devices in IPv6 can have multiple addresses assigned concurrently, and those addresses may be link-local or transient. To administer their IPv6 network, users must understand technical details about IPv6 operation and firewall behavior. This is further complicated by the lack of common nomenclature or abstractions for configuration tasks across different manufacturers. A study of enterprise IPv6 networks found that even enterprise operators have difficulty implementing appropriate controls [5]. These challenges do not imply that there is anything inherently wrong with IPv6; the same model provided by IPv4 NAT can be implemented in IPv6 [18]. However, they highlight the need to provide a common expectation for baseline operation.

The flexibility of implementation among CE routing devices, combined with globally reachable addressing, creates a potential issue: unlike IPv4 networks, IPv6 CE routers are free to expose all internal endpoints. Furthermore, as devices transition from IPv4 to IPv6, this exposure could occur without any communication to the end user. Because inbound access control implementation is left to the discretion of manufacturers, we suspect that there is variance among implementations. In the next section, we describe our methodology for evaluating a set of off-the-shelf CE routers to assess how IPv6 access control is implemented in practice.

## 3. Methodology
Our study aims to measure the security implementation of consumer-grade gateways and the configuration options they provide for IPv6. In this section, we describe our methodology for selecting and evaluating these routers.

### 3.1 Router Selection and Network Configuration
To choose routers representative of those deployed in real networks, we relied on the work of Kumar et al., who provide insight into the most commonly used global gateways by manufacturer and region [10]. Out of 4,800 router vendors globally, we selected 12 routers covering 25.2% of the most commonly deployed global brands. Only routers that specifically mention compatibility with IPv6 were chosen for our comparison. We were unable to find any routers that advertise or provide messaging about filtering policies. To evaluate potential differences within a manufacturer, we included multiple Linksys (EA3500 and EA6350) routers. Two of the selected routers (the Tenda AC18 and the Wavlink Aerial G2) were excluded because they did not actually support IPv6 upon arrival. The remaining ten devices used in our assessment are shown in Table 1 in Section 4.

Our architecture consists of four key elements marked with letters in Figure 2. Two vantages were established to assess traffic flows: an external host located on a public cloud provider (A) scanning across a public ISP toward the firewall (B) or internal host (C), and an internal vantage (D) conducting the same scans focused outbound (with the exception of targeting an external host due to the ubiquitous outbound permit policy of the firewalls). All devices sending and receiving probes associated with scans were under our control at all times, and we did not perform any scanning or analysis of public or private systems outside of our controlled scope. This architecture allowed us to pass traffic across the public internet via local consumer-grade ISPs and through the assessed routers from different vantages to analyze real-world operational modes.

### 3.2 Evaluation Methodology
To allow unsolicited inbound connections (e.g., peer-to-peer connections), IPv4 routers must provide the ability to port forward. The router establishes a list of port numbers and destination (internal) addresses. When a packet is received on the public interface at a port in the list, the router bypasses any NAT lookup and immediately rewrites the destination address and forwards the packet internally. Forwarding is common in IPv4; devices rely on UPnP and NAT-PMP protocols to automate the setup of forwarding rules. Without these protocols, users would need to manually create such rules, a technical task requiring knowledge of IP addresses and TCP/UDP ports.

In IPv6, forwarding is effectively meaningless without NAT, as devices can be addressed directly. Instead, routers must provide a mechanism to create firewall exceptions if a firewall is implemented. While these rules can be as simple as port forwarding rules (e.g., a destination IP and a port number), how they are implemented and the options available to users may vary. We evaluate the following basic characteristics of each router:

- **Default IPv6 Support:** We check if each router supports IPv6 and whether it enables that support by default. When IPv6 is enabled by default, IPv6-capable devices on the internal network automatically request addresses. Default IPv6 support requires that the upstream ISP also supports IPv6. It is notable that router support for IPv6 and the default enable state can be changed in a firmware update pushed remotely by the manufacturer, and ISPs can (and do) add support for IPv6 without notifying consumers. Therefore, devices in the home environment can transition to IPv6 overnight without the user’s knowledge.
- **Firewall Presence:** We evaluate whether the device implements a firewall. In cases where a firewall is not present, the device will pass all traffic to internal hosts.
- **Firewall Enabled:** If a firewall is present, we evaluate whether it is enabled (i.e., filtering) by default.
- **One-Click Open:** While RFC 7084 refrains from proposing a default IPv6 ingress filter policy for consumer gateways, it advises that gateways implement a single button to toggle all firewall ingress filtering [16]. We evaluate whether the device includes this functionality.
- **Security Warning:** When the One-Click Open option is used, we evaluate if there is any warning or communication to the user about the danger of disabling the firewall.
- **Rule Generation:** We evaluate whether each device includes the ability to create exceptions to the default firewall policy. Such rules may be necessary for allowing specific services or applications to function in the presence of a firewall. Because we are comparing to existing functionality in IPv4 networks, we specifically exclude examining more expressive firewall capabilities than IP/device/port tuples.
- **IP Specification:** We evaluate whether rule creation specifies an individual IP as the destination.
- **Device Specification:** As IPv6 devices are often assigned multiple addresses (in some cases, one per application), creating a rule may be complicated by device/address identification. We evaluate whether rules can be created by specifying a device (e.g., by MAC address or another identifier) rather than a specific IP address.
- **IPv6 UPnP Support:** Finally, we evaluate the router’s capability to offer automatic rule generation. Devices on the local network can use UPnP to create firewall rules programmatically if the router offers this capability.

Since routers do not explicitly advertise their firewall policies, we conducted a series of black-box scans to establish the default filtering model, firewall filtering policies, and hosted router services. We designed and built a custom traffic monitor on the internal host to ensure accurate collection of packets arriving through the firewall. During a scan, this monitor listened for and recorded inbound IPv6 traffic with a timestamp, arrival port, protocol, and scanning source IP. We reconciled the packets received with packets sent from the scanner to filter unwanted traffic and verify correct operation.

Scans were conducted using Nmap against the most common 1,000 TCP and UDP ports (as defined by the scanner). This scope was chosen due to interest in the exposure of the most common ports and scan duration considerations. A complete assessment of each CE router involved nine total scans from two sources, each conducted with the firewall on and off as shown in Figure 2: 
1. Scan (1) is conducted from the external vantage to the internal host, establishing the inbound filtering strategy of the firewall.
2. Scan (2) probes the external router interface from the external vantage to identify open ports and exposed services.
3. Scan (3) repeats this scan on the internal interface to determine if this traditionally concealed interface is exposed under IPv6.
4. Banner scans (4 and 5) are conducted against exposed ports.
5. The process is repeated from the internal vantage, first targeting the exposed services on each router interface (scans 6 and 7) before conducting the same banner grab on exposed services (scans 8 and 9).

The combination of sources and targets allowed complete measurement of IPv6 filtering policies, exposure, and the default operational model of the CE router. These results were then compared with our evaluation of basic router characteristics to complete a holistic router assessment, presented in Section 4: Results.
