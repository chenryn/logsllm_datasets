Question: "You are tasked with setting up an environment for Android application security testing. Considering the factors such as speed, cost, ease of root detection, and hardware interaction, which setup would you recommend and why?"
 "A": "Use a physical Android device due to its faster operation, easier interaction with hardware features, and more challenging root detection."
 "B": "Opt for an emulator because it offers faster operation and is typically rooted by default, providing a more realistic testing environment."
 "C": "Prefer a commercial emulator like Genymotion, as it is the official Android emulator that offers enhanced features appropriate for app testing."
 "D": "Employ an Android Virtual Device (AVD) for its ability to easily change SDK versions and create multiple devices, despite its typically slow operation."
