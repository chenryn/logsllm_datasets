Both are providing support for static linking and link-time optimization. A
300% increase in size with no increase in scope of the libraries is quite bad.
The standard library itself went from 39M to 42M but this can be explained by
the added features and some cases of temporarily duplicated code like `Vec`
and `~[T]`. I have not yet investigated the exact cause of the enormous
increase in size.
