## Abstract
The field of information security is rich with tools and solutions, capable of incrementally and selectively addressing complex challenges. However, the practical application of these scientific advancements, and the general understanding of the existing science, remains disappointingly poor. As our reliance on information technology, such as the Internet, continues to grow, so does the threat of well-planned, coordinated attacks. Scientific progress has provided us with the means to deploy systems with verifiable protection, and a clear understanding of how to leverage this protection to meet critical security needs. Yet, the community lacks the discipline, tenacity, and will to implement these systems effectively. Instead, we often turn to pseudoscientific approaches and unrealistic expectations. In summary, while the state of computer and network security science is robust, it suffers from significant neglect.

## 1. Introduction
The fundamental principles of computer and network information security have remained relatively stable over the past two decades. This stability is not surprising, given that the core concepts of information theory and the limits of computability are not subject to frequent change.

The science of computer and network security has long enabled us to purchase an information system from a hostile entity, assess its ability to enforce a well-defined security policy, and gain sufficient assurance to use it confidently. This capability, known as "verified protection," has been successfully implemented in practice.

In contrast, the pseudoscience of computer security has evolved primarily in terms of its commercial success. The same flawed solutions continue to be marketed, but on a much larger scale. The pursuit of pseudoscience remains a lucrative source of research funding and product revenue. Unfortunately, this growth has come at the expense of genuine scientific advancements, which have been largely abandoned and declared unworkable by a community that often overlooks successful examples. As a result, our ability to achieve verified protection in deployed systems peaked around the mid-1990s.

Figures 1 and 2 illustrate some of the troubling trends. As more businesses recognize their need for secure systems and seek out "experts," the percentage of those experts who truly understand the complexities of the field is declining (Figure 1). Simultaneously, the availability of highly secure systems is decreasing, while the market is flooded with products offering weak security (Figure 2).

## 2. Critical Areas of Focus
This essay aims to critically examine the current state of computer and network security science, drawing on the author's extensive experience in the field. Before delving into the scientific advancements that preceded the current decline, it is important to define verified protection, acknowledge the remaining challenges, and discuss what verified protection can and cannot achieve. Additionally, we will explore how verified protection can be leveraged within systems to address seemingly intractable problems.

### 2.1. Verifiable Protection
Malicious software is the primary tool used in well-planned, professional attacks and is the main threat addressed by systems offering verified protection. To counter this threat, such systems must be designed and built with the following properties:

- **No Exploitable Security Flaws:** The system must be designed to be free of any vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
- **Enforcement of Security Policies:** The system must enforce security policies on information flow, thereby limiting the damage caused by malicious applications (e.g., Trojan Horses).
- **Third-Party Inspection and Analysis:** The system must be built to allow third-party inspection and analysis to confirm that the protections are correct, complete, and do not include hidden backdoors.

The scientific foundations of information security provide three essential tools for achieving verifiable protection:

- **Identification of Needs and Possibilities:** The ability to identify situations where verified protection is both necessary and feasible, including the distinction between discretionary and mandatory security policies.
- **Implementation and Fielding of Heterogeneous Systems:** The tools and techniques to implement and deploy systems where only some components require verified protection.
- **Independent Verification:** Criteria and methods to independently verify the protections offered by such systems.

While verified protection is sufficient to address many serious security challenges, it is not a panacea. There are still areas that require further research and development.

### 2.2. Remaining Hard Problems
Several significant challenges remain in the field of information security:

- **Verification of Hardware Integrity:** Ensuring that hardware, especially with the increasing use of automated design, is free from trap doors. It is estimated that a product designed to prevent subversion could cost 50 to 100 times as much as non-secure alternatives. Potential solutions include using cleared programmers, similar to practices employed by the NSA.
- **Verification of Development Tools:** Ensuring that development tools like compilers and linkers are free from trap doors and other malicious software.
- **Covert Timing Channels:** These remain a problem, though there are demonstrated methods to significantly reduce them.
- **Covert Channels in End-to-End Encryption Systems:** These, such as those found in Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), pose a significant challenge.
- **Formal Methods for Code Correspondence:** Despite some progress, we lack formal methods to meaningfully correspond source code to a formal specification and object code to source.
- **Denial of Service Attacks:** While these can be mitigated, they cannot be completely eliminated.

### 2.3. Omniscient Classification of Information
The inability to omnisciently classify the confidentiality or integrity of information is perhaps the most visible and intractable problem in information security. This issue is likely to persist, making malicious email attachments a continuing threat. The problem of "rotten apples" in a barrel—where one compromised user can affect the entire system—remains unsolved. Users often prefer the convenience of sharing the same integrity domain, even if it means being vulnerable to the least conscientious and least informed among them. One solution is to consciously decide which domain to inhabit at different times, as General Motors did by establishing parallel domains for engineering data and general use.

### 2.4. Success Through Divide and Conquer
History has shown that we do not need to solve all security problems simultaneously to create secure systems. The ability to divide and conquer has led to significant advancements. A key innovation in computer security science is the partitioning of systems into elements that enforce the security policy (the Trusted Computing Base, or TCB) and those that do not. This allows for a subset of the system to offer verified protection, while the rest, including most operating system functions and applications, do not need to.

As systems become more complex, the Internet has introduced new challenges but also opportunities. The adoption of line protocols as the primary system interface has simplified compatibility issues, enabling heterogeneous systems and the selective use of secure appliances like Certificate Authorities. The Internet can also benefit from the adoption of the IPSEC standard, which, if combined with secure key management protocols, can significantly enhance security. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) holds promise for managing IPSEC keys, but it introduces new vulnerabilities that must be addressed to avoid falling into pseudoscience.

## Conclusion
The state of information security science is strong, but it is underutilized and often overshadowed by pseudoscientific approaches. By focusing on verified protection and leveraging the divide-and-conquer strategy, we can make significant strides in securing our information systems. However, this requires a commitment to rigorous scientific principles and a willingness to implement and maintain robust security measures.
