### Steps to reproduce this issue
When I try to use RpcContext.getServerContext to pass data from provider to
cusumer，if the method runs in sync mode, it works（ Provider uses
RpcContext.getServerContext().setAttachment to set Key-Value data，then
Consumer uses RpcContext.getServerContext().getAttachment to get the Key-Value
Data.). But if the method runs in async mode, it doesn't works. Consumer can't
get the Key-Value by RpcContext.getServerContext().getAttachment.
