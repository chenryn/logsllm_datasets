How can I force the removal of this volume?

Thanks,

Assistant: What does the logical volume contain? Is it a filesystem (I accidentally wrote partition)? Could it be it's mounted? In that case:

umount /dev/my-volumes/volume-1

Does it have any active snapshots?

Edit: try lvchange -an -v /dev/my-volumes/volume-1 and lvremove -vf /dev/my-volumes/volume-1.

Edit 2: please post 'lvs'.

Edit 3: Try this with some other problematic volume. It's not the cleanest option but according to this site it may work, and it's less problematic than rebooting anyway.

dmsetup remove my--volumes-volume--number
lvremove /dev/my-volumes/volume-number
