User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Preventing User Enumeration on Registration Page You have a website that users log into, and you want to prevent user enumeration.

On the login page and the forgotten password page, this can be achieved by careful choice of user messages, but what about the new user registration page? You want to ensure that creating an account for an existing user is impossible, but this tells an attacker that the account already exists, allowing enumeration.

What mechanisms can be used to prevent user enumeration on new user registration?

Assistant: Since the username is the public part, it isn't the end of the world if it can be enumerated, however if you really do want to avoid this, the easiest thing is to have them use e-mail address as the username. Then you simply say that you sent a link to the e-mail no matter if they have an account already or not.
