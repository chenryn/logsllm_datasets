Subject: Issue with Downloaded Customized Bootstrap Version

Dear Support Team,

I recently downloaded a customized version of Bootstrap and extracted the files. However, I noticed that the `css` folder contains only two `error.txt` files instead of the expected CSS files.

The `error.txt` file includes the following message:

```
A LESS error occurred while trying to build your bundle. You've likely entered an invalid input into the LESS variable field. Please check your syntax and try again!

Error Details:
- Type: Parse
- Message: Missing opening `{`
- Filename: bootstrap.css
- Index: 374741
- Line: 6383
- Column: 0
- Extract: ["}", "", null]
```

Could you please provide guidance on how to resolve this issue and successfully download my customized CSS version?

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
