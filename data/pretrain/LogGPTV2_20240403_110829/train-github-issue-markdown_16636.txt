Just now i download the Bootstrap Customized version and extract the file, in
css folder contains only the two error.txt files.
In that error.txt file contain:-  
A less error occured trying to build your bundle. You've likely entered an
invalid input into the less variable field. Check your syntax and try again!
thanks!

`{`","filename":"bootstrap.css","index":374741,"line":6383,"column":0,"extract":["}","",null]}
