### Apache Airflow Version
2.3.3

### Issue Description
During the upgrade process from version 2.2.3 to 2.3.3 using MySQL, the `airflow db upgrade` command got stuck at the step `Running upgrade c97c2ab6aa23 -> 4eaab2fe6582, Migrate RTIF to use run_id and map_index`. The upgrade failed with an error indicating a duplicate column name 'run_id' in the `rendered_task_instance_fields` table.

### Steps Taken
To proceed with the upgrade, I manually executed several SQL commands to resolve previous issues. Here are the steps I have taken so far:

```sql
USE airflow;

-- Add foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE task_reschedule
ADD CONSTRAINT `task_reschedule_ti_fkey` FOREIGN KEY (`dag_id`, `task_id`, `run_id`) REFERENCES `task_instance` (`dag_id`, `task_id`, `run_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Add index
ALTER TABLE task_reschedule
ADD KEY `idx_task_reschedule_dag_task_run` (`dag_id`,`task_id`,`run_id`);

-- Add primary key
ALTER TABLE `task_instance` 
ADD PRIMARY KEY (`dag_id`,`task_id`,`run_id`);

-- Drop columns
ALTER TABLE task_instance DROP COLUMN map_index;
ALTER TABLE task_reschedule DROP COLUMN map_index;
ALTER TABLE rendered_task_instance_fields DROP COLUMN map_index;

-- Modify character set and collation
ALTER TABLE task_instance MODIFY `task_id` VARCHAR(250) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin;
ALTER TABLE task_reschedule MODIFY `task_id` VARCHAR(250) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin;
ALTER TABLE rendered_task_instance_fields MODIFY `dag_id` VARCHAR(250) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin;
```

### Error Log
The error log at the point of failure is as follows:

```plaintext

(Background on this error at: http://sqlalche.me/e/14/e3q8)
```

### Current Table Schema
The current schema of the `rendered_task_instance_fields` table is:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `rendered_task_instance_fields` (
  `dag_id` varchar(250) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin NOT NULL,
  `task_id` varchar(250) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin NOT NULL,
  `rendered_fields` json NOT NULL,
  `k8s_pod_yaml` json DEFAULT NULL,
  `run_id` varchar(250) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`dag_id`,`task_id`,`run_id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
```

It appears that the `execution_date` column was dropped during the migration. To verify this, I tested with both Airflow 2.2.5 and 2.3.3 in Docker. The `execution_date` column is present in 2.2.5 but not in 22.3.3.

### Expected Behavior
The migration should complete successfully without errors, as it did in previous Airflow upgrades.

### Reproduction Steps
To reproduce the issue, you need to have data in MySQL tables created by Airflow version 2.2.3 (or earlier versions, as we have been running Airflow since 1.10.x) and attempt to upgrade to version 2.3.3.

### Environment
- **Operating System**: Using Docker image `apache/airflow:2.3.3-python3.9`
- **Database**: MySQL 8 in RDS (AWS)
- **Deployment**: Other 3rd-party Helm chart
