ABSTRACT
Modern afﬁliate marketing networks provide an infrastructure for
connecting merchants seeking customers with independent mar-
keters (afﬁliates) seeking compensation. This approach depends
on Web cookies to identify, at checkout time, which afﬁliate should
receive a commission. Thus, scammers “stuff” their own cookies
into a user’s browser to divert this revenue. This paper provides
a measurement-based characterization of cookie-stufﬁng fraud in
online afﬁliate marketing. We use a custom-built Chrome exten-
sion, AffTracker, to identify afﬁliate cookies and use it to gather
data from hundreds of thousands of crawled domains which we ex-
pect to be targeted by fraudulent afﬁliates. Overall, despite some
notable historical precedents, we found cookie-stufﬁng fraud to
be relatively scarce in our data set. Based on what fraud we de-
tected, though, we identify which categories of merchants are most
targeted and which third-party afﬁliate networks are most impli-
cated in stufﬁng scams. We ﬁnd that large afﬁliate networks are
targeted signiﬁcantly more than merchant-run afﬁliate programs.
However, scammers use a wider range of evasive techniques to tar-
get merchant-run afﬁliate programs to mitigate the risk of detection
suggesting that in-house afﬁliate programs enjoy stricter policing.

INTRODUCTION
Afﬁliate marketing is a popular form of pay-per-action or pay-
per-sale advertising whereby independent marketers are paid a com-
mission on “converting trafﬁc” (e.g., clicks that culminate in a sale).
Heralded as the “the holy grail” of online advertising a decade
ago [17], afﬁliate marketing has become prevalent across the Web,
complementing more traditional forms of display advertising.
Often described as a “low-risk” proposition for merchants who
pay out only upon successful completion of sales, afﬁliate market-
ing attracts signiﬁcant investment from almost every major online
retailer, some of whom also invest in multiple third-party afﬁliate
advertising programs. Similarly, it is an attractive proposition for
independent marketers as they can create online content (e.g., book
reviews) that can be monetized simultaneously as a means to at-
tract likely converting trafﬁc and to host contextual advertising. Of
the two approaches, afﬁliate marketing is frequently the more prof-
itable option with earnings typically between 4 and 10% of sales
revenue [2, 18].
Like almost all economic activity on the Web, afﬁliate market-
ing also attracts the attention of fraudsters looking to make easy
cash. Afﬁliate fraud garnered widespread media attention in 2013
with the indictment of Shawn Hogan, an EBay afﬁliate indicted for
wire fraud of $28M through the use of a technique called cookie-
stufﬁng [8] whereby the Web cookies used to determine the likely
source of user trafﬁc are overwritten without the user’s knowledge.
There have been multiple similar legal disputes over afﬁliate mar-
keting since then [6]. Besides media attention, afﬁliate marketing
has also been a subject of academic research to understand the in-
centives in the ecosystem and the extent of afﬁliate fraud [7, 16].
In this paper, we characterize popular cookie-stufﬁng techniques.
From crawling likely sources of cookie-stufﬁng, we ﬁnd that large
afﬁliate networks such as CJ Afﬁliate (formerly Commission Junc-
tion) and Rakuten LinkShare (recently renamed to Rakuten Afﬁli-
ate Network) are implicated in cookie-stufﬁng orders of magnitude
more than afﬁliate programs run by merchants themselves, such
as the Amazon Associates Program. Lower attempted fraud cou-
pled with the much higher use of evasive cookie-stufﬁng techniques
against in-house afﬁliate programs suggests that such programs en-
joy stricter policing, thereby making them difﬁcult targets of fraud.
We also ﬁnd that retailers in the Apparel, Department Stores, and
Travel and Hotels sectors of e-commerce are disproportionately tar-
geted by afﬁliate fraud, usually through domains typosquatted on
the merchant’s trademarks. Finally, we evaluate data from a two-
month in situ user study with 70+ users and ﬁnd that afﬁliate mar-
keting is dominated by a small number of afﬁliates while cookie-
stufﬁng fraud is rarely encountered. Overall, our targeted crawl and
user study both suggest that the problem, while real, appears to be
less prevalent than suggested by previous reports.

2. BACKGROUND
Online merchants beneﬁt from afﬁliate marketing through cus-
tomized and targeted advertising for their products. For example,
when an afﬁliate reviews a bicycle on a blog dedicated to biking,
the bicycle merchant can receive sales from the readers of the blog
without the merchant having to produce an advertising creative or
directly advertise to the blog subscribers.
Instead, the merchant
pays a commission to the afﬁliate for each such sale made.

Figure 1: Different actors and revenue ﬂow in the afﬁliate marketing ecosystem. The left half of the ﬁgure depicts a potential customer
receiving an afﬁliate cookie, while the right half shows the use of the afﬁliate cookie to determine payout upon a successful transaction.
To recruit afﬁliates for advertising goods and services, an online
merchant can either run its own afﬁliate program or join one run by
a larger afﬁliate network. While some merchants like Amazon and
HostGator run their own afﬁliate programs, most online retailers
(particularly those whose expertise is on the brick-and-mortar side
of the business) market through large afﬁliate networks such as CJ
Afﬁliate and Rakuten LinkShare. Figure 1 provides an overview
of the afﬁliate marketing ecosystem where a merchant is part of a
large afﬁliate network that acts as a link between afﬁliates, who are
typically content publishers, and merchants.
Afﬁliates who sign up for an afﬁliate network can choose to mar-
ket for one or more merchants who are members of the network.
Afﬁliate networks generally assign unique identiﬁers to all afﬁliates
(afﬁliate IDs) and merchants (merchant IDs). Upon signup, afﬁli-
ates receive special links from the afﬁliate network that encode the
identiﬁers for the afﬁliate and the merchant for whom the afﬁliate
is advertising. An afﬁliate includes these afﬁliate links in published
content (e.g., a product review site) such that, when a potential
buyer visits an afﬁliate’s Web site and clicks on the link, it redi-
rects the visitor to the merchant site via the afﬁliate program. The
afﬁliate link GET request to the afﬁliate program returns an HTTP
cookie (i.e., an afﬁliate cookie) that associates the user’s visit with
the corresponding afﬁliate. These cookies uniquely identify the re-
ferring afﬁliate for up to a month after the initial visit. If the user
visits the merchant site during this period and completes a transac-
tion, the afﬁliate network can identify the referral using the afﬁliate
program’s tracking pixel on the merchant’s site. The referring af-
ﬁliate usually earns between 4 and 10% on a completed transaction
as a commission from the afﬁliate network who, in turn, is paid by
the merchant for sourcing the sale.1 In-house programs work simi-
larly, with the network replaced by infrastructure maintained by the
merchant itself.
Afﬁliate cookies remain in a user’s browser until they expire,
are overwritten by a different afﬁliate’s cookie, or the user deletes
them manually.
If a user clicks on links for the same merchant
from multiple afﬁliates in the same afﬁliate program, the cookie
is overwritten and only the last afﬁliate to refer the user earns a
commission.
These behaviors — that the presence of a cookie determines pay-

allowed duration for conversion and the implementation details (in-
cluding the afﬁliate URL and cookie structures) can vary consider-
ably among afﬁliate programs.
out and that the most recent cookie “wins” — are at the core of the
cookie-stufﬁng technique that allows fraudulent afﬁliates to obtain
illicit commissions. In Figure 1, instead of using the afﬁliate URL
as a clickable link, a fraudulent afﬁliate may cause the browser to
directly fetch her afﬁliate URL on a page controlled by her without
any explicit clicks from the user, thereby tricking the afﬁliate pro-
gram into returning a cookie that then identiﬁes the fraudulent afﬁl-
iate as the referrer for the user’s transactions. As a result, not only
does an afﬁliate program pay a non-advertising afﬁliate, but the
fraudulent cookie overwrites any existing afﬁliate cookie that may
have already been present, thereby potentially stealing the commis-
sion from a legitimate afﬁliate. Furthermore, cookie-stufﬁng fraud
is typically completely opaque to an end user and goes against the
advertising guidelines issued by the Federal Trade Commission for
marketers, which require declaration of any ﬁnancial relationship
with advertisers [9]. As a result, most afﬁliate programs explicitly
forbid cookie-stufﬁng. For instance, the HostGator afﬁliate pro-
gram states that “sales made through cookie stufﬁng methods will
be considered invalid” [10].
In prior work, Moore et al. found several typosquatted domains
that belong to fraudulent afﬁliate marketers [13]. Kapravelos et
al. also found popular browser extensions that were cookie-stufﬁng
major afﬁliate networks like the Amazon Associates Program [11].
Snyder et al. studied the extent to which users encountered afﬁli-
ate fraud from the HTTP request logs for a public university [16].
In another study, Edelman et al. explored the incentives of different
players in the afﬁliate marketing ecosystem, and also used crawling
to identify afﬁliate programs defrauded through adware, typosquat-
ting, and search engine optimization (SEO) [7]. Our work furthers
this line of work by characterizing cookie-stufﬁng techniques and
the range of targeted networks and retailers. In addition, we per-
form a user study to characterize the prevalence of afﬁliate market-
ing and cookie-stufﬁng fraud.
3. METHODOLOGY
In this section we describe how we measure cookie-stufﬁng fraud
against six large afﬁliate programs: CJ Afﬁliate, Rakuten LinkShare,
ShareASale, ClickBank, Amazon Associates Program, and Host-
Gator Afﬁliate Program. While Amazon and HostGator run their
own afﬁliate programs, the remaining four are consistently top-
rated afﬁliate networks [15], which include well known merchants
such as Nordstrom, Lego Brand, GoDaddy, etc. First, we study the
structures of afﬁliate URLs and cookies used by these programs
42so that we can identify the afﬁliate network, the targeted merchant,
and the afﬁliate’s ID. We then use a custom-built browser extension
to identify afﬁliate cookies received while browsing, and use it for
the large scale crawling and the user study.
3.1 Identifying Afﬁliate URLs and Cookies
Broadly, we identiﬁed afﬁliate URLs and cookies either by sign-
ing up for these programs ourselves, or by ﬁnding this information
online. Table 1 shows how we parse out afﬁliate and merchant IDs
from some example afﬁliate URLs and cookies. For CJ Afﬁliate,
we only show how we identify the publisher ID because we are
unable to identify the corresponding afﬁliate ID. Every CJ afﬁliate
can have multiple publisher IDs, one for each site used for pub-
lishing afﬁliate marketing creatives. However, every publisher ID
is uniquely associated with a single afﬁliate. As a result, we use
the terms publisher ID and afﬁliate ID interchangeably when dis-
cussing CJ Afﬁliate in the following sections.
Finally, the merchant is easy to identify because an afﬁliate URL
eventually redirects to the merchant domain.
3.2 User Study
In our user study, we examine how often users click on afﬁl-
iate links while browsing the Web, and identify afﬁliate cookies
using a custom-built browser extension for Google Chrome called
AffTracker.2
AffTracker gathers information about every single afﬁliate cookie
it observes in the Set-Cookie HTTP response headers while a
user is browsing. Upon detection of an afﬁliate cookie, AffTracker
parses out the afﬁliate and merchant identiﬁers and the rendering
information, including size and visibility, for the DOM element that
initiated the afﬁliate URL request. AffTracker also records the redi-
rect chain for the requests that result in afﬁliate cookies. Besides
notifying the user about the cookie, AffTracker also submits this
information to our server which stores it in a Postgres database.
By advertising to friends and colleagues, we obtained browsing
data from 74 installations between March 1, 2015 – May 2, 2015.
Using a locally generated unique ID, we can attribute afﬁliate cook-
ies to speciﬁc users without collecting any personally identiﬁable
information (PII).
While we can identify ﬁnal attributes of DOM elements that
cause a browser to fetch the afﬁliate links, we cannot automatically
determine how such DOM elements are generated. Upon manual
inspection we came across several afﬁliates who use JavaScript or
Flash to dynamically generate hidden images and iframes that then
request afﬁliate URLs. However, we are unable to quantify this
phenomenon. Also, our user study does not have a completely ran-
dom sample of users, and is likely biased towards savvy computer
users. We discuss the results of our user study in Section 4.3.
3.3 Crawling
To characterize cookie-stufﬁng at scale, we visited over 475K
domains to search for stuffed cookies. As described in Section 2,
