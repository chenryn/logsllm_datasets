    What steps will reproduce the problem?
    1. Download test case
    2. extract test case
    3. cd unmarshal_testcase && make && ./unmarshal_testcase
    Expected: 9th and 16th item to be parsed like the others
    Instead: the 9th and 17th item are empty strings
    It doesn't appear to to effect further items? at least up to 24.
