### Ethics Considerations
- **Data Collection**: We collected publicly available data from our honeypot pages' likers, including friend lists and page likes.
- **Privacy Protection**: All data were encrypted at rest and not re-distributed. No personal information was extracted; only aggregated statistics were analyzed.
- **Ethical Concerns**: Paying farms to generate fake likes raises ethical concerns, but this was necessary to create the honeypots and observe like farm behavior. The study aims to understand and counter these activities.
- **Financial Impact**: Each farm received a small amount ($190 at most). The research was reviewed and approved by the NICTA legal team.
