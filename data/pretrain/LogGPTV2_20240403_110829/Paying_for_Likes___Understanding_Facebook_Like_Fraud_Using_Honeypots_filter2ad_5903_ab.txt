likes even though we were charged in advance. We tried to reach the
like farm admins several times but received no response. Overall,
we collected a total of 6,292 likes (4,523 from like farms and 1,769
from Facebook ads). The largest number of likes were garnered by
AL-USA, the lowest (excluding inactive campaigns) by FB-USA.
Ethics Considerations. Although we only collected openly avail-
able data, we did collect (public) proﬁle information from our hon-
eypot pages’ likers, e.g., friend lists and page likes. We could not
request consent but enforced a few mechanisms to protect user pri-
vacy: all data were encrypted at rest and not re-distributed, and no
personal information was extracted, i.e., we only analyzed aggre-
gated statistics. We are also aware that paying farms to generate
fake likes might raise ethical concerns, however, this was crucial
to create the honeypots and observe the like farms’ behavior. We
believe that the study will help, in turn, to understand and counter
these activities. Also note that the amount of money each farm re-
ceived was small ($190 at most) and that this research was reviewed
and approved by the NICTA legal team.
4. ANALYSIS
We now compare the characteristics of the likes garnered by the
honeypot pages promoted via legitimate Facebook campaigns and
those obtained via like farms.
4.1 Location and Demographics Analysis
Location. For each campaign, we looked at the distribution of lik-
ers’ countries: as shown in Figure 1, for the ﬁrst four Facebook
Table 2: Gender and age statistics of likers.
campaigns (FB-USA, FB-FRA, FB-IND, FB-EGY), we mainly re-
ceived likes from the targeted country (87–99.8%), even though
FB-USA and FB-FRA generated a number of likes much smaller
than any other campaign. When we targeted Facebook users world-
wide (FB-ALL), we almost exclusively received likes from India
(96%). Looking at the like farms, most likers from SocialFormula
were based in Turkey, regardless of whether we requested a US-
only campaign. The other three farms delivered likes complying
to our requests, e.g., for US-only campaigns, the pages received a
majority of likes from US proﬁles.
Other Demographics. In Table 2, we show the distribution of lik-
ers’ gender and age, and also compare them to the global Facebook
network (last row). The last column reports the KL-divergence be-
tween the age distribution of the campaign users and that of the
entire Facebook population, highlighting large divergence for FB-
IND, FB-EGY, and FB-ALL, which are biased toward younger
users. These three campaigns also appear to be skewed toward male
proﬁles. In contrast, the demographics of likers from SocialFor-
mula and, to a lesser extent, AuhtenticLikes and MammothSocials,
are much more similar to those of the entire network, even though
male users are still over-represented.
4.2 Temporal Analysis
We also analyzed temporal patterns observed for each of the
campaigns. In Figure 2, we plot the cumulative number of likes
observed on each honeypot page over our observation period (15
days). We observe from Figure 2(b) that all the like farm cam-
paigns, except BoostLikes, exhibit a very similar trend with a few
bursts of a large number of likes. Speciﬁcally, for the SocialFor-
mula, AuthenticLikes, and MammothSocials campaigns, likes were
garnered within a short period of time of two hours. With Authen-

ticLikes, we observed likes from more than 700 proﬁles within the
ﬁrst 4 hours of the second day of data collection. Interestingly, no
more likes were observed later on. On the contrary, the BoostLikes
campaign targeting US users shows a different temporal behavior:
the trend is actually comparable to that observed in the Facebook
Ads campaigns (see Figure 2(a)). The number of likes steadily in-
creases during the observation period and no abrupt changes are
observed.
This suggests that two different strategies may be adopted by like
farms. On the one hand, the abrupt increase in the cumulative num-
ber of likes happening during a short period of time might likely be
due to automated scripts operating a set of fake proﬁles. These pro-
ﬁles are instrumented to satisfy the number of likes as per the cus-
tomer’s request. On the other hand, BoostLikes’s strategy, which
resembles the temporal evolution in Facebook campaigns, seems
to rely on the underlying social graph, possibly constituted by fake
proﬁles operated by humans. Results presented in the next section
corroborate the existence of these two strategies.
4.3 Social Graph Analysis
Next, we evaluated the social graph induced by the likers’ pro-
ﬁles. To this end, we associated each user with one of the like farm
services based on the page they liked. Note that a few users liked
pages in multiple campaigns, as we will discuss in Section 4.4. A
signiﬁcant fraction of users actually liked pages corresponding to
both the AuthenticLikes and the MammothSocials campaigns (see
Figure 4): we put these users into a separate group, labelled as
ALMS. Table 3 summarizes the number of likers associated with
each service, as well as additional details about their friendship net-
works. Note that the number of likers reported for each campaign
in Table 3 is different from the number of campaign likes (Table 1),
since some users liked more than one page.
Many likers kept their friend lists private: this occurred for al-
most 80% of likers in the Facebook campaigns, about 75% in the
BoostLikes campaign, and much less frequently for the other like
farm campaigns (∼40–60%). The number and percentage of users
with public friend lists are reported in Table 3. The fourth column
reports the average number of friends (± the standard deviation)
for proﬁles with visible friend lists, and the ﬁfth column reports the
median. Some friendship relations may be hidden, e.g., if a friend
chose to be invisible in friend lists, thus, these numbers only rep-
resent a lower bound. The average number of friends of users as-
sociated with the BoostLikes campaign (and to a smaller extent,
the AuthenticLikes campaign) was much higher than the average
number of friends observed elsewhere.
To evaluate the social ties between likers, we looked at friendship
relations between likers (either originating from the same campaign
provider or not), ignoring friendship relations with Facebook users
