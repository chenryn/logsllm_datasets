virtualized transformation
initiatives start to be
O&M challenge will implemented, IT
not be about infrastructure has
replication, but about: become exponentially
1. Automation more complex.
2. Integration 1. Real-time
3. Reuse monitoring
4. Abstraction 2. Prediction
5. Upgrade optimization
3. Control and
decision making
Trend: 5 big clouds (GAAVI), 100+ industry clouds, 500+ regions, 5000+
edge sites. The average business runs 38% of workloads in public cloud and Trend: digital transformation initiative is expected to growth 20%/year until
41% in private cloud 2025. Intelligent monitoring market is expected to growth b/year until 2025
Cloud Edge Applications Overwhelming number of alarms Ultra-scale and Complexity
and monitoring data,makes it
impossible to know where to focus
during incident resolution.
Not only monitoring
tools are important,
the velocity of code
deployments also
becomes key
