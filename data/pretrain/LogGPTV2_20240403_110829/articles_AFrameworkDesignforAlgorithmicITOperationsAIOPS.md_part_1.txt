Abstract—
AIOps is acronym for Algorithmic IT operations which was coined by Gartner.It represents
automated solutions which consists of machinelearning algorithms and techniques to solve
unknown, critical, complex and hidden IT operationalproblems. It helps tointelligently
classifylog events, predict alerts and standard operating procedures (SOP) and automate
solutions. Since past few years,AIOPS has been growingextremely, manyorganisations and
vendors started exploringAIOps solutions. Gartner recently redefinedAIOps as ―Artificial
Intelligence for IT Operations.‖
AIOps helps to improve IT system service quality and customer satisfaction. It also boost
DevOps productivity and reduce human efforts and operationalcost. In this technical research
work, wefirst summarize what is AIOps, its components, use cases, need of AIOps platform
and real-world challenges.We then propose a framework designforAIOps platform based on
our earlier research work andoutcomes. AIOps is still evolving which need continuous
learning and improvement through scientificresearchand experiment work.
Keywords -AIOps, DevOps, Machine Learning,LogOperations.

[1] INTRODUCTION
I. WHAT ISAIOPS?
AIOps refers IT domain which manages and processesvarioussystem data of their IT
environments using different resources and machine learning (ML) / artificial
intelligence(AI) algorithms.As shown in Figure1, AIOps combines big data and machine
learning techniques to automate complex IT operations which includes classification,

prediction, event correlation and anomaly detection.It is a continuous process of monitoring,
learning, managing alerts / incidents and automating implementation of solutions. AIOps
collects and processes historical as well as real time data which contains system logs, events,
alerts and metrics. Most oforganisations defines AIOps as per their understanding and
requirements.
As per Gartner definition ―AIOpsis a platforms which utilizes big data, machine learning
algorithms to enhance IT operations (like system monitoring, and solution automation) with
proactive approach, and more dynamic insight. AIOps platforms can enable parallel use of
multiple data sources and data gathering methods, analytics ( historical and real-time) and
presentations.‖ [1]

II. COMPONENTS OF AIOPS
 Data Input Sources - There are various data sources like monitoring events, metrics,
incidents, logs etc.
 Real Time Data Processing - Systems which accesses and pre-processes input data
from data sources in real-time.
 Rules and Patterns Mining - Systems which can detect find patterns from the pre-
processed data to uncover hidden patterns, association and abnormalities.
 Domain Algorithms - Algorithms which allow domain based system to react
automatically on detectedabnormalities and variations from normal behaviour and it’s causes.
 Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence - It improves decision-making ability using
Machine learning or Artificial Intelligence algorithms and techniques.
 Automation - It uses Machine learning or Artificial Intelligence algorithms results to
automate standard operating procedures (SOP) to reduce DevOps workloads and improves
systems availability and performance.

III. USE CASES OF AIOPS
 Predictionof outages and failures - Analysis and prediction of warnings/alerts and
outages based on supervised learnings using ML algorithms allow admins to take
proactive actions to prevent it.
 Event Correlation - To troubleshoot system problems, it is critical to understand
correlations between events.
 Anomaly Detection- Dynamic thresholds allow AIOps to determine what is a normal
and abnormal activities.
 Root Cause Analysis(RCA) - Determining cause of problem by tracing it to root by
using event correlation and log analysis to fix. It reduce Mean Time To Detect(MTTD) and
Mean Time to Repair (MTTR).
 Alarm Management- AIOps identify false alerts and givesonly legit alerts in case of
anomaly detection.
 Intelligent Remediation- AIOps automate standard operating procedures (SOP) action
to resolve problems.
IV. WHY AIOPS?
IT industry has been evolved from desktop products to online services or applications. The
way these services has been built and released are different from traditional desktop products,
which brings up the complexity and importance of operational efficacy for online application
services. Today’s applications are complex and critical.Cloud computing has increased more
complexity in application architecture and deployments. DevOps is a processof continuous
development , integration and deployment of application services. In software industry Agile
methodology and DevOps culture has been widely adopted in almost every organisation. Due
to evolution and implementation of cloud computing, microservices, serverlesstechnologies
the scale and complexity of application services have increased drastically.Any mistake in
this continuous process from designing architecture to deploying codebase and monitoring
application can degrade system performance and impact on customer experience. It can also
result in interruption of services which cost to business. To address these DevOps IT
operation challenges using AI, the term AIOps came out from Gartner [2]. Generally, AIOps
can help empowering software applications, engineers and DevOps to efficiently and
effectively build and operate application services that are easy to support and maintain by
using artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. The outcome of AIOpsis
significant, ensuring high availability of services, maintaining quality of services and
customer satisfaction, boosting productivity of engineers and DevOps, and reducing
operational cost. Below are some major reasons for AIOPS platform:
A. Data volumes are large and disparate
In this decade, we have seen data explosion. There are various sources of data generation due
to digital devices, mobiles, IoT devices, Cloud computing etc. The velocity and volume of
data is countless. This big data management is nightmare for DevOps and administrators.
Building and processing ML models are time and resource consuming process, which
ultimately cost to business.
B. Manual Troubleshooting
[2039]
Design Engineering ISSN: 0011-9342 | Year 2021
Issue: 5 | Pages: 2037 - 2044
In IT operations, keeping system up and running is top most priority. If there are any
interruptions or degradation to services, it creates all hands on deck situation for DevOps
team. Manually troubleshooting any system through logs, events and alerts is like searching
needle in haystack. It definitely increase mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to
repair (MTTR) of business application which may causes long system downtime. Any system
degradation or downtime may lead to business loss and ultimately lose customer trust.
C. Emerging Tools / Technologies
There are plenty of tools and technologies are emerging on daily or weekly basis due to
adaptation of agile and DevOps methodology, software / tools are getting build and deploy
very quickly. Also microservices, serverless, cloud computing, big data and machine learning
technologies adding more complexity towards IT operations. To cope up with these emerging
tools and technologies is almost impossible for humankind.
D. Bombardment of Alarms
As there is explosion of data and technologies, it generates tons of logs, events, alerts and
alarms. Most of times, they are non-critical and false because of mis-configurations. Single
issue can create many events and alerts , which confuses and overload monitoring systems.
To handle these bombardment of logs and alarms is almost impossible for DevOps and admin
teams without Machine Learning techniques.
