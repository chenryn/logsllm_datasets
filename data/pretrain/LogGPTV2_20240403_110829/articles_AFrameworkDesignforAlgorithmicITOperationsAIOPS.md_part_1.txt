**Abstract:**
AIOps, an acronym for Algorithmic IT Operations, was coined by Gartner to represent automated solutions that use machine learning algorithms and techniques to address complex, critical, and hidden IT operational problems. AIOps helps in intelligently classifying log events, predicting alerts, and automating standard operating procedures (SOPs). Over the past few years, AIOps has gained significant traction, with many organizations and vendors exploring its potential. Gartner recently redefined AIOps as "Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations."

AIOps enhances IT system service quality and customer satisfaction, boosts DevOps productivity, and reduces human effort and operational costs. This research work summarizes AIOps, its components, use cases, the need for an AIOps platform, and real-world challenges. We then propose a framework design for an AIOps platform based on our earlier research and outcomes. AIOps is still evolving and requires continuous learning and improvement through scientific research and experimentation.

**Keywords:** AIOps, DevOps, Machine Learning, Log Operations

### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 What is AIOps?

AIOps refers to the IT domain that manages and processes various system data from IT environments using different resources and machine learning (ML) / artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. As shown in Figure 1, AIOps combines big data and machine learning techniques to automate complex IT operations, including classification, prediction, event correlation, and anomaly detection. It is a continuous process of monitoring, learning, managing alerts/incidents, and automating the implementation of solutions. AIOps collects and processes both historical and real-time data, such as system logs, events, alerts, and metrics. Organizations define AIOps according to their specific needs and understanding.

According to Gartner, "AIOps is a platform that utilizes big data and machine learning algorithms to enhance IT operations (like system monitoring and solution automation) with a proactive approach and more dynamic insights. AIOps platforms can enable the parallel use of multiple data sources and data gathering methods, analytics (historical and real-time), and presentations." [1]

AIOps bridges different IT operations, including:
- IT Service Management
- Automation
- Monitoring

#### 1.2 Components of AIOps

- **Data Input Sources:** Various data sources include monitoring events, metrics, incidents, and logs.
- **Real-Time Data Processing:** Systems that access and preprocess input data from data sources in real time.
- **Rules and Patterns Mining:** Systems that detect patterns from preprocessed data to uncover hidden patterns, associations, and abnormalities.
- **Domain Algorithms:** Algorithms that allow domain-based systems to react automatically to detected abnormalities and variations from normal behavior.
- **Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence:** Improves decision-making ability using ML or AI algorithms and techniques.
- **Automation:** Uses ML or AI algorithm results to automate standard operating procedures (SOPs), reducing DevOps workloads and improving system availability and performance.

#### 1.3 Use Cases of AIOps

- **Prediction of Outages and Failures:** Analysis and prediction of warnings/alerts and outages using supervised learning with ML algorithms allow admins to take proactive actions.
- **Event Correlation:** Understanding correlations between events is critical for troubleshooting system problems.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Dynamic thresholds help AIOps determine what is normal and abnormal activity.
- **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** Determines the cause of a problem by tracing it to the root using event correlation and log analysis, reducing Mean Time To Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR).
- **Alarm Management:** AIOps identifies false alerts and provides only legitimate alerts in case of anomaly detection.
- **Intelligent Remediation:** AIOps automates SOP actions to resolve problems.

#### 1.4 Why AIOps?

The IT industry has evolved from desktop products to online services or applications. The way these services are built and released differs from traditional desktop products, increasing the complexity and importance of operational efficiency for online application services. Today's applications are complex and critical, and cloud computing has further increased the complexity of application architecture and deployments. DevOps, which involves continuous development, integration, and deployment of application services, is widely adopted in the software industry, along with Agile methodologies.

Due to the evolution and implementation of cloud computing, microservices, and serverless technologies, the scale and complexity of application services have increased drastically. Any mistake in this continuous process, from designing architecture to deploying code and monitoring applications, can degrade system performance and impact customer experience. It can also result in service interruptions, which can be costly to businesses. To address these DevOps IT operation challenges using AI, the term AIOps was introduced by Gartner [2]. AIOps empowers software applications, engineers, and DevOps to efficiently and effectively build and operate application services that are easy to support and maintain using AI and ML techniques. The outcome of AIOps is significant, ensuring high service availability, maintaining service quality and customer satisfaction, boosting engineer and DevOps productivity, and reducing operational costs.

**Major Reasons for AIOps Platform:**

- **Large and Disparate Data Volumes:** In recent years, there has been a data explosion due to digital devices, mobiles, IoT devices, and cloud computing. Managing this big data is a challenge for DevOps and administrators, as building and processing ML models is time-consuming and resource-intensive.
- **Manual Troubleshooting:** Keeping systems up and running is a top priority in IT operations. Manual troubleshooting through logs, events, and alerts is like searching for a needle in a haystack, increasing MTTD and MTTR, leading to longer system downtime and potential business loss.
- **Emerging Tools/Technologies:** The rapid emergence of new tools and technologies due to the adoption of Agile and DevOps methodologies adds complexity to IT operations. Microservices, serverless, cloud computing, big data, and ML technologies make it almost impossible for humans to keep up.
- **Bombardment of Alarms:** The explosion of data and technologies generates a large number of logs, events, alerts, and alarms, many of which are non-critical and false due to misconfigurations. Handling this volume of data without ML techniques is nearly impossible for DevOps and admin teams.
