Assistant: The most common Git-based code version control system is Github, which provides the creation and management of code warehouses, as well as code check-in and check-out operations. Create a code warehouse: - Open the Github website, log in to the account and enter the "Repositories" page; - Click the "New" button, enter the name and description of the warehouse; - Select the type of warehouse, which can be public or private; - Click "Create repository" ‚Äù button, the creation is complete. Manage code warehouse: - After entering the warehouse page, you can perform various operations on the code warehouse, such as uploading code, modifying code, deleting code, merging code, etc. Check in the code: - Open the folder where the local code is located, and use the Git command line tool to enter the following command: git add . (. means all files); - Then enter the submitted code information: git commit -m "commit information"; - Finally push the code to Github: git push origin master. Check out the code: - Open the Github website and enter the required code warehouse page; - Click the "Clone or download" button at the top right of the page to obtain the remote address of the code warehouse; - Use the Git command line tool locally to enter the following command: git clone warehouse address; - After success, you can find the code of the code warehouse in the local folder.
