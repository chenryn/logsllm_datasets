**Describe the current behavior**  
logging from the python's standard library stopped working in TF 1.14. Log
file is not created and the output supposed to be written there is instead
redirected to the stdout, which results in each logging message appear twice
in the console.
**Describe the expected behavior**  
When run on TF 1.12 , log.txt is created and the logging is being recorded
correctly.
**Code to reproduce the issue**
    import logging
    import tensorflow as tf
    def main(_):
        FORMAT = '%(asctime)-15s %(message)s'
        logging.basicConfig(filename='log.txt', filemode='w',
                            datefmt='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S',
                            level=logging.INFO, format=FORMAT)
        console = logging.StreamHandler()
        console.setLevel(logging.INFO)
        logging.getLogger('').addHandler(console)
        sess = tf.Session()
        logging.info("test write")
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        tf.app.run()
This yields the following output:
    2019-06-16 17:54:24.047410: I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:1326] Created TensorFlow device (/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:GPU:0 with 10711 MB memory) -> physical GPU (device: 0, name: TITAN X (Pascal), pci bus id: 0000:04:00.0, compute capability: 6.1)
    I0616 17:54:24.051054 140454010144128 test_logging.py:15] test write
    test write
Notice that `test write` appears twice in the output. And log.txt is not
created. When run with TF 1.12 this code snippets behaves as expected.
