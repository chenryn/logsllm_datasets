INTRODUCTION
Chances are your IT organization has made large investments in infrastructure and applications that have
been running your business for years. Maintaining this infrastructure costs a lot of money, perhaps up to
80% of an IT budget.
If you are like many of your peers, in addition to maintaining your IT infrastructure within budget, you are
also trying to improve it by working on:
• New applications
• Modernization efforts to upgrade applications
• DevOps implementations
• Migrating off expensive traditional databases
• Implementing flexible Cloud-based environments
• Providing low cost SaaS applications to consumers
• Establishing open source software standards
Maintaining and improving your IT infrastructure at the same time, is increasingly becoming more difficult
under the pressures of fast paced technology advances and slow paced budget increases.
Worse, some leading database vendors have strategies designed to lock you in to contracts that
increase your costs annually, consuming more and more of your budget. Keeping your IT lights on
leaves little money left for new investments into new kinds of integrated, smart, and mobile applications
that positively transform customer experiences for your organization. Organizations that cannot invest

in these new application initiatives will find their position in the marketplace and with their customers
changing dramatically in the years to come.
While line-of-business managers and marketing executives see all kinds of opportunity to improve
the performance of the business and please their customers, they are all too often disappointed by IT
organizations that cannot get to their needs because of squeezed budgets.
As a result, organizations are increasingly turning to a database platform that is less expensive but just as
capable as their traditional database to free up money – EDB Postgres from EnterpriseDB® (EDB™).
EDB Postgres provides the performance, security, manageability features, and capabilities required
to power the vast majority of enterprise workloads. This reduces spending on expensive traditional
databases so that budget can be redirected to new mobile, analytics, web, cloud, social, or Internet of
Things (IoT) applications that contribute to customer-centric digital transformation initiatives.

The potential for EDB Postgres to free up budget in core IT is especially true for organizations using
Oracle. In addition to its core PostgreSQL feature set and enhanced features, EDB Postgres includes
compatibility with Oracle. Compatibility with Oracle allows EDB Postgres to be used in place of what is,

for many enterprises, the most expensive component in their software stack for operational and mission-
critical applications.
EDB Postgres’ compatibility allows it:
• To be used in place of Oracle for new applications
• To replace Oracle for old applications due for modernization
• To migrate applications off of Oracle
• To complement and coexist with existing Oracle infrastructure
• To leverage existing Oracle developer and DBA skills
Finally, while you may change your database technology to EDB Postgres, your organization’s most
valuable technical assets, its business logic, is preserved and does not have to be re-written. EDB
Postgres natively understands and processes your existing Oracle PL/SQL programs and data without
any translation layers and without long, problematic consulting engagements. This true compatibility
means your expectations for performance are preserved, your intellectual capital is protected, and your
staff can continue using its existing skill set.

ADAPTING TO A CHANGING
WORLD
The pace of technology change in general around the volume, variety, uses, and management of
data in particular pose significant challenges and changes to organizations of all sizes. The change
is so pervasive and deep that it is predicted that 75% of the companies in the S&P 500 will change
by 20281. This change is also transforming the database market. One important change is that open-
source relational DBMSs have matured significantly and can be used to replace commercial Relational
Database Management Systems (RDBMSs) at a considerable TCO saving. Information leaders, Database
Administrators (DBAs) and application development managers can now consider them as a standard
choice for deploying applications.2

Amid all this change, some things haven’t changed – specifically the relentless rising costs of using
Oracle. Not surprisingly, higher costs are helping accelerate the move to open source, as is another
less publicized statistic: 92% of customers say Oracle does not clearly communicate licensing
changes.3 Complex licenses and more aggressive audit practices have prompted many Oracle
customers to seek alternatives.

THE EDB POSTGRES
PLATFORM MAKES IT
POSSIBLE
Organizations are increasingly choosing EDB Postgres Enterprise as a standard RDBMS for new and
existing applications. EDB Postgres Enterprise provides the performance, security, manageability,
and DBA/Developer features required to power enterprise workloads. EDB’s low-cost, open source-
based development model and subscription pricing lowers consumption costs, allowing you to free up
expensive proprietary database dollars that can be redirected to new applications of innovation. Instead
of struggling with the burden of excessive database costs that leaves little budget to pay for the rising
demand for new database applications, you can actually reduce your core database costs and redirect
the savings to innovation initiatives.
Further, EDB Postgres is a fully integrated, enterprise-class data management platform that provides the
software, services, and support that organizations are accustomed to receiving from their traditional,
expensive vendors: enterprise performance and capabilities and tools, enterprise support and services,
flexible deployment options, software lifecycle control, a reliable roadmap, and a worldwide ecosystem of
commercial partners.

While access to and use of an open source database may be free, experienced managers understand
that to deploy any software at scale, quickly, securely, and competently requires spending money with
a commercial partner that can provide a comprehensive platform to service, support, and grow with the
software now and in the future.
The failure to secure a commercial partner for open source software with an incentive for your long-term
success will inevitably cost the organization in other ways in the form of:
• Technically inferior solutions
• Overly complex integrations
• Delayed deployments
• Increased downtime
• Longer maintenance cycles
• Steeper learning curves
• Ongoing reliance on consultants
Without a commercial grade platform backed up by a professional products company, your organization’s
use of open source-based software will be tactical at best and unable to deliver the strategic benefits you
are seeking.
EDB Postgres provides you with an open source-based commercial grade platform comparable to
what you have come to depend on and expect from your current database vendor but at a significantly
reduced cost.

EDB BUSINESS PRACTICES
MAKE YOU PROFITABLE
Nobody wants to jump from the frying pan into the fire. While changing or acquiring a new database
vendor is no trivial task, this paper is designed to demonstrate the distinct business advantages of doing
less business with Oracle and more with open source-based EDB.
EDB’s goals as a business partner have always been focused on a fair exchange of value with our
customers and a transparent win-win strategy in conducting business. We are able to offer dramatically
lower prices because of the open source development model behind our products that reduces our
costs. We pass these savings on to you, our customers, and do not rely on contentious licensing policies
to lock in customers and drive up costs.
We also strive to be recognized as a trusted partner by our customers and to be a company that is easy
to do business with. We achieve the latter by offering policies such as uniCore (universal core) pricing,
and a comprehensive platform with bundled tools, support, and maintenance at no extra cost.

BUSINESS MODEL
COMPARISON
EDB has a substantially different business model than Oracle. EDB provides a simple-to-understand price,
and a subscription model for software consumption. There are no built-in cost accelerators, no hidden
fees, no unbundling of features or components for additional costs, and no penalties that can result in
large surprise cost increases.
EDB’s basic business transaction is the purchase of an all-inclusive subscription that includes all database
features, all tools, all deployment environments and all maintenance costs.
In addition, the subscription model does not require a large upfront perpetual license fee that is accounted
for as a CapEx cost. This is often beneficial to customer budgets for new purchases and reduces liabilities
on the balance sheet for old purchases. All subscription costs qualify for OpEx accounting.
Because EDB’s subscriptions are paid as an annual OpEx expense that may be discontinued without
penalty, they are often looked upon as a simple maintenance cost.
In contrast, Oracle requires a large capital expenditure up front in the form of a perpetual license fee
that requires a significant commitment from your organization before having much experience with the
software or with Oracle as a vendor. Then, starting in your first year, you pay an annual maintenance fee
priced at 22% of the license fee. Moreover, the annual maintenance fee often automatically increases 3%
every year – a budgeting fact often overlooked by Oracle customers.
