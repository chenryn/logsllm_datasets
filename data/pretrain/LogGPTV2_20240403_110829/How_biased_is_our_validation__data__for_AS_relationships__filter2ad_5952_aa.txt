ABSTRACT
The business relationships between Autonomous Systems (ASes)
can provide fundamental insights into the Internet’s routing ecosys-
tem. Throughout the last two decades, many works focused on how
to improve the inference of those relationships. Yet, it has proven
difficult to assemble extensive ground-truth data sets for valida-
tion. Therefore, more recent works rely entirely on relationships
extracted from BGP communities to serve as "best-effort" ground-
truth. In this paper, we highlight the shortcomings of this trend. We
show that the best-effort validation data does not cover relation-
ships between ASes within the Latin American (LACNIC) service
region even though ~14% of all inferred relationships are from that
region. We further show that the overall precision of 96-98 % for
peering relationships achieved by three of the most prominent
algorithms can drop by 14-25 % when considering only peering
relationships between Tier-1 and other transit providers. Finally,
we discuss potential ways to overcome the presented challenges in
the future.

1 INTRODUCTION
The Internet consists of many autonomous systems (ASes) that
exchange reachability information (also known as routes). Which
routes are made available to a neighbor often depends on business
relationships. While actual business relationships are rather com-
plex [25, 26], we often categorize them into three different types:
(i) provider-to-customer (P2C), (ii) settlement-free peering partners
(P2P), and (iii) relationships between ASes that belong to the same
organization called sibling-to-sibling (S2S).
Many researchers rely on accurate relationship information for
(i) simulations of routing incidents [48, 49, 59], (ii) IP-to-AS map-
ping [32, 46], or (iii) network (resource) management [40, 62]. Yet,
there is no organisation or entity that can provide authoritative
knowledge for those relationships. Over the last two decades, this
lead to a large corpus of research focusing on inferring relationships
from, e.g., routing information [22, 24, 26, 27, 36, 38, 43].
Yet, there are two major problems that those inferences suffer
from: (i) limited visibility into the Internet’s AS interconnection
graph and (ii) lack of ground-truth validation data. The visibil-
ity problem is a well-known challenge in Internet topology re-
search [3, 16, 29, 52]. While various partial solutions have been
proposed (e.g., using data plane information [7, 18, 21], routing
policy databases [9], or BGP community encodings at IXP route
servers [28]), it is still a challenge to generate a comprehensive
AS-level typology that also captures, e.g., private network intercon-
nections [64].
The lack of ground-truth validation data has been pointed
out as a challenge many times (e.g.,
[24, 43, 60]), yet recently
proposed and evaluated algorithms (see, [36, 38]) rely entirely on
"best-effort" validation data compiled from BGP communities—a
technique initially introduced and used (among others) by Luckie
et al. [43].
To better understand the implications of this trend, this paper fo-
cuses on the basic question: How good is our "best-effort" validation
(data)? In particular, our work makes the following contributions
towards answering this question:
• Bias Analysis. We analyze to which degree the geograph-
ical and topological biases within the sets of inferred and
validated relationships match (§5). We uncover significant
mismatches: While the "best-effort" validation data covers
31 % of all links between ASes in the ARIN region, it only
covers less than 1 % of links in the LACNIC region. Yet, both
regions contain roughly 15% of the inferred relationships.
• Implication analysis. We analyze how such bias mismatches
may affect classification correctness for three (ASRank [43],
ProbLink [36], and TopoScope [38]) classification algorithms1
and uncover substantial drops in precision for certain groups
of peering links (§6). In particular, we observe that the near-
perfect precision of 96-98 % for the entire validation data set
drops by 14-25 % (depending on the algorithm) for peering
relationships between Tier-1 and transit providers.
• Future outlook: We discuss, in-depth, different approaches
for compiling less biased and more complete validation data
sets (§7) and highlight (i) the need for active discourse with
operators and (ii) how the routing ecosystem’s continuous
change can be exploited to over-sample validation data.

2 WHY SHOULD WE CARE ABOUT BIAS?
Biases commonly arise in all forms of classifications—whether one
looks at face detection [11], patient treatment [54], or criminal
behavior [53]. While those disciplines may have stronger social
impacts, the correctness of business relationships may have far-
reaching and unintended consequences when studying the Inter-
net’s routing ecosystem. For instance, Müller et al. [50] recently
proposed an algorithm that relies on the inferred relationships be-
tween Internet Exchange Point (IXP) members to identify spoofed
packets (i.e., packets with a forged source address). The misclas-
sification of a P2C as a P2P relationship could potentially result
in many packets being falsely flagged as spoofed. If an IXP would
publicly disclose, e.g., the number of spoofed packets per member,
the reputation of certain members could sustain damage.
Yet, how did bias affect this example? IXPs are often built with the
intention to keep local traffic local [3], i.e., they connect ASes within
the same geographical region.2 As most geographical regions
have their own operator meetings, conferences, and communities—
e.g., RIPE [57], NANOG [51], or APRICOT [5]—that release different
recommendations on how to operate certain types of networks, the
best practices for routing can differ among regions (and IXPs). For
instance, Marcos et al. [45] recently reported that the usage patterns
for AS path-prepending (a commonly used traffic engineering tech-
nique) vary strongly by region and over time. Similarly, topologi-
cal biases can arise from how ASes of different sizes or locations
within the Internet’s hierarchy select their peering policies [42].
In summary, features such as the geographical or topological
positioning of a network can greatly influence the routing deci-
sions taken by its operators. This may become important when
relationships are explicitly or implicitly3 used in narrow contexts,
e.g., only between members of an IXP. In such a case, the correct-
ness estimates that were obtained from a potentially larger base of
relationships may provide a false sense of safety which may result
in economical consequences (as in the example above).
3 BACKGROUND
In this section, we first give a brief introduction to selected4 relation-
ship inference algorithms, then provide details on previously used
techniques for obtaining validation data, and finally summarize the
already-known sources of bias in validation data.
3.1 Classification Algorithms
Lixin Gao was the first to describe the Internet as a strict hierarchy
in which customers receive transit from the providers "above" them
and redistribute routes according to economically incentives [24].
Based on this hierarchy, she described the notion of a "valley-free"
path—a path that travels strictly upwards, then to at most one AS
of the same height, and then strictly downhill. Using this property,
her proposed algorithm tries to maximize the number of valley-free
paths.
Rather than maximizing the number of valley-free paths, more
recent algorithms often first determine the clique of provider-free
2usually only a small fraction of ASes connect remotely [13].
3e.g., while using bdrmapit—a tool to map IPs to routers and ASes that relies on
relationship inferences—on paths obtained from a limited number of vantage points
4based on significance to our work and recency.
ASes at the "top" of the hierarchy and then iteratively infer rela-
tionships. In 2013, Luckie et al. [43] proposed ASRank—one of the
most-used classifiers till today. ASRank utilizes AS-triplets, a new
metric called "transit-degree", and an extensive list of heuristics
to classify relationships. Giotsas et al. later modified the ASRank
algorithm to adapt it to the IPv6 routing ecosystem [27].
In 2014, Giotsas et al. used routing information, IP paths, and ge-
olocation data to infer two more complex types of AS relationships:
partial-transit and hybrid relationships [26]. If a provider exports
routes towards its customers and peers but not towards its own
providers, then the provider and customer have a partial-transit
relationship. Further, two ASes have a hybrid relationship if their
observed relationships differ throughout various Points of Presence
(PoPs).
In 2019, Jin et al. proposed ProbLink—a meta-classifier that builds
upon an initial classification (e.g., from ASRank) [36]. The algorithm
assigns a probability to each link to be of a certain type based on,
e.g., the relationships of other nearby links, refines the selected
relationship based on the highest probability, and iterates those two
steps until convergence. UNARI [22] takes the idea of probability
one step further and produces a measure of certainty for each link
type as its outcome. TopoScope [38]—as the newest classification
algorithm—applies machine learning techniques on a large set of
link features to perform its classification. Notably, this algorithm
also predicts additional AS links that, despite note being visible,
might exist.
3.2 Validation Data
Compiling a set of ground-truth labels is crucial to properly evaluate
any classification algorithm. Yet, this step has proven to be rather
difficult for AS relationships. Before Luckie et al [43], only the works
by Gao [24] and Dimitropoulos et al. [20] presented validation data
from a Tier-1 and via operator surveys, respectively.
In 2013, Luckie et al. compiled their validation data from (i)
directly reported relationships (e.g., by operators through a web
interface), (ii) relationships extracted from routing policies encoded
in WHOIS databases (more specifically, inside their autnum records)
via the Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL), and (iii) re-
lationships extracted from BGP Community encodings within the
Internet Routing Registry (IRR) databases or public documentation
(e.g., ISPs that host such encoding on their website).
While relying on multiple databases allows for frequent re-
computation of validation data, the sources (ii) and (iii) suffer
from a set of well-known challenges. Most records within the
WHOIS databases are added and maintained voluntarily, hence,
some records get stale (i.e., become inconsistent with publicly visi-
ble routing information) over time [16].
While the same may be true for the publicly documented BGP
community encodings, those, in addition, suffer from ambiguity
problems. Simply put, BGP communities are just colon-separated
value pairs5 [14] that can be tagged onto routes. Which information
is encoded into/decoded from a specific BGP community depends
on the AS that sets/reads it. Ambiguity is introduced when a single
BGP community represents different meanings to (potentially over-
lapping) sets of ASes, e.g., while the BGP community 3356:666
5or triplets, see large BGP communities [31].

could be recognized as an attempt to blackhole a route [39], AS 3356
(Level3/CenturyLink/Lumen) uses it to tag peering routes [56].
Despite those challenges, the data compiled by Luckie et al.
presents the first extensive source of validation information. Recent
classification efforts rely solely on re-computations of their third
data source—relationships from BGP communities [22, 36, 38].
3.3 Existing Insights into Validation Bias
Hard-to-Infer Links. Jin et al. [36] reported on sets of links for
which it is challenging to infer them correctly. They describe those
"hard" links as links with at least one of the following characteristics:
(i) node-degree < 100, (ii) observed by 50 − 100 vantage points, (iii)
neither incident to a vantage point nor a clique AS, (iv) stub links
for which there is no triplet containing two consecutive clique ASes,
and (v) links for which a simple top-down classification results in a
conflict. They further showed that even sophisticated algorithms
like ASRank wrongly infer many of the relationships for hard links
and that the validation data set is skewed towards links for which
it is easy to infer them correctly.
Clique & Vantage Point Links. Luckie et al. [43] show that
for their 2014 validation data set links incident to a clique AS are
over-represented while links between stubs and non-clique ASes
are under-represented. They also note that this disparity is mostly
due to the significant biased introduced by the community-based
data set—the validation data that has been used for the more recent
validations. Similarly, they report that the community-based data
set over-represents links incident to a vantage point over those
only remotely visible.
Complex Relationships. As discussed in §3.1, AS relationships
can differ based on the PoP the link is observed at. Giotsas et al. [26]
reported that their improved algorithm exposed around 1k relation-
ships as hybrid and around 3k relationships as partial-transit. As
the inference of such relationships can be ambiguous, they should
be handled separately during the validation process.
4 OBTAINING & CLEANING DATA
In this section, we first describe how we obtain validation and infer-
ence data (§4.1). Afterward, we take a closer look at the validation
labels and identify entries that either need to be removed or handled
carefully (§4.2).
4.1 Obtaining Validation Data & Inferences
Validation Data. While ASRank’s validation data from April 2013
is publicly available at [12], ProbLink and TopoScope do not contain
validation data in their public repositories [35, 37]. Upon request, we
received the same validation data for both tools—12 snapshots un-
equally spread between January 2014 and April 2018. Each snapshot
was generated using the community-based relationship extraction
method described by Luckie et al. [43] for their ASRank validation.
Inference Data. The monthly generated inference snapshots
that are publicly available for ASRank, ProbLink, and TopoScope
only overlap throughout 2019. As this period is not covered by any
of our validation snapshots, we requested (and promptly received)
an inference snapshot for April 2018 generated by ProbLink. To pro-
duce comparable results for all three algorithms, we continue using
the inference and validation snapshots for April 2018 throughout
the remainder of the paper (unless explicitly specified otherwise).
Notably, we use the term "inferred links" to refer to all AS links
visible in the ASRank data set for April 2018.
4.2 Label Quality & Treatment
Spurious Labels. When taking a first look at the validation data,
we notice 15 AS relationships formed with AS 23456. This AS is
also known as "AS_TRANS" and is exclusively used to represent
32-bit ASNs for devices that only support 16-bit ASNs; therefore,
AS_TRANS does not represent an actual network and hence can not
have any business relationships. We further find 112 relationships
involving reserved (e.g., for documentation or internal use, see [34])
ASes that should neither be publicly routed nor be used to validate
