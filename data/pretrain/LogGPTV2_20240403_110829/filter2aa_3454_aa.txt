Hi! I’m Brendan
• CTO/DSS, Malice Afterthought
• Law Student: IANAL(Y)
• Anything you hear in this presentation 
isn’t legal advice
• Most of it isn’t even a good idea
• You’ve been warned
Quick Tangent: Weev
• U.S. v. Auernheimer
• “Brief of Meredith Patterson, Brendan 
O'Connor, Sergey Bratus, Gabriella 
Coleman, Peyton Engel, Matthew Green, 
Dan Hirsch, Dan Kaminsky, Samuel Liles, 
Shane MacDougall, Brian Martin, C.\ 
Thomas, and Peiter Zatko as Amici Curiae

• Still, though: IANAL. Yet. (One more year!)
DARPA Cyber Fast 
Track
• CREEPYDOL IS NOT CFT WORK. I 
CANNOT EMPHASIZE THIS ENOUGH: 
DARPA CFT WAS NOT IN THE BUSINESS 
OF HAVING ME CREATE CREEPY THINGS.
• That said, two CFT contracts did let me 
build two of the core systems: Reticle, and 
the visualization system.
• Thanks!
Foreword: Democratizing 
Surveillance

I. Foreword: The Democratization of Surveillance
A. "Security is really the government's area."
1. This was actually said to me by my sister recently, indicating that I'm failing in my 
duty to educate my family.
2. Those of us in this room know that the government isn't very good at securing 
things by means *other* than throwing them in prison for large amounts of time.
3. Nonetheless, the government has a near-monopoly on surveillance.
“Only the Good Guys”
http://www.ﬂickr.com/photos/chberge/3753079527
4. When it doesn't, the perception of the general public is that "only good guys" have access 
to terrifying surveillance technology. This is *our fault* for not correcting this misperception, 
though groups reporting on, e.g., all the BlueCoat boxes they've found in repressive 
governments are certainly helping. Heck, PRISM was leaked, and this is *still* the thing I’m 
hearing: people think “hey, the NSA needs that.”
“Sunlight is the best disinfectant”
http://www.ﬂickr.com/photos/andyz/3857625392
B. "Sunlight is the best disinfectant."
1. A recent study showed that cops wearing sunglass cameras were 88% less likely to 
commit actions resulting in complaints, and 60% less likely to use force; when they did use 
force, those officers wearing lapel cameras were consistent in using the least amount of force 
possible in a situation. This effect was not duplicated in officers refusing to wear the 
cameras.
2. If we can see what's going on---if we can look back at our government---we 
have the opportunity to make sure it works as efficiently and safely as possible. If not, we are 
subject to blackmail, extortion, and threats. (See Aaron Swartz.)
So we need sunlight---but we need it quickly, and where our natural inclination, our natural 
sunlight, is not. Those of you who are weapons buffs may know that this isn’t a photo of the 
sun: it’s a picture of the blast caused by Tsar Bomba, the largest nuclear weapon ever 
detonated.
So I get called a stalker

Wait, wrong stalker. This is an adorable cat, apparently named Stalker. People don’t call me 
an adorable cat.
So I get called a stalker

Much better. As I was saying,
C. Why I do "creepy" work.
1. The only effective way to raise the issue of creeping surveillance and loss of 
privacy is to make clear that *anyone*, not just "the good guys," can use this technology for 
good or for evil.
2. The only way to make it clear is, of course, to release software that does it in a 
nice, user-friendly package.
Extremely Serious Disclaimer
To be clear: I do not endorse using this software, or any software, for criminal purposes. 
We're hackers, not criminals. I want the fact of this software's existence to help shape habits 
and, hopefully, the next generations of mobile devices; perhaps they won't be designed (at 
the protocol level) to leak so much information so widely.
Goal: Passive Wireless
http://www.ﬂickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163911718
II. Goals
A. How much data can be extracted from passive wireless monitoring?
1. More than just from a network trace---remember that when not connected to a 
wireless network, WiFi devices send out lists of their known networks, asking if anyone can 
help them.
2. As soon as a device thinks it's connected to WiFi, all its background sync services 
will kick off again---DropBox, iMessage, all the rest. So we'll immediately know that certain 
services will be in play.
3. Over unencrypted WiFi, all the traffic sent by a device is exposed. Even if we can't 
see both sides of every message, we can learn a lot from what we do see---especially if we 
know how a given protocol operates.
4. How much better could we do if we had not one sensor, but ten? Spread out over 
an area? Now we have geolocation, time and place analysis, etc.
5. If we're tracking over a large area, we don't just want to know traffic and devices: 
we want to know people. Can we take data and ﬁnd people? (I don't want your SSN, I want 
your name.)
Goal: Large-Scale Sensing Without 
Centralized Communications
http://www.ﬂickr.com/photos/christmaswithak/2732857205
B. Can we do large-scale sensing without centralized communications?
1. If we centralize communications, life is simple; everyone phones home---but a 
compromised node gives every attacker the location of the mothership.
2. Centralized communications decrease resistance to attack, and prevent you from 
responding agilely to attack.
Goal: Intelligibility
http://www.slideshare.net/EmilandDC/dear-nsa-let-me-take-care-ou
C. Can we present massive amounts of this data in a way that is intelligible by mortals? 
User-friendly? Still secure?
1. Group One of high security products: incredible technology, terrible UI. This 
causes low adoption, or (possibly worse) mistakes in use. Systems fail, people die. Examples: 
Pidgin-OTR, or PGP/OpenPGP.
2. Group Two: Concerns about technology, great UI. This causes adoption, but can 
cause massive problems later (if the concerns are borne out). Examples: HushMail, Silent 
Circle.
3. Group Three: Good technology, great UI. This is wonderful, but incredibly hard to 
do (because UI masters are usually not security wizards). Example: CryptoCat, RedPhone.
4. We would aspire to have CreepyDOL be in Group Three, through a variety of 
methods to ensure secure communication in relatively-intelligible ways. *This is an ongoing 
process.* Our code is open source, to allow veriﬁcation.
Background: Academic Sensor 
Networks Rock!
http://www.ﬂickr.com/photos/22240293@N05/3912598338
(This is the MIT CS building, if you’re wondering. They have an awesome sensor network, and 
their papers are always accompanied by the *weirdest* ﬂoor plans.)
III. Background
A. Sensor Networks
1. Academic researchers have spent tons of time and resources on these. MANETs, 
other advances in technology have resulted.
2. A lot of these have uW power levels, and sacriﬁce languages, OS, and cost to get 
there---especially cost, with many nodes costing $500 or more. Each.
3. I can't afford this. I want something I can afford to break, to lose, and even to have 
stolen. I want it an order of magnitude cheaper, and I want it to run Linux. (Ubuntu or 
Debian, if possible.)
Background: Large-
Scale Surveillance
• Believe it or not, we knew this was happening before 
PRISM
• In my original outline: “One can assume that they have 
solved all of the problems involved in CreepyDOL 
before me, and that they should, rightfully, be cited as 
prior art. I'd love to do so; as soon as they publish their 
work, I'll be happy to cite them.”
• Heh heh heh.
• Pour one out for the Intelligence Community: a lot of 
this stuff is a pain to ﬁgure out
Hardware!
So now let’s talk about system architecture. First: Hardware.
F-BOMB v.1 (ShmooCon 2012)
IV. System Architecture
A. Hardware: F-BOMB, version 2 (Falling/Ballistically-launched Object that Makes 
Backdoors)
1. Originally presented at ShmooCon 2012, but major advances since then; 
components now all off-the-shelf, signiﬁcantly reduced volume, weight, power draw.
It ﬁts in a CO Detector
No one ever checks their CO detector to see if it has become a node in a sensor network.
The new one ﬁts much better into this case; much less cutting is necessary.
F-BOMB v.2
2. Now based on the Raspberry Pi Model A, because it's awesome, runs an easier 
version of Linux (Debian vs. Arch), and I can actually get it for cheaper than the salvage 
PogoPlugs.
