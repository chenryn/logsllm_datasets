User: Please describe a high-availability architecture solution, and design usability test cases to verify the availability of the system.
Assistant: High-availability architecture solution: High-availability architecture refers to the use of distributed systems, load balancing, redundant backup, fault detection, failover, and automatic recovery in order to ensure the continuity, reliability, stability, and recoverability of system services. System architecture constructed by technical means. A high-availability architecture solution includes the following components: 1. Load balancer: responsible for distributing user requests to multiple nodes in the cluster to achieve load balancing and increase system capacity. 2. Multiple node servers: The cluster contains multiple node servers to provide the same service. When a node goes down or fails, it will automatically transfer to other nodes to ensure service continuity and reliability. 3. Distributed storage: Distributed storage of data on different nodes to achieve high availability and fault tolerance of data. 4. Automatic fault detection and recovery: Through the automatic monitoring mechanism, it is possible to detect system errors or faults in time, and realize rapid recovery, thereby ensuring the recoverability of the system. 5. Failover mechanism: When a node goes down, it will automatically transfer to other nodes to ensure the continuity and reliability of services. Usability test cases: The following are some usability test cases that can be used to test the availability of the system: 1. Can the system start correctly and resume normal service after the server is forced to restart? 2. Disconnect the network connection of a node, and test whether the load balancer can correctly forward the request to other nodes? 3. For data failure simulation (such as unexpected power failure or forced shutdown), test the resilience of the system. 4. In a high-traffic environment, test that the load balancer can effectively distribute requests to ensure that the system will not crash due to excessive load. 5. Test the failover mechanism and recovery ability of the system for various scenarios, including sudden power failure, network failure, and hardware failure.
