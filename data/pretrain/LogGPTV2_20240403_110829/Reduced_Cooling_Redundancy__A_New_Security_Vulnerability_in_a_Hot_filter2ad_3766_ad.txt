of attackers. In the ﬁrst case, the attacker does not have any
knowledge about the target data center, such as the position
of the servers or the layout of the data center. Such attackers
just randomly choose a certain number of servers to launch
thermal attacks. To evaluate this kind of attacks, we randomly
attack different numbers of victim servers in the target data
center, and call them random thermal attacks.
Unlike the ﬁrst type, the second type of attacker owns
some advanced networking intrusion knowledge, but still does
not know the data center layout. Those advanced attackers
could launch more powerful
thermal attacks by exploiting
side-channel techniques. For example, by repeatedly creating
instances and checking IP addresses or using networking probe
techniques, an advanced attacker can achieve co-residence
on one rack. We assume that the selection of the racks for
mounting a rack-level thermal attack is random. To evaluate
those advanced attack scenarios, we conduct rack-level thermal
attacks on one or a few randomly selected racks with massive
thermal-intensive workloads. We call such attacks rack-level
thermal attacks.
In the third case, attackers may gain much knowledge of
the target data center via various approaches. For example,
they could know the overall physical layout of the target data
center through either public documents or network probing.
Also, via an elaborately long-term observation of servers in
the target data center, the attackers may roughly infer where
the hotspots could be and whether a server is located in a
hotspot, as well as the load balancing policy possibly adopted
by the data center. Though somewhat costly to acquire, such
knowledge can largely expand the damage of a sophisticated
thermal attack and be devastating to the data center. We
evaluate these well-planned attack scenarios to understand the
consequences. In such attacks, we assume that an attacker can
roughly pinpoint the positions of the target servers, and call
them hotspot thermal attacks.
2) Impacts on cooling costs: Thermal attacks not only
damage the hardware, but can also generate local hotspots in
the computer room. Those servers located in a hotspot suffer
higher environmental temperatures than others. A local hotspot
can further affect the entire data center. To eliminate any local
hotspots, the data center has to decrease the supply air tem-
perature set point. Otherwise, the hotspot might cause cooling
system failures. We ﬁrst investigate the impacts of a thermal
attack on the cooling costs. As mentioned above, existing
data centers normally deploy aggressive cooling energy saving
strategies to reduce cooling costs. The temperature raised by
a thermal attack can force the targeted data center to change
the cooling conditions, thus increasing the cooling electricity
bills. We assume that the targeted data center is equipped
with intelligent cooling adjustment mechanisms, where the
supply air temperature set point is automatically adjusted as
high as possible, in order to keep the inlet temperatures of
all servers below the redline threshold. Note that such an
intelligent cooling system is not yet adopted in most of today’s
production data centers due to their incapability of conducting
thermal monitoring for individual servers. We assume such a
system to investigate the impacts of thermal attack on even a
data center with advanced cooling systems.
We estimate the cooling cost based on the power con-
sumption of traditional CRACs, which relies on the cooling
coefﬁcient of performance (COP) and the power consumption
of all servers. It can be calculated as follows,
PCRAC =

where Pserver is the power consumption of all the servers.

We conduct three types of thermal attacks (i.e, random,
rack-level, and hotspot thermal attacks) on the targeted data
center with different numbers of servers under attack. In
thermal attacks, the position of the attacked servers plays an
important role because of the air recirculation in the computer
room. However, only in a hotspot thermal attack, an attacker
can have control on the selection of racks and servers for
mounting the attack. Due to the random selection of servers or
racks in the random or rack-level thermal attacks, we conduct
both attacks for 10 times and average the results. For the
hotspot thermal attacks, we choose those servers located in
hotspots, which have the largest thermal effects on the entire
room.
Figure 14 shows the cooling costs under the three types
of thermal attacks with different numbers of attacked servers,
indicating that thermal attacks can signiﬁcantly increase the
cooling costs. Even with only 20 servers under a thermal
attack, which is less than 2% of all servers, the cooling costs
increase by about 5∼20% on average. The attack becomes
more powerful with more servers under attack. For example,
when 50 servers are under attack, the data center has to pay
58% more cooling costs compared to the normal case.
Among those three types of attacks, the hotspot attack
again consumes the highest cooling costs compared to the
other two attacks. It indicates that the locations of the attacked
servers indeed impact the effectiveness of thermal attacks. Due
to air recirculation, servers in speciﬁc locations can be used
to magnify the heat generated by the attack. We can also see
that the rack-level attack consumes more cooling costs than the
random attack. The reason lies in the fact that, by attacking
adjacent servers, the heat can be easily accumulated to form a
local hotspot, forcing the data center to lower the temperature
set point of the cooling system, resulting in higher cooling
costs.
3) Cooling failures: A snapshot view. We simulate thermal
attacks using the server trace obtained from one of the largest
cloud service vendors. The targeted data center is supposed
to have a smart scheduler that performs load balancing and
adjusts the supply air temperature of CRACs in the room, with
the minimum supply air temperature of 16◦C [44]. The redline
threshold for the inlet temperature is set to 25◦C, which is
higher than the set points used in most existing data centers.
We simulate thermal attacks with thermal-intensive workloads.
As shown in Figure 6 in Section III, the temperature can
be raised within 10 minutes. In our attack simulation, we
gradually increase the number of attacked servers with a
period of 15 minutes. The simulation results are presented
in Figure 15, where Figure 15(a) shows the dynamics of
the inlet temperature of our server block, which contains 10
servers. Figure 15(b) shows the dynamics of the supply air
temperature of the CRACs. Before the attack starts, the supply
air temperature set point is conﬁgured to 20◦C. Once the
thermal attack starts, the heat generated by the thermal attack
forces the CRACs to gradually lower the temperature set point.
As more and more servers go under attack, the temperature set
point is decreased to 16◦C. Finally, the cooling system fails
to cool down the hotspot generated by the thermal attack. To
avoid hardware damage, 10 servers are forced to shut down.
A few minutes later, since no more heat is being generated,
the scheduler adjusts the supply air temperature set point back
to 17.3◦C.
Global views. Figure 16 demonstrates the global views
of thermal conditions in the targeted data center. Each block
contains 10 servers and four blocks stack up as a rack. The
level indicates the position of a block in a rack. For example,
the level 4 means the block locates at the top of the rack.
The supply air temperature is ﬁxed as 16◦C. The attacker ﬁrst
increases the utilization of controlled servers to the capping
limit by running moderate workloads. Under this scenario as
shown in Figure 16(a), the targeted data center still stays
in a health thermal condition:
the block with the highest
temperature is about 22◦C. After that, the attacker switches
all moderate workloads to thermal-intensive workloads. As
Figure 16(b) shows, although all servers’ utilizations remain
unchanged, the thermal condition seriously deteriorates. The
inlet temperature of multiple blocks at the right corner is
approaching the redline threshold, and one of them already
surpasses the redline temperature (25◦C). Such results indicate
that existing utilization-based load balance cannot defend
against thermal attacks.

TABLE II: Attack efﬁciency on a large data center.
Attack efﬁciency. We further explore the efﬁciency of
different attack scenarios. We check the number of servers
needed to successfully cause a local cooling system failure. We
consider three scenarios: high, medium, and low, representing
background workload utilizations around 60%, 40% and 20%,
respectively, in the data center. We also consider the impacts
of different supply air temperature. While the result for the
hotspot attack is deterministic, for the random and rack-level
attacks, due to the randomness in the or rack selection, we
conduct each type of attack ten times and take the average. All
the results are shown in Figure 17. It is clear that, with the same
supply air temperature (e.g., 16◦C), the hotspot attack requires
the smallest number of attacked servers (e.g., 30-50) to cause a
local cooling failure. Also, we are not surprised to see that the
rack-level attack achieves much higher attack efﬁciency than
the random attack, even though the rack selection is random.
For a random attack, a large number of servers are required to
cause a local cooling failure. That is reasonable as the cooling
facility in a data center is designed to support all servers even
if some of them may experience high power consumption at
the same time. However, under extreme conditions, it is still
possible to cause local hotspots even when the CRAC cooling
system is working properly.
The results further suggest that a thermal attack is more
effective when the data center workload is in the high scenario,
where the data center is already in a hot environment. Thus, by
running thermal intensive workloads in the high scenario, it is
easier to exhaust the remainder cooling redundancy and cause
a cooling failure. As the usage of data centers normally follows
speciﬁc patterns and might be leaked by side-channels, it is not
difﬁcult for a well-motivated attacker to detect the occurrence
of the high scenario.
Figure 17 illustrates the number of servers needed to cause
a cooling failure under different supply air temperature. It also
clearly indicates that the higher the supply air temperature set
by data centers, the smaller efforts are needed for attackers
to cause cooling failures. More speciﬁcally, with the supply
air temperature raising by 1◦C (e.g., from 16◦C to 17◦C),
the number of required servers is reduced to half. These
results imply that although a higher temperature set point of
the cooling system is able to signiﬁcantly lower the cooling
costs, as suggested in [19], this management strategy also
makes a data center more vulnerable to thermal attacks. While
cloud vendors might like a data center hot to reduce cooling
cost, malicious attackers will also like the data center hot to
much more easily launch a thermal attack. Thus, if today’s
data centers should continue raising their temperature, thermal
attacks would become a serious threat to these future more
cooling-efﬁcient data centers.
Extension to a larger scale. We extend the data center
model to include 10,240 servers to evaluate the impacts of
thermal attacks in a larger scale. For hotspot attacks, we
achieve quite similar results as before: with the knowledge
of the locations of controlled servers, just tens of servers are
enough to cause a local hotspot. We list the results of rack-level
attacks in Table II. As we can see, if the attacker can achieve
rack-level co-residence, controlling 5% of servers is sufﬁcient
to cause a cooling failure. Note that the rack selection is still
random in this rack-level attack model. Thus, it is feasible
for an advanced attacker to cause a local hotspot and even
a cooling failure in a large data center. Moreover, such a
potential threat would be more serious in the future given the
fact that cloud vendors have been continuing to deploy more
servers in their data centers to meet the rapidly increasing
cloud service demands.
Financial
losses caused by cooling failures. Cooling
failures are devastating to cloud vendors and various services
hosted in their data centers. Since one physical server could
be shared by dozens of VMs in a cloud environment, the
shutdown of even a single server would lead to the disruption
12
of many services and signiﬁcant ﬁnancial losses. It is reported
that the four-hour outage of Amazon Web Services S3 in
February 2017 caused an incredible loss of $150 million for
S&P 500 enterprises, plus with a loss of $160 million for U.S.
ﬁnancial services [2]. In 2016, Delta Airline also suffered a
loss of $150 million in a ﬁve-hour disruption of their data
center [4].
C. Attack Cost Analysis
The cost of mounting a thermal attack against a data center
mainly lies in subscribing the computing services offered in
the data center, in which the dedicated server hosting is the
most expensive service and its usage sets the upper-limit of
the attack cost. A dedicated server service enables a client to
own an entire physical server without any resource sharing
with others, allowing a thermal attack to be mounted by fully
exploiting its computing sources for heat generation.
The price of an Amazon EC2 dedicated server with 20
Cores is $1.84 per hour [1]. Assume that each thermal attack
uses 50/100/400 dedicated servers and lasts 60 minutes as our
simulation results show the cooling failure occurs within one
hour of the thermal attack being launched. Therefore, to own
50/100/400 dedicated servers for one hour, the attacker just
needs to pay $92/$184/$736, for mounting a hotspot attack, a
rack-level attack, or a random attack, respectively. However,
based on our simulation results, such thermal attacks are
powerful enough to cause a cooling failure in a computer room
with 1,280 servers.
Compared with service subscription costs, the other costs
for mounting a thermal attack is minor. Although it is techni-
cally challenging, there is no extra ﬁnancial cost for conducting
advanced network probing to explore the layout of a data
center. Even if VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) has been deployed
to lower the risk of tenant co-residence, a recent work proposes
cost-effective attack strategies to achieve co-residence without
much cost. For example, it just costs 14 cents to have a more
than 90 percent chance of achieving co-residence on Google
Computing Engine [50].
VI. DEFENSE APPROACHES
The root cause of thermal attacks is the adoption of aggres-
sive cooling energy saving policies in the data centers, which
results in heavily reduced cooling redundancies. Although
this thermal vulnerability cannot be completely ﬁxed without
the increase of cooling redundancies, a well-designed load
balancing strategy could mitigate the thermal attacks. Obvi-
ously, the traditional utilization-based load balancing strategy
cannot effectively defend against a thermal attack, as shown
in Section III. The previous temperature-based load balancing
approaches (e.g., [40]) relying on a static thermal proﬁle run-
ning with normal workloads cannot ward off the threat either.
This is because the thermal conditions could be dramatically
changed due to thermal attacks, even completely opposite to
the static pre-calculated proﬁle. The absence of ﬁne-grained
sensors further limits the effectiveness of those approaches.
Note that a high power consumption process or high
temperature core not only affects itself, but also impacts its
neighboring servers. Thus, without a global knowledge of the
thermodynamics in a computer room, any single server based

capping mechanism (e.g., power capping) alone cannot fully
address the security threat posed by thermal attacks.
To mitigate the thermal attacks, we propose a dynamic
thermal-aware load balancing approach at the rack and data
center levels. Our thermal-aware load balancing allocates
workloads with the consideration of the thermal conditions and
physical locations of servers. Based on the thermal condition
in a rack or the entire data center, thermal-intensive workloads
would be dynamically distributed to servers to limit
