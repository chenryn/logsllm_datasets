We found nine main criteria inﬂuencing our participants’
decision to adopt a communication tool, namely (1) large user
bases and interoperability, (2) context of use, (3) services
offered by the tool, (4) QoS, (5) cost of use, (6) type of
communications (spontaneous or planned), (7) integration with
email, (8) registration (telephone numbers vs. usernames), and
(9) social inﬂuence.
Large user bases and interoperability. The ability to
reach their intended communication partners is the primary
communication goal of our participants. If most of their regular
communication partners do not use the tool, it has little utility.
As P5 put it, “there is no point of using a chat service that
not many people use”. 50 out of 60 participants explicitly
mentioned that the tools they use most frequently are those that
most of their contacts use. Thus, the small and fragmented user
bases of current secure communication tools hinder adoption
of secure tools. For example, P23 and P57 who used Pidgin
(an OTR-based tool) in the past deserted it because of lack of
utility, whereas almost all participants use WhatsApp.
Even iMessage, which is available on any device running
iOS (or Mac OS X), is not used as frequently as WhatsApp
because not all of our participants’ contacts own such a device,
and iMessage is not interoperable (i.e., does not work with
non-iOS devices). The same applies to FaceTime. Because
WhatsApp works across different platforms, it is the tool of
choice; many participants who have an iOS device use What-
sApp to communicate with contacts who also have an iOS
device, instead of using iMessage (or FaceTime). Although
they perceive iMessage as more secure (see Section IV-G),
they see the overhead of using two communication tools as
not worth the better security offered by iMessage.
Context of use. Participants use communication tools in a
variety of contexts: socializing, organizing events or creating
study groups. They perceive some tools as “more suitable” for
some types of communications: they use SMS and email for
formal conversations, whereas they prefer IM to communicate
informally with family members, friends and colleagues. Voice
calls using the mobile phone network (whether the call is
local or international) are preferred if the communication is
urgent, or, as P2 described his parents and grandparents, the
communication partner is “old-school”. Participants perceive
calling a contact as more convenient and “faster” than sending
a message via IM because they do not have to check if the
recipient is online. Also, our participants prefer SMS and IM
to email if they want the recipient to be notiﬁed quickly.
Services offered. Our participants choose speciﬁc tools
based on the services the tools offer. 55 out of 60 participants
explicitly mentioned that they use email, instead of SMS,
to send large volumes of data (e.g., media messages, ﬁles)
although many of these participants (32 out of 55) perceive
sending a message via SMS as “more secure” than sending
an email (see Section IV-F). Furthermore, 20 participants who
perceive Telegram as more secure than WhatsApp (see Section
IV-G) explicitly mentioned that Telegram does not support
calls, causing them to use the “less secure” option: WhatsApp.
Lack of utility fosters insecure behaviour: Telegram sup-
ports two chat modes: (1) default chat mode (messages are
encrypted in transit), and (2) Secret Chat mode (messages
are E2E-encrypted). However, the Secret Chat mode does not
currently support group conversations. All participants who use
Telegram do not use Secret Chat when communicating with
individuals either because the overhead of switching between
the two modes is high, or because they just forget to use
Secret Chat, especially for participants who frequently use the
default mode to send group messages. This can be conceived
as a usability problem (i.e., mode error: a type of slip where a
user performs an action appropriate to one situation in another
situation, which is common in software with multiple modes),
but is also caused by lack of utility (the secret mode does not
support group conversations).
QoS. 47 out of 60 participants assess the reliability of a
communication tool based on the QoS of voice calls and
messages they experienced. For example, P9 and P12 pre-
fer Google Hangouts because its audio has “high-quality”,
whereas P31 and P45 stopped using Google Hangouts because
they experienced “bad-quality” audio in the past. This not only
inﬂuences adoption, but also users’ perceptions of how secure
a tool is (see Section IV-G): 40 out of 60 participants said that
a tool that offers high-quality services can also be assumed to
be more secure. Thus, the perceived competence developers of
tools demonstrate by delivering high QoS makes participants
assume that they will also do a good job on security.
Cost of use. The ﬁnancial cost of using a tool is another
main factor inﬂuencing participants’ adoption decision (47 out
of 60). Participants mainly use IM when they are not in the
same country as the recipient. P2, P30 and P41 mentioned that
IM tools are not at “no cost” because they have to pay for the
Internet service most of the time. P2 reported that the cost of
the Internet service in developing countries is high.
Battery consumption is another cost our participants men-
tioned. 36 out of 60 participants said they never log out of most
of their accounts, but they do log out of their Skype accounts
because they see Skype as a “heavy” application that drains
the device battery. This in turn means it takes time and effort
to start Skype again and sign into the account. As a result, our
participants rarely use Skype for spontaneous communications.
Type of communications: spontaneous vs. planned. Par-
ticipants clearly distinguish between spontaneous and planned
communications. Many participants who use Skype (30 out of
60) use it mainly for international calls and videoconferencing.
These communications are usually pre-arranged, rather than
spontaneous. P7, for instance, said she does not use Skype
for communicating with others on a regular basis because

communication partners will not notice her messages unless
they are logged in. However, the majority of our participants
always log out of their Skype accounts (see the previous point
on battery consumption).
Integration with email. Most participants have used Ya-
hoo! Messenger for some time, but they stopped using it after
moving away from Yahoo! mail. For example, P46 and P56
mentioned that they had to speciﬁcally log in to their Yahoo!
mail account to access the chat service. 15 participants, on the
other hand, use Google Hangouts because they frequently use
Gmail (on their PC/laptop, not phone).
Registration: telephone numbers vs. usernames. Com-
munication tools that require knowledge of a contact’s phone
number also have reduced utility. WhatsApp and Facebook
Messenger are the most frequently used tools among our
participants (45 out of 60) for sending messages. However,
WhatsApp is only convenient to use when participants have
the phone number of the person they want to communicate
with, whereas in Facebook Messenger, they can search for a
particular person by name, adding to the tool’s utility.
Social
inﬂuence. A social system is a combination of
external inﬂuences (e.g., mass media) and internal inﬂuences
(e.g., social relationships) that affects participants decision
to adopt or stop using a particular tool (54 out of 60). A
newspaper article or a friend can inﬂuence adoption decisions.
Das et al. [58]–[60] have studied the role of social inﬂuence
on users’ decisions to adopt secure tools and to use speciﬁc
security features; we found some evidence in the reasons
our participants gave for adoption. For example, P56 said
she adopted Telegram because her father recommended it as
secure against eavesdropping by service providers. However,
we found she does not use the Secret Chat mode and, as
a result, her communications are not protected. She was
motivated to adopt a secure tool, but was foiled by a usability
issue (mode error).
B. Sensitive Information: Perceptions and Practices
Perceived sensitivity of information should drive the adop-
tion of secure communication tools, but this is not the case
with our participants. When we asked participants if they send
sensitive information via communication tools, they started to
use the terms “security”, “privacy”, “safety”, and “protection”,
interchangeably. However, they do not select a secure tool to
do so. Instead, they use different practices and obfuscation
techniques. In this section, we explain how our participants
deﬁne sensitive information, which practices they use to send
this information, and the information’s level of sensitivity.
How participants deﬁne sensitive information. Our par-
ticipants said they want to protect all data they transmit, and
all data stored on their personal devices. However, they regard
some information as sensitive, such as personally identiﬁ-
able information (PII), bank account details, authentication
credentials (e.g., PINs, passwords), health data, their photos,
and political views. Only P37 mentioned that any piece of
information is potentially personal and sensitive.
143
Protection practices. The majority of participants (53 out
of 60) believe that the best protection for sensitive information
is to speak to the recipient directly, instead of using a com-
munication tool. If they trust a communication partner with
the information and need to send the information urgently,
they regard voice calling or videoconferencing as most secure,
regardless of the tool used. Voice calling and videoconfer-
encing are seen as the “closest thing” to telling the recipient
face-to-face because there is “no record” of calls, as opposed
to messages (see Section IV-F for the reasons). Only seven
out of 60 participants (P2, P5, P37, P42, P45, P47 and P51)
mentioned that voice calls have the same security properties
as messages giving the reason that the same communication
tool and channel are used.
Other practices our participants perceive as secure include
sending information by post (P46), sending a voice message in
a foreign language (P17 and P48), or cutting the message into
“chunks” and sending these via different communication tools
(P20 and P43). P56 also reported sending different chunks
of information using the different modes of Telegram: when
sending a 4-digit PIN, she sends two digits via the Secret
Chat mode and the other two digits via the default chat
mode, believing the two modes of Telegram use “two different
channels”, which cannot be associated with each other.
P8 told us about using an encryption tool to encrypt a
document, sending the “encrypted document” via one com-
munication tool and the “encryption key” via another. The
encryption tool turned out to be Microsoft Word’s password-
based document encryption feature, with the password serving
as the encryption key. 10 participants have their own “code” to
exchange sensitive information via any communication tool.
They share the code (effectively a substitution cipher) with
trusted parties in advance before sending any message. They
said that the “design” of these codes or schemes must be kept
secret, so that only the parties who know the schemes can
decode the scrambled message. P13 also mentioned using the
practice of sending her password to a trusted recipient as a text
message via any tool and then changing her password later.
Level of sensitivity. 54 out of 60 participants said they
share sensitive bank account details with trusted recipients
via a phone call, but discuss political views only face-to-
face. They believe that (1) neither the government nor service
providers are interested in users’ PINs and passwords, and (2)
a government agency (especially with repressive regimes) can
target a particular person and record their calls, as portrayed
so memorably in the following movie: “The Lives of Others”.
None of our participants mentioned meta-data (e.g., identity
of sender and recipient) as worth protecting. Even when we
hinted at the potential sensitivity of meta-data, they (except for
P2 and P5) described them as “less sensitive”. Clearly, they
are not aware of the highly publicizing and debated “we kill
people based on meta-data” comment [70]. Our participants’
mental models of both the technology they are using and the
threats to their communications seem very much inﬂuenced
by traditional telephony, rather than digital communications.

C. Security Properties
Our participants used the terms “secure communications”
and “security” in previous discussions. In this section, we
analyze what security properties they expect from secure com-
munication tools. Their discussion of security properties falls
into three main categories: (1) secrecy of message content, (2)
message integrity, and (3) “no impersonation”.
Secrecy of message content. When our participants de-
scribed this property,
they did not use the terms “conﬁ-
dentiality” or “encrypted communications”. Instead, they ex-
plained that exchanged messages via a secure communication
tool should only be accessed by the sender and intended
recipient(s). Third parties, including government intelligence
agencies and service providers, should not be able to read
the messages, or listen to voice calls. P5 mentioned that
information exchanged via a communication tool should not
be “re-routed to unintended recipients”.
Message integrity. No participant mentioned unprompted
that a message should not be modiﬁed in transit (for several
reasons discussed later in Section IV-D.II). However, when we
explained the threat to them, all agreed that integrity is an im-
portant property a secure communication tool must offer. Only
three participants (P2, P5 and P28), who identiﬁed themselves
as security experts, discussed man-in-the-middle attacks and
digital signatures, the essential cryptographic mechanisms for
assuring integrity.
“No impersonation”. All participants believe a user will
be impersonated if their username and password are used to
log in to their account. They, therefore, want their passwords
stored in a secure place (the service provider’s server) where
they cannot be compromised. Many participants used the
term “hacking” in connection with this security property. Six
participants (P15, 17, 32, 43, 49, 56) expect to be notiﬁed,
and to be asked for consent, before the government or service
provider accesses their accounts. This is an expectation of
conduct by snoopers that in reality is unlikely to be met.
Our participants did not mention or describe plausible
deniability (or repudiation), forgeability, forward or backward
secrecy, recipient authenticity, or conﬁdentiality of usernames.
When we started discussing anonymous communications, all
participants mentioned that anonymity is an unimportant secu-
rity property. From our participants’ perspective, anonymous
communications mean sender-anonymity [71] and/or third-
party anonymity [71] (expressed in their own words). P2,
P6, P32, P39, P45 and P50 also mentioned that only people
who engage in political discussions need sender anonymity.
P2 incorrectly stated that Telegram and Signal (formerly
known as TextSecure) offer sender-anonymity and third-party
anonymity. He stated (also incorrectly) that Skype, Snapchat
and Telegram’s Secret Chat mode provide deniability because
they do not offer “evidence preservation”; i.e., a sender can
delete a message they have already sent.
P8, P11, P22, P27, P32, P43 and P60 suggested that
anonymous communications can be achieved by using a public
PC, creating a fake account, sending the data, and then logging
out. However, they believe this only works for communication
tools that do not require a phone number at registration time
(e.g., Facebook Messenger).
Availability is hugely important to our participants, referring
to it as “reliable connection”. However, they regard it as a
utility feature (see Section IV-A), not a security property.
D. Threat Models
Our participants described different types of adversaries
that can violate the security of communications. We describe
these adversaries and their capabilities in Section IV-D.I. In
Section IV-D.II, we explain how participants think the security
properties of secure communication tools (discussed in Section
IV-C) can be breached.
