password.  
In addition, given the high level of password reuse of HS, it 
is also important to teach students of the risks of reuse and 
emphasize that having unique passwords is a more secure 
approach. 
6  Limitations 
Our  study  has  several  limitations  which  may  limit  the 
generalizability  of  our  findings.  First,  our  sample  was  a 
convenience  sample  based  on  geography  and  personal 
connections with schools. Future studies may use alternative 
participant  recruitment  in  an  effort  to  minimize  potential 
bias. Second, the hypothetical password creation task can be 
viewed  as  contrived.  However,  it  still  provides  invaluable 
insight  on  children’s  character  choices  and  composition 
patterns in passwords. The final limitation is the use of self-
report  data.  The  youth  respondents  may  have  rationalized 
their behaviors by providing socially desirable explanations. 
Due  to  the  study  format–survey  with  brief  short  response 
questions–we weren’t able to ask follow-up questions or ask 
students to elaborate on their responses or password creation 
choices. Future studies could use mixed method techniques, 
such as including interviews, to probe deeper into youths’ 
perceptions on online security and privacy.

7  Conclusion 
This  study  finds  that  children  are  not  yet  plagued  by  the 
overwhelming  number  of  passwords  that  adults  must 
manage. Children on average reported having two passwords 
for school and two to four passwords for home, while adults 
report having up to five times that amount [8, 14].   
Reinforcing positive perceptions and practices 
It  is  important  to  promote  positive  user  perceptions  about 
passwords early on [8], and our data indicates that children 
have  reasonably  accurate  perceptions  and  knowledge  of 
passwords and authentication. Thus, cybersecurity education 
should  strive  to  reinforce  these  positive  perceptions  while 
continuing provide and promote security understandings. 
Promoting concrete understanding 
Our study also reveals that students frequently discuss the 
significance of passwords very generally and vaguely, often 
using one or two words like “information” and “safe,” and 
do  not  put  their  password  knowledge  into  practice.  This 
raises  questions  about  whether  or  not  students  actually 
understand why certain password practices exist versus just 
knowing about the practices. This, in turn, raises questions 
about whether or not, without this understanding, they will 
consistently  make  appropriate  password  choices  across 
technologies and technological applications.  
Bridging gap between knowledge and behavior 
Further,  this  study  reveals  that  children  have  appropriate 
perceptions  and  knowledge  of  passwords,  but  also 
demonstrate  bad  password  habits  that  are  contradictory  to 
this knowledge. Students as young as third grade understand 
that passwords provide access controls, protect their privacy, 
and ensure their stuff’s safety. They also practice some good 
password practices such as memorizing passwords, limiting 
writing  passwords  down,  keeping  their  passwords  private, 
and  logging  out  after  sessions.  However,  many  students 
exhibit password behaviors that do not align with their stated 
understanding of passwords, such as sharing passwords with 
friends, reusing passwords and using personal information 
when creating passwords. 
This gap between students’ stated password knowledge and 
their password behavior is an important next step for research 
surrounding  children’s  password  use  and  education.  More 
mixed  methods  studies  with  more  extensive  questioning 
methods like interviews are needed to help better understand 
the nuances of children’s perceptions of passwords, as well 
as the gap between knowledge and use. Understanding these 
nuances is important for thinking about how to better educate 
students  about  password  behavior  and  online  privacy  and 
security, and how to move their knowledge into appropriate 
practice.
