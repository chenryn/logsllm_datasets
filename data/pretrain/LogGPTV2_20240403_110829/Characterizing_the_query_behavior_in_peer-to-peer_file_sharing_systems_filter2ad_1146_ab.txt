slightly lower fraction in North America during the daytime hours 
at  the  measurement  node.  As  we  will  show  in  Section  4,  Asian 
peers tend to maintain shorter sessions than the peers in the other 
two continents, so the number of Asian peers that are more distant 
than  one-hop  from  the  measurement  node  may  be  somewhat 
underestimated. We thus conclude that the Gnutella client software 
connects to one-hop peers that are widely distributed and appear to 
be randomly selected with respect to geographical location. 
In a second experiment, we observe the number of shared files as 
reported in PONG messages from all peers and in PONG messages 
from  one-hop  peers.  Figure  2  plots  the  fraction  of  each  class  of 
peers  that  report  each  number  of  shared  files  from  zero  to  one 
hundred.  We  observe  that  one-hop  peers  are  again  reasonably 
representative  of  the  total  peer  population  with  respect  to  the 
number of shared files. 
In  the  next  section  we  characterize  the  behavior  of  the  one-hop 
peers,  noting  that  the  measures  presented  in  Figures  1  and  2  are 
consistent  with 
the  one-hop  peers  are

Filtering sessions with a length less than 64 seconds will eliminate 
anomalies in statistics for session duration and number of queries 
issued  per  session.  In  addition,  the  following  query  messages  are 
sent by some peers soon after connecting to the measurement peer:  
4.  QUERY messages with interarrival time of less than 1 second, 
5.  QUERY messages with identical interarrival times. We found 
some peers that issued query messages in regular intervals, e.g., 
10 seconds.  
Each  of  these  queries  indicates  automated  client  behavior.  They 
appear to be automated re-queries for queries that were issued by 
the  user  prior  to  connecting  to  the  measurement  peer.  Although 
queries identified by rules 4 and 5 were generated automatically by 
the system software, the user query that was issued before the client 
connected to the measurement peer is important. Thus, we include 
these  queries  in  the  measures  of  the  query  popularity  distribution 
and  the  number  of  queries  per session,  but  not  in  the  measure  of 
query  interarrival  time  since  the  observed  arrival  time  was 
determined by the system software.  
Table 2 shows the number of queries that are discarded when each 
of  the  first  three  rules  is  applied  in  sequence,  and  the  number  of 
queries  that  are  not  counted  in  the  measure  of  query  interarrival 
time due to rules four and five. We note that the number of queries 
discarded  by  each  of  the  first  three  rules  is  substantial.  For 
example, nearly half the queries are discarded by the second rule, 
which identifies queries that are repeated by the system to obtain 
further  results,  rather  than  queries  that  are  part  of  the  user 
workload. Considering the large fraction of automatically generated

4.  PEER CHARACTERIZATION 
Each connected (one-hop) peer session can be classified as either 
active or passive. Active peers send at least one query in order to 
locate files to download. Passive peers are connected in the overlay 
network  but  perform  no  queries.  These  peers  constitute  an 
important  component  of  a  realistic  workload  because  they  don’t 
generate any query load and because they form part of the overlay 
network 
to  queries.  Thus,  our 
characterization includes both types of peers. 
A key goal is to characterize all distributions needed for generating 
a synthetic workload that accurately captures the query behavior of 
individual  peers.  Key  correlations  among 
the  workload 
characteristics need to be represented in the synthetic workload. We 
thus  begin  in  Section  4.1  by  characterizing  the  fraction  of  peers 
from  each  of  the  three  continents  where  most  peers  reside,  as  a 
function of the time of day. Section 4.2 characterizes the total query 
load from each of the three continents as a function of the time of 
day,  and  identifies  periods  in  the  day  when  the  load  from  each 
continent  is  highest.  The  session  characteristics  that  need  to  be 
represented  in  a  synthetic  workload  will  then  be  conditioned  on 
geographic  location  and/or  on  high-load  periods  of  the  day,  for 
whichever characteristics are found to be heterogeneous in either of 
those domains. 
To characterize connected peer sessions, we analyze the fraction of 
peers  that  are  passive  (Section  4.3),  the  distribution  of  session 
duration for passive peers (Section 4.4), the distributions of number 
of queries and session duration for active peers (Section 4.5), and 
the  query  popularity  distribution  (Section  4.6).  The  correlations 
among these session characteristics and the geographic location of 
the peer or the time of day are determined as each characteristic is 
analyzed.  Significant  correlations  are  captured  in  the  form  of 
conditional  distributions,  so  that  the  correlations  can  easily  be 
represented in the synthetic workload. Model distributions that fit 
the measured distributions for the important session characteristics 
are  given  in  the  Appendix,  along  with  representative  graphs  that 
illustrate  how  closely  the  model  distribution  fit  the  measured 
distribution.  The  algorithm  for  generating  a  synthetic  workload 
from the measured characteristics is summarized in Section 4.7. 
4.1  Geographic Distribution 
As first measure of the workload characterization, we analyze the 
geographic distribution of peers conditioned on time of day at the 
measurement node. Curves for the average fraction of peers from 
each  continent  during  each  hour  of  the  24-hour  day  have  been

presented in Figure 1. The fraction of peers from each continent on 
the “outlier days” (i.e., days with largest or smallest fraction from 
each region) only differ by about ±5% in absolute value from the 
averages shown in the figure. Furthermore, the plot of the number 
of  connections  to  peers  in  any  region  for  each  5-minute  interval 
during a given hour on any given day (omitted to conserve space) 
also  does  not  fluctuate  by  more  than  about  ±5-10  peers  over  the 
hour.  Thus,  the  fractions  of  peers  from  each  region  during  each 
hour  in  Figure  1  are  approximately  representative  of  the  relative 
mix of peers during each hour on any give day. 
We observe from Figure 1 that the relative fraction of peers from 
each  geographical  region  changes  modestly  as  a  function  of  the 
time  of  day.  For  example,  the  fraction  of  North  American  peers 
decreases from about 80% to about 60% during the hours of 10pm 
–  6am  in  North  America,  and  then  rises  gradually  back  to  80% 
between 6am – 10pm. European and Asian peers constitute much 
lower  fractions  of  the  Gnutella  peers.  The  largest  fraction  of 
European peers, close to 20%, is observed during noon – midnight 
in  Dortmund.  At  about  6am,  their  fraction  constitute  only  about 
6%.  Similarly,  the  highest  fraction  of  Asian  peers  (about  13%) 
occurs during the afternoon and evening hours in Asia. During the 
early  morning  hours  only  about  4%  of  the  peers  are  from  Asia. 
Peers  from  other  geographical  regions  or  with  unknown  origin 
constitute approximately 5-10% of the peers. To create a synthetic 
workload,  the  interesting  mixes  of  peers  from  North  America, 
Europe, and Asia (respectively) are perhaps: 75, 15, 5 at 00:00, or 
80,  5,  5  at  3:00,  or  60,  20,  15  at  12:00.  In  the  remainder  of  this 
paper we characterize the peers in the three continents where most 
peers reside.

Figure. 3. Load Measured in Number of Queries vs. Time (30 minute bins) 
4.2  Periods of Peak Load 
To  analyze  potential  correlations  between  the  various  workload 
measures and the time of day, it is useful to identify periods of time 
that have high and low query activity for each geographical region. 
To do this, Figure 3 plots the number of queries received from the 
one-hop peers from each geographical region in bins of 30 minutes 
as  a  function  of  time  of  day.  The  average  values  of  each  bin  are 
averaged over the entire measurement period. Except for the Asian 
peers, the average curves for each region show a similar correlation 
to time of day as Figure 1. In particular, we identify the following 
key  periods  from  Figure  3:  03:00-04:00  (peak  in  North  America, 
sink  for  Europe),  11:00-12:00  (sink  for  North  America,  peak  for 
Europe),  13:00-14:00  (sink  for  North  America,  peak  for  Europe, 
peak for Asia), and 19:00-20:00 (joint peak for North America and 
Europe).  
The  minimum  and  maximum  curves  indicate  a  high  variance  for 
each bin. Plots of the number of queries during each hour during an 
“outlier  day”  –  i.e.,  a  day  with  the  minimum  or  maximum  total 
number  of  queries  from  the  geographical  region  –  (omitted  to 
conserve  space)  shows  that  the  number  of  queries  is  not 
consistently low or high during each 30-minute interval, but instead 
varies  greatly  from  one  interval  to  the  next,  due  to  statistical 
fluctuations in a relatively small sample size during each interval. 
That  is,  statistically,  some  peer  sessions  issue  larger  or  smaller 
number  of  queries  than  the  average,  causing  the  total  number  of 
queries during the interval to differ significantly from the average. 
4.3  Fraction of Passive Peers 
We plot the fraction of passive peers versus time of day in Figure 4. 
In this figure, we count the number of peer sessions that begin in a 
1-hour interval that issue no queries (during the entire session) and 
calculate  the  ratio  to  all  sessions  that  start in  the  same  hour.  The 
average  for  each  1-hour  interval  is  computed  over  the  entire 
measurement  period.  We  observe  that  the  fraction  is  almost  the 
same  for  each  geographical  region,  with  about  80%  to  85%  for 
North America, 75% to 80% for Europe, and 80% to 90% for Asia. 
Furthermore, the fraction of passive peers fluctuates only by about 
5% over time of day. Comparing similar graphs with averages for 
each  bin  calculated  over  the  first  and  the  second  half  of  the 
measurement period the fraction of passive peers does not change. 
Due  to  space  limitations,  we  do  not  show  these  figures.  We 
conclude  from  these  results  that  the  fraction  of  passive  peers  is 
approximately  independent  of  time  of  day  and  of  multiple-day 
periods.  
4.4  Connected Session Duration Passive Peers 
As  a  passive  peer  does  not  send  queries,  the  connected  session 
duration  is  given  by  the  time  during  which  the  peer  maintains  at 
least  one  connection  to  another  peer.  To  check  the  correlation 
between  session  duration  and  geographical  region,  Figure  5  (a) 
plots the complementary CDF (CCDF) of session duration broken 
down to the geographical region. We observe that session duration 
shows a significant correlation to geographical region. For instance, 
in  Asia  85%  of  the  sessions  are  shorter  than  2  minutes,  in  North 
America  and  in  Europe  only  75%  and  55%  are  shorter  than  2 
minutes, respectively. Sessions of an intermediate duration between 
2 and 200 minutes constitute 12% in Asia, 20% in North America, 
and 35% in Europe. Longer sessions make up 3% in Asia, 6% in 
North  America,  and  10%  in  Europe.  Note  that  session  durations 
between  17  and  50  hours  account  for  1%  of  the  sessions  in  each 
geographical  region,  indicating that a  considerable  fraction  of  the 
peers stays online for a very long time without generating queries. 
Considering the impact of multiple-day periods, we observed in an 
experiment  not  shown  that  the  distribution  of  session  duration  is 
nearly identical in the first and the second half of the measurement 
period.
