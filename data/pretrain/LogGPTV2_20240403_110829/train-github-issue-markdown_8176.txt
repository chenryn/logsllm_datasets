# v7 Regression
**Potential Commit/PR that introduced the regression**  
#10161
**Description**  
When we recently upgraded from `7.5` to `7.8` we experienced a bundle size
increase from `~3,4 MB` to `3.5 MB` minified (`+90 KB` difference)
When we checked the bundle diff, we found that a function
`_getRequireWildcardCache` is being re-defined for every module in our
application and adds quite a bunch of code in total.
Searching for the function, we found that it's a new feature in babel `7.6`.
Here's a blog post where @ifsnow , who built this feature explains it nicely:

faster-4ab20915a599481ab8fbb4993db38709 (thanks for the explanation by the
way)
But what we find now is that besides the performance improvement we're hoping
to get, we're seeing this regression in bundle size.
Is that to be expected? Is it possible to opt-out of this optimization?
