## Current Behavior
The regular expressions in `docs/src/modules/utils/parseMarkdown` use `\n` for
a new line, while it should be `\r\n` on windows, which results in those
regular expressions can't match any string.
## Expected Behavior
It should distinguish the current platform and modify the regular expressions.
## Context
It affects the website's content. In API papes, the header information
`filename: /src/AppBar/AppBar.js` will display above the title, and the button
`EDIT THIS PAGE`'s url will be wrong.
