### Title: Compromising the macOS Kernel through Safari by Chaining Six Vulnerabilities

Compromising a kernel via a web browser is the ultimate goal for offensive security researchers. Despite continuous efforts to eliminate vulnerabilities and introduce various mitigations, achieving a remote kernel exploit from a browser remains extremely challenging, if not seemingly impossible.

In this talk, we will present our Safari exploit, which was submitted to Pwn2Own 2020. By chaining six distinct vulnerabilities, our exploit successfully compromises the macOS kernel, starting from the Safari browser. This exploit bypasses all major macOS mitigations, including Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), Data Execution Prevention (DEP), sandboxing, and even System Integrity Protection (SIP).

We will delve into each of the vulnerabilities used in this exploit, demonstrating not only cutting-edge hacking techniques but also highlighting the challenges involved in protecting complex systems such as browsers and operating systems, and in implementing effective mitigations. Additionally, we will introduce a novel technique that reliably exploits a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability in macOS.
