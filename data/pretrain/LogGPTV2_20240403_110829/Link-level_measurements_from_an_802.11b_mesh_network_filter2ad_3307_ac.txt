Node Pair
Figure 16: The eﬀect of varying the transmit power
level on the delivery probability, for 1 Mbit/s. For
example, raising the power level from 10 to 40 milli-
watts almost doubles the number of nodes that have
delivery probabilities of 40% or more.
Figure 17: Throughput for each link at each 802.11b
transmit bit-rate. The throughput values are in
units of received 1500-byte packets per second. The
node pairs are sorted by their throughput at 11
Mbit/s.
ple, there are many links with high loss rates at 1 Mbit/s
that would have a higher throughput at 11 Mbit/s. These
observations imply that bit-rate selection must be based on
explicit measurements of throughput at the diﬀerent rates,
rather than on indirect prediction.
8.
Interference from 802.11 Sources
Another possible reason for the links with intermediate
delivery probabilities could be interference from other 802.11
activity. Packets could be lost due to interference from other
802.11 senders on the same channel, or from overlapping
channels.
These packets might be data, or they might be periodic
802.11 beacons. Data traﬃc would probably be bursty,
while beacons would likely maintain a relatively steady rate.
Roofnet itself generates no 802.11 beacons because it runs
in pseudo-IBSS mode.
Table 1 shows the number of packets per second received
on each channel, averaged over all the Roofnet nodes. These
numbers were acquired with the Prism 2.5 “monitor” mode,
which reports all packets on a given channel, not just pack-
ets in the same BSSID as the node. During the experiment,
all the Roofnet nodes were placed in monitor mode simulta-
neously. In this mode Roofnet itself produces no packets, so
all packets in the table are from non-Roofnet sources. The
measurements were taken just after midnight.
Table 1 shows that, when our experiments run, most in-
telligible 802.11 traﬃc takes the form of beacons rather than
data packets. On channel 3, which the experiments in this
paper use, each Roofnet node received an average of 46 pack-
ets per second.
Are the numbers of packets received from non-Roofnet
sources consistent with the quantity of losses observed by
Roofnet receivers? Figure 18 shows a scatter plot, with one
point per Roofnet pair, relating the number of losses per sec-
ond during a broadcast experiment to the number of pack-
ets per second observed by the receiver on the same channel
during an immediately preceding monitor experiment.

Table 1: Data and beacon packets per second re-
ceived on each channel, averaged over all Roofnet
nodes. These numbers include all frames recognized
by the 802.11 hardware in “monitor” mode, includ-
ing non-Roofnet traﬃc and damaged frames.
While the numbers of foreign packets are of the same order
of magnitude as the numbers of lost packets, there does not
seem to be any correlation between foreign packets received
by each receiver and Roofnet packets lost by each receiver. It
does not seem likely that foreign 802.11 packets on channel
3 are causing Roofnet losses.
9. Effect of Multi-path
A receiver may hear not just the signal that travels di-
rectly from the sender, but also copies of the signal that
reﬂect from objects such as buildings. The reﬂected signals
follow longer paths than the direct signal, so the receiver sees
the combination of multiple copies of the signal at diﬀerent
time oﬀsets. The Intersil HFA3873 baseband processor in
the Prism 2.5 chip-set has a RAKE receiver and equalizer
capable of suppressing reﬂected copies with delays of up to
250 nanoseconds [1]. However, studies of outdoor urban ra-
dio propagation [13, 5] ﬁnd that delay spreads often exceed
one microsecond. Theoretical models [4] demonstrate that
