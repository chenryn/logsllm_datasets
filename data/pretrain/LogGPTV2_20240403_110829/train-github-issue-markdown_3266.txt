### Reproducing Code Example

```python
import numpy as np

# Assuming `data` is a pandas DataFrame with a datetime index
time_type = data.index.dtype
print(time_type)  # Output: datetime64[ns, tzfile('PRC')]

# Check if the time type is equal to np.dtype('int32')
print(time_type == np.dtype('int32'))  # Output: False

# Check if the time type is in a list of integers
print(time_type in [1, 2, 3])  # Output: False

# Check if the time type is in a set containing np.dtype('int32')
print(time_type in {np.dtype('int32')})  # Output: False

# Check if the time type is in a list containing np.dtype('int32')
try:
    print(time_type in [np.dtype('int32')])
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

### NumPy/Python Version Information
- Python: 3.9
- Pandas: 1.2.4
- NumPy: 1.19.3 (The issue is resolved when upgrading NumPy)

### Question
I would like to understand why an exception is thrown when using the `in` operator with a list of `np.dtype` objects in this specific version, while using `in` with a set or the `==` operator does not cause this problem.

### Explanation
The error occurs because the `in` operator for a list in Python attempts to compare the `datetime64[ns, tzfile('PRC')]` dtype with each element in the list. In this case, it tries to interpret the `datetime64[ns, tzfile('PRC')]` as a data type that can be directly compared with `np.dtype('int32')`, which leads to a `TypeError`.

When using a set, the `in` operator uses a different mechanism for membership testing, which does not trigger the same type comparison and thus avoids the error. Similarly, the `==` operator performs a direct equality check, which also does not cause the same type interpretation issue.

Upgrading NumPy to a newer version likely resolves this issue by improving the handling of dtype comparisons.
