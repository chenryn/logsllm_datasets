## Abstract
Chu et al. (ASIACCS 2012) introduced group signatures with time-bound keys (GS-TBK), where each signing key is associated with an expiry time \( \tau \). In addition to proving membership in the group, a signer must demonstrate that the current time \( t \) is less than the expiry time \( \tau \). A signer whose expiry time has passed is automatically revoked, a process known as natural revocation. Simultaneously, signers can be prematurely revoked if their credentials are compromised. The Chu et al. proposal reduces the size of revocation lists compared to Verifier-Local Revocation (VLR) schemes by assuming that most revocations are natural.

In this paper, we highlight that the traceability definition in Chu et al. does not capture the unforgeability of the expiry time, which ensures that no adversary with a signing key associated with an expiry time \( \tau \) can compute a valid signature after \( \tau \) has passed. We introduce a security model that captures this unforgeability and propose a GS-TBK scheme secure under this new model. Our scheme also offers constant signing costs, unlike previous schemes where costs depend on the bit-length of the time representation. Finally, we present implementation results, demonstrating the practical feasibility of our scheme.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Group Signatures and Revocation
Group signatures, first proposed by Chaum and van Heyst [19], allow members to anonymously prove their group membership. Following the seminal work by Boneh, Boyen, and Shacham (BBS) [11], many pairing-based constructions have been developed, such as [10, 14, 34, 35, 31, 28, 25, 21, 49]. Recently, lattice-based constructions have also emerged, e.g., [26, 30].

Providing revocation functionality is a major research topic in group signatures. This involves an authority revoking the membership of users. The challenge lies in publicly confirming whether an anonymous signer has been revoked. To address this, several approaches have been proposed:

1. **Revoked signers cannot compute a valid signature**: Schemes like Libert-Peters-Yung [33] use broadcast encryption to ensure non-revoked signers can decrypt a ciphertext, thereby proving they are not revoked. This type of scheme has higher signing costs but lower verification costs.
   
2. **Any signer can compute a valid signature, but the verifier checks for revocation**: Schemes like Boneh-Shacham VLR [12] use a revocation list to check if a signer is revoked. This type has lower signing costs but higher verification costs, especially as the revocation list grows.

### 1.2 Group Signatures with Time-bound Keys
Chu et al. [20] proposed group signatures with time-bound keys (GS-TBK), combining both revocation types. Each signing key has an expiry time \( \tau \), and signers must prove \( t < \tau \). Natural revocation occurs when \( \tau \) has passed, while premature revocation happens due to credential compromise. The size of revocation lists in GS-TBK is smaller compared to VLR schemes, assuming most revocations are natural.

### 1.3 Our Target and Contribution: A New Model and an Efficient Construction
We identify a gap in the traceability definition of Chu et al. [20] and its journal version [37], which does not cover the unforgeability of the expiry time. Specifically, an adversary with a signing key associated with an expiry time \( \tau \) should not be able to compute a valid signature after \( \tau \).

We define a new model for GS-TBK that captures this unforgeability and propose a secure scheme. Our scheme achieves constant signing costs, unlike previous schemes where costs depend on the bit-length of the time representation. We also reduce the size of the revocation list. For proving \( t < \tau \), we use the Ohara et al. methodology [47], which efficiently implements the Libert-Peters-Yung scheme using the Complete Subtree (CS) method [45].

One drawback of our construction is that signers must download expiration information \( e_{it} \) at each time \( t \). However, this allows us to achieve \( O(1) \) signing cost and \( O(R_{\text{pre}}) \)-size revocation list, where \( R_{\text{pre}} \) is the number of prematurely revoked signers.

Finally, we implement our scheme using Barreto-Naehrig (BN) curves [7] and the RELIC library [2], showing its practical efficiency.

### 1.4 Related Work
Malina et al. [38, 39] also proposed group signatures with time-bound membership but do not consider premature revocation. Additionally, their schemes require including some expiry time information in the signature, which may leak partial information about the signer's identity.
