Question: "A software company is designing a new Android application that needs to support backwards compatibility for signature verification across various Android versions and provide enhanced security against APK modification. Which APK Signature Scheme should the company implement, and what are the benefits and drawbacks of this choice?"
 "A": "APK Signature Scheme v2, as it offers faster verification and more comprehensive protection against modification but doesn't support proof-of-rotation for backward compatibility."
 "B": "APK Signature Scheme v3, as it adds support for SDK version information and proof-of-rotation structure for backward compatibility but requires the old signing certificates to sign the new set."
 "C": "APK Signature Scheme v4, as it provides extremely efficient file hash calculation through fs-verity but requires an additional v2 or v3 signature and is only supported on Android 11 and up."
 "D": "APK Signature Scheme v1, because it is the oldest and most widely supported scheme but has slower verification times and less comprehensive protection against modification."
Answer: B
