### Bug information
  * **Babel version:** 6.2.0
  * **Node version:** v4.2.1
  * **npm version:** 2.14.7
### Description
Would it be possible to add a commonStrict option like there was in Babel 5?
I'm finding my files are ~3kb bigger after moving from Babel 5 to Babel 6. My
Babel 5 config had modules: 'commonStrict' which reduced file size.
