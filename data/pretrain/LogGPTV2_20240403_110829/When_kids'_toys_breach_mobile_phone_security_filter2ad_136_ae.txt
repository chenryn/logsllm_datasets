### 6. Discussion

Given the low cost of the robots and the simplicity of the attack, we believe that such an attack would be realistically launched by adversaries if touch-based authentication were to become widely deployed in its current form. For more sophisticated adversaries who may employ advanced robots or enhanced designs of the same robot, combined with information gathered about the intended victim, the impact of the attack could be even more severe. Our findings not only call for a more stringent performance evaluation of touch-based authentication systems but also highlight the need for research into technologies that can defend against a broader family of robotic attacks, one instance of which has been demonstrated in this paper.

### Appendix 1: Some Robot Design Considerations

**Pinion and Rack Gear:** For the pinion and rack gear to remain engaged throughout the attack, the finger and its attached mechanism must exert sufficient weight on the gears. This weight should be adequate to ensure smooth movement without being excessive.

**Play-doh Fingers:** In its original state, play-doh is too soft to make a firm finger. We exposed the play-doh to fresh air for a few days to harden it slightly. Care must be taken to ensure it does not become too hard.
