tion. Given the low cost of the robots and the simplicity
of the attack, we believe that the attack would realistically
be launched by adversaries if touch-based authentication got
widely deployed in its current form. For sophisticated ad-
versaries who may use more advanced robots (or advanced
designs of the same robot) in conjunction with information
gleaned about the intended victim, the eﬀect of the attack
could even get much worse. Our ﬁndings do not only call for
more stringent performance evaluation of touch-based au-
thentication systems, but should also motivate research into
technologies which could defend against the larger family of
robotic attacks, one instance of which has been demonstrat-
ed in this paper.

Pinion and Rack Gear: For the pinion and rack gear to
remain engaged throughout the attack, the ﬁnger and its
attached mechanism must be able to exert enough weight
on the gears. This weight however must not be too much,
but rather should be adequate to enable smooth movement
of the gears.
Play-doh Fingers: In the state in which it is purchased
from the grocery store, play-doh is too soft to make a ﬁrm
ﬁnger. We exposed the play-doh to fresh air for a few days
to enable it to harden a bit. Care must however be taken to
ensure that it does not become too hard.
