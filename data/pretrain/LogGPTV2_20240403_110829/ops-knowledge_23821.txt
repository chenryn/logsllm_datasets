Question: Considering the types of adversaries described (Off-path, On-path, and In-path), which of the following defense mechanisms would be most effective in protecting a TCP communication from packet injection attacks?
"A": "Implementing encrypted communication using TLS to prevent adversaries from understanding or manipulating the sequence numbers in TCP packets.",
"B": "Using a firewall to block all incoming traffic from untrusted sources, significantly reducing the risk of off-path adversaries spoofing IP addresses.",
"C": "Deploying intrusion detection systems that can identify unusual traffic patterns potentially caused by adversaries injecting TCP packets.",
"D": "Enforcing strict routing controls to ensure that all TCP packets follow a predetermined path, making it harder for on-path adversaries to intercept the communication."
Answer: AC
