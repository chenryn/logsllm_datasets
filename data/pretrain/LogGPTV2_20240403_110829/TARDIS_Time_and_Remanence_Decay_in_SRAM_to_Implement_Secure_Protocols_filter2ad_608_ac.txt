will report an error indicating unexpected temperature
changes.
Pulse Attacks. A more sophisticated attack is a combi-
nation of the cooling and heating attacks such that the
temperature would remain the same in the beginning and
the end of the attack. It should be noted that this is not
a trivial attack because the adversary needs to restore
the original internal temperature to prevent the thermal
sensor from noticing any difference. A defense against
pulse attacks is to implement a thermal fuse [10] on the
chip that will activate when the chip is exposed to a high
temperature. The activation of this fuse will then either
notify the TARDIS of temperature tampering on the next
boot-up or possibly prevent the system from booting up
at all.
Voltage Control Attack. Another possible attack sce-
nario would be to power up the system wirelessly to a
minimum voltage that is not sufﬁcient for booting up but
sufﬁcient for stopping the memory decay. This would pre-
vent the device from noticing the unauthorized reader and
it would stop the memory from decaying further (see Fig-
ure 8). The voltage control attack can freeze the TARDIS
timer at a speciﬁc time as long as it sustains the power sup-

augmented this tag with a piezo-element [20] so that it
can audibly alert the user to events.
Implementation: We have implemented a TARDIS li-
brary that provides the procedures INIT and EXPIRE listed
in Algorithm 1. For the three implemented protocols,
a 1-bit precision of time–whether or not the timer had
expired–was enough. The programs used for all three
protocols are similar and are shown in Algorithm 2. The
tag was programmed to call the EXPIRE procedure upon
power-up; if the timer had expired, it would respond to
the reader and call INIT; otherwise, the tag would buzz its
piezo-element. In the case of the squealing credit cards
protocol the tag was programmed to respond to the reader
after buzzing, but for the two other applications, the tag
stopped communicating with the reader.
We used a ThingMagic reader [51] and its correspond-
ing antenna to query the tag. When the tag was queried for
the ﬁrst time upon removal from the RF ﬁeld, it buzzed.
The tag stayed quiet whenever it was queried constantly
or too quickly.
Experimental Setup: To measure the TARDIS resolu-
tion time on this platform, we powered up the tag to 3.0 V
using an external power supply and then disconnected it.
We observed the voltage drop over time on an oscilloscope
and measured the elapsed time between loss of power and
when SRAM decay has ﬁnished.4 We conducted our ex-
periments on ﬁve tags, which use a 10 µF capacitor as its

because of the inherent design of the readers. Many fac-
tors (e.g., distance) affect the voltage received by the tags
and tags are very sensitive to environmental effects. The
readers are also generally designed to ﬂood the targeted
environment with energy to provide the tags in range with
more than the maximum required power [54]. Excessive
power that may have been generated by these devices is
then ﬁltered out in tags using voltage regulators. To im-
plement this attack, we imagine the adversary would need
to control the input voltage to the tag with a very high pre-
cision. If the tag voltage for any reason drops, the SRAM
will decay irreversibly. At the same time, the adversary
would need to prevent the tags from fully powering up
and noticing the unauthorized reader.
6 Factors Affecting SRAM Decay
In our evaluation of the TARDIS, we examine the de-
cay behavior of SRAM and three factors that have major
effects on this behavior. All experiments use the same
circuit (Figure 6), and follow the same general procedure.
Experimental Setup: A microcontroller runs a program
that sets all available memory bits to 1. The power is
then effectively disconnected for a ﬁxed amount of time
(off -time). When power is reapplied to the chip, the pro-
gram records the percentage of remaining 1-bits to mea-
sure memory decay, and then it resets all bits to 1 in prepa-
ration for the next time power is disconnected. A Data
Acquisition (DAQ) unit from Agilent (U2541A series)
precisely controls the timing of power-ups and power-
downs between 3 and 0 Volts, and also measures the volt-
age across the microcontroller throughout the experiment.
An inline diode between the power supply and micro-
controller models the diode at the output of the power
harvesting circuit in RFIDs; it also prevents the DAQ
from grounding VCC during the off-time when the DAQ
is still physically connected but is not supplying power.
In all experiments, microcontrollers from the TI MSP430
family are used to ensure maximum consistency. The
microcontroller used in all experiments is MSP430F2131
with 256 B of SRAM unless stated otherwise.
In all of the experiments, temperature is controlled by
conducting all tests inside of a Sun Electronics EC12 En-
vironmental Chamber [47] capable of creating a thermally
stable environment from −184◦C to +315◦C with 0.5◦C
precision. We use an OSXL450 infrared non-contact
thermometer [33] with ±2◦C accuracy to verify that our
microcontroller has reached thermal equilibrium within
the chamber before testing. For all the experiments, we
have collected at least 10 trials.
Deﬁning Stages of Decay: Three distinct stages of de-
cay are observed in all experiments. Figure 7 illus-

The microcontroller is held in an environmental chamber
to ensure consistent temperature during the tests. The

microcontroller and records the voltage decay.

trates the three stages of SRAM decay measured on a TI
MSP430F2131 with 256 B of SRAM and a 10 µF capac-
itor, at 26◦C. We vary the off -time from 0 to 400 seconds
in 20-second increments. In the ﬁrst stage, no memory
cells have decayed; during the second stage, a fraction of
the cells, but not all, have decayed; by the third stage the
cells have decayed completely (see Table 4 for a summary
of term deﬁnitions). Observations made during Stages 1
or 3 provide a single bit of coarse information, indicating
only that Stage 2 has not yet begun or else that Stage 2
has already been completed. Observations made during
Stage 2 can provide a more accurate notion of time based
on the percentage of decayed bits.
Decay vs. Voltage: The decay rate of SRAM is expected
to depend only on its voltage level (Section 7). Temper-
ature, SRAM size, and circuit capacitance all affect the
rate of voltage depletion and thus only have secondary
effects on memory decay. Our experimental results (Fig-
ure 8) for ﬁve sets of tests (each at least 10 trials) support
this hypothesis. The same setup as explained before was

MicrocontrollerDAQ+-Figure 7: The TARDIS presents a three-stage response pattern according to its amount of decay. Before 175 seconds,
the percentage of bits that retain their 1-value across a power-off is 100%. For times exceeding 225 seconds, the
TARDIS memory has fully decayed. The decay of memory cells between these two thresholds can provide us with a
more accurate measurement of time during that period. This graph presents our results measured on a TI MSP430F2131
with 256 B of SRAM and a 10 µF capacitor at 26◦C.
used and ﬁve different temperatures (one with a 10 mF
capacitor and four of them without) were tested.
Impact of Temperature: The work of Skoroboga-
tov [44] shows that low temperature can increase the
remanence time of SRAM, and the work of Halderman
et al. [19] similarly shows that low temperature can ex-
tend the remanence time of DRAM. For the TARDIS
using SRAM decay to provide a notion of time, the in-
teresting question is the opposite case of whether high
temperature can decrease remanence. We use the same
experimental setup as before (without using capacitors)
to investigate how decay time varies across ﬁve different
elevated temperatures (in the range of 28◦C− 50◦C). The
off-time of the microcontroller varied from 0 to a maxi-
mum of 5 seconds. Figure 9 shows that the decay time
is non-zero across all temperatures. This indicates that
the TARDIS could work at various temperatures as long
as changes in the temperature are compensated for. For
the TARDIS, this compensation is done by using temper-
ature sensors which are available in many of the today’s
microcontrollers.5
Impact of Additional Capacitance: Capacitors can
greatly extend the resolution time of the TARDIS. In our
experiment, we have tested ﬁve different capacitors rang-
ing from 10 µF to 10 mF at 26.5◦C. For this experiment,
the capacitors were fully charged in the circuit and their
voltage decay traces were recorded. These traces were
later used in conjunction with our previous remanence-
vs.-decay results (Section 6) to calculate the time frame

achievable with each capacitor. Table 5 summarizes the
results for the duration of TARDIS Stage 1 and 2 based on
capacitor size. The voltage decay traces, our conversion
function (DRV Prob.), and the resulting SRAM-decay-
over-time graph can be seen in Figure 10.
Results ranging from seconds to days open the path for
a wide variety of applications for the TARDIS, as it can
now be tweaked to work in a speciﬁc time frame. Current
RFID-scale devices generally use capacitors ranging from
tens of picofarads to tens of microfarads (e.g., [2] [3]).
Although a 10 mF capacitor size might be large compared
to the size of today’s transiently powered devices, the
progress in capacitors’ size and capacity may very well
make their use possible in the near future.
Impact of SRAM Size: Our hypothesis is that SRAM
size has an inverse relation with decay time. This is ex-

pected because a larger SRAM will have a larger leakage
current and thus will drain the capacitor more quickly.
We tested three different models of MSP430 microcon-
troller with SRAM sizes of 256 B, 2 KB, and 8 KB at
28◦C with no capacitor. The DAQ sweeps off-time from
0 to a maximum of 5 seconds. The experiment results
are consistent with our hypothesis and are shown in Fig-
ure 11. It should be noted that SRAM size is not the only
difference between these three models, as they also have
slightly different power consumptions.
Impact of Chip Variation: The chip-to-chip variation
of the same microcontroller model is not expected to
have a major effect on the TARDIS. We tested three in-
stances of the MSP430F2131 with 256 B of memory and
no capacitor at 27◦C. The off-time changes from 0 to a
maximum of 2.5 seconds with increments of 0.2 seconds.
The result shown in Figure 12 matches our expectation
and shows that changes in decay time due to chip-to-chip
variation are insigniﬁcant (notice that no capacitor is used
and the temperature for one of the chips is one degree
higher). This result indicates that TARDIS would work
consistently across different chips of the same platform
and can be implemented on a system without concern for
chip-to-chip variation.
TARDIS Simulation: We veriﬁed the TARDIS mecha-
nism using SPICE simulation of a small SRAM array of
50 cells; the transistor models are 65 nm PTM, the power
pin is connected to VCC through a D1N4148 diode, and the
decoupling capacitor is 70 nF. Each transistor is assigned
a random threshold voltage deviation chosen uniformly
from range ±100 mV . Each line in Figure 13 plots the
voltage difference across the two state nodes A and B for
a single SRAM cell. Because all state nodes remain be-
tween 0V and VCC during the discharge, the differential
voltage is roughly enveloped by ±VCC as shaded in grey.
A positive differential voltage indicates a stored state of 1
(the written state), and a negative differential is a state of
0. Some of the nodes are observed to ﬂip state, starting
when VCC reaches 200 mV at 0.55 seconds after power is
disconnected. As VCC discharges further, more cells decay
by crossing from state 1 to 0. When VCC is powered again
at 1.05 seconds, each cell locks into its current state by
fully charging either A or B and discharging the other; this
is observed in Figure 13 as an increase in the magnitude
of the differential voltage of each cell.
