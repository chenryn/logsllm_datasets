These search techniques may seem complicated, but we can simplify them with a custom search tool. The 
"Linkedln" section of the tool, which you previously downloaded possesses several advanced search features, 
as seen in Figure 13.05. Most techniques mentioned in this section are available as automated queries within this 
tool.
Overall, Snapchat is a difficult OSINT resource. It is available officially as a mobile application, and there is 
minimal native web search. The majority of the content is set to auto-destruct after a specific amount of time, 
and is privately delivered from one user to another. In 2018, we started to see much more public content and in 
2020 we saw better search options. While there are some extended search options within the app itself, 1 will 
only focus on traditional web resources here. Let's start with official options within the Snapchat website.
Keyword Search: (https://story.snapchat.com/search?q=osint) This queries the search term throughout 
Snapchat. I find it to fail often, but should be attempted.

Enter a username within the search option or navigate directly to snapdex.com/celebrity/mike and view’ the 
bio, a profile picture, location data, and public "snaps". This will only be useful if you know your targets 
Snapchat name, as any additional search features appear missing. Note that creating a Snapchat username is 
optional, and many profiles cannot be searched this way.
You should expect by now' that we can use traditional search engines to query specific sites and services. A query 
of site:snapchat.com "inteltechniques" would search for any mention of "inteltechniques" within Snapchat 
across the three major search engines. Similar to Tumblr, I include Snapchat query options within the Username 
Tool, which is explained later.
Snap Map: (map.snapchat.com) This interactive map allows you to query public "Stories" by location. In Figure 
13.06, I have zoomed into LAX and 1 can click on any of the heat maps to load a post. You will sec the 
approximate time in the upper left, but not much additional information. Viewing the source code of any story 
page will display a static URL to die post, but no additional details. 1 only find this service valuable when 
monitoring a high-profile event at a specific location. The search feature allows entry of a location in order to 
quickly zoom to an area of interest.
User Search: (littps://www.snapchat.com/s/inteltechniqucs) This option 
w’hich can also sen e as the landing page for that profile.
Once you have exhausted official search options through Snapchat, you should consider third-party options. 
These will never include all Snapchat data and will usually focus on the most popular accounts. Any non-official 
Snapchat service relies on its own successful scraping of Snapchat, and no third-party options possess the entire 
Snapchat database. Therefore, we must ahvays include numerous search options. These sendees appear and 
disappear rapidly, but an online search for "Snapchat search users" should identify any replacements.

Every Google account has been issued a specific numeric ID which associates the account with any Google 
sendee used. This includes Gmail addresses, YouTube accounts, photo albums, and other areas. My goal is 
always to identify the Google ID and then research any areas which may be associated with my target. First, we 
must find the ID itself. There are several ways, let's start with the manual option.
https://get.google.com/albumarchive/100202552162672367520

We now know his interests and potential area of residence. We can also use this technique to confirm association 
from our target to malicious negative reviews. My success rate of viewing public photo albums with this method 
is low, but the availability of mapping data has been high. This will immediately display reviews of businesses 
and photos of locations which have been shared by your target with the Google Maps sendee.
Let's conduct a real example using my friend Justin Seitz as the target. We know his personal email address 
PI:EMAIL (he is the creator of Hunchly and provided permission to do this). This means that he 
has a valid Google account, so he should also have a Google ID. I used the Epieos tool to search his email. The 
result appears in Figure 13.07 (left). This identifies his Google ID as "100202552162672367520". The following 
URL displays his Google map contributions. Clicking "Reviews" presents the content in Figure 13.07 (right).
Striking enter or return on your keyboard should cycle through the results. One of the results should contain 
data such as "data-member-id="uscr/human/100202552162672367520". The numbers after "human/" is the 
Google User ID of your target. I typically document this within my report for future reference. You can also 
use the automated sendee at Epieos (tools.epieos.com/cmail.php) to obtain this information. The following 
URLs would display any public photo albums and map contributions made by this target.

Tumblr was purchased by Yahoo in 2013, Verizon became the owner when it acquired Yahoo in 2017, but then 
sold Tumblr to WordPress owner Automatic in 2019. While I believe neither Yahoo or Verizon took advantage 
of the reach of this network, I suspect we will see Tumblr continue to thrive over the years under control of 
Automatic. Tumblr is half social network and half blog sendee. At the time of this writing, there were hundreds 
of millions of blogs and hundreds of billions of posts. These posts can include text, photos, videos, and links to 
other networks. The search method and layout are no longer user-friendly. The search feature will only identify 
blogs that were specifically Lagged by the creator with the provided search terms. I suggest using a custom 
Google search. As an example, I conducted a search of "osint" within the official Tumblr search and received 
three results. I then conducted the following search in Google and received the appropriate 611 results.
Most content on Telegram is encrypted private communication between individuals. However, "Channels" were 
added in 2015 and have become quite popular. These are publicly visible and often include content replicated 
from other social networks and websites. There is no official search option on telegram.org, but options exist 
based on the public data. I have found site searches on Google to be the most helpful. The following examples 
may help explain. I searched "osint" within different official Telegram domains and received very unique results 
from each.
Once you find a blog associated with your target, consider the Photo Gallery Tool explained in Chapter Four. 
It will retrieve all of the images and videos. Opening each post within a browser allows you to see and capture 
all "likes" and "reblogs". Similar to other networks such as Instagram, people can "tag" items with specific terms. 
The following URL presents any posts tagged "osint". At the time of this writing, the tag URL presented many 
more items than a keyword search on Tumblr.

1 have also found Telegram.im helpful when searching channels, users, and groups by name. It prov 
graphical interface and robust search feature. Searching "osint" through the standard search option produceo

We now know that locating someone's social network profile can reveal quite a lot about them. Just knowing a 
target name can make use of the people search engines that will identify places to seek more information. 
Unfortunately, sometimes the investigator does not know die target's name. A common scenario is an 
investigation about some type of event. This could be a specific violent crime, a bomb threat on a campus, or 
inappropriate chatter about a particular business. All of these scenarios require search engines that monitor
There have been several "hacks" in the past that would allow a type of "back door entry" into a profile that is 
marked as private. By the time these methods become known, the vulnerability’ is usually corrected by the social 
network host. Websites or applications that publicly claim to be able to access this secured data are most often 
scams or attempts to steal your own passwords. In my experience, it is best to avoid these traps and focus on 
rinding all available public information. /\t the time of this writing, an application had recently surfaced that 
claimed to be able to obtain all information from within private Facebook accounts. The program did not work, 
but installed a malicious virus instead. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.
Previously, 1 explained how to add cell phone numbers and email addresses as contacts to an Android virtual 
machine in order to supply them to various apps. When programs received the numbers directly from the 
contacts list, it believed the contacts were "friends"; therefore, they often identify the names and accounts 
associated with each number or email. 1 refer to this technique as contact exploitation, and the Android 
technique is not the only option for this type of activity’. This technique works throughout several social 
networking environments. I keep covert Gmail accounts solely for adding my target's contact information and 
asking networks to find friends based on this data. 1 am often presented with profiles in my target's true name 
as well as alias accounts.
1 believe this is the most robust Telegram Channel search option currently available. A keyword search presents 
channels which are associated with the terms and immediately displays analytics including subscribers, growth, 
and post reach. Clicking on the channel name presents further details about post behaviors and history. Figure 
13.08 displays an example.

VK is basically a Russian version of Facebook. You can create a new free account or log in using your existing 
Facebook credentials. Most search options function without logging in to an account. The page at 
vk.com/people offers advanced search options which allow filtering by location, school, age, gender, and 
interests. Most profiles publicly display a user's birthday, location, and full photo collection.
Odnoklassniki works similar to most other social media platforms. It is intended to be a way to communicate 
with friends, as well as an opportunity to network with other people with similar interests. The service is 
concentrated on classmates and old friends, and translates to "Classmates" in Russian. The official search page 
is located at ok.ru/search, but you will need to create an account to take full advantage of the options. I have 
found a targeted site search on Google to be most effective. Searching for Michael Smith would be conducted 
as follows.
social network traffic. There is an abundance of these types of sendees. Some will work better on reactive 
investigations after an incident while others show their strength during proactive investigations while monitoring 
conversations. Many of the sites mentioned here will find the same results as each other.
Overall, some of the strongest methods of searching social network traffic have already been discussed in the 
Facebook and Twitter chapters. Searching for traffic at the source, such as on twitter.com, will usually provide 
more accurate and updated content than on an aggregated website of multiple sources. Furthermore, searching 
specific sen-ices through Google or Bing may sometimes quickly locate results that would be difficult to obtain 
anywhere else. The use of the site operator previously explained will take you far. Aside from direct searches on 
social networks and targeted search engine queries, there are other options. The accuracy of the sendees 
mentioned in the rest of this chapter varies monthly. Hopefully, you will find some of these websites to have 
value in your investigations. I believe that the options in this chapter should be used to supplement, not replace, 
the results obtained from previous methods.
I had previously discouraged users from attempting searches on the first version of Social Searcher. Since then, 
I have begun to rely on their free sendee to digest data located on the main social networks. You can provide 
any keywords, usernames, or terms and receive the most recent results from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and 
the overall web. It allows email alerts to be created for notification of new content matching your query. One 
of the unique features of this website is the free ability to export search results into CSV format. This output 
contains the username, date & time, and entire message among other information. Having this in a spreadsheet 
format can be incredibly beneficial. This document also included dozens of Reddit and other network posts. 
The document could be imported into any other collection system.
While this book is heavily focused on social networks popular in the United States, they tend to be fairly global 
with an international presence. This is especially true for Facebook and Twitter. However, there are many social 
networks which are not popular within the United States that are the primary networks to local residents abroad. 
This section attempts to identify and explain the most popular foreign networks that may be used by your 
international targets.
