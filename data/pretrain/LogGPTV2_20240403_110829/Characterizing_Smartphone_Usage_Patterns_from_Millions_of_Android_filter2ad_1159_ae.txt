Findings in Diverse Usage Patterns
The popularity distribution of apps typically follows the
“Pareto” eﬀect. A large number of smartphone apps are
with only quite few download count and subscriber devices,
and contribute marginally to network usage. Such a ﬁnding
has been mentioned in various previous studies [2, 5, 7, 17].
Diurnal distribution of apps management is quite pe-
riodical during a day. B¨ohmer et al. [2] also reported some
similar results.
It is not surprising that some apps are frequently installed
together such as COMMUNICATION and SOCIAL. Apps
that come from the same vendor or have similar functional-
ities are more likely to be installed together.
An app’s installation/uninstallation ratio performs a pos-
itive correlation to its lifecycle. Most “disliked” apps are
likely to be uninstalled within 2 days.
Some apps are more network intensive than others with sim-
ilar functionalities. Similar ﬁndings were reported previ-
ously [16].
Some apps may consume a large amount of traﬃc volume at
background, but the behaviors might not be reasonable or
necessary, e.g., the flashlight and namecard apps. Some
apps are found using advertisement libraries.
A lot of apps keep long-lived TCP connection when they are
not “used” by users.
Although fragmentation is quite severe in Android devices,
most device models have only few users.
The app selection is diverse among users who take diﬀerent
device models. For example, lower-end device users prefer
the Opera browser as it is said to save traﬃc.
The network usage is diverse among diﬀerent users who have
diﬀerent price levels of device models. Lower-end device
users heavily rely on Wi-Fi. In contrast, higher-end devices
are likely to use more cellular than lower-end device users.
Implications for Relevant Stakeholders
The marketplace operators can identify which apps are
really popular and more frequently downloaded and used.
The marketplace operators should put the .apk ﬁles of
these popular apps “as close as possible” to end-users, e.g.,
by deploying Content Delivery Networks (CDN) servers.
They can further design eﬃcient mechanisms such as cache,
prefetching, and large bandwidth to make these apps fast
delivered. The apps that are downloaded by a limited num-
ber of devices in a short interval could alert marketplace
operators and end-users for further examination.
The marketplace operators can better allocate resources
such as server and bandwidth to adapt the download-
ing/updating requests. The app developers can publish
their up-to-date app versions at proper time to attract more
downloads.
The marketplace operators can improve recommenda-
tion systems, e.g., cluster the frequently co-installed apps
at a close location to allow end-users to fast download them.
The app developers can leverage this knowledge to ﬁnd
“mutual-composition” opportunities and design some APIs,
e.g., navigating to a social networking app from a news
reader app to share content. Some co-installed apps come
from the same vendors. The end-users can be cautious
to avoid undesirable app downloads. The advertisers can
deliver relevant ads in some apps. For example, earphone
advertisers can focus on users who use MUSIC and VIDEO
apps as they are correlated with SHOPPING apps.
The marketplace operators can know which apps are dis-
liked and further explore why they are abandoned. The
end-users can judge an app’s popularity even without user
reviews according to its installation/uninstallation ratio.
The marketplace operators can recommend end-users
proper apps that have similar functionalities but bet-
ter ﬁt the users’ data plan. The network providers
can also leverage this knowledge and provide special data
plan.
For example, some network providers in China
make special data-plan contract with music (such as
Baidu Music (com.ting.mp3.oemc.android) and Kuwo Mu-
sic (cn.kuwo.player)) and video apps (such as Youku
(com.cibn.tv)), and users can pay for this data plan inde-
pendently and enjoy unlimited cellular traﬃc to download
video/audio ﬁles or enjoy them online.
Such ﬁndings can remind the marketplace operators to
pay attention to these apps and warn the end-users and
the app developers. The OS-vendors can beneﬁt from
our ﬁndings by preventing these apps from potential threats.
Background network connections would consume resources
and energy, or even imply some malicious behaviors. Such
a ﬁnding reminds that the end-users should periodically
“clean up” their devices or terminate the threads of unused
apps running at background.
Such ﬁndings can suggest the app developers focus on
mainstream devices and make their apps adaptive to them.
The marketplace
recommend
functionality-similar apps to users with diﬀerent device
models.
Such ﬁndings can predict how much data plan a device will
probably use based on the same or similar device models. In
this way, the marketplace operators can recommend end-
users diﬀerent apps according to their own data plan. The
app developers can also provide some features to adapt
diﬀerent users, e.g., making their apps prefetch contents un-
der Wi-Fi network for the lower-end users.

8. THREATS TO VALIDITY
One potential limitation of our work is that the dataset
is collected from a single app marketplace in China. This
limitation may have introduced some biases caused by app
marketplace speciﬁc policies, and some of our ﬁndings may
not always hold in other app marketplaces. Care should be
given to generalize our ﬁndings to another marketplace.
Another limitation is that the users under study are mainly
Chinese, and the region diﬀerences should be considered.
The same limitation also exists in most of previous studies
that were conducted over users from a speciﬁc region, e.g.,
some states in USA [24]. To alleviate this issue, we con-
duct our study over millions of users. We believe that such
scale of users could reduce the threats. In fact, our ﬁndings
such as the Pareto principle of app popularity and user in-
terests of co-installed apps have validated the ﬁndings from
previous studies.
Because the analysis is done on one month of usage data,
some of our ﬁndings may not generalize to a longer period
of time. Mobile apps are updated very frequently, and some
potential security threats of apps, e.g., overprivilege of net-
work permissions, might be already ﬁxed in their up-to-date
versions. Meanwhile, we realize that one-month data is not
suﬃcient to predict app quality in the latest Wandoujia mar-
ketplace. We plan to evaluate our ﬁndings based on a new
half-year dataset and investigate how users and app usage
evolve.
9. RELATED WORK
Understanding user behavior of mobile apps establishes
a foundation for diﬀerent stakeholders in the research com-
munity of mobile computing, e.g., app developers, network
providers, marketplace operators, and OS vendors. A plethora
of studies have been made from diﬀerent perspectives.
Understanding User Behavior by Field Study. Given
that collecting large-scale user data is hardly feasible for
most studies, learning user behavior by ﬁeld study is al-
ways a straightforward way. A lot of studies were per-
formed over speciﬁc user groups. Rahmati et al. [19, 18]
performed a four-month ﬁeld study of the adoption and us-
age of smartphone-based services by 14 novice teenage users.
Tossell et al. [23] applied a naturalistic and longitudinal logs-
based approach to collect real usage data from 24 iPhone
users in the wild. Sanzi et al. [20] collected data from 387
Android users in India, where users pay for cellular data con-
sumed, with little prevalence of unlimited data plans. Falaki
et al. [6] found that web browsing contributed over half of
the traﬃc. Using detailed traces from 255 volunteer users,
Falaki et al. [7] conducted a comprehensive study of smart-
phone use and found immense diversity of users, by char-
acterizing intentional user activities. Lim et al. [12] made
a questionnaire-based study to discover the diverse usages
from about 4,800 users across 15 top GDP countries. Yan et
al. [25] developed and deployed an app to collect usage logs
from over 4,600 users to ﬁnd their similar interests and ex-
plore mobile apps recommendation systems for smartphone
apps. For a study closely to ours, Xu et al. [24] presented
usage patterns by analyzing IP-level traces of thousands of
users from a tier-1 cellular carrier in U.S. They identiﬁed
traﬃc from distinct marketplace apps based on HTTP sig-
natures and present aggregate results on their spatial and
temporal prevalence, locality, and correlation.
Some ﬁeld studies were made on speciﬁc apps. B¨ohmer
et al. [2, 3] made a ﬁeld study over three popular apps such
as Angry Bird, Facebook, and Kindle. Patro et al. [16] de-
ployed a multiplayer RPG app game and an education app,
respectively, and collected diverse information to understand
various factors aﬀecting application revenues.
Mining App Marketplace Data. Some types of app re-
lated data like user reviews, star ratings, and like/dislike
voting are publicly accessible. Chen et al. [4] presented AR-
Miner to extract informative user reviews and group them
using topic modeling. Fu et al. [8] presented WisCom, a
system that can analyze tens of millions user ratings and
comments in mobile app markets. Pestas et al. [17] moni-
tored and mined four popular third-party Android app mar-
ketplaces and showed that the app popularity distribution
deviates from commonly observed Zipf-like model.
Predicting Apps to Use. Some studies target predicting
the “to-be-used ” apps by collecting user logs. Shin et al. [22,
21] collected a wide range of smartphone information from
23 users, extracted and analyzed features related to app pre-
diction. Liao et al. [11, 10] proposed a temporal-based app
predictor to dynamically predict the apps which are most
likely to be used. Montoliu et al. [13] presented a frame-
work to discover places-of-interest from multimodal mobile
phone sensory data. Do et al. [5] presented a framework for
predicting where users will go and which app they are to
use in the next ten minutes from the contextual information
collected by smartphone sensors.
Compared to these studies, the major diﬀerences of our
study include the unique dataset covering millions of users,
some unique information such as app installation, uninstal-
lation, and diverse network usage. Although Chinese users
take up majority of all users, we believe that behavior pat-
terns inferred from millions of users under study should
be more generalized and comprehensive than those from
volunteers. With our dataset, we also validate some re-
sults that were reported over smaller scale of users. For
example, a small set of apps account for substantially a
large portion of downloads [17] and unique users [24], some
apps are more likely to be installed together [24, 6, 7], and
some functionality-similar apps may vary in terms of per-
formance [20]. However, besides using a diﬀerent dataset
collected from millions of users, our study explores uniquely
new ﬁndings that were not covered previously:
1. First, we make comprehensive measurement of the app
popularity from various aspects including downloads,
users, and diverse network activities.
2. Second, we explore which apps are likely to be unin-
stalled and the lifecycle of the abandoned apps.
3. Third, beyond reporting the co-installation of apps, we
further explore the possible reasons why these apps are
selected together.
4. Fourth, we make a ﬁne-granularity analysis of net-
work activities to identify the “network-intensive” apps
and “problematic” apps that consume traﬃc at back-
ground.
4715. Finally, we study the economic factor by the price of
device model, and explore how it impacts on user be-
haviors on apps usage.
10. CONCLUSION
We conducted a systematic descriptive analysis of a large
collection of mobile app usage behaviors from millions of An-
droid users. Interesting usage patterns are with respect to
app popularity, app management, app selection, app aban-
donment, network usage, and so on. Our ﬁndings provide
valuable implications for diﬀerent stakeholders in the mo-
bile app industry and in the research community of mobile
computing.
This paper mainly focuses on the descriptive analysis of
the data. Many ﬁndings of the analysis lead to interesting
research questions that can be immediately explored. Such
research tasks include predicting app quality and popularity,
optimizing app performance, and improving app recommen-
dations, etc. Development of these directions can directly
improve the Wandoujia management app and beneﬁt mil-
lions of users.
