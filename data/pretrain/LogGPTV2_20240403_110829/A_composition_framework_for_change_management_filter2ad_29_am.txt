Activities 
The Executing Process Phase encompasses a significant investment of time and 
resources for the OCM efort. Taking steps to ensure OCM activities are executed 
and the efectiveness of these activities is measured is a vital component of 
efective OCM Lifecycle Management. 
The OCM Practitioner should follow the guidance set forth in the OCM Plan and  
OCM Schedule to execute OCM activities during the Executing Process Phase. This  
includes activities in all knowledge areas. However, the OCM Practitioner must also  
monitor the efectiveness of OCM activities and adjust accordingly. For example,  
the OCM Practitioner may receive feedback that certain Stakeholder groups are  
confused regarding the purpose of the implementation, indicating the need for  
refocused  communication  activities.  In  this  case,  the  OCM  Practitioner  should  
revisit  the  Communication  Management  Plan  and  Stakeholder  Management  
Plan  to  ensure  messages  about  the  “whys”  of  the  project  are  getting  to  the  
correct audiences. For more on monitoring strategies, refer to the OCM Lifecycle  
Management section of the Initiating Process Phase chapter.

Communication throughout the project lifecycle works to inform and engage 
those involved with and afected by the change initiative. Communication eforts 
become even more vital during the Executing Process Phase when more detailed 
messages need to reach broader audiences in preparation for implementation. 
Figure 2-3 shows the progression of Communication Knowledge Area objectives 
throughout the PMLC. 
Communication focuses on providing relevant project information to afected 
Stakeholders.  During  this  process  phase,  the  OCM  Practitioner  reviews  and 
revises the Communication Management Plan based on updated Stakeholder 
communication needs and feedback on the communication process.

2.2.1 Inputs 
In order to complete the Executing Process Phase Communication activities, the 
OCM Practitioner will need a thorough understanding of the following inputs: 
Communication  Management  Plan:  The  Communication  Management 
Plan, developed in the Planning Process Phase as prescribed by the CA-PMF, 
identifies project communication needs and expectations based on Stakeholder 
requirements. It describes how information will be communicated, when and 
where each communication will be made, and who is responsible for providing 
each type of communication. 
Stakeholder  Register:  The  Stakeholder  Register,  developed  in  the  Initiating 
Process Phase as prescribed by the CA-PMF, identifies the organizations, groups, 
and individuals with a role in the project.

2.2.3 Activities 
Informing  all  afected  Stakeholders  about  the  change  initiative  is  critical  in 
obtaining project understanding and buy-in. Communication messages need to 
answer the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the change initiative and 
be tailored to Stakeholder groups. The OCM Practitioner will need to complete 
three main activities: 
•   Assess Stakeholder communication needs 
•   Update the Communication Management Plan 
•   Deliver project communications 
Executing | Page 18 
California Department of TechnologyOrganizational Change Management FrameworkExecutingCommunicationAssess Stakeholder Communication Needs 
Stakeholders  and  Stakeholder  groups  require  diferent  communication 
messages,  senders,  and  delivery  channels  depending  on  their  needs  and 
requirements. In the Initiating Process Phase, the Project Manager identified 
Stakeholders  and  Stakeholder  groups  using  the  Stakeholder  Register.  This 
work was continued in the Planning Process Phase with the development of the 
Stakeholder Management Plan, which captures the processes for Stakeholder 
identification,  analysis,  and  management.  These  tasks  are  important  to 
Communication activities as they help identify Stakeholder groups and specific 
communication distribution details. This efort should continue in the Executing 
Process Phase as Stakeholders become more involved and the communication 
process becomes more robust. 
A  self-assessment  of  communication  needs  at  this  point  will  allow  the  OCM 
Practitioner and Project Manager to update the Stakeholder Register, Stakeholder 
Management Plan, and Communication Management Plan as needed. The OCM 
Practitioner  should  utilize  the  Stakeholder  Communication  Questionnaire  in 
order to gain an understanding of Stakeholders’ communication needs, including: 
•   The Stakeholder’s current knowledge of the project 
•   Preferred and non-preferred methods of communication 
•   Preferred frequency of communications 
This  questionnaire  should  be  completed  by  a  representative  sample  of 
Stakeholders and include Stakeholders at all organizational levels (executives, 
management, and staf) and from all afected organizational units. By assessing 
a  diverse  sample,  the  OCM  Practitioner  and  Project  Manager  will  be  able  to 
review  results  and  tailor  communication  messages,  delivery  channels,  and 
timing to specific audiences. For example, if questionnaire results indicate that 
Stakeholders would like to know more about training opportunities, the OCM 
Practitioner can prepare messages to educate the appropriate audiences on 
available training courses and how to sign up. If questionnaire results indicate 
that a certain communication vehicle is inefective, the OCM Practitioner can 
alter delivery methods to suit the needs of the audience. 
For  more  information  regarding  updates  to  the  Stakeholder  Register  and 
Stakeholder  Management  Plan,  see  the  Stakeholder  Enrollment  section  of 
this chapter.

The  Communication  Management  Plan,  developed  in  the  Planning  Process 
Phase, establishes the foundation for project communications. In the Executing 
Process  Phase,  the  OCM  Practitioner  may  find  it  necessary  to  revisit  the 
Communication Management Plan based on: 
•   An assessment of Stakeholder communication needs 
•   Updates to the Stakeholder Register and Stakeholder Management Plan 
•   Alignment with the system implementation lifecycle 
The OCM Practitioner should work with the Project Manager and project team to 
review and update the Communication Management Plan as needed. This may 
require minor additions to a few sections or major revisions. At a minimum, the 
OCM Practitioner should review and consider revising the following sections of 
the Communication Management Plan: 
•   Section 4.1, Identify Stakeholder Communication Requirements: 
The OCM Practitioner should revise the Stakeholder Group and 
Communication Item columns of this section based on feedback received 
through the Stakeholder Communication Questionnaire and other 
feedback channels. 
•  Section 4.3, Define Distribution Channels: Distribution channels should 
be redefined based on identified communication items and the needs of 
diferent Stakeholder groups. The OCM Practitioner may consider adding 
a dimension to this table by identifying the distribution channels for 
diferent audiences. 
•   Section 4.4, Define Communication Register: The OCM Practitioner 
should review the communication items, target audiences, and frequency 
to make adjustments based on Stakeholder feedback and the project 
timeline. Ofentimes, as an implementation moves closer to go-live, the 
frequency of communications increases in order to keep target audiences 
informed about milestones and progress. 
•   Feedback Channels Amendment: The Feedback Channels Amendment 
should be revised based on the Stakeholder Communication 
Questionnaire results and the quantity and quality of feedback received 
through identified feedback channels. The OCM Practitioner may see the 
need to add, remove, or modify feedback opportunities.

the  results  of  the  Stakeholder  Communication  Questionnaire,  Stakeholder 
Management process updates, and the system development lifecycle. 
In  addition  to  updating  the  Communication  Management  Plan  at  the  onset 
of  the  Executing  Process  Phase,  the  OCM  Practitioner  should  treat  the 
Communication Management Plan as a living document, and therefore, revisit 
its  contents  periodically  through  the  project.  One  tool  that  may  be  used  in 
assessing the efectiveness of the Communication Management Plan and project 
communications is the Communication Feedback Survey. This tool is composed 
of three sections, including an assessment of communication vehicles (or tools), 
project  communication  progress,  and  additional  communication  feedback. 
The  Communication  Feedback  Survey  utilizes  rating  scales  and  open-ended 
questions to capture all Stakeholder feedback. The OCM Practitioner conducts 
this survey in a similar manner to the Stakeholder Communication Assessment, 
by identifying a representative sample of diverse Stakeholders and analyzing 
their feedback. 
By  assessing  the  Communication  Feedback  Survey,  the  OCM  Practitioner 
will be able to adjust the communication process to best meet the needs of 
Stakeholders.  For  example,  the  survey  allows  Stakeholders  to  judge  the 
timeliness, efectiveness, length, and relevance of all communication vehicles. 
If the OCM Practitioner recognizes that a certain communication vehicle, such 
as  a  newsletter,  is  not  efective  or  relevant  to  multiple  Stakeholder  groups, 
the  OCM  Practitioner  may  revamp  the  newsletter  or  switch  to  a  diferent 
communication vehicle. All communication changes should be discussed with 
the  Project  Manager  and  should  align  with  the  information  provided  in  the 
Communication Management Plan. 
Deliver Project Communications 
Once the Communication Management Plan has been reviewed and updated, 
communication  messages  will  be  disseminated  and  collected  based  on 
the  information  set  forth  in  this  plan.  The  OCM  Practitioner  ofen  does  not 
communicate the messages; however, the OCM Practitioner plays an important 
role  in  supporting  and  monitoring  communication  eforts.  One  responsibility 
the  OCM  Practitioner  may  take  on  during  the  communication  process  is  the 
collection, analysis, and reporting of communication feedback outside of formal 
questionnaires and surveys. For more on the feedback process, review the OCM 
Lifecycle Management section of the Planning Process Phase chapter.

the right time, by the right delivery channels. In order to record Communication 
Knowledge Area actions, such as communication dissemination and feedback 
collection,  the  OCM  Practitioner  may  utilize  the  Communication  Action  Log. 
This living document, initially developed in the Planning Process Phase, serves 
to track all communication actions.
