Matrix F is chosen to compute the inter-story drift for each floor:
The feedback control gain used to define the control strategy is
computed using the LQR method and is given by R as follows:

Here, the control action is defined by the feedback gain u = −Rx to
reduce the effect vibrations on the structure.

ˆz are given by,
ˆx[𝑘 + 1] = A𝑑 ˆx[𝑘] + B𝑑 u[𝑘] + L(z[𝑘] − F𝑑 ˆx[𝑘])
ˆz[𝑘] = F𝑑 ˆx[𝑘],
where A𝑑 , B𝑑 , and F𝑑 are a discrete version of the system in Eq. (1),
L is matrix selected such that the eigenvalues of A𝑑 − LF𝑑 are inside
the unit circle, and ˆx[0] is the initial condition of the estimator.
The difference between what we expect and what we measure is
called a residue r[𝑘]:
𝑟𝑖 [𝑘] = |𝑧𝑖 [𝑘] − ˆ𝑧𝑖 [𝑘] |,
where 𝑧𝑖 refers to the measurement obtained with the 𝑖𝑡ℎ sensor,
and ˆ𝑧𝑖 refers to the estimation of the 𝑖𝑡ℎ output.
When the system is under attack, the residues r are large. To
determine if such difference is large enough to raise an alarm, we
use the non-parametric cumulative sum (CUSUM). Unlike other
tests, the CUSUM considers not only the current residue but also the
historical behavior of the residues. We select this detector because
it outperforms other statistics [92]. For the CUSUM, we define a
new statistic for each sensor 𝑆𝑖 [𝑘], which is given by,
𝑆𝑖 [𝑘 + 1] = max{0, 𝑆𝑖 [𝑘] + 𝑟𝑖 [𝑘] − 𝑏𝑖 },
where 𝑆𝑖 [0] = 0, and 𝑏𝑖 > 0 is selected to prevent that statistic
increases without attack. The parameter is tuned such that, in a
scenario without attack,
E[𝑟𝑖 [𝑘] − 𝑏𝑖 ]  𝜏𝑖 , 𝜏𝑖 > 0.
Commonly, the statistic is reset to zero 𝑆𝑖 [𝑘 + 1] = 0 once an alarm
is raised. However, for illustration purposes, we will not reset the
CUSUM in the results of this section. The selection of the parameter
𝜏𝑖 is a trade-off between the time taken to detect an attack and the
false alarm rate: a large threshold will give us low false alarms, but
then, the time to detect an attack will increase. A block diagram
that summarizes the anomaly detection strategy is presented in Fig.
32.
We study the performance of this defense in the 20-story building
with an ATMD.
One of our unanticipated challenges of using a model-based
anomaly detection in structural control, is that the system generates
false alarms whenever there is an earthquake, as seen in Fig. 33a.
So if a DoS attack is launched during an earthquake, it would be

C DEFENSES
We have seen that attacks against structural control systems can
pose significant damages. Therefore in this section we start the
discussion on potential defenses to attacks against structural control
systems. In particular, we focus on how to detect these attacks.
Taking advantage of the physical model of the system, it is possi-
ble to construct an independent reference monitor that uses existing
or redundant sensor measurements (e.g., place additional vibration
sensors in an independent network) to estimate the sensor mea-
surements ˆ𝑦 and compute a residual 𝑟 = 𝑦𝑎 − ˆ𝑦 comparing how the
system should be behaving with what we measure. This type of
approach has been widely studied in the literature, [37, 92] and we
can adapt these defenses to civil structures.
These detectors can determine if sensors or actuators are under
attack. To detect the attack, the measurements obtained with the
sensors are compared with our expected estimate of the behavior
of the system. When a historical difference between those values is
large, we raise an alert.
It is easier to keep track of anomalies in discrete time [37], there-
fore we use a discrete version of the Luenberger observer to estimate
the system states. The state estimation ˆx and the output estimation

impossible to determine if the alert is the result of an attack or the
earthquake.
To address this problem, we need to measure ground seismic sig-
nals. Fortunately, seismic waves can be recorded with seismographs
and their size or intensity can be estimated using the Moment
magnitude or the Richter scale. Most structural health monitoring
systems include an accelerometer installed in the ground to cap-
ture earthquake signals in real time and trigger the control system.
These accelerometers can be digital seismographs or the same type
of sensors used inside the structure [20].

tack but during an earthquake for a) a detector that does not
consider the earthquake and b) a detector that considers the
earthquake.
With earthquake measurements, we need to select the discretiza-
tion time to ensure that the earthquake is properly sampled. Since
the maximum frequency of an earthquake is 10 𝐻𝑧, we select a
sampling time of 𝑇𝑠 = 0.01 𝑠.
With this new system, the estimator receives a noisy version of
the earthquake instead of the actual signal. For this new detector,
the CUSUM parameters are tuned by generating different earth-
quakes using the Kanai-Tajimi model for each of the one thousand
simulations used to tune the CUSUM.Fig. 33b shows the CUSUM
for this new detector during El Centro earthquake.
We now consider the performance of this attack-detector when
facing a DoS attack during an earthquake, and an FDI attack without
an earthquake. The results of those scenarios are presented in Figs.
34a and 34b, respectively. Our system detects the DoS attack at time
4.78 𝑠 before the ISD ratio reaches 1% (that is, the attack is detected
before they damage the structure). We detect an FDI attack even
faster and well before any damage to the system.
To sum up, model-based anomaly detection algorithms can be
used to detect both, DoS and FDI attacks to structural control sys-
tems; however, we need to measure the earthquake during a DoS
attack (in addition to measuring the control and sensor signals from
all other floors).
