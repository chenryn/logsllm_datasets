INCREASING TRANSPARENCY
Acceptable Ads can beneﬁt both users and publishers. Users are
no longer subjected to annoying and intrusive advertising, while
publishers—who use advertising as the primary means to support
their work—can avoid erecting paywalls or reducing content. How-
ever, our analysis suggests several program areas in need of im-
provement. Namely, the current process lacks full transparency.
Such transparency is essential for this laudable tradeoff between
user desires and economic needs to become reality.
We largely agree with the Acceptable Ads criteria, but recommend
that Eyeo take additional steps to reassure users that the company is
acting in good faith. We recommend the following for improving
the whitelisting process and policies.
Disclose ﬁnancial entanglements. Other than a few isolated exam-
ples, users must guess at which ﬁlters and domains originate from a
paid agreement. Eyeo claims that roughly 90% of those companies
added to the list did not have to pay, however full disclosure of
these statistics would strengthen public trust in the Acceptable Ads
initiative.
Eyeo should clearly identify why certain sites have to pay and
others do not. Eyeo states that whitelisting is free for small and
medium-sized sites, but they do not say how they make this deter-
mination or if this is the only criterion. For instance, Alexa ranks
reddit.com higher than Microsoft’s Bing search; however, the for-
mer has stated they do not pay for their whitelist exceptions, while
the latter does. Further, do all whitelisted ad networks pay Eyeo?
Public disclosure of whitelist agreements is especially impor-
tant when one considers that a single company may own multiple
domains. For instance, both ask.com and about.com are in the
whitelist, and both are owned by the same parent company, IAC.27
Document all whitelist modiﬁcations. Currently, Eyeo notiﬁes
their users of whitelist changes through their online forum. However,
20 Rev. 304 used the message “Added new whitelists.”

26The ﬁlter deﬁnes a set of 43 domains for which the AdSense ﬁlter
will not apply.
27http://iac.com/brands
as we discussed in previous sections, Eyeo does not give all ﬁlters
the chance to be publicly vetted, e.g. kayak.com. It is unclear why
some proposals are included in the forums and others are not.
The inclusion of forum links and a short description for groups of
ﬁlters contained in the whitelist allow users to easily ﬁnd relevant
information. However, ﬁlter groups with nondescript titles, e.g. A3,
are opaque.
Avoid overly general ﬁlters. A single unrestricted (or sitekey) ﬁlter
in the whitelist may apply to any number of domains, making it
impossible for a user to determine the ﬁlter’s full scope. Overly
general ﬁlters obscure whitelist understanding.
Identify whitelisted advertisements. In Google Chrome, the Ad-
block Plus extension logo includes a number indicating the number
of blocked elements on the page. Moreover, a greyed-out logo ap-
pears when the user manually disables Adblock Plus on a page. How-
ever, there is no visible indication as to the number of whitelisted
elements. Conversely, the Firefox version includes a “Blockable
Items” toolbar that displays a list of page objects along with any trig-
gered ﬁlters and the list from where the ﬁlter originates: EasyList,
whitelist, etc. All Adblock Plus versions would beneﬁt from such
functionality by allowing interested users to determine which page
elements were blocked and which ones were allowed (and why).
Practice good whitelist hygiene. The whitelist contains redundant,
obsolete, and malformed ﬁlters. In addition to 35 duplicate ﬁlters,
we observed at least 8 malformed exception ﬁlters, all of which
appear to have been erroneously truncated (in Rev. 326) at a max
length of 4095 characters. Similarly, AdSense for search exceptions
are no longer required for individual domains. A process for retiring
needed ﬁlters should be created and documented; and superﬂuous,
malformed, and outdated ﬁlters should be purged.
9. CONCLUSIONS
This paper provides an analysis of Acceptable Ads: a program
with the goal of changing Internet advertising for the better by allow-
ing non-intrusive ads. Our study shows that the program has grown
aggressively over the last four years. There is a diversity of sites
being whitelisted, but a seeming (and understandable) concentration
of whitelisting on popular sites. Yet, the complexity of the lists and
their interaction with other web systems makes a full understanding
difﬁcult.
To us, the way forward seems clear. Public disclosures of ﬁnan-
cial relationships and more process transparency will foster trust and
allow users to make informed choices about how they use blocking
and ultimately what sites they visit. This community voice is essen-
tial because an open discussion is perhaps the only means of reach-
ing a universally acceptable resolution in the blocking/whitelisting
debate.

APPENDIX
A. FILTER SYNTAX
A ﬁlter is structured like a regular expression with additional
modiﬁers and options for changing action and scope. A blocking
ﬁlter prevents web content from loading or showing, and an excep-
tion ﬁlter overrides blocking ﬁlters to allow content. Options and
modiﬁers adjust the scope of ﬁlters to affect only speciﬁc content or
domains.
Adblock Plus provides documentation for the syntax of ﬁlters on
its website.28 Although Adblock Plus uses regular expressions to
parse ﬁlters, we provide a BNF grammar in Figure 12, which can be
used to understand how ﬁlters are created.
A.1 Blocking Filters
The simplest blocking ﬁlter is hrequesti with just hrequest-matchi.
The hrequest-matchi is made primarily of a regular expression that
deﬁnes the path to be blocked, hregex-URL-pathi. The ﬁlter expres-
sion
1
http :// example . com / ads / advert777 . gif
will block the speciﬁed gif advertisement loaded from the given
address. The use of wildcards can increase the effectiveness of a
single ﬁlter. For convenience, each ﬁlter regular expression has
an implicit wildcard operator at the beginning and end of the ﬁlter
expression. For instance, the ﬁlter expression, /ad-frame/, will
affect any domain and will block all page elements that are requested
from the ad-frame subdirectory.
A ‘|’ can be added at the beginning or end of hregex-URL-pathi
to override the implicit wildcard operators. Additionally, the ‘||’
string appears before a domain to allow subdomains and multiple
protocols, such as http:// and https://. The following ﬁlter
1
|| example . com / ad . jpg |
matches both http://good.example.com/ad.jpg and https://
example.com/ad.jpg, but not https://example.com/ad.jpg.
exe.
Moreover, the ‘ˆ’ character matches any and all separator char-
acters within a URL, and may be placed at the beginning or end of
hregex-URL-pathi. Separator characters appear as “anything but a
letter, a digit, or one of the following: _ - . %.”29 For example,
the ﬁlter

will match http://www.google.com/#q=foo, where the sepa-
rator characters are bolded, but this expression will not match
http://scholar.google.com due to the replacement of www with
scholar.
Request Filters and Options. While a request ﬁlter can consist of
only a regular expression with modiﬁers, the addition of options can
tune the scope of a request ﬁlter. The ‘$’ character is placed after
hrequest-matchi to indicate the start of an option list. An option
list consists of 1 or more hoptionis or hno-neg-optis separated by
a comma. A ‘∼’ character is the negation operator, and it can
be coupled with an hoptioni to apply the inverse. However, there
are some options that cannot be negated: hno-neg-opti. Refer to
Section A.4 for more information on each ﬁlter option.
Element Hiding. Elements refer to text or page areas embedded
into the web page itself through the source code. An element hiding
ﬁlter is required to hide and block these elements. The element
hiding ﬁlter requires at least ‘##’ followed by helem-selectori to
match the target page elements.
119The helem-selectori is most commonly a CSS element selec-
tor,30 however this is not always the case.31 Selectors can name
the element explicitly, as ##.ButtonAd, or just specify the id at-
tribute to hide, ###sideads, which is a more general match. Like
hregex-URL-pathi, selectors may contain regular expressions.
In the current implementation of Adblock Plus, restricting el-
ement hiding ﬁlters to a certain domain requires the use of full
domain names.32 Multiple domains are separated by a comma and
apply to the same selector:
1
mnn . com , streamtuner . me ### adv
A negation operator, ‘∼’, may also be applied to domain names to
create an exception for element hiding ﬁlter.
A.2 Exception Filters
An exception ﬁlter allows the user to view page content that would
otherwise be blocked by one or more blocking ﬁlters. Exception
ﬁlter syntax is very similar to that of blocking ﬁlters. An hexceptioni
can be either a hrequesti or an helement-exceptioni, like blocking
ﬁlters. The main differences are found at the beginning of request
ﬁlters and in the middle of element ﬁlters.
Request Filters. An exception hrequesti ﬁlter takes the form of
‘@@’hrequesti, where ‘@@’ must preﬁx all hrequestis. Refer to Sec-
tion A.1 and the formation of hrequesti for further details. If only
hrequesti appears in the ﬁlter (no options), then the string acts like
a regular expression and matches all requests containing that string.
The following example appears in the whitelist allowing Dou-
bleClick advertisements on references.net:
1
@@ || g . doubleclick . net / pagead / $subdocument
, domain = references . net
The ‘domain’ option speciﬁes the domain for which this ﬁlter ap-
plies, and the ‘subdocument’ option indicates that the DoubleClick
advertisement will be embedded in the ‘references.net’ page.
Element Filters. Element exception ﬁlters allow page elements
to be viewed. An helemhide-excepti is very similar in form to
helem-hidei. However, instead of the string ‘##’ for element hiding,
an helemhide-excepti uses ‘#@#’ to denote that it is an exception.
Refer to Section A.1 for more information on element hiding.
The next example also appears in the whitelist and is an ele-
ment hide exception that allows references.net to show the above
DoubleClick ad example on the page.
1
references . net # @ #. adunit
Without this ﬁlter, a request to DoubleClick is established and the ad
is loaded, but an element hiding ﬁlter hides it from view. The struc-
ture of this ﬁlter includes hpage-domaini ﬁrst, and the element’s
class name, ‘.adunit’, second.
A.3 Sitekey Filters
Sitekey ﬁlters primarily occur as exception ﬁlters with ‘document’
as hoptioni, to allow all advertisements. These ﬁlters cover all sites
that return a valid public key and signature. Section 4.2.3 explains
how sitekeys work.
The syntax for hsitekeyi is an exception hrequesti without a
hrequest-matchi and only specifying ‘sitekey’ and ‘document’ as
hoptionis:
1
@@$sitekey = MFwwDQYJK ... wEAAQ , document
30http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/
31See https://adblockplus.org/en/filters#elemhide for
more details.
32https://adblockplus.org/en/filters#elemhide_domains
The ‘sitekey’ option is given an RSA public key created by a
multi-domain owner, e.g., Sedo. The ﬁlter matches all domains that
have the same public sitekey and return a signature signed with the
private RSA key. The ‘document’ option indicates that the entire
page is permitted to show ads; even allowing third-party requests.
A.4 Filter Options Explained
Filters may include a number of options to further specify their
effects on page elements and scope.33 An overview of these ﬁlters
is presented in the following text.
Some options can be grouped by the speciﬁc type of element
loaded from the request. For instance, ‘script’ limits the ﬁlter
to block (or whitelist for exception ﬁlters) the HTML script tag
that loads external scripts. Other similar options include ‘image’,
‘stylesheet’, ‘object’ (where browser plugins like Flash or Java
handle page content), ‘xmlhttprequest’ (for requests by the XML-
HttpRequest object34), ‘object-subrequest’ (for requests started
by browser plugins), and ‘subdocument’ (for pages that are embed-
ded within the page, usually through HTML frames). The ‘other’
option covers requests that are absent from the previous list.
Additional options specify a broader content selection. The
‘document’ option may only be included in an exception ﬁlter and
disables all blocking ﬁlters on affected domains and requests. Simi-
larly, ‘elemhide’ also only applies to exception ﬁlters and disables
all element-hiding ﬁlters. In contrast, the ‘third-party’ option
limits a ﬁlter only to external requests from a different origin than
the current web page. These and all previous options can be preﬁxed
with ‘∼’ to invert their original meaning.
Further, the ‘domain’ option restricts the ﬁlter to certain domains,
which are separated by commas. To not apply the ﬁlter on a certain
domain, the domain can be preﬁxed with the negation operator. If
the ‘domain’ option is not speciﬁed, the request ﬁlter applies to all
domains.
More options are also included in the ﬁlter syntax. The option
‘match-case’ ensures that the request is matched on a case-sensitive
basis. A ‘collapse’ option will guarantee that the element is hid-
den.35 The ‘collapse’ option can also be negated. A ‘donottrack’
option will send a Do-Not-Track header36 to the web page as long
as there is no matching exception rule with a ‘donottrack’ option
on the same page.
Finally, there are deprecated options that still exist for backwards
compatibility, but their use is discouraged: ‘background’, ‘xbl’,
‘ping’, and ‘dtd’.37

cated.
