This bug is filed to track a suboptimal hot reload experience during a step in
our primary codelab
(https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter/). Other similar bugs
exist for other steps.
This bug tracks step 5, part I (Add an interactive text input field).
Before code:
    import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
    void main() {
      runApp(new FriendlychatApp());
    }
    class FriendlychatApp extends StatelessWidget {
      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return new MaterialApp(
          title: "Friendlychat",
          home: new ChatScreen(),
        );
      }
    }
    class ChatScreen extends StatelessWidget {
      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return new Scaffold(
          appBar: new AppBar(title: new Text("Friendlychat")),
        );
      }
    }
After code:
    import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
    void main() {
      runApp(new FriendlychatApp());
    }
    class FriendlychatApp extends StatelessWidget {
      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return new MaterialApp(
          title: "Friendlychat",
          home: new ChatScreen(),
        );
      }
    }
    class ChatScreen extends StatefulWidget {
      @override
      State createState() => new ChatScreenState();
    }
    class ChatScreenState extends State {
      final TextEditingController _textController = new TextEditingController();
      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return new Scaffold(
          appBar: new AppBar(title: new Text("Friendlychat")),
          body: _buildTextComposer(),
        );
      }
      Widget _buildTextComposer() {
        return new Container(
          margin: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 8.0),
          child: new TextField(
            controller: _textController,
            onSubmitted: _handleSubmitted,
            decoration: new InputDecoration.collapsed(hintText: "Send a message"),
          ),
        );
      }
      void _handleSubmitted(String text) {
        _textController.clear();
      }
    }
Result:
    Reloaded 1 of 470 libraries in 372ms.

    Some program elements were changed during reload but did not run when the view was reassembled;
    you may need to restart the app for the changes to have an effect.
