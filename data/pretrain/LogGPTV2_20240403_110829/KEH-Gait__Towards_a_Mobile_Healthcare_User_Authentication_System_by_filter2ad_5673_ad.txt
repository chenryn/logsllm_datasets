done in a real-life situation as gait cannot be hidden. Every
attacker made 5 active imposter attempts. The authentication
accuracy is evaluated by FPR and FNR. In general, FPR relates
to the security of the system, while FNR to the usability.
An interesting point in the Decision Error Trade-off (DET)
curve is the Equal Error Rate (EER) where FPR=FNR. For
instance, an EER of 5% means that out of 100 genuine trials
5 is incorrectly rejected, and out of 100 imposter trials 5 are
wrongfully accepted. We set k = 5 and vary the conﬁdence
threshold C to plot DET curve in Figure 13.
The results on two dataasets are plotted in Figure 13(e)
and Figure 13(f) respectively. The red dash line stands for the
possible points where FPR is equal to FNR. The crossover
(marked as a diamond) of the red dash line and FPR-FNR
curve stands for the location of the EER. We notice that
EER of KEH-Gait is 8.4% and 14.1% on the two datasets
respectively, which means out of 100 passive imposter trials 8
are wrongfully accepted by using PEH and 14 are wrongfully
accepted by using EEH. We also ﬁnd that an imposter does
beneﬁt from mimicking the genuine user’s walking style. The
EER increases to 13.3% and 17.1% on the two datasets
respectively. For the accelerometer-based system, the EER of
a passive attacker and an active attacker are 6.8% and 11.6%,
respectively. The results indicate that the PEH-based system
can achieve comparable EER compared to the accelerometer-
based system. The individual nature of walking gait provides
our scheme security against impersonation attackers and the
evaluation results are encouraging. The false negatives occur
when the gait patterns of the imposter and user are close. This
problem could be dealt with by using two factor authentication.
VII. ENERGY CONSUMPTION PROFILE
Battery lifetime is widely regarded as the major barrier of
achieving long term human-centric sensing. Reducing system
energy consumption has attracted tremendous research efforts
in both academics and industries. In this section, we will
conduct an extensive energy consumption proﬁling of state-
of-the-art wearable systems.
The energy consumption of our system consists of three
parts: sensor sampling, memory reading/writing, and data
transmission. We ﬁnd that memory reading/writing consumes
signiﬁcant less energy compared to the other two parts. A
recent study [34] also investigates the energy consumption of
different Random Access Memory (RAM) technologies, and
their ﬁndings support our measurement results. According to
their measurement, it only consumes 203pJ to write to (or
read from) Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) which is
used in SensorTag. That means if we collect 5s gait data at
40Hz, it only takes 5 × 40 × 203 =40.6nJ to read or write
data. Compared to the energy consumption of other parts, the
energy consumed by SRAM is negligible. Therefore, we only
consider the energy consumption of sensor sampling and data
transmission in our evaluation.
A. Measurement Setup
The Texas Instrument SensorTag is selected as the target
device, which is embedded with the ultra-low power ARM
Cortex-M3 MCU that is widely used by today’s mainstream
wearable devices such as FitBit. The SensorTag is running
with the Contiki 3.0 operating system. The experiment setup
for the power measurement is shown in Figure 14(a). In order
to capture both the average current and the time requirement
for each sampling event, the Agilent DSO3202A oscilloscope
is used. As shown in the ﬁgure, we connect the SensorTag
with a 10Ω resistor in series and power it using a 3V coin
battery. The oscilloscope probe is then connected across the
resistor to measure the current going through.
B. Energy Consumption of Sensor Sampling
1) Power Consumption of Sampling Accelerometer: The
SensorTag includes 9-axis digital MPU9250 motion sensor
combining gyroscope, digital compass, and accelerometer.
During the power measurements, we only enable the 3-axis
accelerometer and leave all the other sensors turned off. The
acceleration signal is sampled using the Inter-Integrated Circuit
(I2C) bus with a sampling frequency of 25Hz. Note that,
it is also possible for the wearable devices to use analog
accelerometers, which can be sampled through analog-to-
digital converter (ADC) instead of I2C bus. Sampling analog
accelerometers could avoid power consumption and additional
time requirement due to the I2C bus, but at the expense of
some processing costs in analog to digital converting. While
it is not immediately obvious whether analog accelerometer

sampling would be less or more power consuming relative
to the digital counterpart, a detailed measurement study [35]
indicates that digital accelerometer is more power efﬁcient than
the comparable analog ones from the same manufacturers.

Figure 14(b) shows the details of accelerometer sampling
energy proﬁle. As shown, each accelerometer sampling event
can be divided into six states. At the beginning of each event,
the MCU is waked up by the software interrupt from the
power-saving deep-sleep mode (S sleep), and it boots the
accelerometer (S1) before going back to sleep. During S2,
the accelerometer starts to power up while the MCU is in
sleep mode. Then, after one software clock tick (7.8 ms in
Contiki OS), the MCU wakes up again by the interrupt to
initialize the accelerometer (S3) and then goes back to sleep.
The accelerometer starts initializing in S4 and turning on in
S5. Finally, MCU wakes up in S6 to sample the acceleration
signal and then goes back to deep-sleep again. The average
power consumption and time requirement for each state are
shown in Table I.
2) Power Consumption of Sampling KEH: In this subsec-
tion, we investigate the power consumption in sampling the
voltage signal of the power source. During the measurement,
MCU is programmed to periodically sample the voltage of
the lithium coin battery with 25Hz sampling rate. The MCU
reads voltage signal through ADC. Figure 14(c) shows the
details of voltage sampling. Similar to the accelerometer, the
MCU goes back to deep-sleep mode after each sampling event.
However, sampling the voltage takes only 0.6ms, which is
much shorter than the 17.2ms required by the accelerometer
sampling. This is because the MCU can read the voltage
signal directly without having to prepare the hardware to be
powered-up, and the voltage signal to be prepared by the power
source. The details of power consumption and time duration
for voltage sampling event are shown in Table II.

3) Energy Consumption Comparison: We now compare
the energy consumption of sampling accelerometer and KEH.
In general, for the duty-cycled gait-recognition system, the
average power consumption in data sampling, Psense, can be

obtained by the following equation:

where, Psample is the average power consumption in the
sampling event (either sampling acceleration or KEH sig-
nal), and Psleep is the average power consumption when
the MCU is in deep-sleep mode (with all the other system
components power-off). n is the sampling frequency, and TS
is the duration of time (in milli-second) spent in a single
sampling event. Based on the measurement results given in
Table I and Table II, we can obtain the average power
consumption for the accelerometer sampling event equals to
322µW with a time requirement of 17.2ms, and 480µW with
a duration of 0.6ms for the KEH sampling event. Then,
based on Equation 7, we get the power consumption in data
sampling for both accelerometer-based and KEH-based gait-
recognition systems with different sampling frequencies. The
results are compared in Figure 15. It
is clear to see that
the proposed KEH-Gait achieves signiﬁcant power saving in
data sampling, comparing with the conventional accelerometer-
based gait-recognition system. More speciﬁcally, given the
analysis shown in Figure 11(a), a sampling rate higher than
40Hz is needed to achieve high recognition accuracy. With
a 40Hz sampling frequency, in case of data sampling, KEH-
Gait consumes 17.38µW, while the power consumption of
accelerometer-based system is 230.74µW.
As can be seen from Figure 11(c), to achieve the same
recognition accuracy, it needs to collect 3 gait cycles for the
accelerometer-based system and 5 gait cycles for the KEH-
based system. If we assume one gait cycle takes 1s (the average
time of one gait cycle is between 0.8s-1.2s), this results in
86.9µJ and 692.22µJ energy consumption in data sampling

C. Energy Consumption of Data Transmission
Next, we evaluate the energy consumption of transmit-
ting acceleration and KEH voltage data via Bluetooth. We
conduct power measurement of the Bluetooth Low Energy
(BLE) beacon using the embedded CC2650 wireless MCU
in the SensorTag. With the 40Hz sampling rate and 75%
compression rate, KEH-Gait generates 200 voltage samples
every ﬁve seconds. This results in 300 bytes data to be
transmitted in total (2 bytes for each of the 12-bits ADC
voltage reading). This consumes an average power of 2.72mW
with a transmission time of 52ms, which results in 106.08µJ of
energy consumption. On the other hand, as 3-axis acceleration
data is collected for 3s, it results in 540 bytes of data and the
energy consumption of transmitting those data is 190.94µJ.
D. Total Energy Saving Analysis
After obtaining the energy consumption of sensor sampling
and data transmission, we investigate the potential of KEH-
Gait for energy saving. Based on the measured results, the
energy consumption of KEH-Gait to complete one authentica-
tion is approximately 192.98µJ, which has reduced the energy
consumption of the accelerometer-based system (883.16µJ) by
78.15%.
A recent study [35] tested the power consumption of six
most commonly available accelerometers, and they found that
when the sampling rate is 50 Hz, the mean power consumption
of these accelerometers is 1542µW, and the minimum power
consumption is 518µW. These accelerometers consume more
power than the one used in our experiments. These results
indicate that KEH-Gait is still superior to most commonly
used accelerometers in terms of energy savings. On the other
hand, the power consumption of accelerometers can be further
reduced by use of data buffers. For example, ADXL345 can
store 32 samples automatically without waking up the CPU.
However, similar optimisation technique can also be integrated
in the KEH-based system to reduce the system level energy
consumption. In this way, the energy consumption of both
accelerometer-based system and KEH-based system will be
reduced. We defer the design optimization of buffer-enabled
KEH-Gait to our future work.
VIII. DISCUSSION
A. PEH v.s. EEH
In this study, we analyze the feasibility of using power
signal generated from energy harvester for gait recognition
13
purpose. Speciﬁcally, we focus on two types of kinetic en-
ergy harvester: PEH and EEH. Our study demonstrates the
harvested power signal caused by human gait motions can be
used to identify different individuals. Table III summarizes a
comparison between the PEH and EEH devices we used in
this paper.
The ﬁrst observation we can have is that the PEH we
used achieves higher recognition accuracy and generates more
energy than EEH when the user is holding the device in the
hand and walk normally. The results can be explained by our
observation that the EEH contains a heavy magnet which is
not sensitive to weak vibrations and motions (compared in
Figure 4(c) and 4(e)). This results in a roughly 10% difference
in the recognition accuracy.
In addition to the system performance, another important
characteristic in designing a wearable device is the form factor
and weight. In case of the PEH device, we built it upon the
Volture V25W PEH energy harvester with a 4.6cm × 3.3cm
× 0.1cm form factor. And it can be further reduced to 2.2cm
× 0.4cm × 0.1cm by exploiting smaller harvester produces
such as the PPA-1022. On the other hand, the EEH device
requires large mass displacement to ensure the free movement
of magnet which makes it difﬁcult to reduce the form factor.
Moreover, in order to generate more power from the PEH
device, a 20 grams tip mass is attached to the PEH device
and results in an overall weight of 23.5 grams. Fortunately,
with current advancement in PEH design, the overall weight
of the PEH can be reduced to less than 10 grams without
signiﬁcantly sacriﬁcing the output power. In comparison, the
EEH device includes a heavy magnet and results in a weight
approximately 65 grams in total. Given the above facts, we
believe that PEH is more convenient to be embedded in future
