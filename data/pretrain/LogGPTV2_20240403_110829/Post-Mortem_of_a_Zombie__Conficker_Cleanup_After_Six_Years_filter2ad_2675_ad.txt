### Countries with High ICT Development and Piracy Rates

Countries with high ICT development (one standard deviation above the mean) and high piracy rates (one standard deviation above the mean) exhibit a peak Conﬁcker infection rate 5.5 times higher than countries with low piracy rates (one standard deviation below the mean). The R² value for this regression is 0.78, indicating that ICT development and piracy rates explain a significant portion of the variation in Conﬁcker peak height.

### Correlating Decay Rates

Although decay rates are less dispersed than peak heights, there are still noticeable differences among countries. Given the relatively slow cleanup rates—where the median of 0.009 translates to a 37% decrease in the number of bots after one year—one hypothesis is that some of the cleanup may be driven by users upgrading their operating systems (e.g., to Windows 7) or replacing old computers with new ones.

For each country, we estimated the decay rate of the market share of Windows XP and Vista from January 2011 to June 2013 using StatCounter GlobalStats data. Figure 11 illustrates these decay rates compared to Conﬁcker decay rates. There is a weak correlation between the two, with a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.26.

Interestingly, in many countries, the Conﬁcker botnet shrank at a slower pace than the market share of Windows XP/Vista (countries below and to the right of the dashed line in Figure 11). This suggests that users infected with Conﬁcker are less likely to upgrade their computers compared to the average consumer. This difference may be more pronounced in countries with a higher level of ICT development, as observed in the graph.

### Discussion

We found that large-scale national anti-botnet initiatives had no observable impact on the growth, peak height, or decay of the Conﬁcker botnet. This is surprising and unfortunate, as one would expect Conﬁcker bots to be targeted for cleanup by such initiatives. We confirmed that the majority of bots were located within ISP networks and observed that some machines had multiple infections.

Turning to institutional factors, we found that the ICT development index and piracy rates can explain 78% of the variation in peak height, even after adjusting for OS market shares. Additionally, the Conﬁcker cleanup rate is lower than the average PC upgrade rate.

Perhaps not all security experts are surprised by these findings, but they are crucial for developing effective anti-botnet policies. When we presented our research to industry practitioners involved in botnet cleanup, two North American ISPs commented that they informed their customers about Conﬁcker infections as part of their own policies, not as part of a country-level initiative. They noted that some customers repeatedly ignored notifications, while others got re-infected soon after cleanup. Another challenge was licensing issues, which required ISPs to direct users to various cleanup tool websites instead of distributing a single tool, complicating the process for some users. Interestingly, both ISPs ranked well in terms of Conﬁcker peak, indicating that their efforts did have a positive impact. Their challenges highlight areas for improvement.

### Future Work

Future work in this area can be pursued in several directions. One is to test various parameters against other independent variables, such as the number of CERTs, privacy regulations, and other governance indicators. A second avenue is to explore Conﬁcker infection rates at the ISP level versus the country level. A random effects regression could reveal the extent to which ISPs in the same country follow similar patterns and whether particular ISPs differ significantly from their country's baseline. Third, it might be fruitful to conduct a qualitative survey of users still infected with Conﬁcker to understand why they remain unaware or unconcerned about running infected machines. This can help develop new mitigation strategies for the most vulnerable populations. Finally, broader research should focus on the challenges identified by ISPs, such as notification mechanisms and simplifying cleanup processes.

### Conclusion and Policy Implications

In this paper, we examined the often-ignored aspect of botnet mitigation: large-scale cleanup efforts. We explored the impact of national anti-botnet initiatives involving ISPs. Did these initiatives accelerate cleanup?

The longitudinal data from the Conﬁcker botnet provided a unique opportunity to investigate this question. We proposed a systematic approach to transform noisy sinkhole data into comparative infection metrics and normalized estimates of cleanup rates. After removing outliers and using hourly Conﬁcker IP address counts per subscriber to account for measurement issues, we modeled the infection trends using a two-part model. This allowed us to condense the dataset into three key parameters for each country and compare the growth, peak, and decay of Conﬁcker across countries.

Our main findings indicate that institutional factors, such as ICT development and unlicensed software use, have influenced the spread and cleanup of Conﬁcker more than large-scale anti-botnet initiatives. Cleanup appears to be even slower than the replacement of machines running Windows XP, suggesting that infected users are outside the reach of current remediation practices. At first glance, these findings seem discouraging. The Conﬁcker Working Group, a collective effort against botnets, had noted remediation as their largest failure. Our findings suggest that the most promising emerging practice to overcome this failure faces similar challenges.

So, what can be done? Our findings lead to several implications. First, the strong correlation between peak infection levels and ICT development and software piracy suggests that botnet mitigation can go hand in hand with economic development and capacity building. Helping countries develop their ICT capabilities can reduce the global impact of infections over the long term. Additionally, the strong correlation with software piracy suggests that automatic updates and unattended cleanups are powerful tools. Policies should enable security updates to install by default and deliver them to all machines, including those running unlicensed copies.

Second, the presence of long-lived bots in a reliable dataset suggests that future anti-botnet initiatives need to commit ISPs to take action on such data sources, even if the sinkholed botnet is no longer a direct threat. These machines are vulnerable and likely to harbor other threats. Tracking these infections will be an important way to measure ISP compliance and incentivize cleanup for users outside the reach of automated tools.

Third, given that cleanup is a long-term effort, future anti-botnet initiatives should support and perhaps fund the long-term sustainability of sinkholes. This is necessary if we want ISPs to act on this data.

A long-term view is rare in cybersecurity, which tends to focus on recent advances and threats. Unlike C&C takedown, bot remediation requires a marathon mindset, not a sprinter's. On a more optimistic note, Finland has been in the marathon for a longer time than most other countries and has consistently enjoyed low infection rates. In other words, a long-term view is not only needed but also possible.
