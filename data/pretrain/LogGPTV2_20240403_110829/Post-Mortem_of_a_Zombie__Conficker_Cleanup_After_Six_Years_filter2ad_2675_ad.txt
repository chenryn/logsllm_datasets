countries with high ICT development (one sd above the
mean), and, similarly, countries with high piracy rates
(one sd above the mean) have an e1.7 = 5.5 times higher
peak than countries with low piracy rates (one sd below
the mean). The R2 of this regression is 0.78, which indi-
cates that ICT development and piracy rates explain most
of the variation in Conﬁcker peak height.
Correlating Decay Rate
Although decay rates are less dispersed than peak
heights,
there are still noticeable differences among
countries. Given the rather slow cleanup rates — the me-
dian of 0.009 translates to a 37% decrease in the number
of bots after one year — one hypothesis that comes to
mind is that perhaps some of the cleanup is being driven
by users upgrading their OS’s (to say Windows 7), or
buying a new computer and disposing of the old fully.
For each country we estimated the decay rate of the
market share of Windows XP and Vista from January
2011 to June 2013 using the StatCounter GlobalStats
data. Figure 11 shows these decay rates versus Conﬁcker
decay rates. There is a weak correlation among the two,
with a Spearman correlation coefﬁcient of 0.26.
But more interesting and somewhat surprising is that
in many countries,
the Conﬁcker botnet shrank at a
slower pace than the market share of Windows XP / Vista
(all countries below and to the right of the dashed line).
Basically this means that the users infected with Con-
ﬁcker are less likely to upgrade their computers then the
average consumer.7
6 Discussion
We found that the large scale national anti-botnet ini-
tiatives had no observable impact on the growth, peak
height, or decay of the Conﬁcker botnet. This is sur-
prising and unfortunate, as one would expect Conﬁcker
bots to be among those targeted for cleanup by such ini-
tiatives. We checked that the majority of bots were in-
deed located among the networks of ISPs, and also ob-
served that some of these machines have multiple infec-
tions. Turning away from the initiatives and to institu-
tional factors that could explain the differences among
7This difference between users who remain infected with Conﬁcker
and the average user might be more extreme in countries with a higher
level of ICT development. This can be observed in the graph.

countries, we observed that the ICT development index
and piracy rates can explain 78% of the variation in peak
height, even after correcting for OS market shares. We
also found that the Conﬁcker cleanup rate is less than the
average PC upgrade rate.
Perhaps not all security experts are surprised by these
ﬁndings. They are nevertheless important in forming ef-
fective anti-botnet policies. We presented the research
to an audience of industry practitioners active in botnet
cleanup. Two North American ISPs commented that they
informed their customers about Conﬁcker infections —
as part of the ISP’s own policy, not a country-level ini-
tiative. They stated that some customers repeatedly ig-
nored notiﬁcations, while others got re-infected soon af-
ter cleanup. Another difﬁculty was licensing issues re-
quiring ISPs to point users to a variety of cleanup tool
websites (e.g., on microsoft.com) instead of directly dis-
tributing a tool, which complicates the process for some
users. Interestingly enough both ISPs ranked well with
regards to Conﬁcker peak, showing that their efforts did
have a positive impact. Their challenges suggests areas
for improvement.
Future work in this area can be taken in several direc-
tions. One is to test the various parameters against other
independent variables — e.g., the number of CERTs, pri-
vacy regulation, and other governance indicators. A sec-
ond avenue is to explore Conﬁcker infection rates at the
ISP level versus the country level. A random effects re-
gression could reveal to what extent ISPs in the same
country follow similar patterns. We might see whether
particular ISPs differ widely from their country baseline,
which would be interesting from an anti-botnet perspec-
tive. Third, it might be fruitful to contact a number of

users still infected with Conﬁcker in a qualitative sur-
vey, to see why they remain unaware or unworried about
running infected machines. This can help develop new
mitigation strategies for the most vulnerable part of the
population. Perhaps some infections are forgotten em-
bedded systems, not end users. Forth and more broadly
is to conduct research on the challenges identiﬁed by the
ISPs: notiﬁcation mechanisms and simplifying cleanup.
7 Conclusion and Policy Implications
In this paper, we tackled the often ignored side of bot-
net mitigation: large-scale cleanup efforts. We explored
the impact of the emerging best practice of setting up
national anti-botnet initiatives with ISPs. Did these ini-
tiatives accelerate cleanup?
The longitudinal data from the Conﬁcker botnet pro-
vided us with a unique opportunity to explore this ques-
tion. We proposed a systematic approach to transform
noisy sinkhole data into comparative infection metrics
and normalized estimates of cleanup rates. After re-
moving outliers, and by using the hourly Conﬁcker IP
address count per subscriber to compensate for a vari-
ety of known measurement issues, we modeled the in-
fection trends using a two-part model. We thereby con-
densed the dataset to three key parameters for each coun-
try, and compared the growth, peak, and decay of Con-
ﬁcker, which we compared across countries.
The main ﬁndings were that institutional factors such
as ICT development and unlicensed software use have in-
ﬂuenced the spread and cleanup of Conﬁcker more than
the leading large scale anti-botnet initiatives. Cleanup
seems even slower than the replacement of machines run-
ning Windows XP, and thus infected users appear out-
side the reach of remediation practices. At ﬁrst glance,
these ﬁndings seem rather gloomy. The Conﬁcker Work-
ing Group, a collective effort against botnets, had noted
remediation to be their largest failure [7]. We have now
found that the most promising emerging practice to over-
come that failure suffers similar problems.
So what can be done? Our ﬁndings lead us to identify
several implications. First of all, the fact that peak infec-
tion levels strongly correlate with ICT development and
software piracy, suggests that botnet mitigation can go
hand in hand with economic development and capacity
building. Helping countries develop their ICT capabil-
ities can lower the global impact of infections over the
long run. In addition, the strong correlation with soft-
ware piracy suggests that automatic updates and unat-
tended cleanups are some of the strongest tools in our
arsenal. It support policies to enable security updates to
install by default, and delivering them to all machines,
including those running unlicensed copies [3]. Some of
these points were also echoed by the ISPs mentioned in
section 6.
Second, the fact that long-living bots appear in a re-
liable dataset — that is, one with few false positives —
suggests that future anti-botnet initiatives need to com-
mit ISPs to take action on such data sources, even if the
sinkholed botnet is no longer a direct threat. These ma-
chines are vulnerable and likely to harbor other threats as
well. Tracking these infections will be an important way
to measure ISP compliance with these commitments, as
well as incentivize cleanup for those users outside the
reach of automated cleanup tools.
Third, given that cleanup is a long term effort, future
anti-botnet initiatives should support, and perhaps fund,
the long-term sustainability of sinkholes. This is a neces-
sity if we want ISPs to act on this data.
A long term view is rare in the area of cybersecurity,
which tends to focus on the most recent advances and
threats. In contrast to C&C takedown, bot remediation
needs the mindset of a marathon runner, not a sprinter.
To conclude on a more optimistic note, Finland has been
in the marathon for a longer time than basically all other
countries. It pays off: they have been enjoying consis-
tently low infection rates for years now. In other words,
a long term view is not only needed, but possible.

Appendix - Individual Country Graphs
In this appendix we provide the model ﬁt for all the 62
countries used in the paper. The graphs show the relative
number of Conﬁcker bots in each country - as measured
by average unique Conﬁcker IP addresses per hour in the
sinkholes, divided by broadband subscriber counts for
each country. (Please refer to the methodology section
for the rationale). In each graph, the solid line (in blue)
indicates the measurement; the dotted line (in gray) is
removed outliers; and the smooth-solid line (in red) in-
dicates the ﬁtted model. The model has four parameters:
growth and decay rates — given on the graph — and
height and time of peak infections — deducible from the
axes. The R2 is also given for each country.
