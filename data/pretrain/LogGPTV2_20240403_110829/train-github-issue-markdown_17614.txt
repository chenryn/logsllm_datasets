Please add support for custom non-standard DOM events, ideally through a
public API but if that's a "no go" at least some way that would not require
forking the code base.
Here is my attempt of exposing non-standard events after getting some insights
on IRC, unfortunately it still does not work (as event listeners are not
registered) and I am not sure if there is more whitelists somewhere that skips
those custom events:

P.S.: Any help in changing this snippet to make it work is also greatly
appreciated
