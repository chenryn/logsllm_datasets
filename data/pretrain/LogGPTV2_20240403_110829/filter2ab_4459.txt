title:blackhat:eu-20 This is for the Pwners : Exploiting a WebKit 0-day in PlayStation 4
Despite an active console hacking community, only few public PlayStation 4 exploits have been released. The exposed WebKit-based browser is usually the entrypoint of a fullchain attack: from browser exploitation to kernel exploitation. However, browser-engine hardening techniques together with the total absence of debugging capabilities make it very hard to successfully exploit bugs in the latest PS4 firmwares. In this talk, we will present how we managed to debug then exploit a 0-day WebKit vulnerability on 6.xx firmwares. The bug has been reported by our fuzzers and is currently under the process of responsible disclosure.The bug is a Use-after-Free (UAF) vulnerability in WebKit engine. The exploitation of this bug requires a deep understanding of WebKit's primary heap allocator. The key concepts of the allocator as well as the primitives required to massage the heap will be introduced to the audience.In this talk, we will introduce the root cause of the bug. This bug provides limited exploitation primitives. However, thanks to a weakness we identified in ASLR mechanism, we were able to make this bug exploitable. In this presentation, we will focus on the exploitation strategy we adopted to get code execution in the context of the browser process and how we turned in particular a Use-After-Free into a R/W primitive leading to code execution. We will conclude our talk by outlining some of the hurdles we faced while attempting to port the exploit on the latest PS4 firmware.
