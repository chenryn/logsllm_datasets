### Title: blackhat:eu-20 - For the Pwners: Exploiting a WebKit 0-Day in PlayStation 4

Despite the active console hacking community, only a few public PlayStation 4 (PS4) exploits have been released. The WebKit-based browser, often the entry point for full-chain attacks, has become increasingly challenging to exploit due to browser-engine hardening and the lack of debugging capabilities. In this talk, we will present our process of debugging and exploiting a 0-day WebKit vulnerability on PS4 firmware versions 6.xx. This bug was identified by our fuzzers and is currently under responsible disclosure.

The vulnerability is a Use-after-Free (UAF) in the WebKit engine. Successfully exploiting this bug requires a deep understanding of WebKit's primary heap allocator. We will introduce the key concepts of the allocator and the techniques needed to manipulate the heap effectively.

During the presentation, we will detail the root cause of the UAF and the limited exploitation primitives it initially provides. However, by identifying a weakness in the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) mechanism, we were able to make the bug exploitable. Our focus will be on the exploitation strategy we adopted to achieve code execution within the context of the browser process. Specifically, we will explain how we transformed the UAF into a Read/Write primitive, leading to successful code execution.

We will conclude the talk by discussing the challenges we faced while attempting to port the exploit to the latest PS4 firmware, highlighting the ongoing difficulties in this area.
