**Title: EU-22 Fail Harder: Uncovering Critical 0-Days Despite Ourselves**

Vulnerability researchers and bug hunters often highlight their triumphant journeys to discovering critical vulnerabilities. However, the real story is rarely as straightforward or glamorous as it seems on stage. In fact, it's the persistence through failure that often leads to significant breakthroughs. This session will delve into the numerous setbacks and challenges we faced before uncovering critical zero-day vulnerabilities across various projects. 

Join us to learn how to embrace failure and turn it into a stepping stone for success. Two experienced hackers will share their technical missteps and poke fun at each other's mistakes, providing a candid look at the process. We'll also discuss the lucky breaks and moments of ingenuity that ultimately led to our discoveries. By learning from our failures, you can transform your own frustrations into productive progress. (Note: No Prince Charming on a white horse included.)
