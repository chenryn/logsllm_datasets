titleblackhat:eu-22 Fail Harder: Finding Critical 0-Days in Spite of Ourselves
Vulnerability researchers and bug hunters love to talk about their successful path to finding a critical vulnerability. However, this is rarely the Cinderella story people tell on stage. Failure, along with a healthy dose of persistence, can lead to tremendous success. This session will take a deep dive into all the things that didn't work, along with the many challenges that preceded the findings of critical zero-day bugs across multiple projects. Come learn how to fail harder and see two hackers air their technical dirty laundry on stage, while poking fun at each other's mistakes. We will also share the lucky breakthroughs and strokes of genius okay intellect that saved the day for each challenge. Instead of failing harder on your own, learn from our failures to turn your headaches into a dance party. (Prince Charming on a white horse not included.)
