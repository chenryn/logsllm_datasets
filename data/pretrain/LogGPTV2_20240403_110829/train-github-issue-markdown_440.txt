### Current Behavior

When a web component is used within an Angular component, the attributes specified on the web component are not available inside the `attachedCallback` of the web component. Additionally, when an attribute value for a web component is set using Angular's interpolation operator (e.g., `value="{{value}}"`), Angular internally manages the attribute by prefixing it with `ng-reflect-`. This modification prevents the `attributeChangedCallback` from being triggered correctly.

### Expected Behavior

There should be a mechanism to use a web component inside an Angular component such that:
- The attributes are accessible within the `attachedCallback`.
- The `attributeChangedCallback` is properly triggered for the appropriate attributes.
