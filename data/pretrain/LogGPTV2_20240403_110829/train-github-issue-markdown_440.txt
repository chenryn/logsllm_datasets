**Current behavior**
When a web component is used inside an Angular component, attributes specified
on web component are not available inside `attachedCallback` of web component.
Also, when an attribute value for a web component is specified using an
interpolation operator `value="{{value}}"`, Angular changes attribute name
with a `ng-reflect-` prefix and manages it internally. Because of this there
is no way `attributeChangedCallback` could trigger appropriately.
**Expected behavior**
There should be a way to use web component inside Angular component in a way
such that attributes are available inside `attachedCallback` and
`attributeChangedCallback` is triggered correctly for appropriate attributes.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**
This shows a sample Toggle Button web component used inside Angular component.
