Days After Registration
Figure 2: The median social degree for users based on private messages in
a 60-day window surrounding their registration dates.
Because so few buddy links exist, we only consider the private
message (“PM”) and thread (“thread”) link types in our analyses.
4.1 Degree Analysis
Figure 1 shows the degree distributions for the six forums. We
only consider pairs of nodes with reciprocal links. Figure 1(a) shows
that few users exchange private messages on HL, BH, FH and HS,
with less than 40% of users involved in more than one private mes-
sage exchange. Members on CC and LC create more relationships
through private messages, with over 50% of their users linked to
at least one other forum member, and more than 25% of their users
involved in at least 10 conversations. This difference is likely due to
users being more actively engaged in commerce, with many trans-
actions taking place over private messages. The users in all forums
(except for HL, being relatively new) create a comparable number
of links via posting, which makes sense since this is the primary
means of communication in forums. CC and LC exhibit more links,
with over 50% of their users linked to over 20 other members via
public postings (double the amount of other forums).
4.2 Social Network Growth
Figure 2 shows how the median private messaging social degree
changes among forum users in the 60 days following their registra-
tions. We only consider reciprocal links when computing the social
degree. For each pair of linked users, we looked at the difference
between their registration dates and the latest timestamp associated
with their ﬁrst private message exchange. We omit HL and BH due
to the noise present in their curves. For the private messaging so-
cial graph, there is little change in the median social degree after the
ﬁrst week for users on FH and HS. In contrast, for CC and LC, both
sets of users experience growth after the ﬁrst week, again likely due
to the business transactions occurring over PM to a dynamic set of

partners. After the ﬁrst month, the median social degree for the
users on LC and CC is approximately nine, versus two for FH and
HS. The growth rate for the thread social graph (not shown) follows
the same trend across all forums: users undergo the largest growth
in the ﬁrst several weeks. In contrast, however, all forums show
members continuing to interact with new users via public postings.
4.3 User Overlap
To study the population overlap among forum members, Tables
3 and 4 show the percentage of overlapping email addresses and
usernames (respectively) between each pair of forums. Of the six,
only HS did not list any email addresses for its registered members.
LC and FH share over two thousand email addresses, while LC and
CC share 595, roughly 7% of the CC membership. This overlap
is unsurprising, since both forums are geared toward the trading
of stolen credit cards. However, even the newest English-based fo-
rum, HL, shared 6 to 33 email addresses across the German forums.
Though email addresses are likely a more reliable metric for es-
tablishing population overlap, usernames also provide insight into
overlap since users desire unique public identities to maintain their
reputations. All forum pairs contained some number of overlapping
usernames, with the German forums (CC, FH, HS, LC) sharing an
appreciable number of usernames. For example, over 10% of the
usernames on CC are present in all three of the other German fo-
rums. Likewise, over 17% of the usernames on LC appear in both
FH and HS.

4.4 Group Elevation
Users that join a forum are assigned a group, which roughly cor-
responds to their social status on the site. Generally, users start in
the pending authorization group, meaning they must perform some
action (e.g., respond to email conﬁrmation) or undergo some type
of scrutiny before being given access to the forum. Once the user
has jumped through the necessary hoops, they begin in the “new-
bie” group. After some activity, users are generally elevated to a
non-newbie group and advance from there. Figures 3 and 4 show
the median amount of activity that users engaged in prior to tran-
sitioning to higher group levels for CC and FH (BH and HL were
similar to FH). All the forums place a large emphasis on public
postings versus private messaging, indicating that reputation comes
from being publicly active on the forums. Users with greater stand-
ing in the CC forum have the most balanced amount of activity,
posting and private messaging in roughly equal amounts.
4.5 User Interaction Analysis
Figure 5 shows how private message interactions are distributed
among users’ “associates” (i.e., fellow members they are linked
with) on LC, which has the greatest number of PMs. We looked
at these distributions to determine the extent to which users interact
with different individuals. For each user, we compute a distribu-
