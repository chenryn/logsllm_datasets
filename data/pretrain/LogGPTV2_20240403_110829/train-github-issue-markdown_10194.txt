When reloading a page, isolated routes function correctly, but route parameters do not. This issue is related to the following resources:

### Issue Description

I am using the `Router` and `RouteParams` in Angular 2 with Dart. My routes are defined as follows:

```dart
@RouteConfig(const [
  const Route(path: '/', component: ViewLanding, as: 'home'),
  const Route(path: '/landing', component: ViewLanding, as: 'landing'),
  const Route(path: '/flights', component: ViewFlights, as: 'flights'),
  const Route(path: '/picker/:cityDepart/:cityArrival/:dateDepart/:dateArrival/', component: ViewFlights, as: 'picker'),
  const Route(path: '/order/:id/:level/:dateDepart/:dateArrival/', component: ViewOrder, as: 'order'),
  const Route(path: '/order/complete', component: ViewComplete, as: 'orderComplete')
])
```

### Application Entry Point

```dart
void main() {
  print('-- Main.dart 2 --');
  bootstrap(Tickets, [
    routerInjectables,
    client_classes,
    // The base path of your application
    bind(APP_BASE_HREF).toValue('/'),
    // Uncomment this if you want to use '#' in your URL
    bind(LocationStrategy).toClass(HashLocationStrategy)
  ]);
}
```

### Current Behavior

The routing works fine when using `router-outlet`, `router-link`, or `router.navigate`. However, on page reload, routes with parameters do not match correctly.

For example, if I refresh the page at:
```
http://localhost:8080/#/picker/SAN/SFO/2015-01-01/2015-04-02
```
I am redirected to the parent view without any child routes. This behavior is consistent for all routes with parameters.

Navigating directly to or refreshing the following URL works as expected:
```
http://localhost:8080/#/flights/
```
- The `ViewFlights` component is instantiated correctly.

### Symptoms

- Routing with parameters fails on page reload.

### Question

How can I define route configurations to support parameters on page reload?
