If you reload a page, an isolated route will work, but route params will not.

Im using the Router and RouteParams in Angular 2 Dart.
My routes are as follow:
    @RouteConfig(const [
      const Route(path: '/', component: ViewLanding, as: 'home'),
      const Route(path: '/landing', component: ViewLanding, as: 'landing'),
      const Route(path: '/flights', component: ViewFlights, as: 'flights'),
      const Route(path: '/picker/:cityDepart/:cityArrival/:dateDepart/:dateArrival/', component: ViewFlights, as: 'picker'),
      const Route(path: '/order/:id/:level/:dateDepart/:dateArrival/', component: ViewOrder, as: 'order'),
      const Route(path: '/order/complete', component: ViewComplete, as: 'orderComplete')
    ])
// Application Entry Point
    void main() {
      print('-- Main.dart 2 --');
      bootstrap(Tickets, [
        routerInjectables,
        client_classes,
        // The base path of your application
        bind(APP_BASE_HREF).toValue('/'),
        // uncomment this if you want to use '#' in your url
        bind(LocationStrategy).toClass(HashLocationStrategy)
      ]);
    }
This works fine with router-outlet / router-link / router.navigate
However, on page reload - i don't get a positive match for routes with params.
IE: if i refresh http://localhost:8080/#/picker/SAN/SFO/2015-01-01/2015-04-02
\- i goto the parent view with no child routes. This symptom is true for any
route with params.
Navigating directly to or refreshing to: http://localhost:8080/#/flights/ \-
works as expected - the ViewFlights component is instantiated
**Symptoms:**  
routing with params fails.
**Question:**  
How do i define route configurations to work with parameters on refresh
