User: I've installed python 3.5 and python 2.7 on windows. And I've added path for python 2.7 in PATH variable. When I type 'python --version' in windows cmd, it prints 2.7. But when i type 'python --version' in git bush, it prints 3.5.
How to change python version in windows git bash to 2.7?
Assistant: Follow these steps:

Open Git bash, cd ~
Depending on your favorite editortouch, code or vim (in my case) type code .bashrc
Add the line alias python='winpty c:/Python27/python.exe' to the open .bashrc
Save and Close.
Try python --version on git bash again.

Hopefully it works for you.
