To ensure that the Python version in Git Bash on Windows is set to 2.7, follow these steps:

1. **Open Git Bash:**
   - Launch Git Bash from your Start menu or by searching for it.

2. **Navigate to Your Home Directory:**
   - In the Git Bash terminal, type `cd ~` and press Enter. This will change your current directory to your home directory.

3. **Edit the .bashrc File:**
   - Open the `.bashrc` file using a text editor. You can use any text editor you prefer, such as `code`, `vim`, or `nano`. For example, if you are using Visual Studio Code, you can type:
     ```sh
     code ~/.bashrc
     ```
   - If you prefer to use `vim`, you can type:
     ```sh
     vim ~/.bashrc
     ```

4. **Add an Alias for Python:**
   - Add the following line to the `.bashrc` file to create an alias for Python 2.7:
     ```sh
     alias python='winpty C:/Python27/python.exe'
     ```
   - Save the file and close the text editor.

5. **Reload the .bashrc File:**
   - To apply the changes, you need to reload the `.bashrc` file. Type the following command in the Git Bash terminal:
     ```sh
     source ~/.bashrc
     ```

6. **Verify the Python Version:**
   - Finally, check the Python version in Git Bash by typing:
     ```sh
     python --version
     ```
   - It should now display `Python 2.7.x`.

By following these steps, you should be able to set the Python version to 2.7 in Git Bash on Windows.
