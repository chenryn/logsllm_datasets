## Abstract
Recent advancements in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) have enabled power system applications to utilize measurement signals across Wide Area Networks (WANs). The performance of these applications is highly dependent on the quality of data delivery services. However, Quality of Service (QoS) issues such as latency, packet loss, and jitter are inevitable. While there is a trend to incorporate QoS metrics into controller design, ensuring that the application receives data within the designed tolerance range remains a challenge. This paper introduces a novel Stateful Data Delivery Service (SDDS) to address this challenge from the perspective of communication infrastructure. The SDDS continuously monitors QoS performance and identifies suitable data sources for the application. As a proof of concept, a Power Oscillation Damping (POD) controller was integrated with the SDDS, demonstrating improved robustness. The paper also explores the feasibility of applying SDDS to wide area control (WAC) applications.

## 1. Introduction
The power system is a critical component of modern society. In multi-machine interconnected power systems, oscillations naturally occur, and some of these modes can be unstable, leading to potential blackouts. Power Oscillation Damping (POD) controllers can mitigate these issues by using signals rich in inter-area mode content, such as power flow, voltage magnitude, and generator speed. Some of these signals are obtained locally, while others must be transmitted from remote substations over a WAN.

Data transmission over WANs often suffers from QoS issues like latency, packet loss, and jitter, which can degrade the performance of the POD controller. Therefore, it is essential to consider QoS metrics during the design phase of power system applications. Even with QoS-aware designs, ensuring that the delivered data meets the required specifications remains challenging. Several global projects, such as NASPInet and Gridstat, are addressing these challenges, and the work presented in this paper complements these efforts.

### 1.1 Contribution of the Paper
This paper presents ongoing work on a novel Stateful Data Delivery Service (SDDS) for power system applications. The SDDS monitors data link status in real-time and identifies suitable data sources for the application. It also handles necessary data link configurations to compensate for QoS issues. The SDDS simplifies the design of power system applications in two ways:
1. **Not all-in-one:** Not all QoS metric requirements need to be considered in a single application algorithm.
2. **Link failure tolerance:** Multi-candidate signal solutions increase tolerance to link failures.

Additionally, the availability of QoS-guaranteed data enables future design improvements in power system applications.

### 1.2 Outline of the Paper

- **Section III:** Describes the proposed SDDS in detail.
- **Section IV:** Provides the experimental setup, relevant parameters, and results.
- **Section V:** Concludes the paper and outlines future work.

## 2. Related Work
There are two main tracks of related work:
1. **Application Design Considering QoS Requirement:** Research has shown that incorporating QoS requirements into the application design phase can mitigate the effects of QoS performance on control. For example, predictor-based approaches like \( f^+ \) have been used to handle latency in control applications [8]. Adaptive controllers have also been developed to manage varying latencies [5, 9, 10]. However, these approaches still face challenges, such as the need for specific compensators and additional latency detection functions.
2. **QoS Management for Applications:** QoS management can improve the quality of data delivery systems. The NASPInet architecture, for instance, uses a publish-subscribe model to ensure QoS [11]. Similarly, the Gridstat architecture guarantees multicast communication and uses a management plane to set up and manage communication channels [12].

## 3. Stateful Data Delivery Service
This section provides a detailed description of the SDDS, divided into two parts: the overall architecture and the state diagram of the SDDS Provider (SP).

### 3.1 Overall Architecture of Stateful Data Delivery Service
The SDDS architecture, illustrated in Figure 1, includes the following key components:
- **Application Registration:** SP provides an interface for applications to register their data requirements, including input data groups, priorities, and QoS requirements.
- **Data Source Lookup:** SP looks up data sources via an overlay network based on the application's registration information.
- **Data Link Establishment:** SP establishes necessary data links using a publish-subscribe concept.
- **QoS Management:** SP monitors the QoS performance of established data links and handles data sorting, down-sampling, and other tasks.
- **State Awareness Notification to Application:** SP forwards data and data link status to the application and switches to alternative data sources if the QoS performance does not meet the requirements.

### 3.2 State Diagram of SP
Figure 2 illustrates the working processes of the SP. In the initialization state, SP imports parameters such as available local data sources and information about other SPs on the overlay network. It also initializes tables to maintain information about registered applications, QoS requirements, data link status, local data sources, and QoS performance.

After initialization, SP continuously monitors messages from applications and other SPs, expecting the following types of messages:
- **Application Registration Message (ARM):** Contains data source groups, priorities, and QoS requirements.
- **Data Lookup Request (DLR):** Contains a list of data that the sender SP wants to look up.
- **Data Link Establish (DLE) Request:** Specifies the data source the sender SP wants to establish a data link with.

## 4. Experimental Setup and Results
This section provides the experimental setup, relevant parameters, and results. A Power Oscillation Damping (POD) controller was connected to the SDDS to demonstrate its effectiveness. The results show improved robustness of the POD controller when using the SDDS. The feasibility of applying SDDS to WAC applications is also discussed.

## 5. Conclusion and Future Work
The paper concludes by summarizing the contributions of the SDDS and outlining future research directions. The SDDS effectively addresses the challenge of ensuring that power system applications receive data within the designed tolerance range, thereby improving the robustness and reliability of these applications. Future work will focus on further refining the SDDS and exploring its application in other domains.
