Abstract—Recent 
Communication 
Technology  (ICT)  advances  have  enabled  power  system 
applications using measurement signals across the Wide Area 
Network  (WAN).  The  application  control  performance  relies 
on  the  quality  of  data  delivery  service.  However,  the 
characteristics  of  Quality  of  Service  (QoS),  such  as  latency, 
packet loss, and packet jitter, are unavoidable. It is a trend to 
take  QoS  metric  requirement  into  the  consideration  of 
controller design. But, how to ensure the application receiving 
the  data  within  the  designed  tolerant  range  is  another 
challenge.  This  paper  presents  ongoing  work  on  a  novel 
Stateful  Data  Delivery  Service  (SDDS)  for  power  system 
application  to  address  the  challenge  from  the  side  of  the 
communication  infrastructure.  The  SDDS  monitors  the  QoS 
performance on-line and identifies the signals which satisfy the 
requirement for the application to use. As a proof of concept, a 
Power  Oscillation  Damping  (POD)  controller  is  connected  to 
the SDDS. The result shows the improvement in robustness of 
the POD controller by application of the SDDS. The paper also 
shows the feasibility of applying SDDS to WAC applications.

INTRODUCTION
The power system is a crucial part of modern society. In 
multi-machine  interconnected  power  systems,  oscillation 
occurs  naturally  [1].  Some  of  these  oscillation  modes  are 
unstable  and  can  lead  to  blackout  of  power  system  [2]. 
Power  Oscillation  Damping  (POD)  controllers  can  be 
introduced  to  handle  this  issue.  Signals  rich  in  interarea 
mode contents, such as power flow, voltage magnitude, and 
generator speed are candidates of POD controller input [3]. 
Some of these signals can be obtained from local substation 
and the rest need to be transferred from remote substations 
crossing the Wide Area Network (WAN). 
Signals  from  remote  substations  may  suffer  Quality  of 
Service (QoS) problems such as latency, packet loss, packet 
jitter. Such degradation of the communication in many cases 
is  unavoidable.  The  QoS  performance  will  affect  the 
controller  performance  if  the  QoS  metric  is  not  considered 
during the controller design phase. Therefore, there is a trend 
to take QoS metric requirement in the consideration of power 
system application design [4],[5]. Even if the controller has 
been  designed  to  manage  QoS  variations,  it  may  still  be  a 
challenge 
those 
to  enable  data  delivery 
to  meet 
specifications.  There  are  number  of  projects  worldwide 
addressing  this  topic,  e.g  NASPInet,  Gridstat,  (see  Section 
IIError!  Reference  source  not  found.),  and  the  work 
presented  in  this  paper  should  be  seen  as  a  complement  to 
those developments. 
A. Contribution of the Paper 
This  paper  presents  ongoing  work  on  a  novel  Stateful 
Data Delivery Service (SDDS) for power system application 
to address the challenge from the side of the communication 
infrastructure.  The  SDDS,  as  a  mechanism,  is  used  to 
monitor data link status on-line and identify satisfactory data 
sources  for  the  application  to  use.  It  also  takes  the 
responsibility  of  necessary  data 
to 
compensate  for  QoS  issues.  This  service  simplifies  the 
design of power system applications from the following two 
aspects. 1). Not all-in-one: not all QoS metric requirements 
need to be considered in the single application algorithm. 2). 
Link  failure  tolerant:  Link  failure  is  fatal  to  almost  all 
applications.  But  multi-candidate  signals  solution  can 
increase  the  tolerance  to  link  failure.
In  addition,  the 
availability of QoS guaranteed data enables future design of 
power system applications.

feasibility of controller design taking the latency into account 
[4].  Though  considering  the  fixed  latency,  the  controller 
might  deteriorate  to  a  point  when  latency  is  out  of  the 
tolerated  range.  In  order  to  handle  varying  latency,  an 
adaptive controller is introduced by [5]. Based on the latency 
feedback signal, the controller is able to choose appropriate 
compensator  to  control  the  actuator.  Furthermore,  research 
works on latency tolerant controller design can be found in 
[9] and [10]. However,  there are  two  challenges  still.  First, 
the  compensators  are  designed  for  specific  latency  ranges. 
Once  the  latency  is  out  of  the  range  of  all  the  designed 
compensators, 
Second, 
application needs to add additional latency detection function 
in  order  to  select  which  compensator  is  appropriate  to  use. 
The SDDS proposed in this paper aims to solving these two 
challenges,  by  removing 
the  control 
application and integrating it with the data delivery service.

Delivery Service is implemented in a communication node, 
here termed SDDS Provider, or SP for short. For the purpose 
of  this  study,  we  regard  the  SP  as  one  single  dedicated 
device.  For  practical  implementations,  the  functionality  of 
the  SP  may  be  available  in  one  stand-alone  node,  or  be 
implemented across several existing devices in a substation, 
e.g. substation router, switch or IED.  In the text below, we 
have  pointed  out  such  complementing  technologies  and 
concepts that partially each contribute to the functionality of 
an SP. An SP has following functions: 
Application registration: Provide interface for applications to 
register  its  data  requirements  in  the  form  of  required  input 
data  groups, 
the  priority  of  data  groups,  and  QoS 
requirement of these data sources. 
Data  source  lookup:  SP  takes  the  responsibility  to  lookup 
data sources via the overlay network among SPs according to 
requirements in the application registration information.

Besides  designing  a  controller  with  a  large  tolerant 
latency range, QoS management can be another solution to 
increase the quality of the data delivery system. Here quality 
includes  performance,  cyber-security,  interoperability,  and 
reliability  [7].  NASPInet  architecture,  as  one  of  the  most 
prominent  developments  in  the  field,  is  built  around  a 
publish-subscribe concept in which PMU data producers and 
consumers communicate using a shared communication bus 
that  goes  across  organizational  boundaries  in  order  to 
provide  the  QoS  [11].  Similar  to  NASPInet,  Gridstat 
architecture  use  QoS+  concept  that  guarantees  Multicast 
communication.  The  Gridstat  architecture  is  based  on  the 
concept  of  a  management  plane  in  which  meta-level 
communication  attributes  are  communicated  between 
participating  nodes  in  order  to  set  up  communication 
channels  and  manage  changes  in  the  communication  or 
power system configuration [12]. The stateful data delivery 
service  proposed  herein  is  based  on  a  similar  overlay 
architecture  to  Gridstat.  The  SDDS  provides  status  of  the 
data  link  information  to  the  application,  and  manages 
switching to other data sources. This is further described in 
Section III.

STATEFUL DATA DELIVERY SERVICE
This  section  describes  the  SDDS  in  greater  detail.  The 
description  is  separated  into  two  parts.  First,  the  overall 
architecture  of  the  SDDS  is  described.  Thereafter  detailed 
state diagram and interaction diagrams are used to illustrate 
how the SDDS Provider monitors the data links and informs 
the  application  when  QoS  problems  require  an  alternative 
data source. 
A. Overall Architecture of Stateful Data Delivery Service 
The  overall  architecture  of  the  SDDS  is  illustrated  by 
Figure  1.  The  functionality  to  enable  the  Stateful  Data 
Figure 1.  Overall architecture of the stateful data delivery service. 
Data link establishment: SP establishes necessary data links 
according  to  the  priority  order  and  available  data  sources. 
The  data  link  is  established  using  a  publish-subscribe 
concept [6]. 
QoS  management:  This  function 
is  used  for  on-line 
monitoring of  the  QoS performance  of  the established  data 
link.  It  also  takes  responsibilities  for  data  sorting,  down 
sampling, and etc. Here is an obvious complementarity with 
other concepts such as the PhasorGateway [13]. 
State Awareness Notification to Application: SP forwards the 
data  and  data  link  status  to  the  application.  When  the  QoS 
performance  cannot  satisfy 
the 
application, SP switches to an alternative data source which 
fulfills the requirements. 
B. State Diagram of SP  
requirement  of 
the 
The  State  diagram  in  Figure  2  illustrates  the  working 
processes of the SP. In the initialization state, SP imports the 
parameters  such  as  available 
local  data  sources  and 
information  of  other  SPs  on  the  overlay  network.  It  also 
initializes  several  tables  to  maintain  the  information  of 
registered  application,  QoS  requirements,  data  link  status, 
local data source, and QoS performance. 
After initialization, SP keeps monitoring messages from 
application  and/or  other  SPs. It expects  the  following  three 
types of messages: 
x Application Registration Message (ARM): contains data 
source groups ordered according to priority, data source 
name, QoS requirement for each data source.
