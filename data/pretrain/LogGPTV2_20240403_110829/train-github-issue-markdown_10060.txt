First and foremost, I would like to commend you on creating an exceptional framework. It is both visually appealing and highly functional for all my current needs.

However, I have encountered a recurring challenge with the `DatePicker` and `TextField` components. Specifically, when a user wants to reset the value of these controls, I find myself implementing workarounds by adding "x" icon buttons outside the controls. This approach often leads to styling issues, as I need to position the icon next to the control, which can be cumbersome.

It would be incredibly beneficial if there were an option, such as `addCloseButton`, that could be added to these controls. This feature would allow for a quick and easy way to reset the value directly within the component.

For a reference, you can see a good example of this functionality in the `react-select` library (http://jedwatson.github.io/react-select/). Notice how it incorporates an "x" icon for clearing the input.

Thank you for considering this suggestion.
