First of all you guys created an amazing framework. It looks great and it
works great so far for everything I need it for.
But I find myself more and more creating some hacks around DatePicker and
TextField. In case if user wants to reset the value of those controls I need
to put "x" iconButtons outside of controls and then have a headache with
styling to put the icon next to the control.  
It would be amazing if there would be an option for those controls
"addCloseButton" or something like that to the controls for a quick reset of
the value.  
I do not have a prototype per say but a good example would be
http://jedwatson.github.io/react-select/ take a look how it has "x" icon I'm
talking about.
Thanks!
