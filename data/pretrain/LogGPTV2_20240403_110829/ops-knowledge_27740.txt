User: How to use the Git version control system to manage code?
Assistant: 1. Install Git: Install the Git program on the computer, which can be downloaded and installed from the Git official website. 2. Create a warehouse: Create a warehouse locally. You can use an existing folder to create a Git warehouse, or create a new folder as a Git warehouse. 3. Initialize the Git warehouse: Use the command "git init" to initialize the warehouse. 4. Add files to the warehouse: Use the command "git add filename" to add files to the temporary storage area of the warehouse. 5. Submit the modification: Use the command "git commit -m 'commit description'" to submit the modification to the Git repository. 6. View operation history: Use the command "git log" to view the operation history in the Git repository. 7. Branch management: Use the command "git branch branch name" to create a new branch or use "git checkout branch name" to switch branches, and use "git merge branch name" to merge branches. 8. Remote warehouse management: Use the command "git remote add remote warehouse alias remote warehouse address" to add a remote warehouse, and use "git push remote warehouse alias branch name" to push local changes to the remote warehouse. 9. Synchronize update: Use the command "git pull remote warehouse alias branch name" to synchronize the remote warehouse update to the local. 10. Resolve conflicts: If multiple people modify the same file, conflicts will occur. Use "git diff file name" to view the modification differences, manually modify the conflicts, and submit again.
