### Installation Attempt

```

### Solution
The error indicates that the Python development headers are missing. These headers are necessary for compiling C extensions for Python.

#### Step 1: Install Python Development Headers
You can install the Python 2.5 development headers using your package manager. For example, on a Debian-based system, you can use `aptitude`:

```sh
sudo aptitude install python2.5-dev
```

If `python2.5-dev` is not available, you might need to look for a similar package name, such as `python-dev`.

#### Step 2: Reattempt Installation
After installing the development headers, try running the installation command again:

```sh
easy_install-2.5 python-ldap
```

This should resolve the compilation issues and allow the `python-ldap` package to be installed successfully.
