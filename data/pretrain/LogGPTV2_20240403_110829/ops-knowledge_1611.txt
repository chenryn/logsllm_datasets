User:  Suppose you need to modify the suffixes of all files in a directory in batches, which command would you use to complete the task?
Assistant: would use the "rename" command to accomplish this. For example, to change the suffix of all ".txt" files to ".md", you can use the following command: rename 's/\.txt$/.md/' *.txt
