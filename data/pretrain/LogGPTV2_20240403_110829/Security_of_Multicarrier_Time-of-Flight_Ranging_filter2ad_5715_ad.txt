symbols to achieve orthogonal equalization under a channel, should
not be used in symbols used for secure ranging, as it provides an
additional advantage to the early-detecting adversary. The rationale
behind the cyclic prefix is to prepend the trailing samples of the
symbol at its beginning and, in turn, to circularize the Fourier matrix
under a time-dispersive channel. This creates symbol redundancy
which helps an early-detecting attacker.
5.3.3 PAPR reduction techniques. Orthogonal noise with a ran-
dom phase shift is compatible with techniques for peak-to-average
power reduction, as phase randomization is one of those techniques.
Another technique for PAPR reduction is to reduce the symbol set
to low-PAPR symbols. With BPSK and QPSK, pruning the sym-
bol set of high-PAPR symbols tends to remove symbols with very
stringent late-commit constraints, which might add to the overall
vulnerability of those configurations.
6 RELATED WORK
We compare our analysis of multicarrier-based ranging with ex-
isting proposals for secure single-carrier ranging, as well as other
physical-layer concepts in wireless communication. In particular,
we focus on mechanisms that attempt to protect a wireless signal
on the physical layer. Secure ranging achieves a similar goal since
it has to guarantee that the arrival time of the signal can not be
subverted by external influence, in addition to the protection of
physical layer attributes and data integrity.
6.1 Single-carrier Ranging
Research has yielded a handful of protocols for secure single-carrier
ranging and distance measurements. The majority of them focus
on ultrawide-band radio (UWB), a technology that provides non-
cooperative communication at bandwidths of up to 500 MHz. Due
to their wide spectral use, UWB devices have to operate at limited
output power, but the high bandwidth allows them to send short
pulses that have high immunity to multi-path fading. If data is
encapsulated in nano-second pulses, the surface for ED/LC attacks
is very narrow since an attacker is forced to advance or delay single
pulses. Different effective proposals that describe how pulses need
to be emitted can be found in [17, 24].
The UWB technology has also resulted in few commercial prod-
ucts [1, 2]. However, the main disadvantage of UWB ranging is its
limited power output and as a consequence, distances greater than
50 to 100 meters (depending on channel conditions) are difficult
to overcome. As a remedy, frame size has to be increased, but this
leads to long communication times in an already uncoordinated
spectrum. UWB ranging is therefore mainly used for indoor po-
sitioning or in two-device configurations, such as key-less entry
systems for vehicles.
OFDM, on the other hand, has proven to be an extremely reli-
able modulation technique. While techniques for improving the
performance of OFDM-based ranging have been proposed [13], its
security against physical-layer attacks has, to the best of our knowl-
edge, not been studied so far. OFDM-based communication systems
can cover distances on the order of kilometers and coordinate many
co-existing devices, such as in 4G and the new 5G standard. On
the downside, symbol length for OFDM-encoded data is generally
longer than UWB pulses—an important reason to study the security
of OFDM systems when used for ranging.
6.2 Physical-Layer Integrity Protection
Schemes and Jamming
There exist many physical-layer schemes that aim to guarantee the
integrity of transmitted data. They can roughly be divided into ran-
domness extraction from the channel (key establishment), MIMO-
based approaches (orthogonal blinding, zero-forcing), friendly jam-
ming and integrity codes [9].
The concept of friendly jamming is related to the countermea-
sures for OFDM-based ranging that we propose in this work. The
idea behind phase randomization and orthogonal noise is similar
to that of friendly jamming [10, 21] where an attacker can not
separate the information-bearing message from a jamming signal
emitted by a friendly jammer. The concept of intentional signal
interference can be used to establish confidentiality, message au-
thentication or access control [14, 27]. Reactive jamming on the
other hand tries to analyze and react to packets in the air [7] in
order to annihilate/overwrite certain packets or prevent communi-
cation altogether. This is related to the problem statement of the
ED/LC attack described in this paper. In reactive jamming, it is
crucial to detect a signal very early on, i.e., only based on parts of
896Security of Multicarrier Time-of-Flight Ranging

it, to have maximum impact when interfering with the remainder
of the signal.
Probably most related to our work is the survey in [18] that
compares different approaches to physical-layer security in OFDM.
Most of the presented methods are concerned with confidentiality
either on the data bits or on the symbol level. The main idea is to
encrypt or obfuscate the signal and/or provide resiliency against
interference [23]. The idea we present in this paper is similar in
the sense that an attacker should not be able to predict the trans-
mitted signal. However, we propose secure ranging schemes that
protect the communication on the symbol level, rather than en-
tire messages. Furthermore, we are specifically concerned with the
learning/listening time that an attacker requires until the remainder
of the symbol can be predicted since this is the crucial factor that
facilitates secure time-of-flight ranging.
7 CONCLUSION
We highlighted the vulnerability of highly performant OFDM mod-
ulation schemes for ToF distance measurement against an ED/LC
attacker operating on the physical layer. Existing proposals for
secure ToF distance measurement developed for single-carrier mod-
ulation methods require time-domain focusing of bit-information
(pulsing) and time-domain padding. This work identified another
possible direction suited to OFDM systems, using all subcarriers in
parallel with randomized constellations.

Proof. An OFDM time-domain sample can be represented as the
IFFT of the frequency-domain modulated symbol samples. In the
following, we will show that left-right antivalent bits (i.e., bits that
do not repeat after ns/2 samples) are leaked with the first odd
(respectively, any odd) sample. For the first odd sample, we have

since

Due to the limited constellation set of BPSK modulation (i.e., Ck ∈
{−1, 1}), we can express the difference between frequency-domain
samples in terms of a logical bit-level operation:
c1 = 2
Ck(bk ⊕ bk +ns/2)e

The negative sign is equivalent to a π-phase rotation of the complex
exponential, therefore, equivalently:

Hence,

on bits that repeat after ns/2 samples, however, conveys all infor-
mation about bits that are inverted after ns/2 samples. Conversely,
the first non-zero even sample (i.e., the sample c2) is oblivious to
information about tones that repeat after ns/4 samples, however
conveys information about antivalence of tones ns/4 apart.
In the following, we consider the sequence of samples with
indices that are powers of two (l = 2L and 0 ≤ L < M).
From sample c1, we learn the sequence Ck(bk ⊕ bk +ns/2), i.e.,
the values of the left-right antisymmetric bits. We can create a
2π i2k/ns and add it
to c2, which recovers the equivalent sample of the IFFT on the first
half of the spectrum only, since
