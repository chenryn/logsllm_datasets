User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to add a timestamp to bash script log? I have a constantly running script that I output to a log file:

script.sh &gt;&gt; /var/log/logfile


I'd like to add a timestamp before each line that is appended to the log.  Like:

Sat Sep 10 21:33:06 UTC 2011 The server has booted up.  Hmmph.


Is there any jujitsu I can use?

Assistant: You can pipe the script's output through a loop that prefixes the current date and time:

./script.sh | while IFS= read -r line; do printf '%s %s\n' "$(date)" "$line"; done &gt;&gt;/var/log/logfile


If you'll be using this a lot, it's easy to make a bash function to handle the loop:

adddate() {
    while IFS= read -r line; do
        printf '%s %s\n' "$(date)" "$line";
    done
}

./thisscript.sh | adddate &gt;&gt;/var/log/logfile
./thatscript.sh | adddate &gt;&gt;/var/log/logfile
./theotherscript.sh | adddate &gt;&gt;/var/log/logfile
