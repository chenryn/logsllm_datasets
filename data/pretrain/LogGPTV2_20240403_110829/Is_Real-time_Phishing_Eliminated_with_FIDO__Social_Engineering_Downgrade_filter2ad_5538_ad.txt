Security). In fact, repeated login prompts can provide users
with a false sense of security, because the system appears
more secure if it asks for two factors at every login. P22-N
explained, “I think when I clicked on the one that didn’t ask
[...] for the two factor authentication, it just went straight to
the [Google] Doc then I [thought] something bad happened.
Because every other time [...] it would ask me to sign in again
[...] but that one suddenly didn’t. And it just makes me kind
of feel like ‘uh-oh what happened?!”’
Participants also discussed non-technical indicators, such
as poor grammar and styling, and the presence of a hyperlink
in the email. Other non-technical indicators stem from the
participant’s knowledge of the sender, including that the tone
of the email was unexpected, the language of the email did
not match that of the sender (sender language consistency),
and that the email was out of context. P16-E said, “If it is
just, like my boss sending a book to download, and we talked
about it, it’s ﬁne. But if it is a random book, then it’s weird.”
Non-technical indicators rely exclusively on users’ judge-
ment, are inconclusive, and are relatively easy to manipulate.
For example, while context appears to alert some users against
phishing (as described herein and in previous work [46]), at-
tackers can adjust their techniques to increase their phishing
emails’ credibility [84]. In fact, an email can have an expected
tone, a language that appears consistent with the legitimate
sender’s, relevant context, proper grammar and styling, no
hyperlink, and yet belong to a phishing campaign.
None of our participants mentioned relying on FIDO to
identify phishing emails, and rightfully so. It is not quite clear
how FIDO can be used as a complete phishing indicator—it
may benignly fail due to technical errors, e.g., broken dongle.
and were protected against phishing because they were using
FIDO (using FIDO/2FA). Interestingly, requiring the use of
Google Authenticator (part of our attack) gave some partici-
pants a false sense of security. P21-N said, “I had to put in the
information [code] as well and I felt secure: the company even
took me to verify everything [using the Google Authenticator]
to make sure that it was secured”. These participants either
viewed the authenticator an additional factor or assumed it
was part of FIDO, and some even thought FIDO was more
secure because of the authenticator. P10-E explained, “If you
have to use the authentication app on the phone, with the
changing number always, it is really difﬁcult for someone to
hack your system to ﬁnd this kind of information.”
Non-technical reasons also emerged for classifying emails
as safe, based on context and the user’s expectations (e.g., their
social and professional life). For example, users expect to re-
ceive emails from their institutions’ ofﬁcial communication
channels, which gives these emails credibility. This ﬁnding
mirrors that of Conway et al. [16] where participants felt more
secure at work. We also found, similar to previous work [6],
that participants relied on quickly inspecting the login inter-
face or the content (e.g., a Google Sheet) to which the link
in the email redirects, and comparing it to their expectations.
P18-N explained, “I think I did a little bit of due diligence
when I signed in, so [I] should be OK. Like I checked when I
was logging in [that] I was logging in to the right thing. Most
of the things that came up were Gmail and Outlook. The only
one document that [I] opened was a Google document which
did ask for my authentication” (as part of our attack).
In summary, we highlight that participants cited FIDO as
one of the reasons for classifying as safe, when they have in
fact fell for our phishing attack. As such, FIDO did not only
fail to protect them, but it potentially gave them a false sense
of security. FIDO can be relied upon as a safety indicator
when it works successfully, without having the user authorize
any other factors (beyond the initial password).
7.2.3 Takeaway
7.2.2 Reasons for classifying emails as safe
When examining reasons why participants identiﬁed emails
as safe, we found that they again relied on technical and non-
technical indicators (Table 3). As many participants ended-up
misclassifying emails as safe, such reasons may have mis-
guided participants. In these cases, participants erroneously
interpreted the URL (linked in the email) as a safety indica-
tor. For example, some participants concluded they were safe
from phishing because opening the links in the emails did not
lead to obviously malicious behaviour (e.g., popups). Others
(n = 3) indicated they “felt more secure with 2FA” (P23-E)
Despite using FIDO, we noticed that none of the participants
have relied, or indicated that they would rely, on FIDO for
detecting phishing attempts. In contrast, we had three partic-
ipants who said they were secure because they used FIDO
in all their logins, even when some of these were accompa-
nied by other authentication factors. Evidenced by our attacks,
the proper usage would be to refuse to login with alternative
methods if a user has enabled FIDO. Seeing a FIDO-only
login is practically opposite to using FIDO alongside other
factors—the former prevents downgrade attacks, the latter
enables them. We found no evidence that any of our 51 par-
ticipants understood this concept.

Reasons for classifying emails as phishing
URL
The URL of the hyperlink in the email is suspicious
“The URL looks really weird, I think it’s not safe, or like that’s not the normal. This is just like fanciness that looks
like Google” (P11-E)
Repeated logins
The participant is required to login although they have al-
ready logged in and the session is supposed to be maintained
“I logged in my Gmail, and then I clicked on an email again. And I had to, re-enter my login credentials. Like
something like this ought to be kind of phishing” (P15-N)
Tone

Context

Grammar

Hyperlink
The tone of the email is unexpected (e.g., demanding, or not
professional as expected in the workplace), or the email does
not include greetings or greets the receiver by their username
rather than their name
The language in the email is not consistent with how the
sender usually writes emails
The circumstances surrounding the email received and its
subject; the timing of the email in terms of events is inappro-
priate/unexpected
The email contains mistakes in grammar, punctuation, or
capitalization
“ ‘We demand you’ I feel like somebody would not be using that kind of language at work.” (P1-N) “One email
was not addressed to me with a name, but to the username, so it looked like a bot.” (P19-E)
“[That’s] not the right person, that’s not the person I know from the way, it’s the tone of writing and the language
and the way it’s said.” (P20-N)
“there was [an email] that [was] for a job or something, and I was thinking I already have a job, I thought it was
weird” (P14-E)
“Now that I’m thinking about it, that was deﬁnitely a phishing email. Because of how poorly worded it was.”
(P17-N)
The email includes a hyperlink
“Um well, most of the red ﬂags I got were from when there is a link in it.” (P7-N)

looked legit to me” (P2-N)
“I don’t know that anything is entirely compromised but maybe I clicked on a link, but I didn’t see any indicators
of that. Like I didn’t see like any pop ups or any extra spam come in or anything like that” (P25-N)
“It kind of seemed to be ﬁne, I suppose I felt more secure with with the 2FA [FIDO token] because they cannot
steal all information if it is encrypted.” (P23-E)
“I had to put in the information [code] as well and I felt secure: the company even took me to verify everything
[using the Google Authenticator] to make sure that it was secured” (P21-N) “More steps [authenticator + FIDO],
more security” (P13-E)
“I veriﬁed their email [address] and some like I would assume that, that is the legitimate person” (P11-N)
“I am kind of a lazy person and as I said before I rely on my antivirus too much, but I guess it is what it is” (P11-E)
Communication
channel
The emails and linked content were sent through the ofﬁcial
company emails, by employees of the company
“I didn’t open something that looked suspicious. [...] Everything was from ofﬁcial channels, from work, so I think
it should be ok.” (P10-E)
Login interface
The login interface looked legitimate
“I was logging in to the right thing. Most of the things that came up were Gmail and Outlook.” (P18-N)

The hyperlink in the email redirected the user to the expected

like I just clicked on a link and it brought me to some random some random page or something, it was related to
what the e-mail was saying. So it seems legitimate to me.” (P10-N)
The circumstances surrounding the email received and its
subject; the timing of the email in terms of events is appro-
priate/expected
“If it is just, like my boss sending a book to download, and we talked about it, it’s ﬁne. But if it is a random book,
then it’s weird. [...] I think if [the download book email] was sent to me in real life, I would click on it, because it
is mentioning nanotechnoloty, it has a context that makes sense” (P16-E)
Sender
The receiver knows the sender, the email is not from a com-
plete stranger
“Since this is a secure network, and all the people that were sending me emails were company, colleges, I suppose
there were no phishing emails” (P24-E)

8 Discussions and Countermeasures
We provide practical insights regarding potential defenses,
based on our study results and our analysis of the attack itself.
8.1 Disable Weaker Alternatives
A straightforward countermeasure to the downgrade attack
presented herein is to disable alternative 2FA methods if a user
enables FIDO. This would have mitigated situations where
our participants thought the extra factor was a feature rather
than an indicator of attack. Google’s advanced protection
program [32] achieves this for critical accounts, e.g., those
of politicians or journalists. The program is opt-in and users
must register at least two security keys, one for daily use,7 and
others as backup. Google does not detail the recovery process
in case both keys are unavailable, but states that “it may take
a few days to verify it’s you and restore your access”. This
delay poses a major trade-off for users.
Limitation: non-scalable recovery. Doeﬂer et al. [20] re-
port that challenges requiring security keys have a lower pass
rate than device-based ones. So, if alternatives were disabled,
more users would need the recovery process. On the other
hand, such recovery adds signiﬁcant costs to service providers,
and does not scale to millions of users [61]. Disabling weaker
FIDO alternatives comes at the cost of non-scalable recovery.
Limitation: usability impact. Previous literature [14, 24,
7A phone running Android 7+, or iOS 10+ with the Google Smart Lock
app, can be used as one security key.
USENIX Association
30th USENIX Security Symposium    3821
73] reported that users have difﬁculties enrolling security keys
into their accounts, and are concerned about being locked out
if keys are lost. Registering multiple keys can enhance the
user experience but may be costly for users,8 which might
be a barrier to some users. Moreover, service providers tend
to facilitate user onboarding and enhance overall experience
by offering a variety of channels to connect to its backend,
e.g., browsers, native apps on different OSes, or third-party
software such as email clients. Disabling FIDO alternatives
can degrade usability because channels that do not support
FIDO should then be dropped—otherwise, the attacker con-
nects to the server through such channels.
8.2 Risk Based Authentication
Risk-based Authentication (RBA) refers to a set of server-side
techniques to assess the risk of an authentication attempt, and
block malicious ones [35,79,89]. Secure IP geolocation [1,2],
device, network, user agent, and installed plugins are exam-
ples of metadata that RBA systems analyze for deciding the
risk score of a login attempt. A low risk attempt (e.g., same
user agent and same IP address) gives conﬁdence to the server
that the honest user is authenticating. For higher risk requests,
the server challenges the user to provide additional factors, or
restricts user’s access depending on the provider’s policy [90].
Limitation: mimicry of user’s attributes/behaviour. A
recent study [12] shows that attackers have already developed
malicious tools that can circumvent RBA defenses. Such
tools are made available as public services. Campobasso and
Allodi [12] reveal that attackers collect necessary data from
victims on top of their credentials, so they can bypass RBA de-
fenses. Similarly, an adversary performing real-time phishing
can adapt such tools to bypass RBA mechanisms on-the-ﬂy.
This adversary has a connection with the victim’s browser,
and may be able to mimic attributes/behaviours to the legiti-
mate website [3], or execute the JavaScript code (related to
RBA analysis) directly on the victim user’s browser.
8.3 Browser Hints
The recent WebAuthn API [8] instructs browsers to always
show a prompt window when a website interacts with the
authenticator during both registration and authentication. The
prompt is part of the user consent process, which means that
