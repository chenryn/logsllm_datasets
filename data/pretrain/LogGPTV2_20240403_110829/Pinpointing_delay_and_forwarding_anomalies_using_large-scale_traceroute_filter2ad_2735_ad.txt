Next hops that differ from those observed in the past can indicate an anomalous pattern. Such a pattern may be caused by just a few aberrant next hops. To identify the hops responsible for these changes, we have devised a metric. Let \( F = \{p_i | i \in [1, n]\} \) represent the anomalous pattern and \( \bar{F} = \{\bar{p}_i | i \in [1, n]\} \) the computed normal reference. The responsibility of the next hop \( i \) for the pattern change is quantified as:

\[
r_i = \frac{p_i - \bar{p}_i}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} |p_j - \bar{p}_j|}
\]

The responsibility metric \( r_i \) ranges from \([-1, 1]\). Values close to zero indicate that the next hop \( i \) received a typical number of packets and is likely not responsible for the pattern change. Conversely, values deviating from zero suggest anomalous next hops. Positive values indicate newly observed hops, while negative values represent hops with an unusually low number of packets.

For example, consider Figure 4a, which depicts \( \bar{F}_R \), the computed normal reference for router \( R \), and Figure 4b, which illustrates \( F_R \), the latest forwarding pattern observed. The correlation coefficient for these patterns, \( \rho_{F_R, \bar{F}_R} = -0.6 \), is lower than the threshold \( \tau \), indicating that \( F_R \) is anomalous. The responsibility scores for A, B, C, and Z are 0, -0.28, 0.25, and 0.07, respectively. This suggests that packets are typically transmitted to A and Z, but the number of packets to B is abnormally low, while the count to C is exceptionally high. In other words, traffic usually forwarded to B is now being redirected through C. If a next hop drops a significant number of packets, its responsibility score will be negative, while the score for Z will be positive.

### Detection of Major Events

The proposed delay analysis method (ยง 4) and packet forwarding model (ยง 5) are designed to report anomalies found in large-scale traceroute measurements. Using RIPE Atlas, these methods allow us to monitor hundreds of thousands of links, potentially generating a large number of alarms (i.e., either delay changes or forwarding anomalies). Investigating each alarm can be very tedious and time-consuming.

In this section, we introduce a simple technique to aggregate alarms and report only significant network disruptions.

#### Alarm Aggregation

Major network disruptions are characterized by either large-scale alterations of numerous links or exceptional connectivity issues at one or more locations. We aim to highlight both by aggregating alarms based on their temporal and spatial characteristics. Temporal grouping of alarms allows us to highlight large-scale events impacting many routers simultaneously. Similarly, collecting alarms that are topologically close helps emphasize network disruptions bound to a particular entity. In early experiments, we tried several spatial aggregations, including geographical ones, and found that grouping alarms per AS is relevant because most significant events are contained within one or a few ASs.

Consequently, we group delay change alarms by the reported IP pair and forwarding anomalies by the next hops' IP addresses. The IP to AS mapping is done using the longest prefix match, and alarms with IP addresses from different ASs are assigned to multiple groups.

Alarms from each AS are then processed to compute two time series representing the severity of reported anomalies, thus reflecting the AS's condition. The severity of anomalies is measured differently for delay changes and packet forwarding alarms. For delay changes, the severity is measured by the deviation from the normal reference, \( d(\Delta) \) (Equation 6). The severity of forwarding anomalies is given by \( r_i \), the responsibility score of the reported next hop \( i \) (Equation 9). Therefore, AS network conditions are represented by two time series: one is the sum of \( d(\Delta) \) over time, and the other is the sum of \( r_i \) over time. In the case of forwarding anomalies, \( r_i \) values are negative if a hop from the AS is devalued and positive otherwise. Consequently, if traffic usually goes through a router \( i \) but is suddenly rerouted to router \( j \), and both \( i \) and \( j \) are assigned to the same AS, the negative \( r_i \) and positive \( r_j \) values cancel out, mitigating the anomaly at the AS level.

#### Event Detection

Finding major network disruptions in an AS is done by identifying peaks in either of the two time series described above. We implement a simple outlier detection mechanism to identify these peaks.

Let \( X = \{x_t | t \in \mathbb{N}\} \) be a time series representing delay changes or forwarding anomalies for a certain AS, and let \( \text{mag}(X) \) be the magnitude of the AS network alteration defined as:

\[
\text{mag}(X) = \frac{X - \text{median}(X)}{1 + 1.4826 \times \text{MAD}(X)}
\]

where median and MAD are the one-week sliding median and median absolute deviation [49]. In the following sections, we report magnitude scores found with our dataset and investigate corresponding network disruptions.

### Results

Using Internet-wide traceroutes from RIPE Atlas (ยง 2), we report delay changes and forwarding anomalies from eight months in 2015 and 1060 ASs. In the following, we present aggregate results of the identified delay changes and forwarding anomalies. Then, we dive into case studies showing the relevance of the proposed methods to detect and locate network disruptions of different types (ยง 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3).

#### Delay Changes

In our experiments, we monitored delays for 262k IPv4 links (42k IPv6 links). On average, links are observed by 147 IPv4 probes (133 IPv6 probes), and 33% of the links were reported to have at least one abnormal delay change.

We computed the hourly delay change magnitude for each monitored AS. Figure 5a depicts the distribution of all these values. 97% of the time, we observe a magnitude lower than 1, meaning that ASs are usually free of large transient delay changes. The heavy tail of the distribution, however, indicates that delay changes can have a very detrimental impact on Internet delays. We manually inspected the most prominent delay changes but found that validating such results is particularly hard, as public reports are rarely available and Internet service providers are reluctant to disclose troubles that occurred in their networks. In Section 7.1, we detail a DDoS attack that generated congestion in several ASs and accounts for 5 of the top 23 delay changes reported in our dataset (Fig. 5a).

Furthermore, in accordance with the central limit theorem, we observe a narrower confidence interval for links visited by numerous probes; hence, a better differential RTT estimation and the ability to detect smaller delay changes.

#### Forwarding Anomalies

Using RIPE Atlas traceroutes, we also computed packet forwarding models for 170k IPv4 router IPs (87k IPv6 router IPs). These are the number of router IP addresses found in traceroutes; to resolve these to routers, IP alias resolution techniques should be deployed [26]. On average, forwarding models contain four different next hops over the eight months of data.

We computed the hourly forwarding anomaly magnitude for each AS. Figure 5b illustrates the distribution of these values. This distribution features a heavy left tail, representing a few significant forwarding anomalies due to important packet loss or traffic redirection. Namely, forwarding anomaly magnitude is lower than -10 for only 0.001% of the time. Similar to the delay changes, validating these results is challenging. In Sections 7.2 and 7.3, we investigate two significant events from the top 20 forwarding anomalies found in our dataset (Fig. 5b). These events are already publicly documented, but the proposed method provides further insights into their location and impact.

### Case Study: DDoS Attack on DNS Root Servers

Our first case study shows the impact of a large distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack on network infrastructure. The simplest form of DDoS attack consists of sending a huge number of requests to a targeted service, overwhelming the service and leaving little or no resources for legitimate use. The extremely large amount of traffic generated by this type of attack is not only detrimental to the victim but also to routers in its proximity.

We investigate network disruptions caused by two DDoS attacks against DNS root servers. These attacks have been briefly documented by root server operators [39, 48]. The first attack occurred on November 30th from 06:50 to 09:30 UTC, and the second on December 1st from 05:10 until 06:10 UTC. As the source IP addresses for both attacks were spoofed, it is unclear from reports [48] where the traffic originated.

Thanks to the K-root operators, we were able to carefully validate our results for the attack toward the K name server and the corresponding AS (AS25152).

#### Event Detection

Monitoring the delay change magnitude for AS25152 clearly shows the two attacks against the K-root infrastructure (Fig. 6). The two peaks on November 30th and December 1st highlight significant network disruptions. The highest forwarding anomaly magnitude for AS25152 is recorded on November 30th at 08:00 and is negative (mag(X) = -0.5), meaning that only a few packets have been dropped in ASs hosting root servers. These observations match the server operators' reports and emphasize the strength of anycast in mitigating such attacks.

#### In-Depth Analysis: K-root

A key advantage of our method is reporting delay changes per link, allowing us to precisely locate the effects of the two attacks. Not only are the last hops to K-root instances detected by our method; we also observe other links with important delay changes. Figure 7e depicts a link in the Deutscher Commercial Internet Exchange (DE-CIX) which is upstream of the K-root instance in Frankfurt (Fig. 7c). This link between Hurricane-Electric (AS6939) and the K-root AS exhibits a 15ms delay change (difference between the median differential RTT and the reference median) during the first attack. The upstream link of the instance in St. Petersburg (Fig. 7f) is also significantly affected.
