### Rhode Island: Fiscal and Interoperability Sustainability

**Current Situation:**
There is a lack of a clear, sustainable fiscal mechanism for ensuring long-term financial stability. The Rhode Island state leadership has shown political and fiscal support by securing federal grant funds. However, the extent of local participation in these communications interoperability efforts remains unclear.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Identify and Engage Stakeholders:**
   - Identify local first responders (e.g., police, fire services) and federal agencies (e.g., US Coast Guard) to participate in the decision-making group.
   - Develop formal roles and responsibilities for all participants.

2. **Establish Formal Membership:**
   - Create a charter to encourage formal membership in the decision-making group, including all first responder agencies.

3. **Develop and Finalize Agreements:**
   - Draft and finalize regional communications interoperability agreements, such as memoranda of understanding, and ensure local-level participation.

4. **Develop a Regional Strategic Plan:**
   - Create, document, and implement a regional strategic plan that goes beyond the operational focus of the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) and the statewide 800 MHz system plan.
   - Ensure the plan includes participant approval, adoption, and acceptance, and addresses long-term funding strategies beyond grants.

5. **Align Strategic Planning Efforts:**
   - Align local and statewide strategic planning to meet region-wide interoperability needs.

6. **Secure Long-Term Funding:**
   - Identify sustainable funding sources (e.g., 3 to 5 years) for communications interoperability, covering lifecycle costs beyond grant funding.

7. **Engage Executive-Level Officials:**
   - Involve local, executive-level officials with political and fiscal authority to focus specifically on interoperability.

### Providence Area: Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

**Current Situation:**
The Providence area has incorporated existing policies and procedures from local law enforcement, fire, and emergency medical services (EMS) agencies, as well as hospitals, into the TICP. This plan serves as the areaâ€™s first comprehensive set of interoperable communications SOPs, and steps have been taken to disseminate them throughout the area. While the TICP Peer Review panel noted that the area met minimal requirements, it is evident that public safety personnel are well-versed in the SOPs. Local officials reported that most public safety agencies participated in creating the TICP. Providence began implementing NIMS/ICS over a year ago, and all public safety agencies use these procedures. However, the TICP validation exercise highlighted areas for improvement, such as under-staffed communications units and the use of resources outside those included in the TICP.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Update TICP:**
   - Revise the TICP to include updated policies and procedures for applicable assets (e.g., availability of additional shared channels).

2. **Develop Policy on Commercial Services:**
   - Consider developing policies on the use and limitations of commercial services (e.g., cellular telephones).

3. **Training and Exercises:**
   - Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs, including communications unit implementation consistent with the TICP, to ensure NIMS/ICS compliance.

### Usage: Early Implementation

**Current Situation:**
While the area reports the use of shared channels and gateways, it is evident that these means of interoperable communications are not used regularly. During the TICP validation exercise, participants did not exhibit proficiency in using these solutions. For example, the two identified shared channels do not support the tactical needs of critical incidents, and participants were unsuccessful in implementing a gateway patch.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Implement After Action Report Recommendations:**
   - Address the recommendations in the After Action Report regarding additional equipment (e.g., establish a radio cache).

2. **Regular Testing and Exercises:**
   - Regularly test and exercise the deployment of regional interoperability resources (e.g., shared channels, gateways) to improve proficiency.

3. **Incorporate Interoperability in Exercises:**
   - Include communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.

### Technology Overview

**Current Situation:**
Providence Police uses an ultra-high frequency system, while the Providence Fire Department uses a very high frequency system. The Fire Department and EMS are on separate systems that do not connect. Both departments have shared channels that can be programmed into other agencies' radios. The State of Rhode Island is implementing a statewide 800 MHz radio system, with plans for all public safety agencies to be on this system.

### Charleston (South Carolina): Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecard

**Summary:**
- **Governance:** Intermediate Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Established Implementation
- **Usage:** Established Implementation

**Current Situation:**
Charleston was brought together to address interoperability after Hurricane Hugo 16 years ago. Today, communications are overseen by the Lowcountry Interoperable Communications Council (LICC). The TICP needed clarification on the term "RSAG" to avoid confusion. Interoperability partnerships are a mix of formal and informal agreements. A strategic planning process is underway but no plan has been published. Funding decisions are driven by individual agency needs rather than a regional strategy.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Clarify Membership:**
   - Clarify state and federal membership in the decision-making group (e.g., LICC) and increase rural public safety agency involvement.

2. **Define Roles and Responsibilities:**
   - Identify and define the roles and responsibilities of "RSAG."

3. **Document Agreements:**
   - Reference all applicable agreements (e.g., MOUs, intergovernmental agreements) in the TICP and store them in an accessible format.

4. **Develop and Implement a Strategic Plan:**
   - Develop, document, and implement a Lowcountry regional strategic plan with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance, addressing long-term funding.

5. **Align Strategic Planning:**
   - Align local and state strategic planning to meet regional interoperability needs.

6. **Funding Strategy:**
   - Document the Lowcountry regional funding strategy to identify sustainable funding sources (beyond grants) for lifecycle and recurring costs.

7. **Strengthen Governance:**
   - Broaden and champion a governance structure that supports regional communications interoperability.

8. **Involve Senior Leadership:**
   - Involve senior regional leadership in communications interoperability and long-term funding plans.

### Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): Established Implementation

**Current Situation:**
The Charleston TICP consolidates existing county interoperable communications SOPs into a regional plan, which has been distributed to all agencies and dispatch centers. There are plans for regular interoperability training. Charleston officials are creating a three-page quick guide to ensure ease of use and understanding by all responders. Use of the SOPs was successfully demonstrated, but additional information should be added to the TICP. NIMS/ICS is being implemented, but command and control issues occurred during the TICP validation exercise.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Update TICP:**
   - Update the TICP to incorporate all available interoperable communications equipment (e.g., mobile gateway).

2. **Document Points of Contact:**
   - Document, distribute, and verify all points of contact for each agency communications center.

3. **Continue Training and Exercises:**
   - Continue to implement regional interoperability SOPs and conduct basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs and NIMS/ICS to ensure compliance, particularly for rural agencies.

### Usage: Established Implementation

**Current Situation:**
Multi-agency communications in the Charleston area are regularly accomplished using two 800 MHz systems and a VHF shared system, along with national shared channels. During the TICP validation exercise, evaluators noted that the use of these systems appeared second nature to most responding organizations. The need for gateway patches is diminished due to shared systems, but sufficient training should be provided if gateways are used. Despite minor equipment usage issues, interoperability was continuously maintained during the exercise. Federal agencies are fully coordinated in the LICC and participate in multijurisdictional responses.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Involve State and Federal Agencies:**
   - Continue to involve state and federal agencies in day-to-day events and future exercises.

2. **Include Interoperability in Evaluations:**
   - Add interoperable communications as an evaluation component for all future exercises and day-to-day activities.

### Technology Overview

**Current Situation:**
Charleston County, Dorchester County, and the City of Charleston use shared 800 MHz Motorola SmartZone analog systems. The state also has a statewide 800 MHz SmartZone analog system used by agencies in Berkeley and Dorchester counties. Berkeley County has a separate VHF system that is interoperable with other counties using gateways and cache radios. Most of the radios are from Charleston County. The area also has various gateways and shared channels.

### Sioux Falls (South Dakota): Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecard

**Summary:**
- **Governance:** Advanced Implementation

Shared channels and the shared system are used daily, and this familiarity was demonstrated during the validation exercise.

**Recommendation:**

1. **Include Interoperability in Future Exercises:**
   - Consider adding communications interoperability as a component for all future exercises.

### Technology Overview

**Current Situation:**
South Dakota employs a statewide VHF digital trunked radio system, allowing for clear communications over 90% of the geographic area. Lincoln County uses its own conventional UHF radio system, and interoperability between Minnehaha and Lincoln counties is achieved through mobile repeaters and portable radios. A backup conventional system is in place, and the metropolitan area uses a mixture of shared channels, talk groups, gateways, and cached radios.

### Nashville (Tennessee): Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecard

**Summary:**
- **Governance:** Intermediate Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Intermediate Implementation
