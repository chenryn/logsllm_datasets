there is no clear sustainable mechanism for fiscal sustainability.  The Rhode Island state leadership has 
demonstrated political and fiscal support by obtaining federal grant funds, but the level of local participation 
in these communications interoperability efforts is unclear. 
Recommendations:  
• 
Identify local first responders and federal agencies (e.g., police, fire services, USCG), in addition to state 
agencies, to participate in the decision-making group, and develop formal roles and responsibilities of the 
participants 
• 
Establish a charter to encourage formal membership in the decision-making group (including all first 
responder agencies) 
• 
Develop and finalize regional communications interoperability agreements (e.g., memoranda of 
understanding), and involve all participants at the local level   
• 
Develop, document, and implement a regional strategic plan (beyond the operational focus of the 
Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) and the statewide 800 MHz system plan) with 
participant approval, adoption, and acceptance that takes into account a long-term communications 
funding strategy beyond grants 
• 
Align local and statewide strategic planning efforts to ensure regionwide interoperability needs are met 
• 
Identify long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) sustainable funding for communications interoperability, beyond 
grants, that can cover lifecycle costs 
• 
Consider the direct involvement of local, executive-level official(s), with political and fiscal authority, to 
specifically focus on interoperability

The Providence area incorporated existing policies and procedures from local law enforcement, fire, and 
emergency medical services (EMS) agencies, as well as hospitals into the TICP.  This plan serves as the 
area’s first comprehensive set of interoperable communications SOPs, and steps have been taken to 
disseminate them throughout the area (e.g., participating agencies attended a TICP Workshop to review the 
revised SOPs).  Although the TICP Peer Review panel noted that “the area met the minimal requirements 
[for TICP development],” it is evident from the area agencies’ successful demonstration of communications 
interoperability solution policies, practices, and procedures that Providence public safety personnel are well 
versed in the SOPs defined for the area.  Local officials reported that most of the public safety agencies in the 
area participated in creating the TICP.  Providence began implementing the National Incident Management 
System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) more than 1 year ago, and all public safety agencies in the 
area use these procedures.  The TICP validation exercise, however, highlighted areas for improvement in 
command and control (e.g., the communications unit was under-staffed, responders used resources outside 
those included in the TICP).  This indicates that the understanding and application of SOPs can be improved.  
Recommendations: 
• 
Revise the TICP to include updated policies and procedures for applicable assets (e.g., availability of 
additional shared channels) 
• 
Consider developing policy on use and limitations of commercial services (e.g., cellular telephones) 
• 
Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit 
implementation consistent with the TICP)   to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain 
and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance

Although the area reports the use of shared channels and gateways, it is evident that the area does not use 
these available means of interoperable communications regularly.  During the TICP validation exercise, 
participants did not exhibit proficiency in using these communications interoperability solutions.  For 
example, the area’s two identified shared channels are not designed to support the tactical needs of a critical 
incident, and participants were unsuccessful in implementing a gateway patch.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Implement the recommendations identified in the After Action Report regarding additional equipment 
(e.g., establish a radio cache) 
• 
Regularly test and exercise deployment of regional interoperability resources (e.g., shared channels, 
gateways) to improve proficiency  
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

Currently, Providence Police uses an ultra high frequency system, while the Providence Fire Department uses a very 
high frequency system.  The Fire Department and EMS are on separate systems that do not connect in any way.  The 
Providence Police and Fire Department each have a shared channel that can be programmed into other police and fire 
agencies’ radios.  The State of Rhode Island is implementing a statewide 800 MHz radio system.  All public safety 
agencies in the state are planned to be on this system.

The Charleston area was brought together to address interoperability in the aftermath of Hurricane Hugo 16 
years ago.  Today, communications in the Charleston area is overseen by a formal communications group 
(Lowcountry Interoperable Communications Council [LICC]).  It was noted in the peer review that the term 
“RSAG” that was used in the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) needed to be defined, as it 
could otherwise lead to confusion regarding the appropriate governance structure for interoperable 
communications efforts.  Interoperability partnerships are a combination of formal and informal agreements.  
The continued development of documented agreements would support the formalization of these partnerships 
to ensure clear roles and responsibilities relating to communications interoperability issues and decisions.  
Charleston indicates that a strategic planning process is underway, but no plan has been published.  This 
strategy, as it gets adopted, can also support the prioritization of goals so that funding can be planned 
accordingly.  While consideration for regional interoperability is provided by the LICC, funding decisions 
are largely driven by individual agency needs as opposed to a Lowcountry regionwide strategy.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Clarify state and federal membership in the decision-making group (e.g., LICC), and examine ways (e.g., 
varying schedules and locations) to increase rural public safety agency involvement (e.g., volunteer fire 
departments) 
• 
Identify “RSAG” and its roles and responsibilities 
• 
Reference all applicable agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding, intergovernmental agreements) 
in the TICP and store them in an accessible format 
• 
Develop, document, and implement a Lowcountry regional strategic plan (beyond the operational TICP) 
with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance, that takes into account a long-term funding strategy  
• 
Align local and state strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met 
• 
Document the Lowcountry regional funding strategy for identifying sustainable funding sources (beyond 
grants) to cover lifecycle and recurring costs to operate the area’s interoperability assets 
• 
Broaden and champion a governance structure that will support regional communications interoperability  
• 
Involve senior regional leadership in communications interoperability and long-term funding plans

commendable.  Use of the SOPs were successfully demonstrated; however, additional information should be 
added to the TICP, including all available regional interoperable communications assets.  The National 
Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) is currently being implemented 
throughout the area.  Command and control issues occurred in the TICP validation exercise (e.g., did not 
initiate comprehensive incident command structure, delay in designating communications unit leader) 
relating to NIMS/ICS procedures.  Charleston has recognized some of these deficiencies, and is actively 
addressing the improvement plan (e.g., NIMS/ICS 300/400 classes). 
Recommendations: 
• 
Update TICP to incorporate all available interoperable communications equipment (e.g., mobile gateway 
not accounted for in TICP) 
• 
Document, distribute, and verify all points of contact for each agency communications center 
• 
Continue to implement regional interoperability SOPs across all participating agencies 
• 
Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (e.g., system resources) and for NIMS/ICS

Multi-agency communications in the Charleston area is regularly accomplished using two 800 megahertz 
(MHz) systems and a very high frequency (VHF) shared system, along with national shared channels.  
During the TICP validation exercise, evaluators noted that the use of these systems “appeared second nature 
to most of the responding organizations and disciplines.”  Because the area is served by shared systems, the 
need for gateway patches is diminished.  If gateways are used, sufficient training should be given to ensure 
proficient and proper use.  Despite minor equipment usage issues, the exercise After Action Report noted, 
“[I]nteroperability was continuously maintained for participation personnel throughout the duration of the 
exercise.”  Despite these demonstrated successes, the TICP validation exercise was limited in its inclusion of 
federal agency participants.  Officials from the area report that federal agencies are fully coordinated in the 
LICC and participate in multijurisdictional response as demonstrated through real world events.  The area is 
encouraged to build on its success by continuing to further integrating state, federal, tribal, and support 
 agencies in future tests.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to involve state and federal agencies (e.g., public health, Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. 
Coast Guard) in day-to-day events and future exercises  
• 
Consider adding interoperable communications as an evaluation component for all future exercises and 
day-to-day activities

Charleston County, Dorchester County and the City of Charleston use shared, 800 MHz, Motorola SmartZone™, analog 
systems (City of Charleston and Charleston County systems) that can be used to communicate with most local and 
county agencies.  The state also has a statewide system (Palmetto 800 MHz SmartZone analog system) that is used by 
agencies in Berkeley and Dorchester counties.  Berkeley County has a separate VHF system that is used for primary 
communications and is interoperable with the other counties using gateways and cache radios.  Berkeley, Charleston, 
Dorchester counties and the Charleston Police Department also have 800 MHz cache radios.  Most these radios are from 
Charleston County.  Charleston and Dorchester counties have Raytheon JPS Communications ACU-1000 and 
Communications-Applied Technology Incident Commander’s Radio Interface (ICRI) gateways.  The Charleston Police 
Department also has an ICRI gateway, and the State of South Carolina has an ACU-1000 gateway.  Charleston County 
and emergency medical services have shared 800 MHz channels.  Berkeley County is also purchasing an ICRI gateway.

South Dakota designated Sioux Falls as its metropolitan area (area), which includes the City of Sioux Falls 
and the counties of Minnehaha and Lincoln. 
Governance: Advanced Implementation 
South Dakota has demonstrated strong governance across multiple jurisdictions.  The area’s Metro 
Management Council (composed of representatives from the City of Sioux Falls, Minnehaha County, and 
Lincoln County) developed the regional Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP).  The 
communications committee includes the area’s public support disciplines and local leadership, but appears to 
lack federal involvement, which would be beneficial to include in the future.  The area has published and 
active agreements, which are frequently updated and reviewed.  South Dakota should be commended for its 
multiyear funding plan that takes into account local and state funding.  Once revised, the area should 
distribute the strategic plan to all regional public safety agencies.     
Recommendations: 
• 
Proactively recruit new participants, including state and federal agencies 
• 
Align local and state strategic planning efforts to promote regional interoperability needs are met 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Advanced Implementation 
Previously established communications policies and procedures from the area were incorporated into the 
TICP, thereby providing a solid basis for implementing the SOPs across the area.  These formalized SOPs 
are used regularly, and updates are frequently distributed to all public safety agencies.  The area has been 
practicing the interoperable communications aspects of the National Incident Management System 
(NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) for more than 1 year.  Despite some minor glitches in the area’s 
exercise (e.g., the ICS Form 205 was not updated throughout the exercise and the Communications Unit 
Leader was not clearly identified to the participating agencies), the exercise evaluators stated that the area 
generally performed well.  
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit 
implementation consistent with the TICP)   to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain 
and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance 
Usage: Advanced Implementation 
The area successfully demonstrated correct use of the available interoperable communications equipment 
(e.g., statewide radio caches, national shared channels, gateways, statewide system) during the TICP 
validation exercise.  For example, users demonstrated familiarity with set-up and effective use of cached 
radios after instruction by the radio cache manager.  The area also demonstrated strong participation from the

South Dakota employs a statewide very high frequency (VHF) digital trunked radio system that consists of tower sites 
across the state networked to a controller located in Pierre.  Roaming allows the user to traverse the state without losing 
communications, and the system allows individual agencies to maintain private communications with agency talk 
groups.  The digital aspects of the system allow for clear communications over 90 percent of the geographic area of the 
state, including Sioux Falls in Minnehaha County.  Lincoln County uses its own conventional ultra high frequency  
radio system.  Interoperability between Minnehaha and Lincoln counties is achieved by mobile repeaters and portable 
radios programmed on the statewide trunked system.  A backup conventional system is in place to allow conventional 
VHF radios access to the system via dispatcher-enabled console patch.  The metropolitan area uses a mixture of shared 
channels and talk groups, gateways, and cached radios to provide interoperability among regional first responders.

The Nashville area has established an Interoperability Committee within the Tennessee Homeland Security 
District 5 that is beginning to establish interoperability as a priority across the area.  The Interoperability 
Committee is a fairly new, ad hoc group that was established to develop the Tactical Interoperable 
Communications Plan (TICP).  The area’s officials stated that the area was formalizing agreements among 
the member agencies, but current partnerships were still primarily based on verbal agreements.  The 
continued development of documented agreements would support the formalization of these partnerships to 
ensure clear roles and responsibilities relating to communications interoperability issues and decisions.  A 
strategic plan for the area has been developed, but it has not yet been approved by the member agencies, 
making it difficult to determine whether area agencies are committed to carrying out the plan.  Fiscal support 
for the area’s interoperability efforts has come primarily through grant funding and does not address funding 
for recurring expenses (e.g., operations and maintenance).  It is not clear whether these funds are being used 
for priorities established by the regionwide governance group or whether long-term funding strategies have 
been developed.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Establish a committee charter and encourage formal membership to migrate to a decision-making group 
that includes all first responder agencies  
• 
Document and formalize the necessary agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding), to include local, 
state, and federal partnerships, to achieve regional interoperability 
• 
Encourage full review, approval, adoption, and acceptance of the strategic plan by all participants and 
attempt to align local and state strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are 
met 
• 
Encourage the development of a regional interoperability funding plan as part of the strategy, including 
long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) funding sources (in addition to grants)
