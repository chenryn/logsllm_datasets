User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Problems restoring file backed up on Windows using Duplicati to a Linux server running mono TL/DR version:

Mono + Duplicati.commandline.exe restore etc. etc. spits this out for several files regardless of what I try. I am able to list sets, list files in said sets, even do a verify, but each time i do a restore of any kind, i get errors to the effect of :


  Failed to restore file: "snapshot/blahblah/2005-11-07.tar.gz", Error
  message: The partial file record for
  snapshot/blahblah/2005-11-07.tar.gz does not match the file


Any advice here, or an idea of where to look for a better solution?

FULL STORY:

Ive recently put together an nice clean, friendly backup solution for several servers, predominantly Linux, but occasionally a windows box is added too. The solution as is meets all my requirements and does it well... save 1: cross-compatibility

The solution is based on a combination of several elements, but eventually comes done to using Duplicity and Duplicati for the actual storage of files. The entire solution was ready to go before i realized that Duplicati, does not, in fact allow me to restore my files to a Linux box, regardless of what the commandline under Mono might tell you. It just spits out errors on random zip and image files, for apparently no good reason as i have tried several options to get it to restore, and several versions of Mono including installing it pretty much lib-for-lib. There is no effective log file for the reasons for these errors, and even the "--debug-output=true" flag does nothing.

I am able to list sets, list files in said sets, even do a verify, but each time i do a restore of any kind, i get errors to the effect of :


  Failed to restore file: "snapshot/blahblah/2005-11-07.tar.gz", Error
  message: The partial file record for
  snapshot/blahblah/2005-11-07.tar.gz does not match the file


Now i could most likely use the friendly instructions on Duplicati's site and script a bash equivalent of the restore, but that's not exactly ideal. Any advice on this? or possibly an alternative solution that presents the same benefits of Duplicati/Duplicity but that actually works across platforms?

Assistant: This sounds like a problem with restoring a Windows made backup on a Linux machine.
The problem should be fixed in 1.3 beta (r1020), but the details are here:
