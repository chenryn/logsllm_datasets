Multi-radio devices provide end-users the ability to 
achieve ubiquitous and seamless connectivity anytime, 
anywhere  across  heterogeneous  networks.  Minimal 
service  disruption  while  a  device  roams  across 
networks  is  key  for  a  successful  deployment.  Today’s 
roaming decisions are reactive and traditionally based 
on  thresholds  for  signal  strength  or  other  radio 
properties,

introduces  an  Intel/BT  client 
architecture  to  support  seamless  mobility  for  multi-
radio  devices  and  proposes  a  novel  approach  to 
predict  when  a  device  needs  to  take  proactive  actions 
to  perform  handovers.  Significant  improvement  in 
reducing service discontinuity time is demonstrated by 
applying  our  approach  to  WiFi  and  WiMax  networks. 
We  also  validate  the  architecture  and  algorithm 
benefits  using  our  WiFi/WiMax  multi-radio  prototype 
in heterogeneous wireless network environments.  
1. Introduction 
With the introduction of multi-radio devices and the 
deployment  of  multiple  access  networks 
(WiFi, 
WiMax, GSM, etc), end-users are expecting ubiquitous 
connectivity  for  their  mobile  devices  and  expect  the 
devices  to  roam  seamlessly  across  networks  with  no 
service disruptions when using demanding applications.  
Supporting  seamless  mobility  across  networks  is  a 
challenging task for both the client and networks. 
On 
compliant  with 
the  network  side,  British  Telecom’s  21C 
Network  (BT  21CN)[11]  presents  one  solution  to 
provide  multi-access  networks  capabilities  through  an 
infrastructure 
International 
Telecommunication  Union’s  (ITU)  Telecoms  and 
Internet  Converged  Services  and  Protocols 
for 
Advanced  Networks 
[13].  BT  21CN 
supports  multi-access  technologies  and  the  required 
components  such  as  the  IP  multimedia  subsystem 
(IMS) [17] to support seamless handover and mobility 
across networks.   
(TISPAN) 
the 
On  the  client  side,  the  heterogeneous  network 
handover  process  can  be  classified  into  three  steps,  i) 
“when and why” should the device transition  to  a  new 
network,  ii)  “where”  should  the  device  transition  to, 
and  iii)  “how”  should  the  device  transition  between 
networks?    The  “when  and  why”  step  corresponds  to 
the triggering process when the mobile device receives 
an indication that it should operate on another network.  
This indication can be generated by external condition 
such as signal degradation or by device level condition 
such  as  critical  battery  level  requiring  a  switch  to  a 
more energy efficient network.  The “where” step is to 
select on which network to operate, either on the same 
network where a link layer transition is sufficient, or on 
a  heterogeneous  network  where  both  network  and 
session  service  transitions  need  to  be  performed.    The 
“how”  step  defines  the  execution  of  the  handover  and 
how  the  device  performs  the  transition,  e.g.  either 
doing  a  horizontal  handover  to  transition  to  the  same 
network  or  a  vertical  handover  to  different  networks. 
This paper focuses on the client side and addresses the 
“when and why” step. A companion work [4] addresses 
the  “where”  step,  and  a  SIP-based  solution  for  the 
“how” step has been discussed in [3]. 
forums 
industry 
There  are  currently  various  efforts  underway  in 
standard  organizations  and 
to 
standardize  heterogeneous  handovers,  including  IEEE 
802.21  [14]  and  3GPP  SA  WG2  [15].    For  instance, 
IEEE  802.21 
is  standardizing  a  set  of  media-
independent  handover  (MIH)  methods  and  procedures 
that  facilitate  mobility  management,  allowing  higher 
layer  services  or  applications  to  treat  all  access 
technologies  in  a  generic  manner.  It  specifies  three 
media-independent  services:  event  service,  command 
service,  and  information  service.  Events  may  indicate 
changes  in  state  and  transmission  behavior  of  the 
physical,  data  link  and  logical  link  layers,  or  predict 
state changes of these layers. The event service maps to 
the  triggers  in  the  “when  and  why”  step  mentioned 
above.  Events  defined  in  the  standard  include  Link-

upper  layer  entities,  such  as  Multi-radio  Connection 
Manager,  to  search  for  a  new  point  of  attachment 
before  the  current  one  ceases  to  carry  frames,  thus 
reduce the handover delays between attachment points.    
The  standard  organizations  define  syntax  and 
semantics  for  various  events/commands,  but  not  the 
algorithms  that  implement  these  events/commands,  for 
instance, the “intelligence” to decide when to initiate a 
handover.  Intel and BT have collaborated to prototype 
a  WiFi/WiMax  multi-radio  system  in  the  BT  21CN 
environment,  in  which  SIP  was  chosen  as  the  session 
mobility  protocol.    We  are  interested  in  the  overall 
performance  of  a  client-initiated,  network-assisted 
handover  using  SIP  for  a  WiFi/WiMax  multi-radio 
client  and  the  performance  improvements  in  reducing 
service  disruption  by  using  link  triggers  and  advanced 
prediction  algorithms.    Figure  1  shows  a  baseline 
measurement  on  a  generic  operating  system  without 
any  specific  optimization  of  the  delay  of  a  vertical 
handover.    It  also  shows  the  time  breakdown  when  a 
SIP Audio session is being transferred from a WiFi to a 
WiMax network after the WiFi signal degrades. (In this 
scenario  we  do  not  consider  authentication  to  the 
network).    Transferring  a  SIP  session  when  switching 
from  one  network 
involves  socket 
initialization,  network  address  acquisition  on  the  new 
interface, 
re-
registration  messages  for  old  and  new  interfaces 
respectively (binding update), and media redirection.

Based  on  our  measurements  it  takes  more  than  9 
seconds  from  the  time  WiFi  signal  is  lost  to  the  time 
the  SIP  client  is  able  to  re-establish  the  audio  session 
on the new interface. This includes the time it takes to 
detect  loss  of  connectivity  at  the  application  level  and 
establish  connection  on  the  new  interface,  assuming 
that 
include  any 
intelligence  to  proactively  detect  loss  of  connectivity. 
The measurements demonstrate that an early indication 
of LGD could help reduce or remove the gap between 
“WLAN 
to  “WiMax  Connect”,  and  hence 
significantly reduce the handover delay.

In  this  paper,  we  address  the  problem  of  providing 
accurate  and  predictive  link  layer  triggers  to  enable 
seamless  handovers,  horizontal  or  vertical,  and 
minimize service interruption.  In particular, we discuss 
how to  detect  link  status  changes  (e.g.  LGD)  and  how 
to accurately predict such changes. We propose a smart 
triggering  scheme,  which  includes  trigger  generation 
and  trigger  prediction.  Evaluation  based  on  real  WiFi 
and  WiMax  signal  traces  demonstrate  that  smart 
triggering is able to predict accurately and early in time.  
For instance, the WiFi  results  show  that  our  algorithm 
accurately  predicted  96%  of  LGD  triggers  and  on 
average, the prediction was made 1.1 seconds ahead of 
time.  Accurate  and  early  prediction  would  enable 
Connection  Manager  to  take  proactive  actions  and 
establish  alternative  connections  before  the  quality  of 
the current connection degrades to an  intolerable  level 
(e.g. long before “WLAN  lost”  in  Figure  1).  Once  the 
predicted LGD trigger is really generated, the necessity 
for a network handover is confirmed  and  the  on-going 
session  (e.g.  VoIP)  could  be  transferred  to  the  new 
connection, 
thus  minimize  or  eliminate  service 
interruption.  We  have  also

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. 
Section 2 presents our trigger generation algorithm and 
Section  3  presents  our  trigger  prediction  algorithm.  In 
Section  4,  we  evaluate  smart  triggering  in  WiFi  and 
WiMax networks. We discuss the Intel/BT multi-radio 
prototype  system  and  benefits  of  reducing  handover 
delays  by  applying  the  smart  triggering  scheme  in 
Section 5, and conclude in Section 6. 
2. Link trigger generation 
In  general,  link  layer  triggers  provide  a  mechanism 
to  monitor  and  detect  changes  in  link  quality  and  link 
parameters.  They  could  indicate  a  likely  loss  of  the 
current  network  connection  or  better  connectivity 
through  other  networks.    In  this  section,  we  discuss 
how to generate link triggers such as LGD, or in other 
words,  when  an  event  such  as  LGD  is  deemed  to 
happen.  In  the  next  section,  we  will  discuss  how  to 
predict such an event. 
Typically,  signal  strength  is  used  to  reflect  link 
quality  [7].  For  example,  in  WiFi  networks,  Received

Signal  Strength  Indication  (RSSI)  is  used,  while  in 
WiMax,  Carrier 
Interference-plus-Noise  Ratio 
(CINR) is used. In this paper, we focus our discussion 
on  RSSI  measurements.  The  same  algorithms  can  be 
applied to WiMax and other networks as well. Results 
from WiMax networks are discussed in Section 4.

In WiFi networks, handover from one AP to another 
is  typically  triggered  when  RSSI  is  lower  than  a  pre-
configured threshold. We follow this common practice 
to generate link layer triggers. According to [1], a RSSI

LD.  To  our  knowledge,  -76  is  a  commonly  used 
threshold to trigger handovers in WiFi networks. Thus, 
we choose -76 as the threshold for  LGD.  Table  1  lists 
the thresholds used for trigger generation in this paper. 
They  could  be  set  to  other  values  and  the  algorithms 
proposed  in  this  paper  are  independent  of  the  values. 
For  instance,  the  method  proposed  in  [6]  could  be 
applied to set the thresholds.

Due  to  shadowing  and  fading  effects,  the  radio

measurements (raw RSSI) fluctuate severely over time 
(more than 10dB normally). To address this problem, a 
smoothing  scheme  is  generally  applied  to  smooth  out 
raw  RSSI,  and  a  trigger  is  generated  when  the 
smoothed  RSSI  is  below  (or  above)  a  threshold. 
However,  when  raw  RSSI  fluctuates  a 
the 
smoothed  RSSI  also  goes  up  and  down,  which  could 
result  in  duplicated  triggers.  We  propose  a  simple 
optimization  to  reduce  duplicated  triggers,  the  Link-
status-update  method.    The  basic  idea  is  to  maintain 
the  state  of  the  link  status,  and  only  generates  triggers 
when link status changes (e.g. when link status changes 
to LGD, a LGD trigger is generated). The link status is 
updated in a conservative way, as shown in Table 2, in 
which the top row specifies the current smoothed RSSI, 
and  the  left  most  column  specifies  the  previous  link 
status. The other items define the next link status given 
the previous link status and the current smoothed RSSI. 
For instance, if the link status is  LGD,  then  unless  the 
smoothed  RSSI  goes  above  LCU_TH,  the  link  status 
will  not  change  (as  shown  in  the  4th  row).  Therefore, 
even  though  the  smoothed  RSSI  may  go  above  and 
below a threshold multiple times, no additional triggers 
will  be  generated  unless  signal  strength  goes  up  high 
enough.
