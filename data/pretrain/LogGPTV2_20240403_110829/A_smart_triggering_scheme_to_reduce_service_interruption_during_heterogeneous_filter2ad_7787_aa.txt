## Abstract
Multi-radio devices offer end-users the ability to achieve ubiquitous and seamless connectivity across heterogeneous networks. Minimizing service disruption while a device roams between networks is crucial for successful deployment. Current roaming decisions are typically reactive, based on signal strength or other radio properties, leading to undesirable handover delays. This paper introduces an Intel/BT client architecture to support seamless mobility for multi-radio devices and proposes a novel approach to predict when a device needs to take proactive actions to perform handovers. Significant improvements in reducing service discontinuity time are demonstrated by applying our approach to WiFi and WiMax networks. We also validate the architecture and algorithm benefits using our WiFi/WiMax multi-radio prototype in heterogeneous wireless network environments.

## 1. Introduction
With the introduction of multi-radio devices and the deployment of multiple access networks (WiFi, WiMax, GSM, etc.), end-users expect ubiquitous connectivity for their mobile devices, with seamless roaming across networks without service disruptions, especially when using demanding applications. Supporting seamless mobility across networks is a challenging task for both the client and the network.

On the network side, British Telecom’s 21C Network (BT 21CN) [11] presents one solution to provide multi-access network capabilities through an infrastructure compliant with the International Telecommunication Union’s (ITU) Telecoms and Internet Converged Services and Protocols for Advanced Networks (TISPAN) [13]. BT 21CN supports multi-access technologies and the required components such as the IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) [17] to support seamless handover and mobility across networks.

On the client side, the heterogeneous network handover process can be classified into three steps:
1. **When and Why**: The triggering process when the mobile device receives an indication that it should operate on another network.
2. **Where**: Selecting which network to operate on, either on the same network where a link layer transition is sufficient, or on a heterogeneous network where both network and session service transitions need to be performed.
3. **How**: Defining the execution of the handover, e.g., performing a horizontal handover to transition to the same network or a vertical handover to different networks.

This paper focuses on the client side and addresses the "when and why" step. Companion work [4] addresses the "where" step, and a SIP-based solution for the "how" step has been discussed in [3].

There are various efforts underway in standard organizations and industry forums to standardize heterogeneous handovers, including IEEE 802.21 [14] and 3GPP SA WG2 [15]. For instance, IEEE 802.21 is standardizing a set of media-independent handover (MIH) methods and procedures that facilitate mobility management, allowing higher-layer services or applications to treat all access technologies in a generic manner. It specifies three media-independent services: event service, command service, and information service. Events may indicate changes in state and transmission behavior of the physical, data link, and logical link layers, or predict state changes of these layers. The event service maps to the triggers in the "when and why" step mentioned above. Events defined in the standard include Link-Parameters-Change, Link-Up (LU), Link-Down (LD), Link-Going-Down (LGD), etc. LGD may be used by upper-layer entities, such as Multi-radio Connection Manager, to search for a new point of attachment before the current one ceases to carry frames, thus reducing handover delays between attachment points.

Standard organizations define syntax and semantics for various events/commands but not the algorithms that implement these events/commands, such as the "intelligence" to decide when to initiate a handover. Intel and BT have collaborated to prototype a WiFi/WiMax multi-radio system in the BT 21CN environment, where SIP was chosen as the session mobility protocol. We are interested in the overall performance of a client-initiated, network-assisted handover using SIP for a WiFi/WiMax multi-radio client and the performance improvements in reducing service disruption by using link triggers and advanced prediction algorithms.

Figure 1 shows a baseline measurement on a generic operating system without any specific optimization of the delay of a vertical handover. It also shows the time breakdown when a SIP Audio session is being transferred from a WiFi to a WiMax network after the WiFi signal degrades. (In this scenario, we do not consider authentication to the network). Transferring a SIP session when switching from one network to another involves socket initialization, network address acquisition on the new interface, sending SIP de-registration and re-registration messages for old and new interfaces respectively (binding update), and media redirection.

Based on our measurements, it takes more than 9 seconds from the time the WiFi signal is lost to the time the SIP client is able to re-establish the audio session on the new interface. This includes the time it takes to detect loss of connectivity at the application level and establish a connection on the new interface, assuming the SIP application does not include any intelligence to proactively detect loss of connectivity. The measurements demonstrate that an early indication of LGD could help reduce or remove the gap between "WLAN lost" and "WiMax Connect," significantly reducing the handover delay.

In this paper, we address the problem of providing accurate and predictive link layer triggers to enable seamless handovers, horizontal or vertical, and minimize service interruption. In particular, we discuss how to detect link status changes (e.g., LGD) and how to accurately predict such changes. We propose a smart triggering scheme, which includes trigger generation and trigger prediction. Evaluation based on real WiFi and WiMax signal traces demonstrates that smart triggering is able to predict accurately and early in time. For instance, the WiFi results show that our algorithm accurately predicted 96% of LGD triggers and, on average, the prediction was made 1.1 seconds ahead of time. Accurate and early prediction would enable the Connection Manager to take proactive actions and establish alternative connections before the quality of the current connection degrades to an intolerable level (e.g., long before "WLAN lost" in Figure 1). Once the predicted LGD trigger is generated, the necessity for a network handover is confirmed, and the ongoing session (e.g., VoIP) could be transferred to the new connection, thus minimizing or eliminating service interruption. We have also integrated the smart triggering scheme into our WiFi/WiMax multi-radio prototype system, and the results show that with smart triggering, network switching delay is dramatically reduced, supporting real-time communication. To the best of our knowledge, there are few works on predictions of link triggers. In [6], an analytical model is proposed to set appropriate thresholds for generating link triggers, but no evaluation on real signal strength traces was presented.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents our trigger generation algorithm, and Section 3 presents our trigger prediction algorithm. In Section 4, we evaluate smart triggering in WiFi and WiMax networks. We discuss the Intel/BT multi-radio prototype system and the benefits of reducing handover delays by applying the smart triggering scheme in Section 5, and conclude in Section 6.

## 2. Link Trigger Generation
In general, link layer triggers provide a mechanism to monitor and detect changes in link quality and link parameters. They could indicate a likely loss of the current network connection or better connectivity through other networks. In this section, we discuss how to generate link triggers such as LGD, or in other words, when an event such as LGD is deemed to happen. In the next section, we will discuss how to predict such an event.

Typically, signal strength is used to reflect link quality [7]. For example, in WiFi networks, Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) is used, while in WiMax, Carrier-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (CINR) is used. In this paper, we focus our discussion on RSSI measurements. The same algorithms can be applied to WiMax and other networks as well. Results from WiMax networks are discussed in Section 4.

### 2.1 Trigger Generation Method
In WiFi networks, handover from one AP to another is typically triggered when RSSI is lower than a pre-configured threshold. We follow this common practice to generate link layer triggers. According to [1], a RSSI value below -80 dBm corresponds to ineffective communication. Hence, we pick -80 dBm as the threshold for LD. To our knowledge, -76 dBm is a commonly used threshold to trigger handovers in WiFi networks. Thus, we choose -76 dBm as the threshold for LGD. Table 1 lists the thresholds used for trigger generation in this paper. These thresholds can be set to other values, and the algorithms proposed in this paper are independent of the values. For instance, the method proposed in [6] could be applied to set the thresholds.

| Trigger Type | Threshold (dBm) |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Link-Up (LU_TH) | -60 |
| Link-Coming-Up (LCU_TH) | -70 |
| Link-Going-Down (LGD_TH) | -76 |
| Link Down (LD_TH) | -80 |

**Table 1. Thresholds for trigger generation**

Due to shadowing and fading effects, the radio environment is highly time-varying, and RSSI measurements (raw RSSI) fluctuate severely over time (more than 10 dB normally). To address this problem, a smoothing scheme is generally applied to smooth out raw RSSI, and a trigger is generated when the smoothed RSSI is below (or above) a threshold. However, when raw RSSI fluctuates a lot, the smoothed RSSI also goes up and down, which could result in duplicated triggers. We propose a simple optimization to reduce duplicated triggers, the Link-status-update method. The basic idea is to maintain the state of the link status and only generate triggers when the link status changes (e.g., when the link status changes to LGD, an LGD trigger is generated). The link status is updated in a conservative way, as shown in Table 2, where the top row specifies the current smoothed RSSI, and the leftmost column specifies the previous link status. The other items define the next link status given the previous link status and the current smoothed RSSI. For instance, if the link status is LGD, then unless the smoothed RSSI goes above LCU_TH, the link status will not change (as shown in the 4th row). Therefore, even though the smoothed RSSI may go above and below a threshold multiple times, no additional triggers will be generated unless the signal strength goes up high enough.

| Smoothed RSSI | LU | LCU | LGD | LD |
|---------------|----|-----|-----|----|
| > LU_TH      | LU | LU  | LU  | LU |
| > LCU_TH     | LU | LCU | LCU | LCU|
| > LGD_TH     | LU | LCU | LGD | LGD|
| > LD_TH      | LU | LCU | LGD | LD |
| < LD_TH      | LU | LCU | LGD | LD |
