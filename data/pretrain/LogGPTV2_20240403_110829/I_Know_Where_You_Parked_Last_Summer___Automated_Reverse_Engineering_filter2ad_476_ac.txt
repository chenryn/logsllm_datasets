### Increasing the Receiving Range with LNA

The fundamental principle behind increasing the receiving range is that a Low-Noise Amplifier (LNA) amplifies the Received Signal Strength (RSS) of each packet, thereby enhancing the likelihood of successful decoding. As illustrated in Figure 7, the RSS of a meter located 15 meters from the eavesdropper was significantly improved when an LNA was used. The use of an LNA increased the receiving range by several multiples, allowing for the monitoring of meters at greater distances. While there are other methods to boost the eavesdropping range, our goal was to demonstrate that it can be achieved using inexpensive hardware.

### Number of Observed Meters

To measure the total number of observed meters, we employed two types of RF sniffers: a narrowband sniffer monitoring a 4 MHz frequency band and a wideband sniffer monitoring a 12.5 MHz band. The narrowband sniffer could detect packets from 72 meters without an LNA and 161 meters with an LNA. The wideband sniffer, on the other hand, could receive signals from 106 meters without an LNA and 485 meters with an LNA, which exceeds the total number of apartments in the neighborhood (408 units). We believe some of the observed meters are located in nearby regions.

### Packet Reception Rate

We evaluated the packet reception rate by measuring the number of received packets per hour (pph). A higher pph indicates more frequent updates on customer energy consumption, leading to a higher level of information leakage.

Our observations showed that while an LNA does enhance the eavesdropping range and the number of observed meters, it also reduces the packet reception rates for meters that could be heard without an LNA. For instance, a narrowband sniffer centered at 915 MHz typically captures about 30% of all transmissions (40 pph), as meters tend to transmit around this frequency. Without an LNA, we could receive an average of 6.65 pph per meter and a maximum of 27 pph. With an LNA, the average dropped to 3.96 pph per meter, though the maximum remained at 27 pph. The addition of the LNA undoubtedly increases co-channel interference (CCI), resulting in more packet collisions.

A wideband sniffer slightly improves both the average pph (7.03 pph) and the maximum pph (30 pph). The less-than-expected improvement is likely due to the increased likelihood of concurrent transmissions in different channels colliding. The detailed distribution of pph for all meters is depicted in Figure 8.

### Methods to Increase Received Packets

Several methods can be used to increase the number of received packets:

1. **Sophisticated Decoding Schemes**: Utilizing capturing effects, we can decode the strongest packet among collided ones if its RSS is significantly higher than others. Advanced signal processing techniques such as successive interference cancellation and multi-user detection, combined with multi-antenna techniques like beamforming and space-time adaptive processing, can further improve decoding.

2. **Monitoring the Entire Frequency Range**: A platform that monitors the entire frequency range can capture packets transmitted at all channels. However, this requires a powerful computer to process data at high rates and/or significant algorithm refinement to decode concurrent transmissions, which is beyond the scope of our current effort.

3. **Dedicated RF Sniffers**: A narrowband RF sniffer can hop through the same channel sequence as the target meter to receive packets. Our experiments show that such a sniffer could achieve 88.5 pph for a meter 10 meters away without an LNA.

### Neighborhood Monitoring

Wireless monitoring allows for the inconspicuous gathering of meter readings from a large number of homes. Using a cheap antenna and a low-cost LNA, we were able to obtain an hourly distribution of power consumption in the authors' neighborhood, as shown in Figure 9. Each bar in the figure represents 160Wh more consumption than the one to its immediate left.

For example, about 27 meters consumed less than 160Wh per hour on average, indicating that the corresponding apartment units were likely unoccupied during our experiments. This is an example of potentially sensitive information that can be easily obtained on a neighborhood scale. In this experiment, we were only able to receive a few pph for a large portion of meters. Methods to increase received packet rates are available and could provide finer granularity data and additional sensitive information from the neighborhood.

### Inferring Household Events

We now examine the extent to which detailed household activities and events can be inferred from the obtained data. The lower update rate of 30 seconds and high packet loss in neighborhood monitoring may suggest that this is more challenging.

Since no smart meters with fine-grained data are available in this neighborhood, we address this question by comparing our data with fine-grained data obtained from direct visual observation of the meter. To reduce manual labor, we implemented two automated visual observation mechanisms: one using cameras to monitor the meter's on-board LCD display and another using infrared (IR) photodiodes to detect IR LED flashes. These serve as baseline schemes for comparing the level of privacy risks caused by wireless sniffing.

#### Automated LCD Screen Monitoring

The LCD display shows the accumulated meter reading in digits with a resolution of 1 kiloWatt-hour (kWh) and the rate of consumption by a few 'dots' displayed on the corner of the LCD. These dots toggle in a sequence, appearing as a digital wheel spinning. Once one Watt-hour (Wh) is consumed, one of the dots toggles. Our camera-based monitoring system tracks these changes to generate an electricity consumption trace. In our experiments, we mounted the network camera 0.3 meters from the meter, set to 10 frames per second (fps), ensuring the recording of every dot flash unless the household consumes electricity at a rate higher than 18 kWh. With a higher-resolution camera, the setup can be placed at a hidden location further from the meter.

#### Infrared LED Monitoring

The IR LED on an electric meter flashes every time 1 Wh is consumed. To capture these flashes, we designed an IR sensing circuit (Figure 11). Without an IR signal, the output voltage of the low-power amplifier (LM324) remains constant. When the IR LED flashes, the photodiode detects the signal, and the amplifier outputs a pulse, which is then processed to generate the consumption trace.

By combining these methods, we can infer detailed household activities and events, highlighting the potential privacy risks associated with wireless meter reading.
