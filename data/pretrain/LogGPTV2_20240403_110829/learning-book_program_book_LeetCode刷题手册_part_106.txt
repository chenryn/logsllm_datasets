解题思路
·给出一个地图，1代表海水，0代表陆地。要求找出四周都是海水的陆地的总个数。
·这一题和第200题解题思路完全一致。只不过这一题要求必须四周都是海水，第200题的陆地可
以是靠着地图边缘的。在此题中，靠着地图边缘的陆地不能最终计数到结果中。

1266.MinimumTimeVisitingAllPoints
题目
On a plane there are n points with integer coordinates points [i] = [xi, yi] . Your task is to
find the minimum time in seconds to visit all points.
You can move accordling to the next rules:
● In one second always you can either move vertically, horizontally by one unit or dliagonally (it
means to move one unit vertically and one unit horizontally in one second).
● You have to visit the points in the same order as they appear in the array.

Input: points = [[1,1] , [3, 4] ,[1,0]]
Output: 7
Exp1anation: 0ne optimal path is [1,1] -> [2,2] -> [3,3] -> [3,4] -> [2,3] ->
[1,2] -> [0,1] -> [1,0]
