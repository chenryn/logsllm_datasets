to obtain an approximate gaussian distributed r.v. denoted as pi .
For Texas dataset, we found λ = −0.03, which is closer to zero.
Therefore, to simplify implementation, we used e(cid:29)ective λ = 0
for the transformation of both datasets in this paper. Note that our
proposed model does not require the data to be perfectly Gaussian.
We performed the above procedure for 3 subsets of smart meter
population sizes (see Fig. 3(a)) to prove topology invariance on the
Gaussianity. Hence, we validate the claim that, power consump-
tion of meters in a micro-grid can be approximated by a Gauss-
ian distribution. We also denote pi

t
power consumption report from each i on a power transformed
scale (since λ = 0) at any time slot and pmix denotes the aggre-
gate mixture. The transformation is done to exploit certain statisti-
cal properties exhibited by the Gaussian distributions. The extent
of Gaussianity is depicted through a Q-Q plot in Fig. 3(b). While
the Gaussian approximation resulted in 67% and 69% of the data-
points to be within the (cid:27)rst standard deviation (for texas and irish
datasets), the distributions remain unbalanced around the mean
with 64% of the total datapoints on the left and 36% on the right of
the mean on average. This asymmetry contributes to unique obser-
vations under orchestrated attacks as discussed in Section 5.1.1.

3.2 Gaussian Approximation of the Data
With an aim to ease mathematical tractability and exploit certain
known properties of Gaussian distributions, we seek to convert the
approximate lognormal distributions to an approximate Gaussian
distributions. For this, we use a (NIST recommended) power trans-
formation procedure [2] which is described by the following:
Given a data set d = {d1,d2 · · · ,dn}, where n denotes the total
number of data points, the power transformation of d is given by
d (λ) = {d1 (λ),· · · ,dn (λ)}, such that:
3.3 Time Domain Granularities
While real data is collected hourly (known as time slots t), we cal-
culate various consensus/anomaly detection metrics at the end of
a (cid:27)nite ‘time window’ (denoted by T ), that is a collection of l time
slots. Here, l depends on how (cid:27)ne or coarse grained monitoring is
desired. Let Tr e be the average time taken by customers to react
to the environmental factors that may trigger sudden legitimate
changes in power consumption in houses. For example, in warmer
sunny days during winter season, it is expected that most houses
would reduce heaters within some time Tr e  350W that is compared to existing works, and
derive conclusions on δav❕ required to evade detection.
Falsi(cid:27)cation Distribution: Additionally, we argue that the distri-
bution of δt within (δmin ,δmax ) should be some variant of uniform
distribution such that the resultant shape of power consumption
distribution remains unchanged, making it a smarter and less ob-
vious attack. In contrast, the e(cid:29)ect of normally distributed δt on
the resultant shape is quite apparent. A comparison between nor-
mally and uniformly distributed δt is shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b).
Note that, while our defense model works under both cases the re-
sults mostly consider variants of the uniformly distributed strategy.
Apart from this (a) Random strategy, the following falsi(cid:27)cation dis-
tributions are also possible: (b) Periodic: Targeting the dynamic
or time of use (TOU) electricity pricing [11], where attacks are
launched on speci(cid:27)c times when the price/demand of electricity
is high. We implemented a periodic strategy where attacks hap-
pen on every 12 hours in a day,(c) Incremental:
Instead of imme-
diately attacking with the intended δav❕, the adversary increases
its average falsi(cid:27)cation margins by a minuscule amount dδ on ev-
ery time slot till it reaches its intended δav❕. We implemented
an incremental strategy where dδ = 2W updated 4 hourly. (d)
Omission: No data reaches the utility since communication/data
is jammed/dropped. This is implemented by replacing data with
null values from a subset of meters.

5 PROPOSED FRAMEWORK
The proposed framework has two major parts: (a) Anomaly-driven
consensus correction model, and (b) Trust scoring model. The con-
sensus correction model provides robust consensus as inputs to the
proposed trust scoring model, which improves the classi(cid:27)cation.
5.1 Anomaly Driven Consensus Correction
The objective of the anomaly based consensus correction module
is to prevent the consensus measure (aggregate mean and standard
deviations) from getting too biased due to orchestrated attacks.
First, we show that the arithmetic mean is not a stable historical
invariant for aggregate power consumption. Therefore, historical
mean cannot be used as a consensus measure, and instantaneous
mean cannot be used since distinguishing legitimate changes in the
mean from malicious changes is di(cid:28)cult. The consensus correction
module has four phases: (i) proposed detection metric training, (ii)
inferring presence of organized falsi(cid:27)cation, (iii) detecting type of
falsi(cid:27)cation, and (iv) calculation of resilient consensus (resilient
mean and standard deviation (µM R and σM R ) in a time window.
5.1.1 Ratio of Harmonic to Arithmetic Mean. Now, we
show that the ratio of harmonic to arithmetic mean metric is bet-
ter than other consensus/aggregate based measures for anomaly
detection and consensus correction due to: (i) Higher invariance
to legitimate changes in consumption, (ii) Pythagorean mean spe-
cial asymmetry property facilitates attack detection.

Let pmix

All H Mt and AMt over the time window T are recorded, such
that the corresponding daily averages are given by H Mav❕ (T ) =
t =1 H Mt(cid:19)/24 and AMav❕ (T ) = (cid:18)P24
(cid:18)P24
t =1 AMt(cid:19)/24 over this win-
dow T (T is a daily window consisting of 24 time slots). Similarly,
let the average daily standard deviation be denoted as SDav❕ (T ) =
t =1 σt(cid:19)/24. Many prior works such as [14, 22, 24], propose the
(cid:18)P24
use of arithmetic mean or its derived smoothening statistics (such
as Cumulative Sum/Moving Averages of AMav❕ (T )) for sequential
anomaly detection. Thereafter, they propose to use historical mean
as a consensus in the event of an attack or the mean prior to the
attack detection. However, Fig. 5(a) shows how actual arithmetic
mean power consumption (cid:30)uctuates for the same time windows
for three years [25] in the Texas dataset without showing any re-
peating historical pattern or a stable time series. Due to high (cid:30)uc-
tuations of the instantaneous arithmetic mean, the error residual
between the derived smoothening statistic and the actual mean is
large. Thus, it will be di(cid:28)cult to identify legitimate changes from a
malicious one by monitoring the time series. It will also cause large
errors if historical arithmetic mean is used as a consensus. This is
evident from the high rates of false alarms and missed detection
reported in [7, 9]. To circumvent this problem, we propose to use
the ratio of H Mav❕ (T ) and AMav❕ (T ) as the detection metric by:
Q r at io
av ❕ (T ) =
H Mav ❕ (T )
AMav ❕ (T )
(3)
We denote µr at io and σr at io as the mean and standard deviation
of Qr at io
av❕ (T ) observed in the dataset. Let us explain three reasons
for choosing Eqn. 3, as a metric for detecting presence of attacks.
(i) High Invariance to Legitimate changes: From our experi-
mental study, we observed that the time series of Qr at io
av❕ (T ) sam-
ples over di(cid:29)erent years and across multiple datasets is highly sta-
ble over time in contrast to the time series of arithmetic mean
of power consumption. Fig. 5(b), shows the daily Qr at io
av❕ (T ) over
three di(cid:29)erent years (2014, 2015, 2016) for the Texas dataset, while
Fig. 6(a) shows the ratio Qr at io
av❕ (T ) for six di(cid:29)erent meter popu-
lations for a completely di(cid:29)erent AMI data set in Dublin, Ireland
during 2009-2010. Both, Figs. 5(b) and 6(a), prove that Qr at io
av❕ (T ) is
a highly stable invariant metric across di(cid:29)erent data sets, as com-
pared to the aggregate arithmetic means. Note that, Qr at io
av❕ (T ) can-
not exceed 1, due to the H M ≤ AM property [18].
av❕ (T ) also exhibits his-
torical stability over di(cid:29)erent years, unlike arithmetic mean which
shows large di(cid:29)erences in the readings on the same day in succes-
sive years. In fact, without using moving averages, the standard de-
viation of the ratio samples σr at io of Qr at io
av❕ (T ) is 0.017 and 0.012
for the Texas and Irish datasets respectively. Using a smoothening
Apart from the stability over time, Qr at io
moving average will further lower the standard deviation and pro-
duce a more stable invariant under normal conditions.
Additionally, higher the variance in the power consumption
dataset, the lesser is the mean of ratio sample distribution and vice-
versa. Hence, we conclude that the Qr at io
av❕ (T ) is a more robust
metric for anomaly detection than other typical measures such
as mean, mode, median due to its high invariance to legitimate
