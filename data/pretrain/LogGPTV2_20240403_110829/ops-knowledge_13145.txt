User: I'm a newbie to SCons and also using pydev. Can someone help me with instructions on how to debug scons scripts using Eclipse and pydev? Is it even possible considering the fact that SCons is a seperate app and not an extension to python?
Assistant: I'm not an Eclipse expert, but since you didn't get any other answer...
If you make the SCons source a part of the Eclipse project, and run the whole command from within Eclipse it should work like any Eclipse debugging. SCons is written in Python, there is no reason it shouldn't be debuggable in Eclipse just like anything else.
