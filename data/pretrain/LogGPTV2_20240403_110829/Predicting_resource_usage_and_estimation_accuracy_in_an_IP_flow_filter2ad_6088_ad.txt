4.2.6 Application and Examples
(cid:4)
The bound of Theorem 1(iii) is independent of any distribution
details of the ﬂow sizes themselves. This enables us to construct
simple bounds on estimator variance in term of average proper-
ties of ﬂows. We have tabulated the bound for the standard error
Var (cid:2)X/X in Table 2 for the case of no report loss: q = 1. For
comparison, we include a version of the same bound for q  N, so again the details of placement of
one packet will make little difference to subsequent results.
We note that another model for the distribution of packets has
been considered in [8], namely that packets in the original ﬂow
are evenly spaced with the mean interpacket separation, and that
packets are sampled periodically with random initial phase. In ex-
periments we have found that the model of this paper is, in most
cases, more accurate in predicting the average rate of production of
measured ﬂows.
5.3 Rate of Packet Sampled Flow Records
We now estimate the mean number of measured ﬂows produced
from an original ﬂow under sampling. We take interpacket timeout
as the only ﬂow termination mechanism. We ignore the possibility
of protocol-based termination, e.g. by observation of a TCP packet
with the FIN ﬂag set. On the other hand, only 1 in N of such
packets will be sampled on average, so termination by observation
of a FIN packet would be increasingly rare as N increases. We
also ignore ﬂow age as a criterion for termination. However, if
the unsampled ﬂows are measured ﬂows, their ages do not exceed
the allowed maximum. The same holds for a sampled ﬂow, since
its age cannot exceed that of the unsampled ﬂow from which it is
derived. Finally, we do not model termination for cache memory
management.
THEOREM 2. Let f (n, t; N, T ) denote the average number of
measured ﬂows produced from a single original ﬂow comprising n
packets randomly distributed over an interval of duration t, sam-
pled independently with probability 1/N, the measured ﬂows hav-
ing interpacket timeout T .

Theorem 2 can be used to estimates the rate of production of
sampled NetFlow records in the two settings mentioned above:
• Collected Unsampled Flow Records. Here we estimate the
average number of sampled ﬂows that would be produced
from a given set of unsampled ﬂows. consider m ﬂows col-
lected over an interval of duration τ , ﬂow i comprising ni
packets and having duration ti. The total rate of sampled
NetFlow records is estimated as
−1
R = τ
f (ni, ti; N, T )

i=1
• Modeled Distribution. The results could also be used in con-
junction with a model of ﬂow length distributions. Let r be
the arrival rate of original ﬂows. Let p(n, t) denote the model
probability that a given ﬂow comprises n packets distributed
over a duration t. Then the total rate of sampled NetFlow
records is estimated as
(cid:3)
R = r
p(n, t)f (n, t; N, T )
(11)
n,t
Note that (11) can be regarded as arising from averaging (10) over
a distribution of sample paths. However, since (10) is a sum over
ﬂows, it is not affected by correlations between ﬂows, hence only
the marginal distribution p(n, t) enters.
In a separate study we have compared the predictions of (10)
with values obtained from packet level traces subject to simulated
packet sampling and ﬂow formation.
In case examined, estima-
tion of the rate of packet sampled NetFlow records was accurate to
within 10%, and often closer, over a wide range of sampling rates
and ﬂow interpacket timeouts.
5.4 Applications
We see two applications of the above estimates (10) and (11) for
the mean rate of production of ﬂow records:
• Estimation from Unsampled Flows: unsampled ﬂow records
are used to predict the rate at which packet sampled ﬂow
records would be produced. In this case, N is the sampling
period for 1 in N packet sampling.
• Estimation from Sampled Flows for Decreased Sampling Rate:
sampled ﬂow records collected with 1 in M sampling are
used to predict the rate of production were records to be col-
lected with 1 in N M sampling for N > 1. In this case, N is
the factor by which the sampling period is to be increased.
6. PREDICTING THE PRODUCTION RATE
OF SMART SAMPLED FLOW RECORDS
In this section we show how to estimate the resources used by
the smart sampled ﬂow records at the collector. We focus on two
cases. In the ﬁrst, we estimate the output rate of ﬂow records from
smart sampling at the collector. This enables dimensioning of the
storage and/or transmission resources required to accommodate the
sampled records. In the second case, we consider further aggrega-
tion of the smart sampled ﬂow records, and estimate the number
of aggregate ﬂows that result. In applications we expect aggrega-
tion to be performed over successive time windows. The estimates
enable dimensioning of memory required for the aggregation table.
We perform these estimates in two ways. In Section 6.1 we de-
rive an upper bound based on aggregate characteristics of the in-
coming stream of ﬂow records. In Section 6.2 we obtain an esti-
mate based on the detailed statistics of measured ﬂows.
6.1 Smart Sampling Resources: Upper Bound
In the appendix we prove the following:
THEOREM 3. Consider a stream of ﬂow records arriving at av-
erage rate R, representing a data rate B. When this stream is
smart sampled with threshold z, the expected rate Rs at which ﬂows
records are produced is bounded above as
Rs ≤ min{R, B/z}.
(12)
Theorem 3 has two direct applications for the TAP architecture:
the output load of the smart sampler, and storage resources for ag-
gregation. In both cases B and z are the same: the data rate of
the trafﬁc being measured, and the sampling threshold respectively.
The rate of production R of ﬂow records from routers is to be de-
termined from the methods of Section 5.
6.1.1 Bounding Output Rate of the Smart Sampler
R is the average rate at which ﬂow records arrive at the smart
sampler, Rs bounds the average rate of production of smart sam-
pled ﬂow records.
6.1.2 Bounding Resources for Aggregation
In TAP, the smart sampled raw ﬂows are aggregated over a time
interval τ (e.g. over one hour). The key used to aggregate may be
the just the raw ﬂow key, or it may be coarser, e.g. a BGP routing
preﬁx. We want to estimate the number of aggregate ﬂows gener-
ated over the interval τ . Thus we want to determine the average
rate Rs,agg at which unique keys (at the desired aggregation level)
presented by ﬂows that survive smart sampling during the period of
length τ .
Clearly Rs,agg is bounded above by Rs (consider the case that
all keys are unique).
It must also be bounded above by the rate
Ragg, the average rate, over the interval, at which unique aggregate
keys become present in the NetFlow record prior to smart sampling.
Since Ragg ≤ R,
Rs,agg ≤ min{Ragg, B/z}.
(13)
6.2 Smart Sampling Resources: Estimate
We now obtain a more detailed estimate that allows us to deter-
mine how tight the bound of Theorem 3 is. Ideally such an estimate
would proceed by ﬁnding the distribution of the number and packet
and byte lengths of the measured ﬂows, then averaging the effect of
smart sampling over this distribution. However, such an approach is
computationally formidable; we opt instead for a simpler approach.
Consider raw ﬂows labeled by i having packet, duration and bytes
(ni, ti, bi), collected over a period of duration τ . Packet sampled
NetFlow yields on average f (ni, ti; N, T ) measured ﬂows. We ap-
ply these to the two examples for which bounds were obtained in
Section 6.1.
6.2.1 Estimating Output Rate of the Smart Sampler
Assume that b represented bytes are allocated evenly amongst
the average number fi = f (ni, ti; N, T ) of ﬂows. The expected
number of smart-sampled ﬂows that would arise from the original
ﬂow is fipz(bi/fi) = min{f, bi/z}. Thus we estimate the rate of
production of smart sampled ﬂow records by
