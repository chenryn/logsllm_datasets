[journald](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd-journald.service.html) is a system service designed to collect and store logging data. It creates and maintains structured, indexed journals based on logging information received from various sources, including:

- Kernel log messages via kmsg
- Simple system log messages via the `libc syslog` call
- Structured system log messages via the native Journal API
- Standard output and standard error of service units
- Audit records from the kernel audit subsystem

For each log message, journald automatically collects numerous metadata fields in a secure and unfakeable manner.

### Key Features

journald offers a robust out-of-the-box logging experience for systemd, with the following key features:

- **Indexing**: journald uses a binary storage format for logs, where data is indexed. This allows for much faster lookups compared to plain text files.
- **Structured Logging**: While structured logging is possible with syslog, it is enforced in journald. Combined with indexing, this enables easy filtering of specific logs (e.g., by priority or within a specific timeframe).
- **Access Control**: By default, storage files are split by user, with different permissions for each. Regular users can view their own logs but not those of other users or root.
- **Automatic Log Rotation**: You can configure journald to manage log retention based on space limits or available free space.

### Comparison with Syslog

While journald provides a comprehensive logging solution, some argue that syslog is more UNIX-like: it is more flexible and easier to integrate with other tools. The migration from syslog to journald was initially met with criticism, as not everyone agreed with the approach taken by systemd. However, systemd, along with journald, is now widely adopted by most Linux distributions.

journald can coexist with syslog daemons, as:
- Some syslog daemons can both read from and write to the journal.
- journald exposes the syslog API, allowing for compatibility with existing syslog-based systems.
