User: I am using linux mint, and to run a python file I have to type in the terminal: python [file path], so is there way to make the file executable, and make it run the python command automatically when I doublr click it?
And since I stopped dealing with windows ages ago, I wonder if the .py files there are also automatically executable or do I need some steps.
Thanks
Assistant: yes there is. add 
#!/usr/bin/env python 
to the beginning of the file and do 
chmod u+rx <file>
assuming your user owns the file, otherwise maybe adjust the group or world permissions.
.py files under windows are associated with python as the program to run when opening them just like MS word is run when opening a .docx for example.
