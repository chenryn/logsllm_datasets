User: Please design a data application based on RESTful API to provide weather forecast service for a certain city.
Assistant: The following is a data application based on RESTful API, which is used to provide a weather forecast service design for a certain city: 1. Determine the resources and endpoints of the API: - Current city weather forecast: /api/weather/current - Weather forecast for the next 24 hours : /api/weather/hourly - Weather forecast for the next 7 days: /api/weather/daily 2. Determine the HTTP request method supported by the API: - Get data: GET - Update data: PUT - Delete data: DELETE 3. Determine the API The format of the returned data: JSON 4. Define parameters for each endpoint: - latitude: the latitude of the query city - longitude: the longitude of the query city - unit: the unit of temperature (Celsius or Fahrenheit) - lang: the language of the returned data 5. Implementation of the development API: - Introduce the API of the third-party weather data API provider, and use the OAuth 2.0 authorization protocol to obtain permissions and access tokens. - Send requests and receive responses based on user requests, combining standardized query parameters with developer restrictions. - Parse the response data into JSON format, add required metadata, and return it to the user. 6. Test the API: - Use tools such as Postman or curl to test the API to check whether the response meets the expected results. - For any erroneous responses or exceptional conditions, return an appropriate HTTP status code and error message. 7. Publish API: - Publish the API document, and provide the access token and complete development environment required by the developer. - Provides documentation, sample code, and support features so developers can easily start using the API.
