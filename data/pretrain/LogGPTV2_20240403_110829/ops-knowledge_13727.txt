User: I would like to know how can I determine if a python script is executed from crontab?
I don't want a solution that will require adding a parameter because I want to be able to detect this even from an imported module (not the main script).
Assistant: Not quite what you asked, but maybe what you want is os.isatty(sys.stdout.fileno()), which tells if stdout is connected to (roughly speaking) a terminal. It will be false if you pipe the output to a file or another process, or if the process is run from cron.
