**Information Classification: General**

### Keyless Car Thefts on the Rise

- **Keyless entry car technology** now accounts for nearly 50% of all vehicle thefts. (UK Daily Mail, Jul 2021)
- **The risk of technology-enabled vehicle theft** will continue to increase. (Auto-ISAC Threat Assessment Report 2021)
- **Keyless entry/key fob** is one of the top two most common attack vectors. (Upstream Global Automotive Cybersecurity Report 2022)

### Threats Against Remote Keyless Entry Systems

- **Manipulation of key fob signals**
- **Signal jamming**
- **Relay (amplification) attacks**
- **Replay attacks**
- **Attacks on key management and cryptographic algorithms**
- **Key enrollment**
- **Key replacement**
- **Key extraction**

### Recent Car Hacks Based on Replay of Signals

(Additional details to be provided in the presentation.)

### Our New Findings: RollBack Attack

- **New replay attack**: RollBack
- **Unusual behavior**: More effective than previously known key fob replay attacks.
- **Initial discovery (Aug 2021)**: Unlocked a car by replaying two consecutive signals within 5 seconds.
- **Derived new generic attack metrics (Mar 2022)**: Works across different car makes and models, including:
  - Number of signals
  - Sequence
  - Interval
  - Instructions in the signal
- **Consistent with security assessments** by Thatcham Research – Consumer Security Ratings 2021.
- **Responsible disclosure**:
  - Notified key fob chip manufacturers in Apr 2022.
  - Shared findings with Auto-ISAC in May 2022.

### Rolling Codes: Brief Overview

- **Unique transmission**: Every key fob signal transmission is unique.
- **Counter synchronization**: Both the key fob and the vehicle maintain a counter that increments with each successful signal reception.
- **Future codes**: Provision is made if the key fob’s counter is "in the future" (e.g., buttons accidentally pressed but far from the vehicle).
- **Synchronization**: Upon successful reception, counters become re-synchronized.

---

### Rolling Codes in a Nutshell

- **Unique unlock signals**: "There are NO two unlock signals that are the same."
- **Counter increment**: Each time a button is pressed and a signal is received by the vehicle, both the key fob and the vehicle increase their counter for the next use.
- **Synchronization requirement**: If counters are in sync upon reception, the vehicle acts as instructed/expected.

### RollJam Attack

- **Signal Jamming + Capturing + Replaying**
- **Lure the owner**: Into a situation where "future codes" can be obtained easily.
- **Exploit safety feature**: Converts the safety provisioning feature into an exploit.
- **Difficulty in obtaining valid future codes**: In reality, it is extremely difficult to obtain valid "future codes."

### RollJam: Infamous Attack Against All Rolling Code-Based Systems

- **Proposed by Samy Kamkar in 2015**
- **Special-purpose small device**: Capable of capturing and replaying signals.
- **Difficulties in practical implementation**: Obtaining valid "future codes" is challenging.

---

### RollBack: Two Captured Signals

- **Setup similar to RollJam**: Capture + Jam* + Replay
- **First "unlock" signal**: Captured and jammed to hinder the car from receiving it.
- **Second "unlock" signal**: Captured only and let the vehicle receive it.
- **Vehicle acts as intended**: Owner uses the vehicle/key fob as usual.
- **Replay capability**: Attacker can replay the two consecutive "unlock" signals.
- **Note**: Some systems have more restrictions on replayed signals (details to be discussed later).

*RollBack does not necessitate jamming, but it can ease/fasten the signal capturing process.

---

### Why RollBack? Advantages

- **Rolling back to a previous code/state**: The captured consecutive signals are replayed.
- **Re-synchronization**: The vehicle re-synchronizes to a previous code, specifically to the old counters in the last replayed signal.
- **Vehicle actions**: Acts according to the instructions in the signals, i.e., unlocks.
- **Advantage over other attacks**: Simplifies the process of re-synchronization and reduces the need for complex setups.
