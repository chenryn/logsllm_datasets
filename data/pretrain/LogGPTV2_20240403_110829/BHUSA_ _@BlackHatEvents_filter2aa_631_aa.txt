Keyless car thefts have been on the rise
❏ Keyless entry car technology now accounts for nearly 50% of all 
vehicle thefts

❏ The risk of technology-enabled vehicle theft will continue to 
increase

Our new findings in a nutshell
❏ New replay attack - RollBack
❏ Revealed highly unusual behavior – more effective than 
previously known key fob replay attacks 
❏ Initial discovery in Aug 2021: unlocked a car by 
replaying two consecutive signals within 5 seconds
❏ Derived new generic attack metrics in Mar 2022 that 
work across different car makes & models: no. of 
signals, sequence, interval, instructions in the signal  
❏ Appear consistent with security assessments by 
Thatcham Research – Consumer Security Ratings 2021
❏ Responsible disclosure 
❏ Notiﬁed key fob chip manufacturers in Apr 2022
❏ Shared ﬁndings with Auto-ISAC in May 2022

Rolling codes
Brief overview of the operation
background
#BHUSA   @BlackHatEvents
Information Classification: General
❏ Note: provision is made if key fob’s counter is “in the future”
❏
Buttons accidentally pressed but far outside of the vehicle’s vicinity
❏
Upon successful reception, counters become re-synchronized again
❏ Every key fob signal transmission is unique
❏ “There are NO two unlock signals that are the same”
❏
Every time a button is pressed and a signal is received by the 
vehicle, both increase a counter for the next use
❏
If counters are in sync upon reception → vehicle acts as 
instructed/expected

❏ RollJam attack
❏
Signal Jamming + Capturing + Replaying
❏
Lure the owner into a situation where “future codes” can be 
obtained easily
❏ RollJam is/was not a “new hack” 
❏
it converts the safety provisioning feature into an exploit
Rolling codes - Straightforward “exploit”
❏ If an attacker can capture the signals of the accidental 
button presses outside of the vicinity of the vehicle
❏
We have the “future codes” → Straightforward “exploit”
❏ BUT: Obtaining valid “future code” in reality is extremely 
diﬃcult

Information Classification: General
RollBack - two captured signals
❏ Setup is similar to RollJam
❏
Capture + Jam* + Replay
❏ HOWEVER: RollBack is different
❏ First “unlock” signal sent
❏
Captured and jammed to hinder the car to receive it
❏ Second “unlock” signal sent (as a retry)
❏
Captured only and let the vehicle receive it
❏ Vehicle acts as intended
❏ Owner uses the vehicle/key fob as usual
❏
as many times s/he wants
❏ Attacker can replay the two consecutive “unlock” 
signals
❏
note: some system has more restrictions on the replayed signals 
(see later)
*RollBack does not necessitate jamming but it can ease/fasten the signal capturing process

Why RollBack? Advantages?
❏ Rolling back to a previous code/state 
❏
The captured consecutive signals are replayed
❏
The vehicle re-synchronize to a previous code
❏
To the old counters in the last replayed signal
❏
Vehicle acts according to the instruction in the signals
❏
i.e., unlocks
1. last unlock signal 
received
