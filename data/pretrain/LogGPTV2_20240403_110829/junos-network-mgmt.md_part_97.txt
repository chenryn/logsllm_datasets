Verifying That the Port-Mirroring Instance Has Been Correctly Created | 1209
To confirm that the configuration is working properly, perform these tasks:
Verifying That the Port-Mirroring Instance Has Been Correctly Created
Purpose
Verify that the port-mirror instance employee-web-monitor has been created on the switch with the
appropriate output VLAN.
Action
You can verify that the port-mirror is configured as expected by using the show forwarding-options port-
mirror command. To view previously created analyzers that are disabled, go to the J-Web interface.
To verify that the port-mirror is configured as expected while monitoring employee traffic on the source
switch, run the show forwarding-options port-miror command on the source switch. The following output is
displayed for this configuration example:
user@switch> show forwarding-options port-mirror
Instance Name: employee-web-monitor
Instance Id: 3
Input parameters:
1210
Rate : 1
Run-length : 0
Maximum-packet-length : 0
Output parameters:
Family State Destination Next-hop
ethernet-switching up default-switch/remote-analyzer
Meaning
This output shows that the employee-web-monitor instance has a ratio of 1 (mirroring every packet, which is
the default), the maximum size of the original packet that was mirrored (0 indicates the entire packet),
the state of the configuration is up (which indicates the proper state and that the analyzer is
programmed, is mirroring the traffic entering ge-0/0/0 and ge-0/0/1, and is sending the mirrored traffic
to the VLAN called remote-analyzer).

Filtering the Traffic Entering an Analyzer | 1213
1211
You use port mirroring to copy packets and send the copies to a device running an application such as a
network analyzer or intrusion detection application so that you can analyze traffic without delaying it.
You can mirror traffic entering or exiting a port or entering a VLAN, and you can send the copies to a
local access interface or to a VLAN through a trunk interface.
We recommend that you disable port mirroring when you are not using it. To avoid creating a
performance issue If you do enable port mirroring, we recommend that you select specific input
interfaces instead of using the all keyword. You can also limit the amount of mirrored traffic by using a
firewall filter.
NOTE: This task uses the Enhanced Layer 2 Software (ELS) configuration style. If your switch
runs software that does not support ELS, see Configuring Port Mirroring. For ELS details, see
Using the Enhanced Layer 2 Software CLI.
NOTE: If you want to create additional analyzers without deleting an existing analyzer, first
disable the existing analyzer by using the disable analyzer analyzer-name command.
NOTE: You must configure port mirroring output interfaces as family ethernet-switching.
Configuring Port Mirroring for Local Analysis
To mirror interface traffic to a local interface on the switch:
1. If you want to mirror traffic that is ingressing or egressing specific interfaces, choose a name for the
port-mirroring configuration and configure what traffic should be mirrored by specifying the
interfaces and direction of traffic:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer analyzer-name input (ingress | egress) interface interface-name
NOTE: If you configure Junos OS to mirror egress packets, do not configure more than 2000
VLANs. If you do so, some VLAN packets might contain incorrect VLAN IDs.
1212
NOTE: If you configure mirroring for packets that egress an access interface, the original
packets lose any VLAN tags when they exit the access interface, but the mirrored (copied)
packets retain the VLAN tags when they are sent to the analyzer system.
2. If you want to specify that all traffic entering a VLAN should be mirrored, choose a name for the
port-mirroring configuration and specify the VLAN:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer analyzer-name input ingress vlan vlan-name
NOTE: You cannot configure port mirroring to copy traffic that egresses a VLAN.
3. Configure the destination interface for the mirrored packets:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer analyzer-name output interface interface-name
Configuring Port Mirroring for Remote Analysis
To mirror traffic to a VLAN for analysis at a remote location:
1. Configure a VLAN to carry the mirrored traffic:
[edit]
user@switch# set vlans vlan-name vlan-id number
2. Configure the interface that connects to another switch (the uplink interface) to trunk mode and
associate it with the appropriate VLAN:
[edit]
user@switch# set interfaces interface-name unit 0 family ethernet-switching port-mode trunk
vlan members (vlan-name | vlan-id)
3. Configure the analyzer:
1213
a. Choose a name for the analyzer:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer analyzer-name
b. Specify the interface to be mirrored and whether the traffic should be mirrored on ingress or
egress:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer analyzer-name input (ingress | egress) interface interface-name
c. Specify the appropriate IP address or VLAN as the output (a VLAN is specified in this example:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer analyzer-name output vlan (vlan-name | vlan-id)
If you specify an IP address as the output, note the following constraints:
• The address cannot be in the same subnetwork as any of the switch management interfaces.
• If you create virtual routing instances and also create an analyzer configuration that includes
an output IP address, the output address belongs to the default virtual routing instance (inet.0
routing table).
• The analyzer device must be able to de-encapsulate GRE-encapsulated packets, or the GRE-
encapsulated packets must be de-encapsulated before reaching the analyzer device. (You can
use a network sniffer to de-encapsulate the packets.)
Filtering the Traffic Entering an Analyzer
NOTE: This functionality is not supported on NFX150 devices.
In addition to specifying which traffic to mirror by configuring an analyzer, you can also use a firewall
filter to exercise more control over which packets are copied. For example, you might use a filter to
specify that only traffic from certain applications be mirrored. The filter can use any of the available
match conditions and must have an action of modifier of port-mirror-instance instance-name. If you use the
same analyzer in multiple filters or terms, the output packets are copied only once.
When you use a firewall filter as the input to a port-mirroring instance, you send the copied traffic to a
local interface or a VLAN just as you do when a firewall is not involved.
1214
To configure port mirroring with filters:
1. Configure a port-mirroring instance for local or remote analysis. Configure only the output. For
example, for local analysis enter:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set port-mirroring-instance instance-name output interface interface-name
NOTE: You cannot configure input to this instance.
2. Create a firewall filter using any of the available match conditions. In a then term, specify include the
action modifier port-mirror-instance instance-name.
3. Apply the firewall filter to the interfaces or VLAN that should provide the input to the analyzer:
[edit]
user@switch# set interfaces interface-name unit 0 family ethernet-switching filter input
filter-name
[edit]
user@switch# set vlan (vlan-name | vlan-id) filter input filter-name
RELATED DOCUMENTATION
Overview of Firewall Filters (QFX Series)
Configuring Port Mirroring on SRX Series Firewalls
To configure port mirroring on an SRX device, you must first configure the forwarding-options and
interfaces at the [edit] hierarchy level.
You must configure the forwarding-options statement to define an instance of the mirror-to port for port
mirroring and also configure the interface to be mirrored.
NOTE: The mirrored port and the mirror-to port must be under the same Broadcom chipset in an
I/O card.
To configure port mirroring:
1215
1. Specify the rate and run-length at the [edit forwarding-options port-mirroring input] hierarchy level:
NOTE:
• rate: Ratio of packets to be sampled (1 out of N) (1 through 65535)
• run-length: Number of samples after initial trigger (0 through 20)
[edit]
forwarding-options
port-mirroring {
input {
rate number;
run-length number;
}
}
2. To send the copies of the packet to the mirror-to port, include the interface intf-name statement at the
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring family any output] hierarchy level.
output {
interface intf-name;
}
NOTE: Port mirroring on SRX Series Firewalls uses family any to transfer the mirror-to port
information to the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE). The mirroring engine copies all the
packets from mirrored port to the mirror-to port.
NOTE: You can configure an instance clause to specify multiple mirror-to ports.
To mirror an interface, include the port-mirror-instance statement at the [edit interface mirrored-
intf-name] hierarchy level.
The mirrored interface is configured with an instance name, defined in the forwarding-options. The
mirrored port and the mirror-to port are linked through that instance.

Use port mirroring to send traffic to applications that analyze traffic for purposes such as monitoring
compliance, enforcing policies, detecting intrusions, monitoring and predicting traffic patterns,
correlating events, and so on. Port mirroring copies packets entering or exiting an interface or entering a
VLAN and sends the copies to a local interface for local monitoring.

details, see Using the Enhanced Layer 2 Software CLI.
This example describes how to configure port mirroring to copy traffic sent by employee computers to a
switch to an access interface on the same switch.

Requirements
This example uses the following hardware and software components:
• Junos OS Release 13.2
• A switch
Overview and Topology
IN THIS SECTION
Topology | 1218
This topic includes two related examples that describe how to mirror traffic entering interfaces on the
switch to an access interface on the same switch. The first example shows how to mirror all traffic sent
by employee computers to the switch. The second example includes a filter to mirror only the employee
traffic going to the Web.
Topology
In this example, xe-0/0/0 and xe-0/0/6 serve as connections for employee computers. Interface xe-0/0/47 is
connected to a device running an analyzer application.
NOTE: Multiple ports mirrored to one interface can cause buffer overflow and dropped packets.

Procedure | 1219
To configure port mirroring for all traffic sent by employee computers for local analysis, perform the
tasks explained in this section.
Procedure
CLI Quick Configuration
To quickly configure local port mirroring for ingress traffic to the two ports connected to employee
computers, copy the following commands and paste them into a switch terminal window:
[edit]
set interfaces xe-0/0/0 unit 0 family ethernet-switching
set interfaces xe-0/0/6 unit 0 family ethernet-switching
set interfaces xe-0/0/47 unit 0 family ethernet-switching

set forwarding-options analyzer employee-monitor input ingress interface xe-0/0/6.0
set forwarding-options analyzer employee-monitor output interface xe-0/0/47.0
Step-by-Step Procedure
To configure an analyzer called employee-monitor and specify the input (source) interfaces and the output
interface:
1. Configure the interfaces connected to employee computers as input interfaces for the port-mirror
analyzer employee-monitor:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input ingress interface xe–0/0/0.0
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input ingress interface xe–0/0/6.0
2. Configure the output analyzer interface for the employee-monitor analyzer. This will be the destination
interface for the mirrored packets:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor output interface xe-0/0/47.0
Results
Check the results of the configuration:
[edit]
user@switch# show forwarding-options analyzer
employee-monitor {
input {
ingress {
interface xe-0/0/0.0;
interface xe-0/0/6.0;
}
}
output {
interface {
xe-0/0/47.0;
}

Overview
Rather than mirror all traffic, it is usually desirable to mirror only certain traffic. This is a more efficient
use of your bandwidth and hardware and might be necessary due to constraints on these assets. To
select specific traffic for mirroring, you use a firewall filter to match the desired traffic and direct it to a
port-mirroring instance. The port-mirroring instance then copies the packets and sends them to the
output VLAN, interface, or IP address.
