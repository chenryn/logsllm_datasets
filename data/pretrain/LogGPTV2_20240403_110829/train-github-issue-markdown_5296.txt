When using Firefox 22.0 on a MacBook Pro and navigating to the following URL:
<http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/components/>

I noticed that the Scrollspy functionality is working as expected. However, when I click on an item in the side navigation, the error console displays the following message:

```
An empty string is passed to GetElementById()
```

Thank you for your attention.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
