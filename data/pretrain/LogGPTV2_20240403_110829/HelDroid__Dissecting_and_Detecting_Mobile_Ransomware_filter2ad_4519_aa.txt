## Abstract
Ransomware attacks primarily target human users, unlike traditional malware that exploits infected devices (e.g., botnets, information theft). Mobile devices are not immune to ransomware, yet there is limited research in this area, and only conventional protections are available. State-of-the-art mobile malware detection methods are ineffective against ransomware due to its subtle attack mechanisms, leaving a vast attack surface of billions of mobile devices unprotected.

In this work, we first summarize the characteristics of existing mobile ransomware families. Second, we introduce HelDroid, a fast, efficient, and fully automated approach for detecting both known and unknown scareware and ransomware samples. HelDroid identifies the "building blocks" typically used in mobile ransomware, such as unauthorized device locking or encryption and ransom request displays. Our technique does not require prior knowledge of specific ransomware families.

We implemented and tested HelDroid on real-world Android ransomware samples. On a large dataset of hundreds of thousands of APKs, including goodware, malware, scareware, and ransomware, HelDroid demonstrated nearly zero false positives and the ability to recognize unknown ransomware samples.

## 1. Introduction
Ransomware, theorized in 1996 [1], has now become a significant threat. A typical ransomware attack encrypts files on a victim's device and demands a ransom for their release. Attackers use various extortion tactics, which can range from simply locking the device to encrypting personal data. Even if the malware is removed, victims often have no choice but to pay the ransom to regain access to their data.

McAfee Labs [2] and the FBI [3] have reported that ransomware is on the rise and will be among the top five most dangerous threats in the near future. In parallel, mobile malware is growing rapidly, with McAfee Labs reporting a 100% increase in Q4 2014 compared to Q4 2013 [2, p.28]. Unfortunately, mobile devices are not immune to ransomware. A notable campaign infected over 900,000 mobile devices in a single month [4]. Kaspersky Labs [5] also tracked a well-structured distribution network targeting mobile users.

Given the wide attack surface and the sensitive data stored on mobile devices, there is an urgent need for mobile-specific ransomware countermeasures. Our goal is to make a first step in this direction.

### Current Solutions
To our knowledge, current mitigations are commercial cleanup utilities using signature-based approaches. For example, SurfRight’s HitmanPro.Kickstart [6] is a bootable USB image that uses live-forensics to detect known ransomware. Other tools like Avast’s Ransomware Removal [7] (for Android) exploit the design flaws of certain ransomware families to recover the encryption key. However, these approaches lack generality, are limited to known samples, and are easily evaded by new variants.

### Research Gap
No research has specifically addressed mobile ransomware. Even state-of-the-art detection methods, which are effective against non-ransomware malware, have low recall rates for ransomware. This is because ransomware schemes are essentially mimicry attacks, where malicious behavior is a combination of legitimate actions.

### Proposed Approach
After analyzing multiple Android ransomware samples, we identified distinctive features of ransomware tactics. Our approach, HelDroid, determines whether a mobile application attempts to threaten the user, lock the device, or encrypt data. HelDroid uses static taint analysis and lightweight emulation to detect device-locking and file-encryption behaviors. It also employs a learning-based natural language processing (NLP) technique to recognize threatening text. While most of the analysis is static, the NLP detector can execute the sample if no threatening text is found statically, supporting off-band text (e.g., fetched from a remote server).

HelDroid is specific to ransomware but adaptable to future families. The detection features are parametric and can be updated easily.

### Evaluation Results
We tested HelDroid on a large dataset of hundreds of thousands of samples, including goodware, generic malware, and ransomware. HelDroid correctly detected all ransomware samples and had a very low false positive rate. It also performed well against unknown ransomware, missing only a few cases where the language was not supported. These issues were easily resolved with minimal retraining.

### Prototype Release
We provide access to HelDroid through an API and a simple Android client. Our dataset is available for research purposes at http://ransom.mobi.

### Original Contributions
- We are the first to comprehensively analyze mobile ransomware, providing a retrospective view and distinguishing characteristics.
- We propose three generic indicators of compromise for detecting Android ransomware, including a text classifier based on NLP, a lightweight Smali emulation technique, and taint tracking for file-encrypting flows.
- We implement and evaluate our approach for the Android platform and release it as a JSON-based API service over HTTP, making it the first public research prototype of its kind.

## 2. Background and Motivation
The concept of using cryptography for extortion was first introduced in 1996 [1]. Ransomware can be seen as an advanced form of cryptovirus, employing coercion techniques such as threatening the victim with legal action or encrypting data until a ransom is paid. Digital currencies like Bitcoin have become a common payment method for ransomware.

### 2.1 Motivation
Noticing the rapid emergence of new mobile ransomware families, we reverse-engineered samples and identified three common characteristics: device locking, data encryption, and threatening text. These characteristics can be combined to categorize samples as scareware, ransomware, or neither.

### 2.2 Goals and Challenges
Our goal is to develop a robust model that can detect both known and novel ransomware variants, overcoming the limitations of signature-based approaches. This requires a generalizable and adaptive model, especially for recognizing threatening text in different languages.

### 2.3 Scope and Assumptions
We focus on Android ransomware, which is evolving quickly with five families emerging in less than a year. We address challenges unique to ransomware detection, such as detecting locking strategies, encryption operations, and threatening messages.

## 3. HELDROID’s Approach
HelDroid analyzes each Android APK file using three independent detectors: Threatening Text Detector, Encryption Detector, and Locking Detector. These detectors look for specific indicators of compromise typical of ransomware. If the Threatening Text Detector is positive but the others are not, the sample is labeled as scareware. If any of the other detectors are also positive, the sample is labeled as ransomware.

### 3.1 Threatening Text Detector
This detector uses NLP to classify text as threatening or not. If no threatening text is found statically, the sample is executed in an instrumented sandbox to analyze dynamically allocated strings.

### 3.2 Encryption Detector
This detector uses static taint analysis to identify file-encrypting flows. It looks for function calls that indicate encryption operations.

### 3.3 Locking Detector
This detector uses lightweight Smali emulation to detect device-locking strategies, such as requesting device-administration rights or trapping key events.

By combining the results of these detectors, HelDroid can accurately identify and categorize ransomware and scareware samples.
