User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题My /var/log/btmp file is huge! What should I do? My /var/log/btmp file is 1.3 GB in size. I've read that the file is "Used to store information about failed login".

What does this mean for my server? And can I delete this file?

Assistant: This means people are trying to brute-force your passwords (common on any public-facing server).

It shouldn't cause any harm to clear out this file.

One way to reduce this is to change the port for SSH from 22 to something arbitrary. For some additional security, DenyHosts can block login attempts after a certain number of failures. I'd highly recommend installing and configuring it.
