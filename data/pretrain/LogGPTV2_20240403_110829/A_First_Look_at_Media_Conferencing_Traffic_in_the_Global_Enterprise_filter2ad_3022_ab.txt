Fig. 3. Call traﬃc seen at a typical media aggregator
lead to poor call quality, including network-speciﬁc factors like packet loss, jit-
ter, delay, but also application-speciﬁc factors such as audio echo, codec bitrate
and frame loss rates. While Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) do help diﬀerentiate
poor calls from acceptable ones, we ﬁnd that max packet loss is one important
contributor to poor calls from the network standpoint. In this dataset, packet
loss is calculated over time intervals of 30 seconds during the call, with the max-
imum packet loss interval logged at the end of the call. Max packet loss is a good
indicator of a poor call because even a single moment of high packet loss can
distract callers and lead to a poor opinion of call quality. To this end, we focus
on identifying the cause of, and potential remedies for high packet loss.
Wireless Last-Hop: While enterprise networks are often comprised of desktop
and server machines on wired LANs, a signiﬁcant number of hosts in the large
enterprise we study actively use wireless LANs, a trend that is likely to increase
given advancements in wireless deployments and ease of use. Much research has
focused on the interplay between VoIP and 802.11-based wireless access, noting
poor VoIP call quality on these wireless deployments despite having suﬃcient
bandwidth capacity [4, 5]. In Figure 4(a), we plot the CDF of max packet loss,
distinguishing between streams with endpoints communicating over wireless last
hops. Streams involving wireless experience much worse packet loss characteris-
tics than those on wired connections. For example, 5-10% of streams experience
packet loss rates above 4%, producing poor audio quality and yielding a very
poor user experience for those using video conferencing on these wireless de-
vices. Although calls where both endpoints are wireless tend to be worse than
with just one wireless endpoint, the marked diﬀerence is between wireless and
non-wireless calls.
Coarse packet loss statistics alone do not tell the entire story. Most telephony
and conferencing protocols are also sensitive to the duration of packet loss bursts,
the length of time for which a large fraction of packets are discarded because
of delayed arrival. As shown in Figure 4(b), audio streams with at least one
wireless endpoint experience more and longer burst durations on average than
wired connections. Thus, even if the wireless streams do not drop packets, the
packets that do arrive may be useless to the real-time application.

Given the prevalence of (IEEE 802.11-based) wireless users (e.g., those with
laptops in conference rooms), these real-world results motivate the need for de-
ployment of newer VoIP and conferencing protocols that can accommodate such
high-loss rates and minimize burst without a large degradation in call quality.
Home Users and VPN Clients: While calls within the enterprise experience
higher than expected packet loss rates, we compare intra-enterprise calls to those
calls that transit part of the public Internet to better understand whether the
issue is speciﬁc to this enterprise network. Figure 5 plots the CDF of packet loss,
separating in-enterprise endpoints and VPN/home endpoints. While packet loss
within the enterprise is higher than expected, packet loss for VPN and home
users is very high: 5% of streams experience packet loss rates greater than 10%.
This suggests that the enterprise network is indeed better provisioned than the
public Internet, though may not be as underutilized as previously noted [1]. We
also observe that for external users, the call quality is perceivably better over the
public Internet than over VPN. For example, an additional 10% of VPN streams
experience packet loss of 5% or higher than public Internet streams. This can be
attributed to VPN servers not adequately handling voice traﬃc, since they were
designed with email/corporate-intranet traﬃc in mind.
Without packet-level traces or other data-traﬃc originating from or termi-
nating at those endpoints, it is diﬃcult to conjecture why these rates are much
higher and more prevalent across the public Internet. For example, these higher
loss rates may be caused by network congestion at the endpoint’s ISP, wireless
packet loss at the home user’s network, or local congestion with other bulk data
traﬃc from the endpoint itself.
QoS and Voice VLAN Usage: Most IP phone deployments are conﬁgured to
exist on a separate voice VLAN [6]. Packets sent from the IP phone are marked
with prioritized DiﬀServ DSCP [3] bits. Core routers within the enterprise and
outgoing inter-branch oﬃce interfaces prioritize this voice VLAN traﬃc over
normal best-eﬀort data traﬃc. In Figure 6(a), we plot the CDF of the max packet
loss fraction broken down based on whether zero, one, or both endpoints exist on

Max Packet Loss Fraction
Fig. 5. Maximum packet loss CDF depending on type of user: within enterprise, ex-
ternal over public Internet (home), and external over VPN
the voice VLAN. In this graph, we remove calls that involve wireless endpoints
to focus on the beneﬁts of QoS on the wired LAN. Further, we remove endpoints
outside the enterprise network (e.g., calls from employee homes, through VPNs)
to avoid paths that traverse the public Internet, which does not respect DiﬀServ
priority.
When both endpoints are on the voice VLAN, nearly all calls experience less
than 2% packet loss, a loss rate that most audio codecs can accommodate. When
exactly one endpoint is on the voice VLAN, max packet loss increases: 25% of
audio streams exhibit some non-negligible packet loss. However, most calls do
not experience more than 4% packet loss. When neither endpoint is on the voice
VLAN, we ﬁnd that 2% of streams experience packet loss rates greater than
4%. These results suggest that QoS for voice traﬃc can mostly eliminate the
prevalence of poor audio calls due to packet loss in the wired enterprise.

Because QoS is more likely to help on congested paths, we further break
down packet loss characteristics based on whether the call traverses an inter-
oﬃce branch link or remains within the same branch oﬃce in Figure 6(b). Given
the same QoS capability, packet loss rates on intra-branch paths are lower than
on inter-branch paths, suggesting that inter-branch paths are likely bottlenecked
at a common chokepoint. Interestingly, inter-branch oﬃce calls with QoS enabled
tend to perform better than intra-branch oﬃce calls without QoS: there is enough
congestion within a single site that intra-branch calls without QoS can suﬀer
more than prioritized inter-branch calls. Thus, even the assumption that single
sites are well-provisioned within an enterprise network may not be true.
5 Related Work
Measurement studies of enterprise networks have, up until recently, been scarce,
despite the growth of the enterprise sector within industry. In the past decade,
Shaikh et al. studied OSPF behavior in an enterprise network [7], and Pang et
al. provided traﬃc analysis of a modern, medium-sized enterprise network, focus-
ing on categorizing the types of traﬃc and network behavior seen in the enter-
prise based on packet traces [1]. Recent studies have also focused on enterprise
network management [8], troubleshooting [9], or wireless diagnosis [10]. More re-
cently, Guha et. al identify mobile (often oﬀ-site) hosts for degraded “health” in
enterprise networks, where health is deﬁned as the fraction of useful ﬂows [11].
Our paper looks away from operational aspects of enterprise networks and
instead attempts to shed light on an important and growing class of traﬃc within
the modern enterprise: VoIP and conferencing. In addition, we provide a ﬁrst
look into a new class of modern enterprise networks that spans the globe and
is heterogeneous in connectivity, making such networks more like the wide-area
Internet in scope.
6 Conclusion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work in the literature to measure
and analyze media traﬃc in the global enterprise. Using session-level reports
logged at the end of each call containing call quality and network statistics,
we quantify the impact on call quality for a range of factors in the enterprise,
including wired vs. wireless access, inter- vs. intra- branch oﬃce communication,
QoS mechanisms like VLAN tagging and DiﬀServ DSCP marking, and VPN
vs. public Internet access. With the modern enterprise spanning the globe, the
transitioning to VoIP from PBX, and rich media applications like voice and
video conferencing seeing explosive growth in the enterprise, it can no longer be
assumed that bandwidth is “abundant” in the enterprise. Our studies indicate
that careful network planning and provisioning may be required in the enterprise
to support good quality for media applications and that QoS mechanisms for
prioritized traﬃc handling do indeed help to improve quality. Our continuing
work in this area involves further analysis of media traﬃc in the enterprise using
packet level traces and active measurement.
