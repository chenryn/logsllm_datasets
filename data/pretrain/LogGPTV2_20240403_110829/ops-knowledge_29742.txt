User: The version of Linux I am working on has python 2.6 by default, and we installed 2.7 on it in a separate folder. 
If I want to run a .py script, how do I tell it to use 2.7 instead of the default?
Assistant: Use update-alternatives --config python and shoose python2.7 from choices.
If you need to remove it use update-alternatives --remove python /usr/bin/python2.7.
