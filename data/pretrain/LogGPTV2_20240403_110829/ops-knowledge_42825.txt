User:  Please describe what network topology is, and introduce the common star, bus and ring topologies respectively.
Assistant: Network topology refers to the structural form in which each node (computer, device) in the network is connected and composed. It describes the connection mode and data flow direction between devices in the network, which is helpful for network management and maintenance. Three common network topologies are as follows: 1. Star topology The star topology takes the central node as the core, and directly connects each terminal device to the central node. The central node not only transmits data, but also is responsible for network management and maintenance. The advantage is that it is easy to manage and expand, and the disadvantage is that it is highly dependent on the central node. Once the central node fails, the entire network will stop working. 2. Bus-type topology The bus-type topology connects all devices through the main line, and each node can directly perform data transmission and communication on the main line. The advantage is that the connection method is simple and the cost is low, but when the main line fails or the network is overloaded, the entire network will be paralyzed, and maintenance and management are difficult. 3. Ring topology In ring topology, devices are connected into a ring, and each device is connected to two adjacent devices on the left and right to form a closed ring network. In a ring network, data flows continuously in a specific direction. The advantage is that resources are fully utilized and the failure rate is low, but when a node fails or a device is disconnected midway, the entire network may stop working.
