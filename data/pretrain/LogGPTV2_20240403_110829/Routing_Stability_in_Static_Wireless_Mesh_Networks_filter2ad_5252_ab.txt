### Observations on Dual-Radio Mesh Networks

In our analysis of a dual-radio mesh network, we observed that the majority of routes in the MeshNet were composed of 802.11a links. This predominance is due to the significantly higher data rates offered by 802.11a compared to 802.11b. However, 802.11b has a greater range than 802.11a, and the range of 802.11a is further limited in non-line-of-sight indoor environments, which is typical in the MeshNet. As a result, the nodes in the Roofnet are better connected to each other compared to those in the MeshNet, leading to a higher number of available routes in the Roofnet.

### Impact of Network Planning on Routing Stability

The above observations highlight the importance of network planning in ensuring routing stability. In the case of the MeshNet, the connectivity issues likely contributed to higher persistence and prevalence values compared to the Roofnet. Similarly, Camp et al. [4] found that node placement in their Houston urban mesh deployment influenced routing performance.

### Analysis of Route Persistence and Prevalence

Our analysis of route persistence and prevalence indicates that routes in wireless mesh networks are inherently unstable. This instability often leads to frequent route flaps. The next section investigates the utility of these route flaps by examining the throughput improvements they offer and their lifetimes.

### 4.2 Route Flapping

To analyze the impact of route flaps, we recorded every change in the route between a source-destination pair from one instance to the next. For each route flap, we noted the duration (in minutes) before the next flap occurred and calculated the percentage throughput improvement of the new route over the old route. Assuming a 1500-byte packet, the throughput of a route can be computed by taking the ratio of the packet size to the route’s WCETT value.

Figures 4 and 5 plot the percentage throughput improvement offered by a route flap on the y-axis against the lifetime of the flap on the x-axis. Each point represents a route flap. For clarity, only flap lifetimes in the range of 1 to 50 minutes are shown on the x-axis. Several observations can be made:

1. **High Concentration of Short-Lived Flaps**: The figures show a high concentration of short-lived route flaps. Long-lived flaps are fewer and likely correspond to the dominant routes. Figure 6 shows a cumulative distribution of all route flaps depicted in Figures 4 and 5. Over 60% of the route flaps last only a minute, and 90% last less than five minutes. This high number of short-lived flaps contributes to the instability of routing in both networks, as observed in Section 4.1.

2. **Variable Throughput Improvement**: Despite the high concentration of short-lived flaps, the throughput improvement they offer varies widely. For example, in both networks, one-minute route flaps provide throughput improvements ranging from 0.001% to 100,000%. This suggests that while opportunistic throughput maximization through route flaps can lead to significant instability, many short-lived routes do provide substantial gains in throughput. A routing protocol that prioritizes stability may need to compromise on throughput gains.

3. **Marginal Throughput Improvements**: A large number of route flaps provide only marginal throughput improvements. Figure 7 shows a cumulative distribution of the percentage throughput improvement provided by all route flaps. In the MeshNet, 50% of the route flaps provide less than 10% throughput improvement, while in the Roofnet, 27% of the route flaps provide less than 10% improvement. These flaps vary in duration from 1 to 50 minutes. This implies that a routing protocol that frequently flaps routes will likely achieve only minimal gains in many instances.

### 4.3 Can Routing Stability be Improved?

The previous observations suggest that route flapping can be reduced by selectively choosing an alternate route between a source-destination pair. For example, a routing protocol might switch to an alternate route only if it offers more than 10% throughput improvement over the current route. In the UCSB MeshNet, such a dampening threshold could eliminate more than 50% of all route flaps. Another potential dampening metric is to switch to an alternate route only if it is consistently better for a specified period, such as two minutes. This strategy could eliminate more than 60% of all route flapping in the UCSB MeshNet.

To investigate the potential improvements in routing stability using these dampening techniques, we applied two metrics: a 10% throughput improvement threshold and an alternate route persistence value of two minutes. Figures 8 and 9 show the results, plotting the persistence values of the dominant routes against the fraction of all dominant routes. In the MeshNet, the one-minute dampening metric yields a 5-fold increase in persistence, and the 10% threshold yields a 4.5-fold increase. In the Roofnet, the 10% threshold yields a 4-fold increase, and the one-minute threshold yields a 3-fold increase.

These results indicate that using low thresholds during route selection in a mesh network can significantly increase the persistence of dominant routes, thereby enhancing stability. Increased persistence reduces routing pathologies such as packet reordering [3], but may lower end-to-end throughput. Future work will focus on the trade-offs between stability and throughput in more detail.

### 5 Conclusion

This paper presents a measurement-based characterization of routing stability in two static wireless mesh networks, providing a first step towards understanding the long-term behavior of routes in such networks. Future research will explore the impact of traffic load, external interference, daily and weekly patterns, and physical layer properties like transmission power and receiver sensitivity. The insights gained from this study can stimulate further research into mesh routing behavior, aiding in the design of better routing protocols and network management tools.
