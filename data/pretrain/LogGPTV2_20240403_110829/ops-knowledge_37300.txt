User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题MSTSC crash on connect We are supporting a client with primarily Windows XP machines.  The users need to use Remote Desktop to connect to a terminal server.  Unfortunately, after upgrading to SP3 on some machines MSTSC.exe crashes when they try to connect to the terminal server (a Win 2008 machine).  The resolution I have found has been to revert to an older version of MSTSC as described here: http://it.tmod.pl/Blog/EntryId/115/Remote-Desktop-Connection-crashes.aspx .   Another tech at my company independently arrived at a similar solution.  

Unfortunately, now some of the user's printers are missing (when connected tot he terminal server).  Has anyone else seen this issue?  How did you resolve it?

Assistant: i had similar problem, try this:


remove content of C:\Documents and Settings\user\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Cache
log off, log on


don't ask why... it just did the trick for me.
