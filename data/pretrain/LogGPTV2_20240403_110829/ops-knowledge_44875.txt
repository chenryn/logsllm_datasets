User: I want to run something like:
python command.py  -i -c  "f*.xxx" "search"

This fine since "file-set" is not expanded" but:
python command.py -i -c  f*.xxx "search"

This is expanded so 
sys.argv = ['command.py','-i', '-c', 'f1.xxx','f2.xxx','search']

Why couldn't it be  ['command.py','-i', '-c', ['f1.xxx','f2.xxx'],'search'] ?
Since the "f*.xxx" is not accessible I have no way to know if 'search' is a file name and the real 'search' missing.  I want to print an error message that
says "Please use quotes".  And I must keep position this way and turning off
globbing is not an option. getopt and argparse do not solve this.
Thanks
Assistant: It's your shell, not Python, that's doing the expansion. Python always sees a single flat list of arguments.
In case you want to parse arguments, which basically turns this flat list into a more complex data structure, you can use the argparse module, or use more extensive third party projects like click.
