Advantages and disadvantages of cloud computing Advantages: a. Economical: It avoids the additional costs of infrastructure construction, hardware maintenance, software upgrades, etc. for enterprises. b. Flexibility: Cloud computing resources can be allocated at any time and on demand, enabling enterprises to quickly respond to market demand. c. Scalability: Enterprises can easily expand computing and storage resources according to their own business needs. d. Security: The infrastructure and software of cloud vendors have undergone strict security testing and auditing to ensure data security and reliability. Disadvantages: a. Security risks: Because data is stored on third-party servers, the risks of data leakage and data loss increase accordingly. b. Reliability risk: If the cloud service provider fails, the impact may be all-round. c. Reliance on network connection: The use of cloud computing means the need to transmit data on the Internet. Therefore, the quality of the network connection between the enterprise and the cloud provider plays a crucial role in the service quality of the provider. 3. Commonly used cloud service providers a.
