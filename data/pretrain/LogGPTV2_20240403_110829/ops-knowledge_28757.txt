This log chunk consists of 20 lines, each detailing an `INFO` level event related to the `dfs.FSNamesystem` component. Specifically, the `NameSystem.delete` operation is adding various block IDs to the `invalidSet` of different DataNodes, identified by their IP addresses and port `50010`. Below is a step-by-step summary of the log entries:

1. **Timestamps and Process IDs**:
   - The logs are recorded between `2008-11-10 10:31:12` and `2008-11-10 10:31:46`.
   - Most entries are associated with process ID `30`, except for one entry at `10:31:23` with process ID `33`.

2. **Block IDs Added to invalidSet**:
   - Each line indicates that a specific block ID (e.g., `blk_7819984111120374407`) is being added to the `invalidSet` of a DataNode.
   - The block IDs are unique and include both positive and negative values.

3. **DataNodes Affected**:
   - The DataNodes are identified by their IP addresses, such as `10.251.30.6`, `10.251.43.115`, `10.251.39.64`, etc.
   - All DataNodes are using port `50010`.

### Summary
The log entries document the `NameSystem.delete` operation in the `dfs.FSNamesystem` component, which is marking 20 different blocks as invalid across multiple DataNodes. Each block is added to the `invalidSet` of a specific DataNode, identified by its IP address and port `50010`. This activity occurs over a period of approximately 34 seconds, with most events involving process ID `30` and one event involving process ID `33`.

### Example Log Entry
```
2008-11-10 10:31:12, INFO, 30, dfs.FSNamesystem, BLOCK* NameSystem.delete: blk_7819984111120374407 is added to invalidSet of 10.251.30.6:50010
```

This pattern is consistent across all 20 lines, with the only variations being the timestamp, block ID, and DataNode IP address.
