### Participants' PIN Changing

The phrases were displayed randomly, and participants responded using a Likert scale. The results are shown in Figure 8. To facilitate comparison, we converted the Likert responses into weighted averages on a scale of -2 to +2. Table VIII summarizes the participants' PIN changing behavior.

| Treatment   | Hits | Sample | Same Minor | New Mean | Edit Distance (SD) |
|-------------|------|--------|------------|----------|--------------------|
| Pla-4       | 122  | 29     | 7          | 3.20     | 0.90               |
| iOS-4-wC    | 9*   | 9      | 4          | 3.11     | 0.87               |

| DD-4-27     | 5    | 5      | 2          | 3.20     | 0.75               |
| DD-4-2740   | 88   | 29     | 7          | 3.39     | 0.76               |
| Pla-6       | 117  | 28     | 5          | 4.59     | 1.41               |
| iOS-6-wC    | 5*   | 5      | 2          | 4.40     | 1.20               |

*Hit blacklist and did not click-through.

Since the weighted averages are not normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk test, p < 0.001), we used a Mann-Whitney U test for initial differences, followed by post-hoc, pair-wise tests using Dunn’s-test comparisons with a Bonferroni correction.

### Security Perceptions

Significant differences were found across treatments when considering security perceptions. Post-hoc analysis revealed that the presence of a blacklist for 4-digit PINs increased the perceived security of the final PIN selected. This is supported by comparing the 4-digit placebo treatment (Pla-4) to the 4-digit control (Con-4). In the placebo treatment, every participant interacted with a blacklist, resulting in a significant increase in security perceptions (p < 0.01). Similar differences were observed for the large blacklist treatment DD-4-2740 (p < 0.001), where 70% of participants encountered the blacklist. No significant differences were found for 6-digit PIN users, possibly due to a pre-existing notion that 6-digit PINs are secure.

### Memorability

Significant differences were also found among the treatments regarding memorability. Post-hoc analysis indicated that increased interaction with the blacklist led to lower perceived memorability of PINs. This was evident in the Pla-4 (p < 0.001), DD-4-2740 (p < 0.001), and Pla-6 (p < 0.01) treatments compared to their respective control treatments. The DD-4-2740 treatment showed the most significant differences, likely because many participants encountered the blacklist multiple times, leading to reliance on less memorable second, third, and fourth-choice PINs.

### Convenience

Perceived convenience also showed significant differences, but post-hoc analysis revealed limited effects in pair-wise comparisons. Generally, participants perceived their 4-digit PINs at the same convenience level across treatments. While no significant difference was found between 4- and 6-digit PINs, a significant difference (p < 0.01) was observed between the 6-digit placebo and control treatments, suggesting higher perceived inconvenience for second-choice 6-digit PINs.

### User Sentiment

To gain insight into participants' sentiments regarding blacklisting, we asked them to describe three general feelings or reactions after receiving a warning message or what they would have felt if they did not encounter a blacklist. Responses were coded by two individual coders, and inter-rater reliability was high (Cohen’s kappa, κ = 0.91).

Using the NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon [29], we classified the assigned codes in terms of sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) as shown in Figure 9. As expected, participants generally had a negative reaction to the blacklist warning message. A χ2 test revealed a significant difference (p < 0.05) in the proportion of negative sentiment when considering PIN length for the two placebo treatments. Users were more negatively affected by the 4-digit placebo blacklist, possibly due to confusion and anger over arbitrary warnings. For 6-digit PINs, less familiarity may have led to fewer negative reactions.

Interestingly, participants generally consider displaying warnings about weak PIN choices to be appropriate, even though they cannot imagine their own choice being insecure. Sentiments were similar for those who hit the blacklist and those who imagined doing so, suggesting that future research on blacklist warning design could benefit from asking participants to imagine such events.

### Conclusion and Recommendations

This study presents a comprehensive analysis of PIN security in the smartphone unlock setting, considering countermeasures like throttling, blacklisting, and PIN length. Our findings and recommendations for mobile developers include:

- **PIN Length**: Simply increasing PIN length offers little benefit in a throttled scenario. There was no significant difference between 4- and 6-digit PINs within the first 100 guesses.
- **Blacklists**: On iOS, a blacklist did not provide security benefits, either for 4- or 6-digit PINs. On Android, a blacklist would be beneficial for 4-digit PINs but would need to cover roughly 10% of the PIN space, which is more than currently deployed.
- **Convenience**: Perceived convenience is lower when users select a second 6-digit PIN compared to a second 4-digit PIN, suggesting less familiarity with 6-digit PINs.
- **Placebo Blacklist**: While a placebo blacklist has advantages in unthrottled settings, it is not recommended as users will likely game it once the deception is known.
