averages are not normally distributed, tested using the Shapiro-
Wilk test (p < 0.001), we tested for initial differences using a
Mann-Whitney U test, followed with post-hoc, pair-wise tests
using Dunn’s-test comparisons of independent samples with a
Bonferroni correction.
We found that there are signiﬁcant differences across treat-
ments when considering Likert responses for security. Post-
hoc analysis indicates that the presence of a blacklist for 4-
digit PINs increases the security perception of the ﬁnal PIN
selected. This is supported by considering the 4-digit placebo
treatment (Pla-4) compared to the 4-digit control (Con-4).
In the placebo treatment, every participant interacted with
a blacklist, and there is a signiﬁcant
increase in security
perceptions (p < 0.01). We see similar differences for the large
blacklist treatment DD-4-2740 (p < 0.001), where again, a
large portion (70 %) of participants encountered the blacklist.
We did not see signiﬁcant differences for 6-digit PIN users
after encountering the blacklist. This may be because there is
a pre-existing notion that 6-digit PINs are secure.
For memorability we also found signiﬁcant differences
among the treatments. In post-hoc analysis we found that
increased interaction with the blacklist led to lower perceived
memorability of PINs, as evidenced by the Pla-4 (p < 0.001),
DD-4-2740 (p < 0.001), and the Pla-6 (p < 0.01) treatments
compared to their respective control treatments. The DD-4-
2740 showed the most signiﬁcant differences with other treat-
ments, likely due to the fact that many participants encountered
the blacklist for multiple PIN choices and thus were relying on
not just second-choice PINs, but also third- and fourth-choice,
etc. PINs that are perceived to be less memorable.

Fig. 9. Participants’ sentiment: We split the participants into four categories
and classiﬁed their feelings in terms of sentiment using EmoLex [29].
The responses to perceived convenience also show signiﬁ-
cant differences, however, post-hoc analysis revealed limited
effects when considering pair-wise comparisons. In general,
participants perceived their 4-digit PINs at the same conve-
nience level across treatments. While we did not see a signif-
icant difference between convenience levels between 4- and
6-digit PINs, the perceived convenience of 6-digit PINs may
be precarious because we observed a signiﬁcant difference
(p < 0.01) between the 6-digit placebo and control treatments.
This suggests that while a user may be comfortable with
their ﬁrst-choice 6-digit PIN, there is much higher perceived
inconvenience for their second-choice 6-digit PIN.
F. User Sentiment
To gain insight
into participants’ sentiments regarding
blacklisting, we asked “Please describe three general feelings
or reactions that you had after you received this warning
message” or “would have had” if the participant did not
encounter a blacklist. Accompanying the prompt are three
free-form, short text ﬁelds. A codebook was constructed by
two individual coders summarized in Appendix D in Table
XI. For each of the four categories (blacklist hit experienced
vs. imagined, 4- vs. 6-digit PINs, non-enforcing vs. enforc-
ing, different blacklist sizes), 21 individuals’ responses were
randomly selected. Again, two individual raters were tasked
with coding the responses. The inter-rater reliability, computed
using Cohen’s kappa, was κ = 0.91.
Using the NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon [29],
we classiﬁed assigned codes in terms of sentiment (positive,
negative, or neutral) for Figure 9. EmoLex maps individual
English words (in this case, codes assigned by our coders) to
exactly one sentiment. For example, “indifference,” is labeled
with the “negative” sentiment. As expected, participants gener-
ally had a negative reaction to the blacklist warning message.
While overall, participants expressed negative sentiments
towards blacklist messages, which may be expected as warning
messages are not often well received by users [1], we only
observed signiﬁcant differences in a single comparison.
Using a χ2 test, we found that there was signiﬁcant differ-
ence (p < 0.05) in the proportion of negative sentiment when
considering PIN length for the two placebo treatments. As both
groups always experienced a blacklist event, a higher negative
sentiment exists for the placebo blacklist with 4-digits. This
might be because users were confused and angered by the
warning as the blacklist event was arbitrary. However, in the
6-digit PIN case, less familiarity with 6-digit PINs may have
led to less negative reactions.
Interestingly, participants in general consider displaying
warnings about weak PIN choices to be appropriate although
they cannot imagine that their own choice might be considered
insecure. Moreover, sentiments are similar for those who hit
the blacklist and those who imagined having done so. This
suggests that future research on blacklist warning design may
beneﬁt from simply asking participants to imagine such events.
VII. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This paper presents the ﬁrst comprehensive study of PIN
security as primed for the smartphone unlock setting. In the
smartphone unlock setting, developers have adopted notable
countermeasures—throttling, blacklisting, PIN length—which
we consider as part of our analysis. Using a throttled attacker
model, we ﬁnd that 6-digit PINs offer little to no advantage,
and sometimes make matters worse. Also, blacklists would
have to be far larger than those in use on today’s mobile
operating systems to affect security.
Given this information, we offer a number of recommenda-
tions to mobile developers.
• In a throttled scenario, simply increasing the PIN length
is of little beneﬁt. In our results, there was no signiﬁcant
difference between 4- and 6-digit PINs within the ﬁrst
100 guesses. To justify the adoption of longer PINs,
developers should carefully articulate an alternative threat
model. Observe that without throttling, an attacker could
quickly try all 4- and 6-digit PINs.
• On iOS, with only 10 possible guesses, we could not ob-
serve any security beneﬁts when a blacklist is deployed,
either for 4- or 6-digit PINs. On Android, where 100
guesses are feasible, we ﬁnd that a blacklist would be
beneﬁcial for 4-digit PINs. However, such a blacklist
would need to contain roughly 10% of the PIN space
which is much more than currently deployed blacklists.
More research is needed to test
the effectiveness of
blacklists for 6-digit PINs.
• We observe that
the perceived convenience is lower
when users are forced to select a second 6-digit PIN
as compared to selecting a second 4-digit PIN (as was
the case in the placebo treatments). This may suggest
users are less familiar with selecting 6-digit PINs, but
the reasons for this are left to future investigation.
• While we observed advantages for using a placebo black-
list in the unthrottled settings, we do not recommend
implementing a placebo blacklist, as users will simply
game it once the deception is known.
