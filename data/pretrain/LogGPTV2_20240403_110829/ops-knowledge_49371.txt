User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Vsphere 5.5 reset root I would like to change the root password used to access our virtual environment, I am using the vsphere client (5.5) connecting to a virtual appliance but cannot find where I can change this.

Assistant: Open the vSphere client...


Navigate to "Local Users &amp; Groups".
Right-click on the "root" user.
Select "Edit..."


From the dialog below, you can change the password.





Edit:

You can also change the password at the ESXi host's console:

Log on, then choose "Configure password".





Edit #2:

You've clarified that you're trying to change the root password of the VMware vCenter Server Appliance. That was not clear in the original question.

In order to change the password of the appliance's root user, you need to log onto its management interface at: https://ip.of.vcenter:5480/

From there, select the "Admin" tab and follow the prompts to change the Administrator user password.
