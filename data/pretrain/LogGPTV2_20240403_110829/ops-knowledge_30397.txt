User: Is there any library to show progress when adding files to a tar archive in python or alternativly would be be possible to extend the functionality of the tarfile module to do this?
In an ideal world I would like to show the overall progress of the tar creation as well as an ETA as to when it will be complete. 
Any help on this would be really appreciated.
Assistant: How are you adding files to the tar file? Is is through "add" with recursive=True? You could build the list of files yourself and call "add" one-by-one, showing the progress as you go. If you're building from a stream/file then it looks like you could wrap that fileobj to see the read status and pass that into addfile.
It does not look like you will need to modify tarfile.py at all.
