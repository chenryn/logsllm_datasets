Successful installation of xDB Replication Server results in the creation of directory
structures and files in your host environment as described in Section 3.5.
3.2 Installing from the Command Line
The section provides directions for installing xDB Replication Server from the Linux or
Windows command line console.
There are basically three ways of performing command line installation.
 Text. Include the --mode text parameter when invoking the installer to
perform an installation from the command line during which you are prompted for
user input.
 Unattended. Include the --mode unattended parameter when invoking the
installer to perform an installation without user input. In this case, required
parameters must be specified on the command line when invoking the installer or
the --optionfile parameter must be used to specify a file containing the
parameter settings.

EDB Postgres Replication Server User’s Guide
 Extract Only. Invoke the installer with the --extract-only parameter to only
extract the files when you do not hold the root privileges required to perform a
complete installation.
The xDB Replication Server installer program can either be downloaded directly from the
EnterpriseDB website or by using Stack Builder or StackBuilder Plus.
The installer program name may vary depending upon how you obtained it. The
following are some examples illustrating command line installation.
Note: For additional detailed information on how to install EnterpriseDB products from
the command line, see the EDB Postgres Advanced Server Installation Guide located at:
https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/product-documentation
Note: You must have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.7 or later installed on
the hosts where you intend to install any xDB Replication Server component (xDB
Replication Console, publication server, or subscription server). Any Java product such
as Oracle Java or OpenJDK may be used.
Follow the directions for your host operating system to install Java runtime.
Note: For Advanced Server versions prior to 9.3, a Java runtime is supplied and installed
as part of the Advanced Server installation process, however, you must still have pre-
installed a separate Java runtime system on your host. The xDB Replication Server
installation process does not utilize the Java runtime supplied with Advanced Server.
The following example shows how to start the xDB Replication Server installation in text
mode.
$ ./xdbreplicationserver-6.1.0-alpha-1-linux-x64.run --mode text
