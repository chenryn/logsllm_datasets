Abstract
In this work we perform the ﬁrst comprehensive study
of physical-layer identiﬁcation of RFID transponders.
We propose several techniques for the extraction of
RFID physical-layer ﬁngerprints. We show that RFID
transponders can be accurately identiﬁed in a controlled
environment based on stable ﬁngerprints corresponding
to their physical-layer properties. We tested our tech-
niques on a set of 50 RFID smart cards of the same
manufacturer and type, and we show that these tech-
niques enable the identiﬁcation of individual transpon-
ders with an Equal Error Rate of 2.43% (single run) and
4.38% (two runs). We further applied our techniques to a
smaller set of electronic passports, where we obtained
a similar identiﬁcation accuracy. Our results indicate
that physical-layer identiﬁcation of RFID transponders
can be practical and thus has a potential to be used in a
number of applications including product and document
counterfeiting detection.

Introduction
Passively powered Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation De-
vices (RFID) are becoming increasingly important com-
ponents of a number of security systems such as elec-
tronic passports [3], contactless identity cards [4], and
supply chain systems [16]. Due to their importance,
a number of security protocols have been proposed for
RFID authentication [46, 25, 17], key management [31,
28] and privacy-preserving deployment [6, 29, 26, 37,
19, 14, 13]. International standards have been accepted
that specify the use of RFID tags in electronic travel
documents [3]. Although the literature contains a num-
ber of investigations of RFID security and privacy proto-
cols [27, 5] on the logical level, little attention has been
dedicated to the security implications of the RFID phys-
ical communication layer.
In this work, we focus on the RFID physical com-
munication layer and perform the ﬁrst study of RFID
transponder physical-layer identiﬁcation. We present a
hardware set-up and a set of techniques that enable us to
perform the identiﬁcation of individual RFID transpon-
ders of the same manufacturer and model. We show that
RFID transponders can be accurately identiﬁed in a con-
trolled measurement environment based on stable ﬁnger-
prints corresponding to their physical-layer properties.
The measurement environment requires close proximity
and ﬁxed positioning of the transponder with respect to
the acquisition antennas.
Our techniques are based on the extraction of the mod-
ulation shape and spectral features of the signals emit-
ted by transponders when subjected to both well formed
reader signals, and to out of speciﬁcation reader signals.
We tested our techniques on a set of 50 RFID smart
cards of the same manufacturer and type and show that
these techniques enable the identiﬁcation of individual
cards with an Equal Error Rate of 2.43% (single run) and
4.38% (two runs). We further applied our techniques to
a smaller set of electronic passports, where we obtained
a similar identiﬁcation accuracy. We also tested the clas-
siﬁcation accuracy of our techniques, and show that they
achieve an average classiﬁcation error of 0% for a set of
classes corresponding to the countries of issuance. We
further show that our techniques produce features that
form compact and computationally efﬁcient ﬁngerprints.
Given the low frequencies of operation of the transpon-
ders in our study, the extraction of the ﬁngerprints is
inexpensive, and could be performed using a low-cost
purpose-built reader.
Although the implications of physical-layer identiﬁ-
cation of RFID transponders are broad, we believe that
the techniques we present can potentially ﬁnd their use
in the detection of cloned products and identity docu-
ments, where the (stored) ﬁngerprints of legitimate doc-
uments are compared with those of the presented doc-
uments. Our experimental setup corresponds to this
application in which the transponders are ﬁngerprinted
from close proximity and in a controlled environment.
It has been recently shown that despite numerous pro-
tections, RFIDs in current electronic documents can be
successfully cloned [18, 34, 33, 47], even if they ap-
ply the full range of protective measures speciﬁed by
the standard [3], including active authentication. We see
our techniques as an additional, efﬁcient and inexpen-
sive mechanism that can be used to detect RFID cloning.
More precisely, to avoid detection of a cloned document,
an adversary has to produce a clone using a transponder
with the same ﬁngerprint as the original document. Al-
though, it may be hard to perform such task, the amount
of effort required is an open research problem. We dis-
cuss two methods of applying RFID physical-layer iden-
tiﬁcation to cloning detection and compare it to other
anti-cloning solutions, like those based on physically-
unclonable functions (PUFs) [12].
Our results show the feasibility of RFID transponder
ﬁngerprinting in a controlled environment. Using the
proposed methods is not enough to extract the same or
similar ﬁngerprints from a larger distance (e.g., 1 meter).
In our experiments, such remote feature extraction pro-
cess resulted in incorrect identiﬁcation. Therefore, we
cannot assert that chip holder privacy can be compro-
mised remotely using our techniques. This result further
motivates an investigation of physical-layer features of
RFID transponders that would allow their remote iden-
tiﬁcation, irrespective of (e.g., random) protocol-level
identiﬁers that the devices use on the logical communi-
cation level. Our current results do not allow us to con-
clude that such distinguishable features can be extracted
remotely.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In
Section 2, we present our system model and investigation
parameters.
In Section 3, we detail our ﬁngerprinting
setup (i.e., a purpose-built reader), signal capturing pro-
cess and summarize the data acquisition procedure and
collected data. The proposed features for transponder
classiﬁcation and identiﬁcation are explained in Section
4 and their performance is analyzed in Section 5. We dis-
cuss an application of our techniques to document coun-
terfeiting detection in Section 6, make an overview of
background and related work in Section 7 and conclude
the paper in Section 8.
2 Problem and System Overview
In this work, we explore physical-layer techniques for
detection of cloned and/or counterfeit devices. We
focus on building physical-layer ﬁngerprints of RFID
transponders for the following two objectives:
1. RFID transponder classiﬁcation: the ability to as-
sociate RFID transponders to previously deﬁned
transponder classes.
In the case of identity docu-
2
ments classes might, for example, be deﬁned based
on the country that issued the document and the year
of issuance.
2. RFID transponder identiﬁcation: the ability to iden-
tify same model and manufacturer RFID transpon-
ders. In the case of identity documents, this could
mean identifying documents from the same country,
year and place of issuance.
A classiﬁcation system must associate unknown RFID
transponder ﬁngerprints to previously deﬁned classes C.
It performs ”1-to-C” comparisons and assigns the RFID
ﬁngerprint to the class with the highest similarity accord-
ing to a chosen similarity measure (Section 5.1). This
corresponds to a scenario in which an authority veriﬁes
whether an identity document belongs to a claimed class
(e.g., country of issuance).
An identiﬁcation system typically works in one of
two modes: either identiﬁcation of one device among
many, or veriﬁcation that a device’s ﬁngerprint matches
its claimed identity [8]. In this work, we consider veri-
ﬁcation of a device’s claimed or assumed identity. This
corresponds to a scenario in which the ﬁngerprint of an
identity document (e.g., passport), stored in a back-end
database or in the document chip, is compared to the
measured ﬁngerprint of the presented document. The
veriﬁcation system provides an Accept/Reject decision
based on a threshold value T (Section 5.1). Identity ver-
iﬁcation requires only ”1-to-1” ﬁngerprint comparison
and is therefore scalable in the number of transponders.
In this study we use a single experimental setup for ex-
amination of both classiﬁcation and identiﬁcation. Our
setup consists of two main components: a signal acquisi-
tion setup (i.e., a purpose-built RFID reader) (Section 3)
and a feature selection and matching component (Sec-
tion 4). In our signal acquisition setup we use a purpose-
built reader to transmit crafted signals which then stim-
ulate a response from the target RFID transponders. We
then capture and analyze such responses. In particular,
we consider transponder responses when subjected to the
following signals from the reader: standard [4] transpon-
der wake-up message,
transponder wake-up message
at intentionally out-of-speciﬁcation carrier frequencies,
a high-energy burst of sinusoidal carrier at an out-of-
speciﬁcation frequency, and a high-energy linear fre-
quency sweep.
To evaluate the system accuracy, we make use of
two different device populations (Table 1). The ﬁrst
population consists of 50 ”identical” JCOP NXP 4.1
smart cards [2] which contain NXP RFID transponders
(ISO 14443, HF 13.56 MHz). We chose these transpon-
ders since they are popular for use in identity docu-
ments and access cards, and because they have also been
used by hackers to demonstrate cloning attacks against
e-passports [47]. The second population contains 8
electronic passports from 3 different countries1. These
two populations allow us to deﬁne different transponder
classes (e.g., 3 issuing countries, and a separate class for
JCOP cards) for classiﬁcation and include a sufﬁcient set
of identical transponders to quantify the identiﬁcation ac-
curacy of the transponders of the same model and manu-
facturer.
In summary, in this work, we answer the following
interrelated questions:
1. What is the classiﬁcation accuracy for different
classes of transponders, given the extracted fea-
tures?
2. What is the identiﬁcation accuracy for transponders
of the same model and manufacturer, given the ex-
tracted features?
3. How is the classiﬁcation and identiﬁcation accuracy
affected by the number of signals used to build the
transponder ﬁngerprint?
4. How stable are the extracted features, across differ-
ent acquisition runs and across different transponder
placements (relative to the reader)?
3 Experimental Setup and Data
In this section, we ﬁrst describe our signal acquisition
setup. We then detail the different types of experiments
we performed and present the collected datasets from our
population of transponders.
3.1 Hardware Setup
Figure 1 displays the hardware setup that we use to col-
lect RF signals from the RFID devices. Our setup is
essentially a purpose-built RFID reader that can oper-
ate within the standardized RFID communication spec-
iﬁcations [4], but can also operate out of speciﬁcations,
thus enabling a broader range of experiments. The setup
consists of two signal generators, used for envelope gen-
eration (envelope generator) and for signal modulation
(modulation generator), and of transmitting and acqui-
sition antennas. The envelope generator is fed with a
waveform that represents the communication protocol
wake-up command2 required for initiating communica-
tion with RFID transponders. The envelope waveform
1The small quantity of the electronic passports used in the experi-
ments is due to the difﬁculty of ﬁnding people who are in possession of
such passports and at the same time willing to allow experimentation
on them.

communication protocols, Type A and B, which use different wake-up
commands: WUQA and WUQB, respectively.

is then sent to the modulation generator and is modu-
lated according to the ISO/IEC 14443 protocol Type A or
B, depending on the transponders being contacted. The
modulated signal is then sent over a PCB transmitting an-
tenna. Finally, the wake-up signal and the response from
the transponder are received at the acquisition antenna
and captured at the oscilloscope. The separation of the
envelope generation and modulation steps allowed us to
independently vary envelope and modulation character-
istics in our experiments.
In order to collect the RF signal response, we built a
”sandwich” style antenna arrangement (Figure 2b) where
an acquisition antenna is positioned between the trans-
mission antenna and the target RFID transponder. An
wooden platform holds the transmission and acquisition
antennas in a ﬁxed position to avoid changes in antenna
polarization3. The platform is separated from the desk by
a non-metallic wooden cage. The transmission and ac-
quisition antennas are both connected to an oscilloscope.
We used the RF signal on the transmission antenna to
trigger the acquisition and then record the transponder’s
response at the acquisition antenna. It should be noted
that we can also observe the transponder’s response at
the transmission antenna, however as the acquisition an-
tenna had a higher gain than the transmission antenna, we
used the described setup to obtain better signal-to-noise
ratio.
3.2 Performed Experiments
Using the proposed setup, we performed four major ex-
periments:
Experiment 1 (Standard): In this experiment we initi-
ate communication with the transponders as deﬁned by
Type A and B protocols in the ISO/IEC 14443 standard.
The envelope generator generates the Type A and B en-
velopes and the modulation generator modulates the sig-
nal at a carrier frequency Fc= 13.56 MHz, using 100%
ASK for Type A and 10% ASK for Type B at the nomi-
nal bit rate of Fb ∼ 106kbit/s.4 The experiment consists
of the following steps: a period of unmodulated carrier
is transmitted to power the transponder at which time
the oscilloscope begins recording the data. The carrier
is then modulated according to the envelope such that it
corresponds to a WUQA (Type A) or WUQB (Type B)
