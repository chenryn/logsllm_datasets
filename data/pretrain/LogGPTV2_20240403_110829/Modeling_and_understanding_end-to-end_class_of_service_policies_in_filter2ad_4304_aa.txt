# Abstract
Business and economic factors are driving the extensive use of service differentiation in Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for business enterprises. The resulting Class of Service (CoS) designs involve complex policy decisions based on application priorities, bandwidth availability, and cost considerations. These high-level policies are implemented through low-level router configurations, which can be tedious and error-prone due to the intertwined nature of CoS configurations, multiple router configurations, and complex access control lists (ACLs). Our contributions include:

1. A formal approach to modeling CoS policies from router configuration files.
2. A practical and computationally efficient tool to determine the CoS treatments for arbitrary flow sets across multiple routers.
3. Validation of our approach using data from 150 diverse enterprise VPNs, enabling applications such as troubleshooting, auditing, and visualization of network-wide CoS design.

To our knowledge, this is the first effort aimed at modeling and analyzing CoS configurations.

# 1. Introduction
Service differentiation using Class of Service (CoS) is increasingly adopted in various network settings, including enterprise Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). The need for CoS differentiation arises from several considerations:

1. **Diverse Application Needs:** IP networks today carry traffic from a variety of applications with different performance requirements, such as low delay and low loss for Voice over IP (VoIP) and high throughput for bulk data transfer like FTP.
2. **Application Priorities:** Different applications have varying importance to an enterprise customer. For example, web service transactions supporting critical workflows may be given higher priority than traffic from external web browsing.
3. **Economic Considerations:** There is a need to optimize the usage of existing network infrastructures under finite capacity and cost constraints while ensuring good performance for important applications.

CoS designs embed inherently complex policy decisions based on application priorities, bandwidth availability, and cost considerations. These policies are realized through low-level router configurations, which can be challenging to manage. Troubleshooting poor performance involves tracing the configured CoS treatment of individual flows across router configuration files, each of which can contain thousands of command lines. Misconfigurations can lead to violations of service level agreements (SLAs), business service disruptions, and penalties for the service provider.

# 1.1 Contributions
In this paper, we make the following contributions:

- **Highlighting the Prevalence and Complexity of CoS:** We draw attention to the prevalence of CoS and the complexity inherent in managing CoS configurations, a topic that is little known outside the operational community. Our understanding comes from inspecting router configuration files from numerous enterprise VPNs and interacting with network designers.
- **Formal Representation of CoS Policies:** We propose a formal representation of CoS policies that is independent of the underlying configuration syntax. This representation is easily derivable from low-level configurations and enables systematic composition of CoS policies across multiple policy blocks within a single router and across multiple routers.
- **Query Tool for CoS Analysis:** Based on our framework, we have built a query tool that allows operators to determine how an arbitrary set of flows are treated on an "end-to-end" basis. The tool leverages binary decision diagrams (BDDs) for efficient computation. It is currently targeted at Cisco IOS configurations and enterprise VPN settings, focusing on CoS policies at the customer and provider edge.
- **Evaluation and Effectiveness:** We have evaluated our tool on a cross-section of 150 different enterprise VPNs. The results confirm the importance and effectiveness of our approach in assisting operators to reason about network-wide CoS operations, audit overall CoS design, identify anomalous flow treatments, and derive a network-wide view of the CoS design.

# 2. Background and Motivation
Enterprise networks are increasingly moving from dedicated private lines to using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), especially Layer-3 Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) technology, to connect geographically disparate sites. In this architecture, each site has one or more Customer Edge Routers (CERs), which are jointly configured by the enterprise customer and service provider. Each CER connects to the provider network via one or more Provider Edge Routers (PERs).

## 2.1 Service Differentiation in VPNs
A primary consideration for service providers in designing enterprise VPNs is to satisfy various application needs such as delay, jitter, and bandwidth. Both the enterprise and provider must support traffic for applications with different performance requirements and service priorities over a common network infrastructure. Service differentiation is essential for traffic management in such a heterogeneous environment. Service Level Agreements (SLAs) describe the agreed-upon performance requirements for different applications, involving complex choices based on application requirements, priorities, and cost. Violations of SLAs can have adverse consequences, including disruption of critical enterprise activities and heavy penalties for the service provider.

## 2.2 Realizing Service Differentiation Using CoS
Class of Service (CoS) is a method for realizing service differentiation by grouping traffic with similar service requirements and treating each group as a class with its own level of service priority. The Type of Service (ToS) field in the IP header indicates the priority class of each packet. Typically, the first 6 bits of the ToS field encode the class information, referred to as the Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) bits. These bits are used by CERs and PERs to decide the treatment that a packet must receive.
