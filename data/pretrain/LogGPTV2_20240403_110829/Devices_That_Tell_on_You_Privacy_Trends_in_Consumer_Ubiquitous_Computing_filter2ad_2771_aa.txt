## Abstract
We analyze three new consumer electronic gadgets to assess the privacy and security trends in mass-market ubiquitous computing (UbiComp) devices. Our study of the Slingbox Pro reveals a new information leakage vector for encrypted streaming multimedia. By exploiting properties of variable bitrate (VBR) encoding schemes, we demonstrate that a passive adversary can determine with high probability the movie a user is watching via her Slingbox, even when the Slingbox uses encryption. We experimentally evaluated our method against a database of over 100 hours of network traces for 26 distinct movies.

Despite the potential for significantly more location privacy than existing devices like RFIDs, we find that an attacker can easily exploit the Nike+iPod Sport Kit's design to track users. We demonstrate this with a Google Maps-based distributed surveillance system. Additionally, we uncover security issues with how Microsoft Zunes manage their social relationships.

We show how these products' designers could have significantly raised the bar against some of our attacks. We also use some of our attacks to highlight fundamental security and privacy challenges for future UbiComp devices.

## 1. Introduction
As technology continues to advance, computational devices will increasingly permeate our everyday lives, placing more wireless computers in our environment and on our persons. Many manufacturers predict that the increasing capabilities and decreasing costs of wireless radios will enable common electronics in future homes to be predominantly wireless, eliminating the clutter of wires. For example, TVs, cable boxes, speakers, and DVD players could communicate without the proximity restrictions of wires. The changing technological landscape will also lead to new computing devices, such as personal health monitors, for us to wear as we move around our community.

While the UbiComp revolution has many positive aspects, it is crucial to ensure that users' privacy and security are not compromised. By studying the Sling Media Slingbox Pro, the Nike+iPod Sport Kit, and the Microsoft Zune, we provide a checkpoint of current industrial trends regarding the privacy and security of this new generation of UbiComp devices.

In some cases, such as inferring information about what movie a user is watching from 10 minutes of a Slingbox Pro's encrypted transmissions, we present new directions for computer security research. In other cases, such as the Nike+iPod's use of a globally unique persistent identifier, the key privacy issues are not new, but the ease with which we can mount our attacks is surprising. This is particularly true because it would have been technically possible for the Nike+iPod designers to prevent our attacks.

In all cases, we use our results to outline research challenges that future commercial UbiComp devices should address to provide strong levels of privacy and security.

### 1.1. The Sling Media Slingbox Pro
The Slingbox Pro allows users to remotely view (sling) the contents of their TV over the Internet. The makers of the Slingbox Pro are set to introduce a new device, the wireless SlingCatcher, which will allow Slingbox users to sling video to other TVs within the same home, making it one of the first next-generation wireless video multimedia systems for the home.

We describe a technique for monitoring a network connection, wired or wireless, and predicting the content being transferred based on the data transmission rate. Our method consists of two parts: collecting throughput traces and using a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)-based matching algorithm to query a database and predict the content. With only 10 minutes of monitoring data, we can predict the movie being watched with 62% accuracy, compared to less than 4% by random chance. With 40 minutes of data, we achieve 77% accuracy. For certain movies, we can predict with over 98% accuracy. This indicates significant information leakage, which is not immediately obvious to users who trust the built-in encryption.

### 1.2. The Nike+iPod Sport Kit
The Nike+iPod Sport Kit is a wireless accessory for the iPod Nano. It consists of a sensor placed in a shoe and a receiver attached to the iPod. When the user walks or runs, the sensor transmits information to the receiver, which provides audio feedback about the workout. The sensor has an on-off button, but the documentation suggests leaving it on. Since the documentation encourages users to "just drop the sensor in their Nike+ shoes and forget about it," the kit is a prime example of a device people might always carry.

One well-known privacy risk is if the devices use unique identifiers in communications, and if someone can intercept these identifiers, they might learn private information about a user's presence or location. Given this awareness and media reports that the Nike+iPod Sport Kit used a proprietary wireless protocol, we determined whether the new system "raised the bar" against tracking.

We found that each Nike+iPod sensor has a globally unique identifier and can be detected from 10â€“20 meters away, further than expected. The sensor broadcasts its unique identifier even when no iPods are nearby. To illustrate the ease of creating a tracking system, we developed a network of Nike+iPod surveillance devices, including a $250 gumstix-based node that streams surveillance data to a back-end server, displaying it in real time on Google Maps.

We then describe cryptographic mechanisms that, if implemented, would significantly improve the Nike+iPod Sport Kit's resistance to tracking attacks, though with potential drawbacks like increased battery consumption and communication overhead.

### 1.3. The Microsoft Zune
The Microsoft Zune is a portable digital media player with built-in 802.11 wireless capabilities, allowing users to share pictures and songs with other nearby Zunes, including those belonging to strangers. This feature makes the Zune the first major commercial device designed to catalyze ad hoc social interactions in a peer-to-peer wireless environment.

However, just as spammers can send unsolicited emails, an attacker can beam unsolicited content to a nearby Zune, which may be annoying or malicious. The Zune allows users to block a particular device, but we find it easy for an adversary to subvert this mechanism, repeatedly initiating content pushes until the victim moves out of range or turns off the wireless. This underscores two challenges for UbiComp devices enabling ad hoc social interactions: how to technically implement blocking procedures and balance them with location privacy and the use of globally unique identifiers.

### 1.4. Organization and Remarks
We discuss our analyses of the Slingbox Pro, the Nike+iPod Sport Kit, and the Microsoft Zune, along with associated research challenges, in Sections 2, 3, and 4. We stress that there is no evidence that Sling Media, Apple, Nike, or Microsoft intended for any of these devices to be used maliciously, and none endorsed this study.

## 2. The Slingbox Pro: Information Leakage and Variable Bitrate Encoding
While the future of home entertainment is somewhat uncertain, many companies predict a wireless future. Wireless devices are easier to install, provide more flexibility, and reduce wire clutter. Future wireless technologies promise increased bandwidth, range, and lower manufacturing costs, making them more appealing. Consider the buzz around the upcoming SlingCatcher and Apple TV, both featuring integrated wireless support.

Protecting private information becomes increasingly difficult as we use more wireless devices. We investigated the Slingbox Pro from a privacy standpoint and uncovered a new information leakage vector for encrypted multimedia systems via VBR encoding.

### 2.1. Slingbox Pro Description
The Slingbox Pro is a networked video streaming device by Sling Media, Inc. It can stream video from a built-in TV tuner or four inputs connected to DVD players, cable TV, personal video recorders, etc., and control these devices using an IR emitter. The device has no hard drive and relies on connected devices for content. Paired with SlingPlayer software, the Slingbox Pro allows remote viewing of TV content over the Internet.
