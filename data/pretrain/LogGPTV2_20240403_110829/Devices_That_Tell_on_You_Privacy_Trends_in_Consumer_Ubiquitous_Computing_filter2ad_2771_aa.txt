Abstract
We analyze three new consumer electronic gadgets in
order to gauge the privacy and security trends in mass-
market UbiComp devices. Our study of the Slingbox Pro
uncovers a new information leakage vector for encrypted
streaming multimedia. By exploiting properties of vari-
able bitrate encoding schemes, we show that a passive
adversary can determine with high probability the movie
that a user is watching via her Slingbox, even when the
Slingbox uses encryption. We experimentally evaluated
our method against a database of over 100 hours of net-
work traces for 26 distinct movies.
Despite an opportunity to provide signiﬁcantly more
location privacy than existing devices, like RFIDs, we
ﬁnd that an attacker can trivially exploit the Nike+iPod
Sport Kit’s design to track users; we demonstrate this
with a GoogleMaps-based distributed surveillance sys-
tem. We also uncover security issues with the way Mi-
crosoft Zunes manage their social relationships.
We show how these products’ designers could have
signiﬁcantly raised the bar against some of our attacks.
We also use some of our attacks to motivate fundamen-
tal security and privacy challenges for future UbiComp
devices.

1 Introduction
As technology continues to advance, computational de-
vices will increasingly permeate our everyday lives, plac-
ing more and more wireless computers into our environ-
ment and onto us. Many manufactures have predicted
that the increasing capabilities and decreasing costs of
wireless radios will enable common electronics in fu-
ture homes to be predominantly wireless, eliminating the
clutter of wires common in today’s homes. For exam-
ple, TVs, cable boxes, speakers, and DVD players could
communicate without the proximity restrictions of wires.
The changing technological landscape will also lead to
new computing devices, such as personal health moni-
tors, for us to wear on our persons as we move around
our community. However, despite advances in these ar-
eas we have only just begun to see the ﬁrst examples of
such technologies enter the marketplace at a broad scale.
While the Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp) revolution
will have many positive aspects, we must be careful to
not simultaneously endanger users’ privacy or security.
By studying the Sling Media Slingbox Pro,
the
Nike+iPod Sport Kit, and the Microsoft Zune, we pro-
vide a checkpoint of current industrial trends regarding
the privacy and security of this new generation of Ubi-
Comp devices. (The Slingbox Pro is a video relay sys-
tem; the Nike+iPod Sport Kit is a wireless exercise ac-
cessory for the iPod Nano; and the Zune is a portable
wireless media player.)
In some cases, such as our
techniques for inferring information about what movie
a user is watching from 10 minutes of a Slingbox Pro’s
encrypted transmissions, we present new directions for
computer security research. For some of our other re-
sults, such as the Nike+iPod’s use of a globally unique
persistent identiﬁer, the key privacy issues that we un-
cover are not new; but the ease with which we are able to
mount our attacks is surprising. This is particularly true
because we show that it would have been technically pos-
sible for the Nike+iPod designers to prevent our attacks.
In all cases, we use our results with these devices to
paint a set of research challenges that future commer-
cial UbiComp devices should address in order to provide
users’ with strong levels of privacy and security.
On Our Choice of Devices. The Slingbox Pro, the
Nike+iPod Sport Kit, and the Microsoft Zune represent
a cross-section of the different classes of UbiComp de-
vices one might encounter in the future: (1) devices that
permeate our environment and that stream or exchange

across wired and wireless connections and combining
them into a single reference trace per movie. These refer-
ence traces are collected into a database for future query
use.
(Figure 1 shows the raw 5 second and 100 mil-
lisecond throughput data for two wired traces of Ocean’s
Eleven.) Second, we describe a simple Discrete Fourier
Transform based matching algorithm for querying this
database and predicting the content being transmitted.
We test this algorithm on a dataset consisting of over
100 hours of network throughput data. With only 10 min-
utes worth of monitoring data, we are able to predict with
62% accuracy the movie that is being watched (on aver-
age over all movies); this compares favorably with the
less than 4% accuracy that one would achieve by random
chance. With 40 minutes worth of monitoring data, we
are able to predict the movie with 77% accuracy. For
certain movies we can do signiﬁcantly better; for 15 out
of the 26 movies, given a 40 minute trace we are able to
predict the correct movie with over 98% accuracy. Given
the simplicity of our algorithm, this indicates a signiﬁ-
cant amount of information leakage — a fact that is not
immediately obvious to the users, who likely trust the
built in encryption in the device to protect privacy.
Any transmission method whose characteristics de-
pend on the content that is being transmitted is suscepti-
ble to the kind of attack we have described. As the world
moves towards more advanced multimedia compression
methods, and streaming media becomes ubiquitous, vari-
able bitrate encoding is here to stay. Preventing informa-
tion leakage in variable bitrate streams without a signif-
icant performance penalty is an interesting challenge for
both the signal processing and the security communities.
More broadly, a fundamental challenge that we must ad-
dress is how to identify, understand, and mitigate infor-
mation leakage channels in the full range of upcoming
UbiComp devices.
1.2 The Nike+iPod Sport Kit
The Nike+iPod Sport Kit is a new wireless accessory for
the iPod Nano; see Figure 2. The kit consists of two
components — a wireless sensor that a user puts in one
of her shoes and a receiver that she attaches to her iPod
Nano. When the user walks or runs, the sensor wire-
lessly transmits information to the receiver; the receiver
and iPod will then interpret that information and provide
interactive audio feedback to the user about her work-
out. The Nike+iPod sensor does have an on-off button,
but the online documentation suggests that most users
should leave their sensors in the on position. Moreover,
since the Nike+iPod online documentation encourages
users to “just drop the sensor in their Nike+ shoes and
forget about it [36],” the Nike+iPod Sport Kit is a prime
example of the types of devices that people might even-

ilarity between the traces.
information; (2) devices that users have on their persons
all the time; and (3) devices that promote social interac-
tions. While there is no perfect division between these
different classes of devices (e.g., devices that users have
on themselves all the time may also exchange content
and promote social activity), there are unique aspects to
the challenges for each class of devices; we therefore
consider each in turn. Speciﬁcally, (1) we use the Sling-
box Pro as a vehicle to study the issues and challenges
affecting next-generation wireless multimedia environ-
ments, (2) we use the Nike+iPod Sport Kit as the ba-
sis for assessing the issues and challenges with devices
that we have on our persons all the time, and (3) we use
the Zune as a foothold into understanding the issues and
challenges with devices promoting social activity.
Below we survey our results and challenges for each
of these scenarios in turn, deferring further details to the
body of this paper.
1.1 The Sling Media Slingbox Pro
The Slingbox Pro allows users to remotely view (sling)
the contents of their TV over the Internet. The makers of
the Slingbox Pro are staged to introduce a new device,
the wireless SlingCatcher, which will allow Slingbox
users to sling video to other TVs located within the same
home, thereby making it one of the ﬁrst next-generation
wireless video multimedia systems for the home [40].
Since the SlingCatcher will not be commercially avail-
able until later this year, we choose to study the privacy-
preserving properties of a Slingbox streaming encrypted
movies to a nearby computer over 802.11 wireless.
We describe in the following sections a technique for
monitoring a network connection, wired or wireless, and
based on the rate at which data is being sent from one
device to the other, predicting the content that is being
transferred. Our method consists of two parts. First,
we describe a procedure for collecting throughput traces

tually ﬁnd on themselves all the time.
One well-known potential privacy risk with having
wireless devices on ourselves all the time is: if the de-
vices use unique identiﬁers when they communicate, and
if someone can intercept (sniff) those unique identiﬁers
from the communications, then that someone might learn
potentially private information about a user’s presence
or location. This someone might use that information in
ways that are not in a user’s best interest; e.g., a stalker
might use this information to digitally track one or many
people, a company might use this information for tar-
geted advertising, and a court might examine this infor-
mation when debating a contentious case. Location and
tracking issues such as these are broadly discussed in the
context of RFIDs [27], bluetooth devices [26, 44], and (to
a lesser extent) 802.11 wireless devices [15], and there is
a large body of UbiComp literature focused on privacy in
location-aware systems [5, 11, 12, 19, 20, 25, 22, 29, 34].
Given this broad awareness of the potential trackabil-
ity issues with wireless devices, and given media reports
that the Nike+iPod Sport Kit used a proprietary wireless
protocol [35] we set out to determine whether the new
Nike+iPod Sport Kit proprietary system “raised the bar”
against parties wishing to track users’ locations.
We describe the technical process that we went
through in order to discover the Nike+iPod Sport Kit
protocol in Section 3. The key discovery we found is
that not only does each Nike+iPod sensor have a glob-
ally unique identiﬁer, but we can cheaply and easily de-
tect the transmissions from the Nike+iPod shoe sensors
from 10–20 meters away — an order of magnitude fur-
ther than what one would expect from a wireless de-
vice that only needs to communicate from a user’s shoe
to the user’s iPod (typically strapped around the user’s
arm), and also signiﬁcantly further than the conventional
passive RFID. The Nike+iPod sensor also broadcasts its
unique identiﬁer even when there are no iPods nearby
— the user must simply be moving with a Nike+iPod
sensor in her shoe. To illustrate the ease with which
one could create a Nike+iPod tracking system, we devel-

device with wireless Internet capabilities.
(b) Our
Nike+iPod Receiver to USB adapter
oped a network of Nike+iPod surveillance devices, in-
cluding a $250 gumstix-based node. The gumstix uses
an 802.11 wireless Internet connection to dynamically
stream surveillance data to our back-end server, which
then displays the surveillance data in a GoogleMaps ap-
plication in real time.
We then describe cryptographic mechanisms that, if
implemented, would have signiﬁcantly improved the
Nike+iPod Sport Kit’s resistance to our tracking attacks,
albeit with the potential drawback of additional resource
consumption (e.g., battery life and communication over-
head). Our basic approach is to mask the unique iden-
tiﬁers so that only the intended recipient can unmask
them. Our solution, however, exploits the fact that
the Nike+iPod Sport Kit has a very simplistic commu-
nications topology — at any given time a Nike+iPod
Sport Kit sensors only needs to be able to communicate
with one receiver. The challenge is therefore to lift our
privacy-preserving mechanisms (or other mechanisms)
to a broader context with heterogeneous devices commu-
nicating in an ad hoc manner.
1.3 The Microsoft Zune
The Microsoft Zune is a portable digital media player
with one (currently) unusual feature: built in 802.11
wireless capabilities. The intended goal is to let users
wirelessly share pictures and songs with other nearby
Zunes — including Zunes belonging to total strangers.
As such, the Zune is arguably the ﬁrst major commer-
cial device with the design goal of helping catalyze ad
hoc social interactions in a peer-to-peer wireless envi-
ronment. (Strictly speaking, we have not read the Zune
design documents. Rather, we are inferring this design
goal from articles in the popular press and from other
publicly available information about the Zune [32].)
Unfortunately, just as it is possible for spammers to
send unsolicited or inappropriate emails to users, it is
possible for an attacker to beam unsolicited content to
a nearby Zune. This unsolicited content may be annoy-
ing, such as advertisements or propaganda, or malicious,
such as images or songs that might make the recipient

feel uncomfortable or unsafe.
Given the Zune’s goal of enabling ad hoc interactions,
the Zune cannot fall back on traditional mechanisms for
preventing unsolicited content, such as buddy lists for in-
stant messaging. Further, much of the research on social
interactions for ubiquitous devices is restricted to scenar-
ios where users have a hierarchy of social relationships
(e.g., friends and non-friends) [22], which is incompati-
ble with the assumed Zune design goals. Rather, in ap-
parent anticipation of such unsolicited content, the Mi-
crosoft Zune allows users to “block” a particular device
— a malicious individual might be able to get a user to
accept an image or song once, but the recipient should
be able to block the originating device from ever send-
ing the user other content in the future. Unfortunately,
we ﬁnd that it is easy for an adversary to subvert this
blocking mechanism, thereby allowing the adversary to
repeatedly initiate content pushes to the victim until the
victim walks out of range or turns off the wireless in her
Zune. While we describe techniques that would address
the above scenario in the particular case of the Zune,
the observations we make underscore two challenges for
UbiComp devices designed to enable ad hoc social in-
teractions: (1) how to technically implement a blocking
procedure or proactively protect against undesired con-
tent, especially among a set of heterogeneous devices,
and (2) how to balance the blocking mechanisms with
our desire to protect location privacy and avoid certain
uses of globally unique identiﬁers.
1.4 Organization and Remarks
We respectively discuss our analyses of the Slingbox Pro,
the Nike+iPod Sport Kit, and the Microsoft Zune, as well
as the associated research challenges, in Sections 2, 3,
and 4. We discuss related work in-line.
We stress that there is no evidence that Sling Media,
Apple, Nike, or Microsoft intended for any of these de-
vices to be used in any malicious manner. Neither Sling
Media, Apple, Nike, nor Microsoft endorsed this study.
2 The Slingbox Pro: Information Leakage
and Variable Bitrate Encoding
Although the future of home entertainment is somewhat
fuzzy, many companies have predicted the future home
to be a wireless one. Wireless devices tend to be easier
to install (though not necessarily easier to setup), pro-
vide the user with more ﬂexibility, allow the devices to
interoperate with other technologies, and reduce clutter
from wires. While it is currently easier to simply plug
these devices in once and forget about them, future wire-
less technologies promise an ever increasing amount of
bandwidth, range, and decreasing manufacturing costs,
making them more appealing and more likely to be in-
cluded in future products. Consider, for example, the
buzz associated with the upcoming SlingCatcher and the
Apple TV; the former is expected to feature integrated
wireless support; the latter currently does. In addition to
the drive for devices to be connected together, wirelessly,
in the home, these devices are often ﬁnding themselves
networked together and connected to the Internet.
Protecting our private information becomes increas-
ingly difﬁcult as we begin to continually use more wire-
less devices. Devices in our homes could leak pri-
vate information to wireless eavesdroppers or, when us-
ing home devices over the Internet, wired eavesdrop-
pers. We have investigated one such new wireless/remote
TV viewing application — the Slingbox Pro — from a
privacy standpoint.
In doing so we have uncovered a
new information leakage vector for encrypted multime-
dia systems via variable bitrate encoding.
2.1 Slingbox Pro Description
The Slingbox Pro is a networked video streaming de-
vice built by Sling Media, Inc. It is capable of stream-
ing video using its built in TV tuner or one of four in-
puts connected to DVD players, cable TV, personal video
recorders, built in TV tuner, etc. and controlling these
devices using an IR emitter. The device itself has no
hard drive and cannot store media locally, relying on the
connected devices to provide the video and audio con-
tent. Paired with player software, called SlingPlayer, the
