Confirm system compatibility: Before upgrading the kernel, you need to confirm that the system is compatible with the kernel version to be upgraded. It can be determined by consulting the manufacturer's support documents or community discussions. 3. Download the new kernel: Download the new kernel version and unzip the file. 4. Install compilation tools: Install compilation tools, such as gcc, make and their dependencies. 5. Compile the kernel: use the compilation tool to compile the new kernel into a usable image file. 6. Change the bootloader: Add a new kernel image file to the bootloader. 7. Restart the system: Restart the system and select a new kernel to start. If something goes wrong, you can reboot by selecting an older kernel version. 8. Test: Test that the new kernel works and check for any bugs or incompatibilities. 9.
