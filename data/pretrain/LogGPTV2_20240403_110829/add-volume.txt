### Adding Volumes to the Shadow Copy Set

The `add volume` command is used to include volumes in the Shadow Copy Set, which is the collection of volumes that will be shadow copied. When a shadow copy is created, an environment variable links the alias to the shadow ID, allowing the alias to be used for scripting.

#### Volume Addition Process
- Volumes are added one at a time.
- Each volume is checked to ensure that the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) supports shadow copy creation for that volume.
- This check can be invalidated by subsequent use of the `set context` command.

This command is essential for creating shadow copies. If no parameters are provided, the `add volume` command displays help at the command prompt.

#### Syntax
```plaintext
add volume <volume> [provider <provider_id>]
```

#### Parameters
- **<volume>**: Specifies the volume to add to the Shadow Copy Set. At least one volume is required for shadow copy creation.
- **[provider <provider_id>]**: Specifies the Provider ID for a registered provider to use for creating the shadow copy. If not specified, the default provider is used.

#### Examples
1. **Viewing Registered Providers**:
   To view the current list of registered providers, type the following at the `diskshadow>` prompt:
   ```plaintext
   diskshadow> list providers
   ```
   Example output:
   ```plaintext
   * ProviderID: {b5946137-7b9f-4925-af80-51abd60b20d5}
       Type: [1] VSS_PROV_SYSTEM
       Name: Microsoft Software Shadow Copy provider 1.0
       Version: 1.0.0.7
       CLSID: {65ee1dba-8ff4-4a58-ac1c-3470ee2f376a}
   1 provider registered.
   ```

2. **Adding a Volume and Assigning an Alias**:
   To add drive C: to the Shadow Copy Set and assign an alias named `System1`, use the following command:
   ```plaintext
   add volume c: alias System1
   ```

By following these steps, you can effectively manage the volumes in your Shadow Copy Set and create shadow copies as needed.
