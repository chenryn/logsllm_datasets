Abstract. Several broadband providers have been oﬀering community
WiFi as an additional service for existing customers and paid subscribers.
These community networks provide Internet connectivity on the go for
mobile devices and a path to oﬄoad cellular traﬃc. Rather than deploy-
ing new infrastructure or relying on the resources of an organized com-
munity, these provider-enabled community WiFi services leverage the
existing hardware and connections of their customers. The past few years
have seen a signiﬁcant growth in their popularity and coverage and some
municipalities and institutions have started to consider them as the basis
for public Internet access.
In this paper, we present the ﬁrst characterization of one such ser-
vice – the Xﬁnity Community WiFi network. Taking the perspectives of
the home-router owner and the public hotspot user, we characterize the
performance and availability of this service in urban and suburban set-
tings, at diﬀerent times, between September, 2014 and 2015. Our results
highlight the challenges of providing these services in urban environ-
ments considering the tensions between coverage and interference, large
obstructions and high population densities. Through a series of controlled
experiments, we measure the impact to hosting customers, ﬁnding that
in certain cases, the use of the public hotspot can degrade host network
throughput by up-to 67 % under high traﬃc on the public hotspot.
1 Introduction
The impressive growth in the number of mobile devices and our dependance
on them and the services they support have created a high demand for Internet
connectivity on the go. Several large network providers including Comcast, Time
Warner, British Telecom (UK), and Orange (France) have started addressing
such demand by deploying millions of WiFi hotspots around the globe, as a free
service to existing customers or as an additional source of revenue.
Rather than deploying new infrastructure or relying on the resources of an
organized community [8], these provider-enabled community WiFi services lever-
age the existing hardware and connections of their customers for coverage. In
these networks, residential and commercial customers’ access points broadcast
an additional public hotspot SSID to bootstrap coverage of the community WiFi
network. Despite their rapid growth and extensive media coverage, we lack an

understanding of the eﬀective value of these community network service for con-
sumers, and the impact - if any - of their use on the residential customers they
rely upon.
In this paper, we present the ﬁrst characterization of a provider-enabled com-
munity WiFi network, focusing on the Xﬁnity Community WiFi. Xﬁnity WiFi is
the largest of such networks available in the U.S. with over 10 million devices in
July 2015 [24]. Taking the perspectives of both the home router owner and the
public hotspot user, we characterize the coverage, availability, and performance
of this service under various geographic and temporal contexts, over three weeks
in 2014 and six weeks in 2015. We performed controlled experiments to measure
the impact of concurrent access of both the home network and the public Xﬁnity
WiFi hotspot. Our results highlight the challenges of providing these community
WiFi services in urban and suburban settings considering the tensions between
coverage and interference in high population densities.
Key Findings. First, we found signiﬁcant growth in the Xﬁnity WiFi network in
all areas measured during the period of our study. Much of this growth was in the
number of from access points starting to broadcast in the 5 GHz band, particular
in our urban environment where 45 % of access points use 5 GHz (compared to only
15 % in the measured suburban one). Second, despite the higher number of Xﬁnity
WiFi access points, we found it challenging connecting to these access points for
Internet connectivity. After examining the signal strength and interference in each
environment, we found much lower signal strength and higher interference levels
in our urban setting measurements, compared with the suburban ones, which par-
tially explain the observed diﬀerences in connectivity and performance. Last, we
found signiﬁcant performance degradation of the hosting customer’s home net-
work with throughput reaching to half of the maximum attainable throughput for
4 Mbps traﬃc on public WiFi. This appear to be caused not by the additional traf-
ﬁc on the link, but rather because of the competition with the hosted public WiFi
hotspot network for same radio device and spectrum.
2 Community Wiﬁ Networks
There has been a growing interest in providing public WiFi access from the pri-
vate sector, civil organizations and end users. As a notable example, the Elec-
tronic Frontier Foundation is one of the many sponsors of the Open Wireless
Movement [13], aimed at creating a network of volunteer-supported free and
open wireless Internet. Several router manufacturers are equipping routers with
additional “Guest” WiFi access point, allowing public access while isolating pub-
lic from home traﬃc. As another example, FON oﬀers access to a virtually global
WiFi network of “foneros” that support guest users in exchange for free roaming
and/or revenue from paid users [15].
Several municipalities around the world, sometimes in cooperation with the
private sector, have also begun providing free or fee-based access to city-wide
wireless networks. Chicago is coming up with the Chicago Tech Plan to build
a model for cities and technology for smart communities [22]. Other examples

include early eﬀorts such as the MIT RoofNet [4] and MadMesh [9], and the
Google’s public Wiﬁ in Palo Alto, CA.
Recently, Internet service providers such as AT&T, Comcast, Time Warner,
British Telecom (UK) and Orange (France) have also started to oﬀer public WiFi
hotspots for their existing customers. In the case of AT&T, for example, both
existing cellular and broadband customers have access to a nationwide network
of WiFi hotspots, labeled attwifi, located at AT&T retail locations, as well as
partnered businesses.
2.1 Xﬁnity WiFi - a Provider-Enabled Community WiFi
On June 10th, 2013, Comcast announced its plans to create millions of WiFi AP
available to its customers through a neighborhood hotspot initiative [10]. The
company started to enable a second xﬁnitywiﬁ SSID broadcast in their existing
customer gateways to act as a publicly accessible hotspot. The uniqueness of this
model comes from its customer-supported-and-provider-enabled approach, what
we call provider-enabled community WiFi, that allowed Comcast to bootstrap
hotspot coverage by leveraging the provided routers of existing commercial and
residential customers.
Since then the service has grown to include over 10 million public hotspots
in the US [24]. All Comcast users with XFINITY Internet Performance tier and
above can connect to these hotspots for free1, while non-Comcast customers can
purchase an XFINITY WiFi Access Pass with diﬀerent hourly, daily and weekly
durations [11].
3 Characterization of Xﬁnity WiFi Network
To understand the challenges of providing community WiFi services in urban
environments, we conducted a series of experiments in Chicago’s central business
district (The Loop) and in Evanston, one of its northern suburbs. We designed
our experiments to capture the experience of public users, taking measurements
from public areas surrounding Xﬁnity WiFi access points. In the following para-
graphs, we use results from a series of such experiments conducted over the
course of a year to discuss (i) the coverage of Xﬁnity WiFi, (ii) its availability
as a usable Internet connection, and (iii) its performance to users. Motivated
by the comparable poor connectivity and performance we observed in urban
Chicago, we investigate possible causes including radio interference and signal
strengths of deployed access points.
3.1 Data and Methodology
We measured the coverage, availability and performance of Xﬁnity WiFi using
an instrumented Samsung Galaxy S4 to continuously scan for available APs,

recording their signal strength, BSSIDs and channel, along with the device’s
current GPS location. When an available xfinitywifi SSID was found, the
tool attempts to connect to the one with the strongest received signal strength
(RSSI), and upon successful association and authentication, conducts network
performance measurements using the Network Diagnostic Tool (NDT) [18]2.
We conducted our experiments in two geographic areas, one in the high-
density urban environment of Chicago, IL and one in a mix of residential and
low-density commercial in Evanston, IL. Each area covers a similar surface – 4× 4
block area (0.13 sq. mi) and a 6× 4 block area (0.15 sq. mi) in Evanston and
Chicago respectively. We took our measurements at three separate times between
2014 and 2015: in September 2014, April 2015 and September 2015. In each
instance, we canvassed each area, walking the same path in 2 h intervals both in
the morning and evenings to capture peak and non-peak hours. Unless otherwise
speciﬁed, the results presented for availability and network performance come
from the September 2015 dataset.

urban Evanston.
3.2 Deployment and Coverage
We measured the growth in deployed Xﬁnity WiFi access points in both loca-
tions between September 2014 and September 2015, noticing a signiﬁcant growth
in both areas in the number of observed access points. We found that while
Evanston gained more overall access points, Chicago saw a much larger rela-
tive increase. Between September 2014 and 2015, the number of Xﬁnity WiFi
hotspots in urban Chicago has increased more than 7 times (from 22 to 164);
during the same period, the number of hotspots in suburban Evanston has nearly
doubled (from 181 to 342). Despite the large growth, we still observed twice as
many access points in Evanston than in Chicago in our ﬁnal measurement.
2 While NDT results on network properties have been questioned, we believe that the
gathered measurements should be consistent for comparisons between settings, and
2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands [7].

D.K. Jha et al.
Aside from the overall growth in the number of access points, we observed
a higher proportion of new 5 GHz band deployments over the year. Similar to
the results from total access points, we observed a much higher growth rate of
5 GHz hotspots in Chicago (around 45 %) compared with suburban Evanston
(15 %). Deploying hotspots using 5 GHz radio band in urban environments may
be driven by the assumption of lower radio interference.3
Geographic coverage is determined by dividing each measured area into a grid
of cells - each cell an area of 0.001 degree latitude by 0.001 degree longitude - and
searching for the presence of Xﬁnity WiFi access points in each. In September
2015, we found access points in over 70 % of areas in downtown Chicago, and
over 90 % of areas in Evanston.
3.3 Availability
The utility of community WiFi networks depends not only on the presence of
an access point, but in the ability of clients to successfully connect to them.
There are many reasons why a client could see the service SSID but be unable
to connect to it, such as low signal strength. In this section, we discuss results
from our measurements of service availability which we deﬁne as the percentage
of Xﬁnity WiFi access points that one can successfully connect to during an
experiment.
Overall, despite the extensive coverage and high density of the Xﬁnity WiFi
hotspot network, we found the service to be typically unavailable with our mea-
surement device unable to connect to the large majority of access points – 56 %
in Evanston and 87 % in downtown Chicago. Table 1 summarizes these ﬁndings,
organized by measurement location and radio band.

We ﬁnd that the Xﬁnity WiFi in Evanston displayed much higher availability
compared to downtown Chicago. Of 124 APs we attempted connection with in
Chicago, we were only able to connect with 10 (13 %) 2.4 GHz and 8 (16 %)
5 GHz hotspots. In Evanston, we successfully connected to a signiﬁcantly higher
fraction of access points – 66 (44 %) 2.4 GHz and 13 (33 %) 5 GHz networks.
There can be many external factors which explain the poor connectivity in
urban areas. We investigated how signal properties of these access points aﬀected

our availability results, looking at the RSSI of devices we issued connect requests
to Figs. 2a and b display the distribution of maximum signal strengths observed
for the set of Xﬁnity WiFi access points found in each radio band.
We noted a higher presence of Xﬁnity WiFi hotspots with strong signal
strength (broadcast RSSI) in suburban Evanston than in urban Chicago, which
partially helps explain the higher service availability observed in Evanston. The
impact of low signal strength on availability is clearly illustrated in Fig. 2c, which
shows the number of successful connections compared to the total attempts for
5 GHz access points in Chicago at diﬀerent signal strengths. The steep drop oﬀ of
successful attempts with decreasing signal strength – including the 4 % success
rate of 5 GHz APs with RSSI less than 80 – explains much of the low availability
seen in this setting.
Investigating Wireless Properties. After observing the low availability of
Xﬁnity WiFi access points in urban Chicago, we further investigated whether
