User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题want user will logout from shell on exit of bash script I want, when a linux user exits from a shell script, that it  also logs out from the bash shell.
Is this possible?

Assistant: Instead of starting the script normally, exec it instead. This will replace the login shell, so when the script finishes the user will be logged out.
