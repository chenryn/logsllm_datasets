The font rendering appears to be non-native. Specifically, on non-Retina displays with subpixel font rendering enabled, the fonts seem to be using a different rendering engine, possibly FreeType, and do not appear to be utilizing subpixel antialiasing. This results in a less polished appearance. I assume this issue is less noticeable on Retina displays?
