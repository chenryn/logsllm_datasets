$3,133.7, and $7,331 for bugs that they considered clever
or novel [21], and our dataset contains 31 such awards.
Additionally, one of PinkiePie’s Pwnium exploits led to
a full review of the Chrome kernel ﬁle API, which re-
sulted in the discovery of several additional vulnerabili-
ties [21, 51]. The Chrome security team missed all these
issues until PinkiePie discovered and exploited one such
issue [14]. We therefore hypothesize that:
Hypothesis 2 An increase in the number of researchers
looking for vulnerabilities yields an increase in the diver-
sity of vulnerabilities discovered.

severity bugs found by internal contributors.
4.1.5 Cost of rewards
Though the number of bounties suggests that VRPs pro-
vide a number of beneﬁts, a thorough analysis necessarily
includes an analysis of the costs of these programs. In
this section, we examine whether VRPs provide a cost-
effective mechanism for software vendors. We analyze
one ongoing cost of the VRP: the amount of money paid
to researchers as rewards for responsible disclosure. Run-
ning a VRP has additional overhead costs that our dataset
does not provide any insight into.
Figure 4 displays the total cost of paying out rewards
for vulnerabilities affecting stable releases. We ﬁnd that
over the course of three years, the costs for Chrome and
Firefox are similar: approximately $400,000.

far outweighs that of a single security researcher because
each of these VRPs ﬁnds many more vulnerabilities than
any one researcher is likely to be able to ﬁnd. For bugs
affecting stable releases, the Chrome VRP has paid 371
bounties, and the most proliﬁc internal security researcher
has found 263 vulnerabilities. For Firefox, these num-
bers are 148 and 48, respectively. Based on this simple
cost/beneﬁt analysis, we hypothesize that:
Hypothesis 3 A VRP can be a cost-effective mechanism
for ﬁnding security vulnerabilities.
4.2 External security researcher
We model the goal of an external security researcher as
follows: to make as much money as possible in as lit-
tle time as possible.7 The researcher can contribute to

Figure 4: Cumulative rewards paid out for Chrome (blue solid
line) and Firefox (red dashed line), excluding rewards for vul-
nerabilities not affecting stable versions.
Rewards for Development Releases Both Firefox and
Chrome issue rewards for vulnerabilities that do not af-
fect stable release versions, increasing the total cost of
the VRP beyond the cost of rewarding vulnerabilities af-
fecting stable releases. One potential drawback of such
rewards is that the VRPs awards transient bugs that may
never make their way into a user-facing build in the ﬁrst
place. On the other hand, such rewards could catch bugs
earlier in the development cycle, reducing the likelihood
of expensive out-of-cycle releases.
Figure 5 shows the cumulative rewards issued by each
of the two VRPs for vulnerabilities affecting stable re-
leases, vulnerabilities not affecting stable releases, and
the sum of the two. We observe that the Chrome VRP has
paid out $186,839, 32% of its total cost of $579,605 over
the study period for vulnerabilities not affecting a stable
release. The Firefox VRP has paid out $126,000, 22% of
its total cost of $570,000, over the study period for such
vulnerabilities.
Discussion The total cost of each of the two VRPs is
remarkably similar. Both spend a signiﬁcant fraction
of the total cost on vulnerabilities not present in stable
release versions.
4.1.6 Average daily cost
Figure 6 plots the average daily cost to date of each VRP
over time. We see that Chrome’s VRP has cost $485 per
day on average, and that of Firefox has cost $658 per day.
Discussion If we consider that an average North Amer-
ican developer on a browser security team (i.e., that of
Chrome or Firefox) would cost the vendor around $500
per day (assuming a $100,000 salary with a 50% over-
head), we see that the cost of either of these VRPs is
comparable to the cost of just one member of the browser
security team. On the other hand, the beneﬁt of a VRP

any VRP he chooses, each of which pays out according
to some rewards distribution. The researcher has some
perception of security of each product, which reﬂects the
expected amount of time the researcher will have to spend
to ﬁnd a vulnerability.
A rational strategy for the security researcher is to look
for products perceived to be insecure that also happen to
pay large bounties. This implies that a product with a
higher perceived security must pay relatively higher boun-
ties to encourage researchers to look for vulnerabilities in
it as opposed to in a different product that is perceived to
be less secure. We therefore hypothesize that:
Hypothesis 4 In an efﬁcient market with many VRPs
and ﬂuid reward structures, larger rewards reﬂect a
higher level of perceived security by the population of
researchers who contribute to VRPs.
4.2.1 Reward amounts
Our dataset provides insight into the distributions of re-
wards for two products. Firefox offers a standard reward
of $3,000 for all vulnerabilities. In contrast, the Chrome

Table 4: Percentage of rewards given for each dollar amount in
Chrome VRP.
VRP’s incentive structure provides different reward levels
based on a number of subjective factors like difﬁculty of
exploit, presence of a test case, novelty, and impact, all of
which is at the discretion of Google developers.
Table 4 depicts the reward amounts paid to external
researchers by the Chrome VRP. The majority of the
rewards are for only $500 or $1,000. Large rewards, such
as $10,000 rewards, are infrequent.
Discussion We hypothesize that high maximum rewards
entice researchers to participate, but low ($500 or $1,000)
rewards are typical, and the total cost remains low. The
median (mean) payout for Chrome bug bounty is $1,000
($1,156.9), suggesting that a successful VRP can be in-
expensive with a low expected individual payout. Much
like the lottery, a large maximum payout ($30,000 for
Chrome), despite a small expected return (or even nega-
tive, as is the case of anyone who searches for bugs but
never successfully ﬁnds any) appears to sufﬁce in attract-
ing enough participants. Bhattacharyya and Garrett [5]
explain this phenomenon as follows:
Lotteries are instruments with negative ex-
pected returns. So when people buy lottery
tickets, they are trading off negative expected
returns for skewness. Thus, if a lottery game
has a larger prize amount, then a buyer will be
willing to accept a lower chance of winning
that prize.
4.2.2 VRPs as employment
Our dataset also allows limited insight into how much
money independent security researchers make. Table 5a
displays the total amounts of money earned by each exter-
nal contributor to the Chrome VRP. Only three external
contributors (out of eighty two) have earned over $80,000
over the lifetime of the VRP, and an additional ﬁve have
earned over $20,000.

Table 5: Frequency distributions of total amounts earned by
external VRP contributors.
In contrast to Google Chrome, we see in Table 5b that a
single Firefox contributor has earned $141,000 ($47,000
per year) since the beginning of our study period. Ten
of this individual’s rewards, representing $30,000, were
for vulnerabilities that did not impact a stable release.
Six contributors have earned more than $20,000 via the
Mozilla VRP.
Discussion Based on the data from 2 VRPs, we hypoth-
esize that:
Hypothesis 5 Contributing to a single VRP is, in gen-
eral, not a viable full-time job, though contributing to
multiple VRPs may be, especially for unusually successful
vulnerability researchers.
4.2.3 Repeat contributors
Figure 7 shows the cumulative number of vulnerabilities
patched due to reports from ﬁrst-time VRP participants
and repeat participants. For both programs, ﬁrst-time
participant rewards are steadily increasing, and repeat
participant rewards are increasing even more quickly.
Discussion Both VRP incentive structures are evidently
sufﬁcient for both attracting new participants and contin-
uing to entice existing participants, though we do note
differences between Chrome and Firefox. Until recently,
repeat participants in Firefox’s VRP represented a rel-
atively small fraction of the number of awards issued.
