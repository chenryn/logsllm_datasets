Hello,

I am new to Flutter and encountered an issue while building my APK. During my first build, the `armeabi-v7a` library was included, but in my second build, it was replaced by `arm64-v8a`. As a result, my application cannot be installed on a ZenFone device, although it works fine on a Xiaomi device.

Here is a screenshot for reference:

My app only uses basic widgets such as `TextField`, `Button`, and `Scaffold`.

Is there a way to force the inclusion of the `armeabi-v7a` library?

Thank you for your help.
