Hi i'm new on flutter, when i'm building apk for the first time the
armeabi-v7a lib was there, but in my second time armeabi replaced by arm64.
zenfone cannot install my aplication, but its working on xiaomi.

my app only use simple widget like textfield, button, scaffold, nothing fancy.  
can use armeabi-v7a forcefully?
