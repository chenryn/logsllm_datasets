User: I installed both Python 2.7 and Python 2.6.5. I don't know what went wrong, but nothing related to Python seems to work any more. e.g. "setup.py install" for certain packages don't recognize the "install" parameter and other odd phenomena...
I would like to completely remove Python from my system.
I tried running the 2.7 and 2.6 msi files and choosing remove Python and then running only 2.6 and reinstalling it. Still stuff don't work.
How do I completely remove Python - from everything? (!)
I would not like to reinstall my entire machine just because of the Python install...
Assistant: Open CMD

To show all packages installed - pip list

To copy the packages name to a file - pip freeze > requirements.txt

To delete all packages - pip uninstall -r requirements.txt -y

Check all packages are removed - pip list

Uninstall pip and other remaining packages

Control panel > Uninstall > Python uninstall (from UI)
