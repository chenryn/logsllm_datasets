There seems to be a bug in the way React interfaces with controlled inputs of
type number
If the input contains an invalid number (let's say --2 or 2++), then trying to
clear the input value by setting it to an empty string does nothing.
You can check an example to reproduce there: https://jsfiddle.net/96bnn12r/2/  
The onChange handler will set the controlled value to the value returned by
ev.target.value.  
In the case of an invalid value, the input returns an empty string (as per
html spec https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#states-of-the-
type-attribute 4.10.5.1.12) so this should actually clear the input but the
invalid input stays.
When setting the input value to an empty string after entering an invalid
value, it should clear the input content not keep the invalid value.
Seen in React 0.14.8, 15.0.1, 15.1.0 on OSX Chrome v50, Firefox 46.0.1
