User: I have projects in C++, Java and Python. Projects in C++ export SWIG interfaces so they can be used by Java and Python projects.
My question is: what building mechanism can I use to manage dependencies and build these projects?
I have used SCons and GYP. They are fairly easy to use and allow plugins (code-generators, compilers, packers). I'd like to know whether there are alternatives, in particular with native support for C++, Java and Python.
I develop in Linux platform, but I'd like to be able to build in mac and win platforms as well.
Assistant: In Java world ant is "lingua franca" for build systems.
Ant supports a C++ task via ant-contrib - so you can compile your C++ code.
With Ant's exec task you can still run swig on C++ code in order to get the wrappers.
Then standard tasks as javac/jar can be used for java application build.
