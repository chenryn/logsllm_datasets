### Troubleshooting IBM MQ: Remote System and LU 6.2 Connection

1. **Verify Remote System Definitions:**
   - Ensure that the definitions of the remote system are correctly configured, as previously described.
   - Confirm that triggering is activated in the remote system.

2. **Check LU 6.2 Connection:**
   - Verify that the LU 6.2 connection between the two systems is not a single session. If it is, you will not be able to receive reply messages.

3. **Remote Queue Manager Verification:**
   - Ensure the queue on the remote queue manager exists, is not full, and can accept the message length.
   - If any of these criteria are not met, the remote queue manager will attempt to place the message on the dead-letter queue.
   - If the message length exceeds the maximum allowed by the channel, the sending queue manager will try to place the message on its dead-letter queue.

4. **Queue Fullness Check:**
   - Determine if the queue is already full, which could prevent an application from placing the required message on the queue.
   - If the queue is full, check if the message has been placed on the dead-letter queue.

5. **Dead-Letter Queue Header:**
   - The dead-letter queue message header (dead-letter header structure) contains a reason or feedback code explaining why the message could not be placed on the target queue.
   - For more information, refer to the MQDLH - Dead-letter header structure documentation.

### Mismatch Between Sending and Receiving Queue Managers

1. **Message Length Mismatch:**
   - Ensure the message length does not exceed the capacity of the receiving queue manager.
   - Check the console log for error messages related to this issue.

2. **Channel Definition Compatibility:**
   - Verify that the channel definitions of the sending and receiving channels are compatible.
   - A mismatch in the wrap value of the sequence number can stop the channel. Refer to Distributed queuing and clusters for more details.

### Data Conversion and Channel Configuration

1. **Data Conversion:**
   - If a message comes from a different queue manager, ensure that the CCSIDs and encoding are the same, or perform necessary data conversion.
   - Check the Format field of the MQMD structure to ensure it corresponds with the message content. If not, data conversion might have failed.

2. **Fast Delivery of Nonpersistent Messages:**
   - If your channel is defined for fast delivery of nonpersistent messages (NPMSPEED set to FAST), and the channel stops and restarts, nonpersistent messages might be lost.
   - For more information, refer to the Nonpersistent message speed (NPMSPEED) documentation.

### Channel Exit and Message Grouping on z/OS

1. **Channel Exit Impact:**
   - A channel exit, such as a security exit, might cause unexpected processing, preventing the channel from starting or terminating it.
   - Check for any channel exits that might be causing issues.

2. **Message Grouping on z/OS:**
   - Ensure all messages in the group are on the queue.
   - Set the appropriate MsgFlags in the message descriptor to indicate the last message in the group.
   - Ensure the message expiry interval is long enough to prevent messages from expiring before they are retrieved.
   - If messages from the group have already been retrieved and the get request is not in logical order, disable the option to wait for a complete group when retrieving the remaining messages.

### Finding Messages in Cluster Queues and IBM MQ-IMS Bridge

1. **Cluster Queues:**
   - Use the DISPLAY QUEUE command to request information about cluster queues.
   - Use the MQPMO structure to determine the destination of the message.

2. **IBM MQ-IMS Bridge:**
   - Verify that the IBM MQ-IMS bridge is running.
   - Issue the `DISPLAY QSTATUS(qname) IPPROCS CURDEPTH` command to check the status of the bridge queue.
   - If IPPROCS is 0, check if the queue is a bridge queue, if IMS is running, if OTMA is started, and if IBM MQ is connected to OTMA.

### Unexpected or Corrupted Messages on z/OS

1. **Application Changes:**
   - Ensure that changes to applications or copybooks are reflected on all relevant systems.
   - Recompile both applications if a copybook has been changed.

2. **Incorrect Queue Usage:**
   - Verify that the application is not sending messages to the wrong queue.
   - Adjust security definitions to prevent unauthorized applications from accessing the wrong queues.

3. **Trigger Information:**
   - Ensure that the trigger information for the queue is correctly specified.
   - Verify that the correct application is being started.

### Capturing SMF Data for the Channel Initiator (CHINIT)

1. **Channel Accounting:**
   - Ensure that the STATCHL parameter is set correctly at the queue manager or channel level.
   - For client channels, set STATCHL at the queue manager level.
   - For automatically defined cluster sender channels, set the STATACLS queue manager attribute.
   - Enable TRACE(A) CLASS(4) to collect channel accounting data.

2. **CHINIT Statistics:**
   - Enable TRACE(S) CLASS(4) to gather CHINIT statistics SMF data.
   - Check the STATIME and ACCTIME parameters using the DISPLAY SYSTEM command.
   - Issue the MVS command `D SMF,O` to check the MAXDORM value, which indicates how long SMF can hold data in memory before writing it out.

### Contacting IBM Support

1. **Support Resources:**
   - Visit the IBM Support Site for help with IBM MQ issues.
   - Subscribe to notifications for IBM MQ fixes, troubleshooting, and other news.
   - Open a case through the IBM Support Site if you need further assistance.

2. **Collecting Troubleshooting Information:**
   - Use the `runmqras` command to gather troubleshooting information into a single archive.
   - Ensure your environment is set up correctly for the `runmqras` command.
   - If `runmqras` cannot be used, collect the information manually as described in the documentation.

By following these steps, you can effectively troubleshoot and resolve common issues in IBM MQ.
