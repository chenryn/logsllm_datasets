cloud services to host part of their malicious infrastructure,
including exploit servers to distribute malware and C&C
servers to manage infected terminals. Our work comple-
ments the insights obtained by these works by analyzing the
factors that drive attackers to choose certain type of hosting
provider.
A second strand of work has developed approaches to bet-
ter detect botnet infrastructure. Cyberprobe [30] describes
an active probing approach for detecting malicious servers
and compromised hosts. ASwatch [22] aiming at detect-
ing and identifying malicious ASes that exhibit “agile” con-
trol plane behavior (e.g., short-lived routes, aggressive re-
wiring). In this context, fast ﬂux also appears as a technique
that uses compromised computers to provide scalability, ge-
ographic diversity, anonymity and redundancy to organized
cybercrime operators. The fast ﬂux infrastructure relies on
computing resources stolen from the unwitting users of in-
fected endpoints. Cybercriminals rent these fast ﬂux proxy
networks to create a proﬁtable black market hosting envi-
ronment. The authors of [8, 44] have analyzed the struc-
tural relationships (domain, nameserver, IP connectivity) of
fast-ﬂux botnets and identiﬁed recurrent structural clusters
across diﬀerent botnet types. In [8], the authors have used
a social network connectivity metric to show that {Com-
mand and Control and phishing} and {malware and spam
botnets} have similar structural scores using the proposed
metric. In this paper, we have deﬁned metrics to capture
not only the attacker behavior but also the hosting provider
eﬀort toward mitigating the malicious infrastructure located
in their networks.
A third strand of work is the development of reputation
systems for providers, especially focused on those that fa-
cilitate cybercrime [23, 31, 35]. For example, FIRE [35]
introduced a ranking system using uptime of botnet host-
ing services to identify and expose providers that demon-
strate persistent, malicious behavior. In [31] the authors
propose various reputation metrics based on the concentra-
tion of abuse, while taking some structural hosting provider
characteristics into account. During the explanatory analy-
sis conducted in this paper, we use the structural properties
of hosting providers to assess the impact of these on their
security performance.
All these approaches help to identify and enumerate bot-
net C&C infrastructure and to describe their distribution
across networks and countries. We extend this related work
via explanatory analysis to determine the driving factors
for the locations of the C&C infrastructure in the hosting
market. We statistically model and explain the distribution
of C&C from the structural properties of hosting providers,
business models and factors like rule of law. We expand
the work by Ga˜n´an et al. [15] by studying the properties of
providers hosting C&C domains.
Hosting providers play a key role in the size and spread
of these botnets. Diﬀerent abuse reporting strategies have
been proposed and evaluated to analyze the performance of
hosting providers [11, 19, 29]. However, as shown by Canali
et al. [10], hosting providers are often not taking appropri-
ate measures, probably due to a lack of incentives. Mil-
lions of websites are often poorly managed by inexperienced
users, shared web hosting providers have not developed reli-
able mechanism to keep their users safe. Moreover, with the
emergence of cloud providers, attackers have a new platform
to host their infrastructure. Current studies have shown that
these type of providers are being used to launch long-tail
spam campaigns because of their low cost [25,36]. Only a few
speciﬁc providers have attempted to create added value by
providing “add-on” security services. For instance, a Dutch
web hosting provider [13] has added a free automated web-
site vulnerability scanning, ﬁxing and recovery service.
On the other end of the spectrum there are hosting pro-
[22, 40, 41]. Re-
viders acting as cybercrime facilitators
searchers and law enforcement agencies are searching better
ways at squashing these providers. While these eﬀorts are
critical for the overall ﬁght against cybercrime, our analysis
suggests that the C&C of the botnets engaged in attacks on
ﬁnancial services do not depend on malicious hosting provi-
ders, nor do attackers seem to prefer these providers when
locating their C&C.
7. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
Over the years, hosting providers have spent a great deal
of eﬀort taking down C&C infrastructure for botnets en-
gaged in attacks on ﬁnancial services.
This paper aimed to enlighten the strategies of the at-
tackers using these botnets for the placement of their C&C
servers across the hosting market. More speciﬁcally, we ex-
amined if attackers have shown a preference for providers
with lax security eﬀorts. Or, conversely, whether the place-
ment choice of C&C domains is rather randomly distributed
across the hosting space, as measured via the provider’s
structural properties
We studied seven years of C&C data for 26 botnet families
engaged in attacks on ﬁnancial services and demonstrated a
general increase in the total number of providers hosting
C&C domains over time. We also found a dynamic pattern
of providers who enter and exit the population of providers
that host ﬁnancial malware C&C.
Our results show that C&C abuse is highly concentrated
in a small number of providers. That being said, this concen-
tration can be explained from relatively large portion that
these providers have of the overall attack surface of the host-
ing market.
To study the eﬀect of hosting provider characteristics on
C&C concentrations, we modeled the distribution of C&Cs
using Generalized Linear Models (GLM), with C&C counts
following a Poisson distribution. We showed that a provider’s
attack surface characteristics such as IP and domain space
size and the proportion of shared hosting can explain around
71% of the variance in the number of C&Cs per provider.
The rule of law in a country only explains an additional 1%
of the variance, suggesting that the attackers do not prefer
providers in jurisdictions with weak law enforcement. All
in all, the selection process for C&C seems to be random:
the probability of hosting C&C is highly proportional to the
attack surface of the providers, as measured the by observed
eﬀect of indicators of size of the provider.
In addition, business model characteristics of providers
584show a signiﬁcant relation with C&C concentrations for a
sample of hosting providers. While the pricing of a hosting
plan negatively aﬀects C&C concentrations, provider’s pop-
ularity, time in business and the ratio of vulnerable software,
have a signiﬁcant positive relation with C&C concentrations.
Despite statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences in C&C take-
down speeds among providers, when modeled in conjunction
with attack surface variables, take-down speed shows only
a very weak relation with the concentration of C&Cs across
providers, suggesting that attackers are rather impervious
to the take-down eﬀorts of hosting providers.
On a more general level, our results suggest that the amount
of C&C abuse in the network of a provider is a function of a
provider’s structural properties such as its size and its pric-
ing strategy, rather than being driven by the eﬀort they put
in abuse handling.
Additionally, our approach helps in developing evidence-
based policies in the hosting market. That is, we demon-
strate an approach that enables better comparative abuse
metrics by controlling for the structural diﬀerences among
providers, rather relying on absolute counts.
Our work comes with a set of limitations as well. The
dataset contains only malware families that have been used
to attack ﬁnancial institutions. Some are predominantly
used for this purpose, like Citadel, but others are much more
generic malware families. Although our methodology in gen-
eralizable, it is an open question whether the patterns we
found are diﬀerent for diﬀerent kinds of abuse data. Future
work could explore this.
In addition, our uptime analysis
can contain biases from unknown measurement errors in the
ﬁrst-seen and last-seen observations of C&C domains. Such
observations are known to be quite noisy. We do however
think that the eﬀects would be negligible since the biases (if
any) would be systematic. Finally, because we have used
pooled data for the whole measurement period, our models
do not account for changes of C&C counts over time. Future
work can look into whether these patterns we discussed in
this paper change over time.
