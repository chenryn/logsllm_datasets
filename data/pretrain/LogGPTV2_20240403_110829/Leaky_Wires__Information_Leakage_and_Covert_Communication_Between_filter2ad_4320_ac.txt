transmitter quickly through a 4-bit pattern at 100MHz. We test
six different 4-bit patterns, only updating the looped pattern at
each new sampling period. For example, for the pattern 1100 (d2 in
Figure 4), the transmitter would stay high for two 100 MHz clock
ticks, then low for two clock ticks, then back to high for 2 ticks, etc.,
until the end of the sampling period. The six 4-bit patterns used
are: d0 = 0000, d1 = 1000, d2 = 1100, d3 = 1010, d4 = 1110, and
d5 = 1111. These patterns respectively have a HW of 0, 25, 50, 50,
75, and 100%, while their switching frequencies are 0, f = fCLK/8,
f , 2f , f , and 0 respectively.
Figure 6 shows the average count Ci of the ring oscillator for
each of pattern di. We see that the RO frequency increases with the
Hamming Weight, so that C0  vr , where ∆RC remains constant. The reason for this pattern
is that there is no additional overlap between the newly added
segments of the transmitter and the receiver.
We also identify the effect of a given number of transmitter
wires vt on receivers using a different number of longs vr . Among
receivers with vr ≥ vt , a smaller vr results in a larger effect. As
an example, for vt = 3, the effect for vr = 5 is smaller than it
is for vr = 3. This behavior is due to the transmitter affecting
only the first vt out of vr long wire segments of the ring oscillator.
For smaller ring oscillators, these vt segments represent a larger
portion of the number of wires used, and hence of overall delay.
The opposite is true when vr ≤ vt : the larger the RO, the bigger
the resulting effect. For instance, for vt = 4, the effect for vr = 3
is larger than the effect for vr = 1. This difference exists because
even though the delay of the routing scales linearly, the delay
associated with the inverter and buffer LUT stages remains constant.
Thus, the routing delay represents a larger fraction of the overall
delay (routing delay plus stage delay) for larger ROs. Since this
phenomenon only acts on routing delay, larger ROs are affected
more than shorter ones.
8 LOCATION INDEPENDENCE
In order to validate the location independence of the channel, we
test three different aspects of the placement of the receiver and
transmitter on: the absolute location on the device, the relative offset
of the receiver and transmitter, as well as the direction of signal
propagation. Figure 10 shows the results for all three experiments on
the Virtex 5 devices, with 99% confidence intervals. At a high level,
the effect remains approximately constant for each device regardless
of the choice of parameters. Across devices, the absolute magnitude
of the effect varies slightly, but is otherwise almost the same. Any
variability across devices is to be expected, since manufacturing
variations are known to affect ring oscillator frequencies [9].
Figure 10a shows the results when an identical circuit is placed
on different locations of the device: the four corners (bottom/top
left/right) and the center. Both transmitter and receiver use 2 longs
each, and they are adjacent: when the receiver’s location is (xr , yr),
the transmitter’s location is (xt , yt) = (xr , yr − 1). Within a device,
the values are close, and there is no pattern in how the values change

between devices. Manufacturing variations within and between
devices can thus explain any variability.
The second experiment investigates the effect of the placement
of the receiver and the transmitter relative to each other. When the
receiver and transmitter have different lengths, it is possible for
the two circuits to have the same overlap, but a different starting
offset. This relative offset or (visually shown in Figure 11) also has
minimal effect on the channel. To test this hypothesis, we place a
transmitter made up of 5 longs at a fixed location on the device. The
receiver, which uses 2 longs, is placed adjacent to the transmitter,
but at an offset of or full long wires, allowing for four different
offset placements. This offset needs to correspond to full long wire
lengths due to constraints imposed by the routing architecture of
the device. Any other offset would increase the distance d between
the transmitter and receiver, which we investigate separately in
Section 9. Figure 10b presents the results of this experiment, which
show approximately the same consistency both within and between
devices as those of the previous experiment.
Note that the relative effect of placing the receiver at various
offsets forms a consistent pattern across devices. As an example,
the effect for an offset or = 3 is consistently stronger than it is for
or = 1. This pattern can be explained by the FPGA routing layout: as
mentioned in Section 2, the local routing used to get to the various
long wire segments is different between each test. Because the local
routing resources differ, the ratio between the delay incurred by
the long wire segments and the local routing resources changes.
Figure 12: Effect of the transmitter-receiver distance. Long
wires leak information up to two wires away. Distance is de-
fined as in Figure 11.
As will be discussed in Section 9, while the delay of the long wire
segments is affected by the transmitter, the local routing is not.
Using the same setup, and with an offset of or = 2 full long wires,
we change the direction of signal propagation for the transmitter
and receiver. In the previous experiments, both signals travelled
from the bottom of the device to the top. However, in the Virtex
5 architecture, VLONG wires are bi-directional, and can thus propa-
gate signals upwards or downwards. Figure 10c shows the results
for the 4 different orientations (receiver and transmitter down, re-
ceiver down/transmitter up, etc.). The relative count difference is
approximately the same for all configurations, although as with
the previous experiment, we notice a consistent ordering for the
four transmission directions across devices. Similar to the earlier
experiment, this pattern can also be explained by the routing layout.
The results of this section illustrate that only the long wires need
to be manually specified, while the registers, LUTs, and local routing
can be auto-placed/routed, further reducing the attack complexity.

10 EXPLOITING THE LEAKAGE
In this section we discuss exploiting the information leakage from
a theoretical perspective. In some cases (such as that of Figure 2), a
threshold is sufficient for distinguishing between 0s and 1s, but in
other setups (such as that of Figure 5), this separation might not
be as clear: the RO frequency may drift due to changes in environ-
mental conditions, such as temperature and voltage variation. We
first detail an encoding scheme that enables high-bandwidth covert
transmissions (Section 10.1), and then explain how to eavesdrop on
dynamic signals through repeated measurements (Section 10.2).
10.1 Covert Transmissions
To overcome the hurdle posed by local fluctuations, we propose
a Manchester encoding scheme, where 0s are transmitted as the
pair (0, 1), and 1s as the pair (1, 0). Since every pair contains each
bit once, one can decode the received pair (c0, c1) as a 0 if c0 < c1
and as a 1 otherwise. Using this scheme, transmissions lasting 82µs
using 2 longs as well as transmissions lasting 21ms using 1
3 of a
long are both recovered with accuracies of 99.0 – 99.9%, without
employing any error correction algorithms. Under this encoding
scheme, the bandwidth of the channel is 1/(2 · 82 · 10−6) = 6.1kbps.
To further distinguish between noise and legitimate transmis-
sions, we can introduce N -bit start- and end-of-frame patterns.
Assuming that the probability that c0 < c1 when no transmission is
taking place is 1/2 (i.e., each measurement is equally likely to be in-
terpreted as a 0 or a 1), then the probability that noise is interpreted
as a start-of-frame when no transmission is taking place is 2−N .
As the channel is resilient to noise (also see Section 9), noise will
not accidentally end a transmission early or introduce additional
errors while a transmission is taking place. N can thus be chosen
based on the desired application guarantees, which can include
