### Usage and Risks of Geolocation Data
Geolocation data can be used for more than just enabling geo-targeted advertisements. However, the potential dangers of geo-targeted ads, such as malicious use, are outside the scope of this paper. There have been notable demonstrations of how geolocation data can be exploited for harmful purposes.

### Device ID Permission
The Device ID permission is utilized by applications like Glow, Eve, What to Expect, and Pinkpad to obtain the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) of the device. This unique hardware serial number is likely used for advertising purposes. Since the IMEI remains unchanged under normal operation, it provides a highly intrusive method for tracking users, even after they perform a factory reset on their devices. Consequently, Google has discouraged the use of IMEI for advertising. As of this report, Eve has addressed this issue.

### Conclusion
Our preliminary analysis of some of the most popular women's health applications revealed numerous security and privacy issues, leading to a concerning view of the state of these applications. Several of the applications had severe privacy and security flaws, making them unsuitable for recommendation.

While our research is not exhaustive, there are many unexplored areas in these applications. For instance, Elvie transmits user passwords to the server as unsalted SHA1 hashes, which are easily crackable if intercepted. Even more alarming, Maya stores user passwords in plaintext and emails them to users upon request for a password reset.

On a more positive note, some applications performed well in our tests. Fertility Friend, for example, makes no third-party server contacts (except for YouTube for viewing tutorials) and has no apparent security flaws. Clue also appears to be relatively secure and offers a well-implemented feature for sharing the user’s cycle with others. However, many of these applications seem to have been developed hastily, often consisting of only a calendar, some basic calculation code, and an advertising library. While these applications may not have significant security vulnerabilities, they should not be relied upon for medical advice, and users should consider the amount of personal information that could be shared with third parties through their use.
