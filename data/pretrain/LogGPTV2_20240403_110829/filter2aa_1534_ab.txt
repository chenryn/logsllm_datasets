how this might be used other than to enable geo-targeted ads. The dangers of geo-targeted ads are
outside the scope of this paper, but there have been some stunning demonstrations of ​how they
can be used maliciously​.  
The Device ID permission is used by Glow, Eve, What to Expect, and Pinkpad to get the IMEI
 7
of the device. This is most likely used for advertising. Since the IMEI is unchangeable under
normal operation, it is a very intrusive method of tracking, allowing advertisers to continue
tracking a user even if they factory reset their devices. For this reason, Google has discouraged the
use of IMEI for advertising. Eve has fixed the issue as of this report.  
Conclusion 
The number of security and privacy issues that we discovered in just this cursory look at the few
most popular applications could lead one to a pretty grim view of women’s health applications.
Certainly several of the applications had severe privacy and security issues and could not be
recommended. 
Our research here is not exhaustive, and there are still many avenues of research in these
applications left unexplored. For example, Elvie sends the user’s password to the server as an
unsalted SHA1 hash. If passwords are stored this way, they would be easy to crack if someone
were to get ahold of the hashes. Even worse, Maya appears to store the user’s password as
plaintext, which is emailed to the user when they request a password reset.  
On the other hand, some of the applications did surprisingly well on our tests. Fertility Friend,
for example, makes no third party server contacts (except for YouTube for viewing tutorials) and
7 International Mobile Equipment ID - A hardware serial number uniquely identifying a phone.

has no obvious security flaws that we have found. Clue seems to be relatively secure and has a
well-implemented feature for sharing the user’s cycle with others. On the other hand, many of
these applications appear to have been written extremely quickly, consisting of no more than a
calendar, some code to calculate averages, and an advertising library. These applications aren’t
usually complex enough to have any serious security vulnerabilities, but they shouldn’t be relied
on for medical advice, and one should consider how much personal information could be sent to
third parties through their use.
