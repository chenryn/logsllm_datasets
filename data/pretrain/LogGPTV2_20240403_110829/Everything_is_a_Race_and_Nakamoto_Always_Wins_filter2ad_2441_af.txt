Hence, we can do a similar trick as was done for the probabilities
of Fj and Gj to obtain

−λa ∆P(E2).
Since the increase times of Dh and the inter-arrival times of
adversary arrivals are i.i.d, the growth processes of Dh and the
number of adversary blocks are time reversible. Hence, probability
of E3 approaches that of E′
2 from above as j → ∞. Then, for all j,
we can write
P( ˆFj) ≥ P(E3)P(E2) ≥ P(E

2)P(E2) ≥ e
−λa ∆P(E2)2
We now calculate the probability of the event E2. To aid us in
the calculation of P(E2), we construct a random walk S[n]. Here,
the random walk is parametrized by the total number of adversary
. S[n] stands for the dif-
arrivals and increases in Dh since time τ h

ference between the increase in Dh and the number of adversary
arrivals when there has been, in total, n number of increases in
Dh or adversary arrivals since time τ h
. Notice that when ∆ = 0,
j
Dh increases by one whenever there is an honest arrival. Hence,
S[n] simply counts the difference between the number of honest
and adversary arrivals when there are n arrivals in total. In this
case, S[n] jumps up by 1 when there is an honest arrival, and, goes
down by 1 when there is an adversary arrival. Since the event that
whether the next arrival is honest or adversary is independent of
the past arrivals, S[n] is a random walk when ∆ = 0.
On the other hand, when ∆ > 0, we have to construct a slight
different random walk S[n] for the difference between the increase
in Dh and the number of adversary arrivals due to the ∆ dependence.
Although this random walk has non-intuitive distributions for the
jumps, we observe that
(1) Expectation of these jumps is positive as long as
λa  0.
Finally, observe that the probability of S[n] hitting or falling
below 0 is exactly the probability of the event Ec2. Hence, P(E2) =
c > 0. Combining this observation with previous findings yields
the following lower bound for P(Fj|Uj):
P(Fj|Uj) ≥ e
where p > 0 does not depend on j. This concludes the proof.
−λa ∆P(Fj|Uj , Gj) ≥ e

C.2 Alternative Proof of Lemma 4.5
In this subsection, we give an alternative proof of Lemma 4.5. We
first present a proof sketch below:
First, in the Praos/SnowWhite model, each arrival of an adversary
block can increment the depth of each adversary tree by exactly one
although many copies of this block are mined. Hence, the adversary
trees grow with the same rate as the adversary’s mining rate, namely
λa. Second, we observe that in the long run, the honest tree Th
grows with rate λh/(1 + λh ∆). See Figure 3 for the relation between
adversary trees and the honest tree. Then, if λa  0 such that
