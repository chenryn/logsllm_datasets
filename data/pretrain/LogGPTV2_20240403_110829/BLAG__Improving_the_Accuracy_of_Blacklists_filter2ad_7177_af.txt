they would apply the same care to choose blacklists used by
BLAG. BLAG makes any polluted information less likely to
propagate than individual blacklists. The attacker would have
to carefully craft the polluted blacklist so that the servers
appear on the same blacklist as many malicious sources, and
their appearances do not resemble appearances of the known-
legitimate sources on MB. Otherwise, BLAG would be able
to identify and discard low-quality information. We leave the
exact handling of pollution attempts for our future work.
X. CONCLUSION
Blacklists are widely used by network operators, but they
usually miss many attacks. We have proposed BLAG– the sys-
tem that can identify high-quality pieces of information from
multiple blacklists, and aggregate them into a master blacklist,
with some IP addresses expanded into /24 preﬁxes. Such a
master blacklist could be useful for an emergency response to
a novel or large-scale attack. Overall, BLAG has higher recall
than any single blacklist or their naïve aggregation and has
95–99% speciﬁcity. BLAG also outperforms PRESTA+L, a
competing approach, by having higher speciﬁcity for the same
recall. We thus believe that BLAG could signiﬁcantly improve
network security, and produce higher-quality blacklists than
existing approaches.
