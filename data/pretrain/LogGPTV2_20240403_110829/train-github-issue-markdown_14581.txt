Suggest assign "Shift+Win+arrow" for Fancyzones and leave "Wim+arrow" with
system's twin zones, then I have 2 options at the same time, 2 half zones by
"Wim+arrow" , and 3 zones (or any others you want) by "Shift+Win+arrow".  
btw, I can drag and drop the board of both zone with "Wim+arrow" , but it need
3 actions by FancyZones.
Actually already suggested in issue #2342, the response was 'Regarding 'win +
shift + arrow', in 0.18 it will be optional.' but not find the settings?
