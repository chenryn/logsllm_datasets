**Title: Advanced Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Techniques and Scenarios**

**Introduction:**
This document outlines various Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) techniques, focusing on message mediation, tracking scenarios, and practical exercises. The content is curated by experts in the field, including @singe and @cablethief.

**Section 1: Message Mediation**
- **Key Concepts:**
  - **Mana Mostly Mediate:** Techniques for managing and mediating mischievous messages.
  - **PI:EMAIL:** Email-based tracking and interception methods.

**Section 2: Tracking Scenarios**

**Scenario 1: Snoopy**
- **Objective:** Intercept and analyze network traffic without being detected.
- **Strategy:**
  - **Donâ€™t go to them, make them come to you:** Use passive listening and deception to lure targets into your network.
  - **Enterprise EAP Networks:** Focus on Enterprise Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) networks for more sophisticated attacks.

**Scenario 2: EAP Association**
- **Objective:** Perform a MitM attack on an EAP network.
- **Steps:**
  1. **Association:** Establish a connection with the target network.
  2. **4-way Handshake:** Capture the 4-way handshake to authenticate the client.
  3. **Server Cert and Client Cert:** Obtain and use server and client certificates for authentication.
  4. **EAP Relay with Sycophant:** Utilize the Sycophant tool to relay EAP messages and maintain the MitM position.
  5. **Outer TLS Setup:** Set up an outer TLS layer to secure the communication.
  6. **MSCHAPv2 Challenge and Response:** Handle MSCHAPv2 challenges and responses to complete the authentication process.

**Scenario 3: Mallory in the Middle**
- **Objective:** Practice MitM techniques in a controlled environment.
- **Practical Exercises:**
  - **HW-less CTFs:** Participate in hardware-less Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions to hone your skills.
