User: I am writing and distributed image processing application using hadoop streaming, python, matlab, and elastic map reduce. I have compiled a binary executable of my matlab code using the matlab compiler. I am wondering how I can incorporate this into my workflow so the binary is part of the processing on Amazon's elastic map reduce?
It looks like I have to use the Hadoop Distributed Cache?
The code is very complicated (and not written by me) so porting it to another language is not possible right now.
THanks
Assistant: The following is not exactly an answer to your Hadoop question, but I couldn't resist not asking why you don't execute your processing jobs on the Grid resources? There are proven solutions for executing compute intensive workflows on the Grid. And as far as I know matlab runtime environment is usually available on these resources. You may also consider using the Grid especially if you are in academia.
Good luck
