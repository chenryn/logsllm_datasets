Question: "An e-commerce web application uses drop-down menus to allow users to select quantities of items for purchase. These quantities are defined server-side and are displayed as non-editable on the client-side. Which of the following scenarios poses a security risk that violates business logic integrity?"
 "A": "A user can view different quantities based on their membership level, and the server validates the quantity before processing."
 "B": "The server uses client-side drop-down values directly for processing orders without server-side validation."
 "C": "The server maintains a separate, server-side copy of the quantity and compares it with the client's selection before processing."
 "D": "The server restricts users from selecting quantities based on their account type and provides appropriate error messages."
Answer: B
