**Title: NetSpectre: A Truly Remote Spectre Variant**

Modern processors employ branch prediction and speculative execution to enhance performance. Since the disclosure of the Spectre attacks in January 2018, it has become evident that speculative execution can be exploited to leak confidential information. By inducing a victim to speculatively execute operations that would not occur during normal program execution, an adversary can extract sensitive data through a side channel.

Many countermeasures and workarounds have been proposed, typically assuming that Spectre attacks are local and require the attacker to execute code on the victim's machine. In this presentation, we introduce NetSpectre, a variant of the Spectre attack that can be executed remotely over the network. This new attack does not require any user interaction; it exploits Spectre-like gadgets exposed to the network.

We demonstrate the feasibility of NetSpectre by showing data leakage across virtual machines in the Google Cloud. We then discuss why existing Spectre mitigations are insufficient and do not prevent NetSpectre. By introducing a novel variation of Spectre that leverages a previously unknown side channel, we highlight the inadequacy of many current countermeasures, rendering them ineffective.

Our findings underscore the need for further research into such attacks to develop more robust defenses. We outline the challenges for future research on Spectre attacks and their mitigations. Finally, we will explore the short-term and long-term implications of both Spectre and NetSpectre for hardware vendors, software developers, and end-users.
