When using the `yum` module to install a package on RHEL6, I encountered the following error:

```
fatal: [jofo-mgmt1] => failed to parse: This system is not registered with RHN.
RHN support will be disabled.
{"changed": true}
```

These messages are consistently displayed by `yum` on the machine unless the RHN plugin is disabled using the `--disableplugin=rhnplugin` option. Alternatively, registering the machine with RHN could resolve the issue, but this would be impractical in this case, as the machine is a disposable VM within an OpenNebula cluster.
