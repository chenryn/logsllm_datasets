when using the "yum" module to install a package in RHEL6, I just get this
error:
fatal: [jofo-mgmt1] => failed to parse: This system is not registered with
RHN.
RHN support will be disabled.
{"changed": true}
These lines are always printed by yum on the machine, unless the RHN plugin is
disabled with "--disableplugin=rhnplugin", or, I guess, by registering the
machine with RHN. However, the latter would probably be impractical since it's
actually a disposable VM in a opennebula cluster.
