3.1 Brake-by-wire system  
A  distributed  architecture  for  a  brake-by-wire 
system can be implemented according to Figure 4. The 
brake  pedal  is  connected  to  a  central  unit  (CU).  The 
central  unit  handles 
the  all-embracing  control, 
distributing the correct brake force to each wheel node 
(WN).  The  control  algorithms  in  the  individual  wheel 
nodes  then  ensure  that  the  requested  brake  force  is 
applied  to  the  respective  wheel  in  the  most  favorable 
way. 
The  architecture  considered  consists  of  one  duplex 
configuration  for  the  central  unit  and  a  simplex 
configuration  in  conjunction  with  a  brake  actuator  for 
each  wheel.  A  simplex  configuration  is  used  for  the 
wheel  nodes  in  order  to  reduce  equipment  costs.  This 
configuration  may  be  used  since  the  driver  can  still 
brake  the  vehicle  if  one  wheel  node  fails.  That  is,  the 
system  can  change  to  a  degraded  functionality  mode 
where  the  brake  force  is  distributed  to  the  remaining 
fault-free  wheel  nodes  after  a  node  failure.  However, 
the  efficiency  of  the  brakes  will  be  substantially 
degraded. Thus it is desirable to reduce the probability 
of entering the degraded functionality mode.

3.2 Reliability Modeling 
We  evaluate  the  reliability  of  the  brake-by-wire 
system in this study. The reliability, R(t), of a system is 
the  probability  that  the  system  is  operating  correctly 
throughout  a  specific  time  interval,  given  that  the 
system  was  operating  correctly  at  the  start  of  that 
interval. 
In  the  following,  the  BBW  architecture  will  be 
studied  with  respect 
to  both  full  and  degraded 
functionality.  Full  functionality  mode  refers  to  a 
requirement  that  all  wheel  nodes  and  one  central  unit 
node  must  function  correctly;  otherwise  a  system 
failure  has  occurred.  In  the  degraded  functionality 
mode, the requirement is that at least three wheel nodes 
and  one  central  unit  node  must  function  correctly; 
otherwise  a  system  failure  has  occurred.  To  simplify 
the  analysis,  only  the  nodes  of  the  BBW  system  are 
included.  Thus,  failures  of  the  actuators,  sensors  and 
communication busses are not considered. 
The reliability of the BBW architecture is calculated 
using the SHARPE (Symbolic Hierarchical Automated 
Reliability  and  Performance  Evaluator)  tool  [13]. 
SHARPE  allows  various  models  such  as  fault  trees, 
reliability  block  diagrams  (RBD)  and  Markov  models 
to  be  specified  and  dependability  measures  to  be 
obtained. 
3.2.1.  Description  of  nodes.  In  our  analysis,  we 
consider  both  permanent  and  transient  faults.  A 
permanent  fault  occurs  at  a  specific  time  and  remains 
in  the  system  requiring  the  faulty  component  to  be 
either repaired or replaced. A transient fault occurs at a 
specific  time  and  exists  only  for  a  limited  period  of 
time in the system.  
The fault rate (λ) of a node refers to the occurrence 
rate  of  activated  faults  in  the  node,  i.e.  faults  that 
generate  errors  in  the  node.  Faults  whose  effects  are 
overwritten or latent are not included in the fault rate. 
Two  types  of  nodes  are  considered;  fail-silent 
computer  nodes  (called  FS  nodes),  and  nodes  with 
light-weight  NLFT  (called  NLFT  nodes).  Their 
intended behavior in presence of errors is as follows: 
FS  nodes:  If  an  error  is  detected  by  one  of  the 
node’s  EDMs,  then  the  node  exhibits  a  fail-silent 
failure,  i.e.  the  node  immediately  stops  producing 
results  and  is  excluded  from  the  distributed  system. 
The  node  is  automatically  restarted,  and  a  diagnostic 
program establishes whether the failure was caused by 
a transient or a permanent fault. If the node is found to 
fault-free  by  the  diagnostic  test,  the  node  is  re-
integrated into the distributed system. 
and 
faults 
NLFT  nodes:  Transient 
their 
corresponding  errors  can  be  handled  in  three  ways:  i) 
the  error  is  masked  by  TEM,  ii)  the  error  is  detected 
and  an  omission  failure  occurs  or  iii)  the  error  is 
detected  and  a  fail-silent  failure  occurs.  An  omission 
failure occurs if there is not enough time to re-execute 
a task a third time before the task’s deadline, or if three 
different  results  are  produced  in  TEM.  A  fail-silent 
failure  occurs  if  an  error  is  detected  during  execution 
of  the  kernel.  Such  failures  are  handled  in  the  same 
way as in the case of FS nodes. 
Non-covered errors, i.e. errors that escape all EDMs, 
may  cause  both  the  FS  nodes  and  NLFT  nodes  to 
deviate  from  their  intended  behaviors.  We  make  the 
pessimistic assumption that all non-covered faults lead 
to a system failure of the entire BBW system.  
3.2.2.  Basic  assumptions  and  notations.  We  assume 
that  faults  occurring  in  one  computer  node  are 
statistically  independent  of  faults  occurring  in  other 
computer nodes. We also assume that the fault rate and 
the  repair  rate  are  constant  over  time,  i.e.  the  time  to 
failure  and  the  time  to  repair  are  exponentially 
distributed.  All  nodes  are  assumed  to  have  the  same 
complexity  and  exposure  to  the  environment,  and 
thereby  the  same  fault  rate.  The  repair  (recovery) 
action is assumed to be fault-free. Correlated faults are 
not considered. A correlated fault occurs when a single 
fault affects  more than one component at one point in 
time. Neither is repair of permanent faults considered. 
The following notations are used in the models:

Error  detection  coverage,  i.e.  the  conditional 
probability  that  an  error  is  detected  given  that  a 
fault has occurred. 
Given  that  an  error  caused  by  a  transient  fault  is 
detected,  this  denotes  the  probability  that  the 
system can mask the effect of the fault using TEM

3.2.3.  BBW  System.  A  hierarchical  approach  similar 
to [14] is used to construct the reliability model of the 
BBW architecture. Figure 5 shows the fault tree model 
that 
the  overall  system.  The  basic 
components of the fault tree are the central unit and the 
wheel  node  subsystem  that  consists  of  the  four  wheel 
nodes.  A  failure  of  any  subsystem  results  in  a  system 
failure.  The  hierarchical  approach  used  allows  the 
various  parts  of  the  system  to  be  assessed  separately 
and reliability bottlenecks to be identified.

When NLFT nodes are used, the effect of a transient 
fault is tolerated with the probability of PT, an omission 
failure  occurs  with  the  probability  of  POM,  or  a  fail-
silent  failure  occur  with  the  probability  of  PFS.  The
