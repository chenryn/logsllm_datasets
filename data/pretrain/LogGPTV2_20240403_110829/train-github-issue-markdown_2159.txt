The change introduced in `a108445` causes fields that were valid in 2.6.4 to
be invalid in 2.6.5.
When I revert that one commit in 2.6.5 the problem is fixed.
The error I get:
    Symfony\Component\Validator\ConstraintViolation
    Object(Symfony\Component\Form\Form).children[bundle] = 550fe15080c7e16f5b8b4da0
    Caused by:

    Unable to reverse value for property path "bundle": The choice "550fe15080c7e16f5b8b4da0" does not exist or is not unique

The following line does not convert multiple values into an `$in` query:
    $this->em->getRepository($this->class)->findBy(array($this->idField => $values));
