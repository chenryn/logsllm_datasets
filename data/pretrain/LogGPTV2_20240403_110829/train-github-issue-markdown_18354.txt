I finished the lesson, but I'm unable to progress. This happened with every
lesson in the jQuery section, but all the others finally worked after a dozen
clicks or thereabouts. The script runs correctly, and the hinge animated takes
place (wasn't able to puush fast enough to catch it in action). I'm going to
keep clicking in the hopes that it eventually works, but it is very
discouraging.
