### ATT&CK ID: T1491.002
### ATT&CK Technique Name: External Defacement

An adversary may deface systems external to an organization in an attempt to deliver a specific message, intimidate, or mislead the organization or its users. This type of defacement can ultimately erode user trust in the affected systems and cast doubt on their integrity. Externally-facing websites are frequent targets of such attacks, often carried out by adversaries or hacktivist groups to promote political messages or spread propaganda.

External defacement can serve multiple purposes. It may be used as a catalyst to trigger specific events or as a response to actions taken by an organization or government. Additionally, website defacement can act as a setup or precursor for future attacks, such as drive-by compromises.
