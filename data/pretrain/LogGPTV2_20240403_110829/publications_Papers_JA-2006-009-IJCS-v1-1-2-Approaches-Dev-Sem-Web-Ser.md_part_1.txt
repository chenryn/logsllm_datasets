An ontology is a shared conceptualization of the world.
Ontologies consist of definitional aspects such as high-level
schemas and assertional aspects such as entities, attributes,
interrelationships between entities, domain vocabulary and
factual knowledge – all connected in a semantic manner [10].
Ontologies provide a common understanding of a particular
domain. They allow the domain to be communicated between
people, organizations, and application systems. Ontologies
provide the specific tools to organize and provide a useful
description of heterogeneous content.
