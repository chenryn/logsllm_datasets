User:  How to deploy a Node.js-based web application on a Linux system?
Assistant: The following are the steps to deploy a Node.js-based Web application on a Linux system: 1. Install Node.js and npm. Node.js and npm can be installed using a package manager. On Ubuntu, the following commands can be used: ``` sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install nodejs npm ``` 2. Create a new Node.js application. In the terminal, enter the directory where you want to create the application, and execute the following command: ``` npm init ``` Follow the prompts to enter the application information. 3. Install the required dependencies. Install the dependencies required by the application via the following command: ``` npm install --save <package-name> ``` where `<package-name>` is the name of the desired package. For example, to install the Express framework, you can use the following command: ``` npm install --save express ``` 4. Write the application code. Create a file called `app.js` and write the application code. 5. Deploy the application to the server. Application code and dependencies can be packaged into a zip file and uploaded to the server. On the server, the zip file can be uncompressed with the following command: ``` unzip myapp.zip ``` 6. Start the application. Start the application with the following command: ``` node app.js ``` The application will run on port 3000. Enter the server's IP address and port number in a web browser to access the application. For example, `http://192.168.0.1:3000`.
