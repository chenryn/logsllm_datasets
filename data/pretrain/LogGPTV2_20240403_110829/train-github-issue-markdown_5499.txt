While reviewing the updates for Android P, I came across some relevant information that prompted me to share the following resources:

- [Getting Your Android App Ready for Android P](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/11/getting-your-android-app-ready-for.html)
- [Faster Logins with Password Autofill in iOS 11](https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/faster-logins-with-password-autofill-in-ios-11--cms-29096)

@Hixie, could you please provide your thoughts on whether this functionality should be handled by the framework or through plugins?
