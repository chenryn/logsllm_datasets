This presentation is not legal advice 
about your specific situation.
This presentation does not create an 
attorney-client relationship.
While these approaches are designed to 
reduce risk, they cannot eliminate it.

DEF CON 21
Risks in Disclosing or Selling
Research Examples:
You found out how to see other people’s 
utility bills by changing the http query string
You discovered your neighbor’s WiFi is 
using the default password
You broke the crypto protecting media
You wrote a better RAT
Many of the same risks apply

DEF CON 21
What are we talking about?
“Techniques”
Information relating to both exploits and vulnerabilities that enable another 
party to obtain unauthorized access to a computer, deny access by others to a 
computer, or cause permanent or temporary damage to a computer or a 
network
DEF CON 21

When is There Risk?
•Threats of with legal action before 
conference or disclosure
 Chris Paget (IOActive) (Black Hat) - 2007
 Princeton Prof. Felten (USENIX) - 2001
•Injunction barring disclosure before 
conference or disclosure
 Megamos (USENIX) - 2013 
 MIT - Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (DEFCON) -
2008

When is There Risk?
•Legal actions initiated after 
conference or disclosure
 Cisco - Michael Lynn (ISS) (Black Hat) 2005
 Civil lawsuit filed after talk
 Dmitry Sklyarov (DEFCON) 
 Taken into custody in Las Vegas after DEFON

DEF CON 21
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
Are you connected to the internet?
Are you accessing a remote system?
Do you have permission to access that 
system?

DEF CON 21
Conspiracy
to violate the CFAA
risk enhanced by social media

DEF CON 21
CFAA Risk Example Cases
• Criminal prosecution
 Nestor (exploited video poker bug [CFAA charge dropped])
 Nosal (terms of use [no CFAA violation, 9th Cir.]
 Aaron Swartz (spoofed MAC address)
 Andrew Auernheimer (conspiracy to script http queries to public 
API)
 “conspiracy to hack a honeypot may still violate the CFAA.” (DOJ 
CCIPS manual citing U.S. v. Schaffer)
• Civil prosecution
 Available on the same grounds to private parties

Risk Mitigation: CFAA

knowingly accessed a computer 
without authorization or exceeding 
authorized access…”

Risk Mitigation: CFAA
Avoid unintentionally creating
Knowledge

14
DEF CON 21
Risk Mitigation: CFAA
•Do not direct technique information to 
someone you suspect or should know is 
likely to use it illegally.
15
DEF CON 21
Risk Mitigation: CFAA
•Be careful in providing “support”.
“If I were your lawyer, I’d advise you 
not to answer that tweet.” 
16
DEF CON 21
Risk Mitigation: CFAA
• Consider not providing technique information directly to 
any individuals and limiting distribution to websites 
only.
• Do not promote the disclosure on forums known to 
support or promote illegal activity.
• If published on a website, consider disabling comments 
to avoid possibility of users discussing illegal use on 
your site.
• Do not maintain logs.
17
DEF CON 21
Risk Mitigation: TRO
• Goal: Avoid a Temporary Restraining 
Order (TRO)
Factors
(1) Will the requestor suffer irreparable 
harm if the TRO does not issue?
(2) Will there be even greater harm to 
the researcher if the TRO does issue?
(3) The public interest
(4) Likelihood requestor will ultimately 
prevail
18
DEF CON 21
Risk Mitigation: TRO
•Avoid use of copyrighted material.
 Exploit including source or object code from 
target may infringe copyright
 Megamos and Cisco plaintiffs cited 
misappropriation of intellectual property
 “Fair use” exception 
•Avoid darknet sources for proprietary 
or copyrighted material.
19
DEF CON 21
Risk Mitigation: TRO
•Be aware of any pre-existing 
relationships with possible targets of 
the technique.
Terms of Service (TOS), End User 
License Agreement (EULA), Non-
Disclosure Agreement (NDA), 
Employment Agreements

DEF CON 21
Risk Mitigation: TRO
•Necessity of risk mitigation depends 
on nature of research.
•If research techniques were 
questionable:
Do not publish identity of the target 
system.

DEF CON 21
Disclosure Options
22
DEF CON 21
Option #1
Disclose to responsible party
•Relatively high risk
if techniques used were questionable
if planning to present at a conference or 
publish (TRO)
•Risk lowered if
submitted anonymously and
OPSEC is good
•Relatively low risk if to a bug bounty 
and no questionable techniques used
23
DEF CON 21
Option #2
Disclose to gov’t authority
24
DEF CON 21
•Relatively high risk
if techniques used were questionable
anonymity is desired
•Risk lowered if
submitted anonymously and
OPSEC is good
Always Accept the Risk in 
Disclosing if You Are…
25
DEF CON 21
OK to Disclose

[REDACTED]
Option #3
Pilot TTP Disclosure Program
• Researcher discloses vuln to trusted third party 
(TTP attorney) only.
 Maintains attorney-client privilege
• TTP discloses vuln to responsible party.
• TTP [does | does not] publish the vuln on behalf 
of researcher after  y days. 
• Researcher can remain anonymous [temporarily 
| permanently].
• Researcher maintains control of disclosure 
process.

Selling: The Current Situation
28
DEF CON 21
The NDAA Senate Bill
“The President shall establish an 
interagency process to provide for the 
establishment of an integrated policy to 
control the proliferation of cyber 
weapons through unilateral and 
cooperative export controls, law 
enforcement activities, financial means, 
diplomatic engagement, and such other 
means as the President considers 
appropriate.”
29
DEF CON 21
The NDAA Cmtee Report
“The types of dangerous software used to 
perpetrate these malicious incidents are actively 
traded on a global black market, and they are also 
available in the so-called gray market, through 
unscrupulous companies.”
“This process will require developing definitions 
and categories for controlled cyber technologies 
and determining how to address dual use, lawful 
intercept, and penetration testing technologies.”
Senate Cmtee on Armed Services, National Defense Auth Act, June 20, 2013

DEF CON 21
The European Directive
Article 7
Tools used for committing offences
Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure 
that the intentional production, sale, procurement for use, 
import, distribution or otherwise making available, of one of the 
following tools, without right and with the intention that it be 
used to commit any of the offences referred to in Articles 3 to 6, 
is punishable as a criminal offence, at least for cases which are 
not minor:
(a) a computer programme, designed or adapted primarily for 
the purpose of committing any of the offences referred to in 
Articles 3 to 6;
31
DEF CON 21
The European Exception
Whereas:
(16)…Motivated by the need to avoid 
criminalisation where such tools are produced 
and put on the market for legitimate purposes, 
such as to test the reliability of information 
technology products or the security of 
information systems, apart from the general 
intent requirement, a direct intent 
requirement that those tools be used to commit 
one or more of the offences laid down in this 
Directive must be also fulfilled.”

DEF CON 21
Selling: Risk Mitigation
•Create dual-use tools.
Copy II Plus
•Know your buyer.
Avoid embargoed countries
EU, US, UN
•Ask for assurances from the buyer.
•Use disclaimer language.

DEF CON 21
Selling: Risk Mitigation
• Use disclaimers in correspondence and 
agreements
“Compliance with Law.   Customer acknowledges that the Software can be configured 
by the user to obtain access to information using penetration techniques that may 
cause disruption in systems or services and may cause data corruption.  Denial of 
Service attacks may be run on command that will attempt to render systems and 
services unavailable to authorized users. Customer specifically agrees that the 
Software will only be used to target devices under the authorized control of the 
Customer and in a way in which damage to systems or loss of access or loss of data 
will create no liability for [discloser/seller] or any third party.  Customer further 
agrees to strictly comply with all federal, state and local laws and regulations 
governing the use of network scanners, vulnerability assessment software products, 
hacking tools, encryption devices, and related software in all jurisdictions in which 
systems are scanned or scanning is controlled.”
“You also agree that you will not use these products for any purposes prohibited by 
United States law, including, without limitation, the development, design, 
manufacture or production of nuclear, missiles, or chemical or biological weapons.”
