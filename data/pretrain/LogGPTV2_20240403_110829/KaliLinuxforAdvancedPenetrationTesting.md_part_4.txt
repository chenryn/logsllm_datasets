installed on Kali with new versions available are upgraded. The upgrade
command will not change or delete packages that are not being upgraded,
and it will not install packages that are not already present.
[ 24 ]
Chapter 1
• apt-get dist-upgrade: This upgrades all packages currently installed on
the system and their dependencies. It also removes obsolete packages from
the system.
The apt-get command can also be used to show a full description of a
package and identify its dependencies (apt-cache show )
or remove a package (apt-get remove ).
Run the apt-get update command and the upgrade command at
start-up to ensure your session is using the most up-to-date tools. The
easiest way to do this is to create an update.sh script that includes the
following command line:
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade –y && apt-get dist-
upgrade –y
Some applications are not upgraded by the apt-get command. For example,
the local copy of the exploit-db archive must be manually upgraded. Create a
script named update.sh and add the following commands to it, to automate the
update process:
cd /usr/share/exploitdb
wget http://www.exploit-db.com/archive.tar.bz2
tar –xvjf archive.tar.bz2
rm archive.tar.bz2
Configuring and customizing Kali Linux
Kali is a framework that is used to complete a penetration test. However, the
tester should never feel tied to the tools that have been installed by default, or
by the look and feel of the Kali desktop. By customizing BackTrack, a tester can
increase the security of client data that is being collected, and make it easier to
do a penetration test.
Common customizations made to Kali include:
• Resetting the root password
• Adding a non-root user
• Speeding up Kali operations
• Sharing folders with MS Windows
• Creating encrypted folders
[ 25 ]
Starting with Kali Linux
Resetting the root password
To change a user password, use the following command:
passwd root
You will then be prompted to enter a new password, as shown in the
following screenshot:
Adding a non-root user
Many of the applications provided in Kali must run with root-level privileges
in order to function. Root-level privileges do possess a certain amount of risk,
for example, miskeying a command or using the wrong command can cause
applications to fail or even damage the system being tested. In some cases, it is
preferable to test with user-level privileges. In fact, some applications force the use
of lower-privilege accounts.
To create a non-root user, you can simply use the command adduser from the terminal
and follow the instructions that appear, as shown in the following screenshot:
Speeding up Kali operations
Several tools can be used to optimize and speed up Kali operations:
• When using a virtual machine, install the VM's software drive
package: Guest Additions (VirtualBox) or VMware Tools (VMware).
[ 26 ]
Chapter 1
• When creating a virtual machine, select a fixed disk size instead of one that is
dynamically allocated. It is faster to add files to a fixed disk, and there is less
file fragmentation.
• The preload application (apt-get install preload) identifies a user's
most commonly used programs and preloads binaries and dependencies into
memory to provide faster access. It works automatically after the first restart
following installation.
• BleachBit (apt-get install bleachbit) frees disk space and improves
privacy by freeing the cache, deleting cookies, clearing Internet history,
shredding temporary files, deleting logs, and discarding other unnecessary
files. Advanced features include shredding files to prevent recovery and
wiping free disk space to hide traces of files that have not been fully deleted.
• By default, Kali does not show all applications that are present in the start-up
menu. Each application that is installed during the boot-up process slows the
system data, and may impact memory use and system performance. Install
Boot Up Manager (BUM) to disable unnecessary services and applications
that are enabled during the boot up (apt-get install bum), as shown in
the following screenshot:
[ 27 ]
Starting with Kali Linux
• Add gnome-do (apt-get install gnome-do) to launch applications
directly from the keyboard. To configure gnome-do, select it from the
Applications | Accessories menu. Once launched, select the Preferences
menu, activate the Quiet Launch function, and select a launch command
(for example, Ctrl + Shift). Clear any existing commands, and then enter
the command line to be executed when the launch keys are selected.
Rather than launching directly from the keyboard, it is possible to write
specific scripts that launch complex operations.
Sharing folders with Microsoft Windows
The Kali toolset has the flexibility to share results with applications residing on
different operating systems, especially Microsoft Windows. The most effective way
to share data is to create a folder that is accessible from the host operating system
as well as the Kali Linux VM guest.
When data is placed in a shared folder from either the host or the VM, it is
immediately available via the shared folder to all systems that access that
shared folder.
To create a shared folder, perform the following steps:
1. Create a folder on the host operating system. In this example, it will be
called Kali_Share.
2. Right-click on the folder and select the Sharing tab. From this menu,
select Share.
3. Ensure that the file is shared with Everyone, and that Permission Level for
this share is set to Read / Write.
4. If you have not already done so, install the appropriate tools onto BackTrack.
For example, when using VMware, install the VMware tools (refer to Appendix,
Installing Kali Linux).
5. When the installation is complete, go to the VMware menu and select Virtual
Machine Setting. Find the menu that enables Shared Folders and select
Always Enabled. Create a path to the shared folder that is present on the
host operating system, as shown in the following screenshot:
[ 28 ]
Chapter 1
Although VirtualBox uses different menu titles,
the process is the same.
6. Open the file browser on the Kali desktop. The shared folder will be visible
in the mnt folder (it might be placed in a sub-folder, hgfs).
7. Drag the folder onto the Kali desktop to create a link to the real folder.
8. Everything placed in the folder will be accessible in the folder of the same
name on the host operating system, and vice versa.
The shared folder, which will contain sensitive data from a penetration test, must be
encrypted to protect the client's network and reduce the tester's liability should the
data ever be lost or stolen.
[ 29 ]
Starting with Kali Linux
Creating an encrypted folder with TrueCrypt
During a penetration test, you will have access to sensitive client information,
including exploitable vulnerabilities and copies of successfully breached data.
It is the tester's legal and moral responsibility to ensure that this information in
his care is secured at all times. The best means of meeting this responsibility is to
ensure that all client information is encrypted during storage and transmission.
To install TrueCrypt on BackTrack, complete the following steps:
1. In the Applications menu, select Accessories | TrueCrypt.
2. To create an encrypted folder, open the application. You will be presented
with the main menu, as shown in the following screenshot:
[ 30 ]
Chapter 1
3. On the main menu, select the Create Volume button. This will launch the
TrueCrypt Volume Creation Wizard, as shown in the following screenshot:
4. Select Create an encrypted file container, and then click on Next.
5. The next screen will prompt for Volume Type, select Standard TrueCrypt
volume, and click on Next.
6. On the Volume Location screen, select Select File. You will be asked to
Specify a New TrueCrypt Volume by providing a Name, and indicating that
it will save in the folder specified, as shown in the following screenshot:
[ 31 ]
Starting with Kali Linux
7. Chose a filename. Do not choose a filename related to the client being tested,
or which indicates that sensitive material is present in the directory. Use a
number or code word to represent the client, and a generic title for results.
Save the file on the desktop, then click on Next.
8. The next screen will provide you with Encryption Options. Select
Encryption Algorithm from the drop-down menu. There are several
choices, but for regular purposes, AES (the default 256-bit key) will suffice.
You will also select a Hash Algorithm from the drop-down menu (the
default, RIPEMD-160, should be sufficient). After your choices are complete,
click on the Next button, as shown in the following screenshot:
9. You will now be prompted for Volume Size. You should have a minimum
size of approximately 500 MB, but this may vary depending on the testing
regime. Click on Next.
[ 32 ]
Chapter 1
10. The Volume Password should be selected according to the rules provided
for strong passwords. Select and confirm the password, then click on Next,
as shown in the following screenshot:
11. The next screen allows you to select Format Options. For Filesystem
Options select FAT from the drop-down menu. Click on Next.
12. The next screen, Volume Format, creates a random key for the encrypted
filesystem. The key is based on mouse movements, and you will be
prompted to move the mouse over the window for a long period to ensure
the randomness (cryptographic strength) of the encryption keys. When done,
click on Format to create the TrueCrypt volume.
13. The final volume has been created. It will appear as an icon on the desktop.
The volume is encrypted, and it can be copied to an external storage device
or moved to the host system and remain encrypted.
[ 33 ]
Starting with Kali Linux
To use the encrypted volume, you must first choose a Slot to manage the encrypted
folder in the main TrueCrypt menu. When this is done, use the Select File button
to select the name of the encrypted file. In this case, we'll use a previously made file
called pentest located on the desktop, as shown in the following screenshot:
Click on the Mount button. At this point, you will be prompted for the password, as
shown in the following screenshot:
When the correct password is entered, you will see the Slot 1 details change to
reflect the encrypted folder's properties, and a new icon called truerypt1 will
be displayed on the desktop, will be displayed on the desktop, as shown in the
following screenshot:
[ 34 ]
Chapter 1
If you double-click on the truecrypt1 icon, you will be taken to a File Browser view.
At this point, it will act as a regular directory, and you can use the folder to store
all of the test-related information. When you work with the contents of the folder,
and wish to ensure that all data is encrypted, select Dismount on the main menu.
The folder will revert to an encrypted state.
Managing third-party applications
Although Kali comes preloaded with several hundred applications, it is
likely that you will need to install additional applications to effectively test specific
environments (such as industrial systems), add new cutting edge tools, or ensure
that your favorite tools are installed. Kali makes it easy to locate, install, and
manage these tools.
Installing third-party applications
There are multiple ways to install third party applications: using the apt-get
command, accessing a GitHub repository, and directly installing the application.
All tools should be installed from the Kali Linux repository using the apt-get
install command. The install command can be executed from the command line
in a terminal window, or the user may select a graphical package management tool.
[ 35 ]
Starting with Kali Linux
Recommended third-party applications include:
• apt-file: This is a command-line tool to search within packages of the
APT packaging system. It allows you to list contents of a package without
installing or fetching it.
• gnome-tweak-tool: This allows users to change themes and rapidly
configure desktop options.
• instanbul: This is a desktop screen recorder that allows you to make a
movie of desktop activities.
• openoffice: This is an open source office productivity suite that assists
in documentation.
• scrub: This is a secure deletion (anti-forensic) tool that securely deletes
data to comply with stringent government standards using various
overwrite patterns.
• shutter: This is a screenshot tool that captures images of a desktop,
open window, or a selection.
• team viewer: This supports remote access and remote administration.
It also allows testers to place a pre-configured computer (a dropbox) on the
target network and control testing from a remote location.
• terminator: This is a replacement for the Linux terminal window that
allows horizontal scrolling—no more wrapped text!
Tools that are not present in a Debian repository and are accessible using apt-get
install can still be installed on Kali. However, the user must accept that manual
installs are not coordinated with repositories, and they may break dependencies
causing applications to fail.
Some tools use the GitHub online repository for software development projects.
Many developers favor this open repository due to the flexibility of the Git revision
system as well as the social-media aspects of the software sites. One tool that we will
be using is recon-ng, a web reconnaissance framework.
To clone the current version of recon-ng from the GitHub repository, use the
following command line:
cd /opt; git clone
https://PI:EMAIL/LaNMaSteR53/recon-ng.git
cd opt/recon-ng
./recon-ng.py
[ 36 ]
Chapter 1
Finally, some applications must be manually installed. For example, to restore the
asynchronous port scanner Unicornscan, can back to Kali, you must:
• Ensure the dependencies are first present: apt-get install flex
• Download the latest version of Unicornscan (www.unicornscan.org – the
current version is unicornscan-0.4.7-2)
• Extract the contents of the file to a new directory: tar jxf
unicornscan-0.4.7-2.tar.bz2
• Change to the directory containing Unicornscan: cd unicornscan-0.4.7/
• Compile the source code: ./configure CFLAGS=-D_GNU_SOURCE && make
&& make install
The exact dependencies and make install process will vary for each application, so
you will need to refer to the developer's README file to ensure correct installation and
configuration of these applications.
Running third-party applications with
non-root privileges
Kali Linux is intended to support penetration testing. Most of the tools require
root-level access, which is why access to the toolset and data is protected with
passwords and encryption.
However, some third-party tools are not meant to run with root-level privileges.
Tools such as web browsers may be compromised, and giving an attacker access to
root privileges can have a significant security impact.
If root access is not required, tools should follow the principle of least privilege and
run as non-root users.
To run an application that normally runs as a non-root user, log on to Kali using a
root account. Kali should be configured with a non-root account. In this example,
we will use the noroot account previously created with the adduser command.
Perform the following steps to run the web browser Iceweasel as non-root:
1. Create a non-root user account. In this example, we will use noroot.
2. We will use sux, which is a wrapper application that transfers credentials
from a privileged user to a target non-root user. Download and install sux
using the apt-get install command.
[ 37 ]
Starting with Kali Linux
3. Start the web browser, and then minimize it.
4. Enter the command line: ps aux |grep iceweasel. As you can see,
Iceweasel is running with root privileges.
5. Close Iceweasel, and relaunch using the command sux - noroot
iceweasel, as shown in the following screenshot:
If you examine the Iceweasel title bar, shown in the following screenshot, you will
see that it was invoked as the user noroot, an account that did not have
administrator privileges.
You can also confirm that Iceweasel is running under the noroot account by
examining the open processes, as shown in the following screenshot:
Effective management of penetration tests
One of the most difficult aspects of penetration testing is remembering to test all of
the relevant parts of the network or system target, or trying to remember if the target
was actually tested, after the testing has been completed.
[ 38 ]
Chapter 1
BT 5r3 emphasized the use of management tools such as Draedis and MagicTree.
These tools facilitate group testing by providing a central repository for test data.
In addition, they usually provide some framework so that testers know where they
are within a testing methodology, and what tests remain to be completed. Tools of
this nature are excellent in coordinating defined group activities during
a vulnerability assessment or penetration test.
These tools remain in the Applications | Kali Linux | Reporting Tools | Evidence
Management menu.
But what about complex penetration tests where the methodology may be more fluid
as it adapts to the network target?
Some testers use keyloggers or Wireshark during testing to record keystrokes and
packet traffic generated during the test. This data can be especially useful if the
testing is causing a network or application outage, because replaying and analyzing
the packets sent can identify which packet tools impacted the network.
Kali Linux includes several tools that are more suited to making rapid notes and
serving as a repository of rapidly added cut-and-paste data, including KeepNote
and the Zim desktop wiki.
Testers not only need to perform tests and collect data, they also need to be able
to provide their findings to the client. This can be difficult, as some results are
transient—a test demonstrates a finding at one point in time, and then something is
changed on the target system, and future testing fails to demonstrate the exploitable
vulnerability, even though it's possible for it to re-emerge.
The other challenge with positive results is that they need to be demonstrated to a
client in a way that's understandable.
The golden rule is to always grab a screenshot of any positive, or potential, finding.
Use a tool such as Shutter to capture images from the desktop.
By default, Kali is configured with CutyCapt, which is a cross-platform command-
line utility that captures a web page and creates a variety of image types, including
PDF, PS, PNG, JPEG, TIFF, GIF, and BMP.
