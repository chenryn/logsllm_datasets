Furthermore, Cihan succeeded in recovering recognizable charac-
ters from a laser printer using the EM emanations at a distance of 1
meter in 2016 [49]. In the case of keyboards, which are widely used
as an input device of password, related works have been conducted
since the early 1990s. In the early 2000s, research mainly focused
on keyboard sounds [6, 57]. In 2009, Vuagnoux eventually obtained
a significant result of 95% restoration at 20 meters by using the
leaked EM waves from a PS/2 keyboard [51]. In the early 2010s,
more advanced research on the radiated EM waves of keyboard
keystrokes was actively conducted [10, 52].
From the perspective of national intelligence, less unintended
EM leakages made eavesdropping strategy evolve from the all-
passive (e.g., TEMPEST) to a semi-active approach. In 2013, Edward
Snowden revealed a secret document (i.e., NSA Advanced Network
Technology catalog [53]) in 2008. The document dealt with surveil-
lance technologies implemented by NSA. This document showed
that NSA recently developed the RF retroreflector attack (RFRA)
to obtain information in a semi-active way. RAGEMASTER is an
example of RFRA; it involves the insertion of an RF retroreflector
into a video graphics array (VGA) cable. If a strong carrier signal is
emitted, the video signal is modulated and re-radiated on the video
cable. The dedicated receiver can restore the screen of the target
monitor by demodulating the re-radiated signal.

2.2 Carrier Coupling and Strong Coupling
Conditions
As it has long been well known in the field of RF research area [2, 28,
30, 50], one or more carriers in a single circuit are radiated with the
forms of “carrier coupling” and “carrier intermodulation & coupling,”
respectively. These EM radiation and coupling mechanisms are
illustrated in Appendix A in detail [3, 26, 31, 35].
However, the “carrier intermodulation & coupling” radiations
have to meet the following conditions for strong outward emissions.
• Condition 1. Three signal sources (two carriers and one base-
band signal) should be in such a situation where they can be
easily coupled in a radiative or conductive manner.
• Condition 2. Two carrier sources should have enough power
to be radiated over a long distance.
2.3 Coupling Circumstance in Recent MSoCs
Figure 3 shows the latest trends in recent electronic devices. The ini-
tial devices (Tier 1 in Figure 3) were developed with a combination
of separate chipsets that are individually in charge of digital (in-
cluding CPUs), analog (including audio input/output circuits), and
power (including voltage regulators) functions. As the demand for
miniaturization increases, Tier 2 MSoCs, which integrate digital and
analog chips into a single chipset, have emerged. Furthermore, Tier
3 MSoCs, in which digital, analog, and power circuits are integrated
into a single chipset, have recently been released in response to
the further demands of IoT sensor nodes for super-miniaturization.
However, the highly integrated MSoC architecture brings about the
unexpected noise-coupling problem. According to [17], reducing
the coupling noise of MSoC that is caused by the common substrate
is still a significant challenge because the coupling noise becomes
stronger as the size gets smaller. Figure 4 shows a cutting view of a
tier 3 MSoC die having two carriers (i.e., an external system clock
and an internal SWREG noise) and one analog input or output. In
MSoC common substrate, the strong conductive coupling among
the three sources is unavoidable. In other words, the coupling cur-
rents (𝐼𝑐1, 𝐼𝑐2, and 𝐼𝐴) within the Tier 3 device are much larger than
those within the Tier 1 or Tier 2 device in which two carrier sources
may be located in the separated chipsets.
(a) Time
(b) Frequency
Figure 6: SWREG output characteristics.
As a result, it can be said that brand-new MSoCs may meet “the
strong coupling condition 1”, as listed in Subsection 2.2.
As illustrated before, the two carrier sources that we are paying
attention are the system clock and the SWREG noise. The system
clock is an indispensable input signal of the electronic devices.
The clock source is a square wave and consists of a fundamental
frequency (𝑓𝑆 𝑦𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑚_𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘) and several odd harmonics as shown in
Figure 5. These frequency components of the system clock are strongly
coupled to all around the components of the substrate because the clock
is used in all the synchronous circuits of the CPUs and peripherals [8].
Figure 6 shows the basic operating mechanism of SWREG for
generating an internal supply voltage. The externally supplied
high-level voltage is lowered, while the status of a switch element
is changed between ON and OFF with the switching frequency
(𝑓𝑆𝑊 𝑅𝐸𝐺_𝑛𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒). In this figure, the frequency spectrum of the output
voltage consists of the fundamental component of 𝑓𝑆𝑊 𝑅𝐸𝐺_𝑛𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒
and its harmonics. These SWREG noises are also strongly coupled to
the substrate via numerous contacts around all the semiconductor die
[2]. On the other hand, a linear regulator, known as the low dropout
(LDO) regulator, is free of the switching noise because it dissipates
the voltage difference via heat. Nevertheless, the use of SWREG is
increasing because of its power efficiency. Thus, considering the
fatal battery life problem of mobile devices, it may be difficult to
avoid the strong switching noise even in the future.
Considering the unintentional EM radiation, the two carrier
sources may meet the aforementioned second coupling condition.
Thus, it is very important to recognize the fact that the system clock
and the SWREG noise are widespread over the common substrate.
The common strong carrier in the “Screaming Channel [9]” and
this paper is the system clock. However, as another strong source,
this paper utilizes the newly introduced SWREG noise, whereas
reference [9] exploited the RF carrier for wireless digital communi-
cation. This small difference makes two studies significantly distinct
with respect to the attack practicability. In other words, the unique
frequency distribution features of SWREG noise, such as dense,
wideband, and static, make the new TEMPEST attack due to the
SWREG noise become considerably practical.
Session 4B: Physical Attacks CCS '20, November 9–13, 2020, Virtual Event, USA1088Actually, there exist three strong carriers, (a) the system clock,
(b) the SWREG noise, and (c) the RF carrier, in RF integrated MSoC.
The coupling chracteristics among three carriers are not clearly
investigated and further studies are needed.
3 THREAT MODEL AND FEASIBILITY
ANALYSIS
3.1 Threat Model
The adversary’s goal is to eavesdrop audio information which is
processed in a tiny audio IoT device without an owner’s awareness.
We assume that adversaries own only a small-sized receiver system,
need not any direct access to the target device, and may be located
in an invisible place.
Target Devices. We assume that an adversary may target at IoT
devices that adopt an all-in-one Tier 3 MSoC. Note that the latest
trends in recent devices for IoT are the rapid change toward the
Tier 3 MSoCs.
Target Media. Since a partial or distorted audio signal can con-
vey intelligible information, we assume that an adversary tries to
eavesdrop only audio information.
No Target Device Access. An adversary doesn’t need any direct
access to the target devices. She needs not physically touch them,
alter the device settings, or install a malware. However, she is fully
aware of the characteristics of the target devices in advance. Such
knowledge can be obtained by first acquiring the device model
and then analyzing the device of the same model before launching
attacks.
Invisible Target Environment. Compared to audio sound in
an atmosphere environment, carrier-modulated audio signals show
lower attenuation according to distance and better obstacle pen-
etrability. Therefore, an adversary’s antenna may not be located
in the vicinity of the target devices. Furthermore, when the attack
devices are operated in a closed room, she may successfully attack
outside of the room.
Interference-Robustness. In a practical environment, there are
many commercially licensed frequency signals and various spu-
rious signals on the adversary’s interesting frequency. When the
interferences conflict with the target signal, she can easily over-
come the problematic situation by changing the center frequency
into one of the numerous alternatives; the frequency selectivity is
caused due to the dense and wideband emanation characteristics.
Real-time. We assume that an adversary eavesdrops a victim’s
audio information in real-time with an acceptable delay (i.e., an RF
propagation delay and a demodulation processing time). Note that
she needs not try to extract any encryption key because her goal is
to directly capture and demodulate only carrier-modulated red (i.e.,
plain) audio signals.
Portable Attack Equipment. The attacking equipment could
be composed of readily available commercial devices and antennas.
Also, if an adversary employs a recently popular software-defined
radio (SDR) receiver, she may pack a full attack set in a briefcase
and easily carry it. As a result, she may attack while walking around
a victim.

each type of regulator (top: LDO and bottom: SWREG).
3.2 Target MSoC: nRF52840
To verify the illustrated generation mechanism and the features of
the new SWREG noise-based EM radiations, we select the Nordic
Semiconductor’s “nRF52840 [36]” as the experimental target chipset
due to the following reasons. First, the Nordic Semiconductor is
one of the leading companies in the field of Bluetooth low energy
(BLE) MSoCs. Second, this chipset is the most recently released Tier
3 MSoC that integrates all the components (such as CPU, RF, power,
ADC, GPIO, and encryption engine). Third, it has two integrated
cascaded SWREGs that can be controlled by modifying its firmware.
The “nRF52840 Dongle [37]” was also selected as the target device.
As shown in Figure 7, the dongle has the PCB antenna, the external
clock source (32 MHz), the ADC interfaces, and the USB interface
for supplying power.
3.3 Experimental Setup
Because the strength of the emitted signal originated from MSoC
is relatively weak, we carefully configure the receiver structure,
as shown in Appendix B. The high directivity wideband antenna
and the low noise amplifier (LNA) make it possible to detect a
weak signal. The SDR down-converts and digitizes the signal at
the specified frequency. Finally, the laptop acquires, analyzes, and
demodulates the digitized signal by using the GNU Radio [14]. In
the experiments, the following two sources are employed as an
ADC input: (a) “the microphone” (Electret Microphone breakout
[1]) to model an actual audio input and (b) “the function generator”
(Keysight 81160A [19]) to inject a controllable signal with respect
to a signal type, power, frequency, or impedance.
Additionally, the Bluetooth radio components are turned off to
make sure that there is no “screaming channel [9]” radiation. And
the measurement is performed in an anechoic chamber for avoiding
signal interference from commercially licensed frequency band.

3.4 Experimental Results & Discussion
3.4.1 Measurement of the SWREG Noise. We measure the noise
characteristics of the power regulators (SWREG and LDO) in the
target chipset. Figure 8 shows the measured frequency spectra of
the VDD_OUT output pin when LDO and SWREG are configured,
respectively. Compared to LDO, the output voltage of SWREG has
strong unwanted frequency components at the fundamental 2 MHz
frequency and its harmonics; among them, its fourth harmonic
component at 8 MHz has the strongest power. The power difference
between two regulators is as large as about 20 dB at 8 MHz.
However, Table 1 shows the current consumption when LDO
and SWREG are configured, respectively. The result demonstrates
that SWREG is much more efficient than LDO. If the device is
configured to LDO, the battery life of the device will be shortened
by approximately 47 %, compared to SWREG. These results verify
that there is the critical trade-off situation between the switching
noise and the power consumption, as described in Subsection 2.3.
Search for Suspected Leakages. We search the carrier modu-
3.4.2
lated radiations when an analog audio signal is originally entered
into the ADC port of the target device when SWREG is configured.
As the input source of ADC, the microphone breakout [1] whose
peak-to-peak voltage (𝑉𝑝𝑝) value is 2 Volts (the allowable ADC
input range of the chipset is 3.3 𝑉𝑝𝑝) is connected. The distance
between the antenna and the target device is 15 centimeters. While
we search for the emission components over the wideband (from
several MHz to 1 GHz), we repetitively play the frequency sweep
tone sound into the microphone whose frequency range is from
DC to 20 kHz and the period is one second. Figure 9(a) shows the
measured Fosphor [13] diagram at 192 MHz that displays a live,
fade-out, and max-hold spectrum and a spectrogram, simultane-
ously. In the Fosphor diagram, we define the unintentional signal
to noise ratio (USNR) as the ratio of the unintentional signal power
to the background noise power. The unintentional spectral power
is relatively strong in the near-distance experiment and 18 dB of
USNR margin in this figure shows the possibility of the TEMPEST
attack on the target MSoC from a distance.
Frequency Distribution of Leaked Signals. We measure the
3.4.3
distribution of all the unintentional signal emissions over wide-
frequency bands (from several MHz to 1 GHz), depending on whether
SWREG is used or not. The function generator is connected to
the ADC port as the input source and generates the same sweep
tone signal within the maximum allowable dynamic range, 3.3 𝑉𝑝𝑝,
guaranteeing the 100 Ω constant impedance at a distance of 15
centimeters between the antenna and the target device.
Figure 9(b) shows the measured noise and unintentional signal
power distributions, in relation to the regulator type. The black line
in this figure shows the measured noise power at the respective
frequencies (i.e., multiples of 2 MHz). The red line shows the power
distribution where LDO is selected. From the red line in this figure,
as was expected, significant power peaks are apparent almost at
intervals of 32 MHz (i.e., the externally supplied clock frequency)
or 64 MHz (i.e., the CPU clock frequency). This red line is similar to
Figure 17(b) in Appendix A. The blue line in this figure also shows
the power distribution when SWREG is configured instead of LDO.
We can observe that the overall signal powers are considerably
increased, and there are significant peaks at intervals of 8 MHz (i.e.,
the strongest harmonic of the SWREG noise) and small peaks at
intervals of 2 MHz (i.e., its fundamental frequency). Particularly, the
spectral envelope of the blue line that has higher peaks at intervals
of 64 MHz (i.e., the CPU clock frequency) shows the evidence of
the internal inter-modulation and substrate coupling within MSoC.
The blue line in this figure is similar to Figure 18 in Appendix A.
The comparison result indicates that the SWREG noise substantially
increases the unwanted radiations. Also, From Figure 9(b), we can
verify the aforementioned unique features such as the dense, wideband,
and static frequency distribution.
