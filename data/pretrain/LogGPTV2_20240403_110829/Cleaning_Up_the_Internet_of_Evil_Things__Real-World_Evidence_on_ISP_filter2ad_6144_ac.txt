### B. Impact of Notification Content

To investigate whether the improved notification content had a significant impact, we compared the remediation rates of the walled garden group in the experiment to those in the observational study. The customers in the observational study did not receive any notifications.

**Figure 4: Diagram of the Randomized Controlled Experiment**

It is possible for an infected device to go undetected for a few days in the Shadowserver, IoTPOT, and darknet data. This can be due to various reasons, including temporary network disruptions, the behavior of the malware, or the infected device itself. (These limitations are discussed in Section IX.)

Without additional safeguards, missing observations during the 14-day tracking period could lead to an overestimation of the remediation rate. To address this, we implemented a safeguard. After the initial 14 days, we monitored the infection data sources for an additional 21 days to check for recurring observations of the customers in the experiment. If a customer was observed again during this period, we assumed they had not remediated within the 14-day period. For 34 (15%) of all customers, we collected one or more infection observations in the 21-day period, and thus set their status to "not remediated" (i.e., still infected) at the end of the 14 days.

Our conservative approach has a downside: within the 35-day period (14+21), we treat every observation in the Shadowserver, IoTPOT, and darknet data as evidence that the infection persists. In reality, some of these cases may be reinfections of devices that were clean for a short period, rather than continuously infected. Within this 35-day period, we cannot distinguish between infection and reinfection. To measure reinfection rates reliably, we turned to the customers from the observational study. We continuously monitored our data sources for the IP addresses associated with these customers for five months after the observational study period ended in October 2017. If any of these customers reappeared in the Shadowserver, IoTPOT, or darknet data between November 2017 and early April 2018, we counted these cases as reinfections.

### V. Results

We can now evaluate the effectiveness of the Mirai notifications. As shown in Figure 5, the total number of Mirai-infected customers was reduced from around 150 to fewer than 80 infected customers per day by the end of the experiment.

To further understand the impact of the experiment, we will compare the results for the different treatments (improved walled garden, standard walled garden, email, and control).

**Figure 5: Reduction in Mirai-Infected Customers Over Time**

Table III shows a slightly higher cleanup rate and a shorter median infection time for the improved walled garden treatment group compared to the standard walled garden treatment group. However, this difference does not pass the log-rank significance test (χ² = 1.7, p = 0.197). This suggests that either the effect is too small to be detected with our sample size, or there is no effect. It is also important to note that the studies were conducted at different times, which may have influenced the results. In any case, we cannot observe a clear impact of the more actionable walled garden content.

### C. Natural Remediation

As seen in Section V-A, the control group showed remarkably high remediation rates, even though they were not notified.

To confirm the presence of natural remediation in other networks, we randomly selected four other ISPs within the same country where our partner ISP operates and investigated the remediation rates during the period of the observational study. Although we do not control for potential causes of remediation, Figure 7 shows that all five ISPs experienced some degree of remediation in their networks, even though not all of them issued notifications regarding Mirai infections. This suggests a pervasive natural remediation process across different networks. We have explored potential explanations for this result.

We can rule out three sources of error:
1. **DHCP Churn:** Churn often affects measurements that use IP addresses as identifiers for hosts or users, complicating external tracking as devices might be assigned new IP addresses during the measurement period. Our results are immune to this problem because we knew the ISP’s customer ID for each user in the study. The ISP’s DHCP logs provided ground truth on the different IP addresses assigned to each customer ID over time.
2. **Additional Notifications:** If customers in the control group received other security notifications during the experiment, this might trigger remediation actions affecting the Mirai infection. Our design ensured that customers in the control group would not receive any other notifications during the 14-day period.
3. **Deterioration in Tracking Ability:** We speculated that cleaned devices might get reinfected with new Mirai variants or other IoT malware families that we could not observe in the darknet data using Mirai’s TCP sequence number artifact. While theoretically possible, we observed that overall Mirai infection levels remained constant in the darknet data, indicating that the Mirai variants causing the initial infections were still active. Additionally, none of the affected customers reappeared in the other two datasets: Shadowserver and IoTPOT.

One explanation for natural remediation is the non-persistent nature of Mirai infections. Every power cycle or unplugging action leads to cleanup. High natural cleanup might be driven by users who turn off devices or disconnect them, rather than using them continually. Many of these infections are very short-lived, with around 37% of the infections in the control group seen only once or twice and disappearing from the darknet data within one hour. These transient infections might reflect volatile usage patterns specific to certain IoT devices, such as a NAS device temporarily connected to another network, getting infected, and then being removed from the network.

### D. Natural Remediation in Other Networks

To investigate whether the high natural remediation rate in the control group was specific to this network or customer base, we analyzed the infection data for two other networks of the same ISP: their business services network and the network of a subsidiary brand offering consumer broadband. We compared the remediation rate of the control group from the experiment to the rates for the two other networks. Like our control group, the customers in the two other networks did not receive any notifications for IoT infections from the ISP, making them relevant points of reference.

As shown in Table III, the other networks also displayed high natural remediation rates. The rate in the business network (55%) was lower compared to the control group (74%) and the subsidiary (74%). Remediation in the two consumer groups (control and subsidiary) was virtually the same. Figure 6b also shows this pattern. The log-rank test reports a significant difference between customers with business service subscriptions and the control group (log-rank test, χ² = 5.4 with p-value = 0.0196) and between the business network and the subsidiary network (log-rank test, χ² = 4.9 with p-value = 0.0268).

The median infection time for the business network was significantly longer compared to the other networks. One hypothesis for this finding is that business customers, for continuity reasons, are less likely to reboot or power off their devices as often as consumers. This different usage pattern also suggests a different composition of IoT device types. As discussed in Section V-F, this is indeed the case. Taking these factors into account, we find very consistent natural remediation rates across the different networks, increasing our confidence in the results of the experiment.

### E. Long-Term Efficacy

The non-persistent nature of Mirai means that rebooting, shutting down, or unplugging an infected device would cause it to be removed. This fact seems to be an important driver of the high natural remediation rate observed during the experiment. However, merely rebooting the device does not fix the underlying vulnerability, and the device remains susceptible to reinfection once it comes back online. The high remediation rates observed in our experimental and observational studies might be Pyrrhic victories if the devices are simply reinfected soon thereafter. Removing the underlying problem would require affected users to take more complex actions, such as changing default passwords, updating firmware, or changing router settings.

To assess reinfection rates and the long-term efficacy of remediation efforts, we looked at the 97 customers in the observational study. We investigated reinfection rates for this group during a five-month period after the initial 35-day tracking period. We found that only 5 of these customers (5%) were seen again at some point during those five months in the Shadowserver, IoTPOT, or darknet data. In other words, not only is short-term remediation very high, but the longer-term efficacy is also promising.

### F. Impact of Device Type

So far, we have encountered several positive results: high remediation rates across all groups, even in the control group, and low reinfection rates in the months thereafter. To understand if these results are influenced by the composition of device types in these networks, we took a closer look at the affected devices.

Using a similar methodology as Antonakakis et al. [1], we used Censys [9] to determine the device types. We analyzed the banner information obtained through Censys scans and were able to label 88 devices (28%). These devices were mainly network cameras/DVRs (11%), storage units (7.44%), and routers (3.83%). However, the Censys scans did not allow us to label 72% of the infected devices due to the lack of banner information. To increase the number of identified devices, we conducted port scans on the unidentifiable devices using Network Mapper (Nmap). This active scanning gathered banner information from additional ports, such as port 5000 (UPnP), 8443 (alternative HTTPS), 32400 (Plex media), and 37777 (QSee DVRs), allowing us to label 36 additional devices.

**Table IV: Type of Infected Devices per Service**

| Device Type | Amount of Devices | Percentage |
|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| Network Cameras/DVRs | 20 | 7.81% |
| Storage Units | 13 | 5.08% |
| Routers | 3 | 1.17% |
| ... | ... | ... |

This detailed analysis helps us understand the composition of the affected devices and provides insights into the cleanup actions and usage patterns.
