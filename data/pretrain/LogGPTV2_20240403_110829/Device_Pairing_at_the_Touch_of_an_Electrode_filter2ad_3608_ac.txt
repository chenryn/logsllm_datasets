receiver electrodes are also decoupled from earth ground or any
other shared potential through a pair of Balun transformers. A
Balun transformer converts a single-ended signal (a signal ref-
erenced to a known potential) to a balanced signal and thereby
eliminates the effect of the shared potential by the grounded
measurement instruments. This is absolutely necessary and
simulates a realistic scenario for body channel communication,
as otherwise the shared ground potential will form a direct
return path, yielding an unrealistically strong signal. In a real
scenario the transmitter and receiver are not in direct contact
with each other and do not have a shared electric potential,
such as earth ground. This is especially true if transmitter and
receiver are implemented as battery-powered devices (e.g., in
mobile devices).
B. Electrode Design
The touch-electrodes, i.e., the electrodes that interface the
human body, we use are 4 cm by 4 cm sized aluminum
plates with a thickness of 1 mm (see Figure 6). If the touch-
electrodes are fabricated from a conductor, the effect of the
electrode material on intra-body communication is marginal,
see, e.g., [12]. In [4], aluminum and copper electrodes as well
as pre-gelled electrodes, such as commercial AgCl electrodes
used for electro-cardiogram measurements have been tested.
Pre-gelled electrodes can have better performance than copper
or aluminum plates for capacitive coupling as a body com-
munication method, since the gel enhances conductivity and
adherence to the skin. However, gelled electrodes are not an
option for our proposed device pairing mechanism for both
hygienic and usability reasons. We opted for aluminum plates,
as our touch-electrodes should be reusable and a permanent
feature of the device.
The ground electrodes of the transmitter and receiver
normally do not need to be implemented speciﬁcally. In an
actual device they would correspond to the ground plane
of the circuit board of the transmitter or receiver. For our
experiments, we implemented the ground electrodes as square
aluminum sheets similar to the touch-electrodes. They measure
7 cm by 7 cm and thus cover an area of 49 cm2 each. The

keying modulation. During the “on”-periods a frequency sweep is performed.
required surface area of the ground electrodes for reliable
body channel communication has been estimated in [9]. The
authors of [9] developed a distributed RC model to simulate
the characteristics of the human body channel when using
capacitive coupling in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 150
MHz. According to the authors’ empirical formula, 32 cm2
is sufﬁcient regardless of location of transmitter and receiver
on the body if a bit error rate of 10−6 can be tolerated. Our
ground electrodes cover 49 cm2 and we achieve similar error
rates (see Section VII-D).
C. Data Encoding and Modulation
We apply Manchester coding to the data before it
is
sent over the body channel. The encoded messages are then
transmitted using amplitude modulation in the form of on-off-
keying. When the bit of the encoding is high, the power on
the channel is “on” and similarly, if the bit of the encoding
is low the power is “off”. Our scheme differs from a simple
on-off-keying in the way that we do not use a single carrier or
center frequency for the “on”-period. Instead of transmitting
on a single frequency, the sender performs a sweep over a
range of frequencies (see Figure 7). The frequency sweep is
not dependent on the transmitted data. Whenever the power
is on the transmitter outputs a signal at a frequency of 0.5
MHz and keeps increasing the instantaneous frequency until
it reaches 3.5 MHz and the power is turned off. The purpose
of the frequency sweep is to characterize the communication
channel. If the sweep is present in the transmitted signal, the
receiver can measure the frequency-dependent attenuation over
a broad spectrum and verify that the measured characteristics
correspond to a human body channel.
D. Throughput and Error rate
With a duration of 1 milli-second per “on”-period, one data
bit takes 2 milli-seconds to transmit. Assuming that there are
no bit ﬂips, this results in a theoretical data rate of 500 bits
per second. For example, if the message authentication codes
RN and LN from the pairing protocol have 56 bit length, just
224 milliseconds are required to transmit both MACs over the
body channel.
In all our experiments, the measured bit error rate of the
body channel for hand-to-hand transmission was below 10−6.
This means that under normal operating conditions, i.e., when

the human body is not subjected to external interference, the
probability for a ﬂipped bit is very low. The transmission of
two 56 bit message authentication codes is errorless with a
probability of more than (1 − 10−6)2·56 = 99.98% if the bit
errors are equally likely to happen for every bit. Assuming
the MACs have 56 bit length, it is therefore not necessary to
compute error correcting codes and introduce redundancy into
the messages that are sent over the body channel.
E. Body Channel Characteristics
Some of the energy transmitted on the body channel is
lost due to the effect of the capacitive coupling and due to
the fact that the human body is not a perfect conductor. As
a consequence, the frequency sweeps that are sent by the
transmitter are attenuated. In fact, the attenuation is frequency
dependent, which means that not all parts of the frequency
sweep are affected to the same extent. Provided the transmitter
sends the sweeps at a ﬁxed power level, the receiver can exploit
this fact and measure the frequency dependent attenuation.
Since there are no active elements in the body channel, the
receiver essentially measures the S21 scattering parameter of
the transmission line through the human body.
By extracting this information from the messages received
through the touch-electrode, the receiver can characterize the
communication channel. If the receiver knows the attenuation
pattern that corresponds to a human body channel, it can
verify if the received frequency sweeps have traveled through
a human body by matching them with the known pattern.
In Figure 8, we show the channel characteristics for 7
different people when they are in physical contact with the
touch-electrode of transmitter and receiver. We plot the atten-
uation over the frequency range from 0.2 MHz to 10 MHz
and compare the body channel to the case where the touch-
electrodes are either shorted-out or not connected at all. It is

apparent that the human body channel exhibits characteristics
different from other conductors, such as a cable for instance.
If the touch electrodes are connected with each other through
a copper wire, the attenuation is low throughout the entire
frequency spectrum. Contrary to that, if the touch-electrodes
of the transmitter and receiver are not connected at all, i.e.,
they are ﬂoating, we see that all the frequencies are completely
attenuated and are not picked up by the receiver (bottom line
in Figure 8). In that case the frequency spectrum highlights
only noise and artifacts induced by the measurement setup.
As explained earlier in Section II, capacitive coupling
works in the frequency range of 1 MHz to 100 MHz. However,
frequencies higher than 10 MHz are mostly surface waves [35].
We focus on the frequencies between 0.5 MHz and 3.5 MHz to
extract the body channel characteristics. Figure 8 shows that
the higher the frequency, the lower the attenuation, because
more power is transmitted through the air. The signal does
not travel through or along the human body any more and
the channel characteristics become less unique to the human
body (i.e., the human body acts as a high-pass ﬁlter). We
capture the properties of the human body channel where they
are most speciﬁc and can facilitate the distinction whether the
characteristics belong to human body channel or not.
F. Experiment Dataset and User Safety
For the experimental analysis of our proposed pairing
scheme, we collected data from a total of 15 study participants.
The study was approved by the ethics board of the University
of Oxford under the reference number R53956/001. The partic-
ipant group of the study consisted of two women and 13 men
who were between 22 to 45 years old. Figure 9 shows the body
dimensions of the study participants. We collected more than
50 data transmissions per participant and conducted additional
experiments to prove that our protocol is secure.
Our implementation of body communication is safe to use
and does not pose a risk to human health. The return path
for capacitive coupling goes through the air, which results
in very high resistance and little current ﬂow [34]. In fact,
the current through the body never exceeded 12 micro-ampere
(see Table I). This is much weaker than what commercially
available body composition measurement devices emit. Body
fat monitors, for instance, pass a current of up to 500 micro-
amperes through a person [23].

that
the exposure to the electromagnetic ﬁeld created by
the capacitive coupling does not jeopardize human health.
We consulted the “Guidelines for limiting exposure to time-
varying electric, magnetic, and electromagnetic ﬁelds” issued
by ICNIRP (see [1], [14]) and concluded that the electric ﬁeld
strength generated inside the human body stays well within
the suggested limit of 1.35V/m per 1000 Hz.
Moreover, we veriﬁed that the power of our body channel
transmitter does not violate FCC regulations [10]. We mea-
sured the strength of the radiated electromagnetic ﬁeld with
a rod antenna at a distance of 4 meters for a subset of our
participant group. The electromagnetic waves radiated into the
air did not exceed the limit of 30 µV/m in the entire frequency
range we experimented in, i.e., from 0.2 MHz to 10.0 MHz.
Lastly, we made sure that our lab instruments are isolated
from the touch-electrodes, such that even in the very unlikely
event of a hardware failure the participants are not exposed to
line voltage.
VIII. EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we present experiments that document the
properties of the body channel and validate the assumption
that the body channel is read-only for an attacker that is not
touching the body.
The read only property can be stated in two different ways
and we validate both experimentally.
• We verify that a body channel enabled device can
detect if a received message has been sent by another
device that is physically connected to the same person
or an outside signal source. The receiver should be
able to classify messages according to their origin; if
the message comes from a legitimate body channel or
an external transmitter.
• We examine if it is possible to “inject” a message
into the body channel in such a way that the physical
properties of the message appear at the receiver as if
the message was sent on the body channel.
We break the experiments down into these two statements
and report the results in the following.
A. Classiﬁcation of Body Channel Messages
Our proposed pairing protocol relies on the ability of
the body channel receiver to distinguish messages based on
their physical properties. This is important, not only from
a security standpoint, but also with respect to usability. The
device pairing protocol does not work if the receiver can not
detect the body channel. To show that a body channel receiver
can identify messages sent on body channel, we performed
data transmission through the body channel of 15 test subjects
under various conditions.
In order to capture data reﬂecting the intended use of the
device pairing protocol, we asked the participants to touch
receiver and transmitter electrodes as if they were paring two
devices. With the collected data we establish a baseline of the
attenuation pattern of the human body. We then analyze how
the channel characteristics change when the body channel is
modiﬁed, or if there is no human body present. We build and
train a classiﬁer that can exploit these differences and decide
whether a previously unseen message has been sent on the
body channel.
If the classiﬁer is universal enough to distinguish between
messages independently of the actual person involved in the
pairing, it can be readily deployed in any body channel enabled
device. Such a device would not require any user-speciﬁc input
or enrolment to classify messages and therefore could be taken
into operation without in-ﬁeld adjustments or calibration.
a) Feature Extraction: The receiver captures the mes-
sages that are transmitted on the body channel in the form
of the time varying voltage level at
the touch-electrode.
The measured electric signal is transformed to the frequency
domain where the channel characteristics become apparent.
We use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to compute the
frequency bins that correspond to the spectrum from 0.5 MHz
to 3.5 MHz. The magnitudes of each bin constitute the feature
values that are passed to the classiﬁer for training. As an
additional step, before we train the classiﬁer, we normalize
the extracted feature values to eliminate the effect the power
of the transmitter has on classiﬁcation.
b) Classiﬁer: We use support vector machines (SVMs)
to classify the channel characteristics and we treat the classiﬁ-
cation problem as supervised and binary. The classiﬁer has to
decide between two classes; the class of features that belong
to the body channel and the class of all unwanted interactions
with the body channel receiver (i.e., unwanted interactions are
combined to one class for training).
c) Evaluation: We evaluate the classiﬁer on samples
that we gathered in multiple scenarios that each fall into one of
those two classes. For the intended use of the body channel we
tested two different settings. The participant is either standing
or in a seated position when touching the electrodes.
The samples that represent unwanted interactions cover the
following scenarios:
1)
2)
3)
4)
5)
6)
No connection between the transmitter and receiver
electrodes. All electrodes are ﬂoating.
Transmitter and receiver electrodes are connected to
each other through a wire.
Transmitter and receiver electrodes are facing each
other at various distances (5 cm, 10 cm, 30 cm and
50 cm).
Transmitter is connected to either a rod antenna of
1 m length or a 25 cm by 80 cm aluminum sheet
(a large surface area improves capacitive coupling)
directly pointing at the receiver. This scenario repre-
sents an external transmitter communicating with the
body channel receiver.
One of the participant’s hand touches the electrode
of the receiver, but his other hand is not in physical
contact with the electrode of the transmitter. It hovers
over the transmitter electrode at various distances (5
cm, 10 cm and 30 cm).
The participant only touches the receiver electrode.
The transmitter is connected to a rod antenna or an
aluminum sheet which is placed at a distance of 30
