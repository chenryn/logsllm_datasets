given the following json code on editor (the pipeline `|` represents cursors
position)
    collections : {"profile": 'data.json', "users":[ |
    ]}
if I press `ctrl` \+ `delete` I would expect the code to look like this:
    collections : {"profile": 'data.json', "users":[ | ]}
_NOT_ like this
    collections : {"profile": 'data.json', "users":[ |
_Conclusion_
the shortcut should only delete the white space not any other characters IMO,
I may be wrong though and this may be down to preference, but I know most
editors have this behaviour.
