A Atomic Cognitive Operations and HP(C)
Calculation
There are four types of atomic cognitive operations com-
monly used in human-computer authentication systems.
Their deﬁnitions and performance models are introduced
in this section, which characterize the relation between ex-
periment parameters and reaction time (RT ) of an average
human. These performance models are utilized to evaluate
the cognitive workload for the existing LRPS systems, as
shown in Table 2.
A.1
(Single/Parallel) Recognition
Recognition is the process to correctly judge whether
a presented item have been encountered before. Recogni-
tion can be considered as a matching process of comparing
presented items with those stored in memory. The reac-
tion time of a recognition operation depends on the num-
ber of items which a subject memorizes. The item set in
the subject’s memory is referred to as a positive set. For
single item recognition, that is, only one item is shown to
the subject each time, one of the most well-known recog-
nition models [28] evaluates the reaction time as RT =
0.3964 + 0.0383 · k, where k is the size of the positive set.
When multiple items are present simultaneously, the sub-
ject is able to perform recognition in parallel. According to
the working memory capacity theory [12, 9, 30], the maxi-
mum number of parallel recognition channels is limited to
4 for an average subject. The reaction time of recogniz-
ing x items displayed simultaneously can be estimated as
RT = (0.3964 + 0.0383 · k) · ⌈x/4⌉.
Recognition is a common operation in LRPS, which is
used by the subject to judge whether an element appear-
ing in the challenge belongs to the positive set. The high-
complexity CAS scheme [31] is an example for single item
recognition, where the subject is asked to recognize an im-
age in the current position before deciding which image
will be recognized in the next move. The low-complexity
CAS scheme [31] and SecHCI [20] are examples of par-
allel recognition. In the low-complexity CAS scheme, the
subject needs to ﬁnd out the ﬁrst and the last secret image
appearing in a window consisting of 20 images; while in
SecHCI, the subject needs to identify all his secret images
among 30 candidate images.
A.2
(Free/Cued) Recall
Recall is the other principal method of memory retrieval
[3], which is deﬁned as reproducing the stimulus items.
Compared to recognition, the recall process is much slower
[10, 23]. The common interpretation of this is that recall is
associated with greater resource costs than recognition [10].
Recall might be carried out as a slow process of serial search
while recognition as a fast process of parallel retrieval [23].
Free recall and cued recall are two basic recall types. In
free recall, the subject is given a list of items to remember
and then is tested by recalling them in any order [25]. In
cued recall, the subject is given a list of items with cues to
remember, and cues are given in the test. Cues act as guides
to what the person is supposed to remember. For example,
given “a body of water”, the phrase is the cue for the word
“pond” [10]. Many psychological experiments have shown
that the reaction time of free recall increases exponential
as the size of positive set increases [25, 29]. In contrast,
the reaction time for cued recall is much shorter and only
increases linearly [10, 23].
Some LRPS systems require subjects to recall all his se-
cret items during the authentication. The LPN scheme [15]
and the APW scheme [2] are two examples, where the sub-
ject has to recall all the secret items and their corresponding
locations in order to read the challenge digit associated with

each secret item. These recall processes should be classiﬁed
as free recall as cues are not presented. However, no exper-
imental data have been provided in psychology literatures
for a large positive set consisted of 15 items required by
these schemes, while the common size for a positive set is
8 for free recall. Since it is difﬁcult to decide whether the
exponential trend still holds when the positive set is large,
we use the reaction time of cued recall as a conservative es-
timation for free recall used in those schemes. According to
the experimental results in [23, 7], the formula for the reac-
tion time of cued recall is RT = (0.3964+0.0383·φ·γ·k),
where φ is the ratio of cued recall compared to single item
recognition (φ = 1.969 in [23]), while γ is the additional
penalty if subjects are required to simultaneously recalling
the position of an item (γ = 1.317 in [7]).
A.3
(Single(cid:173)target/Multi(cid:173)target) Visual Search
Visual search is a perceptual task that involves an ac-
tive scan of the visual environment for particular targets
among other distractors. The measure of the involvement
of attention in visual search is often manifested as a slope
of the response time function over the number of items
displayed (referred to as window size) [33]. For single-
target visual search, searching a single target among a set
of items, its reaction time is believed to be linear as the
window size increases [34, 33] and can be estimated as
RT = 0.583 + 0.0529· w [34], where w is the window size.
For multi-target visual search, the reaction time is acceler-
ated instead of increasing linearly as the number of targets
increases in a ﬁxed-sized window [16].
Visual search is usually used in LRPS systems based on
simple challenges. PAS [4] and CHC [32] are examples
of using single-target visual search and multi-target visual
search, respectively. In PAS, the subject is asked to scan a
table cell containing 13 random letters to check whether a
secret letter is present or not. In CHC, the subject needs
to locate 3 secret elements in a window to form a trian-
gle. According to the results from [16], the reaction time of
3-targets visual search in CHC is approximately 1.8 times
longer than that of single-target visual search in the same
window.
A.4 Simple Cognitive Arithmetic
Simple cognitive arithmetic is a mental task to solve sim-
ple problems involving basic arithmetic operations (e.g.,
3 + 4, 7− 3, 3× 4, 12÷ 3). The simple arithmetic problems
can be further divided into three subsets, small, large and
zero-and-one problems [6]. For both addition and multipli-
cation, small problems are deﬁned as those with the product
of two operands smaller than or equal to 25, and large prob-
lems are deﬁned as those with the product of two operands
larger than 25. The small and large problems in subtrac-
tion and division are deﬁned on the basis of the inverse re-
lationships between addition and subtraction and between
multiplication and division. Zero-and-one problem is de-
ﬁned as involving 0 or 1 as an operand or answer. The com-
mon instances of zero-and-one problems include counting,
exclusive-or, and mod 2. As reported in the experiments of
[6], the average reaction time is 0.773 seconds for small ad-
dition, 0.959 seconds for small division, 0.924 seconds for
large addition, and 0.738 seconds for zero-and-one prob-
lems.
Simple cognitive arithmetic is usually used in LRPS
systems based on algebra problems. The counting-based
schemes [15, 20] are examples, where the subject is asked
to count the number of secret icons appearing in the chal-
lenge, and use the count value to calculate a response based
on a simple algebraic function.
B Strength of Multi-dimensional Counting
Assuming the user makes mistakes in the responses with
a ﬁxed error probability ρ, the average success rate of guess-
ing attack on the “correct” response for each authentica-
tion round is d, the number of candidate root secrets is
N, the adversary cannot distinguish the true secret only
when the equation
N−1 holds, which
means the decoys get the same count value as that of the
secret. Solving the equation gives ρ = 1 − d. Therefore,
the user should make the correct response with probability
1 − ρ = d. This implies that the user’s decision process is
similar to a random guessing, which defeats the purpose of
the authentication.
(1−ρ)(N d−1)+ρ·N d = 1
1−ρ
C Design Limitation of Counting-Based
LRPSes
In our simulation experiments, we discover that pair-
based statistical difference in Counting-based LRPSes ap-
pears when q is larger than 2, and increases with the value
of |r − w · k/n|, where r is the response value, w is the
window size, k is the number of secret elements, and n is
the total number of elements. This can be explained as fol-
lows: For a response, if the expected number of secret ele-
ments in a window is less than the expected number w· k/n
derived from the uniform distribution, the number of pairs
among secret elements is also less than the expected number
wk/n, and the number of pairs among decoy elements is
C 2
larger than the expected number derived from the uniform
distribution, and vice versa. The adversary is then able to
distinguish the secret elements from the other elements by
grouping the observations of different responses. Such at-
tack restricts a counting-based scheme from using a larger q
and thus reducing the number of rounds of an authentication
session without using a more complex response function.
