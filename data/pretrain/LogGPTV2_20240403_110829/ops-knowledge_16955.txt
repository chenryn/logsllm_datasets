User: I started programing a game on a Mac. Then, I brought the same EXACT code to another Mac. 
I got many, many different errors with Pygame saying it wasn't installed, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS! 
Anyway, I fixed those errors, then I went to go run the module and the window appeared then it crashed and gave me this message: 

IDLE's subprocess didn't make connection. Either IDLE can't start a
  subprocess or personal firewall software is blocking the connection

I never got this message before. However, it continues to crash. I have killed idle using the Activity Monitor. There weren't any files in the directory. I have deleted all of the Python files that I have created.
Trashed every .pyc file. The Mac I am using is on El Captain; Python is at 2.7.12. Like I said, the code has not changed AT ALL from the first computer.
However, games that are pre-installed with IDLE work perfectly. I have moved the program to the same folders as the games. I copied the content from my program to another file, still nothing.
All help is appreciated, thank you :)
Assistant: Okie Dokie I figured it out. You have to download the version of idle that is 2.7.(any) IMPORTANT!!! the version has to be 32 bit not 64 bit. Just search on the idle website idle 2.7.12 32 bit. Then download that. Finally download pygame 2.7.
Thanks everyone that helped out!
P.S. Some idle versions didn't work for me. However, 2.7.8 and 2.7.13 did
