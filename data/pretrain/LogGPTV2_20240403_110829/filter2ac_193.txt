**ATT&CK ID:** T1102.003  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** One-Way Communication

Adversaries may utilize legitimate, external web services as a means to send commands to compromised systems without receiving any return output over the same channel. In such scenarios, the compromised systems might leverage popular websites and social media platforms to host command and control (C2) instructions. These infected systems can then choose to transmit the output from these commands back through a different C2 channel, potentially using another distinct web service. Alternatively, in cases where adversaries do not require a response, the compromised systems may be configured to return no output at all.
