Address Usage Period & Address Turnaround Time (Days)

fastest turnaround to be one day, while the slowest was 611
days.
As we embedded multiple addresses in one page, we were
interested whether they were also simultaneously used for
the ﬁrst time. Therefore, we selected all RND addresses
which received more than one spam e-mail (78%) and group-
ed them by page requests. We denote the spread in turn-
around times as the range (max-min) of turnaround times
for the addresses embedded in one request. A low spread in-
dicates that all addresses in one request were ﬁrstly spammed
within the same period. The distribution of the spread in
hours is shown in Figure 4 (note the upper axis). 80% of the
pages show a spread of less than a day (99% for search en-
gines), and 27% of 0 seconds (94% for search engines) mean-
ing that all extracted addresses simultaneously received their
ﬁrst spam. This ﬁnding suggests that spam to our spamtrap
addresses was mainly sent in batches.
We also computed the amount of time that our addresses
receive spam, denoted here as the usage period. 11% (16%
for the search engines) of all addresses which received at
least two spam e-mails were used for less than a second,
17% (40%) for less than a day, and 78% (51%) for less than
a week. The longest observed usage of an e-mail address
was 1068 days (749 days). We mention that our monitoring
period spanned over 1202 days.
Comparing addresses advertised to search engine bots re-

control of Windows systems), four port 22 (remote control
of Unix systems), and ﬁve port 80 (HTTP).
Lastly, we study the geolocation of the observed IP ad-
dresses. By solely looking at the number of distinct IPs per
country (see Figure 3(a)), the bias in our data set towards
web sites in Germany is reﬂected in the geolocation of har-
vesting machines: 60.6% of all bot IPs are located in Ger-
many. Looking at AS information, we ﬁnd that the major-
ity of harvesting requests originate from AS3320 (Deutsche
Telekom residential access lines) in Germany.
However, are the German harvester bots also responsible
for most of the spam volume? By looking at the total spam
volume caused per harvesting location leads to a diﬀerent
distribution (see Figure 3(b)); harvester bots in Romania
and Bulgaria caused 72% of the received spam. All the 675
Bulgarian page requests were made by a single IP located
in a Bulgarian ISP in November 2010 (we observed 24 dis-
tinct IPs from Romania, as mentioned earlier). The German
bots that made up for 60% of all the distinct IPs were only
responsible for 10% of the spam.
4.2 E-Mail Address Usage
What happens to e-mail addresses after they were har-
vested? We investigated this aspect by focusing on the us-
age of harvested addresses. Concretely, we denote the time
between the address being harvested and their ﬁrst usage
as the turnaround time and show its distribution in Fig-
ure 4. 50% of the addresses received the ﬁrst spam e-mail
within four days after being harvested. The slowest observed
turnaround was 1068 days, whereas the fastest was 64 sec-
onds. Focusing the analysis only on addresses advertised to
search engines led to slower turnaround times (not shown
in the ﬁgure); 50% of the addresses were spammed within
11 days after a visit by a search engine bot. We found the
456veals various usage patterns; these addresses tend to be sent
more often in batches to addresses embedded within a page.
They also tend to have a slower turnaround time and a
longer usage period. We further mention that only 558 ad-
dresses advertised to search engines were spammed, making
this subset less representative than the whole data set.
4.3 Fingerprinting: User Agent Strings
In Figure 5 we show the usage of user agent strings sub-
mitted by harvesters bots in the HTTP header of the page
request to our web sites. Figure 5(a) shows the use of user
agents on a per-request basis. Note that the variability is
modulated by heavy-hitters as shown in Figure 2(b); thus a
per-IP classiﬁcation shifts the popularity of user agents.
Note the variation over time visible in Figure 5(a) and 5(b)
(also in Figure 6). One inference from this observation is the
existence of only a few parties that harvest addresses from
our sites. Depending on their activity, they can strongly
skew a given quarter’s statistics. Also, diﬀerences in Fig-
ure 5(a) and 5(b) suggest that the addresses harvested by
diﬀerent parties are not homogeneously used and caused dif-
ferent spam volumes.
We observed that 19% of the classiﬁed hosts as harvesters
submitted a user agent string mimicking those of major
search engines. By resolving IP addresses to AS numbers,
we ﬁnd that only 5% of the hosts using the Google bot
user agent do not originate from the Google AS and are
thus mimicking the Google bot. These 5% of the hosts are
located in various ISPs and hosting sites (including Ama-
zon EC2) located in seven diﬀerent countries. Checking the
whois records for each IP revealed various providers that
cannot be associated directly to Google. 95% are indeed
legitimate requests from the true Google AS. We did not
observe a case of faked user agents for Yahoo’s Slurp and
Microsoft’s Bing bots.
Seven years after the study of Prince [20], we ﬁnd the
Java user agent (e.g. “Java/1.6.0 17”), classiﬁed in our ﬁg-
ures as “Script” and reported by [20], still to be present.
Visits by this user agent span over the entire data set. We
ﬁnd this user agent to be used by 3% of the hosts classiﬁed
as harvester. However, these hosts account for 88% of the
page requests leading to spam, whereas spamtrap addresses
harvested by these hosts account for 55% of the total spam,
indicating that our data is skewed by one type of harvesting.
In particular, the majority of the hosts located in Romania
(cf. § 4.1) supplied the Java user agent string. These visits
caused 99.9% of the spam volume that can be traced back to
harvester bots in Romania. We found only a single host sub-
mitting six requests using “Mozilla/2.0 (compatible; NEWT
ActiveX; Win32)” as user agent. This ﬁnding indicates that
the usage of some harvesting software is fairly stable.
Out of curiosity, we personally replied to incoming spam in
a few cases. In one case, a personalised response was received
10 minutes after our inquiry, originating from a residential
access line located in the Netherlands. To our surprise, the
IP from which the e-mail was sent matched the IP to which
the address was issued a few days before (the harvester bot
did use the “Java” user agent). It is often speculated that
harvesting and mass e-mailing are two diﬀerent processes,
which might be conducted by diﬀerent entities. However,
this example shows the contrary, as the spammer did run the
harvesting bot on his/her computer or used the same bot as
proxy. This observation calls for further investigation.
4.4 Address Presentation Method Robustness
One aspect concerning webmasters is how to display e-
mail addresses on the web to prevent spam:
in a user-
friendly or an obfuscated way? To address this issue, we
