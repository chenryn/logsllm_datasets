User: How to use Ansible for automated configuration management? Please explain how Ansible works and common Playbook tasks.
Assistant: Ansible is an automated configuration management tool that can remotely manage and automatically configure a large number of servers through the SSH protocol. Compared with other automation tools, Ansible's biggest advantage is that it is easy to use and can quickly implement configuration management without requiring a lot of system management experience. How Ansible works: ① Install Ansible First, you need to install Ansible on the control node. Control nodes are hosts that execute Ansible commands. There are different installation methods, please refer to the official documentation for details: [Ansible official installation documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) ② Write the Host file Host file is used to store the Information such as the IP address, port, user name, password or key of the management host. ③ Create Playbook Playbook is the core part of Ansible and is a description file for automation tasks. It uses the YAML format to automate the configuration of multiple hosts by defining tasks and execution sequences. ④ Execute the Ansible command Use the ansible-playbook command to execute the Playbook file, and pass the task to the managed host for automatic configuration. Commonly used Playbook tasks in Ansible: ① File transfer tasks use the copy or template module to copy local files to remote servers or generate files based on templates. ② The software package management tasks use modules such as yum, apt or dpkg to automatically manage the software packages of the server, and realize the installation, upgrade and uninstallation of the software packages. ③ Service management tasks use systemd or service modules to manage services, such as starting, restarting, stopping, and reloading. ④ The configuration file management task uses the lineinfile or template module to modify or add the configuration file of the application. ⑤ User and group management tasks Use the user or group module to manage users and groups, such as creating, deleting, modifying, adding, etc. ⑥ System management tasks use modules such as cron or hostname or timezone to automatically configure the server's time, hostname, time zone, etc. ⑦ Database management tasks use modules such as mysql or postgresql to automatically install, start and configure database services. The above are commonly used Playbook tasks. Ansible also provides a large number of modules and plug-ins, and you can choose the appropriate module for configuration management according to your needs. Sample code and practical examples help users better understand and practice the use of Ansible.
