According to our deﬁnition, we will always see more hosts than lines with active hosts.
2 i. e., we observe only trafﬁc with TTL 63 and no HTTP activity.

Number of hosts per DSL line
Fig. 1. Fraction of DSL lines vs. number of hosts per line for SEP08 and AUG09a
However, the differences are strikingly large—up to 1.85 times as many hosts than lines
in MAR10 using the OS + browser version counting method. Independent of the esti-
mation method the number of hosts behind NAT devices, our host counts, are far larger
than the estimations by Beverly [3] from 2004, who estimated 1.09 times more hosts
than IPs. This difference might be due to 6 additional years of NAT gateway deploy-
ment, different vantage points (Internet peering/exchange point vs. broadband access),
different observation periods (1 h vs. 24 h), and/or information base (SYN trace vs. TTL
plus HTTP logs).
4.2 Number of Hosts Per Line
Given that we see so many more hosts than lines with active hosts, we next investigate
lower bounds for the number of lines with more than one host. A large fraction of such
lines implies many public IP addresses with more than one host, thus limiting the utility
of IPs as host identiﬁers. We see that 30–52 % of lines have more than one active host
(Table 4, rows E.1 and E.2). We note that between APR09 and AUG09a the number of
lines with more than one host increases signiﬁcantly (OS+ browser version, row E.2). We
attribute this to an increase in browser heterogeneity: Following the release of MSIE 8
in late March 2009, we observe a signiﬁcant share of MSIE 6, 7, and 8 in AUG09, while
only MSIE 6 and 7 have a signiﬁcant share in SEP08 and APR09. Consider the example
that two hosts use a DSL-line and both have WinXP and MSIE 7. In this case we cannot
distinguish between them. However, if one is upgraded to MSIE 8 while the other is not,
then we can distinguish them.
In Figure 1 we present a more detailed look by plotting the fraction of lines with n
hosts. We only present plots for SEP08 and AUG09a, the other traces exhibit similar
behavior. We focus on the bars labeled “all” ﬁrst. Note that we observe up to 7 % of
lines with more than 3 hosts. We also investigate whether this high number of lines
with multiple hosts is due to several computers (PCs or Macs) that are used via the
same line or whether mobile hand-held devices (e. g., iPhones), or game consoles (e. g.,
Wii) are responsible for this. We identify these devices by examining the HTTP user-
agent string. If we exclude mobile hand-held devices and game consoles, still 25–28 %
(OS only; 34–45 % with OS + browser version) of lines have more than one host (not
shown). Therefore, we conclude that the number of DSL lines with multiple end-hosts
is only slightly inﬂuenced by mobile devices. In [6], we investigated mobile device
usage in detail.

4.3 NAT Analysis with Different Data Set Types
As discussed in Section 3.4, we also use reduced data sets (“http”, “no TTL”, and “no
useragent”) and compare the NAT usage estimates to those based on the full data
set available to us (“all”). Figure 1 compares the number of hosts per line for the dif-
ferent data sets. Note, without HTTP user-agent data there is no difference between
the scheme for OS only and OS + browser version. Most accuracy is lost when rely-
ing on IP TTL only (“no useragent”). Removing the IP TTL (“no TTL”) information
shows slightly better results. Compared to “all” information using HTTP logs annotated
with TTL information (but discarding all non-HTTP activity, “http”) gives a very good
estimate of NAT prevalence.
5 Impact of Shorter Time-Scales
So far we have limited our discussion to a static view of NAT behavior, i. e., we analyzed
whether a DSL line is NATed and how many hosts are connected via this line. If a line
has more than one host, IP addresses cannot be reliably used as host identiﬁers when
considering time-scales of one day (our trace duration). However, it is possible that
even though a line has two hosts, the ﬁrst host is only active in the morning while the
second host is only active in the evening. Thus, although the line has two hosts, they are
not used at the same time. This can reduce the ambiguity of using IP addresses as host
identiﬁers over smaller time intervals (e. g., by utilizing timeouts).
5.1 Analysis Approach
To answer if multiple devices are used at the same time, we compute the minimal inter
activity time (mIAT) between any two HTTP requests issued by two different host on
the same DSL line. If we observe an mIAT of T seconds then we know that two or more
distinct hosts were active at this line within T seconds. As we need timestamps for this
analysis we cannot use the output of the ttlstats tool (Section 3.3) as it aggregates
all activity of a line for scalability reasons. Therefore, we revert to using HTTP request
logs, which corresponds to the “http” data type and use the OS only counting method.
These logs include timestamps for every request. We rely on Bro [9] for HTTP parsing.
5.2 Results
In Figure 2 we plot the fraction of lines with two or more hosts for increasing mIATs.
This plot enables us to study how close in time two (or more) hosts are active via the
same line. This allows us to estimate by how much ambiguity can be reduced by using
a timeout, i. e., by using the IP-to-host mapping only for a limited time.
Even with intervals as low as 1 sec we observe more than 10 % of DSL lines with
multiple hosts (12 % for MAR10). When considering mIATs of 1 h, around 20 % of
lines have activity from multiple hosts (18 % for SEP08 up to 22 % for MAR10). We
thus conclude that if a line has multiple hosts they are likely active at the same time
or within a short time period. We see the lines starting to level off at around 10 h. This

Minimal Inter Activity Time [s]
Fig. 2. Fraction of DSL lines with more than one active host within a particular time interval
using OS only
is likely due to the time interval that users actively use their computers, as opposed to
using them around the clock. We conﬁrm these results by applying the static analysis
(see Section 3.2 and Section 4.2) for slices of the traces, i. e., we subdivide each trace
into time bins of 1, 5, 10, 30, and 60 minutes and repeat the analysis for each bin.
6 Discussion
This study aims at estimating the number of active end-host per DSL line. Our method-
ology will likely underestimate the number of end hosts per lines, since we cannot dis-
tinguish between hosts with identical OS and browser software. This actually renders
our approach problematic for networks with homogeneous OS/software installations
(e. g., businesses). However, our approach already reveals a signiﬁcant number of hosts
per DSL line. Furthermore, the DSL lines in our data sets are for residential customers.
The ISP also offers different but comparable DSL plans for small businesses. Pars-
ing additional application protocol headers might reveal additional hosts that were not
counted, e. g., P2P peer IDs, however only a small fraction of DSL lines use P2P [5].
On the other hand there are factors that can bias our results towards overestimating
the number of hosts per DSL line: Our method counts a computer that has two OSes
installed (e. g., in a dual-boot or virtualized setup) as two different hosts. Yet, it is ques-
tionable if it is wrong to count them as separate hosts. Likewise, if a user updates his
browser during our observation period we also count the same machine twice. How-
ever, these artifacts decrease as we consider shorter time-frames since it requires time
to reboot another OS and/or update a browser. Therefore, the results for small mIATs
are reasonable lower bounds for the number of hosts per line.
We further note that some NAT gateway might not decrement the TTL. If such a NAT
gateway is used, we would classify the DSL as unNATed. However, if multiple hosts
are connected through such a gateway, we are able to detect them. We have not found
NAT Usage in Residential Broadband Networks

any evidence that a signiﬁcant number of such non-decrementing gateways is used by
our user population.
7 Conclusion
We presented a novel approach for detecting DSL lines that use network address trans-
lation (NAT) to connect to the Internet. Our approach is able to infer the presence of
a NAT device and to provide lower bounds for the number of hosts connected behind
the NAT gateway. For lines with multiple hosts connected we also studied the temporal
behavior to see whether multiple hosts are active at the same time. Our approach re-
lies on IP TTL information and HTTP user-agent strings and we analyze the accuracy
when using less information (e. g., TTLs only, or user-agent strings only) for the NAT
analysis. We ﬁnd that most accuracy is lost when user-agent strings are omitted.
We ﬁnd that 10 % of DSL lines have more than one host active at the same time and
that 20 % of lines have multiple hosts that are active within one hour of each other. Over-
all 30–52 % of lines have multiple hosts. These results underscore the perils involved
when using IPs as host identiﬁers.
In future work we plan to investigate NAT behavior over a number of consecutive
days and to augment our analysis with IPIDs and ephemeral ports. Combining IP ad-
dress churn [5] and NAT behavior, we further plan to assess the effect and potential
error of utilizing IPs as host identiﬁers.
