### According to Our Definition

According to our definition, we will always observe more hosts than lines with active hosts. Specifically, we only observe traffic with TTL 63 and no HTTP activity.

### Figure 1: Fraction of DSL Lines vs. Number of Hosts per Line for SEP08 and AUG09a

**Figure 1** shows the fraction of DSL lines versus the number of hosts per line for SEP08 and AUG09a. The figure includes various methods for counting hosts, such as using OS information only, OS and browser version, and different data sets (e.g., "http," "no TTL," "no user agent").

- **Trace SEP08:**
  - All - OS only
  - All - OS & Browser Version
  - HTTP - OS only
  - HTTP - OS & Browser Version
  - No TTL - OS only
  - No TTL - OS & Browser Version
  - No User Agent

- **Trace AUG09a:**
  - All - OS only
  - All - OS & Browser Version
  - HTTP - OS only
  - HTTP - OS & Browser Version
  - No TTL - OS only
  - No TTL - OS & Browser Version
  - No User Agent

The differences in the number of hosts are strikingly large, with up to 1.85 times as many hosts as lines in MAR10 using the OS + browser version counting method. This is significantly higher than the estimations by Beverly [3] from 2004, who estimated 1.09 times more hosts than IPs. This discrepancy may be due to several factors:
- 6 additional years of NAT gateway deployment.
- Different vantage points (Internet peering/exchange point vs. broadband access).
- Different observation periods (1 hour vs. 24 hours).
- Different information bases (SYN trace vs. TTL plus HTTP logs).

### 4.2 Number of Hosts Per Line

Given that we observe many more hosts than lines with active hosts, we next investigate lower bounds for the number of lines with more than one host. A large fraction of such lines implies many public IP addresses with more than one host, thus limiting the utility of IPs as host identifiers. We find that 30–52% of lines have more than one active host (Table 4, rows E.1 and E.2). Notably, between APR09 and AUG09a, the number of lines with more than one host increases significantly (OS + browser version, row E.2). This increase can be attributed to greater browser heterogeneity following the release of MSIE 8 in late March 2009.

For example, if two hosts on a DSL line both use WinXP and MSIE 7, they cannot be distinguished. However, if one host is upgraded to MSIE 8 while the other remains on MSIE 7, they can be distinguished.

In **Figure 1**, we provide a detailed look at the fraction of lines with \( n \) hosts. We observe up to 7% of lines with more than 3 hosts. To determine whether this high number of lines with multiple hosts is due to multiple computers (PCs or Macs), mobile hand-held devices (e.g., iPhones), or game consoles (e.g., Wii), we examine the HTTP user-agent string. Even after excluding mobile hand-held devices and game consoles, 25–28% (OS only; 34–45% with OS + browser version) of lines still have more than one host. Therefore, we conclude that the number of DSL lines with multiple end-hosts is only slightly influenced by mobile devices. In [6], we provide a detailed investigation of mobile device usage.

### 4.3 NAT Analysis with Different Data Set Types

As discussed in Section 3.4, we use reduced data sets ("http," "no TTL," and "no useragent") and compare the NAT usage estimates to those based on the full data set available to us ("all"). **Figure 1** compares the number of hosts per line for the different data sets. Without HTTP user-agent data, there is no difference between the scheme for OS only and OS + browser version. The most accuracy is lost when relying on IP TTL only ("no useragent"). Removing the IP TTL ("no TTL") information shows slightly better results. Compared to "all" information using HTTP logs annotated with TTL information (but discarding all non-HTTP activity, "http"), it provides a very good estimate of NAT prevalence.

### 5 Impact of Shorter Time-Scales

So far, we have limited our discussion to a static view of NAT behavior, i.e., analyzing whether a DSL line is NATed and how many hosts are connected via this line. If a line has more than one host, IP addresses cannot be reliably used as host identifiers over a 24-hour period. However, it is possible that even though a line has two hosts, the first host is only active in the morning while the second host is only active in the evening. This can reduce the ambiguity of using IP addresses as host identifiers over smaller time intervals (e.g., by utilizing timeouts).

### 5.1 Analysis Approach

To determine if multiple devices are used simultaneously, we compute the minimal inter-activity time (mIAT) between any two HTTP requests issued by different hosts on the same DSL line. If we observe an mIAT of \( T \) seconds, then we know that two or more distinct hosts were active on the line within \( T \) seconds. For this analysis, we use HTTP request logs, which correspond to the "http" data type and the OS-only counting method. These logs include timestamps for every request. We rely on Bro [9] for HTTP parsing.

### 5.2 Results

**Figure 2** plots the fraction of lines with two or more hosts for increasing mIATs. This plot enables us to study how close in time two (or more) hosts are active via the same line, allowing us to estimate how much ambiguity can be reduced by using a timeout.

Even with intervals as low as 1 second, we observe more than 10% of DSL lines with multiple hosts (12% for MAR10). When considering mIATs of 1 hour, around 20% of lines have activity from multiple hosts (18% for SEP08 up to 22% for MAR10). We conclude that if a line has multiple hosts, they are likely active at the same time or within a short time period. The lines start to level off at around 10 hours, likely due to the time interval that users actively use their computers, as opposed to using them around the clock. We confirm these results by applying the static analysis (see Sections 3.2 and 4.2) for slices of the traces, i.e., subdividing each trace into time bins of 1, 5, 10, 30, and 60 minutes and repeating the analysis for each bin.

### 6 Discussion

This study aims to estimate the number of active end-hosts per DSL line. Our methodology likely underestimates the number of end-hosts per line since we cannot distinguish between hosts with identical OS and browser software. This renders our approach problematic for networks with homogeneous OS/software installations (e.g., businesses). However, our approach already reveals a significant number of hosts per DSL line. Furthermore, the DSL lines in our data sets are for residential customers. The ISP also offers different but comparable DSL plans for small businesses. Parsing additional application protocol headers might reveal additional hosts that were not counted, e.g., P2P peer IDs, but only a small fraction of DSL lines use P2P [5].

On the other hand, there are factors that can bias our results towards overestimating the number of hosts per DSL line. For example, a computer with two OSes installed (e.g., in a dual-boot or virtualized setup) is counted as two different hosts. It is debatable whether this is incorrect. Similarly, if a user updates their browser during our observation period, the same machine is counted twice. However, these artifacts decrease as we consider shorter time-frames since it requires time to reboot another OS and/or update a browser. Therefore, the results for small mIATs are reasonable lower bounds for the number of hosts per line.

We also note that some NAT gateways might not decrement the TTL. If such a NAT gateway is used, we would classify the DSL as unNATed. However, if multiple hosts are connected through such a gateway, we can still detect them. We have not found any evidence that a significant number of such non-decrementing gateways are used by our user population.

### 7 Conclusion

We presented a novel approach for detecting DSL lines that use network address translation (NAT) to connect to the Internet. Our approach can infer the presence of a NAT device and provide lower bounds for the number of hosts connected behind the NAT gateway. For lines with multiple hosts, we studied the temporal behavior to see whether multiple hosts are active at the same time. Our approach relies on IP TTL information and HTTP user-agent strings, and we analyze the accuracy when using less information (e.g., TTLs only, or user-agent strings only) for the NAT analysis. We find that most accuracy is lost when user-agent strings are omitted.

We find that 10% of DSL lines have more than one host active at the same time, and 20% of lines have multiple hosts that are active within one hour of each other. Overall, 30–52% of lines have multiple hosts. These results underscore the perils involved when using IPs as host identifiers.

In future work, we plan to investigate NAT behavior over a number of consecutive days and augment our analysis with IPIDs and ephemeral ports. Combining IP address churn [5] and NAT behavior, we further plan to assess the effect and potential error of utilizing IPs as host identifiers.
