Source project about whose software a book is sold.
Writing for Packt
We welcome all inquiries from people who are interested in authoring. Book proposals

would like to discuss it first before writing a formal book proposal, contact us; one of our
commissioning editors will get in touch with you.
We're not just looking for published authors; if you have strong technical skills but no writing
experience, our experienced editors can help you develop a writing career, or simply get some
additional reward for your expertise.
