In some situations we would like to use kubernetes without needing a docker
registry. We store images on a shared nfs file system by using `docker export
-o container.tar some-container`. On docker hosts we then import that image
using `docker import` and run the container.
It would be great if kubernetes could also support this so dependency on
public internet access to the docker hub and running an internal registry are
not required.
