In certain scenarios, it is desirable to use Kubernetes without relying on a Docker registry. We currently store container images on a shared NFS (Network File System) by exporting them with the `docker export -o container.tar some-container` command. On Docker hosts, we then import these images using `docker import` and subsequently run the containers.

It would be highly beneficial if Kubernetes could natively support this workflow, thereby eliminating the need for public internet access to Docker Hub or the requirement to run an internal registry.
