Real case scenario: I want to pass an extra parameter to a route (see docs),
and the value of such parameter is an object. The typical example is a `Uuid`
object (e.g. Ramsey\Uuid).  
Problem is that PHP is not smart enough and it does not cast objects to
string. See related bug on php.net.  
Of couse, such feature could be easily obtained in a typical plain PHP
context, since it's very easy to cast your object to a string.  
In a typical Symfony context, instead, you can't easily cast strings, unless
doing ugly things.
Example of not working code:
    {# generated URL has no query string #}
    my link
Example of working code, with ugly workaround:
    {# generated URL has expected query string, e.g. ?foo=7ecff38e-4145-11e8-80b9-0242ac140004 #}
    my link
My proposal is: inside `doGenerate` method of `UrlGenerator` class, Symfony
should cast parameters to string before passing them to `http_build_query`
