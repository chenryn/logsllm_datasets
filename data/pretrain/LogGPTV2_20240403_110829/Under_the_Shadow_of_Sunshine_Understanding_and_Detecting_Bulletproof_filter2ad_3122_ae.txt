### Challenges in Validating Sub-allocations

Sub-allocations within network blocks present a significant challenge for result validation, primarily due to the difficulty in obtaining ground truth. Traditional methods, such as correlating detected domains and IP addresses against blacklists or using malware detectors (e.g., VirusTotal), are insufficient. To validate a sub-allocation as a true positive, one must find overwhelming evidence that it has hosted malicious or abusive content, or that its resources have been compromised. This in-depth investigation can only be performed on a case-by-case basis and is not easily quantifiable.

### Quantifying Accuracy of the Classifier

To quantify the accuracy of our classifier, we compute a set of indicators that reflect suspicious or outright malicious sub-allocations. For consistency and comparison, these indicators are applied to both the detected sub-allocations and the labeled clean and malicious sets. The following are the key indicators:

1. **Non-operational TLD+3:**
   - **Description:** We perform real-time DNS lookups on over 570 million TLD+3 domains hosted by the detected and labeled sub-allocations to identify those that have ceased to operate.
   - **Method:** We measure the percentage of TLD+3 that return an NXDomain, non-existent domain, or are parked with a domain parking service.
   - **Observation:** Legitimate services tend to last longer, while malicious ones typically have a shorter lifespan. As shown in Figure 9(a), the sub-allocations detected by both trained models (Set-A and Set-B) and the labeled malicious set have a much higher rate of non-operational TLD+3 compared to the labeled clean set.

2. **Presence in Blacklists:**
   - **Description:** We cross-match the TLD+3 and IP addresses of the sub-allocations against three blacklists (Table III).
   - **Observation:** Figures 9(b) and 9(c) show a larger presence of detected sub-allocations in blacklists compared to the clean set. However, many do not appear in blacklists, making this indicator somewhat weaker.

3. **Distribution of FQDNs over TLD+3:**
   - **Description:** By manually sampling the detected sub-allocations, we observed a pattern where many TLD+3 are hosted on a single FQDN.
   - **Method:** We quantify this as the ratio of #FQDNs/#TLD+3, as shown in Figure 9(d).
   - **Observation:** Even though the labeled clean and malicious sub-allocations have fewer instances of this pattern, confirmed malicious sub-allocations show a higher rate of TLD+3 per FQDN. This is due to the selected features that implicitly capture such behavior.

4. **Future Whois De-listing:**
   - **Description:** We check the most recent Whois snapshot to determine if any detected sub-allocations have been de-listed.
   - **Observation:** 3.3% of the clean, 78% of the malicious, and 5.5% of the detected sets were de-listed. Further analysis revealed that one hosting provider (xlhost.com) in the clean set owned 77% of the de-listed sub-allocations, with an average size of 8 IP addresses per sub-allocation. Excluding this outlier, the de-listing percentage for the clean set drops to 0.76%.

### Manual Sampling for False Positives

To further validate the results, we manually sampled sub-allocations and investigated them case by case for false positives. Sampling was done in two ways:

1. **Random Sampling:**
   - **Method:** We randomly sampled 20 sub-allocations. If a sub-allocation could not be clearly classified, another sample was taken.
   - **Result:** Out of 20 samples, 1 turned out to be a false positive.

2. **Biased Sampling:**
   - **Method:** We sampled sub-allocations owned by Akamai or educational institutions, old sub-allocations registered before the year 2000, and sub-allocations with one FQDN (totaling 2,612).
   - **Result:** If all are considered false positives, even though some were actually compromised, the false discovery rate (FDR) would be 4%.

### Breakdown of Detected Sub-allocations

- **Duration:** December 25th, 2015 - August 21st, 2016
- **Snapshots:** 25
- **Total Sub-allocations:** 39K
- **Sub-allocations with Owners:** 28K (71.5%)
- **Number of ASes:** 3,200
- **Number of Owners:** 19K

### Performance Comparison

Figure 10 compares the performance of our classifier to Whois de-listing, showing that 17K (44%) of the sub-allocations were detected on the first day, with 738 de-listed in Whois after an average of 1,500 days. The remaining sub-allocations were detected with an average delay of 130 days.

### Exploring the BPH Ecosystem

#### Landscape

- **Daily Average Sub-allocations:** 192K
- **Detection Rate:** 20K (10%) per processed snapshot
- **Total Detected Sub-allocations:** 39K
- **First Day Detection:** 17K (44%)

#### Service Providers

- **Overview:** We detected sub-allocations hosted on 3,200 ASes, with 50 service providers accounting for more than half of the detected sub-allocations.
- **Top ASes:**
  - **PEG TECH INC:** Hosting 7% of detected sub-allocations, with a history of ignoring abuse complaints.
  - **VPSQuan LLC:** Hosting 37% of its sub-allocations, known for abusive activities.
  - **Psychz Networks:** Hosting 20% of its sub-allocations, also with a history of ignored abuse complaints.

#### Recycling

- **Definition:** We define a "Recycling" rate to capture the frequency of network block delegation, accounting for legitimate business expansion.
- **Calculation:** 
  \[
  \text{Recycling Rate} = \frac{\# \text{ of Network Blocks Added} + \# \text{ of Network Blocks Dropped}}{\text{Total Number of Blocks}}
  \]
- **Observation:** ASes like VPSQuan LLC and Psychz Networks had a recycling rate of zero, indicating no efforts to clean up IP reputations. Data centers, on the other hand, had a high recycling rate, actively moving network blocks between owners.

#### Re-branding

- **Example:** ColoCrossing, ranked 15th in recycling rates, had a 3.5% recycling rate and a network block lifespan of 200 days. Our investigation revealed a network of subsidiaries and resellers, with re-branding and creation of new entities to move network blocks.

### Conclusion

Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the BPH ecosystem, highlighting the role of service providers and their complicitness in malicious activities. The use of recycling and re-branding strategies by some ASes underscores the need for more robust detection methods to combat these evasion techniques.
