Question: "A developer is designing a feature for an Android app that involves playing music in the background while the user navigates between different activities within the app. The music should continue to play uninterrupted regardless of user interactions with the app's UI. Which Android application component should be used to implement this feature, and what is a major advantage of using this component for such a task?"
 "A": "Activity, because it directly interacts with the user interface and can run background processes efficiently."
 "B": "Service, because it can perform long-running operations in the background without needing a user interface."
 "C": "Broadcast Receiver, because it can continuously listen for and respond to broadcast intents, making it suitable for background music playback."
 "D": "AndroidManifest.xml, because it defines the app's components and can handle background processes like music playback."
Answer: B
