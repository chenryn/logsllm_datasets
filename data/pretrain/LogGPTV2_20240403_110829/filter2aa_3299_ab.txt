So what?
In addition to SSO, also supports:
Federation − the sharing of identity between domains
(MDSSO)
Delegation − maintenance of identity to backend services
Distribution of Directory information to other applications,
which gives us:
ABAC (Attribute Based Access Control) = RBAC+
Support for Federation ⇒ SAML suitable for the cloud

WS-Federation [6]
Approved OASIS speciﬁcation
Deﬁnes mechanisms to allow diﬀerent security realms to
federate
authorized access to resources managed in one realm
can be provided to principals
whose identities and attributes are managed in other realms
Includes mechanisms for brokering of identity, attribute,
authentication and authorization assertions between realms

OASIS SAML V2.0 Technical Overview (draft 3 and 10)

[11] SAML use case No.1: ”Limitations of Browser cookies”
[12] Driver of SAML adoption No.1: ”Multi Domain SSO ...
However, since browser cookies are never transmitted between
DNS domains, ... SAML solves the MDSSO problem.”
True issue, legitimate will but...
Can also be read as: ”SOP sucks, let’s build a workaround!”
Great potential for security issues
Is it a fail or not?
E.g. Can a bad guy steal cookies?
Be patient ;-)

Custom scripts
Methodology

Generally accepted best practices [14][15]

Adapt your toolset
”Don’t be a tool” [20][21] but...
Properly using the right tools often makes
the diﬀerence
Time constraint
Two reasons
Allow ”traditional” assessment of Web apps and services
protected by SAML tokens
Conﬁgurations of such architectures is crucial yet complex
error prone
need tools to assess good conﬁguration settings are eﬀective
