This is a highly useful feature that I greatly miss from Sublime Text. For instance, if I have a filename like `TopSecretAlgorithm.js` and my cursor is at the beginning of the word:

```
|TopSecretAlgorithm.js
```

I could press `Ctrl+Right Arrow` once to move the cursor to the start of `Secret`:

```
Top|SecretAlgorithm.js
```

Pressing it again would move the cursor to the start of `Algorithm`:

```
TopSecret|Algorithm.js
```

I hope this explanation is clear. If someone could guide me on where to implement this functionality, I would be happy to submit a pull request.
