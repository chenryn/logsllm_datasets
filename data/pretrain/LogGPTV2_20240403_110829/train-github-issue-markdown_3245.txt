This is a super-useful feature that I miss from Sublime.
For example, given the filename `TopSecretAlgorithm.js`, with my cursor at the
front of the word:
    |TopSecretAlgorithm.js
I could press `ctrl+right` once to get over to `Secret`:
    Top|SecretAlgorithm.js
again to get over to `Algorithm`:
    TopSecret|Algorithm.js
Get it? I would be happy to submit a PR if someone can point me in the right
direction of where I should implement this.
