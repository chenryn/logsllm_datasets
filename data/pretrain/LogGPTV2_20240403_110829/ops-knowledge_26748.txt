User: I have a custom C++ Python Module that I want to build into Python that builds fine but fails when it goes to the linking stage. I have determined that the problem is that it is using the gcc to link and not g++ and this is what is causing all of the errors I am seeing when it tries to link in the std libraries. How would I get the Python build process to link with g++ instead of gcc? Do I have to manually edit the Makefile or is it something I need to set when I am configuring it. I am compiling Python 2.6 on CentOS 5.8. 
Thanks in advance for the help!
Assistant: I was able to solve my problem by manually editing the Makefile generated by the configure script so that the linker was using g++ instead of gcc and that solved my problems. Thanks for the possible suggestions!
