User: When using Nginx as a reverse proxy, how to configure an SSL certificate and enable the HTTPS protocol?
Assistant: To configure an SSL certificate and enable the HTTPS protocol on Nginx, you need to perform the following steps: 1. Obtain an SSL certificate and private key, which can be purchased from an SSL certificate provider or self-signed. 2. Store the SSL certificate and private key in a secure directory on the server. It is recommended to put them in a separate directory, such as /etc/nginx/ssl. 3. Add the following lines to the Nginx configuration file: ``` server { listen 443 ssl; server_name example.com; ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/example.com.crt; ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/example.com .key; location / { proxy_pass http://backend_server; } } ``` In this example we enable SSL on port 443 and set the certificate and private key paths to /etc/nginx/ssl/example.com .crt and /etc/nginx/ssl/example.com.key. 4. Restart the Nginx server for the changes to take effect: ``` sudo service nginx restart ``` Now, your Nginx server has an SSL certificate configured and the HTTPS protocol enabled.
