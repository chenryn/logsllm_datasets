User: Can you recommend me book to Google App Engine in Python?
English/French books are both accepted.
Assistant: I come back to this question after sereval searches.
I rode Programming Google App Engine by Dan Sanderson and Using Google App Engine by Charles Severance (both edited O'Reilly and Google Press) and they are pretty good.
I recommend it for basic usage.
