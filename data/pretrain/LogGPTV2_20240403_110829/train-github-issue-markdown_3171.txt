I set the port of the broker to be 3212 and the backed to be 3213 so I can
distinguish them.  
We found the issue since our GKE is behind a NAT, which doesn't like idle
connections, so we get a lot of "Connection reset by peer"
We also set `broker_pool_limit` to 3 but as you can see there are much more.
