User: Write a Python script that automates the creation and configuration of network devices.
Assistant: This question is very open and broad, because there are many types and brands of network devices, and each brand has its own unique CLI or API, so it is necessary to choose the appropriate tools and libraries to write scripts according to the actual situation. To give a simple example, if you need to automatically configure Cisco network devices, you can use the Netmiko library to achieve it. Netmiko is a Python library for managing ssh connections to various network devices. First you need to install Netmiko: ```bash pip install netmiko ``` Below is a simple example showing how to use Netmiko to connect to a Cisco router and execute commands: ```python from netmiko import ConnectHandler # Define device information device = { " device_type": "cisco_ios", "host": "192.168.1.1", "username": "admin", "password": "password" } # Connect to the device with ConnectHandler(**device) as net_connect: # Send a command and print the output output = net_connect.send_command("show ip interface brief") print(output) ``` This code connects to the Cisco router with IP address 192.168.1.1, authenticates with username admin and password password , send the show ip interface brief command, and print the output. You can customize this script to meet your specific needs.
