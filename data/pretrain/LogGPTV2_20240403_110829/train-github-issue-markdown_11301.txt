    * All
  * **Last Known Working Electron version:**
    * 6.1.4
### Expected Behavior
When doing a request with `net` and the server responds with a status-code
that signifies an error, the user can still read the response's body.
### Actual Behavior
It is impossible to read the reponse's body, as the response object emits a
`net::ERR_HTTP_RESPONSE_CODE_FAILURE` error and stops.
### To Reproduce
    $ git clone https://github.com/arantes555/electron-bug-net-body-when-error.git
    $ npm install
    $ npm start
### Additional Information
This is a critical problem with `net`. In addition to making it impossible to
implement `fetch` interface correctly, it simply makes `net` unsuitable for
anything serious, as reading the body of the response (no matter the status-
code) is at the core of what an HTTP request is.
