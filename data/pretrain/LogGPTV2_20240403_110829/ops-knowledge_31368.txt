User: For the following situations, please describe how to do a good job of Linux system security hardening. 1. The server version is too old and there are known security vulnerabilities\n2. The SSH port uses the default port 22\n3. The root account directly uses a password to log in\n4. No firewall is configured or the firewall rules are loose\n5. The system log is not timely backup and monitoring
Assistant: In view of the above situation, the following measures can be taken to enhance system security: 1. Timely update the operating system and software packages, upgrade to newer versions, and timely patch known vulnerabilities. 2. Modify the SSH port, use a relatively high non-default port, and restrict SSH access only to specified IP addresses through the firewall. 3. Forbid the root user to log in remotely through a password, and instead use the SSH key for authentication. At the same time, policies for strong password requirements and regular password changes can be made for ordinary users. 4. Enable the firewall and restrict port access as required to deny unnecessary inbound traffic. Firewall rules should follow the principle of least privilege, only allow necessary services and ports, and review and update rules regularly. 5. Configure system log dump and backup, realize log audit and monitoring, and timely discover and respond to system abnormal events. You can use log management tools, such as rsyslog, logrotate, etc., to configure strategies such as log segmentation, compression, backup, and forwarding, so that the logs can be audited and traced. In addition, security tools such as intrusion detection systems (IDS) and vulnerability scanners can also be considered to detect system vulnerabilities and abnormal behaviors in real time, and take corresponding measures to deal with them. At the same time, formulate emergency response plans and vulnerability repair plans to ensure system security and practical feasibility.
