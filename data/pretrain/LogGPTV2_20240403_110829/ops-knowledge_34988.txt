User: I am doing some performance measurement of my code on a Windows box and I am finding that I am getting dramatically different results between measurements.  A quick bit of ad hoc exploration during a slow one shows in the task manager System Idle Processes taking up almost 100% CPU.
Does anyone know what System Idle Processes actually means and what Windows features it may be running?  
NB: I am not measuring performance using the task manager, I just used it to take a look at what else was running during a particularly slow measurement.
Please think before saying this is not programming related and closing the question.  I would not ask it unless I thought there were grounds to say it is.  In this case I believe it clearly is because it is detrimentally affecting my development and test environments and in order to sort it out I need to know a bit more about it.  Programming does not start and end with the writing of the code.
Assistant: If you "system idle process" is taking up 100% then essentially you machine is bored, nothing is going on.  If you add up everything going on in task manager, subtract this number from 100%, then you will have the value of "system idle process."  Notice it consumes almost no memory at all and cannot be affecting performance.
