User: OS X (Mavericks) has Python 2.7 stock installed. But I do all my own personal Python stuff with 3.3. I just flushed my 3.3.2 install and installed the new 3.3.3. So I need to install pyserial again. I can do it the way I've done it before, which is:

Download pyserial from pypi 
untar pyserial.tgz
cd pyserial
python3 setup.py install

But I'd like to do like the cool kids do, and just do something like pip3 install pyserial. But it's not clear how I get to that point. And just that point. Not interested (unless I have to be) in virtualenv yet.
Assistant: For a fresh new Mac, you need to follow below steps:-

Make sure you have installed Xcode
sudo easy_install pip
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

brew doctor

brew doctor
brew install python3

And you are done, just type python3 on terminal and you will see python 3 installed.
