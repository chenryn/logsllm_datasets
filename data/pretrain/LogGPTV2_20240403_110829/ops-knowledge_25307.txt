**Installing pyserial for Python 3.3.3 on OS X (Mavericks)**

OS X Mavericks comes with Python 2.7 pre-installed, but I prefer to use Python 3.3.3 for my personal projects. After recently upgrading from Python 3.3.2 to 3.3.3, I need to reinstall `pyserial`. 

### Method 1: Manual Installation
I can install `pyserial` manually by following these steps:
1. Download `pyserial` from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyserial/).
2. Untar the downloaded file: `tar -xzf pyserial-<version>.tar.gz`.
3. Navigate to the `pyserial` directory: `cd pyserial-<version>`.
4. Install `pyserial` using the setup script: `python3 setup.py install`.

### Method 2: Using pip3
To install `pyserial` using `pip3`, you first need to ensure that `pip3` is installed and properly configured. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

#### Prerequisites
1. **Install Xcode**: Make sure you have Xcode installed, as it provides essential development tools.
2. **Install Homebrew**: If you don't already have Homebrew, you can install it using the following command:
   ```sh
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```
3. **Install Python 3.3.3**: Use Homebrew to install Python 3.3.3:
   ```sh
   brew install python@3.3
   ```

#### Verify the Installation
Check if Python 3.3.3 is correctly installed by running:
```sh
python3 --version
```
You should see `Python 3.3.3` in the output.

#### Install pyserial using pip3
Now that `pip3` is available, you can install `pyserial` with the following command:
```sh
pip3 install pyserial
```

By following these steps, you will have `pyserial` installed for your Python 3.3.3 environment on OS X Mavericks.
