**Abstract:**

This paper presents a method for correlating security alerts by identifying common triggering events and shared resources. The approach aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of alert correlation in complex network environments.

**Introduction:**

In modern cybersecurity, the volume of security alerts generated by various monitoring systems can be overwhelming. Effective alert correlation is crucial for identifying and responding to potential threats. This paper introduces a novel technique that leverages the relationships between triggering events and common resources to enhance the correlation process.

**Methodology:**

Our methodology involves the following key steps:
1. **Event Extraction:** Identify and extract relevant triggering events from security logs.
2. **Resource Mapping:** Map these events to the resources they affect.
3. **Correlation Analysis:** Use a graph-based approach to correlate alerts based on the identified events and resources.

**Results:**

The proposed method was tested on a dataset of real-world security alerts. The results show a significant improvement in the accuracy of alert correlation, reducing false positives and improving the overall efficiency of the security response process.

**Conclusion:**

This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of using triggering events and common resources for alert correlation. Future work will focus on extending this approach to more complex and dynamic network environments.
