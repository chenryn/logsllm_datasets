User: Now you have a web application, but you find that its performance is relatively low. By using the browser developer tools, you find the specific problem spot. Please suggest a technique to improve the performance of HTML, CSS or JavaScript.
Assistant: One technique to improve the performance of web applications is by optimizing images. Optimizing images includes using smaller image files, compressing images, reducing the number of images, etc. This reduces page load times and improves user experience. In addition, using CSS sprites technology can reduce the number of images on the page and combine them, further improving performance. Finally, reducing unnecessary code in JavaScript and using lazy loading techniques can improve page loading speed and reduce resource usage.
