User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Managing Log File in SQL Server 2008 These are my current settings:

Recovery mode: Simple
Logfile initial size: 10 mb
Logfile autogrowth: None
Database auto shrink: Off

The logfile autogrowth is set to None because I don't want the logfile to grow. My objective is to keep the log file consistently small as I do not need it for recovery purposes. 

Are the both settings okay for that? 

Also,what happens if I have a big transaction involving numerous inserts and deletes (over 10 mb worth of change). Will the operation not complete because the log file ran out of space?

Assistant: In somple recovery model,. the log content is discarded every time a commit is done with no open transactions. This hsould happen quite often.
IF the log overloads, the db can not commit. Changes will be rolled back. Note that in simple model that would be RARE, but it MAY be theoreitcallys possible. I would call that ery theorettical, though.
At the same time, you can not use log backups to make point in time recovery.
