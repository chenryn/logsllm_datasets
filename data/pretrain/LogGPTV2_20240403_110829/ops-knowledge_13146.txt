User: I installed Anaconda for Python 2.7 on my Windows machine and wanted to add the Anaconda interpreter to PyDev, but quick googling couldn't find the default place where Anaconda installed, and searching SO didn't turn up anything useful, so.
Where does Anaconda 4.0 install on Windows 7?
Assistant: With Anaconda prompt python is available, but on any other command window, python is an unknown program. Apparently Anaconda installation does not update the path for python executable.
