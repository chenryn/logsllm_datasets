### Environment & Settings
- **Celery version**: 5.1.2

### Steps to Reproduce
In Celery `4.4.7`, I used to clean my dynamic tasks on startup as follows:
```python
from celery.bin import amqp

@app.on_after_finalize.connect
def setup_periodic_tasks(sender, **kwargs):
    amqp_ = amqp.amqp(app=app)
    amqp_.run('queue.purge', 'my_task_queue_name')
    # ... task definitions follow ...
```

After upgrading to `v5.1.2`, the following line:
```python
amqp_ = amqp.amqp(app=app)
```
raises the error:
```
__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'app'
```

Removing the `app` parameter results in:
```
'NoneType' object has no attribute 'error'
```

I also tried:
```python
from celery.bin.purge import purge
# ...
purge(args)  # But couldn't match the command's arguments
```

Additionally, I tried:
```python
app = Celery('my_project')
# ...
app.control.purge()
```
However, I am concerned that this would purge all queues, not just the specific one I need.

The documentation for Celery `4.4.7` is available, but the equivalent page for `v5.1.2` is missing.
