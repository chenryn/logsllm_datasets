### Comparison of Code Coverage and XSS Injection Detection

**Figure 2.** Each bar in the figure compares our scanner, Black Widow, to one other scanner on a web application. The bars show three fractions: unique lines found by Black Widow, lines found by both scanners, and lines uniquely found by the other scanner.

**Coverage Analysis:**
- **Unique Lines of Code:** The number of unique lines of code executed on the server.
- **Black Widow's Performance:** Black Widow achieves the highest coverage in 9 out of 10 web applications.
- **Baseline Comparison (Wget):** Table I illustrates that Black Widow increases coverage by almost 500% in SCARF and 256% in modern production software like PrestaShop, compared to Wget.
- **Comparison with State-of-the-Art Crawlers:** Compared to state-of-the-art crawlers like j Â¨Ak and Enemy of the State, Black Widow shows more than 100% increase in coverage for SCARF and 320% for modern applications like PrestaShop. However, Enemy of the State has the highest coverage on Drupal, which is discussed in detail in Section V-A.

**Challenges in Calculating Perfect Coverage:**
- While it would be beneficial to know how far we are from perfect coverage, calculating a ground truth for the total number of lines of code is difficult. Aggregating the number of lines in the source code can misrepresent dynamic code (e.g., `eval`) and count dead code (e.g., installation code).

**Combined Efforts Comparison:**
- **Table II** compares Black Widow to the combined efforts of other scanners, showing the number of lines of code that Black Widow finds which none of the others find, the combined coverage of the others, and our improvement in coverage.
- In large applications like PrestaShop, Black Widow was able to find 53,266 lines of code that none of the others found. For smaller applications like phpBB, the improvement is up to 46.7% compared to the current state-of-the-art.

**Overlap in Lines of Code:**
- To better understand which parts of the application the scanners are exploring, we compare the overlap in the lines of code between the scanners.
- **Table III** presents the comparison of unique lines of code found by Black Widow (A \ B) and the other scanners (B \ A). The improvement is calculated as the number of unique lines found by Black Widow divided by the total number of lines the other crawlers find.

**Visualization:**
- **Figure 2** plots the comparison for all scanners on all platforms. Each bar represents the fraction of lines of code attributed to each crawler. The bars are sorted by the difference in unique lines found by Black Widow and the other crawlers.
- Black Widow finds the highest number of unique lines of code in all cases except for Drupal, where Enemy of the State performed better.

**XSS Injection Detection:**
- **Table IV** shows the number of reported XSS injections by the scanners and their classification as either reflected or stored.
- **Table V** presents the number of unique and correct XSS injections by the scanners, also classified as reflected or stored.

This comprehensive analysis demonstrates the superior performance of Black Widow in terms of code coverage and XSS injection detection across various web applications.
