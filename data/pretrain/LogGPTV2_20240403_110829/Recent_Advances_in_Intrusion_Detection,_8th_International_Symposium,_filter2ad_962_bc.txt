### CGI Application

**T1-mod:** This test is identical to T1-cgi, with the exception that PHP was running as an Apache2 module.

**T2-cgi:** This test involved requesting the webpage `phpBB2/profile.php?mode=editprofile&sid=`, which contains the content of a forum with a valid session ID. The test included multiple database reads and complex output formatting, involving numerous string operations (e.g., creating a complex form with user-supplied data). PHP was configured to run as a CGI application.

**T2-mod:** This test is the same as T2-cgi, but with PHP running as an Apache2 module.

**T3-CLI:** This test used the standard PHP test script (`run-tests.php`) included in the PHP source code. This script runs tests designed by PHP developers to verify the correctness of PHP. Note that these tests do not involve a web server and are generally not I/O intensive, so the expected impact of CSSE (Context-Sensitive String Evaluation) should be lower compared to T1 and T2.

### Run-Time Overhead Evaluation

The results of the run-time overhead evaluation are presented in Table 2. Tests T1-cgi, T1-mod, T2-cgi, and T2-mod were executed 600 times, with the first 100 runs discarded to eliminate caching artifacts. Timings were recorded by the Apache server. Due to the long run time, the T3-CLI test was only executed 20 times. The table also includes 95% confidence intervals for each set of experiments. All measurements were conducted on a single machine with a Pentium M processor running at 1.7 GHz, 1 GB of RAM, and Linux 2.6.8.

We tested PHP in three configurations:
- **Unpatched:** Normal PHP source code compiled with standard options.
- **CSSE disabled:** PHP was patched to include CSSE, but CSSE was disabled via a runtime configuration option. The overhead includes checking the state of a PHP global configuration flag in each modified method.
- **CSSE enabled:** PHP was patched to include CSSE, and CSSE was enabled.

All tests produced identical output across the three configurations, with variations only in execution time.

### Performance Impact

Our observations indicate that the total run-time overhead does not exceed 8% of the total run time when PHP runs as a CGI application. Surprisingly, the overhead increases to 17% when PHP runs as an Apache2 module. This is illustrated in Figure 3, where black bars represent the execution time of unpatched PHP, grey bars show the overhead with CSSE disabled, and light grey bars indicate the overhead with CSSE enabled. As expected, the performance overhead for non-I/O intensive operations (the last test with a standalone PHP interpreter) is only around 2% of the total execution time.

It is important to note that these numbers should be interpreted in the context of the goals set for our prototype. Since the prototype is limited to the most commonly used string operations, our measurements may underestimate the actual performance impact. However, this underestimation is minimal because the calls to the instrumented string functions account for a significant portion of the total number of string function calls. Additionally, our prototype is not optimized for performance, and using an alternative metadata representation as zval values could improve performance.

Contrary to expectations, the CSSE overhead was more than 2.5 times higher when PHP was running as a module rather than as a CGI application, even with a simple flag check to determine whether CSSE is enabled. This is likely due to threading issues, resulting in loading the entire runtime configuration data in each string operation, which could be mitigated with a more carefully designed prototype.

Another interesting observation is that PHP running as an Apache2 module does not provide a significant performance increase compared to a CGI application. This is attributed to our experimental setup, where the PHP interpreter was already cached in memory and was running a single task. In normal operation, Apache2 modules are typically faster than CGI applications.

In conclusion, the overall performance overhead is application-dependent. Our tests suggest that it ranges from 2% for applications with few I/O operations to around 10% for typical web applications with PHP running with a web server.

### Memory Efficiency

In the current implementation, strings containing at least one untrusted part consume twice as much memory as their normal counterparts. To investigate the memory efficiency of CSSE, we analyzed the heap allocation of CSSE-enabled PHP using Valgrind [19]. For both T1 and T2 tests, the impact of CSSE was around 2% (40kB increase for a total of approximately 2MB allocated heap). This is intuitive, as only a small amount of memory allocated by PHP is used for storing PHP variables, some of which contain strings with user data. These results are application-dependent but should be similar for typical web applications.

Various optimization techniques can be applied to reduce the additional memory storage, but this was beyond the scope of our prototype. Our results show that even with this inefficient implementation, the memory impact is negligible.

### Conclusions and Future Work

Injection vulnerabilities are a significant problem in application-level security. In this work, we identified the root cause of these vulnerabilities: the ad-hoc serialization of user-provided input. We provided a unifying view of injection vulnerabilities, which facilitates reasoning about this class of vulnerabilities and allows for the prediction of new types of related vulnerabilities.

Based on our improved understanding, we developed Context-Sensitive String Evaluation (CSSE), a novel method for defending against injection attacks. CSSE addresses the root cause of injection vulnerabilities by enforcing strict channel separation while still allowing the convenient use of ad-hoc serialization. CSSE is transparent to the application developer, as the necessary checks are enforced at the platform level, requiring neither modification nor analysis of the applications. This makes it advantageous over other related solutions, such as safe ad-hoc serialization and serialization APIs.

CSSE works by automatically marking all user-originated data with metadata about its origin and ensuring that this metadata is preserved and updated when operations are performed on the data. The metadata enables a CSSE-enabled platform to automatically carry out the necessary checks at a very late stage, namely when the output expressions are ready to be sent to the handling component. At this point, the complete context of the output expressions is known, allowing CSSE to independently determine and execute the appropriate checks on the data it previously marked as unsafe.

We developed a prototype implementation of CSSE for the PHP platform and evaluated it with phpBB, a large real-life application. Our prototype prevented all known SQL injection attacks with a performance impact of approximately 10%.

As ongoing work, we are instrumenting the remaining string operations and output vectors to prevent more sophisticated injection attacks, including XSS attacks, and evaluating CSSE with other applications. We will also develop an application-level implementation of CSSE for a platform that supports the aspect-oriented programming paradigm.

#### Abstract

A popular class of host-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are those based on comparing the system call trace of a process against a set of k-grams. However, the detection mechanism in such IDS can be evaded by cloaking an attack as a mimicry attack. In this paper, we present an algorithm that transforms a detectable attack into a mimicry attack. We demonstrate on several examples that using this algorithm, mimicry attacks can be easily constructed on self-based IDS with a set of k-grams and a more precise graph profile representation. We enhance the IDS by making use of the system call arguments and process credentials. To avoid increasing false positives, a supplied specification is used to abstract the system call arguments and process credentials. The specification takes into account what objects in the system can be sensitive to potential attacks and highlights the occurrence of "dangerous" operations. With this simple extension, we show that the robustness of the IDS is increased. Our preliminary experiments show that on our example programs and attacks, it was no longer possible to construct mimicry attacks. We also demonstrate that the enhanced IDS provides resistance to a variety of common attacks.
