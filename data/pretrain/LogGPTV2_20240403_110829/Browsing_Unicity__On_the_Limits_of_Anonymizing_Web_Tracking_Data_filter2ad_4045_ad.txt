### Temporal Coarsening and Unicity in Web Tracking Data

In the context of web tracking, industry standards for temporal coarsening typically range from tens of minutes [4]. In our study, we extend this to slightly more than a day to provide a more comprehensive overview. We first conduct a series of experiments on the entire sample across all sites, and then repeat these experiments on trace sets per site.

#### Expectations and Rationale
We anticipate high unicity (i.e., the likelihood that a click trace is unique) in experiments with detailed auxiliary information and timestamps, and no length restrictions. The common rationale is that coarsening data suffices to anonymize tracking data. Therefore, we expect unicity to decrease significantly in subsequent experiments with lower granularity.

#### Results of the First Series of Experiments
The results of the first series of experiments are shown in Fig. 2. We observe that unicity is highly dependent on the coarseness of the timestamps. Reducing the accuracy of the timing to the order of seconds or minutes obscures the exact instant of a click but retains details about intervals between page calls. When all information about the client and page is removed, unicity remains above 60% for high temporal resolutions.

When timestamps are coarsened to the order of hours, most differences in the intervals between clicks are lost, preserving only the time of day and sequence information of the clicks. At high granularity, similar to the data in current tracking databases, over 70% of all traces remain unique. Removing location and all page information except the website domain reduces unicity to slightly below 40%.

Further coarsening timestamps to the day of the click removes differences in time zones and daily browsing habits. With full information about the page and location, over half of all click traces remain unique. Even when only the number of clicks per day on the websites contained in a trace is known, unicity remains above 20%. Only when all auxiliary information is deleted and timestamps are coarsened to the order of hours or days do we observe unicity values converging to 0, indicating that the database is effectively anonymized.

#### Trimming Sessions and Click Trace Length
Longer click traces exhibit higher unicity than short ones. At session lengths greater than 50 clicks, even strong coarsening has little effect. This is intuitive because the attribute of a click trace's length becomes increasingly characteristic with increasing length. Limiting the length of click traces should, therefore, increase anonymity.

In a second series of experiments, we reduce the length of click traces while using all auxiliary information about clients and pages. The results, shown in Fig. 3, indicate that unicity can be significantly reduced as the trace length decreases, particularly at high timestamp granularity. However, truly low unicity values are only reached when traces are limited to one or two clicks and timestamps are coarsened to at least several hours. Even with traces of just four clicks and a time resolution of hours, over 40% of all click traces remain unique.

Our dataset contains session fragments with only one or two clicks, which may not be representative of typical browsing sessions. To assess their impact on unicity, we performed another series of experiments with increasing minimum length. As short click traces are less likely to be unique, removing them should increase unicity. The results, shown in Figs. 4 and 5, confirm that unicity rises sharply by over 20% when click traces consisting of only one or two clicks are removed.

#### Unicity of Local Tracking
Finally, we examined the unicity of local tracking, where websites keep log files containing the clicks of their own visitors. Click traces within single sites are shorter than those of multi-domain sessions, and the universe of different pages within a single site is smaller. Given these points, we expect the unicity of click traces per site to be much lower than that of cross-domain tracking.

The results show that unicity does decrease slightly. Within single pages, when the location of the client is removed and only the category of the called page is retained, the unicity of longer click traces remains high (well above 20%), even when the temporal resolution is reduced to the order of hours (Fig. 6). Only limiting the trace length to a single click with timestamps on the order of minutes or hours, or to 2-click tuples with timestamps on the order of hours, pushes unicity below 10%.

An interesting artifact observed in Fig. 6 for configurations of very high granularity is that a decrease in maximum length can cause an increase in unicity. This is due to the way sessions are extracted from the measurement databases: longer unique click traces are split into several shorter unique traces, increasing overall unicity.

#### Anonymity Set Sizes
Unicity measures the fraction of pseudonyms in the database, while non-unique click traces fall into anonymity sets of varying sizes. For stable anonymization, large anonymity set sizes are desirable. Given the large number of over a million clients and the assumption that page popularity follows a power-law distribution, many common behaviors should be present in the database. Increased coarsening causes anonymity set sizes to increase linearly, even as unicity converges (Fig. 7).

#### Identifiability Experiments
Unicity provides a measure of the pseudonymity of click traces in a tracking database but does not indicate how easily a click trace can be identified or how much an adversary could gain by doing so. Our second research question aims to understand how easily tracking data can be linked against and re-identified with data from secondary sources.

##### User Data Exchanges
In the first scenario, we consider a tracker acquiring a second dataset with partial overlap of tracked sites with their own data. We want to understand the fraction of click traces in the second dataset that can be re-identified and uniquely matched to click traces in the first dataset, and the gain of the adversary. The results, shown in Figs. 8 and 9, confirm that identifiability increases progressively with growing overlap, eventually becoming equal to unicity once overlap reaches 100%.

##### Shoulder Surfing and Comparison to Digital Dossier Aggregation
Finally, we assess how easily data subjects can be linked back against their click traces in tracking databases. We assume an adversary possesses some identified page calls of a user, known from secondary sources such as social media. The results, shown in Figs. 10 and 11, indicate that the adversary needs to know the time of a single visit to an accuracy on the order of minutes to identify almost half of all browsing sessions with just two observations.

### Conclusion
The results of our experiments show that generalizing attributes does not yield anonymity as long as even a minimal amount of utility of the database is preserved. Limiting the length of click traces and coarsening timestamps can significantly reduce unicity, but truly low unicity values are only achieved under specific conditions. Further, the unicity of local tracking is lower than that of cross-domain tracking, and anonymity set sizes increase with increased coarsening. Finally, the identifiability of click traces in user data exchanges and through shoulder surfing highlights the need for robust anonymization techniques.
