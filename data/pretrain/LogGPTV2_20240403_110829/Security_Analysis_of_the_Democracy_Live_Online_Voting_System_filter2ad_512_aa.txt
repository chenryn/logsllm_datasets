**Abstract:**
Democracy Live’s OmniBallot platform is a web-based system designed for blank ballot delivery, ballot marking, and online voting. In early 2020, three states—Delaware, West Virginia, and New Jersey—announced that they would allow certain voters to cast votes online using OmniBallot. Despite the well-established risks associated with Internet voting, the system had not undergone a public, independent security review prior to our work.

We reverse-engineered the client-side portion of OmniBallot, as used in Delaware, to detail its operation and analyze its security. Our findings indicate that OmniBallot employs a simplistic approach to Internet voting, which is vulnerable to vote manipulation by malware on the voter’s device and by insiders or other attackers who can compromise Democracy Live, Amazon, Google, or Cloudflare. Additionally, Democracy Live, which previously lacked a privacy policy, receives sensitive personally identifiable information, including the voter’s identity, ballot selections, and browser fingerprint, which could be exploited for targeted political ads or disinformation campaigns. Even when OmniBallot is used to mark ballots that will be printed and returned by mail, the software transmits the voter’s identity and ballot choices to Democracy Live, posing an unnecessary risk to the secret ballot.

We recommend several changes to enhance the platform's safety for ballot delivery and marking. However, we conclude that using OmniBallot for electronic ballot return represents a severe risk to election security and could enable attackers to alter election results undetected. In response to our findings, Delaware and New Jersey halted their use of OmniBallot for online voting, but it remains available in other jurisdictions, along with similar tools that likely face the same serious risks.

## 1. Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has forced states to prepare for the possibility that voters may not be able to vote safely in person. Many jurisdictions are turning to forms of online ballot delivery and return to facilitate remote participation. One such tool is Democracy Live’s OmniBallot system, a web-based platform that can be used for blank ballot delivery, ballot marking, and online voting.

OmniBallot has long been used to allow voters to print ballots that will be returned through the mail. However, in early 2020, for the first time, three states announced plans for large classes of voters to use it to return their ballots online. New Jersey made the online voting option available to voters with disabilities, calling it “a pilot for if we need to use it more broadly in the future.” West Virginia allows both disabled and military voters, as well as overseas residents, to vote online using OmniBallot. Most significantly, Delaware offered OmniBallot online voting during the presidential primary to all voters who were sick or self-quarantining to avoid exposure to SARS-CoV-2, effectively covering most of the state.

While increasing voter access is a commendable goal, elections also face substantial risks from attackers, which are magnified when delivering or returning ballots online. Election officials must balance these risks with the access needs of their constituents.

For online voting, the consensus among election security experts and national security experts is that the risks are unacceptable. Numerous studies of Internet voting systems have uncovered critical security flaws. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine concluded that no known technology can guarantee the secrecy, security, and verifiability of a marked ballot transmitted over the Internet, and recommended against using the Internet for the return of marked ballots. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has also advised states to resist pushes for online voting, including for military voters. As recently as May 2020, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Election Assistance Commission, and National Institute of Standards and Technology warned states that electronic ballot return technologies are high-risk, even with controls in place, and that attacks could compromise ballot confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Despite these risks, OmniBallot had not previously been the subject of a public, independent security review, and there is little public documentation about its functionality. Democracy Live claims that the online ballot return capability should not be considered Internet voting but rather a “secure portal” or “document storage application,” which contradicts the definition used by security experts and the Election Assistance Commission. Similar ballot delivery and marking products from other vendors have also not been rigorously analyzed, making it difficult for voters, election officials, and policymakers to assess their safety.

In this paper, we present the first public, independent analysis of OmniBallot’s security and privacy. We obtained the portion of the software that runs in voters’ browsers, reverse-engineered it, and created a minimal compatible server to study the system’s design and operation. Using Delaware’s deployment as a model, we describe how the system functions, assess the risks of its various modes of operation, and offer a series of recommendations for the company and for election officials. Our key findings include:

1. **Simplistic Approach and Third-Party Dependencies:** OmniBallot’s electronic ballot return (online voting) function uses a simplistic approach that cannot achieve software independence or end-to-end verifiability, two key goals for secure Internet voting. It also relies extensively on third-party services and infrastructure, including Amazon’s cloud, and JavaScript from Google and Cloudflare. This makes votes returned online vulnerable to alteration, potentially without detection, by a wide range of parties, including Democracy Live itself, insiders at these tech firms, and attackers who gain access to any of the companies’ systems or to a voter’s client.

2. **Risk to Ballot Secrecy:** The OmniBallot online ballot marking mechanism, as used in Delaware, needlessly risks violating ballot secrecy by sending the voter’s identity and ballot selections to Democracy Live, even when the voter opts to print the ballot and return it physically through the mail. There is no technical reason for this information to be transmitted over the Internet, and some other jurisdictions have configured OmniBallot to mark the ballot client-side.

3. **Security and Privacy Risks in Blank Ballot Delivery:** Even when OmniBallot is used only for delivering blank ballots, there are important security and privacy risks, including the risk that ballots could be misdirected or subtly manipulated in ways that cause them to be counted incorrectly. These risks can be mitigated through careful election procedures, but officials need to ensure that the necessary protections are in place, including rigorous post-election audits.

4. **Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information:** In all modes of operation, Democracy Live receives a wealth of sensitive personally identifiable information, including voters’ names, addresses, dates of birth, physical locations, party affiliations, and partial social security numbers. When ballots are marked or returned online, the company also receives voters’ ballot selections and collects a browser fingerprint during online voting. This information is highly valuable for political purposes or for election interference, as it could be used to target ads or disinformation campaigns based on the voter’s fine-grained preferences. Prior to our work, OmniBallot had no privacy policy, and it is unclear whether there were any effective legal limitations on the company’s use of the data.

In this time of widespread social disruption, election officials face intense pressure to make remote voter participation easier and more accessible. However, as the use of online ballot delivery and return grows, so does the risk that a successful attack could change the result of a major election. We hope that our work will help states decide how to conduct upcoming elections in light of COVID-19 and that our analysis of OmniBallot can serve as a template for further security scrutiny of online ballot distribution and return products. Without greater technical transparency and analysis, voters and election officials will be unable to accurately weigh the trade-offs between risk and access.

## 2. A Tour of OmniBallot

Much of what is publicly known about OmniBallot comes from a few sources, including a FAQ provided by Democracy Live, information posted on various sites for jurisdictions’ deployments, and press statements by the company. In this section, we provide a more complete picture of the system’s operation and adoption based on our own examination of the software.

### 2.1 Modes of Operation

Each jurisdiction’s OmniBallot deployment is hosted at a unique URL. The platform is highly configurable, allowing jurisdictions to customize the available languages, accessibility options, voter lookup and authentication functions, and available features. Jurisdictions can configure the platform to provide any subset of the following three modes of operation:

- **Online Blank Ballot Delivery:** The voter downloads a blank ballot corresponding to their home address and/or party affiliation. The ballot is delivered as a PDF file. Most jurisdictions instruct voters to print it, mark it manually, and physically return it to the election authorities.
  
- **Online Ballot Marking:** Voters use the website to mark their ballot selections and download the completed ballot as a PDF file. Online marking makes it easier for voters with certain disabilities to fill out their ballots independently. It also allows the website to prevent overvotes and to warn voters about undervotes, reducing errors. The resulting PDF file can be printed and returned physically. Some jurisdictions, including Delaware, also give voters the option to return it via email or fax.
  
- **Online Ballot Return:** In some deployments, voters can use OmniBallot to mark their ballots and transmit them to the jurisdiction over the Internet through a service operated by Democracy Live. Jurisdictions print the ballots they receive and then tabulate them with other absentee ballots.

### 2.2 Deployments

Most instances of OmniBallot appear to be hosted at predictable paths of the form `https://sites.omniballot.us/n/app`, where `n` is the locality’s numeric FIPS code. Statewide deployments use two-digit numbers, and counties and cities use five-digit numbers. In May 2020, we visited all pages with these URL formats and found instances for seven state governments and 98 smaller jurisdictions in 11 states.

Nearly all OmniBallot customers offer online ballot delivery, and we found 70 that offer online ballot marking, but only a few allow online ballot return. We identified six jurisdictions that have the Internet voting option available:

- Jackson County, OR: `https://sites.omniballot.us/41029/app`
- Umatilla County, OR: `https://sites.omniballot.us/41059/app`
- Pierce County, WA: `https://sites.omniballot.us/53053/app`
- King Conservation District, WA: `https://sites.omniballot.us/kcd/app`
- State of West Virginia: `https://sites.omniballot.us/54/app`
- State of Delaware: `https://ballot.elections.delaware.gov/app`

New Jersey also announced plans to use Democracy Live for online voting and reportedly did use it for local school board elections in May 2020, but we were not able to locate a deployment for the state.

### 2.3 The Voter’s Perspective

We now describe how OmniBallot works from a voter’s perspective, using the Delaware deployment as a concrete example. Screenshots in Figure 1 illustrate each step.

1. **Welcome:** Voters visit the main URL of the website and are greeted by a welcome screen. The voter clicks a button to “Mark My Official Ballot.”

2. **Voter Lookup:** The voter enters their first and last name and birthdate, and the site locates them in the voter registration database. If multiple voters match, the site lists their street addresses and asks the voter to choose one.

3. **Verify Voter:** In Delaware, voters enter the last four digits of their social security numbers and a “ballot number” provided by the state in an email sent by the election administrators. These are verified by the server before the voter is allowed to proceed. Some other deployments do not use this verification step.

4. **Return Type:** Delaware lets voters opt to return their ballots by mail, by fax, by email (using a webmail portal), or through OmniBallot’s Internet voting mechanism (“electronic return”). If mail, fax, or email return is selected, voters can either mark their ballots using the site and generate PDF files to return or retrieve blank ballot PDFs and mark them manually.

5. **Ballot Marking:** The voter can scroll through the ballot and make selections. Write-in candidates can be entered using the keyboard where permitted. The site will refuse to mark more than the allowed number of candidates.

6. **Selection Review:** A summary screen shows the selections in each race (or a warning if the voter made fewer than the allowed number of selections). The voter can return to the ballot to change selections or proceed to casting.

7. **Signature:** Voters are instructed to sign their names with the mouse or touch screen, or to type their names. The result is captured as a bitmap image. Some other jurisdictions do not allow a typed signature and instruct voters that their signature must match the signature on file with the jurisdiction.

8. **Electronic Return:** Voters are shown a preview of their return packages (which includes their identification information and signature page) and their completed ballot. These are PDF files that the site renders with JavaScript.

9. **Ballot Submitted:** When voters are satisfied, they click a button to submit the ballot over the Internet. In Delaware, voters could check whether a ballot in their name has been accepted using their ballot numbers. However, there is no way to verify the integrity of the submitted ballot.
