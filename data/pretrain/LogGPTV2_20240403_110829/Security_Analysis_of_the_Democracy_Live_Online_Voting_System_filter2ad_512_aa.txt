Abstract
Democracy Live’s OmniBallot platform is a web-based
system for blank ballot delivery, ballot marking, and online
voting. In early 2020, three states—Delaware, West Virginia,
and New Jersey—announced that they would allow certain
voters to cast votes online using OmniBallot, but, despite the
well established risks of Internet voting, the system has never
before undergone a public, independent security review.
We reverse engineered the client-side portion of Omni-
Ballot, as used in Delaware, in order to detail the system’s
operation and analyze its security. We ﬁnd that OmniBallot
uses a simplistic approach to Internet voting that is vulnerable
to vote manipulation by malware on the voter’s device and by
insiders or other attackers who can compromise Democracy
Live, Amazon, Google, or Cloudﬂare. In addition, Democracy
Live, which had no privacy policy prior to our work, receives
sensitive personally identiﬁable information—including the
voter’s identity, ballot selections, and browser ﬁngerprint—
that could be used to target political ads or disinformation
campaigns. Even when OmniBallot is used to mark ballots
that will be printed and returned in the mail, the software
sends the voter’s identity and ballot choices to Democracy
Live, an unnecessary risk that jeopardizes the secret ballot.
We recommend changes to make the platform safer for
ballot delivery and marking. However, we conclude that using
OmniBallot for electronic ballot return represents a severe
risk to election security and could allow attackers to alter
election results without detection. In response to our ﬁndings,
Delaware and New Jersey halted their use of OmniBallot for
online voting, but it remains available in other jurisdictions,
as do similar tools that likely face the same serious risks.
1 Introduction
COVID-19 has forced states to prepare for the possibility that
voters may not be able to vote safely in person in coming elec-
tions, and many jurisdictions are turning to forms of online
ballot delivery and return to facilitate remote participation.
One avenue for doing so is Democracy Live’s OmniBallot
system, a web-based platform that can be used for blank ballot
delivery, ballot marking, and online voting.
OmniBallot has long been used to let voters print ballots
that will be returned through the mail, but in early 2020, for
the ﬁrst time, three states announced plans for large classes
of voters to use it to return their ballots online. New Jersey
recently made the online voting option available to voters
with disabilities, calling the move “a pilot for if we need to
use it more broadly in the future” [27]. West Virginia allows
not only the disabled but also military voters and residents
overseas to vote online using OmniBallot [39]. Most sig-
niﬁcantly, Delaware [24] offered OmniBallot online voting
during the presidential primary to all voters who were sick or
were self-quarantining or social distancing to avoid exposure
to SARS-CoV-2—practically the entire state [11, 24].
Increasing voter access is a laudable goal. Voters who are
sick, disabled, or stationed overseas sometimes face substan-
tial obstacles to participation, and the coronavirus pandemic
threatens to disrupt in-person voting for everyone. However,
elections also face substantial risks from attackers—risks that
are magniﬁed when delivering or returning ballot online. Elec-
tion ofﬁcials have the complicated job of weighing these risks
in light of the access needs of their constituencies.
For online voting, the consensus of election security experts
and national security experts is that the risks are unacceptable.
Numerous studies of Internet voting systems used or slated
for use in real elections have uncovered critical security ﬂaws
(e.g., [26, 29, 31, 51, 52, 65]). The National Academies of Sci-
ences, Engineering, and Medicine concluded that “no known
technology guarantees the secrecy, security, and veriﬁability
of a marked ballot transmitted over the Internet,” and that,
“[a]t the present time, the Internet (or any network connected
to the Internet) should not be used for the return of marked
ballots” [41]. In light of Russia’s attacks on U.S. election
infrastructure during the 2016 presidential election, the Sen-
ate Select Committee on Intelligence has recommended that
“[s]tates should resist pushes for online voting,” including for
military voters [61]. As recently as May 2020, the Cyberse-
USENIX Association
30th USENIX Security Symposium    3077
curity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Federal Bureau of
Investigation, U.S. Election Assistance Commission, and Na-
tional Institute of Standards and Technology privately warned
states that “electronic ballot return technologies are high-risk
even with [risk-mitigation] controls in place,” and that attacks
“could be conducted from anywhere in world, at high volumes,
and could compromise ballot conﬁdentiality, ballot integrity,
and/or stop ballot availability” [63].
Despite these risks, OmniBallot has not previously been the
subject of a public, independent security review,1 and there
is little public documentation about its functionality. Democ-
racy Live even claims that the online ballot return capability
should not be considered Internet voting at all, but rather a
“secure portal” or “document storage application” [45]. (In
fact, it completely matches the deﬁnition of Internet voting as
used by security experts [1] and by the Election Assistance
Commission [59].) Nor have similar ballot delivery and mark-
ing products from other vendors been rigorously analyzed.
This makes it difﬁcult for voters, election ofﬁcials, and other
policymakers to understand whether the technologies are safe.
In this paper, we present the ﬁrst public, independent analy-
sis of OmniBallot’s security and privacy. We obtained the por-
tion of the software that runs in voters’ browsers, reverse en-
gineered it, and created a minimal compatible server in order
to study the system’s design and operation. Using Delaware’s
deployment as a model, we describe how the system functions,
assess the risks of its various modes of operation, and offer a
series of recommendations for the company and for election
ofﬁcials. The analysis was current as of June 7, 2020 and may
not reﬂect later system changes. Our key ﬁndings include:
1. OmniBallot’s electronic ballot return (online voting)
function uses a simplistic approach that cannot achieve
software independence [46] or end-to-end veriﬁabil-
ity [9], two key goals for secure Internet voting. It also
makes extensive use of third-party services and infras-
tructure: the servers and voter data are hosted in Ama-
zon’s cloud, and the client executes JavaScript from both
Google and Cloudﬂare. As a result, votes returned on-
line can be altered, potentially without detection, by a
wide range of parties, including Democracy Live itself,
insiders at any of these three large tech ﬁrms, and attack-
ers who gain access to any of the companies’ systems or
to a voter’s client.
2. The OmniBallot online ballot marking mechanism as
used in Delaware needlessly risks violating ballot se-
crecy by sending the voter’s identity and ballot selec-
tions to Democracy Live, even when the voter opts to
print the ballot and return it physically through the mail.
1Democracy Live claims that audits have been conducted by the National
Cybersecurity Center (a private entity) [43] and ShiftState Security [15],
though only high-level summaries of these audits appear to be public. NCC
and ShiftState were also claimed to have performed audits of the online
voting app Voatz [40], which was later found to have basic, severe security
failings [51, 55].
There is no technical reason why this information needs
to be transmitted over the Internet, and some other juris-
dictions have conﬁgured OmniBallot to mark the ballot
client-side.
3. There are important security and privacy risks even when
OmniBallot is used only for delivering blank ballots, in-
cluding the risk that ballots could be misdirected or sub-
tly manipulated in ways that cause them to be counted in-
correctly. Although these risks can be mitigated through
careful election procedures, ofﬁcials need to ensure that
the necessary protections are in place, including rigorous
post-election audits.
4. In all modes of operation, Democracy Live receives a
wealth of sensitive personally identiﬁable information:
voters’ names, addresses, dates of birth, physical loca-
tions, party afﬁliations, and partial social security num-
bers. When ballots are marked or returned online, the
company also receives voters’ ballot selections, and it
collects a browser ﬁngerprint during online voting. This
information would be highly valuable for political pur-
poses or for election interference, as it could be used
to target ads or disinformation campaigns based on the
voter’s ﬁne-grained preferences. Nevertheless, Omni-
Ballot had no privacy policy prior to our work, and it is
unclear whether there were any effective legal limitations
on the company’s use of the data.
In this time of widespread social disruption, election ofﬁ-
cials face intense pressure to make remote voter participation
easier and available to more people, but as use of online ballot
delivery and return grows, so will the risk that a successful
attack could change the result of a major election. We hope
that our work will be helpful for states deciding how to
conduct upcoming elections in light of COVID-19, and that
our analysis of OmniBallot can serve as a template for further
security scrutiny of online ballot distribution and return prod-
ucts more generally. Without greater technical transparency
and analysis, voters and election ofﬁcials will be unable to
accurately weigh the tradeoffs between risk and access.
2 A Tour of OmniBallot
Much of what is publicly known about OmniBallot comes
from a small number of sources, including a FAQ provided by
Democracy Live [16], information posted on various sites for
jurisdictions’ deployments (e.g., [15]), and press statements
by the company. In this section, we provide a more complete
picture of the system’s operation and adoption, based on our
own examination of the software.
2.1 Modes of Operation
Each jurisdiction’s OmniBallot deployment takes the form
of a website at a unique URL. The platform is highly con-
3078    30th USENIX Security Symposium
USENIX Association
ﬁgurable, and jurisdictions can customize the available lan-
guages, accessibility options, voter lookup and authentication
functions, and available features. Most importantly, jurisdic-
tions can conﬁgure the platform to provide any subset of the
three modes of operation listed below:
Online blank ballot delivery. The voter downloads a blank
ballot corresponding to their home address and/or party
afﬁliation. The ballot is delivered as a PDF ﬁle. Most
jurisdictions instruct voters to print it, mark it manually,
and physically return it to the election authorities.
Online ballot marking. Voters use the website to mark their
ballot selections and download the completed ballot as a
PDF ﬁle. Online marking makes it easier for voters with
certain disabilities to ﬁll out their ballots independently.
It also allows the website to prevent overvotes and to
warn voters about undervotes, reducing errors. The re-
sulting PDF ﬁle can be printed and returned physically.
Some jurisdictions, including Delaware, also give voters
the option to return it via email or fax.
Online ballot return. In some deployments, voters can use
OmniBallot to mark their ballots and transmit them to
the jurisdiction over the Internet through a service op-
erated by Democracy Live. Like in Washington, D.C.’s
attempted Internet voting system [65], jurisdictions print
the ballots they receive and then tabulate them with other
absentee ballots.
2.2 Deployments
Most instances of OmniBallot appear to be hosted at pre-
dictable paths of the form https://sites.omniballot.us/n/app,
where n is the locality’s numeric FIPS code [57]. Statewide
deployments use two-digit numbers, and counties and cites
use ﬁve-digit numbers. We visited all pages with these URL
formats in May 2020 and found instances for seven state
governments and 98 smaller jurisdictions in 11 states.
Nearly all OmniBallot customers offer online ballot deliv-
ery, and we found 70 that offer online ballot marking, but
only a few appear to allow online ballot return. We found six
jurisdictions that have the Internet voting option available:
• Jackson County, OR
https://sites.omniballot.us/41029/app
• Umatilla County, OR
https://sites.omniballot.us/41059/app
• Pierce County, WA
https://sites.omniballot.us/53053/app
• King Conservation District, WA
https://sites.omniballot.us/kcd/app
• State of West Virginia
https://sites.omniballot.us/54/app
• State of Delaware
https://ballot.elections.delaware.gov/app
New Jersey also announced plans to use Democracy Live
for online voting [38, 53] and reportedly did use it for local
school board elections in May 2020, but we were not able to
locate a deployment for the state.
2.3 The Voter’s Perspective
We now describe how OmniBallot works from a voter’s per-
spective. Screenshots in Figure 1 illustrate each step. We use
the Delaware deployment as a concrete example, noting some
of the differences in other deployments where applicable.
1. Welcome. Voters visit the main URL of the website and
are greeted by a welcome screen. The voter clicks a
button to “Mark My Ofﬁcial Ballot.”
2. Voter lookup. The voter enters their ﬁrst and last name
and birthdate, and the site locates them in the voter reg-
istration database. If multiple voters match, the site lists
their street addresses and asks the voter to choose one.
3. Verify voter. In Delaware, voters entered the last four
digits of their social security numbers and a “ballot num-
ber” provided by the state in an email sent by the election
administrators. These were veriﬁed by the server before
the voter is allowed to proceed. Some other deployments
we examined did not use this veriﬁcation step.
4. Return type. Delaware let voters opt to return their bal-
lots by mail, by fax, by email (using a webmail portal), or
through OmniBallot’s Internet voting mechanism (“elec-
tronic return”). If mail, fax, or email return was selected,
voters could either mark their ballots using the site and
generate PDF ﬁles to return or retrieve blank ballot PDFs
and mark them manually.
5. Ballot marking. The voter can scroll through the ballot
and make selections. Write-in candidates can be entered
using the keyboard where permitted. The site will refuse
to mark more than the allowed number of candidates.
6. Selection review. A summary screen shows the selec-
tions in each race (or a warning if the voter made fewer
than the allowed number of sections). The voter can
return to the ballot to change selections or proceed to
casting.
7. Signature. Voters are instructed to sign their names with
the mouse or touch screen, or to type their names. The
result is captured as a bitmap image. Some other jurisdic-
tions do not allow a typed signature and instruct voters
that their signature must match the signature on ﬁle with
the jurisdiction.2
2On-screen signatures often differ dramatically from signatures made on
paper [20].

8. Electronic return. Voters are shown a preview of their
return packages (which includes their identiﬁcation in-
formation and signature page) and their completed ballot.
These are PDF ﬁles that the site renders with JavaScript.
9. Ballot submitted. When voters are satisﬁed, they click a
button to submit the ballot over the Internet. In Delaware,
voters could check whether a ballot in their name has
been accepted using their ballot numbers. However, un-
