Challenge Waypoint: Target the Children of an Element Using jQuery has an
issue.  
User Agent is: `Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:41.0)
Gecko/20100101 Firefox/41.0`.
My code:
      jQuery Playground
          #left-well
            #target1
            #target2
            #target3
          #right-well
            #target4
            #target5
            #target6
I am using FF 41 on Linux Mint. When I run the tests via CTRL+Enter, I get the
following screen shot. As you can see, the text for the buttons is green on
the right well. The code addition I have is
    $("#left-well").children().css("color", "blue");

This has happened on many challenges so far today, but not every time.
