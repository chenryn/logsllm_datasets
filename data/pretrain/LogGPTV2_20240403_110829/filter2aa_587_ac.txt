### Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has participated in a total of 1,341 cases (as of this data collection), with only one case in which she did not participate: *Federal Election Commission v. NRA Political Victory Fund, 513 U.S. 88 (1994)*. She has spoken at least once in every argument in which she has participated. Over the cases included in this analysis, she voted for the petitioner 431 times (57.8%) and for the respondent 315 times (42.2%). This pattern aligns closely with the court's overall tendency to slightly favor the petitioner (see the “Case Outcomes” discussion in the “Court as a Whole” section below).

Justice Ginsburg has asked a total of 10,501 questions, with 5,382 (51.2%) directed at the petitioner, 4,818 (45.8%) at the respondent, and 301 (2.9%) at her colleagues on the court. Generally, she is an even-handed questioner, but when she votes for the respondent, she tends to direct more questions to the petitioner.

#### Questioning Patterns by Vote
This indicator is not entirely reliable. There are 76 cases in which she asked no questions of the respondent, yet still voted for the petitioner 40 times, including seven cases where she asked more than 10 questions of the petitioner. When the ratio of petitioner questions to respondent questions is greater than 5-1, she has voted for the petitioner only 23.7% of the time.

In general, it is difficult to infer Justice Ginsburg’s vote based on her questioning at oral arguments. However, as the ratio of the number of questions she asks of the petitioner to the number of questions she asks of the respondent increases, the probability of her voting for the petitioner decreases, settling just below 25% for extreme values.

### Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.

**Scorecard**
- Cases During Tenure: 304
- Voted with the Majority: 238
- Voted with the Minority: 37
- Did Not Participate: 21
- Majority Opinions Authored: 29
- Concurrences Authored: 31
- Dissents Authored: 33
- Joined Another Justice’s Opinion: 33

**Discussion**
Of the 207 oral arguments eligible for inclusion in this study, Justice Alito voted with the petitioner 114 times (55%). Overall, he has voted with the majority 78% of the time, positioning him as a centrist. He spoke at oral argument 1,295 times, averaging six questions per case.

Like Justice Scalia, Justice Alito’s allocation of questions between the petitioner and respondent is almost a mirror image, depending on which party he eventually votes for, with the party receiving his vote being asked fewer questions.

#### Questioning Patterns by Vote
- In cases where Justice Alito voted for the petitioner, 39.5% of his questions went to the petitioner, 58.5% to the respondent, and 2% to his fellow justices.
- In cases where he voted for the respondent, 59.5% of his questions went to the petitioner, 37.4% to the respondent, and 3.1% to his fellow justices.

This indicator is less reliable for Justice Alito, especially for votes for the respondent. In cases where he asked more questions of the petitioner, he still voted for the petitioner 43.7% of the time. Conversely, in cases where he asked more questions of the respondent, he voted for the respondent 35.1% of the time.

### Justice Sonia Sotomayor

**Scorecard**
- Cases During Tenure: 103
- Voted with the Majority: 78
- Voted with the Minority: 18
- Did Not Participate: 3
- Majority Opinions Authored: 12
- Concurrences Authored: 8
- Dissents Authored: 13
- Joined Another Justice’s Opinion: 24

**Discussion**
Only 85 cases from Justice Sotomayor’s tenure were eligible for this study. In those cases, she voted for the petitioner 52 times (61.2%) and for the respondent 33 times (38.8%). Similar to Justice Ginsburg, she tends to ask more questions of the petitioner in cases where she votes for the respondent.

#### Questioning Patterns by Vote
Unlike Justice Ginsburg, there is no clear trend in Justice Sotomayor’s questioning. In five cases where she asked the petitioner 15 or more questions and the respondent zero, she voted for the petitioner three times. In 21 cases where she asked the petitioner more than 10 questions, she voted with the petitioner nine times (42.8%). In cases where she asks more than 20 questions of the petitioner, it is likely that she will vote for the respondent. For example, in *Wood v. Allen, 558 U.S. ___(2010)*, Justice Sotomayor asked no questions of the petitioner, spoke 22 times during the respondent’s argument, and still voted for the respondent.

### Justice Stephen G. Breyer

**Scorecard**
- Cases During Tenure: 1237
- Voted with the Majority: 972
- Voted with the Minority: 247
- Did Not Participate: 16
- Majority Opinions Authored: 124
- Concurrences Authored: 150
- Dissents Authored: 235
- Joined Another Justice’s Opinion: 230

**Discussion**
This analysis covered 716 of the 1237 cases heard by the Supreme Court during Justice Breyer’s tenure. He has spoken a total of 12,892 times, averaging 18 questions per case. Justice Breyer has voted with the majority in 78.6% of the cases in which he has participated.

At oral argument, Justice Breyer’s distribution of questions is unique: 57.7% of his questions are directed at the respondent, and 39.0% at the petitioner, despite voting for the petitioner in 64.9% of the cases. His questioning is less respondent-centric in cases where he votes for the respondent.

#### Questioning Patterns by Vote
Justice Breyer’s high percentage of questions directed at the respondent, regardless of his eventual vote, is unique. In cases where he voted for the respondent, 49.7% of his questions were directed at the petitioner. In the 435 cases where he asked more questions of the respondent, he voted for the petitioner 76.3% of the time. In the 246 cases where he asked more questions of the petitioner, he voted for the respondent 52.8% of the time. Thus, while it is more likely that Justice Breyer will vote for the petitioner, this probability increases the more questions he asks of the respondent.

### The Court as a Whole

Understanding the patterns of individual justices is more helpful when placed in the context of the court’s overall behavior. Being “in the majority” varies from case to case, depending on the split of the court’s votes. Knowing a justice’s tendency to vote in favor of the petitioner is more informative when compared to the court’s collective tendency.

#### Case Outcomes
The court shows a slight bias in favor of petitioners, with petitioners prevailing in roughly 57% of the cases analyzed. This is likely because litigants would not appeal to the Supreme Court if they reasonably expected to lose. Potential litigants might also choose not to bring suit or to settle, rather than risk an unfavorable ruling.

#### Decisional Patterns
Over the course of 2,371 cases, the court has produced 18 different decisional patterns, ranging from 9-0 to 3-3. Only eight patterns amounted to more than 2% of the total caseload. The distribution of decisional splits remains relatively consistent year by year, with some fluctuations in the frequencies of 5-4 and 7-2 splits.

### Concluding Thoughts

This analysis, while interesting, is somewhat superficial. Further investigation could explore:
- Whether runs of multiple consecutive questions correlate with specific outcomes for any of the justices.
- If there is a correlation between the justices’ votes and specific decisional split patterns.
- Whether a justice’s silence at oral argument signals anything about their probable vote.
- If certain justices tend to engage in dialogue with one another, and if so, whether this correlates with their voting patterns.

The answers to these questions lie within the collected data, but answering them would be complex. Even with a relatively simple investigation, we can identify several justices whose behavior at oral argument may reveal something about how they are likely to vote. Justices Breyer, Alito, Ginsburg, and Scalia exhibit questioning patterns that correlate with their votes, while Justice Roberts does so to a weaker extent. Justice Sotomayor may also show such patterns as she develops a deeper history with the court. Justice Kagan has not been observed enough to determine predictability. Justices Thomas and Kennedy do not appear to leak information about their leanings at oral argument.

While traditional legal analysis techniques remain the dominant strategy for predicting Supreme Court outcomes, incorporating additional tools can provide support for proposed outcomes. These techniques may be of limited utility to advocates but could be helpful to corporate litigants who need to prepare for potential rulings. They are primarily of interest to court-watchers and handicappers.

To make a more nuanced estimation of the court’s vote in a given case, one should first count the “sure” votes using traditional policy-based reasoning. Next, tally the questions asked at oral argument and check if the patterns exhibited by the justices undermine the certainty of their vote. Finally, use the question tally to predict the probability of the remaining justices' votes, factoring in their degree of petitioner-bias. This approach can help estimate the odds of the ultimate outcome.
