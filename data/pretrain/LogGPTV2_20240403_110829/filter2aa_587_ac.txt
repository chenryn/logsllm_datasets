Justice Ginsburg has been on the court for a total of 1,341 cases (as of this data 
collection), in that entire time, there has only been one case in which she did not participate,17 
and she has spoken at least once in every single argument in which she has participated. Over

the cases included in this analysis, she voted for the petitioner 431 times (57.8%), and for the 
respondent 315 times (42.2%). This pattern places her more or less precisely in harmony  with 
the court’s overall tendency to side slightly with the petitioner (see the “Case Outcomes” 
discussion in the “Court as a Whole” section, below).
Justice Ginsburg has asked a total of 10,501 questions, of which 5,382 (51.2%) 
were for the petitioner, 4,818 (45.8%) were for the respondent, and 301 (2.9%) were for a 
colleague on the court. On the whole, she is an even-handed questioner, but when she votes for 
the respondent, she has a tendency to pepper the petitioner with questions.
Questioning Patterns by Vote
This is not a wholly trustworthy indicator, however: there are 76 cases in which she asked no 
questions whatsoever of the respondent, but in those cases she still cast her vote for the 
petitioner 40 times (including seven cases in which she asked more than 10 questions of the 
petitioner). Still, if we calculate the ration of petitioner questions to respondent questions for 
each case, when the ratio is greater than 5-1, she has voted for the petitioner only 23.7% of the 
time. 
As a general rule, it seems impossible to infer much about Justice Ginsburg’s vote 
on the basis of her speaking at oral argument. However, as the ratio of the number of questions 
Justice Ginsburg asks of the petitioner at oral argument to the number of questions she asks of

the respondent increases, the probability of her voting for the petitioner decreases, settling 
just below 25% for extreme values.

Discussion
Of the 207 oral arguments eligible for inclusion in this study, Justice Alito voted 
with the petitioner 114 times (55%), and in his time on the court overall, he has voted with the 
majority 78% of the time, making him a centrist, in terms of the court’s overall tendency to side 
slightly in favor of the petitioner. He spoke at oral argument 1,295 times (an average of six 
questions per case). 
Like Justice Scalia, the pattern of Justice Alito’s allocation of questions between 
the petitioner and respondent is an almost perfect mirror image, depending on which party he 
eventually votes for, with the party that receives his vote being asked fewer questions.
Questioning Patterns by Vote
-17-
Thus, in cases where Justice Alito voted for the petitioner, the 39.5% of his questions went to 
the petitioner, 58.5% to the respondent, and the remaining 2% to his fellow justices. In cases 
where the respondent got Justice Alito’s vote, 59.5% of his questions went to the petitioner, 
37.4% to the respondent, and the remaining 3.1% to his fellow justices. This is a less reliable 
indicator for Justice Alito than it is for Justice Scalia, at least when votes for the respondent are 
concerned. In cases where Justice Alito asked more questions of the petitioner, he still voted for 
the petitioner 43.7% of the time; in cases where Justice Alito asked more questions of the 
respondent, on the other hand, he only voted for the respondent 35.1% of the time.

Only 85 cases from Justice Sotomayor’s tenure on the court were eligible for 
inclusion in this study. In those cases, she voted for the petitioner 52 times (61.2%), and for the 
respondent 33 times (38.8%). As was the case with Justice Ginsburg, Justice Sotomayor tends to 
ask more questions of the petitioner in cases where she votes for the respondent.
-18-
Questioning Patterns by Vote
In contrast to Justice Ginsburg, however, there is no clear trend. Justice Sotomayor is liable to 
vote either way, regardless of the ratio of petitioner questions to respondent questions. In the 
five cases where she asked the petitioner 15 or more questions and the respondent zero, she 
voted for the petitioner three times. In the 21 cases where she asked the petitioner more than 
10 questions, she voted with the petitioner nine times (or 42.8%). Possibly some more useful 
pattern will emerge over time, but at the moment, the best we can say is that in cases where 
she asks more than 20 questions of the petitioner, it is likely that Justice Sotomayor will vote 
for the respondent.  The converse is not necessarily true: in Wood v. Allen, 558 U.S. ___(2010), 
Justice Sotomayor asked no questions of the petitioner, but spoke 22 times during the 
respondent’s argument and still voted for the respondent.

Discussion
This analysis covered 716 of the 1237 cases heard by the Supreme Court during 
Justice Breyer’s tenure. In those cases, he has spoken a total of 12,892 times, for an average of 
18 questions per case. Justice Breyer has voted with the majority in 78.6% of the cases in which 
he has participated.
At oral argument, Justice Breyer’s distribution of questions is unique: 57.7% of 
his questions are directed at the respondent, and a mere 39.0% at the petitioner, despite the 
fact that he has voted for the petitioner in 64.9% of the cases available to this study. 
Nevertheless, his questioning is far less respondent-centric in cases where he votes for the 
respondent.
Questioning Patterns by Vote
Justice Breyer’s tendency to devote such a high percentage of his questions to the respondent, 
-20-
regardless of his eventual vote, is unique among the pool of justices for whom there was 
enough data to study. In cases where he has voted for the respondent, just under half of his 
questions have been directed at the petitioner (49.7%). In the 435 cases where Justice Breyer 
has asked more questions of the respondent, he has voted for the petitioner 76.3% of the time, 
whereas in the 246 cases in which he asked more questions of the petitioner, he voted for the 
respondent 52.8% of the time. Thus, from a purely statistical perspective, although it is more 
likely that Justice Breyer will vote for the petitioner in any given case, that probability 
increases, the more questions he asks of the respondent.
The Court As a Whole
Knowledge of the patterns of the justices individually is more helpful when it is 
couched in the context of the behavior of the court as a whole. Being “in the majority” differs 
from case to case, for example, depending on whether, and how, the court’s votes are split. 
Likewise, knowing the tendency of a given justice to vote in favor of the petitioner is more 
helpful when compared to the court’s tendency as a collective. 
Case Outcomes
As has been mentioned, the court shows a slight bias in favor of petitioners: 
petitioners prevailed in roughly 57% of the cases analyzed, as depicted in the figure below.
Cases Resolved in Favor of Petitioner vs. Cases Resolved in Favor of Respondent
This is most likely explained by the fact that litigants would not appeal to the Supreme Court if 
-21-
they would reasonably expect to lose. Correspondingly, potential litigants might elect not to 
bring suit at all (or to settle, if they find themselves sued), rather than run the risk that the 
court might issue a rule that hamstrings their cause for all time.
Decisional Patterns
Over the course of the 2,371 cases studied here, the court has come out with 18 
different decisional patterns, ranging from 9-0 to 3-3.18 Of these, only eight patterns amounted 
to more than 2% of the total caseload.
Distribution of Decisional Splits
The distribution of decisional splits remains relatively consistent on a year-by-year basis; there 
are some fluctuations in the relative frequencies of 5-4 and 7-2 splits, but the pattern is 
maintained roughly over time

The column for 2008 should be disregarded because, as mentioned above, Oyez did only a 
spotty job at recording case outcomes for that year: the information available appears to be 
correct, but it is incomplete. Other than that column, the only serious anomalies are the 
sudden surges of 8-1 decisions in 1987 and 2010. The 2010 group is explained by Justice Kagan’s 
high frequency of recusal, and the fact that not all of the court’s 2010 decisions have yet been 
published. In 1987, Justice Kennedy was new to the court, and did not participate in a similar 
series of decisions. There do not, in other words, appear to be many significant trends either in 
the harmony or the divisiveness of the court, and unanimous decisions are fairly consistently 
at least 30% of the court’s output.
Concluding Thoughts
The analysis presented here is interesting, but somewhat superficial– it would be 
technically feasible to dig much deeper. Potentially fruitful topics for further investigation 
include:
•
Are runs of multiple consecutive questions correlated with specific 
outcomes for any of the justices?
•
Is there a correlation between any of the justices’ votes and specific 
decisional split patterns (are there, for example, signs in the oral 
-23-
argument questioning patterns that point to whether or not a case will be 
decided unanimously)?
•
Except for Justice Thomas, does a justice’s silence at oral argument signal 
anything about his or her probable vote?
•
Do certain justices tend to engage in dialog with one another, and if so, 
does that correlate with any particular pattern in their voting?
The answers to all these questions lie within the data already collected,19 but answering them 
would be complex. As it stands, even having done only relatively simple investigation, we are 
able to spot several justices whose behavior at oral argument may reveal something about how 
they are likely to vote. Specifically, Justices Breyer, Alito, Ginsburg, and Scalia all exhibit 
questioning patterns that correlate with their votes; Justice Roberts does as well, but to a 
weaker extent. Possibly the same will be true of Justice Sotomayor, as she develops a deeper 
history with the court. There has not been enough chance to observe Justice Kagan in action to 
say whether she will be at all predictable via this method. The only two justices who appear not 
to leak information about their leanings at oral argument are Justice Thomas, who remains 
silent, and Justice Kennedy, whose questioning pattern is largely inscrutable.
Of course, in many instances, it may be obvious how a given justice may vote, 
based on the justice’s record, or the nature of the questions asked at oral argument. This 
research has never set out to supplant standard legal analysis techniques. Reasonable minds 
differ on how the court will find in any given case, and the goal of this research is to see if by 
relying on tools outside of the usual lawyer’s arsenal, we can provide additional support for a 
proposed outcome.
These techniques are presumably of limited utility to advocates: in the heat of 
19 Others, such as the question of whether any of the justices behave differently at oral argument in civil cases 
than they do in criminal cases, or whether certain justices tend to treat cases from specific circuits differently 
would require the collection of additional data.

oral argument, it’s unlikely that there is anything to be gained by counting questions. They 
may be of some help to corporate litigants, however, who could take steps to insulate 
themselves from the effects of a forthcoming decision in the time after oral argument, if they 
had better insight into what that ruling might be. Most likely, these tools will be of interest to 
primarily to court-watchers and handicappers.
In making a more nuanced estimation of the court’s vote in a given case, the first 
step is to count any “sure” votes, using traditional policy-based reasoning. Next, one would 
tally up the questions asked at oral argument, and check to see if patterns exhibited by the 
justices already counted undermined the certainty of their vote. If so, discount the certainty of 
their vote by some percentage. Finally, if any of the remaining justices are among those known 
to hint at their votes by their behavior at oral argument, use the question tally to predict the 
probability of their votes, remembering to factor in their degree of petitioner-bias. At this 
point, enough justices should have probabilities assigned to them that it is possible to estimate 
the odds of the ultimate outcome.
The dominant strategy for predicting Supreme Court outcomes relies, 
understandably, on traditional expertise about the court and the cases in question. Other 
strategies exist. The “Fantasy SCOTUS” league,20 for example, endeavors to harness the 
collective thoughts of its various players. Prediction based on historical data is another valid 
source of input, and if our goal, in the end, is to make more accurate predictions about future 
cases, we should be open to incorporating whatever tools can help us accomplish this. This 
paper demonstrates the feasibility of providing support for inferences about case outcomes 
from oral argument data using homegrown information collection and analysis tools.21
