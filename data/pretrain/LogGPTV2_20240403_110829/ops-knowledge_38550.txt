Question: Alice and Bob are setting up a secure communication using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol. They have agreed on the public parameters p and g, where p is a large prime and g is a generator. Alice chooses a secret value a and computes A=g^a mod p, which she sends to Bob. Bob chooses his secret value b and sends back B=g^b mod p. How should Alice and Bob proceed to ensure both end up with the same shared secret key?
"A": "Alice computes K=B^a mod p, and Bob computes K=A^b mod p, resulting in the same shared secret key K.",
"B": "Alice and Bob exchange their secret values a and b, then individually compute K=g^ab mod p.",
"C": "Alice computes K=A^b mod p, and Bob computes K=B^a mod p, and they use these different keys for encryption and decryption respectively.",
"D": "Alice and Bob publicly announce the computed values A and B, and an external trusted third party calculates K=g^(ab) mod p and sends it to both."
Answer: A
