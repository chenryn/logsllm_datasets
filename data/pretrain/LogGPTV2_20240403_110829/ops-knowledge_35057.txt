User: Please write a Python script to batch rename files on the server, support regular expressions and rename according to specified rules.
Assistant: The following is a simple Python script that can rename files on the server in batches: ```python import os import re # Set the file path and rules to be renamed path = '/path/to/files' pattern = r' old_name(\d+)\.txt' replace = r'new_name\1.txt' # traverse folders, match filenames and rename for filename in os.listdir(path): old_filepath = os.path.join(path, filename ) if os.path.isfile(old_filepath): # Regular expression matching filename match = re.search(pattern, filename) if match: # Construct a new filename new_filename = re.sub(pattern, replace, filename) new_filepath = os.path.join(path, new_filename) # Rename the file os.rename(old_filepath, new_filepath) ``` In the above example, we first set the file path to be renamed and the filename to be used to match and replace Regular expressions and renaming rules for . Next, we iterate over all the files in the folder using the os.listdir function from Python's os module, and construct the file path using the os.path.join function. Then, we use the re.search function in Python's re module to perform regular expression matching on the file name. If the match is successful, we use the re.sub function to replace the original file name, and use the os.rename function to rename the file. Finally, we can save the above code as a Python script that can be run to batch rename files.
