Abstract—Physical layer message integrity protection and authentication by countering signal-cancellation has been shown as a
promising alternative to traditional pure cryptographic message authentication protocols, due to the non-necessity of neither
pre-shared secrets nor secure channels. However, the security of such an approach remained an open problem due to the lack of
systematic security modeling and quantitative analysis. In this paper, we ﬁrst establish a novel signal cancellation attack framework to
study the optimal signal-cancellation attacker’s behavior and utility using game-theory, which precisely captures the attacker’s
knowledge using its correlated channel estimates in various channel environments as well as the online nature of the attack. Based on
theoretical results, we propose a practical channel randomization approach to defend against signal cancellation attack, which exploits
state diversity and swift reconﬁgurability of reconﬁgurable antenna to increase randomness and meanwhile reduce correlation of
channel state information. We show that by proactively mimicking the attacker and placing restrictions on the attacker’s location, we
can bound the attacker’s knowledge of channel state information, thereby achieve a guaranteed level of message integrity protection in
practice. Besides, we conduct extensive experiments and simulations to show the security and performance of the proposed approach.
We believe our novel threat modeling and quantitative security analysis methodology can beneﬁt a wide range of physical layer security
problems.

1 INTRODUCTION
M ESSAGE integrity protection and authentication are
two fundamental security services in the Internet-of-
Things, given the exponential growth of wireless sensors
and mobile devices [2]. Traditionally, such services have
assumed the existence of pre-shared secret keys or secure
channels. However, in many scenarios these premises may
not be satisﬁed, e.g. when initial security associations need
to be established among two or more constrained wireless
devices. Generally, secret keys need to be distributed ei-
ther via an ofﬂine secure channel or using a public key
infrastructure (PKI). But key pre-distribution may not be
always feasible due to the lack of hardware interfaces and
the absence of a global PKI. Some existing research proposed
using out-of-band (OOB) secure auxiliary channels to build

message authentication protocols without pre-shared keys
[3]–[8]. However, an OOB channel would require special
hardware and non-trivial human interaction, while its se-
curity has been revisited [9]. In addition, whenever keys
are stolen or compromised, re-keying involves signiﬁcant
human effort as well.
Ideally, we want to provide message integrity protec-
tion and authentication without relying on pre-shared keys
or secure channels. That is, to establish the veracity of a
message and its source using only wireless in-band trans-
missions. ˇCapkun et. al. [10] showed that it is possible to
construct such an in-band integrity protection primitive, by
assuming the infeasibility of signal cancellation and com-
bining unidirectional error detection codes and ON/OFF
keying modulation. Later a few works have followed up
in this direction. However, an important question remained
unanswered about its security. Since the security depends
on the infeasibility of signal-cancellation, work should be
done to evaluate to which extent this is true, i.e. there lacks
quantitative analysis of its security. Previously, P¨opper et. al.
[11] demonstrated a practical relaying attack that can fully
cancel the source’s signal in indoor scenarios, regardless
of message content and modulation. In practice, the effect
of signal cancellation attack is similar to message deletion,
which can lead to serious consequences and is also hard
to detect. For example, in the scenarios that the attacker is
capable of canceling out RTS/CTS messages, the CSMA/CA
protocol would suffer from the hidden terminal problem.
In reality,
signal-
cancellation heavily depends on the wireless channel condi-
tions. But again, so far only qualitative results are available,

while no quantitative security guarantee can be provided
by any of the previous designs. Unfortunately, in general
such a security guarantee is quite challenging to establish
for any wireless physical-layer security mechanism. This is
primarily due to a lack of systematic modeling of attacker’s
behaviors in this area, unlike well-known methodologies for
cryptography. To do so one needs to connect the theoretical
and practical aspects of wireless security. In addition, the
fact that wireless is an open medium makes it easy for
common attacks to be launched, thus threat modeling needs
to be comprehensive. A smart and strategic attacker who
is knowledgeable about the wireless channel environment
must be assumed. In fact, depending on the channel envi-
ronment, the channel state information (CSI) can only be
viewed as a partial secret (or non-secret) of the legitimate
communicating pairs. Moreover, the attacker can possess
advanced hardware and processing capabilities such as
multi-antennas and directional antennas. Many other exist-
ing physical layer security schemes failed to provide any
security [12], [13] when the attacker is powerful as such.
In this paper, we ﬁrst present a systematic threat mod-
eling for signal cancellation attacks. We observe that the
attacker can exploit the intrinsic channel correlation existing
in various domain(s) (e.g. temporal, spatial and frequency
domains) to estimate the CSI of the legitimate communi-
cation pairs with help of advanced hardware (such as di-
rectional antennas or multi-antennas). However, no matter
how powerful the attacker is, since the signal cancellation
attack is an active attack, all the attack behaviors must
be carried out in an online fashion. Therefore, we observe
that the success of the signal cancellation attack is only
depending on the channel correlations in the temporal and
spatial domains. Correspondingly, we propose two types
of attack models, which are more general or stronger than
those adopted by existing works.
Rooted in this key observation, we then develop a signal
cancellation attack and defense framework by adapting
previous information-theoretic study in correlated jamming
[14]. Our framework captures the attacker’s knowledge
about the legitimate communication pair’s CSI using a
correlation coefﬁcient. We consider both indoor and outdoor
environments in our system model. The signal cancellation
attack and defense process are modeled as a zero-sum game,
in which the attacker aims at minimizing receiver’s energy
detection probability, while the defender seeks to maximize
this probability. Under this framework, we theoretically
analyze the optimal attack/defense strategies and detec-
tion probability under signal cancellation attack, given any
correlation coefﬁcient. Then we summarize our previous
simulation results that validated our theoretical analysis,
and revealed the impact of attacker’s correlation coefﬁcient
and the detection threshold to the system’s security level.
Based on the theoretical results, we propose a practical
physical-layer message integrity protection approach via
channel randomization. The realization of channel random-
ization builds upon swift reconﬁgurability and state diver-
sity characteristics of the reconﬁgurable antenna (RA). Our
idea is to let the legitimate pair proactively make a worst
case estimation of the attacker’s knowledge of their CSI
(mimic the attacker), and use that to derive a lower-bound of
the energy detection probability under optimal cancellation

attacks. As we need to consider both temporal and spatial
correlations of the CSI, we need to impose some constraints
on the location of the attacker (and we show that the spatial
correlation decreases with attacker’s distance). Interestingly,
by increasing the randomness of the wireless channel over
both temporal and spatial domains via RA, we can achieve
an arbitrary goal of minimum signal detection probability
by tuning the number of symbols in each ON slot.
In addition, we carry out real-world experiments and
implement our channel randomization approach on USRP
devices. We found that by actively randomizing the physical
channel via RA, the indoor static channel can be turned into
a dynamic channel which can effectively defend against sig-
nal cancellation attack and protect message integrity. In con-
trast to prior work in physical layer security, our approach
neither requires nor depends on the channel advantage of
the legitimate channel over the adversary channel.
Compared with our preliminary work [1], our main
additional contributions are: (1) Besides the two attack
models in [1], we propose a more practical attack model,
i.e., the type III attacker, in order to model the attacker
which exploits the channel correlation in spatial domain.
With all three attack models, it is more complete and sys-
tematic to evaluate the security of wireless systems under
signal cancellation attack. (2) We propose a systematic and
effective channel randomization approach which exploits
swift reconﬁgurability and state diversity characteristics of
RA to protect message integrity. Extensive experiments and
security analysis are carried out to show its resistance to op-
timal signal cancellation attack. (3) We present the method to
combine our approach with existing message integrity pro-
tection schemes and evaluate its performance under normal
communication scenarios using BER and link throughput.
(4) We identify that the correlation coefﬁcient and variance
of CSI are two key factors affecting the detection probability
and show the inﬂuence of the selection of antenna modes on
these two factors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
ﬁrst work that systematically employs RA to defend against
signal cancellation attack in the real world.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Sec. 2
presents the related work and motivation to our threat mod-
eling and message integrity protection approach, followed
by the system and attack models in Sec. 3. In Sec. 4, we
present the game-theoretical framework to analyze the at-
tacker/defender’s strategies and their optimal utilities. Sec.
5 gives our channel randomization approach and introduces
our method to protect message integrity in practice. In Sec.
6, we present the implementation and experimental study.
Sec. 7 concludes the paper and lists the insights gained.
2 RELATED WORK AND MOTIVATION
2.1 In-band Message Integrity Protection and Authenti-
cation
A few previous works proposed in-band message integrity
protection and authentication schemes without relying on
pre-shared secret keys [10], [15], [16]. The common underly-
ing idea is to combine ON/OFF keying with unidirectional
error detection code. By using this coding method, bit 1
is encoded into ON OFF slots and bit 0 is encoded into
OFF ON slots. To provide message integrity protection, a

tion and authentication.
data packet is sent ﬁrst using normal modulation, followed
by a cryptographic hash calculated over the message which
is encoded using the ON/OFF keying approach (the idea
is also shown in Fig. 1). The security of this approach
is based on the infeasibility of signal cancellation in the
wireless channel, which ensures that only unidirectional
bit modiﬁcation is feasible, i.e. attacker could only change
OFF slot into ON slot but not in the opposite direction. Be-
sides, according to the second preimage resistance property
of Hash functions, it is computationally infeasible for the
attacker to compute a new message with the same Hash
result. Therefore any tampering with the original message
will be detected (w.h.p.). The authentication property is
derived based on authentication through presence [10],
that is, the received message is authorized if and only
if the receivers verify only one message is received from
the intended transmitter and has not been modiﬁed. Anti-
signal-cancellation is achieved by setting the signal to be
random in each ON slot, and based on the assumption
that attacker could not extract any knowledge of the source
signal and the channel thus it cannot cancel the signal.
However, this assumption is too strong because practical
signal cancellation attack has been demonstrated [11], which
uses a pair of directional antennas to relay the source signal
such that the phase differs by kπ from the direct signal at the
receiver. The signal cancellation attack aims at completely
canceling out the received signal at the receiver, by assum-
ing the attacker knows the transmitted source signal x (or
a correlated version of it). This is achieved in [11] by using
directional antennas, such that the attacker obtains x from
A in real time, and it has almost complete knowledge of
the direct channel from A to B (which is a stable indoor
channel). Through signal cancellation attack, the attacker
has the potential to cancel/modify any signal in wireless
channel. Considering that receiver in ON OFF scheme de-
codes message via energy detection, when encountering
signal cancellation attack, the message integrity cannot be
protected. Thus, it is essential to investigate the possibility
of signal cancellation in the real-world, so as to provide
quantitative security guarantees.
2.2 Channel Randomization
Recent studies in wireless communication show that due
to the inherent randomness of wireless channel such as
multipath, even small motions of the antenna can create
large variations on CSI [17], which makes channel ran-
domization a promising technology in preventing attackers
from estimating accurate CSI. Here, we brieﬂy discuss the
previous works on using channel randomization method to
defend passive attacks and active attacks.
2.2.1 Countering Passive Attacks
The channel randomization approach in [18]–[20] was pro-
posed to defend eavesdroppers for secrecy purpose. In [18],
the transmitter is equipped with eight antennas that are
rotated with a fan motor at a constant speed. In every
transmitter’s ON and OFF states, a micro-controller ran-
domly chooses an antenna to activate. However, since the
fan motor rotates at a constant speed, it is not difﬁcult for
the attacker to obtain and predict the positions of antennas.
For an eavesdropper who is capable of conducting ofﬂine
experiments to measure the CSI of possible paths, once the
attacker gets the positions of antennas, the only unknown
variable left for attacker is which antenna is activated.
Since only eight antennas are used, the eavesdropper could
