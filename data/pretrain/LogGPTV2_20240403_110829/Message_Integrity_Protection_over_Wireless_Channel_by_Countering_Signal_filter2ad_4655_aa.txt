## Abstract
Physical layer message integrity protection and authentication by countering signal cancellation have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional cryptographic methods, as they do not require pre-shared secrets or secure channels. However, the security of these approaches has remained an open problem due to the lack of systematic security modeling and quantitative analysis. In this paper, we first establish a novel signal cancellation attack framework using game theory to study the optimal attacker's behavior and utility. This framework accurately captures the attacker's knowledge of correlated channel estimates in various environments and the online nature of the attack. Based on our theoretical results, we propose a practical channel randomization approach that leverages the state diversity and swift reconfigurability of reconfigurable antennas to increase randomness and reduce the correlation of channel state information (CSI). We demonstrate that by proactively mimicking the attacker and imposing restrictions on the attacker's location, we can bound the attacker's knowledge of CSI, thereby achieving a guaranteed level of message integrity protection. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments and simulations to validate the security and performance of our proposed approach. Our novel threat modeling and quantitative security analysis methodology can benefit a wide range of physical layer security problems.

## 1. Introduction
Message integrity protection and authentication are fundamental security services in the Internet of Things (IoT), especially with the exponential growth of wireless sensors and mobile devices [2]. Traditionally, these services have relied on pre-shared secret keys or secure channels. However, in many scenarios, these assumptions may not hold, such as when establishing initial security associations among constrained wireless devices. Secret key distribution often requires either an offline secure channel or a public key infrastructure (PKI), which may not be feasible due to hardware limitations and the absence of a global PKI. Some research has proposed using out-of-band (OOB) secure auxiliary channels to build message authentication protocols without pre-shared keys [3]–[8]. However, OOB channels require special hardware and significant human interaction, and their security has been questioned [9]. Moreover, re-keying in case of key compromise involves substantial human effort.

Ideally, we aim to provide message integrity protection and authentication without relying on pre-shared keys or secure channels, using only wireless in-band transmissions. Capkun et al. [10] demonstrated that it is possible to construct such an in-band integrity protection primitive by assuming the infeasibility of signal cancellation and combining unidirectional error detection codes with ON/OFF keying modulation. However, the security of this approach depends on the infeasibility of signal cancellation, and there has been no quantitative analysis of its security. Pöpper et al. [11] demonstrated a practical relaying attack that can fully cancel the source's signal in indoor scenarios, leading to serious consequences and making detection difficult. For example, if an attacker cancels RTS/CTS messages, the CSMA/CA protocol would suffer from the hidden terminal problem.

Signal cancellation heavily depends on the wireless channel conditions, but previous work has provided only qualitative results. Establishing a security guarantee for any wireless physical-layer security mechanism is challenging due to the lack of systematic modeling of attacker behaviors, unlike in cryptography. The open nature of wireless media makes it easy for common attacks to be launched, and a comprehensive threat model must assume a smart and strategic attacker with advanced hardware and processing capabilities. The channel state information (CSI) can only be viewed as a partial secret, and existing physical layer security schemes often fail when the attacker is powerful [12], [13].

In this paper, we present a systematic threat model for signal cancellation attacks. We observe that the attacker can exploit intrinsic channel correlations (temporal, spatial, and frequency) to estimate the CSI of legitimate communication pairs. However, since signal cancellation is an active attack, all attack behaviors must be carried out online. Therefore, the success of the attack depends only on temporal and spatial correlations. We propose two types of attack models that are more general or stronger than those in existing works.

Based on this observation, we develop a signal cancellation attack and defense framework by adapting previous information-theoretic studies on correlated jamming [14]. Our framework captures the attacker's knowledge of the legitimate communication pair's CSI using a correlation coefficient. We consider both indoor and outdoor environments and model the attack and defense process as a zero-sum game. The attacker aims to minimize the receiver's energy detection probability, while the defender seeks to maximize it. We theoretically analyze the optimal attack/defense strategies and detection probability under any correlation coefficient. We then summarize our simulation results, which validate our theoretical analysis and reveal the impact of the attacker's correlation coefficient and the detection threshold on the system's security level.

Based on these theoretical results, we propose a practical physical-layer message integrity protection approach via channel randomization. This approach leverages the swift reconfigurability and state diversity of reconfigurable antennas (RAs). Our idea is to let the legitimate pair proactively make a worst-case estimation of the attacker's knowledge of their CSI and use that to derive a lower bound on the energy detection probability under optimal cancellation attacks. By increasing the randomness of the wireless channel over both temporal and spatial domains via RAs, we can achieve an arbitrary goal of minimum signal detection probability by tuning the number of symbols in each ON slot. We also impose constraints on the attacker's location to reduce spatial correlation, which decreases with the attacker's distance.

We conduct real-world experiments and implement our channel randomization approach on USRP devices. We find that by actively randomizing the physical channel via RAs, the indoor static channel can be turned into a dynamic channel, effectively defending against signal cancellation attacks and protecting message integrity. Unlike prior work, our approach does not require or depend on the channel advantage of the legitimate channel over the adversary channel.

Compared to our preliminary work [1], our main additional contributions are:
1. **Practical Attack Model:** We propose a more practical attack model, the Type III attacker, to account for attackers exploiting spatial domain correlations. With all three attack models, we provide a more complete and systematic evaluation of wireless system security under signal cancellation attacks.
2. **Channel Randomization Approach:** We propose a systematic and effective channel randomization approach that leverages the swift reconfigurability and state diversity of RAs to protect message integrity. Extensive experiments and security analyses show its resistance to optimal signal cancellation attacks.
3. **Integration with Existing Schemes:** We present a method to combine our approach with existing message integrity protection schemes and evaluate its performance under normal communication scenarios using BER and link throughput.
4. **Key Factors Analysis:** We identify the correlation coefficient and variance of CSI as key factors affecting the detection probability and show the influence of antenna mode selection on these factors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically employ RAs to defend against signal cancellation attacks in the real world.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents related work and motivation for our threat modeling and message integrity protection approach, followed by the system and attack models in Section 3. In Section 4, we present the game-theoretical framework to analyze the attacker/defender's strategies and their optimal utilities. Section 5 introduces our channel randomization approach and method to protect message integrity in practice. Section 6 presents the implementation and experimental study. Section 7 concludes the paper and lists the insights gained.

## 2. Related Work and Motivation

### 2.1 In-band Message Integrity Protection and Authentication
Several previous works have proposed in-band message integrity protection and authentication schemes without relying on pre-shared secret keys [10], [15], [16]. The underlying idea is to combine ON/OFF keying with unidirectional error detection codes. Bit 1 is encoded into ON-OFF slots, and bit 0 is encoded into OFF-ON slots. To provide message integrity protection, a data packet is sent first using normal modulation, followed by a cryptographic hash calculated over the message, which is encoded using the ON/OFF keying approach (as shown in Fig. 1). The security of this approach is based on the infeasibility of signal cancellation in the wireless channel, ensuring that only unidirectional bit modification is feasible. According to the second preimage resistance property of hash functions, it is computationally infeasible for the attacker to compute a new message with the same hash result. Therefore, any tampering with the original message will be detected (with high probability). The authentication property is derived from the presence-based authentication [10], where the received message is authorized if and only if the receiver verifies that only one message is received from the intended transmitter and has not been modified. Anti-signal-cancellation is achieved by setting the signal to be random in each ON slot, assuming the attacker cannot extract any knowledge of the source signal and the channel, thus cannot cancel the signal.

However, this assumption is too strong because practical signal cancellation attacks have been demonstrated [11], using directional antennas to relay the source signal such that the phase differs by \( k\pi \) from the direct signal at the receiver. The signal cancellation attack aims to completely cancel out the received signal, assuming the attacker knows the transmitted source signal \( x \) (or a correlated version of it). This is achieved in [11] by using directional antennas, allowing the attacker to obtain \( x \) from A in real-time and have almost complete knowledge of the direct channel from A to B (a stable indoor channel). Through signal cancellation, the attacker can potentially cancel or modify any signal in the wireless channel. Since the receiver in the ON-OFF scheme decodes messages via energy detection, encountering a signal cancellation attack compromises message integrity. Thus, it is essential to investigate the possibility of signal cancellation in the real world to provide quantitative security guarantees.

### 2.2 Channel Randomization
Recent studies in wireless communication show that the inherent randomness of wireless channels, such as multipath, can create large variations in CSI even with small antenna movements, making channel randomization a promising technology for preventing attackers from estimating accurate CSI. Here, we briefly discuss previous works on using channel randomization to defend against passive and active attacks.

#### 2.2.1 Countering Passive Attacks
The channel randomization approach in [18]–[20] was proposed to defend against eavesdroppers for secrecy purposes. In [18], the transmitter is equipped with eight antennas that are rotated with a fan motor at a constant speed. In every transmitter's ON and OFF states, a micro-controller randomly chooses an antenna to activate. However, since the fan motor rotates at a constant speed, it is not difficult for the attacker to predict the positions of the antennas. An eavesdropper capable of conducting offline experiments to measure the CSI of possible paths can easily determine which antenna is activated once the positions are known. Given that only eight antennas are used, the eavesdropper could still predict the channel conditions with reasonable accuracy.
