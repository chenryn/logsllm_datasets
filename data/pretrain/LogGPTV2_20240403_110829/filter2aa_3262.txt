in conclusion…
execution stuff
CA glue

Baking Soda 
This is not a fast process.
When building with imprecise 
and/or unknown ﬁnal measurements, 
don’t be greedy with the material.
Don’t forget about structure.
Fail.
Fail. 
A  LOT.
why “macgyver” stuff? 
Improved critical 
thinking skills
Practical engineering XP++
parting challenge:
never 
stop 
building 
stuff
Your quirky, oﬀbeat,  
“too much time on your hands” 
side project doesn’t have 
to measure up to anything…
You don’t have to 
change the world to 
establish a precedent.
…it just has to be done.
NO ONE CAN UNDO THAT.
thanks!
