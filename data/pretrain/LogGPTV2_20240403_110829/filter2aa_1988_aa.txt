### Linguistic Analysis and Word Count Output for Big Five and Dark Triad Traits

#### Talk Title: Can Twitter Help Expose Psychopathic Killerâ€™s Traits?

#### Presenters: Chris Sumner & Randall Wald

**Abstract:**

Recent research has established a connection between psychopaths and the language they use (Hancock et al., 2011). Media reports suggest that this knowledge could be applied to social networks to assist law enforcement agencies in identifying "psychopathic killers' traits." This is the first public study to explore psychopathy in the context of social media.

This study investigates the feasibility of determining psychopathy and other personality traits based on Twitter usage. We compared self-assessed 'Dark Triad' (Psychopathy, Machiavellianism, Narcissism) and 'Big Five' (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) personality traits with the Twitter information, usage, and language of 2,927 participants.

Our results show statistically significant correlations between individuals' darker personality traits and their Twitter activity. We also found links between users' attitudes toward privacy, their personality traits, and their Twitter use. The talk will present the improvements possible through the use of machine learning for personality prediction and share the models and techniques employed.

In addition to presenting our findings, this talk will provide an introduction to identifying psychopathic traits using the Hare Psychopathy Checklist (PCL-R), discuss the technical approaches to collecting, storing, and analyzing Twitter data using open-source technologies, and address the current ethical, privacy, and human rights concerns surrounding social media analysis, vetting, and labeling.

We will conclude with two proof-of-concept works: the first uses the visualization tool Maltego to explore how visual analysis can identify potential troublemakers at events such as far-right demonstrations; the second examines how personality traits influence responses and interactions with a benign Twitter bot.

The results highlight that, in certain contexts, personality prediction through social media can achieve a reasonably high degree of accuracy.
