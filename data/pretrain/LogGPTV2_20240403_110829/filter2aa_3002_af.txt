zard has demonstrated that it did not authorize MDY to circumvent
Warden.

[20] The fifth element is met because Warden is an effec-
tive access control measure. To “effectively control access to
a work,” a technological measure must “in the ordinary course
of its operation, require[ ] the application of information, or
a process or a treatment, with the authority of the copyright
owner, 
to 
gain 
access 
to 
the 
work.” 
17 
U.S.C.
§ 1201(a)(3)(B). Both of Warden’s two components “re-
quire[ ] the application of information, or a process or a treat-
ment . . . to gain access to the work.” For a player to connect
to Blizzard’s servers which provide access to WoW’s
dynamic non-literal elements, scan.dll must scan the player’s
computer RAM and confirm the absence of any bots or
cheats. The resident component also requires a “process” in
order for the user to continue accessing the work: the user’s
computer must report portions of WoW code running in RAM
to the server. Moreover, Warden’s provisions were put into
place by Blizzard, and thus, function “with the authority of
the copyright owner.” Accordingly, Warden effectively con-
trols access to WoW’s dynamic non-literal elements.
17 We
hold that MDY is liable under § 1201(a)(2) with respect to
WoW’s dynamic non-literal elements.
18 Accordingly, we
affirm the district court’s entry of a permanent injunction
against MDY to prevent future § 1201(a)(2) violations.
17The statutory definition of the phrase “effectively control access to a
work” does not require that an access control measure be strong or
circumvention-proof. Rather, it requires an access control measure to pro-
vide some degree of control over access to a copyrighted work. As one
district court has observed, if the word “effectively” were read to mean
that the statute protects “only successful or efficacious technological
means of controlling access,” it would “gut” DMCA § 1201(a)(2), because
it would “limit the application of the statute to access control measures
that thwart circumvention, but withhold protection for those measures that
can be circumvented.” See Universal City Studios v. Reimerdes, 111 F.
Supp. 2d 294, 318 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (“Defendants would have the Court
construe the statute to offer protection where none is needed but to with-
hold protection precisely where protection is essential.”). 
18We note that the DMCA allows innocent violators to seek reduction
or remittance of damages. See 17 U.S.C. § 1203(c)(5).

Case: 09-16044   12/14/2010   Page: 40 of 47    ID: 7579806   DktEntry: 54-1
F. Blizzard’s § 1201(b)(1) claim
[21] Blizzard may prevail under § 1201(b)(1) only if War-
den “effectively protect[s] a right” of Blizzard under the
Copyright Act. Blizzard contends that Warden protects its
reproduction right against unauthorized copying. We disagree.
First, although WoW players copy the software code into
RAM while playing the game, Blizzard’s EULA and ToU
authorize all licensed WoW players to do so. We have
explained that ToU § 4(B)’s bot prohibition is a license cove-
nant rather than a condition. Thus, a Glider user who violates
this covenant does not infringe by continuing to copy code
into RAM. Accordingly, MDY does not violate § 1201(b)(1)
by enabling Glider users to avoid Warden’s interruption of
their authorized copying into RAM. 
[22] Second, although WoW players can theoretically
record game play by taking screen shots, there is no evidence
that Warden detects or prevents such allegedly infringing copy-
ing.
19 This is logical, because Warden was designed to reduce
the presence of cheats and bots, not to protect WoW’s
dynamic non-literal elements against copying. We conclude
that Warden does not effectively protect any of Blizzard’s
rights under the Copyright Act, and MDY is not liable under
§ 1201(b)(1) for Glider’s circumvention of Warden.
20
19No evidence establishes that Glider users engage in this practice, and
Glider itself does not provide a software mechanism for taking screenshots
or otherwise reproducing copyrighted WoW material. 
20The district court permanently enjoined “MDY and Michael Donnelly
from engaging in contributory or vicarious copyright infringement and
from violating the DMCA with respect to Blizzard’s copyrights in and
rights to” WoW. Because we conclude that MDY is not liable under
§ 1201(b)(1), we vacate the aspect of the permanent injunction dealing
with MDY’s and Donnelly’s § 1201(b)(1) liability.

VI.
The district court granted Blizzard summary judgment on
its claim against MDY for tortious interference with contract
(“tortious interference”) under Arizona law and held that
Donnelly was personally liable for MDY’s tortious interfer-
ence. We review the district court’s grant of summary judg-
ment de novo. See Canyon Ferry Rd. Baptist Church of East
Helena, Inc. v. Unsworth, 556 F.3d 1021, 1027 (9th Cir.
2009). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to
non-movant MDY in determining whether there are any genu-
ine issues of material fact. Id. Because we conclude that there
are triable issues of material fact, we vacate and remand for
trial.
A. Elements of Blizzard’s tortious interference claim
To recover for tortious interference under Arizona law,
Blizzard must prove: (1) the existence of a valid contractual
relationship; (2) MDY’s knowledge of the relationship; (3)
MDY’s intentional interference in inducing or causing the
breach; (4) the impropriety of MDY’s interference; and (5)
resulting damages. See Safeway Ins. Co. v. Guerrero, 106
P.3d 102, 1025 (Ariz. 2005); see also Antwerp Diamond
Exch. of Am., Inc. v. Better Bus. Bur. of Maricopa County,
Inc., 637 P.2d 733, 740 (Ariz. 1981).
Blizzard satisfies four of these five elements based on
undisputed facts. First, a valid contractual relationship exists
between Blizzard and its customers based on the operative
EULA and ToU. Second, MDY was aware of this relation-
ship: it does not contend that it was unaware of the operative
EULA and ToU, or unaware that using Glider breached their
terms. In fact, after Blizzard first attempted to ban Glider
users, MDY modified its website to notify customers that
using Glider violated the ToU. Third, MDY intentionally
interfered with Blizzard’s contracts. After Blizzard used War-
den to ban a majority of Glider users in September 2005,

MDY INDUSTRIES v. BLIZZARD ENTERTAINMENT
Case: 09-16044   12/14/2010   Page: 42 of 47    ID: 7579806   DktEntry: 54-1
MDY programmed Glider to be undetectable by Warden.
Finally, Blizzard has proffered evidence that it was damaged
by MDY’s conduct. 
Thus, Blizzard is entitled to summary judgment if there are
no triable issues of material fact as to the fourth element of
its tortious interference claim: whether MDY’s actions were
improper. To determine whether a defendant’s conduct was
improper, Arizona employs the seven-factor test of Restate-
ment (Second) of Torts § 767. See Safeway, 106 P.3d at 1027;
see also Wagonseller v. Scottsdale Mem’l Hosp., 710 P.2d
1025, 1042-43 (Ariz. 1985), superseded in other respects by
A.R.S. § 23-1501. The seven factors are (1) the nature of
MDY’s conduct, (2) MDY’s motive, (3) Blizzard’s interests
with which MDY interfered, (4) the interests MDY sought to
advance, (5) the social interests in protecting MDY’s freedom
of action and Blizzard’s contractual interests, (6) the proxim-
ity or remoteness of MDY’s conduct to the interference, and
(7) the relations between MDY and Blizzard. Id. A court
should give greatest weight to the first two factors. Id. We
conclude that summary judgment was inappropriate here,
because on the current record, taking the facts in the light
most favorable to MDY, the first five factors do not clearly
weigh in either side’s favor, thus creating a genuine issue of
material fact.
1. Nature of MDY’s conduct and MDY’s motive
The parties have presented conflicting evidence with
respect to these two most important factors. Blizzard’s evi-
dence tends to demonstrate that MDY helped Glider users
gain an advantage over other WoW players by advancing
automatically to a higher level of the game. Thus, MDY
knowingly assisted Glider users to breach their contracts, and
then helped to conceal those breaches from Blizzard. Bliz-
zard’s evidence also supports the conclusion that Blizzard was
negatively affected by MDY’s Glider sales, because Glider
use: (1) distorts WoW’s virtual economy by flooding it with

Case: 09-16044   12/14/2010   Page: 43 of 47    ID: 7579806   DktEntry: 54-1
excess resources; (2) interferes with WoW players’ ability to
interact with other human players in the virtual world; and (3)
strains Blizzard’s servers because bots spend more continuous
time in-game than do human players. Finally, Blizzard intro-
duced evidence that MDY’s motive was its three and a half
to four million dollar profit.
On the other hand, MDY proffered evidence that it created
Glider in 2005, when Blizzard’s ToU did not explicitly pro-
hibit bots.
21 Glider initially had no anti-detection features.
MDY added these features only after Blizzard added Warden
to WoW. Blizzard did not change the EULA or ToU to pro-
scribe bots such as Glider explicitly until after MDY began
selling Glider. Finally, MDY has introduced evidence that
Glider enhances some players’ experience of the game,
including players who might otherwise not play WoW at all.
Taking this evidence in the light most favorable to MDY,
there is a genuine issue of material fact as to these factors.
2. Blizzard’s interests with which MDY interferes; the
interest that MDY seeks to advance; the social interest
in protecting MDY’s and Blizzard’s respective interests
Blizzard argues that it seeks to provide its millions of WoW
players with a particular role-playing game experience that
excludes bots. It contends, as the district court determined,
that MDY’s interest depends on inducing Blizzard’s custom-
ers to breach their contracts. In contrast, MDY argues that
Glider is an innovative, profitable software program that has
positively affected its users’ lives by advancing them to
WoW’s more interesting levels. MDY has introduced evi-
21When MDY created Glider in 2005, Blizzard’s ToU prohibited the use
of “cheats” and “unauthorized third-party software” in connection with
WoW. The meaning of these contractual terms, including whether they
prohibit bots such as Glider, is ambiguous. In Arizona, the construction of
ambiguous contract provisions is a jury question. See Clark v. Compania
Ganadera de Cananea, S.A., 385 P.2d 691, 697-98 (Ariz. 1963).

MDY INDUSTRIES v. BLIZZARD ENTERTAINMENT
Case: 09-16044   12/14/2010   Page: 44 of 47    ID: 7579806   DktEntry: 54-1
dence that Glider allows players with limited motor skills to
continue to play WoW, improves some users’ romantic rela-
tionships by reducing the time that they spend playing WoW,
and allows users who work long hours to play WoW. We fur-
ther note that, if the fact-finder decides that Blizzard did not
ban bots at the time that MDY created Glider, the fact-finder
might conclude that MDY had a legitimate interest in continu-
ing to sell Glider. Again, the parties’ differing evidence
creates a genuine issue of material fact that precludes an
award of summary judgment.
3. Proximity of MDY’s conduct to the interference; 
relationship between MDY and Blizzard
[23] MDY’s Glider sales are the but-for cause of Glider
users’ breach of the operative ToU. Moreover, Blizzard and
MDY are not competitors in the online role-playing game
market; rather, MDY’s profits appear to depend on the contin-
ued popularity of WoW. Blizzard, however, chose not to
authorize MDY to sell Glider to its users. Even accepting that
these factors favor Blizzard, we do not think that they inde-
pendently warrant a grant of summary judgment to Blizzard.
As noted, we cannot hold that five of the seven “impropriety”
factors compel a finding in Blizzard’s favor at this stage,
including the two (nature of MDY’s conduct and MDY’s
motive) that the Arizona courts deem most important.
Accordingly, we vacate the district court’s grant of summary
judgment to Blizzard.

B. Copyright Act preemption
MDY contends that Blizzard’s tortious interference claim
is preempted by the Copyright Act. The Copyright Act pre-
empts state laws that confer rights equivalent to the exclusive
22Because the district court entered a permanent injunction based on
MDY’s liability for tortious interference, we also vacate that permanent
injunction.

MDY INDUSTRIES v. BLIZZARD ENTERTAINMENT
Case: 09-16044   12/14/2010   Page: 45 of 47    ID: 7579806   DktEntry: 54-1
rights of copyright under 17 U.S.C. § 106 (i.e., reproduction,
distribution, public display, public performance, and creation
of derivative works). 17 U.S.C. § 301(a). However, the Copy-
right Act does not preempt state law remedies with respect to
“activities violating legal or equitable rights that are not
equivalent to any of the exclusive rights [of copyright].” 17
U.S.C. § 301(b)(3). 
[24] Whether, in these circumstances, tortious interference
with contract is preempted by the Copyright Act is a question
of first impression in this circuit. However, we have previ-
ously addressed a similar tortious interference cause of action
under California law and found it not preempted. See Altera
Corp. v. Clear Logic, Inc., 424 F.3d 1079, 1089-90 (9th Cir.
2005). In so holding, we relied on the Seventh Circuit’s analy-
sis in ProCD, 86 F.3d 1447, which explained that because
contractual rights are not equivalent to the exclusive rights of
copyright, the Copyright Act’s preemption clause usually
does not affect private contracts. Altera, 424 F.3d at 1089; see
ProCD, 86 F.3d at 1454 (“A copyright is a right against the
world. Contracts, by contrast, generally affect only their par-
ties; strangers may do as they please, so contracts do not
create ‘exclusive rights.’ ”). The Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth
Circuits have also held that the Copyright Act does not pre-
empt a party’s enforcement of its contractual rights. See Nat’l
Car Rental Sys., Inc. v. Comp. Assoc. Int’l, Inc., 991 F.2d 426,
433 (8th Cir. 1993); Taquino v. Teledyne Monarch Rubber,
893 F.2d 1488, 1501 (5th Cir. 1990); Acorn Structures, Inc.
v. Swantz, 846 F.2d 923, 926 (4th Cir. 1988). 
[25] This action concerns the anti-bot provisions of ToU
§ 4(b)(ii) and (iii), which we have held are contract-
enforceable covenants rather than copyright-enforceable con-
ditions. We conclude that since Blizzard seeks to enforce con-
tractual rights that are not equivalent to any of its exclusive
rights of copyright, the Copyright Act does not preempt its
tortious interference claim. Cf. Altera, 424 F0.3d at 1089-90.
