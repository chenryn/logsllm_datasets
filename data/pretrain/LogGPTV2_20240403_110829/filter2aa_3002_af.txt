### Satisfaction of the "Circumvention" Element under § 1201(a)(2)

Blizzard has demonstrated that MDY was not authorized to circumvent Warden, thereby satisfying the "circumvention" element of a § 1201(a)(2) claim.

### Effective Access Control Measure

The fifth element is met because Warden is an effective access control measure. For a technological measure to "effectively control access to a work," it must, in the ordinary course of its operation, require the application of information, or a process or treatment, with the authority of the copyright owner, to gain access to the work. (17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(3)(B)).

Both components of Warden meet this requirement. To connect to Blizzard's servers and access World of Warcraft's (WoW) dynamic non-literal elements, scan.dll must scan the player’s computer RAM and confirm the absence of any bots or cheats. The resident component also requires a process for the user to continue accessing the game: the user’s computer must report portions of WoW code running in RAM to the server. Since Warden's provisions were implemented by Blizzard, they function with the authority of the copyright owner. Therefore, Warden effectively controls access to WoW's dynamic non-literal elements.

We hold that MDY is liable under § 1201(a)(2) with respect to WoW’s dynamic non-literal elements. Accordingly, we affirm the district court’s entry of a permanent injunction against MDY to prevent future § 1201(a)(2) violations.

### Statutory Definition of "Effectively Control Access"

The statutory definition of "effectively control access to a work" does not require that an access control measure be strong or circumvention-proof. Instead, it requires that the measure provide some degree of control over access to a copyrighted work. As one district court has observed, if "effectively" were interpreted to mean only successful or efficacious technological means of controlling access, it would "gut" DMCA § 1201(a)(2), as it would limit the statute's protection to measures that thwart circumvention but withhold protection for those that can be circumvented. (See Universal City Studios v. Reimerdes, 111 F. Supp. 2d 294, 318 (S.D.N.Y. 2000)).

### Innocent Violators and Damages

It is noted that the DMCA allows innocent violators to seek reduction or remittance of damages. (17 U.S.C. § 1203(c)(5)).

### Blizzard’s § 1201(b)(1) Claim

Blizzard may prevail under § 1201(b)(1) only if Warden "effectively protects a right" of Blizzard under the Copyright Act. Blizzard contends that Warden protects its reproduction right against unauthorized copying. We disagree.

First, although WoW players copy the software code into RAM while playing the game, Blizzard’s End User License Agreement (EULA) and Terms of Use (ToU) authorize all licensed WoW players to do so. We have explained that ToU § 4(B)’s bot prohibition is a license covenant rather than a condition. Thus, a Glider user who violates this covenant does not infringe by continuing to copy code into RAM. Therefore, MDY does not violate § 1201(b)(1) by enabling Glider users to avoid Warden’s interruption of their authorized copying into RAM.

Second, although WoW players can theoretically record gameplay by taking screenshots, there is no evidence that Warden detects or prevents such allegedly infringing copying. This is logical, as Warden was designed to reduce the presence of cheats and bots, not to protect WoW’s dynamic non-literal elements against copying. We conclude that Warden does not effectively protect any of Blizzard’s rights under the Copyright Act, and MDY is not liable under § 1201(b)(1) for Glider’s circumvention of Warden.

### Tortious Interference with Contract

The district court granted Blizzard summary judgment on its claim against MDY for tortious interference with contract under Arizona law and held that Donnelly was personally liable for MDY’s tortious interference. We review the district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo. (See Canyon Ferry Rd. Baptist Church of East Helena, Inc. v. Unsworth, 556 F.3d 1021, 1027 (9th Cir. 2009)). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to non-movant MDY in determining whether there are any genuine issues of material fact. Because we conclude that there are triable issues of material fact, we vacate and remand for trial.

#### Elements of Blizzard’s Tortious Interference Claim

To recover for tortious interference under Arizona law, Blizzard must prove:
1. The existence of a valid contractual relationship.
2. MDY’s knowledge of the relationship.
3. MDY’s intentional interference in inducing or causing the breach.
4. The impropriety of MDY’s interference.
5. Resulting damages. (See Safeway Ins. Co. v. Guerrero, 106 P.3d 102, 1025 (Ariz. 2005); see also Antwerp Diamond Exch. of Am., Inc. v. Better Bus. Bur. of Maricopa County, Inc., 637 P.2d 733, 740 (Ariz. 1981)).

Blizzard satisfies four of these five elements based on undisputed facts. First, a valid contractual relationship exists between Blizzard and its customers based on the operative EULA and ToU. Second, MDY was aware of this relationship, as it does not contend that it was unaware of the operative EULA and ToU, or that using Glider breached their terms. In fact, after Blizzard first attempted to ban Glider users, MDY modified its website to notify customers that using Glider violated the ToU. Third, MDY intentionally interfered with Blizzard’s contracts. After Blizzard used Warden to ban a majority of Glider users in September 2005, MDY programmed Glider to be undetectable by Warden. Finally, Blizzard has proffered evidence that it was damaged by MDY’s conduct.

Thus, Blizzard is entitled to summary judgment if there are no triable issues of material fact as to the fourth element of its tortious interference claim: whether MDY’s actions were improper. To determine whether a defendant’s conduct was improper, Arizona employs the seven-factor test of Restatement (Second) of Torts § 767. (See Safeway, 106 P.3d at 1027; see also Wagonseller v. Scottsdale Mem’l Hosp., 710 P.2d 1025, 1042-43 (Ariz. 1985), superseded in other respects by A.R.S. § 23-1501). The seven factors are:
1. The nature of MDY’s conduct.
2. MDY’s motive.
3. Blizzard’s interests with which MDY interfered.
4. The interests MDY sought to advance.
5. The social interests in protecting MDY’s freedom of action and Blizzard’s contractual interests.
6. The proximity or remoteness of MDY’s conduct to the interference.
7. The relations between MDY and Blizzard.

A court should give greatest weight to the first two factors. We conclude that summary judgment was inappropriate here, because on the current record, taking the facts in the light most favorable to MDY, the first five factors do not clearly weigh in either side’s favor, thus creating a genuine issue of material fact.

#### Nature of MDY’s Conduct and MDY’s Motive

The parties have presented conflicting evidence with respect to these two most important factors. Blizzard’s evidence tends to demonstrate that MDY helped Glider users gain an advantage over other WoW players by advancing automatically to a higher level of the game. Thus, MDY knowingly assisted Glider users to breach their contracts and then helped to conceal those breaches from Blizzard. Blizzard’s evidence also supports the conclusion that Blizzard was negatively affected by MDY’s Glider sales, as Glider use:
1. Distorts WoW’s virtual economy by flooding it with excess resources.
2. Interferes with WoW players’ ability to interact with other human players in the virtual world.
3. Strains Blizzard’s servers because bots spend more continuous time in-game than do human players.

Finally, Blizzard introduced evidence that MDY’s motive was its three and a half to four million dollar profit.

On the other hand, MDY proffered evidence that it created Glider in 2005 when Blizzard’s ToU did not explicitly prohibit bots. Glider initially had no anti-detection features. MDY added these features only after Blizzard added Warden to WoW. Blizzard did not change the EULA or ToU to explicitly prohibit bots such as Glider until after MDY began selling Glider. Finally, MDY has introduced evidence that Glider enhances some players’ experience of the game, including players who might otherwise not play WoW at all. Taking this evidence in the light most favorable to MDY, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to these factors.

#### Blizzard’s Interests and Social Interests

Blizzard argues that it seeks to provide its millions of WoW players with a particular role-playing game experience that excludes bots. It contends, as the district court determined, that MDY’s interest depends on inducing Blizzard’s customers to breach their contracts. In contrast, MDY argues that Glider is an innovative, profitable software program that has positively affected its users’ lives by advancing them to WoW’s more interesting levels. MDY has introduced evidence that Glider allows players with limited motor skills to continue to play WoW, improves some users’ romantic relationships by reducing the time they spend playing WoW, and allows users who work long hours to play WoW. We further note that, if the fact-finder decides that Blizzard did not ban bots at the time that MDY created Glider, the fact-finder might conclude that MDY had a legitimate interest in continuing to sell Glider. Again, the parties’ differing evidence creates a genuine issue of material fact that precludes an award of summary judgment.

#### Proximity of MDY’s Conduct and Relationship

MDY’s Glider sales are the but-for cause of Glider users’ breach of the operative ToU. Moreover, Blizzard and MDY are not competitors in the online role-playing game market; rather, MDY’s profits appear to depend on the continued popularity of WoW. Blizzard, however, chose not to authorize MDY to sell Glider to its users. Even accepting that these factors favor Blizzard, we do not think that they independently warrant a grant of summary judgment to Blizzard. As noted, we cannot hold that five of the seven “impropriety” factors compel a finding in Blizzard’s favor at this stage, including the two (nature of MDY’s conduct and MDY’s motive) that the Arizona courts deem most important. Accordingly, we vacate the district court’s grant of summary judgment to Blizzard.

### Copyright Act Preemption

MDY contends that Blizzard’s tortious interference claim is preempted by the Copyright Act. The Copyright Act preempts state laws that confer rights equivalent to the exclusive rights of copyright under 17 U.S.C. § 106 (i.e., reproduction, distribution, public display, public performance, and creation of derivative works). (17 U.S.C. § 301(a)). However, the Copyright Act does not preempt state law remedies with respect to "activities violating legal or equitable rights that are not equivalent to any of the exclusive rights [of copyright]." (17 U.S.C. § 301(b)(3)).

Whether, in these circumstances, tortious interference with contract is preempted by the Copyright Act is a question of first impression in this circuit. However, we have previously addressed a similar tortious interference cause of action under California law and found it not preempted. (See Altera Corp. v. Clear Logic, Inc., 424 F.3d 1079, 1089-90 (9th Cir. 2005)). In so holding, we relied on the Seventh Circuit’s analysis in ProCD, 86 F.3d 1447, which explained that because contractual rights are not equivalent to the exclusive rights of copyright, the Copyright Act’s preemption clause usually does not affect private contracts. (Altera, 424 F.3d at 1089; see ProCD, 86 F.3d at 1454 ("A copyright is a right against the world. Contracts, by contrast, generally affect only their parties; strangers may do as they please, so contracts do not create 'exclusive rights.'")).

The Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Circuits have also held that the Copyright Act does not preempt a party’s enforcement of its contractual rights. (See Nat’l Car Rental Sys., Inc. v. Comp. Assoc. Int’l, Inc., 991 F.2d 426, 433 (8th Cir. 1993); Taquino v. Teledyne Monarch Rubber, 893 F.2d 1488, 1501 (5th Cir. 1990); Acorn Structures, Inc. v. Swantz, 846 F.2d 923, 926 (4th Cir. 1988)).

This action concerns the anti-bot provisions of ToU § 4(b)(ii) and (iii), which we have held are contract-enforceable covenants rather than copyright-enforceable conditions. We conclude that since Blizzard seeks to enforce contractual rights that are not equivalent to any of its exclusive rights of copyright, the Copyright Act does not preempt its tortious interference claim. (Cf. Altera, 424 F.3d at 1089-90).
