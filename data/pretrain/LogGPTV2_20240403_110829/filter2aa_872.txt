### Story Time: Supply Acquisition and Circuit Interrupts Around the Home

#### Purpose of Circuit Interrupts
Circuit interrupters are designed to enhance safety in residential and commercial settings. The two primary types, GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) and AFCI (Arc Fault Circuit Interrupter), serve different but equally important purposes:

- **GFCI**: Intended to prevent electric shock by detecting ground faults—situations where electrical current takes an unintended path to the ground.
- **AFCI**: Designed to prevent fires by detecting and interrupting arc faults—unintended electrical discharges that can occur in damaged or deteriorated wiring.

#### Code Requirements for GFCI and AFCI
**GFCI Requirements:**
- Bathrooms and other indoor wet locations
- Garages, storage areas, non-habitable spaces, and unfinished basements
- Outdoor areas, including compartments accessible from outside, rooftops, pools, and hot tubs
- Crawl spaces at or below grade level
- Kitchen (specifically for dishwashers and refrigerators)
- Laundry areas

**AFCI Requirements:**
- Kitchens
- Family rooms
- Dining rooms
- Living rooms
- Parlors
- Libraries
- Dens
- Bedrooms
- Sunrooms
- Recreation rooms
- Closets and hallways
- Laundry areas
- Similar rooms

#### Relevance and Impact
- **RFI (Radio Frequency Interference)**: Can be either accidental or intentional. It is wireless and leaves no physical trace.
- **Annoying DoS (Denial of Service)/Neighbor Trolling**: RFI can cause disruptions in public facilities and affect critical devices.
- **Public Facilities and Critical Devices**: Ensuring the reliability of these systems is crucial.

#### Suggested Solutions
- **Update to Newer Circuit Breaker Technology**: Adopting the latest circuit breaker patents can enhance safety and reduce the risk of interference.
- **Uninterrupted Power Supply Alternatives**: Consider using batteries or backup power generators to ensure continuous power supply during outages.
