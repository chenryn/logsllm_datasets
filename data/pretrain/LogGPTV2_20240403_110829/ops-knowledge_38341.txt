User: As I understood, I have two versions of python 2.7 installed on my machine. One is located in /usr/bin and another one is in /usr/local/bin. When I type python in the shell, it calls one in /usr/local/bin, and it doesn't have access to all the packages installed using apt-get and pip. I have tried to set up an alias, but when I type sudo python it still calls one in /usr/local/bin. I want to always use one in /usr/bin, since I have all the packages there. How do I do that?
Assistant: From what I understood, 

You have two version of python. One is in /usr/local/bin/python
and another is in /usr/bin/python. 
In your current configuration default python ->
/usr/local/bin/python
You want to use the one that is in /usr/bin. 

Update your ~/.bashrc and append this line at the end
alias python=/usr/bin/python
Then open a new terminal. Or do source ~/.bashrc in the current terminal
Run which python to see the location of the python executable. It will show you /usr/bin/python

Also, if you want to get packages in your current python (i.e. /usr/local/bin/python) you can use pip with that particular python version.

Find pip location using which pip 
Assuming pip location is /usr/local/bin/pip
/usr/local/bin/python /usr/local/bin/pip install
