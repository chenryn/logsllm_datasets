**Title: Unnoticed Theft: The Current State of Mobile Wallet Security**

Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay have become the go-to payment services for mobile users. Their growth and popularity, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, have provided a convenient and often contactless way to make payments, reducing the need to touch payment terminals. Many consider mobile wallets to be at the forefront of payment security. However, our research reveals that these services do not adequately protect their customers from malicious actors; instead, they primarily safeguard themselves.

In our investigation, we discovered inconsistencies in "contactless payments for public transport" schemes that can lead to potential fraud using lost or stolen mobile phones. We were able to successfully defraud victims by making unauthorized transactions at stores around the world, all without the phone ever leaving the victim's pocket.

This presentation will delve into the intricacies of contactless payments via mobile wallets, exploring the underlying infrastructure, liability rules, and the vulnerabilities that exist within these systems.
