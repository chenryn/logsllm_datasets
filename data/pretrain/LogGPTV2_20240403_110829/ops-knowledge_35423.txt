User: How to configure the network and security group policies of the cloud server to ensure the network security of the server?
Assistant: To configure the network and security group policy of the cloud server, you can take the following steps to ensure the network security of the server: 1. Configure the network environment: select the appropriate type and region of the cloud server, and specify the VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) and sub-network required by the server. net. VPC-level network ACLs can be configured to ensure security. 2. Configure a security group: When creating an instance, you need to select an appropriate security group. A security group is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic. Security groups can be configured in the form of rules to implement access control on ports and protocols on the server. 3. Enable security features: the cloud server provides a variety of security features, such as protection against DDos attacks, prevention of brute force cracking, and firewalls. Users need to select appropriate security features and configure them properly according to application scenarios. 4. Manage user permissions: By providing necessary authorization, while providing sufficient access to server resources, the security of sensitive data is guaranteed. It is recommended to delete unnecessary default accounts, set strong passwords and two-factor authentication mechanisms, etc. 5. Regularly update system patches: timely update the patches of the operating system and applications, and fix the discovered security holes to reduce potential risks. 6. Monitor server status: monitor server activity status in a timely manner and find abnormal situations, and minimize losses as much as possible when security incidents occur.
