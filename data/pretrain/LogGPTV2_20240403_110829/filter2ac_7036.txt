### Title: Botconf 2015 - Sandbox Detection for the Masses: Leak, Abuse, Test

**Abstract:**

Manual analysis of malware samples has become impractical due to the sheer volume and complexity. To address this, sandboxes are widely used in both antivirus (AV) companies and enterprises to automate the analysis of malware, providing insights into their dynamic behavior. However, some malware employs known techniques to detect when it is running in a sandbox, which can then be flagged as malicious. 

During my research, I developed novel methods to detect these sandboxes. I created a tool that gathers extensive information from various sandboxes, enabling the generation of detailed statistics on how current sandbox technologies operate and where they fail. My presentation will include a demonstration of these new detection techniques, which are more sophisticated and less likely to be easily flagged as malicious.

Additionally, I will explore the challenges posed by sandboxes that do not interact with the internet, which are designed to prevent data exfiltration. Despite these restrictions, I will show how DNS-based techniques can still be used to extract valuable information from such environments.
