User:  How to use Python to monitor the memory usage of web applications?
Assistant: You can use psutil and the Flask-Caching module to monitor the memory usage of web applications. The specific steps are as follows: 1. Install the psutil and Flask-Caching modules: ```python pip install psutil Flask-Caching ``` 2. Use the Flask-Caching module to set the cache in the Flask application to view the memory used by the application: ` ``python from flask import Flask from flask_caching import Cache app = Flask(__name__) cache = Cache(config={'CACHE_TYPE': 'simple'}) cache.init_app(app) @app.route("/") @cache .cached(timeout=30) def hello_world(): return "Hello, World!" ``` 3. Use the psutil module to monitor application memory usage: ```python import psutil @app.route("/memory-usage" ) def memory_usage(): process = psutil.Process() memory_info = process.memory_info() return f"Memory Usage: {memory_info.rss / 1024 / 1024} MB" ``` In the code above, `psutil.Process The ()` method can be used to obtain the current process object, and the `memory_info()` method can return the memory information of the process. `memory_info.rss` can get the amount of physical memory occupied by the current process.
