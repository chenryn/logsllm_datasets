### Description
When I declare a block scoped variable in a switch block, it's not recognized
as a block scoped variable for purpose of functions, even when it's declared
inside a for loop. This example prints 2, 2, 2, when it should print 0, 1, 2.
(I outright apologize if this is a duplicate, finding duplicates with that bug
tracker is annoying)
