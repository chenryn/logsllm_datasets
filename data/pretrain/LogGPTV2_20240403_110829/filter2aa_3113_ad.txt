### Analysis of Overlapping Outages

The high frequency of overlapping outages between AS57604 and AS29004 is unique and strongly suggests a close relationship between these two sibling autonomous systems. The table below lists all overlapping outages between each of the sibling autonomous systems and their upstream provider, AS48361.

**Table 10. Overlapping Outages Between Sibling ASNs**

| ASN       | 57604 | 8287 | 50896 | 49236 | 29004 | 45020 | 44093 | 48949 | 49720 | 50818 | 48361 |
|-----------|-------|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **57604** |   x   |  20  |  17   |  12   |  22   |  16   |  11   |  24   |  20   |  13   |   5   |
| **8287**  |  20   |   x  |  41   |  15   |  17   |  17   |  15   |  18   |  18   |  15   |   5   |
| **50896** |  17   |  41  |   x   |  17   |  16   |  17   |  18   |  19   |  16   |  18   |   7   |
| **49236** |  12   |  15  |  17   |   x   |   8   |  15   |  13   |   8   |  12   |  17   |   3   |
| **29004** |  22   |  17  |  16   |   8   |   x   |  12   |  22   |  28   |  18   |   9   |   6   |
| **45020** |  16   |  17  |  17   |  15   |  12   |   x   |  12   |  12   |  12   |  15   |   4   |
| **44093** |  11   |  15  |  18   |  13   |  22   |  12   |   x   |  16   |  10   |  13   |   6   |
| **48949** |  24   |  18  |  19   |   8   |  28   |  12   |  16   |   x   |  20   |   9   |   8   |
| **49720** |  20   |  18  |  16   |  12   |  18   |  12   |  10   |  20   |   x   |  10   |   4   |
| **50818** |  13   |  15  |  18   |  17   |   9   |  15   |  13   |   9   |  10   |   x   |   4   |
| **48361** |   5   |   5  |   7   |   3   |   6   |   4   |   6   |   8   |   4   |   4   |   x   |

From the data in the table, it is evident that there is a high degree of duplicate outages among all sibling Autonomous Systems (ASNs) and, to some extent, between the sibling networks hosting malware and the upstream AS48361. When correlating these outage results with the earlier findings in Use Case 1, we can confirm a strong relationship between all the sibling ASNs. Not only do they share a common upstream provider, but there is also a significant overlap in network downtime, suggesting shared risk and infrastructure.

It is expected that when an upstream ASN experiences an outage, downstream networks will be affected, especially if they are single-homed and rely solely on this upstream provider for connectivity. However, our data shows several instances where the upstream provider had no outage, yet the downstream networks experienced hour-long outages with exact timeline overlaps.

These observations suggest that the set of autonomous systems likely relies on the same physical and routing infrastructure. While typically each ASN has its own infrastructure, our data indicates that these ASNs may be operated by the same organization or even run on the same hardware.

### Use Case 3: Rogue ASN De-Peered or Gone Stealth

In this section, we discuss the case of AS48031, which served various malware content, including browser-based ransomware, porn sites, spam, and radical forums. AS48031 had a single upstream provider, AS15626.

**Browser-Based Ransomware (Browlock)**

Browlock is a rudimentary form of ransomware that locks the browser screen using HTML or JavaScript code and demands payment, often under false pretenses such as possession of illegal material or usage of illegal software. Despite its simplicity, browlock has been profitable for criminals and has targeted several countries over the years.

**Prefixes Announced by AS48031 in Fall 2013**

- 176.103.48.0/20
- 193.169.86.0/23
- 193.203.48.0/22
- 193.30.244.0/22
- 194.15.112.0/22
- 196.47.100.0/24
- 91.207.60.0/23
- 91.213.8.0/24
- 91.217.90.0/23
- 91.226.212.0/23
- 91.228.68.0/22
- 93.170.48.0/22
- 94.154.112.0/20

In January 2014, AS48031 stopped advertising these prefixes and disappeared from the global BGP routing table. However, the prefixes did not vanish; instead, the upstream provider, AS15626, took over announcing them. The rogue IPs continued to host malware content.

This raises questions about whether AS15626 was complicit in hosting malware or if it acted responsibly by ceasing to announce the prefixes once it noticed the malicious content. There are several such suspicious cases in the BGP routing space.

### Use Case 4: Malicious Sub-Allocated Ranges

We conducted a study from October 2013 to February 2014, monitoring rogue sub-allocated ranges on OVH IP space, which were reserved by recurring suspicious customers and used to serve Nuclear Exploit kit domains. These infections occur through malvertising campaigns, leading visitors to exploit landing sites where malware is dropped onto victims' machines.

For several months, OVH IP ranges were abused, exclusively for hosting Nuclear Exploit subdomains. The bad actors moved to different hosting providers, including besthosting.ua and pinspb.ru, but kept the name server infrastructure on OVH. This allowed us to track them, and many active Nuclear Exploit domains were taken down with the help of the non-profit security research group, MalwareMustDie.

### Use Case 5: Predicting Malicious Domains IP Infrastructure

As part of the study, we monitored IP ranges reserved on OVH Canada by suspicious customers. The table below shows the number of reserved ranges, the total number of IPs, and the number of IPs used for malicious purposes during the specified periods.

**Table 12. IP Ranges Reserved by Suspicious Customers**

| Reservation Dates        | No. of Ranges | Total IPs | IPs Used for Malicious Purposes |
|--------------------------|---------------|-----------|---------------------------------|
| Dec 1st to 31st 2013     | 28            | 136       | 86                              |
| Jan 1st to 31st 2014     | 11            | 80        | 33                              |
| Feb 1st to 28th 2014     | 4             | 28        | 26                              |
| Mar 1st to 20th 2014     | 43            | 40        | 3                               |

These IPs were used to host Nuclear Exploit kit domains, name servers, and browlock domains. The bad actors have been circulating between OVH and other hosting providers, recently using compromised GoDaddy domains to host Nuclear and Angler Exploit kit domains.
