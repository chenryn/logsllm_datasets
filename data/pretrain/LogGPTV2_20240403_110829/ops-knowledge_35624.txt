Question: "Considering the process of validating SELinux policies, a developer wants to expedite the SELinux policy development by using a tool that takes `dmesg` denials and converts them into corresponding SELinux policy statements. They are considering `audit2allow` for this purpose. What is an advantage and a potential issue of using `audit2allow` for developing SELinux policies?"
 "A": "Advantage: It can quickly convert denial logs into policy statements. Potential issue: It might suggest overreaching permissions that could compromise security."
 "B": "Advantage: It can analyze the full call chain of denials including kernel and userspace. Potential issue: It requires a Linux kernel version higher than 5.10."
 "C": "Advantage: It prevents rate-limiting of SELinux error messages after boot complete. Potential issue: It may not support capturing boot time events."
 "D": "Advantage: It confirms enforcing mode is enabled through CTS tests. Potential issue: It cannot disable SELinux enforcement on production devices."
Answer: A
