User: I've setup an Amazon EC2 server. I have a Python script that is supposed to download large amounts of data from the web onto the server. I can run the script from the terminal through ssh, however very often I loose the ssh connection. When I loose the connection, the script stops.
Is there a method where I tell the script to run from terminal and when I disconnect, the script is still running on the server?
Assistant: You have a few options.

You can add your script to cron to be run regularly.
You can run your script manually, and detach+background it using nohup.
You can run a tool such as GNU Screen, and detach your terminal and log out, only to continue where you left off later. I use this a lot.

For example:

Log in to your machine, run: screen.
Start your script and either just close your terminal or properly detach your session with: Ctrl+A, D, D.
Disconnect from your terminal.
Reconnect at some later time, and run screen -rD. You should see your stuff just as you left it.


You can also add your script to /etc/rc.d/ to be invoked on book and always be running.
