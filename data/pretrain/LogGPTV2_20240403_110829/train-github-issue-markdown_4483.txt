Similar to issue #30765, consider the following example in Julia:

```julia
julia> a = collect(1.0:5.0)
5-element Vector{Float64}:
 1.0
 2.0
 3.0
 4.0
 5.0

julia> v = view(a, 3:-1:1)
3-element view(::Vector{Float64}, 3:-1:1) with eltype Float64:
 3.0
 2.0
 1.0

julia> BLAS.nrm2(v)
7.0710678118654755

julia> BLAS.nrm2(collect(v))
3.7416573867739413
```

In this example, we first create a vector `a` containing the elements from 1.0 to 5.0. We then create a view `v` of the first three elements of `a` in reverse order. The `BLAS.nrm2` function is used to compute the Euclidean norm (L2 norm) of both the view `v` and its collected version. The results show that the norm of the view and the norm of the collected view differ, highlighting the importance of understanding how views and collections are handled in computations.
