I am considering using Google App Engine (GAE) for a large-scale website. Given the scale, I would appreciate any advice you can provide on using GAE. I have heard that GAE has certain limitations, such as a 1MB file size limit for storing images and files (although this is reportedly going to change according to the GAE roadmap), and a query result limit of 1000. Additionally, I plan to use web2py with GAE. Could you share your thoughts on these considerations?

Thank you.

Hereâ€™s a refined response to your query:

Using web2py on Google App Engine (GAE) is a solid strategy. It allows you to quickly develop and deploy your application, and if you eventually outgrow GAE's limitations, you can easily migrate your web2py application to another platform.

However, to maintain this portability, it's advisable to avoid using GAE-specific advanced features such as Task Queues, Transactions, and ListProperty. Sticking to more generic and portable components will make it easier to transition to a different hosting environment in the future.

If you have specific requirements that might push against these limitations, it may be worth evaluating other cloud platforms or services that offer more flexibility and scalability. 

Best of luck with your project!
