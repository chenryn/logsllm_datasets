# Bug report
Unable to navigate to another route when using `@zeit/next-sass` in version
`8.0.4`.
## To Reproduce
On clicking the link from index page, it doesn't route to about page(when
using `@zeit/next-sass`). But after removing (`@zeit/next-sass`), it works as
expected.
This unusual behaviour happens on client side. When going directly to the
about page, it works but still navigation does not work on client side.
`/pages/index.js`
    import Link from "next/link";
    const Index = () => (
          About Page
        Hello Next.js
    );
    export default Index;
`/pages/about.js`
    import "../styles/about.scss";
    function About() {
      return (
          This is the about page
      );
    }
    export default About;
`styles/about.scss`
    $font-size: 50px;
    .about {
        font-size: $font-size;
    }
`next.config.js`
    const withSass = require("@zeit/next-sass");
    module.exports = withSass();
## Expected behavior
It should be able to route to about page from index page on client side.
## System information
