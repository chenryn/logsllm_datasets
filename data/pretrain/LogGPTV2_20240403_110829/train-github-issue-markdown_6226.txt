## Bug Report

### I would like to work on a fix!

#### Current Behavior
I have a `.browserslistrc` file that contains the `defaults` query. I do not have the `targets` option defined in the `babel-preset-env` configuration. With this setup, the preset includes 148 `core-js` imports.

If I change the setup and define the `targets` option as `defaults`, I would expect the output to be the same. However, the preset now includes only 129 `core-js` imports.

Note that this discrepancy occurs only with the `defaults` query. If I target, for example, `Chrome 75`, both setups produce the same result.

#### Input Code
You can find the code and configurations in the following repository:
- [bug-babel-preset-env](https://github.com/htulipe/bug-babel-preset-env)

In the `lib` directory, you will find two compiled files: one without the `targets` option and another with the `targets` option defined.

#### Expected Behavior
I expect that defining `defaults` in the `.browserslistrc` file or in the `babel-preset-env` options should produce the same result.

#### Babel Configuration
Please refer to the sample repository for the Babel configuration files:
- `babel.config.js`
- `.babelrc`
- `package.json#babel`
- CLI command
- `.eslintrc`
