## Bug Report
  * I would like to work on a fix!
**Current Behavior**  
I have a `. browserlistrc` file that contains the `defaults` query. I don't
have `targets` option defined in babel-preset-env options. With that setup,
the preset includes 148 core-js imports.
If I change this setup and define the `targets` option to `defaults` I would
expect the output to be the same. It is not. The preset includes 129 core-js
imports.
Note that this happens only with the `defaults` query. If I target for
instance `Chrome 75`, both setups work the same.
**Input Code**  
See:  
https://github.com/htulipe/bug-babel-preset-env
In `lib` you'll find a file compiled without the `targets` option and another
with the option defined.
**Expected behavior/code**
I would expect that defining `defaults` in .browserslistrc or in the preset
options to ouput the same result.
**Babel Configuration (babel.config.js, .babelrc, package.json#babel, cli
command, .eslintrc)**
