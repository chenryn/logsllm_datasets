Figure 6.1: Simple star wireless topology
To best utilize and protect this wireless environment, you need to understand how it works. If you can control electromagnetic waves, you can use them to communicate. Information is sent from one component called a transmitter and picked up by another called a receiver. The transmitter sends electrical signals through an antenna to create waves that spread outward. The receiver with another antenna in the path of those waves picks up the signal and amplifies it so it can be processed. A wireless router is simply a router that uses radio waves instead of cables. It contains a low‐power radio transmitter and receiver, with a range of about 90 meters or 300 feet, depending on what your walls are made of. The router can send and receive Internet data to any computer in your environment that is also equipped with wireless access. Each computer on the wireless network has to have a transmitter and receiver in it as well. A router becomes an access point for the Internet, creating an invisible “cloud” of wireless connectivity called as a hotspot.
There are advantages and disadvantages to communicating wirelessly. Networks are pretty easy to set up and rather inexpensive, with several choices of frequencies to communicate over. Disadvantages can include keeping this communication secure, the range of the wireless devices, reliability, and, of course, speed. The transmitter and the receiver need to be on the same frequency, and each 802.11 standard has its own set of pros and cons. Table 6.1 describes the IEEE 802.11 standards for wireless devices. As with any technology, wireless devices have evolved to become faster with more range depending on the standard. 802.11ac is sometimes referred to as Wi‐Fi 5 and is what most current wireless routers are compliant with. These devices will have multiple antennas to send and receive data reducing errors and boosting speed. There is a new Wi‐Fi technology coming in the near future called 802.11ax or Wi‐Fi 6. 802.11ax will be anywhere from four to ten times faster than existing Wi‐Fi with wider channels available and promises to be less congested and improve battery life on mobile devices since data is transmitted faster.

As with any technology, as it evolves, you will start making decisions on what scenario is best for you and your organization. There may be trade‐offs on frequency used, speed, or the range of a device from a Wi‐Fi hotspot. A hotspot is merely an area with an accessible network.
When building a typical wireless small office or home office (SOHO) environment, after you identify what technology and design is best for your situation, you configure the settings of your router using a web interface. You can select the name of the network you want to use, known as the service set identifier (SSID). You can choose the channel. By default, most routers use channel 6 or 11. You will also choose security options, such as setting up your own username and password as well as encryption.
As a best practice, when you configure security settings on your router, choose Wi‐Fi Protected Access version 2 (WPA2). WPA2 is the recommended security standard for Wi‐Fi networks. It can use either TKIP or AES encryption, depending on the choices you make during setup. AES is considered more secure.
Another best practice is configuring MAC filtering on your router. This doesn't use a password to authenticate. It uses the MAC address of the device itself. Each device that connects to a router has its own MAC address. You can specify which MAC addresses are allowed on your network as well as set limitations to how many devices can join your network. If you set up your router to use MAC filtering, one drawback is every time you need to add a device, you have to grant network permission. You sacrifice convenience for better protection. After reading this book, the more advanced user will know how to capture packets, examine the data, and possibly identify the MAC address of a device in the list of permitted devices. MAC filtering with WPA2 encryption will be the best way to protect your data.
inSSIDer
One of my favorite tools is called inSSIDer by MetaGeek. inSSIDer is a wireless network scanner. It was meant to replace NetStumbler, which was a Microsoft Windows Wi‐Fi scanner. There is a free version with limited features called inSSIDer Lite, and you can download it from https://www.metageek.com/products/inssider/free/.
inSSIDer intercepts information from wireless devices and will report all of the wireless networks that are nearby. It will report details such as the SSID of the WAP and what channels the device is using, as well as signal strength, the physical type of the WAP, if it's secured, and the minimum/maximum data rate. You also get a graph of the WAPs divided up by channels 2.4 and 5 GHz. In Figure 6.2, you see that inSSIDer Lite captures the SSID of the broadcasting router, channel, signal, 802.11 type, and kind of security that is being used as well as minimum and maximum data rates.
Figure 6.2: inSSIDer capture of Wi‐Fi
If you know what is happening around you, you can use this data to fix problems you might be having or improve your network performance. Most people will use inSSIDer to pick the best channel that no one else is using for the best reception and no interference. You can check to see whether your network is secure and what other networks have been discovered.
If there is a lot of traffic on wireless devices around you, you will see this displayed in the visualizations of what channel each access point is on. They can overlap and basically compete for airspace. Using inSSIDer, you can make sure your router is using the best channel. Looking at Figure 6.2, notice that there is a router in the 5 GHz channel all the way over to the right that is not sharing airspace with anyone. Yes, that's me.
One issue everyone experiences from time to time are dead spots. They are one of the most common pain points of Wi‐Fi technology. Depending on which version of inSSIDer you use, there is an option to change from Physical to Logical mode. If you change to Physical mode, you can walk around your work or home environment to evaluate whether your router is in the correct spot. If signal strength dips below ‐70 dBm, you have a weak area. If it falls below ‐80 dBm, you have a dead spot.
Wireless Network Watcher
inSSIDer will help you manage the wireless connections around you for a stable, reliable connection. Now that you have that stable connection, you may want to monitor who else is attached to the network you are connected to. Wireless Network Watcher by NirSoft is a small program that scans the wireless network you are attached to and displays the list of all computers and devices that are connected to the same network. You can download the latest version from https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/wireless_network_watcher.html.
For every computer or network device attached, you will see the IP address, the MAC address, the company that manufactured the network interface card, and the computer name. You can take that list and export the connected devices into an HTML, XML, CSV, or TXT file. You can even copy the list and paste it into Excel or another spreadsheet application where you can use tools to list, sort, and pivot the information depending on the volume of data.
This program works well when hosted on a Windows machine but can find other platforms such as Linux or Cisco. Wireless Network Watcher will only find assets connected to the network you are currently connected to, not other wireless networks. In some cases, if your network adapter is not found, you can go to Advanced Options and choose the correct network adapter. Under the View tab, you can add gridlines or shaded odd/even rows. If you're actively monitoring the status of your wireless networks, you can even have the program beep when a new device is found. Figure 6.3 shows a list of IP addresses, the device name, MAC address, and other information including whether the device is active on the current network.

Hamachi
Hamachi by LogMeIn is a cloud‐based, professional‐level application that allows you to easily create a virtual private network (VPN) in minutes. A VPN seems complicated, but Hamachi is not. Unlike traditional software‐based VPNs, Hamachi is on‐demand, giving you secure access remotely to your business anywhere you have an Internet connection. Without protection, the information you send will be out in the open, and anyone interested in intercepting your data can capture it. Figure 6.4 shows an example of a laptop sending an email using VPN to secure transmission over the Internet.
Figure 6.4: Securing the transmission of data using a VPN
Based on the fact that you are reading this book, I would probably bet you are the tech support for your friends and family. I've used Hamachi to help friends who are not technically savvy to install printers, troubleshoot issues, and share files and games with other friends around the globe. If you have remote computers that you would like to access, this software gives you access to that remote machine, imitating a local area network.
Using Hamachi, you can add friends, family, and mobile employees to a virtual network where you share resources. Your foundational network configuration does not change. With the VPN connection, information you send to your bank, business email, or other sensitive data is protected. When you use a VPN service, the data is encrypted when it gets to the Internet. The destination site sees the VPN server as the origin of the data. It is extremely difficult to identify the source of the data, what websites you visit, or money you are transferring. The data is encrypted, so even if it is intercepted, no one gets the raw data.
To use Hamachi to create a VPN, you must first download the executable file that will allow you to be a client. The term client refers to both the software and any device you've installed the software on. With the correct permission, your client can become a member of any network. The client can be used only with a LogMeIn ID that you create as part of your LogMeIn account when you open and power up the client for the first time. There is no obligation and no credit card required. This ID provides a single sign‐on login experience. Once you're logged in to Hamachi, as you see in Figure 6.5, you have your IPv4 and IPv6 address.
Figure 6.5: Hamachi VPN management console
Every client will have one IPv4 address in the 25.X.X.X range and one IPv6 address. This virtual IP address is globally unique and is used to access any other Hamachi network. As shown in Figure 6.6, when you set up your network, you will have an option to choose Mesh, Hub‐And‐Spoke, or Gateway.
Figure 6.6: Hamachi network type options
In a meshed network, every single member of the network is connected to every other member, which makes it easier to relay data. A mesh topology can handle high amounts of network traffic since every device is considered a node. Interconnected devices can transfer data at the same time, and data moves smoothly, which makes this an ideal choice for gaming. The hub‐and‐spoke topology provides more control than the meshed network topology. Hubs are connected to everyone, and you have spokes connected to hubs but not to each other. This is a typical choice for a corporate environment where you have workstations connecting to a server. A gateway network will integrate well with a physical network, giving members access to the physical network. There will be only one gateway, and there can many members.
You must sign up for a free account with LogMeIn to complete the install process, and you will need an email address. When you register, you have improved network management, administration, and the ability to create networks. When you have entered an email and password, you will need to create a client‐owned network. This will include a unique network ID and password so you can manage your new VPN. This peer‐to‐peer VPN is using AES 256‐bit encryption to secure your data. You can share the network ID with up to five people for free, and they can install the client, use the network ID you created, and join your network. If you need more than five members per network, you may want to look at standard or premium packages.
LogMeIn has been tested with many operating systems, and the most current version supports the following:
Windows Vista (all versions)
Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard, Business Editions
Windows 7, 8.1, and 10
Windows Server 2012
Mac OS 10.6 (Snow Leopard) and above
Ubuntu 16.04 and above
CentOS 7.2 and above
Depending on the topology you have chosen, keep in mind that you cannot assign the Gateway Node functionality to a Mac or Small Business Server.
LAB 6.1: INSTALLING AND USING HAMACHI
On the LogMeIn website, you will you see the download link that attaches your networks to your login only after you have created a user account and logged in. If you attempt to download the client without being signed in, any network you create will be unable to be joined by anyone else but you.
In the menu on the left in Figure 6.7, there's a Networks menu item. Click Add Clients, and your options will be to install the software on your current machine or a remote machine or add this client to a mobile device. Leave the default of adding LogMeIn Hamachi on this computer and click Continue.
Figure 6.7: LogMeIn Hamachi client menu
Click the Download Now button to allow the installer to download, and follow all the setup wizard's on‐screen instructions. You're now ready to configure your first network.
NOTE
The welcome screen will show you which LogMeIn Account this client will be attached to.
LAB 6.2: CREATING A CLIENT‐OWNED NETWORK
From the LogMeIn Hamachi menu in Figure 6.5, click Network and then Create Network.
As you see in Figure 6.8, create a unique network ID. This is the ID that others will use to join your network. An error message will be displayed if the network ID you've entered is already taken.
Figure 6.8: Creating a new client network
Choose and confirm a password that others will use to access your network.
Click Create. The new network will appear in your client.
LAB 6.3: CREATING A MANAGED NETWORK
From the LogMeIn website, sign in with your ID.
From the menu on the left in Figure 6.9, choose My Networks.
Figure 6.9: Creating a managed network
Click Add Network. Choose a network name, description, and type, and then click Continue. After you click Continue, you cannot change the network type—you will have to delete it.
You have an option to accept or approve join requests as well as give the network a password.
Click Continue.
If you chose the hub‐and‐spoke topology, you will now choose the computer that will act as the hub, as shown in Figure 6.10. If you chose a gateway topology, choose the computer that will act as the gateway computer. The gateway computer cannot be a member of any other VPN. It is typically a server on the physical network. You can change the gateway at any time.
Figure 6.10: Selecting the hub for your network
Under Add Network, step 3, you select the hub for your network. Click Continue, and on the next screen, step 4, choose the spokes of your network and then click Finish.
To join a network that has been created by someone else, from the Hamachi client, go to Network ➪ Join Network. You will need to know the network ID and the password if one was added.
One of the tools inside the Hamachi web interface gives you the ability to manage computers, files, and users and run reports on sessions occurring in the last 30 days. Under Computers in your web browser, you can add different computers by opening the Computers page and click Add Computer. To add the computer you're sitting at, just download the installer and follow the on‐screen instructions to download and install LogMeIn. To add a computer other than the one you are using, click Add Different Computer ➪ Generate Link. Follow the on‐screen instructions, but be aware this link does expire after 24 hours. This is where others can download and install the software for the client. With the Files menu, you can upload files, share links, and connect storage space for easy access. Figure 6.11 shows the Users section where you can choose to add users to an account and select which computers you want them to have access to.

Tor
The more you learn about cybersecurity, the more paranoid you may seem to those who do not understand the interworking of the Internet. Monitoring of traffic on the Internet is widespread, and there are many organizations, including governments, corporations, and criminals, that can monitor your traffic covertly. In 2003, a program called Total/Terrorism Information Awareness was established by the United States Information Awareness Office to gather detailed information about individuals in an attempt to prevent crimes before they happened. They called this predictive policing.
Many civil rights organizations and privacy groups like Reporters Without Borders and the American Civil Liberties Union have expressed concern that with ever‐increasing surveillance, we will end up with limited political or personal freedoms. There are hacktivist organizations such as Anonymous, Lizard Squad, Morpho, and APT28 that all have their own modus operandi and moral code.
Edward Snowden, whether you believe what he did was right or wrong, showed us how the NSA is using tailored access operation (TAO) to compromise common computer systems and force companies to purposefully insert vulnerabilities into their own systems for TAO to exploit. An example of this is WARRIOR PRIDE, which is iPhone and Android software that can turn on a phone remotely, turn on the microphone, and activate geolocation. The modules of this kit have cartoon names, including Dreamy Smurf, which handles power management; Nosey Smurf, which can turn on the microphone; and Tracker Smurf, which turns on high‐precision geolocation.
According to www.statistica.com, Google had more than 2 billion users in 2017. There are a little more than 7 billion people on the planet. One of the first things I do when teaching a Metasploit class or an open‐source intelligence (OSINT) class is to have my students Google themselves. When you get to the My Activity page in Google, depending on your privacy settings, you'll see a timeline of activity, websites you've visited, and images you've viewed. Have you ever had a conversation with a friend and the very next ad you see on your PC or your phone is in direct correlation to the conversation you had?
Tor (also called The Onion Router) is the answer to much of this. Tor is a network that enables you to stay anonymous on the Internet. Tor is based on “onion routing” developed at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory and was launched in 2002. The Tor Project (www.torproject.org) is a nonprofit organization that currently maintains and develops the free Tor Browser client. The U.S. government funds it with some support by the Swedish government and some individual contributors.
Is Tor illegal? No. Is engaging in activities that are illegal in your country on Tor illegal? Yes.
Some cyber professionals believe that using Incognito mode in Chrome is the same thing as running Tor. Browsing the Internet in Incognito mode only keeps the browser from saving your history, cookies, or form data. It does not hide your browsing from your ISP, employer, spouse, or the NSA. To activate Incognito mode in a Chrome browser, press the Ctrl+Shift+N. In Figure 6.12, you see Chrome in Incognito mode.
Figure 6.12: Chrome in Incognito mode
By contrast, Tor reduces the risk of traffic analysis by distributing it so that no single point can link you to your destination. To create a private network path, the users of the Tor Browser client will incrementally build a circuit of encrypted connections through different relays on the network. In Figure 6.13, you see the route that data takes from your Tor Browser client to the destination. The circuit is built one hop at a time so that each relay only knows to whom it's giving data and where it is sending that data. No individual relay knows the entire path. For security, after 10 minutes, a new circuit is created to keep anyone from attempting to figure out the path through the nodes.
Figure 6.13: Tor routing data for anonymity
To use the Tor Browser client, download the install file from www.torproject.org, run the setup program, choose your desired language, choose a destination folder (I usually choose the Desktop), and click Install.
Open your Tor folder and double‐click the Tor Browser client. You will have an option to configure the tool to work with a proxy. Click the Connect button to create the first encrypted relay and open the tool. If you are used to a quick response, you may need to take a deep breath. Because of the architecture of Tor, be prepared for slight delays. It's the exchange you make for privacy. In Figure 6.14, you see the default search engine that Tor uses is DuckDuckGo, layering even more protection of your privacy.
Figure 6.14: DuckDuckGo browser
Now you have end‐to‐end protection for your wireless communications. You know which networks around you are encrypted; what assets are on your network; which users, devices, and data you're sharing on your virtual private network; and that your browser cannot be traced.

Wireshark
My first real experience using Wireshark was in a forensics class with Sherri Davidoff, CEO of LMG Security. Sherri walked us through many tools to investigate a case study where money had been stolen. Wireshark was the tool we kept returning to time and time again to prove what had been planned and executed, and eventually we were able to prove who the threat actors were.
Wireshark is a tool that every network or security administrator should know. It is an open‐source tool used for capturing network traffic and analyzing packets at an extremely granular level. Sometimes Wireshark is called a network analyzer or a sniffer. Packet capturing can tell you about transmit time, source, destination, and protocol type. This can be critical information for evaluating events that are happening or troubleshooting devices across your network. It can also help a security analyst determine whether network traffic is a malicious attack, what type of attack, the IP addresses that were targeted, and where the attack originated from. As a result, you will be able to create rules on a firewall to block the IP addresses where the malicious traffic originated.
Wireshark shows packet details captured from different network media, breaking down the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model into the data link, network, transport, and application layers. At the bottom of the workspace, you have an option to open the hexadecimal with corresponding ASCII values on the right.
Wireshark is a powerful tool and technically can be used for eavesdropping. When you plan to use this in a business environment, you will want to get written permission to use it and make sure your organization has a clearly defined security privacy policy that specifies the rights of individuals using the network. Stories abound of network administrators capturing usernames, passwords, email addresses, and other sensitive user data. Wireshark is legal to use, but it can become illegal if you attempt to monitor a network that you do not have explicit authorization to monitor.
Determining the resources that Wireshark needs depends on the size of the .pcap file you are examining. If you have a busy network, then the files will be large. Wireshark can run on Windows and Linux machines. You will need a supported network card for capturing data, such as an Ethernet card or a wireless adapter. To get the latest copy of Wireshark, visit www.wireshark.org. The download page will have the proper version for your computers architecture and version operating system. A new version typically comes out every other month.
To install Wireshark, double‐check the name of the file you have downloaded. If you have downloaded Wireshark‐win64‐2.6.4.exe, you will be installing Wireshark 2.6.4 for Windows 64‐bit architecture. The download will include WinPcap, which allows you to capture live network traffic, not just examine saved packet captures (.pcap files).
Once you have installed the Wireshark executable, you will see the list of the different network interfaces that are functioning on the device as well as a graph to the right of current network activity on each interface. It reminds me of an electrocardiogram (EKG) that measures heart rhythms. As you see in Figure 7.1, if you have peaks and valleys, then you have traffic on that interface. If the line is flat, then that interface is not active.
Figure 7.1: Choosing a network interface card for capture
When you double‐click a network interface that is displaying activity, the main window will open to display all the traffic on that network. The major components of this page include the menu; the packet list, details, and bytes panes; and the status bar at the bottom, which can give you a great deal of detail regarding your capture.
The packet list pane is located in the top third of the window and by default shares information from the headers of each packet captured. Summary information includes source IP address, destination IP address, protocol in use, length of the packet, and information about the packet. By clicking the individual packets, you control what is shown in the bottom two panes. To drill down into each packet, select the packet in the packet list pane to view more details in the middle window, which feeds data into the bottom window.
In the packet details pane, you see individual packet size, both on the wire and bytes captured. You also see the transmission medium, protocol, source port, and destination port, and then depending on the type of packet, you may see flags or queries. You can click the > sign on the left to reveal different levels of detail about each packet in human‐readable language.
At the bottom is a packet bytes pane. This displays data in hexadecimal code, which makes up the actual digital contents of the packet. It highlights the field selected above in the packet details pane. When you click any line in the middle pane, the hexadecimal code at bottom will be highlighted, giving you an extremely granular view of the data such as a URL that someone visited or contents of an email that was sent.
