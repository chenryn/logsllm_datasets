ABSTRACT
The Internet of services introduces new requirements for service engineering in terms of addressing
both business and technical perspectives. The inherent complexity of the new wave of services that is
emerging requires new approaches for an effective and efficient service design. In this chapter a novel
service engineering framework is introduced: the Integrated Service Engineering (ISE) framework. With
its ISE workbench, it can address the emerging requirements of Internet of services. The chapter presents
the foundations on how the service engineering process can be conducted by applying the separation of
concerns to model different service dimensions within various layers of abstraction. Additionally, three
novel extensions are presented to the aforementioned ISE workbench in order to enrich the capabilities
of the service modeling process.
