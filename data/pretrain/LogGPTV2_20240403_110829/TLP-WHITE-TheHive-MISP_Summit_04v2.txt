## MISP, TheHive & Cortex: Better, Faster, Happier

### Overview
#### TheHive Project
| Goals | How | What (Tools) |
|-------|-----|--------------|
| Reduce Detection and Response Time | Alert/Event Collection | Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) |
| Contribute to the Community | Automation | Incident Response |
| Enhance Collaboration | Digital Forensics | Collaboration Tools |

#### What (Take Two)
| Libraries | Who | Since When |
|-----------|-----|------------|
| Core Libraries | TheHive Core Team (6 Members) | AGPL v3, Oct 2014 (Private Version) |
| Core Libraries | TheHive Core Team (6 Members) | AGPL v3, Nov 2016 (FLOSS) |
| Synapse | Large Community (SOC/CSIRT/CERT) | AGPL v3, Feb 2017 (Cortex) |

### Key Features
- **SIRP/SOAR**: Real-time collaboration.
- **Customizable Dashboards**: Track activity and follow KPIs.
- **Cortex Integration**: At-scale analysis and active response.
- **MISP Integration**: CTI functions.
- **Authentication Methods**: LDAP, AD, OAuth 2, API keys, etc.
- **Webhook Support**: Observable analysis and active response engine.
- **Analyzer Capabilities**: Use the Web UI or REST API, write custom analyzers in Python or other languages.
- **MISP Integration**: Import from or export to multiple MISP instances, tightly integrated with Cortex for indicator enrichment.

### TheHive and MISP
- **Threat Sharing**: De facto standard for threat sharing.
- **CTI Functions**: Collection, sanitization, and dissemination of intelligence.
- **Correlation and Storage**: Supports tagging, galaxies, objects, taxonomies such as ATT&CK, and more.
- **Automation**: Highly automated processes.

### Workflow
| Case Template | User | Admin/Audit |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| Case Template | Case | Alert/MISP Event |
| Responder | Task | Observable |
| Analyzer | Action | Log |
| Analysis Report | Job | Report Template |
| Task Groups | Integration | Feeders |

### Integration
| Alert/Case Sources | SIEM, Email, CTI Provider | Feeders |
|-------------------|--------------------------|---------|
| Raise Alerts | Open Cases | Security Incident Response Platform |

### Events and Analysis
- **MISP and TheHive**: Default interval is 1 hour. Ensure cases are not merged.
- **MISP Event Updates**: New observables are added when new attributes are added to the MISP event.
- **IOC Sharing**: Only flagged IOCs can be shared back to the MISP event.
- **Sync User**: If different organizations, TheHive will create a new instance.
- **Multiple Instances**: Create as many instances as needed.

### Extended Events
- **Connection Health Monitoring**: TheHive monitors the health of MISP and Cortex connections.
- **Custom MISP Settings**: Tailor settings in TheHive, including max attributes per event, publication date, org blacklist, tag blacklist, and max JSON size.

### Future Developments
- **CERANA 2 (TheHive 3.2)** ~ Q4 2018: Share sightings with MISP, organization and tag whitelisting.
- **CARNICA 2 (TheHive 4.1)** ~ Q2 2019: Add support for MISP objects.
- **CARNICA 3 (TheHive 4.3)** ~ Q3 2019: Add taxonomy support using MISP.
