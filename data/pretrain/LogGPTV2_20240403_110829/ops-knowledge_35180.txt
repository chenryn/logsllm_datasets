Question: A company uses a webmail application that interacts with internal mail servers using the IMAP/SMTP protocols. The internal mail servers are not directly accessible from the internet and are presumed to have less rigorous security measures compared to the front-end servers. As a security consultant, you are tasked with assessing potential vulnerabilities. Which of the following actions should you prioritize to evaluate the security of this setup effectively?
"A": "Conduct a penetration test to inject arbitrary IMAP/SMTP commands to check if input data is properly sanitized.",
"B": "Focus solely on the security of the front-end web servers since they are the first line of defense.",
"C": "Restrict the assessment to the exploitation of known IMAP/SMTP protocol vulnerabilities exclusively.",
"D": "Implement anti-automation processes to prevent any form of injection attacks."
Answer: A
