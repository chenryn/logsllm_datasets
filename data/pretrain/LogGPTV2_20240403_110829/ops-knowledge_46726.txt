User: Let's say I had a cloud cluster with Python or C or something and I want to execute my function (as a client) in the cloud.  How could I possibly pass the function I wrote locally up to the server?
I've seen this elsewhere and I not only don't know how to do it but I want to see if there are many ideas for it.
Thanks,

Assistant: Well if you wrote it locally you probably wont be executing anything that require compilation in realtime (I assume your looking for efficiency and will be exchanging a whole series of computations in the cloud) which in that case you looking to send it something like a ruby file on the fly?
But that doesn't seem very practical since you really aren't going to get this newly written function coming from the client side sent over and scaled well across the cluster you are sending it to.
That being said, set something up where you can send functions perimeters in the form of xml, json, etc. Use an http connection or an https if you need it secure and build it using hadoop, mpi, et.
