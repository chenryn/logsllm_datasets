– label of provider or integrator. However, for a compliant orchestration every
Action a Service constitutes, we want to know the detailed Actor roles and
responsibilities, as well as the required Competencies. To this end, an Oper-
ant Resource acting in a Service plays the role of a designated Actor role
that comes along with a permission to perform certain Actions. We adopt an
SVBR-featured deontic rule to define a permission.
– Actor is a Operant Resource;
– It is permitted that Actor acts in Action.
We can adopt the widely-used RACI roles to define specific responsibility
assignment and devise four relationships accordingly:
– Actor responsible for Action; Actor accountablefor Action;
– Actor is consulted about Action ; Actor informed of Action.
These relationships may imply certain combinations of the earlier introduced
permissions. We could further exclude combinations of role and actor can play
in the context of a specific action using the following SBVR syntax.
– No Actor is responsible for and is consulted about the same Action.
Or we could state implications of roles for the sake of inferencing:
– It is always true that an Actor is informed of Action if the Actor
is responsible for that Action.
Competency A Competency is modeled as a special type of Operand Re-
source controlled by an Individual. The HR-XML consortium proposed to
model a Reusable Competency Definition (RCD) as: “a specific, identifi-
able,definable,andmeasurableknowledge,skill,abilityand/orotherdeployment-
relatedcharacteristic(e.g.attitude,behavior,physicalability)whichahumanre-
source may possess and which is necessary for, or material to, the performance
of an activity within a specific business context”14. Hence, we devise following
concept types:
– Competency is a Operand Resource
– Attitude ; Knowledge ; Skill ; Learning Objective is a Compe-
tency

System); and finally, WZ2003 (Classification of Industry Sector) which is the
German classification for economic activities.

6.2 Application of the Ontology
Wedemonstratethethemodelingofbusinesssemanticsinthecontextofservice-
oriented Information Governance. We have implemented these applications in
Collibra’s Business Semantics Glossary product.
Modelling Service System Perspectives SBVR and BSM acknowledges
the existence of multiple perspectives on how to represent concepts (by means
of vocabularies), and includes the modelling of a governance model to reconcile
theseperspectives(insofarpracticallynecessary)inordertocometoanontology
that is agreed and shared (by means of communities and speech communities)
[5].
– A semantic community (itself an Organisation) groups Organisations
and controls a shared body of business service semantics. Domain concepts
are identified by a URI.
– A speech community is a subset of Organisations from a semantic com-
munity that control a set of vocabulary Resources to refer to this body of
shared meanings.
– A vocabulary is a meaningful grouping of lexical Resources (e.g., noun
types, fact types and rules primarily drawn from a single natural language
or jargon) to represent conceptions within a body of shared semantics.
The participation of Individuals in the governance of the vocabulary con-
trolled by their Organisation is contrained by specific governance services.
The latter are defined – as domain specialisations of our upper-level mode – by
assigning Actor roles to Individuals for certain actions on these Lexical
Resources.
Dynamic Actor Type Management Types of Actor can be dynamically
defined as a noun concept with a gloss in a designated Actor Vocabulary.
For example, consider:
– Business Steward is a Actor
where the term is mapped on the following gloss articulating the term for this
role: “expert in a certain business unit or line of business”. Responsibility can
be assigned to Actor type definitions as follows:
– It is permitted that Business Steward acts in AddNounConcept;
whereAddNounConceptisa Action;oneofthemanythatcanbeperformed
on vocabulary Resources.
Assigning Individuals to Actor Types BasedontheirCompetency,Indi-
viduals are assigned to an Actor type; permitting or obligating them to play
a role in a certain Action. The following screenshot shows an assignment of a
role is done for the business semantics management of a service called “Data
Governance Council” in a a financial service company.

for a “DG Council” service. This implies a number of permittable Actions on the
vocabulary’s constituents.
7 Discussion and Conclusion
We proposed a method for ontological representation and governance of busi-
ness service semantics. Currently, no commercial tool, aside from the prototype
in Collibra’s Business Semantics Glossary used to demonstrate the feasibility of
our solution, exists. Hence, we find our effort in this work as paving the road
towards the development of improved service-integration tools that are better
equipped to facilitate inter-silos communication. The next step is to investigate
the automatic configuration of roles and responsibilities along peers in mod-
ellingqualityandcomplianceoftheirservicesby,i.a.,matchingcompetencyand
reputation profiles, based on earlier work [7].
We will validate our approach in the Flanders research Information Space
(FRIS) case study [16]. FRIS is a knowledge-intensive community of interest
for two main reasons. First, it exhibits participatory characteristics that are
typicaltoopennetworks.Theactorsareinter-dependentyethighlyautonomous,
heterogeneous, and distributed; including research institutes, funding agencies,
patentofficesandindustrialadopters.TheFRIScommunityhasaminimumlevel
ofgovernance.The FlemishPublic Administrationhas limitedmeans toenforce
information quality and compliance requirements on its FRIS peers; hence a
high level of trust is assumed. Yet they inter-dependency on value creation is a
main incentive. Secondly, the FRIS information space15 itself is a true product
of open value cocreation. FRIS publishes information about innovation-related
entitiessuchasresearchers,projects,proposals,publications,andpatentsthatis

nizations and 17096 researchers: http://researchportal.be/
Data) sources as we demonstrated earlier in [8]. This will make the discussion
of quality and compliance even more complicated.
