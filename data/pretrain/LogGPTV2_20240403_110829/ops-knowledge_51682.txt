Question: "An engineer is developing a new component that will be deployed on an application server. The component needs to handle resources such as database connections and file streams. Which of the following approaches to resource management should the engineer consider to ensure proper runtime resource management, and what are the potential drawbacks of not following the best practice?"
 "A": "Utilize the application server's API for resource management to leverage built-in optimizations and avoid conflicts with the server's resource handling mechanisms."
 "B": "Directly employ low-level functions/methods for resource management to have granular control over the resources and their lifecycle."
 "C": "Rely on the garbage collection provided by the programming language runtime to automatically manage all resources."
 "D": "Outsource resource management to a third-party library to reduce development effort and focus on business logic."
Answer: A
