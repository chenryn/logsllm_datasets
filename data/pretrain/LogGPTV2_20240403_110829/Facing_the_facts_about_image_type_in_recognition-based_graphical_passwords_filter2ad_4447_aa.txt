Abstract—Numerous graphical password schemes have re-
cently been proposed as alternatives to traditional text pass-
word authentication. We provide a comprehensive overview of
published research in the area, covering both usability and
security aspects, as well as system evaluation. The paper ﬁrst
catalogues existing approaches, highlighting novel features of
selected schemes and identifying key usability or security ad-
vantages. We then review usability requirements for knowledge-
based authentication as they apply to graphical passwords,
identify security threats that such systems should address, review
methodological issues related to empirical evaluation, and identify
areas for further research and improved methodology.
Index Terms—Computer security, access control, user inter-
face, human factors.
I. INTRODUCTION
Beginning around 1999, numerous graphical password
schemes have been proposed, motivated by the promise of
improved password memorability and thus usability, while at
the same time improving strength against guessing attacks.
Like text passwords, graphical passwords are knowledge-based
authentication mechanisms where users enter a shared secret
as evidence of their identity. However, where text passwords
involve alphanumeric and/or special keyboard characters, the
idea behind graphical passwords is to leverage human memory
for visual information, with the shared secret being related to
or composed of images, parts of images, or sketches.
Despite the large number of options for authentication,
text passwords remain the most common choice for several
reasons [2], [3]. For example, they are easy and inexpensive
to implement; are familiar to essentially all users; allow users
to authenticate themselves while avoiding privacy issues that
have been raised about biometrics; and have the advantage
of portability without, for example, having to carry physical
tokens. However, text passwords also suffer from both security
and usability disadvantages — for example, passwords are
typically difﬁcult to remember, and are predictable if user-
choice is allowed [4]–[8].
When text password users adopt unsafe coping strategies
[9]–[11], such as reusing passwords across accounts to help
with memorability, the resulting decrease in security cannot be
successfully addressed by simply strengthening, in isolation,
the underlying technical security aspects of a system. Usability
issues often signiﬁcantly impact the real-world security of the
system. User interface design decisions may unintentionally

sway user behaviour, often towards less secure behaviour.
Successful authentication solutions must
thus also include
improved usability design based on appropriate research taking
into account the abilities and limitations of the target users. In
graphical passwords, human memory for visual information
is leveraged in hope of a reduced memory burden that will
facilitate the selection and use of more secure (e.g., longer or
more complex) passwords, precluding users from resorting to
unsafe coping practices.
Surveys of graphical passwords circa 2005 are available
from Suo et al. [10] and Monrose and Reiter [9]. More
recently, Haﬁz et al. [12] brieﬂy summarize and categorize 12
schemes. Renaud [13] reviews numerous graphical password
systems and offers usability guidelines for their design.
In this paper we provide a comprehensive review of the ﬁrst
ten years of published research on graphical passwords, and
reﬂect on it. Reﬂection clearly shows that the graphical nature
of schemes does not by itself avoid the problems typical of
text password systems. However, while this ﬁrst generation of
graphical password schemes presents some familiar problems,
we see an emerging second generation beginning to leverage
the graphical elements in new ways to avoid the old problems.
We begin with an overview classifying schemes into three
main categories — based on recall, recognition, and cued-
recall — and centered on a primary exemplar of each category.
We selectively discuss further schemes and extensions offering
interesting additional characteristics and improvements, or
where signiﬁcant usability studies or security analysis has
allowed a better understanding. We systematically review
usability requirements and features for comparative analysis,
and highlight specialized analysis techniques. We consider
threat models, catalogue known attack strategies, and discuss
the suitability of different schemes for various environments.
Besides providing speciﬁc authentication alternatives, we ﬁnd
research into graphical passwords allows for better understand-
ing of knowledge-based authentication in general by looking
at issues such as user choice in password selection, memory
interference, and the role of cueing in password memorability.
Looking to the future, we consider methodological issues for
evaluation of proposals, discuss challenges related to empirical
evaluation, and extract lessons that can be learned from the
research to date. We believe that if graphical passwords are
to advance as a serious authentication alternative, research
must be conducted and presented more in a manner allowing
systematic examination and comparison of each scheme’s
main characteristics, showing how each meets the usability
and security requirements of speciﬁc target environments.

II. MEMORABILITY
For over a century, psychology studies have recognized the
human brain’s apparently superior memory for recognizing
and recalling visual
information as opposed to verbal or
textual information [14]–[17]. The most widely accepted the-
ory explaining this difference is the dual-coding theory [18],
suggesting that verbal and non-verbal memory (respectively,
word-based and image-based) are processed and represented
differently in the mind. Images are mentally represented in a
way that retains the perceptual features being observed and are
assigned perceived meaning based on what is being directly
observed. Text is represented symbolically, where symbols
are given a meaning cognitively associated with the text, as
opposed to a perceived meaning based on the form of the
text. For example, ‘X’ may represent the roman numeral 10
or the multiplication symbol; the exact meaning is associated
in relation to some deeper concept. This additional processing
required for verbal memory renders this a more difﬁcult
cognitive task.
Tasks involving visual memory can also vary in difﬁculty
due to the particular characteristics of the retrieval process.
Graphical passwords can be broadly categorized according to
the memory task involved in remembering and entering the
password: recall, recognition, and cued-recall [19]. We base
our classiﬁcation on these categories.
Recall requires that a person remember information without
cueing. With recognition, a person is provided with the infor-
mation and has to decide whether this matches the information
previously memorized. Several theories exist to explain the
difference between recognition and recall memory, based on
whether these are two unique processes or whether they are
similar and differ only in their retrieval difﬁculty [20]. It
is generally accepted, however, that recognition is an easier
memory task than recall [21], [22]. In cued-recall, an external
cue is provided to help remember information. Tulving and
Pearlstone [23] explain that items in human memory may
be available but not accessible for retrieval. Their results
show that previously inaccessible information in a pure recall
situation can be retrieved with the aid of a retrieval cue.
III. SECURITY
An authentication system must provide adequate security for
its intended environment, otherwise it fails to meet its primary
goal. A proposed system should at minimum be evaluated
against common attacks to determine if it satisﬁes security
requirements. A brief introduction is provided here and a more
detailed discussion of security follows in Section VIII.
We classify the types of attacks on knowledge-based au-
thentication into two general categories: guessing and capture
attacks. In successful guessing attacks, attackers are able
to either exhaustively search through the entire theoretical
password space, or predict higher probability passwords (i.e.,
create a smaller dictionary of likely passwords) so as to obtain
an acceptable success rate within a manageable number of
guesses. Guessing attacks may be conducted online through
the intended login interface or ofﬂine if some veriﬁable
text [24] (e.g., hashes) can be used to assess the correctness
of guesses. Authentication systems with small
theoretical
password spaces or with identiﬁable patterns in user choice
of passwords are especially vulnerable to guessing attacks.
Password capture attacks involve directly obtaining the
password, or part thereof, by capturing login credentials when
entered by the user, or by tricking the user into divulging
their password. Shoulder-surﬁng, phishing, and some kinds
of malware are three common forms of capture attacks. In
shoulder-surﬁng, credentials are captured by direct observation
of the login process or through some external recording
device such as a video camera. Phishing is a type of social
engineering attack where users are tricked into entering their
credentials at a fraudulent website that records users’ input.
Malware attacks use unauthorized software installed on client
computers or servers to capture keyboard, mouse, or screen
output, which is then parsed to ﬁnd login credentials.
As will be seen in the following sections, early graphical
password systems tended to focus on one particular strength,
for example being resistent to shoulder-surﬁng, but testing and
analysis showed that they were vulnerable to one or more other
types of attacks. Except in very speciﬁc environments, these
would not provide adequate security.
Often playing an important role related to security is the
particular process of encoding or discretization used — trans-
forming the user input into discrete units that can be identiﬁed
by the system and used for comparison during password re-
entry. As will be seen, some schemes require that the system
retains knowledge of the exact secret (or portion thereof),
either to display the correct set of images to the user or to
verify password entries. In other cases, encoded or discretized
passwords may be hashed, using a one-way cryptographic
hash, for storage to provide additional security in case the
password ﬁle is compromised.
IV. RECALL-BASED SYSTEMS
Recall-based graphical password systems are occasionally
referred to as drawmetric systems [25] because users recall and
reproduce a secret drawing. In these systems, users typically
draw their password either on a blank canvas or on a grid
(which may arguably act as a mild memory cue). Recall is a
difﬁcult memory task [26] because retrieval is done without
memory prompts or cues. Users sometimes devise ways of
using the interface as a cue even though it is not intended as
such, transforming the task into one of cued-recall, albeit one
where the same cue is available to all users and to attackers.
Text passwords can also be categorized as using recall
memory. With text passwords, there is evidence that users
often include the name of the system as part of their pass-
words [27], [28]. Although there is currently no evidence of
this happening with graphical passwords, it remains a plausible
coping strategy if users can devise a way of relating a recall-
based graphical password to a corresponding account name.
A number of security vulnerabilities are common to most
recall-based systems, as these systems share similar features.
(We brieﬂy discuss some attacks related to recall-based sys-
tems here; see Section VIII for background and additonal
details.) These systems are generally susceptible to shoulder-
surﬁng to the extent that in many cases, the entire drawing
TR-09-09: GRAPHICAL PASSWORDS

is visible on the screen as it is being entered, and thus an
attacker need accurately observe or record only one login for
the entire password to be revealed.
Social engineering attacks remain a concern in cases where
users can describe their password by, for example, verbalizing
a path through grid squares, or by showing a sketch of the
password. Phishing attacks are easily mounted. A phishing
website can copy the login page from a legitimate site,
including the area for drawing the graphical password (see
Figure 1). Once users enter their username and password, this
information can be used by attackers at the legitimate site.
The recall-based schemes discussed below are also vulnera-
ble to malware attacks based on screen scrapers, and to mouse-
loggers if an attacker can identify the position of the password
entry grid on the screen through other means.
In typical recall-based systems, users choose their own
passwords. It is therefore possible that a personalized attack
may be more successful than a general attack — someone
familiar with the user may have a higher probability of
guessing the user’s password. For example, some users might
choose to draw the initials of their name. While successful
personalized attacks have yet to be reported in the literature
for recall-based graphical systems, such experimental results
have been reported for password recovery mechanisms such
as personal veriﬁcation questions [29].
The following subsections provide an overview of recall-
based graphical password schemes in the literature to date,
centered on Draw-A-Secret [11]. Others are variations of it.
A. Canonical Example: Draw-A-Secret
Draw-A-Secret (DAS) [11] was the ﬁrst recall-based graph-
ical password system proposed. Users draw their password on
a 2D grid using a stylus or mouse (see Figure 1). A drawing
can consist of one continuous pen stroke or preferably, several
strokes separated by “pen-ups” that restart the next stroke in
a different cell. To log in, users repeat the same path through
the grid cells. The system encodes the user-drawn password
as the sequence of coordinates of the grid cells passed through
in the drawing, yielding an encoded DAS password. Its length
is the number of coordinate pairs summing across all strokes.
There is little information on either the usability or the
practical security of the original DAS system, as to date it
has only been user tested through paper prototypes (but see
also the related Pass-Go system, below). Nali and Thorpe [30]
asked 16 participants to draw 6 “doodles” and 6 “logos” on
6 × 6 grids. These drawings were visually inspected for sym-
metry and number of pen strokes. They found that participants
tended to draw symmetric images with few pen strokes (1-3),
and to place their drawing approximately in the center of the
grid. Limitations of this preliminary study included: users were
not told that their drawings were “passwords”, users did not
have to later reproduce their drawings, and data was collected
on paper (rather than users drawing using a computer). No
usability data (login times, success rates, etc.) was collected.
The size of the theoretical password space, that is, the
number of all possible passwords regardless of how small their
probabilities in actual practice, is related to the coarseness of
