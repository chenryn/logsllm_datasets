This implies the patient side in the OO-KP-ABKS [38] and
the SODSF [41] schemes can fast generate the ciphertext
during the online encryption phase, but they still required to
consume expensive computational resources for encryption.
As for the storage space occupied of trapdoor, as illustrated
in Fig. 5-(f), our LABSE and OO-KP-ABKS [38] is higher
than that in SFGEKS [40] and SODEF [41], which is similar
to the Fig. 5-(a), since the trapdoor is computed on the basis
of the secret key. However, what is surprising is that our
LABSE can generate a valid trapdoor at the cost of the quite
cheap computation (is approximate to 15 ms) as shown in
Fig. 5-(g). And in Fig. 5-(h), it shows the computational time
cost for the simulated CSP to search the desired ciphertext
of the above four schemes. We can ﬁnd that they raises with
the number of attributes, and our LABSE outperforms OO-
KP-ABKS [38] and SODSF [41], but is inferior to SFGEKS
[40]. We need not to pay much attentions to the time cost
of search, since it is designed to executed by a powerful
trusted server. Finally, for the decryption time consumption,
as shown in Fig. 5-(i), the doctor side mobile terminal device
in our LABSE scheme can recover the data plaintext at the
cost of only 10.34 ms on average, which is time-efﬁcient than
the remainder schemes.
In addition to measure the storage space occupied and
computational time cost of the resource-constrained devices
in patient side and the doctor side, considering these devices
are usually battery-powered, we also need to evaluate the
energy consumption in the patient side and the doctor
side, respectively. Notice that in the above experiment, the
Raspberry Pi model 3B+ microcomputer is powered by a
5V 2A DC power supply. Motivated by Xiong et al.’s work
[47], we can estimate the energy consumption of algorithm
execution with the formula W = U It, where U, I, t respec-
tively denote the operating voltage, the operating current
and the time consumption. Furthermore, according to the
measured data in Zhang et al.’s work [44], it costs 0.00066
mJ and 0.00031 mJ for an IEEE 802.11 spectrum 24 WLAN
card to transmit and receive 1 bit data respectively, then
we can estimate the communication energy consumption in
the experiment based on the measured data. Fig. 6 reﬂects
the comparison on the energy consumption of the patient
side and the doctor side in our experiment platform. We
can observe from Fig. 6-(a) that the simulated patient side
energy consumption of these schemes are all remain stable
with the growth of the attribute number. And the patient
side only consumes 0.973 J on average, which is much more
energy-efﬁcient than OO-KP-ABKS [38] and SODSF [41],
and it also consumes nearly 70% less energy than SFGEKS
[40]. In the doctor side, as illustrated in Fig. 6-(b), our LABSE
scheme also shows its energy-saving superiority, the doctor
side only need to consume 0.605 J even if the number of
attributes reaches 50.
9 CONCLUSION
This paper presents the LABSE scheme as well as a
concrete deployment model of it in the IoT-oriented cloud-
assisted healthcare system. The proposed scheme supports
lightweight and ﬁne-grained access control and keyword
search, and can signiﬁcantly alleviates the computational

side and the doctor side
the personal computer consumes 1252.63 ms to compute
the secret key when the number of attribute reaches 50),
while the resource-constrained device is free from the heavy
secret key generation overheads. And it is undeniable that
SFGEKS [40] is far more superior to other schemes in
terms of secret key storage size and computational time
consumption. However, Fig. 5-(c), Fig. 5-(d) and Fig. 5-
(e) manifest the superiority of our LABSE scheme in com-
parison of other schemes in terms of ciphertext storage
cost and computational time consumption. We can observe
from them that the ciphertext storage cost, the total time
consumption and online computation time consumption of
ciphertext remain stable with the raising of attribute number
(they reach 512 bytes, 114.06 ms on average and 78.14 ms
on average, respectively). More speciﬁcally, the storage cost
and total computational time cost of ciphertext in LABSE are
superior to SFGEKS [40], and far outperforms OO-KP-ABKS
[38] and SODSF [41]. When we turn our sight to the online
encryption phase, we ﬁnd that the time cost of ciphertext
generation in LABSE is cheaper than SFGEKS [40] and OO-
KP-ABKS [38], but are more expensive than SODSF [41].

tient and the data user side. We then prove the semantic
security and analyze the security properties of LABSE. Per-

the real scenario, and is superior to related schemes in terms
of computational time and energy consumption.
