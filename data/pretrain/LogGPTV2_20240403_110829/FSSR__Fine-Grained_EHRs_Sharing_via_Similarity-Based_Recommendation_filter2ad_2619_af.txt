**Fig. 5: Comparisons of experimental results**

- **(a)** Storage cost of the secret key
- **(b)** Computational time cost of key generation
- **(c)** Storage cost of the ciphertext
- **(d)** Total computational time cost of encryption
- **(e)** Computational time cost of online encryption

**Observations:**
- The OO-KP-ABKS [38] and SODSF [41] schemes allow fast ciphertext generation during the online encryption phase but still require significant computational resources.
- The storage space occupied by the trapdoor in LABSE and OO-KP-ABKS [38] is higher than in SFGEKS [40] and SODEF [41], similar to the secret key storage.
- LABSE can generate a valid trapdoor with minimal computational cost (approximately 15 ms).
- The computational time for searching desired ciphertexts increases with the number of attributes, with LABSE outperforming OO-KP-ABKS [38] and SODSF [41] but being inferior to SFGEKS [40].
- The decryption time for LABSE is efficient, with an average of 10.34 ms.

### Energy Consumption

**Fig. 6: Comparisons of energy consumption in the patient and doctor sides**

- **Patient Side**: Energy consumption remains stable with the growth of the attribute number, consuming 0.973 J on average, which is more energy-efficient than OO-KP-ABKS [38] and SODSF [41], and 70% less than SFGEKS [40].
- **Doctor Side**: LABSE shows energy-saving superiority, consuming 0.605 J even with 50 attributes.

### Conclusion

This paper presents the LABSE scheme, supporting lightweight and fine-grained access control and keyword search in IoT-oriented cloud-assisted healthcare systems. The scheme significantly reduces computational overheads for resource-constrained devices, both for patients and data users. We prove the semantic security and analyze the security properties of LABSE, demonstrating its practicality and superiority in terms of computational time and energy consumption.
