### Steps to Reproduce and Minimal Demo of the Problem

**Demo Link:**
- [Plunker Demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/h02LVM8sPwKJ6ljDVShz?p=preview)

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Open the provided Plunker demo.
2. Observe the behavior immediately upon loading the demo.

### Current Behavior
When using a method in conjunction with `[ngClass]`, the debugging output shows that the classes are initially applied correctly. However, these classes are subsequently removed before they can be visually observed by the user.

### Expected/Desired Behavior
The expected behavior is that returning an object from a method to `ngClass` should function identically to directly passing the object from the template. The classes should remain applied and be visible to the user.
