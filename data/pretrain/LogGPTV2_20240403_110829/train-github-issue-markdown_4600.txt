_What steps should we try in your demo to see the problem?_
Should see right away
**Current behavior**  
when using a method along with [ngClass], debugging shows that the classes get
applied correctly, but are then un-applied before the user can see them.
**Expected/desired behavior**  
Returning an object to ngClass via a method should be the same as passing the
object in directly from the template
