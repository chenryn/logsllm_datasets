User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Claws Mail SMTP issue; cannot send I am abandoning Thunderbird after it has slowly become a terrible, terrible piece of software for me. I have gotten everything set up with Claws, except sending. There are no official forums for this program, so I've been left to explore other options... here.

Below is the log message I get when trying to send a message in Claws mail. I cannot see anything wrong off the top of my head, except that I have no idea what a NOOP is. I have replaced the server information for the sake of privacy.

Assistant: This is only a response to one part of your question - as has been said in comments, the log you've shown is only for IMAP, and  you need to look for the SMTP logs in order for anybody to help you with sending.

The question that I can answer, however, is what the NOOP command does. It literally does nothing; it is sort for "no operation", and its only purpose is to keep the IMAP connection open. If you don't send any data through a TCP connection, it will be shut down by either the server or the client computer after a specific time, since one of them will consider it non-active. Sending NOOP and getting a reply to it will keep that from happening.
