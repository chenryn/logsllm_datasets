these 80.1% are malware, trailed by FS with 9.6%.
3.1.3 Across ASes. Figure 3c shows the distribution of mal-activities
per AS. Majority (82.4%) of the ASes are involved in more than one
mal-activity, with 59.2% of all labelled ASes contributing to at least
5 mal-activities. Among the different classes of mal-activities, Mal-
ware is seen in the highest proportion of ASes, specifically in 88.3%
of all reported ASes. In contrast, spammers are distributed over the
smallest proportion of ASes, only 4.33%.
Insights. We note that AS16509 (managed by AMAZON-02 and
located in US) is the most aggressive with 25.8M of all mal-activities
(52.0% of all labeled mal-activities in our dataset). We also observe
that it has contributed to all classes of mal-activities, predominantly
malware (24.5M) and phishing (463K). This indicates that cloud
service providers are often preferred by cybercriminals to inflict
harm on online services at scale.
3.2 Normalized Geo-Density and Diversity
To minimize the bias of massive Internet services infrastructures in
countries such as the US, we investigate the normalized distribution
of mal-activities. To this end, we use the CIPB [4] and AS-Rank [3]
datasets to garner the total number of allocated IP addresses per
country and per AS, respectively, and measure the ratio of the
number of malicious IP addresses to the total allocated IP addresses
of a given country or AS.
3.2.1 Across Countries. Figure 4a depicts the CDFs of the number
of mal-activities per country. Overall, the ratio of malicious IP
addresses to the total number of addresses is low, however, the
long-tail of the distributions (the top right) reveal a few countries
with relatively high proportion of IP addresses participating in mal-
activities. In Table 3(a), we list the top 5 countries that correspond to
the tail of the distributions in Figure 4a. The table shows that British
Virgin Islands (VG) has the highest proportion of IP addresses
followed by Anguilla, Lithuania, Belize, and Luxembourg.
Insights. The biggest proponent of mal-activities within the British
Virgin Islands is AS40034 (with 205K reports), under the control
of Confluence-Networks which is a large hosting service provider.
The next biggest contributing AS is AS44571, netVillage, a social
networking platform provider, which has 2.4K reports. Anguilla’s
high proportion of mal-activities are predominantly the result of
HostiServer, controlling AS32338, another content AS. This shows
that only a few ASes might drive up the normalized distribution of
mal-activities in countries with smaller Internet infrastructures.
3.2.2 Across Ases. Similarly, we plot the normalized distribution of
malicious IP addresses per AS in Figure 4b, which shows a similar
trend to country level analysis, despite all distributions appearing
to stretch to both lower and higher percentages. This suggests that
there are ASes that do not host or rarely host malicious IP addresses,
in addition to ASes in which a large ratio of their allocated IP space
has been observed to partake in mal-activities. Table 3(b) lists the
top 5 ASes with the highest ratio. We observe that AS31624, located
in the Netherlands (NL) and belonging to VFMNL-AS, has 57.6% of
its IPs participating in 12.3K reports of Mal-Activities corresponding
to all six categories of mal-activity. AS44901 (BELCLOUD, Bulgaria)
is the second and AS54761 (SAMBREEL-SVCS, United States) is the

third in the list with 44.5% and 33.7% respectively, participating in
mal-Activities.
Insights. AS31624 is a now defunct Trading and Service De-
posit Company. BELCLOUD’s AS44901 is a data center, which had
previously routed malicious requests, as detected by BGP Route
Views [23]. Sambreel, is a software services company which de-
veloped adware plugins that were later abused by advertisers [24],
contributing to a larger space of maliciously marked IP addresses.
A shared trait between these ASes is that they have comparatively
smaller IP space, with none of the three exceeding 5,000 allocated
IP addresses. The reader may argue that content ASes, in particular,
hosting services, are expected to have a large proportion of their
IP space constantly abused. However, we observe that in all the
registered content ASes, only 5% have more than 1% of their IP
Space marked as malicious. Note further that viewing the propor-
tions of IP space marked as malicious does not give the complete
picture, as the biggest offenders in terms of volume of mal-activities
is AS20940 (Akamai International B.V.), and AS14618 (Amazon.com,
Inc.), with a proportion of malicious IP space of only 0.49% and
1.36% respectively.

3.3 Geographical Entropy of Mal-Activity
In this section, we aim to find if (classes) of mal-activities are evenly
spread across hosts (IP addresses, ASes and countries) or are they
concentrated around a particular hosting infrastructure. We do this
by assessing the “geographical entropy” of mal-activities with a
diversity (or homogeneity) metric named affinity based on Shannon
entropy.
Affinity. We define affinity as the normalized entropy per malicious
h q(h, a) log2 q(h, a))/log2 l, where l is the
activity a as A(a) = (−
number of hosts hosting an activity a, and;
q(h, a) =
.
# of reports from host h with activity a
Total # of reports for activity a
Here A(a) = 1 means that reports of the mal-activity a are uniformly
distributed among all hosts and conversely, and A(a) = 0 implies
that all reports are concentrated on a single host.
Session 3A: Web Attack MeasurementsAsiaCCS ’19, July 9–12, 2019, Auckland, New Zealand199Insights. We observe that at the IP host level, mal-activities are
relatively evenly distributed with Spammers having the highest
affinity (0.820), closely followed by PUP (0.815) and Malware having
the least (0.691). However, if we look at the AS host level, we see that
some classes of mal-activities are concentrated around a few ASes.
Malware has the lowest affinity (0.260), followed by 0.342 (PUPs),
0.458 (Phishing), 0.556 (FS), 0.564 (exploits), and 0.689 (spammers).
Digging further, we observe that 80.8% of all mal-activities are
covered by 10 ASes. Likewise, 83.8% of Malware is carried out by 10
ASes, and just 10 ASes contribute 84.2% of PUPs. The high affinity
of PUPs over IP addresses and low affinity over ASes confirms the
observation in [58] that PUPs are more stable or hosted over bullet-
proof infrastructure.3 Thus the different IP addresses contributing
to the PUPs, belong to only a few ASes. One of the reasons for the
stability of PUPs is that they are generally in a grey area making
them semi-legitimate and hence making it difficult to detect them
or take them down.
At the country level, PUPs exhibit the lowest affinity (0.085) and
spammers the highest (0.551). We observe that US alone contributes
94.2% of the PUP activity in contrast to its contributions of 35.4%
to the spamming. The change in affinity of PUPs from IP addresses
to ASes and now to the country level can be explained by the fact
that most PUPs (and malware) often rely on pay-per-install (PPI)
services4 that in turn use cloud providers, often located in the
US, to distribute unwanted programs. This has previously been
noted for instance for Amazon [41, 46], Integral Ad Science, and
DoubleClick [50]. We argue that mal-activity detection techniques
that only vet malicious infrastructures would fail to detect and
prevent the distribution of such mal-activities.
4 TEMPORAL ANALYSIS
The next contribution of this paper is the temporal analysis of
mal-activity reporting behavior. We start by observing the volume
of each class of reported mal-activity in our dataset over time.
Obviously the seed dataset Blacklist-07-17 corresponds to blacklists
with different time ranges, and therefore might be biased towards
specific periods of time where a particular mal-activity class would
be more aggressively reported than others (cf. § 2.6). However our
use of VirusTotal across the whole 2007-2017 period is intended to
overcome this limitation as we believe the extensive number of AV
products and their reports would be providing a comprehensive
scan of the whole reporting period.
Note that we avoid drawing conclusions out of IPs reported
globally as these are subject to dynamic IP allocation issues (e.g.
via DHCP).
4.1 Evolution of Reporting of Mal-Activities
We analyze the daily volume of different classes of reported mal-
activities in our dataset over time in Figure 5a (note log scale of
y-axis). Perhaps not surprisingly, we observe that reported mal-
activities have been steadily increasing in volume over the last
decade, with an interesting spike around 2008-2009 driven by the
inception of high-profile FS and exploit kits. One of the earliest
kits was MPack [52], a very popular “user-friendly” exploit kit
3i.e., hosts that guarantee service even after being detected malicious.
4PPI services are also used for benign software.

(b) Proportion
introduced in 2006. Typically, MPack included a collection of PHP
scripts aiming at exploiting browsers’ security holes and commonly
used programs (e.g., QuickTime).
Phishing has seen two distinct periods of reporting. First, during
2009 and then in 2013 with an increase in the total volume of reports
by two orders of magnitude. This is consistent with a report from
Kaspersky Lab in 2013 [9] which points to the growing popularity
of digital payment systems attracting unwanted attention from
cybercriminals translated into a dramatic increase in the number
of finance-related attacks. We present the relative volume of the
reported mal-activity classes over time in Figure 5b. We see that
malware continues to dominate the proportion of mal-activities.
However, phishing has recently undergone an increase in volume:
29% of all mal-activities in the year 2017. In comparison, malware
stands at 59% of all mal-activities for the same year.
Lessons Learned. Malware is consistently the dominant class over
the years. However, interestingly, starting from around 2016-2017,
phishing is emerging as one of the major classes of mal-activities,
currently consisting of half the volume of Malware. Notwithstand-
ing that data sources may not have immediately reported on novel
classes of mal-activities (lower volume of mal-activities, other than
malware, in earlier years), the relative volume serves as a reasonable
proxy of the evolution of mal-activities reporting behavior.

c th period of activity of host i.
4.2 The Churn in Mal-Activity Reporting
Previous research [57] showed that spammers often quarantine
bots for a period of time, waiting for them to be “whitelisted” again.
Motivated by this, we study the periods of presence of IP addresses,
ASes and Countries (all denoted as hosts for simplicity) in the public
reports.
The Host Churn Model. Consider a malicious ecosystem with n
participating hosts, where each host h is either alive (i.e., present
in the system) or dead (i.e., logged off/clean/not reported) at any
given time t. An active host can be reported one or multiple times
as being malicious (denoted m). This behavior can be modeled by
an alternating renewal process Zi(t) for each host h, similar to the
peers churn model in peer-to-peer networks (e.g. Yao et al., [62]):
Zi(t) = 1 if host i has received at least one report at time t, and
Zi(t) = 0 otherwise, where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and t is in weeks. Our traces
are created by binning the reports into weeks per reported host
(recall that host refers to an IP, AS or CC).
c =1) and off-time (i.e., {Di,c}∞
The model is illustrated in Figure 6 where c stands for the cycle
number, and durations of host i’s ON (life) and OFF (death) periods
are given by variables Li,c > 0 and Di,c > 0, respectively. Unlike
the model in [62], we empirically evaluate (through our data) all
lifetime (i.e., {Li,c}∞
c =1) durations by
averaging over all cycles in our dataset. We denote the average
lifetime as Li and the average deathtime as Di.
A high average lifetime would reflect a report of persistent threats
(or infection) generally referred to as bulletproof entities, since
their involvement in mal-activities is not interrupted for extended
durations (even after being reported). A low average deathtime
indicates resiliency of the reported host as the mal-activity quickly
recovers from a potential shutdown. The reciprocal of mean cycle
duration is representative of the rate of arrival of a particular host. It
indicates the frequency with which a host participates in, or leaves,
a class of mal-activity and is defined as: λi =
. Consider a
scenario where a malicious host is frequently joining and leaving a
group of reported botnets (i.e., in bursts), then both average lifetime
and average deathtime would be small, and hence λi would be
relatively large.
Figure 7 displays the CDFs of mean lifetime, mean deathtime
and reciprocal of mean duration per IP address, ASN and country in
the Blacklists. Figure 7a shows that 86.4% of the IPs are short-lived
offenders with an average duration of just a week. As mentioned
earlier, we refrain from drawing conclusions on the time-based
behavior observed at an IP level due to the very likely dynamic IP
allocation over time. At an AS-level we found that 56.5% of the ASes
are short-lived with an average of one week duration of presence
in the blacklists. This number is drastically reduced to 17.4% for
countries, many of which are small African nations, or island states.

The long tails observed in the CDF of mean lifetime in Figure 7a
indicate that there are only a few hosts with an extended lifetime.
