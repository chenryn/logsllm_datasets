### Problem description
The _Nearby_ entry uses inline SVG and is left-aligned in contrast to the both
other icons, which are centered.

### Steps to reproduce
Have a look at http://www.material-ui.com/#/components/bottom-navigation
### Versions
  * Material-UI: v0.5.14
  * React: v15.3.0 (?)
  * Browser: Chrome Canary v54
### Possible fix
If I add `margin: auto;` to the SVG element in the rendered code (Inspect),
the icon is centered. I'm not sure how to apply this fix to the source code
however, as I'm unfamiliar with React / MUI.
