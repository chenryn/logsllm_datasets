Hello everyone,
Would it be useful to have something like _numpy.stats_ on the grounds of
_scipy.stats.describe_ ?  
Though a simple implementation, I believe it would be very handy for Numpy
users. More information on _scipy.stats.describe_ here :
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.describe.html
.
Thanks
