Hello everyone,

I would like to propose the addition of a `numpy.stats` module, inspired by the functionality provided in `scipy.stats.describe`. While this would be a relatively simple implementation, I believe it would offer significant convenience for Numpy users.

For more information on `scipy.stats.describe`, please refer to the official documentation: [scipy.stats.describe](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.describe.html).

Thank you for considering this suggestion.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
