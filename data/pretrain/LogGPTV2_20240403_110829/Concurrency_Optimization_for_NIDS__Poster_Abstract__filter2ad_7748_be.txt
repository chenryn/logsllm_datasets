CO-AUTHORS: Veronica Mardegan, Antonella Gucciardi, Matteo Stocchero, Paola Pirillo, Gabriele Poloniato, Mauro Naturale, Eugenio Baraldi.
Neonatal sepsis is a complex infection-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome and it is a main cause of mortality and neurologic 
sequelae in newborns An early and accurate detection of sepsis is mandatory in neonates, since the clinical course of the infectious process can 
be fulminant, leading to septic shock and death within hours after the first clinical symptoms To date, there is still no reliable biochemical marker 
of neonatal sepsis The aim was to compare the metabolic profile of urine collected within 24 hours of birth between preterm neonates affected 
by early onset sepsis (EOS) and healthy preterm infants, searching for a specific metabolic profile enabling the identification of preterm newborns 
prone to develop EOS Infants who developed a septic episode within 72 hours of birth were enrolled as cases (9 cases and 10 controls who did not 
developed a septic episode) The urine samples underwent untargeted metabolomic analysis using LC-MS The data were analyzed by multivariate 
and univariate data analysis tools For each data set, a multivariate biomarker showing area under the ROC curve calculated by cross-validation 
greater than 080 was built The annotated variables were submitted to over-representation pathway analysis that highlighted the perturbation of 
6 metabolic pathways Neonates with EOS showed a specific metabolic profile compared to those of newborns not affected by sepsis at the onset 
of infection Results of this research support the effectiveness of metabolomics in exploring biochemical pathways of neonatal sepsis, potentially 
providing novel putative biomarkers for early diagnosis

Background: Obesity amongst women of reproductive age is increasingly common in developed nations and has been shown to adversely affect 
childhood cardio-metabolic, respiratory and cognitive-related health outcomes in offspring Metabolomic signatures of obesity are readily captured 
in biofluids samples and could potentially provide a molecular barometer for monitoring excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) and postpartum 
weight loss (WL) in overweight/obese pregnant women Methods: Urine and blood plasma samples were collected from 114 overweight or obese 
ethnically diverse pregnant women from Chicago (USA), as part of a randomised diet and lifestyle intervention trial (Maternal Offspring Metabolics 
Family Intervention Trial; wwwclinicaltrialsgov NCT01631747) Blood plasma lipids and urine samples at 15 weeks, 35 weeks of gestation, and at 1 
year postpartum were respectively analysed by LC-MS and NMR Results: Urinary 4-deoxyerythronic acid was found positively correlated to body 
mass index (BMI) and a broad spectrum of alterations in levels of blood plasma phosphatidylcholines, lysophospholipids, and sphingomyelins 
were associated with BMI, GWG, and WL Specifically, several plasmanyl-/plasmenyl-phospholipids were negatively associated with GWG, and 
lysophosphatidylcholines (including LPC 20:4) were positively associated with WL Multiple lipids with apparent 18:2 fatty-acid chains were 
significantly associated with GWG/ WL, suggesting linoleic acid, an essential nutrient, may play an important role in prenatal and postpartum weight 
management Conclusions: Maternal obesity-related parameters are associated with urine and plasma metabolomic profiles, which could be further 
exploited to evaluate the beneficial effect of diet and lifestyle intervention in pregnancy

A population-based resource for intergenerational metabolomics analyses in pregnant women and their children:  
the Generation R Study
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Ellis Voerman, Erasmus University Medical Center, Netherlands
CO-AUTHORS: Vincent W.V. Jaddoe, Romy Gaillard
Adverse exposures during fetal and early postnatal life may predispose children to cardio-metabolic disease in later life Early-life developmental 
adaptations of metabolic pathways may underlie these associations Metabolomics may serve a tool to disentangle these potential metabolic 
adaptations In a prospective population-based cohort study among pregnant women and their children from Rotterdam, the Netherlands, we 
used a targeted metabolomics approach to measure metabolite concentrations in maternal blood in early-pregnancy (n=825), cord blood at birth 
(n=932), and child’s blood at age 10 (n=508) We used liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to measure blood concentrations 
of amino acids, acyl-carnitines, polar lipids (including diacyl-phosphatidylcholines, acyl-alkyl-phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelines, acyl-
lysophosphatidylcholines and alkyl-lysophosphatidylcholines), and non-esterified fatty acids Preliminary exploratory analyses showed weak 
correlations between maternal concentrations of individual metabolites and concentrations of these metabolites in their children at birth (highest 
Spearman’s Rho: 036) and at the age of 10 years (highest Spearman’s Rho: 024), respectively Child’s metabolite concentrations at birth and at 10 
years of age were also weakly correlated (highest Spearman’s Rho: 036) Whether individual metabolite concentrations or metabolite patterns are 
related to maternal and child adverse exposures and health outcomes is subject of future analyses These data are an important population-based 
resource for metabolomics analyses in pregnant women and their children to address the early origins of health and disease

Asthma is one of the major chronic noncommunicable diseases affecting over 300 million people worldwide Exacerbations are the major burden 
in asthma management which are primarily triggered by rhinovirus exposures Temporal metabolite fluctuations in biofluids could be used to 
monitor and predict the disease exacerbations However, little is known on the individual variation of the metabolome, especially on the scale of 
weeks-to-months which is important to monitor health trajectories Here we present the temporal dynamics of urinary metabolites from BIOFLUC 
study (Netherlands trial register: NL5317) in healthy and asthmatic subjects before and after a rhinovirus challenge This a prospective longitudinal 
follow-up study in 12 healthy and 12 asthmatics over a period of 3 months with an experimental rhinovirus intervention after 2 months Multiple 
samples were collected from different sources 3 times a week amounting to more than 35 samples per subject Urine LC-MS metabolomic 
profiling of polar metabolites on zic-HILIC column using all ion fragmentation data acquisition was performed Data was processed with MS-DIAL 
software and metabolite identities confirmed by accurate mass, retention time and MS spectra Metabolite clustering by the CVs (coefficients of 
correlation) revealed several groups, with amino acid metabolites being less and food/drug metabolites being most variable Individual responses 
were observed after rhinovirus challenge with spikes of cytosine levels in many, but not all study participants Urinary metabolomics provides an 
accessible avenue to characterize individual baseline urine metabolites in healthy and asthmatic subjects thereby helping to identify compounds 
associated with disease presentation

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a rising global health problem, currently affecting >10% of the global population While smoking 
is the major risk factor for developing COPD, 20% of COPD patients have never smoked Prematurely born, particularly those who developed 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in the neonatal period, are a growing group of subjects at-risk of developing early-onset COPD BPD affects 10-
30% of premature children, corresponding to 1% of all newborns We present here the urine metabolomics of young adults from the LUNAPRE cohort 
(n=96; wwwclinicaltrialsgov/ct2/show/NCT02923648), consisting of 4 non-smoking groups, age 18-23: i) prematurely born (37 weeks, n=24), and iv) mild asthmatics born at term (>37 
weeks, n=23) We performed LC-HRMS-based urinary metabolomics in combination with targeted quantification of the urinary eicosanoid profiles 
Metabolomics identified 68 AMRT-confirmed metabolites, of which 39 were also MS/MS confirmed We observed a 24-fold increase in carnitine 
levels and a 06-fold decrease in acetyl-glucosamine levels in the pre-term BPD survivors compared to healthy pre-term group Multivariate 
analysis found that urinary eicosanoid profiles differed between the BPD survivor group relative to both the healthy pre-term group (p=0007) and 
the asthma group (p=002) The separation with both groups was primarily driven by downregulation of the thromboxane and prostaglandin D2 
pathways These preliminary analyses suggest that molecular signatures associated with BPD and birth-term persist into adulthood and may be 
useful for understanding this unique sub-group of COPD patients

High power vaping modifies cardiorespiratory parameters and urine metabolome: a randomized crossover trial in heavy 
ecigarette users
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Vanessa Tagliatti, University of Mons, Belgium
CO-AUTHORS: Martin Chaumont
The use of electronic cigarettes has increased since its marketing However, health effects remain largely unknown due to its newness In the 
present study, effect of propylene-glycol and glycerol, e-cigarette constituents that facilitate liquid vaporization and nicotine transport, is evaluated 
in short-term cessation of e-cigarette vaping in regular-users Subjects were enrolled in a randomized investigator-blinded crossover-three-period 
study for five days before the experimental session (nicotine e-cigarettes: nicotine-session; nicotine-free vaping: nicotine-free-session; complete 
cessation of e-cigarette vaping: stop-session) Metabolomic analysis, by proton nuclear magnetic resonance, was performed on urine samples 
and baseline clinical/biological cardiorespiratory parameters were assessed at the beginning of each experimental session In comparison to 
nicotine- and nicotine-free-session, stop-session was characterized by a specific urine metabolomic signature (increase in hippurate and decrease 
in hydroxyisovalerate) This modified baseline urine metabolome sustained by an increase of serum CC16 concentration suggesting an improvement 
in lung inflammatory profile

1H NMR metabolomics of serum and EBC for understanding the pathophysiology of COPD associated PH
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Priyanka Choudhury, School of Medical Science and Technology, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India
CO-AUTHORS: Nilanjana Ghosh, Mamata Joshi, Parthasarathi Bhattacharyya, Sushmita Roy Chowdhury, Koel Chaudhury
Group III pulmonary hypertension (PH), considered to be a delayed complication of hypoxic lung diseases has a major burden of chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) COPD associated PH (COPD-PH) often gets overshadowed by the symptoms of COPD and is associated 
with shorter survival and worse clinical outcomes Understanding of the etiopathogenic mechanisms responsible for PH development in COPD 
remains incomplete In this study, we hypothesize that 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) based metabolomics will provide an insight into the 
pathophysiology of COPD-PH and will also be able to differentiate it from COPD alone at a metabolic level Two biofluids serum and exhaled breath 
condensate (EBC) are explored in the present study Paired serum and EBC samples were collected from patients with pure COPD (n=47), COPD-
PH (n=31) and healthy controls (n=39) NMR spectra of the samples were acquired using 800 MHz BrukerAvance III spectrometer equipped with 
a cryoprobe and the data subjected to univariate and multivariate analysis On comparing COPD-PH with COPD and controls, distinct metabolic 
differentiation was observed between the groups The OPLS-DA models generated for COPD-PH vs COPD showed good R2 and Q2 values [(a) 
Serum: R2Y (0902) and Q2 (0755) (b) EBC: R2Y (0901) and Q2 (0715)] indicating the robustness of the model The identified metabolites were 
found to be majorly associated with glycolysis pathway, amino acid and lipid metabolism The distinct metabolic signatures suggest that the two 
study groups are distinguishable from each other and also give us a preliminary idea about the pathophysiology of the disease

Lipidomic Quantitation of Respiratory Disease: A Rapid and Comprehensive HILIC-Based Targeted Approach
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Giorgis Isaac, Waters Corporation, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Nyasha Munjoma, Lee A. Gethings, Robert S. Plumb
Respiratory linked conditions associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and infection are increasing The analyses 
of plasma samples from three biological states of varying phenotype (control, COPD and asthma patients) were conducted Sample extraction was 
performed using a simple protein precipitation with a pre-cooled isopropanol Lipid analysis was performed using a fast (<8min), comprehensive 
and high-throughput targeted method which is based on UPLC-HILIC lipid class separation followed by MRM quantitation of individual lipid species 
It is integrated workflow for accurate and robust measurement of a carefully selected more than 500 lipid species Data were processed using 
TargetLynx and Skyline The biological samples were randomised and two technical replicates per sample were acquired Statistical analysis of the 
data revealed clear separation between the various cohorts Unsupervised PCA resulted in the separation of healthy controls, COPD and asthma 
patients Application of the metadata also revealed significant differences between smoking status, with subsets readily observed within the COPD 
population Loadings plot analysis revealed that FFA, LPC, PC and SM lipid classes to be the main contributors to sample type clustering Additional 
ANOVA/t-test and hierarchical clustering showed all the lipid classes referenced to be up-regulated except for PC’s A decrease in the level of 
PC’s was observed as significant for subjects associated with smoking Overall, PCs are a potential marker for oxidative stress (immune activation) 
Pathway analysis revealed several components related to inflammation, oxidative and immunity processes were identified as significant and 
associated with signalling, metabolic and regulatory pathways

Integrating expression data into metabolome-wide GWAS suggests candidate genes modulating metabolite concentration
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Reyhan Sonmez Flitman, University of Lausanne, Switzerland
CO-AUTHORS: Rico Rueedi, Sven Bergmann
Metabolome-wide GWAS (mGWAS) search for associations between metabolites and common genetic variants within large collections of samples 
NMR spectral intensities reflect metabolite concentrations, which in targeted NMR are combined to quantify a limited set of metabolites In order 
to avoid the often imperfect identification and quantification of metabolites, we designed a different type of mGWAS called untargeted mGWAS, 
that directly tests metabolome features for association with genetic variants, not discarding any data that may have eluded identification The 
effect of a genetic variant on the concentration of a metabolite tends to translate, in an untargeted mGWAS, to associations with all or some of the 
features corresponding to the pure NMR spectrum of the metabolite The association profile can therefore allow for identification of the underlying 
metabolite using a method we call metabomatching (Rueedi et al, PLoS Genetics 2014) Here, we apply metabomatching to associations with gene 
expression rather than genotypic variation To this end we used RNAseq profiles of lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from 555 CoLaus subjects for 
which we had also urine NMR data Specifically, we investigated the genes whose expression levels showed strong association with metabolome 
features We found that ALMS1 gene expression is strongly associated to the concentration of N-Acetyl L-Aspartate (NAA) making ALMS1 the most 
likely candidate gene for modulating this metabolite In summary our study provides evidence that the integration of metabolomics with gene 
expression data can support mQTL analysis, helping to identify the most likely gene involved in the modulation of the metabolite concentration

The application of artificial neural networks and deep learning to metabolomics
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Kevin Mendez, Edith Cowan University, Australia
CO-AUTHORS: Stacey Reinke, Leighton Pritchard, David Broadhurst
Metabolomics data are highly complex, both in terms of the number of variables and the high degree of multicollinearity between variables As 
such, multivariate machine learning methods that project the data into a smaller linear “latent” space before classification are routinely used, with 
Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) being by far the most popular approach However, it is generally observed that biological 
processes are nonlinear As such, it is fair to hypothesise that linear projection techniques may not be optimal Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are 
a class of nonlinear models introduced into the metabolomics community over 20 years ago, which failed to gain momentum due to computational 
requirements for optimisation, and the difficulty of interpretation Here we present a comparison of the standard back-propagation ANN against 
PLS-DA and other popular machine learning algorithms (RBF-Support Vector Machines, Random Forrest, Logistic Regression) across 8 data sets of 
various complexity and instrumentation All data sets were open access, downloaded from public online repositories (Metabolights & Metabolomics 
Workbench) All models were implemented in the Python 3 scripting language, presented using Jupyter Notebooks, and freely available on GitHub 
and mybinderorg Results show that ANNs generally outperform the alternatives, particularly when the applied data sets are large The ability to 
interpret ANNs have greatly improved since their first introduction thanks to advances in computer technology that allows the rapid use of methods 
such as network pruning and bootstrap resampling sensitivity analysis

Retip: Increasing compound identification rate in metabolomics with a new Retention Time Prediction software in R
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Paolo Bonini, NGAlab, Spain
CO-AUTHORS: Tobias Kind, Hiroshi Tsugawa, Dinesh Kumar Barupal and Oliver Fiehn
Background: Untargeted metabolomics datasets in LC-MS/MS present a large number of unidentified peaks Usually, less than 10% of all 
deconvoluted metabolic peak clusters are identified Using retention times as orthogonal information is important in workflows for compound 
annotations because each orthogonal parameter increases the confidence level in compound identification Methods: Five different machine 
learning algorithms have been employed and integrated into the Retip method: Random Forest, Bayesian Regularized Neural Network, Keras, 
XGBoost and LightGBM Retention time prediction models have been developed for the two most common separation principles, reversed phase 
(RP) and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) We utilized two large publicly available dataset for training, the FiehnLab HILIC 
(n=981) and RIKEN PlaSMA (n=852) retention time databases Results: For both chromatographic databases the XGBoost method was the most 
accurate with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) on the testing set of 114 min for HILIC and 069 min for RP The Retip R package also significantly 
reduces the numbers of false positive compound’s by 265% and increases the correct identification rate by 21% Retip has been integrated into 
the mass spectrometry software tools MS-DIAL and MS-FINDER allowing for a complete compound annotation workflow Retip can be freely 
downloaded from the CRAN repository as an R package Conclusion: Predicted retention times increase the confidence for peak annotations in 
liquid chromatography and subsequently lead to improved biological interpretations in metabolomics

A single high-resolution mass spectrometry platform for targeted and untargeted lipid analysis revealed modification of  
lipids and discovery of novel lipids in Barley roots response to salt stress
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Thusitha Rupasinghe, Metabolomics Australia, Australia
CO-AUTHORS: Dingyi Yu, Berin A. Boughton, Siria H.A. Natera, Camilla B. Hill, Pablo Tarazona, Ivo Feussner, Ute Roessner
Untargeted and targeted lipidomics are two complementary approaches, which when combined can achieve in-depth and comprehensive lipidome 
characterisation and quantification The two approaches are usually performed on two different Mass Spectrometer platforms, triple-quadrupole 
(QqQ) type MS and high-resolution MS Here, we developed a robust lipidomics workflow merging both targeted and untargeted approaches on a 
single liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-time of flight system (LC-QqTOF) platform with scheduled parallel reaction monitoring (sPRM) 
sPRM assays integrate both untargeted profiling from MS1 scan and targeted quantification obtained from MS/MS data With scheduled algorithm 
and maximum 100 precursors multiplexed per duty cycle, sPRM assay can achieve a high-throughput targeted monitoring of more than 250 lipid 
species within a single injection This workflow enabled the identification and quantification of more than 700 lipid species from 25 lipid classes 
at the level of fatty acid/long chain base/sterol composition with three injections in a barley root extract To further demonstrate the workflow, 
a study on salt stress induced changes in the barley root lipidome was initiated as well as the discovery of novel lipid species in the group of 
oligohexosylceramides Results show that 232 targeted compounds and 888 unknown features were found to have significantly responded to salt 
stress This emerging targeted and untargeted lipidomics strategy combined in a single workflow provides novel insights into lipidomics and its 
applications in addressing biological questions

United Kingdom
CO-AUTHORS: Divya Kattupalli, Luis AJ Mur, Nigel W Hardy, Biswapriya B Misra, Chuan Lu
Direct infusion mass spectrometery (DIMS) is a widely used platform that is capable of producing a a global fingerprint of the metabolome, without 
prior requirement of a chromatographic step - making it ideal for wide scale high-throughput metabolomics analyses Metabolite identification is an 
arduous task that involves the querying of masses against a metabolite database in order to retrieve putative metabolite annotations Each existing 
metabolite database differs in a number of aspects including coverage, format, and accessibility - often limiting the user to a rudimentary web interface 
with no means of programmatically interfacing with the database Consequently, researchers often manually combine multiple search results for a 
single experiment in which the exploration of potentially hundreds of masses becomes an incredibly arduous task – and infeasible for many projects 
To facilitate unified access to metabolite information we have created the Direct Infusion MEtabolite database (DIMEdb), a comprehensive web-based 
programmatic metabolite database that contains over 80,000 metabolites sourced from a number of renowned metabolite databases of which can be 
utilised in the analysis and annotation of DIMS data DIMEdb is freely available at https://dimedbibersaberacuk

Metabolomics commonly uses analytical techniques such as NMR and LC-MS to quantify and identify metabolites related to biological 
alterations Metabolome coverage from non-targeted LC-MS studies relies heavily on the pre-analytical protocols used These protocols 
impact which metabolites are successfully measured and thus, the biological conclusions drawn Protocol standardization remains a challenge 
in the metabolomics community due to the variety of sample types analyzed and workflows used Previous studies have demonstrated that 
homogenization and extraction methods can produce large variations in the total number of metabolites detected, precision and yield To 
systematically determine the effects on metabolome coverage, artifact production, and experimental variation, different homogenization methods 
and extraction solvents (ie methanol, ethanol, 2:1 cholorform:methanol, and 9:1 ethylacetate:ethanol) have been examined using a mixed-stage
