**Abstract:**
Neonatal sepsis is a complex infection-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome and a leading cause of mortality and neurological sequelae in newborns. Early and accurate detection of sepsis is critical, as the clinical course can be fulminant, leading to septic shock and death within hours after the first symptoms. Currently, there is no reliable biochemical marker for neonatal sepsis. This study aimed to compare the metabolic profiles of urine collected within 24 hours of birth between preterm neonates with early-onset sepsis (EOS) and healthy preterm infants, to identify a specific metabolic profile that could predict EOS. Nine cases of neonates who developed sepsis within 72 hours of birth and ten controls who did not develop sepsis were enrolled. Urine samples underwent untargeted metabolomic analysis using LC-MS, and the data were analyzed using multivariate and univariate data analysis tools. A multivariate biomarker with an area under the ROC curve greater than 0.80 was identified. Pathway analysis highlighted perturbations in six metabolic pathways. The results support the effectiveness of metabolomics in exploring biochemical pathways of neonatal sepsis and provide potential novel biomarkers for early diagnosis.

**Abstract:**
Obesity among women of reproductive age is increasingly common in developed nations and adversely affects childhood cardio-metabolic, respiratory, and cognitive health outcomes in offspring. Metabolomic signatures of obesity in biofluids could provide a molecular barometer for monitoring excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) and postpartum weight loss (WL) in overweight/obese pregnant women. This study analyzed urine and blood plasma samples from 114 ethnically diverse, overweight or obese pregnant women in Chicago, USA, as part of a randomized diet and lifestyle intervention trial (Maternal Offspring Metabolics Family Intervention Trial; NCT01631747). Blood plasma lipids and urine samples at 15 weeks, 35 weeks of gestation, and one year postpartum were analyzed by LC-MS and NMR. Urinary 4-deoxyerythronic acid was positively correlated with body mass index (BMI), and alterations in levels of blood plasma phosphatidylcholines, lysophospholipids, and sphingomyelins were associated with BMI, GWG, and WL. Specific plasmanyl-/plasmenyl-phospholipids were negatively associated with GWG, and lysophosphatidylcholines (including LPC 20:4) were positively associated with WL. Multiple lipids with apparent 18:2 fatty-acid chains were significantly associated with GWG/WL, suggesting that linoleic acid, an essential nutrient, may play a crucial role in prenatal and postpartum weight management. Maternal obesity-related parameters are associated with urine and plasma metabolomic profiles, which could be further exploited to evaluate the beneficial effects of diet and lifestyle interventions during pregnancy.

**P-249: A Population-Based Resource for Intergenerational Metabolomics Analyses in Pregnant Women and Their Children: The Generation R Study**

**Presenting Author:**

**Co-Authors:**
- Vincent W.V. Jaddoe, Romy Gaillard

**Abstract:**
Adverse exposures during fetal and early postnatal life may predispose children to cardio-metabolic disease later in life. Early-life developmental adaptations of metabolic pathways may underlie these associations. Metabolomics can help disentangle these potential metabolic adaptations. In a prospective population-based cohort study among pregnant women and their children from Rotterdam, the Netherlands, we used a targeted metabolomics approach to measure metabolite concentrations in maternal blood in early pregnancy (n=825), cord blood at birth (n=932), and child's blood at age 10 (n=508). We used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to measure blood concentrations of amino acids, acyl-carnitines, polar lipids, and non-esterified fatty acids. Preliminary exploratory analyses showed weak correlations between maternal concentrations of individual metabolites and concentrations of these metabolites in their children at birth (highest Spearman’s Rho: 0.36) and at age 10 years (highest Spearman’s Rho: 0.24). Child's metabolite concentrations at birth and at 10 years of age were also weakly correlated (highest Spearman’s Rho: 0.36). Future analyses will explore whether individual metabolite concentrations or metabolite patterns are related to maternal and child adverse exposures and health outcomes. These data provide an important population-based resource for metabolomics analyses in pregnant women and their children to address the early origins of health and disease.

**Abstract:**
Asthma is a major chronic noncommunicable disease affecting over 300 million people worldwide. Exacerbations, primarily triggered by rhinovirus exposures, are a significant burden in asthma management. Temporal metabolite fluctuations in biofluids could be used to monitor and predict disease exacerbations. However, little is known about the individual variation of the metabolome, especially on the scale of weeks to months, which is important for monitoring health trajectories. This study presents the temporal dynamics of urinary metabolites from the BIOFLUC study (Netherlands trial register: NL5317) in healthy and asthmatic subjects before and after a rhinovirus challenge. This prospective longitudinal follow-up study included 12 healthy and 12 asthmatic subjects over three months, with an experimental rhinovirus intervention after two months. Multiple samples were collected three times a week, resulting in more than 35 samples per subject. Urine LC-MS metabolomic profiling of polar metabolites on a zic-HILIC column using all-ion fragmentation data acquisition was performed. Data were processed with MS-DIAL software, and metabolite identities were confirmed by accurate mass, retention time, and MS spectra. Metabolite clustering by the coefficients of variation (CVs) revealed several groups, with amino acid metabolites being less variable and food/drug metabolites being the most variable. Individual responses to the rhinovirus challenge were observed, with spikes in cytosine levels in many, but not all, participants. Urinary metabolomics provides an accessible method to characterize baseline urine metabolites in healthy and asthmatic subjects, helping to identify compounds associated with disease presentation.

**Abstract:**
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a rising global health problem, currently affecting more than 10% of the global population. While smoking is the major risk factor for developing COPD, 20% of COPD patients have never smoked. Prematurely born individuals, particularly those who developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in the neonatal period, are at increased risk of developing early-onset COPD. BPD affects 10-30% of premature children, corresponding to 1% of all newborns. This study presents the urine metabolomics of young adults from the LUNAPRE cohort (n=96; NCT02923648), consisting of four non-smoking groups, aged 18-23: i) prematurely born with BPD (n=24), ii) prematurely born without BPD (n=24), iii) term-born (≥37 weeks, n=25), and iv) mild asthmatics born at term (n=23). We performed LC-HRMS-based urinary metabolomics in combination with targeted quantification of urinary eicosanoid profiles. Metabolomics identified 68 AMRT-confirmed metabolites, of which 39 were also MS/MS confirmed. We observed a 2.4-fold increase in carnitine levels and a 0.6-fold decrease in acetyl-glucosamine levels in the pre-term BPD survivors compared to the healthy pre-term group. Multivariate analysis found that urinary eicosanoid profiles differed between the BPD survivor group and both the healthy pre-term group (p=0.007) and the asthma group (p=0.02). The separation from both groups was primarily driven by downregulation of the thromboxane and prostaglandin D2 pathways. These preliminary analyses suggest that molecular signatures associated with BPD and birth-term persist into adulthood and may be useful for understanding this unique sub-group of COPD patients.

**P-252: High Power Vaping Modifies Cardiorespiratory Parameters and Urine Metabolome: A Randomized Crossover Trial in Heavy E-cigarette Users**

**Presenting Author:**
- Vanessa Tagliatti, University of Mons, Belgium

**Co-Authors:**
- Martin Chaumont

**Abstract:**
The use of electronic cigarettes has increased since their introduction, but their health effects remain largely unknown due to their novelty. This study evaluated the effects of propylene-glycol and glycerol, constituents of e-cigarettes that facilitate liquid vaporization and nicotine transport, in short-term cessation of e-cigarette vaping in regular users. Subjects were enrolled in a randomized, investigator-blinded, crossover-three-period study for five days before the experimental session (nicotine e-cigarettes: nicotine-session; nicotine-free vaping: nicotine-free-session; complete cessation of e-cigarette vaping: stop-session). Metabolomic analysis by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was performed on urine samples, and baseline clinical/biological cardiorespiratory parameters were assessed at the beginning of each experimental session. Compared to the nicotine- and nicotine-free sessions, the stop-session was characterized by a specific urine metabolomic signature (increase in hippurate and decrease in hydroxyisovalerate). This modified baseline urine metabolome was sustained by an increase in serum CC16 concentration, suggesting an improvement in lung inflammatory profile.

**Abstract:**
Group III pulmonary hypertension (PH), a delayed complication of hypoxic lung diseases, is a major burden in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD-associated PH (COPD-PH) often gets overshadowed by COPD symptoms and is associated with shorter survival and worse clinical outcomes. The etiopathogenic mechanisms responsible for PH development in COPD remain incompletely understood. This study hypothesized that 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) based metabolomics would provide insights into the pathophysiology of COPD-PH and differentiate it from COPD alone at a metabolic level. Paired serum and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) samples were collected from patients with pure COPD (n=47), COPD-PH (n=31), and healthy controls (n=39). NMR spectra of the samples were acquired using an 800 MHz BrukerAvance III spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe, and the data were subjected to univariate and multivariate analysis. Distinct metabolic differentiation was observed between the groups. OPLS-DA models generated for COPD-PH vs. COPD showed good R2 and Q2 values [(a) Serum: R2Y (0.902) and Q2 (0.755); (b) EBC: R2Y (0.901) and Q2 (0.715)], indicating the robustness of the model. The identified metabolites were primarily associated with glycolysis, amino acid, and lipid metabolism. The distinct metabolic signatures suggest that the two study groups are distinguishable and provide preliminary insights into the pathophysiology of the disease.

**P-254: Lipidomic Quantitation of Respiratory Disease: A Rapid and Comprehensive HILIC-Based Targeted Approach**

**Presenting Author:**
- Giorgis Isaac, Waters Corporation, United States

**Co-Authors:**
- Nyasha Munjoma, Lee A. Gethings, Robert S. Plumb

**Abstract:**
Respiratory conditions associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and infection are increasing. This study analyzed plasma samples from three biological states of varying phenotypes (control, COPD, and asthma patients). Sample extraction was performed using a simple protein precipitation with pre-cooled isopropanol. Lipid analysis was conducted using a fast (<8 min), comprehensive, and high-throughput targeted method based on UPLC-HILIC lipid class separation followed by MRM quantitation of individual lipid species. The integrated workflow accurately and robustly measured over 500 carefully selected lipid species. Data were processed using TargetLynx and Skyline. Biological samples were randomized, and two technical replicates per sample were acquired. Statistical analysis revealed clear separation between the various cohorts. Unsupervised PCA resulted in the separation of healthy controls, COPD, and asthma patients. Application of metadata also revealed significant differences between smoking status, with subsets readily observed within the COPD population. Loadings plot analysis indicated that FFA, LPC, PC, and SM lipid classes were the main contributors to sample type clustering. Additional ANOVA/t-test and hierarchical clustering showed that all referenced lipid classes were up-regulated except for PCs, which decreased significantly in subjects associated with smoking. Overall, PCs are a potential marker for oxidative stress (immune activation). Pathway analysis revealed several components related to inflammation, oxidative, and immunity processes, identified as significant and associated with signaling, metabolic, and regulatory pathways.

**P-255: Integrating Expression Data into Metabolome-Wide GWAS Suggests Candidate Genes Modulating Metabolite Concentration**

**Presenting Author:**
- Reyhan Sonmez Flitman, University of Lausanne, Switzerland

**Co-Authors:**
- Rico Rueedi, Sven Bergmann

**Abstract:**
Metabolome-wide genome-wide association studies (mGWAS) search for associations between metabolites and common genetic variants within large collections of samples. NMR spectral intensities reflect metabolite concentrations, which in targeted NMR are combined to quantify a limited set of metabolites. To avoid imperfect identification and quantification of metabolites, we designed an untargeted mGWAS that directly tests metabolome features for association with genetic variants, not discarding any data that may have eluded identification. The effect of a genetic variant on the concentration of a metabolite tends to translate, in an untargeted mGWAS, to associations with all or some of the features corresponding to the pure NMR spectrum of the metabolite. The association profile can allow for the identification of the underlying metabolite using a method called metabomatching (Rueedi et al., PLoS Genetics 2014). Here, we applied metabomatching to associations with gene expression rather than genotypic variation. We used RNAseq profiles of lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from 555 CoLaus subjects for which we had urine NMR data. Specifically, we investigated the genes whose expression levels showed strong association with metabolome features. We found that ALMS1 gene expression is strongly associated with the concentration of N-Acetyl L-Aspartate (NAA), making ALMS1 the most likely candidate gene for modulating this metabolite. Our study provides evidence that integrating metabolomics with gene expression data can support mQTL analysis, helping to identify the most likely gene involved in the modulation of the metabolite concentration.

**P-256: The Application of Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning to Metabolomics**

**Presenting Author:**
- Kevin Mendez, Edith Cowan University, Australia

**Co-Authors:**
- Stacey Reinke, Leighton Pritchard, David Broadhurst

**Abstract:**
Metabolomics data are highly complex, both in terms of the number of variables and the high degree of multicollinearity between variables. Multivariate machine learning methods that project the data into a smaller linear "latent" space before classification are routinely used, with Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) being the most popular approach. However, biological processes are generally nonlinear, suggesting that linear projection techniques may not be optimal. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a class of nonlinear models introduced into the metabolomics community over 20 years ago but failed to gain momentum due to computational requirements for optimization and difficulty of interpretation. Here, we present a comparison of the standard back-propagation ANN against PLS-DA and other popular machine learning algorithms (RBF-Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) across eight datasets of various complexity and instrumentation. All datasets were open access, downloaded from public online repositories (Metabolights & Metabolomics Workbench). All models were implemented in Python 3, presented using Jupyter Notebooks, and freely available on GitHub and mybinder.org. Results show that ANNs generally outperform the alternatives, particularly when the datasets are large. The ability to interpret ANNs has greatly improved thanks to advances in computer technology, allowing the rapid use of methods such as network pruning and bootstrap resampling sensitivity analysis.

**P-257: Retip: Increasing Compound Identification Rate in Metabolomics with a New Retention Time Prediction Software in R**

**Presenting Author:**
- Paolo Bonini, NGAlab, Spain

**Co-Authors:**
- Tobias Kind, Hiroshi Tsugawa, Dinesh Kumar Barupal, Oliver Fiehn

**Abstract:**
Untargeted metabolomics datasets in LC-MS/MS present a large number of unidentified peaks. Typically, less than 10% of all deconvoluted metabolic peak clusters are identified. Using retention times as orthogonal information is important in workflows for compound annotations because each orthogonal parameter increases the confidence level in compound identification. Five different machine learning algorithms were employed and integrated into the Retip method: Random Forest, Bayesian Regularized Neural Network, Keras, XGBoost, and LightGBM. Retention time prediction models were developed for the two most common separation principles, reversed phase (RP) and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC). Two large publicly available datasets, the FiehnLab HILIC (n=981) and RIKEN PlaSMA (n=852) retention time databases, were used for training. For both chromatographic databases, the XGBoost method was the most accurate, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) on the testing set of 1.14 min for HILIC and 0.69 min for RP. The Retip R package also significantly reduces the number of false-positive compounds by 26.5% and increases the correct identification rate by 21%. Retip has been integrated into the mass spectrometry software tools MS-DIAL and MS-FINDER, allowing for a complete compound annotation workflow. Retip can be freely downloaded from the CRAN repository as an R package. Predicted retention times increase the confidence for peak annotations in liquid chromatography and subsequently lead to improved biological interpretations in metabolomics.

**Co-Authors:**

**Abstract:**
Untargeted and targeted lipidomics are complementary approaches that, when combined, achieve in-depth and comprehensive lipidome characterization and quantification. These approaches are usually performed on two different mass spectrometer platforms: triple-quadrupole (QqQ) type MS and high-resolution MS. Here, we developed a robust lipidomics workflow merging both targeted and untargeted approaches on a single liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-time of flight system (LC-QqTOF) platform with scheduled parallel reaction monitoring (sPRM). sPRM assays integrate both untargeted profiling from MS1 scan and targeted quantification obtained from MS/MS data. With a scheduled algorithm and maximum 100 precursors multiplexed per duty cycle, sPRM assay can achieve high-throughput targeted monitoring of more than 250 lipid species within a single injection. This workflow enabled the identification and quantification of more than 700 lipid species from 25 lipid classes at the level of fatty acid/long chain base/sterol composition with three injections in a barley root extract. To demonstrate the workflow, a study on salt stress-induced changes in the barley root lipidome was initiated, along with the discovery of novel lipid species in the group of oligohexosylceramides. Results show that 232 targeted compounds and 888 unknown features were found to have significantly responded to salt stress. This emerging targeted and untargeted lipidomics strategy, combined in a single workflow, provides novel insights into lipidomics and its applications in addressing biological questions.

**Co-Authors:**
- Divya Kattupalli, Luis AJ Mur, Nigel W Hardy, Biswapriya B Misra, Chuan Lu

**Abstract:**
Direct infusion mass spectrometry (DIMS) is a widely used platform capable of producing a global fingerprint of the metabolome without requiring a prior chromatographic step, making it ideal for wide-scale, high-throughput metabolomics analyses. Metabolite identification is a challenging task that involves querying masses against a metabolite database to retrieve putative metabolite annotations. Each existing metabolite database differs in coverage, format, and accessibility, often limiting users to a rudimentary web interface with no means of programmatically interfacing with the database. Consequently, researchers often manually combine multiple search results for a single experiment, making the exploration of potentially hundreds of masses arduous and infeasible for many projects. To facilitate unified access to metabolite information, we created the Direct Infusion MEtabolite database (DIMEdb), a comprehensive web-based, programmatic metabolite database containing over 80,000 metabolites sourced from renowned metabolite databases. DIMEdb is freely available at https://dimedb.ibers.aber.ac.uk.

**P-260: Optimization of Caenorhabditis Elegans Homogenization and Extraction Methods for Non-targeted Metabolomics Using Orbitrap and FT-ICR Mass Spectrometry**

**Presenting Author:**

**Co-Authors:**

**Abstract:**
Metabolomics commonly uses analytical techniques such as NMR and LC-MS to quantify and identify metabolites related to biological alterations. Metabolome coverage from non-targeted LC-MS studies relies heavily on the pre-analytical protocols used, impacting which metabolites are successfully measured and, thus, the biological conclusions drawn. Protocol standardization remains a challenge in the metabolomics community due to the variety of sample types and workflows. Previous studies have demonstrated that homogenization and extraction methods can produce large variations in the total number of metabolites detected, precision, and yield. To systematically determine the effects on metabolome coverage, artifact production, and experimental variation, different homogenization methods and extraction solvents (methanol, ethanol, 2:1 chloroform:methanol, and 9:1 ethyl acetate:ethanol) were examined using a mixed-stage *Caenorhabditis elegans* sample. The results provide insights into the optimal methods for non-targeted metabolomics using Orbitrap and FT-ICR mass spectrometry.
