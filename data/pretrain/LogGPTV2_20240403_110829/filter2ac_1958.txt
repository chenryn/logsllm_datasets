title:blackhat:asia-22 The Virtual Battlefield in 2022: Russia-Ukraine War &#38; Its Policy Implications
Information is key to human survival. Therefore, information warfare is an inherent part of human conflict. Nation-states run thousands of computer network operations every day. Some are designed to support democracy and human rights. Others are meant to target and terrify innocent civilians. Governments defend enormous gray zones where Internet-enabled crime, espionage, and war are hard to differentiate, and law enforcement, intelligence, and military agencies do not know who is responsible for what. NATO has recognized cyberspace as a domain of warfare similar to land, air, and sea. This talk examines the latest research and prevailing norms in law, operations, strategy, and technology. It includes a deep dive into the cyber dimension of the war between Russia and Ukraine, covering military strikes, information operations, and attacks on civilian critical infrastructure.
