The San Francisco Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) has an ad-hoc Communications Advisory subcommittee, 
established in 2006, that includes some local, state, and federal agencies (e.g., public health, state police, U.S. Coast 
Guard [USCG]).  From the documentation, the decision-making group responsible for the regional interoperable 
communications is not clearly designated (e.g., Communications Advisory Committee, Technical Working Group, 
Communications Working Group).  There are some formal agreements (e.g., Golden Gate Incident Action Plan) and a 
mix of formal and informal partnerships among agencies in the UA.  The continued development of documented 
agreements would support the formalization of these partnerships to ensure clear roles and responsibilities relating to 
communications interoperability issues and decisions.  The area is beginning to develop a strategic plan for regional 
interoperable communications that includes additional agencies in the area.  This strategy, as it gets adopted, can also 
support the prioritization of goals so that funding can be planned accordingly.  Through federal grant funds, the 
organizations within the San Francisco UA give some consideration to interoperable communications when procuring 
equipment and are working to develop a diversified and sustainable funding plan.  The level of support from UA 
leadership for regionwide interoperability is growing, but continues to face the challenge of focusing on day-to-day, 
agency-specific communications needs.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Clarify the roles, responsibilities, and relationships of the governance groups (e.g., San Francisco UASI, Bay Area 
Super UASI Group, Communications Advisory Committee, Communications Working Group, Technical Working 
Group) identified in the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP)  
• 
Establish Communications Working Group through a formal charter, include all local, public support, state, and 
federal agencies (e.g., USCG) and document roles and responsibilities as part of the group 
• 
Continue to develop, document, and formalize agreements (e.g., signed memoranda of understanding [MOU] with 
defined roles and responsibilities) among all participating agencies relating to regional interoperability 
• 
Reference all applicable agreements (e.g., MOUs, intergovernmental agreements) in the TICP, store them in an 
accessible format and establish a regular review process so they remain current and relevant 
• 
Continue to develop, document, and implement a regional strategic plan (beyond the operational focus of the TICP) 
with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance, that takes into account a long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) funding 
strategy  
• 
Continue to align local and state strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met 
• 
Begin to broaden and champion a governance structure that will support regional communications interoperability, 
and involve senior regional government leadership on long-term funding plans

The San Francisco UA TICP represents the first formal interoperable communications regional SOPs; however, the 
TICP takes into account various set of law enforcement SOPs and other informal procedures for interoperability as 
reported by area officials.  Participation in the development of the plan was originally limited in the public safety 
agencies involved, and the area has acknowledged that, although they have helpd workshops, they need additional 
support to better disseminate the TICP to area agencies (e.g., distribute to all included agencies and dispatch centers).

During the TICP validation exercise, participants experienced procedural difficulties (e.g., limited use of shared 
channels, gateway activation/deactivation problems, incorrect channel assignment) that highlight the need for increased 
training on the procedures for interoperability.  Regarding command and control SOPs, the San Francisco UA began the 
process of implementing National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) less than 1 
year ago, which implies that the UA is still in the earlier stages of implementing NIMS/ICS policies and procedures.  
During the exercise, participants demonstrated familiarity with these processes; however, they encountered some 
problems related to command and control (e.g., ICS Form 205 was not distributed; there was no clear delineation of 
unified command roles and responsibilities, incident command was established but not announced until a later time).  
The UA has prioritized the continued development and exercises of command and control SOPs, which shows their 
dedication to continued strengthening of their interoperable capabilities. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Develop regional communications interoperability SOPs (beyond the TICP) with participation by first responder 
agencies from across all applicable jurisdictions and disciplines 
• 
Distribute and put SOPs into practice through regular training, exercises, and usage (e.g., to address gateway 
activation issue) 
• 
Dispatchers should conduct drills on enabling, establishing, and disabling all methods for achieving interoperable 
communications 
• 
Consider scheduling a regular review and update process of developed policies and procedures 
• 
Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit implementation 
consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain and maintain NIMS/ICS 
compliance 
• 
Evaluate compliance with NIMS/ICS during all future exercises

The San Francisco UA frequently uses its available means of interoperable communications (e.g., shared channels, 
gateways, and shared systems).  During the TICP validation exercise, participants demonstrated familiarity with the 
interoperable communications equipment.  However, there were some difficulties activating console patches.  Despite 
the UA’s demonstrated successes, the TICP validation exercise was limited to local, regional, and minimal state 
participants.  Assessing the degree to which the local agencies in the UA can easily use interoperable communications 
equipment with state and federal agencies was therefore not possible.  While the exercise met the stated requirements, 
the area is encouraged to build on its success by further integrating state, federal, tribal, and support agencies in future 
tests. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Regularly test and exercise deployment of and procedures for regional interoperability resources (e.g., activation of 
console patches) to improve proficiency 
• 
Consider including additional state and federal agencies (e.g., Federal Bureau of Investigation, USCG) in future 
exercises and day-to-day use 
• 
Consider adding interoperable communications as an evaluation component for all future exercises and day-to-day 
activities

The UA uses an 800 megahertz trunked system that supports a majority of users in the area.  Several shared channels 
are available as well, especially in the very high frequency band.  The UA has a limited number of radio caches and 
gateways available for use.  San Francisco is working with other UASI sites in the Bay Area to upgrade and integrate 
their respective microwave backbones.  The connectivity will allow the different sites to integrate their systems for 
improved interoperability in the UA.

The San Jose UA Security Initiative (UASI) Advisory Working Group works in conjunction with the Silicon 
Valley Regional Interoperability Project (SVRIP), which developed the Tactical Interoperable 
Communications Plan (TICP).  The SVRIP includes local, state, and federal agencies (e.g., Pacific Gas and 
Electric, San Jose Mayor’s Office, California Highway Patrol, and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, 
and Explosives) and actively recruits new members.  The area has formal agreements and partnerships 
among all public safety organizations in the area. The San Jose UASI Advisory Working Group’s Executive 
Steering Committee annually reviews its regional strategic plan for interoperable communications, and is 
working to create an expanded regional emergency communications plan that will include San Jose, 
Oakland, and San Francisco.  In addition to federal funds, the San Jose UA uses local resources for lifecycle 
costs (e.g., communications equipment, operations and maintenance).  Organizations within the area develop 
budgets and procure equipment according to the regional strategic goals.  The senior level-leaders in the area 
serve as interoperability advocates and act to ensure continued political and fiscal support for the area.  
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to align local, regional, and state strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional 
interoperability needs are met 
• 
Continue to development and implement a regional approach to long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) sustainable 
funding that is consistent with the strategic plan 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Advanced Implementation 
The San Jose UA incorporated existing policies and procedures into the TICP (e.g., Santa Clara County Fire 
Mutual Aid, Bay Area Mutual Aid Channels policies).  The area has taken steps to disseminate these policies 
and procedures to all participating organizations and also has plans to update the SOPs as pilot technologies 
(e.g., Voice over Internet Protocol [VoIP]) are implemented.  The San Jose UA began implementing National 
Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) more than 1 year ago, and policies 
include fire, law enforcement, emergency medical services, and public works organizations in the training.  
During the TICP validation exercise, participants demonstrated familiarity with NIMS/ICS, but experienced 
minimal difficulties (e.g., Unified Command established but not announced, Communications Unit Leader 
roles and responsibilities not clearly designated).  As a best practice, the area should be commended for the 
development of the TICP training video and the formalized Action Plans for continued SOP training.

The UA regularly uses the available means of interoperable communications (e.g., radio cache, gateways, 
and shared channels) during day-to-day, task force, and mutual aid incidents.  Officials in the area report 
proficiency in real-world events (e.g., 2005 demonstration in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties).  During 
the TICP validation exercise, the participants demonstrated familiarity with the equipment and successfully 
established interoperable communications.  However, despite an overall successful exercise, there were 
difficulties.  For example, a shared channel failed, and because there was no pre-published backup 
communications plan, the channel was assigned as a resource before it was repaired.  Despite these 
challenges, the UA should be commended for its willingness to stress its communications systems and truly 
challenge its capabilities during a robust exercise.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Regularly test and exercise deployment of and procedures for regional interoperability resources (e.g., 
ICS Form 205 not distributed, radio cache not used) to improve proficiency  
• 
Consider adding interoperable communications as an evaluation component for all future exercises and 
day-to-day activities

Currently, the agencies within the UA field a variety of communications systems, including ones that use the very high 
frequency, ultra high frequency, T-Band, and 800 megahertz bands.  Interoperability is achieved through a system 
called Bay Area Mutual Aid Communications System (BayMACS).  This system provides an area wide simulcast of all 
four frequency bands bridged together. 
The UA, through the SVRIP, has taken a short-term approach by developing a “roadmap to interoperability.”  The 
roadmap takes a “system of systems” approach that includes a number of independent and interconnected interoperable 
communications solutions.  These include: 1) adding additional channels to the BayMACS; 2) constructing a 19-site 
digital microwave system that will serve as backhaul for future interoperable communications; 3) interconnecting a Bay 
Area-wide digital microwave Emergency Communications system for regional interoperability; and 4) conducting a 
pilot demonstration project to interconnect three agencies’ disparate computer aided dispatch systems as part of a 
regional interoperability information broker system, using information sharing to augment voice interoperability. 
The UA has also developed a mid-term approach.  A networked gateway system will be installed to allow for additional 
bridging of existing systems using VoIP.  Long-range planning efforts include movement to a shared system.

The newly combined Orange County Urban Area (UA) includes the core cities of Anaheim and Santa Ana, 
32 other Orange County cities, 2 state universities and the County of Orange.   
Governance: Advanced Implementation  
The Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) was created under the authority of the Orange 
County Operational Area; previously established committees (e.g., 800 megahertz [MHz] Governance 
Committee, 800 MHz Technical Liaison Committee, Orange County Chiefs of Police and Sheriff’s 
Association, Orange County Fire Chief’s Association) are responsible for key decisions and 
recommendations relative to policy, training, exercises, compliance, establishment of special committees, 
and operational issues within the UA.  The governance structure developed by the Orange County UA can 
serve as a model for other jurisdictions based on its breadth of local and state participation, frequency of 
meetings and reviews, and ability to address near-term needs and long-term interoperability goals.  As 
documented in Section 2 of its TICP, there is a clear authority flow for interoperable communications 
decisions, which is inclusive of all local first responder organizations.  The UA has proactively included 
multiple state and federal agencies in its interoperability solution through its Countywide Coordinated 
Communication System; however, the extent of the governance group’s formal interaction with federal 
agencies is not stated.  Additionally, the Orange County UA has a regional interoperability strategic plan in 
place that has been accepted by all participating agencies, is reviewed annually, and can address funding if 
future interoperability enhancements are required.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to seek formalized participation from and coordination with state and federal agencies in 
governance bodies 
• 
Continue to review and regularly update agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding) to ensure 
appropriate agency participation 
• 
Continue to identify long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) funding sources to support interoperable 
communications

The policies for use of the Orange County shared system are long established and were effectively 
documented in Section 3 of the TICP.  SOPs have been disseminated to all included agencies and dispatch 
centers, and distributed through the TICP Implementation Workshop.  The use of these system SOPs was 
well demonstrated during the TICP validation exercise.  The exercise did show the need for further 
development of gateway SOPs.  The UA indicated that it has been in the process of implementing the 
National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) for less than one year, 
which implies that the UA is in the earlier stages of implementing NIMS/ICS policies and procedures.  
During the TICP validation exercise, participants demonstrated familiarity with NIMS/ICS processes (e.g.,

The Orange County UA regularly conducts multi-agency responses using its shared system.  The TICP 
validation exercise participants were able to successfully establish interoperable communications (e.g., 
shared systems were used effectively, dispatch maintained fully interoperable communications with all first 
responders).  Despite demonstrated successes and although the TICP validation exercise met set standards, 
broader state and federal agencies were not widely included.  Assessing the degree to which the local 
agencies in the UA can easily use interoperable communications equipment with state and federal agencies 
was therefore limited.  The UA is encouraged to build on its success by further integrating state, federal, and 
support agencies in future tests.  Further demonstrating fluency and familiarity with interoperable 
communications solutions connecting local agencies with state and federal agencies would follow through on 
the recommendation in the post-exercise Improvement Plan that states that “Now that excellence with intra-
county communications has been demonstrated, exercise and evaluate communications links with agencies 
from state, federal, and outlying jurisdictions on other radio systems.” 
Recommendations: 
• 
Consider expanding exercises to integrate state and federal entities  
• 
Continue to expand and/or document additional methods to interoperate with state and federal agencies 
in the UA (e.g., Naval Weapons Station) 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

Anaheim and Santa Ana, California public safety communications are supported by the Orange County’s 800 MHz 
mixed-mode trunked radio system.  All public safety agencies in the Orange County UA have talk groups on this 
system, which includes 81 channels with 400 talk groups and 16,000 radios.  Given that the current radio system in 
Orange County provides for the highest possible level of interoperability (shared system), the next step would be to 
upgrade to a countywide Project 25 system.
