User: How to use Git for version control? Please describe the basic Git operation instructions and what they do.
Assistant: Git is a distributed version control system, mainly used for collaborative development, source code management, etc. The basic Git operation instructions include: 1. `git init` Initialize the Git warehouse Function: Create a new Git warehouse in the current directory. 2. `git add` Add files to the temporary storage area Function: Add the modified file to the temporary storage area, ready to submit. 3. `git commit` Submit changes to the local warehouse function: submit the changes in the temporary storage area to the local warehouse, and generate a new submission record. 4. `git push` Push local changes to remote warehouse Function: push the changes in the local warehouse to the remote Git warehouse, and share the changes with other developers. 5. `git pull` pulls the modification function of the remote warehouse: pulls the modification from the remote Git warehouse and merges it with the local warehouse. 6. `git clone` Clone the remote warehouse to the local function: copy the remote Git warehouse to the local, and create a new local warehouse. 7. `git branch` creates a branch function: Create a new branch in the current warehouse. 8. `git checkout` switch branch function: switch the current branch to the specified branch. 9. The role of `git merge` to merge branches: Merge the modifications of the specified branch with the current branch. 10. `git log` Check the submission record Function: display the submission record of the current branch, including submitter, submission time and other information. Through the above basic Git operation instructions, version control and collaborative development can be effectively realized.
