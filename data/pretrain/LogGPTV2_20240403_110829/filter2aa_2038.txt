The Death of Cash
The Death of Cash
 Synopsis and Preview of my next book “THE DEATH OF CASH”
due out in 2009.
 How government forces, strong crypto and globalization of
financial systems will conspire to eliminate cash from our economy.
 Why this is a BAD thing?
 Evaluation of pros and cons of next generation financial systems.

Bold claims
Bold claims
   Cash, as a store of financial value will be dead in the US
within 20 years.
 Old Theory:  The government will outlaw cash, then only
the criminals will have cash.
 New Theory:  Cash will die a natural death; we will willingly
abandon it for more convenient financial tools.
6
Why?
Why?
 Credit/debit is convenient.
 Credit/debit seems more modern, techy.
 Credit/debit is easy to spend.
 Credit/debit is being pushed relentlessly by everyone
from the government to banks to big business.

 thing?
 Loss of anonymity.
 Loss of control to government, banks, big business.
 Bad for your financial health.
 Bad for national security?...

What is cash?
What is cash?
 Paper Money
 Coinage – Some coins cost more to produce than they are actually worth
(1c=1.23c, 5c= 5.73c).
 Checks – Treated the same as cash, since they are hard to track, hard to verify,
and not really a part of the global electronic financial network.  That may change
with the Check21 law.  In the near future, all checks will required to be converted
to electronic images, electronically rendered and then destroyed.  Good bye Float!

Why the government hates cash
Why the government hates cash
 It’s dirty (germs, coke, bird flu).
 Expensive to make, wears out quickly.
 Relatively easy to counterfeit (even though the govt. is one ahead
in the game).
 Most importantly, anonymous (hard to track!).
10
Why banks hate cash
Why banks hate cash
 Hard to handle, easy to steal.
 They have to track it differently, lots of special requirements and
regulation.
 They don’t make anything on the handling of it.
 In fact, they have to pay for the clearing of paper checks.
11
Why Banks hate cash
Why Banks hate cash
 Most of all, banks make money on every debit card transaction.
 Each bank gets some, plus the intermediary network; the
businesses pay the fees, raising your prices to compensate.
 This amounts to about a 1-3% weight on our economy.
 All for giving us access to our “money”.
12
Why Big Business hates cash
Why Big Business hates cash
 Again, cash and checks are expensive to handle.
 People tend to spend more when they use a card.  You don’t run
out of “card” in  your wallet.
 E-transactions create credit card profiles and credit bureau
reports and make for useful marketing tools.
13
The Debit/Credit Society
The Debit/Credit Society
 We are going through a transformation from a hard asset culture (gold
standard, coins worth money) to a debit/credit culture
 Your net worth is carried on a electronic balance sheet on a server
somewhere.
 What happens to your net-worth if those systems are down or hacked?
14
The Sub-Prime Economy?
The Sub-Prime Economy?
 This is blurring the line between what you owN and what you owE
Example:  check bouncing protection (which is really just a high
interest loan), Home Equity lines of credit.
 Moving us as individuals towards the model of high finance,
highly leveraged, nobody really knows who owns what.
 We see how that worked out for them (the mortgage crisis, the
SL&L bailout, etc)
15
The Wonderful Gift Cards
The Wonderful Gift Cards
 Why Gift cards suck..
 Cant be used universally (usually tied to a store)
 They expire
 Sometimes have “fees” for every use
 The phantom revenue
 Purchases made with gift cards usually exceed the value of the card
 Many cards are never redeemed.
 Why they don’t suck..
 Easy to buy, no thought required (remember “it’s the thought that counts”?
 Good for online purchases (itunes,  second life money.. And pron!)
16
Industry PR campaign against cash
Industry PR campaign against cash
 The Visa and MC ad campaign’s goal is to vilify cash and move everyone
to a credit/debit lifestyle.
 Is paying with cash really harder than swiping your card, entering your
pin, selecting cash back,  ok’ing the transaction total, etc?
 The whole point is to make cards cool, cash uncool and collect a small %
of every transaction.
 Why is Microsoft  looking into its own e-payment system?   It knows a
good business when it sees one!
17
The 
The New
New Monopoly
 Monopoly
 The new version of the famous board game has
done away with play money.
 Now you use a card to swipe for your Real
estate purchases.
 Same thing with “LIFE” and several others
 In real “life”, our children won’t know what
cash is.
18
The Utopian version of the Cash Free Society
The Utopian version of the Cash Free Society
 No more petty crime.
 No more organized crime.
 No more terrorism.
 No more tax returns.
19
The Dystopian version
The Dystopian version
 The government can follow you anywhere. Imagine trying to move about with out
cash.  No gas, no hotels, no purchases of any kind.
 Marketing companies have an exact profile on you.
 The IRS doesn’t go away, it just has had more direct access to your money.
 Organized crime evolves to becomes the “banker” of the underground, providing a
facility for illegal transactions
20
US Code Title 18, Part 1, Chapter 95
US Code Title 18, Part 1, Chapter 95
 Do you realize that it is illegal to transport over $10,000 in cash
into or out of the US without declaring it?
 It is considered money laundering and is punishable by up to a
$500,000 fine and/or 20  years in jail.
21
Cash Transaction Reports
Cash Transaction Reports
 The Banks have been deputized by the government to catch criminals by
monitoring the cash supply
 The Patriot Act and the Bank Secrecy Act requires banks to report
“suspicious” transactions.
 What counts as “suspicious”?  Any cash transaction over $10,000 must be
reported in a Cash Transaction Report (CTR).
 This also applies to many cash businesses (car dealerships, casinos, etc)
for transactions under $10K.
22
More on 
More on CTRs
CTRs
 But, in reality, the actual amount they track is around $3,000.
 This unpublished limit is used to catch those using multiple transactions
to stay under official limit.
 Banks use special software to track cash deposits across time and at
multiple branches, etc.
23
SAR s
SAR s
 Not the Asian Flu
 Banks are also required by law to file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR)
on any kind of cash or financial transaction that they deem suspicious for
ANY REASON.  Even those under the limits.
 They can’t get in trouble for filing, but they can if they miss something.
 Since the onus is on the banks to file, they tend to err on side of filing
rather than not.
24
Financial profiling
Financial profiling
 What counts as suspicious?
 It is totally arbitrary
 I like to go to Las Vegas.  If I withdraw a large amount of cash to play
with, does that make me a criminal?
 If I don’t like the government knowing where I travel by air, does that
make me a terrorist?
 Using cash to buy an airline ticket is a “flag”, along with one-way tickets,
for HLS dept reports
25
Catching 
Catching Eloit
Eloit Spitzer
 Spitzer
 Do you remember the fate of our erstwhile governor of NY and former star prosecutor of
corruption caught using high dollar call girls?
 How was he caught?
 Laid low ( no pun intended) by a SAR which was filed on him as he wire transferred
money to pay for his prostitutes!

friend (in this case)
 The eventual e-currency system will probably be implemented using some
form of strong crypto.
 Imagine something like a smart card with your whole personal net-worth
on it.  Your Personal Credit Meter.
 Imagine using nothing but E-dollars.
 Modern Crypto is based on tough math problems…We all know what
computers are getting faster and faster at doing (not just playing video
games).

 Breakthroughs in technology could undermine the whole financial system.
Example:  Quantum Computing.
 That’s not counting other hacking , cracking and other e-mischief.
 Imagine the web without SSL…
 Its a lot easier to steal a zillion 0 and 1s than a  huge bunch of cash.
28
The coming Liquidity Crisis
The coming Liquidity Crisis
 A cash free society is also a danger to national security.  How?
 Our economic transaction networks are becoming more and more
vulnerable to an electronic outage as we depend less and less on hard
cash.
 The cashless society may make for convenience and smoother transaction
processes, but it does not weather crisis well.
 No matter if the crisis is accidental or intentional.
29
Liquidity Crisis example
Liquidity Crisis example
 On August 5th, 2007, a large portion of Wells Fargo Bank’s system went
down.
 Most branches had no access to their core system and lost most bank
functionality.  They were crippled.
 They were unable to cash checks unless they knew you and even then only
for small amounts.
30
The new Liquidity Crisis
The new Liquidity Crisis
 Of course,  ATM + debit cards didn’t work, either.
 Checks Bounced, Bill Payments weren’t sent
 There was no way of overriding this because of built-in “safeguards”.
 This meant:
No gas
No groceries
No restaurant meals
No hotel check in or plane flights…
Or anything else normally paid for with a debit card.
 Welcome to the Cashless Society!
31
The new Liquidity Crisis
The new Liquidity Crisis
During regional disasters, it may impossible to use debit and credit cards, due to lines being down.
It may also be impossible to get cash, since ATM machines might be unable to “phone home”.  Even
if they are up, they will soon run out of cash.
During Hurricane Rita, a total non-disaster for the Houston area, ATM machines near me were soon
empty.
I live in an interior suburban neighborhood, not near any major route.
32
Liquidity Terrorists
Liquidity Terrorists
Imagine a concerted attack on 2 or 3 of our largest banks.
A large portion of the US would be unable to transact business.
Take away our consumerism…MASS PANIC!
33
Use of cash is declining sharply
Use of cash is declining sharply
 Non-cash payments exceeded cash in 2007, for the first time.
 Use of checks is also declining sharply.
 Debit/Credit cards are now the dominant forms of payment in the U.S.
34
Exceptions:  Where Cash is still King
Exceptions:  Where Cash is still King
 Vegas, baby! (not for long…)
 Border areas.
 Anywhere there is a large immigrant population.
 Why?  Because they want to remain under the radar of the government
(another reason the government hates cash!).
35
What this means for the Future
What this means for the Future…
…
 Your financial life will be reduced to a set of numbers stored in a
computer somewhere
 More emphasis on this “personal financial algorithm” rather than
common sense and experience.
 Why?   It helps big corporations and financial institutions avoid law suits
and use low cost employees rather than experienced professionals who
will be making major decisions about your life.
36
What this means to you
What this means to you…
…
 There is already a single e-number that has a huge influence on
your life..
 Your credit score.
 Think about the things that can be provided or denied you based
on this:
 Housing
 Automobiles
 Access to credit
 Employment (yes, many corporations use credit reports now as a
factor in hiring)
37
What can you do?
What can you do?
 Use cash wherever you can, whenever you can, while you still  can.  You may
find you spend less!
 I’m not saying forgo the e-economy; that’s pretty much impossible at this
point unless you living in a shack.
 Just try using cash more often. Leave less of an e-trail of yourself.
 In a climate where calling a foreign country or being an large stakes
gambler can make you a “person of interest”,  try to sculpt your e-profile to
only the positive and benign things.
38
What can you do?
What can you do?
 Keep a cash stash for emergencies,  $1-10K (don’t get or use it all at once or
you may trigger a CTR).
 Keep alternative value stores for a rainy day (gold, vintage X-men comics,
whatever..).
 Use alternate methods of payment (PayPal, e-gold, barter).
 Lindens??   Risky!
