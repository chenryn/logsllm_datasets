User: I want to fetch the commit message to my bitbucket repository each time a user is doing any push operation.
How can I do that?
I am in development version. So is there any way by which I can post to localhost/someurl for each commit from my repository.
Else suggest other ways by which I can achieve this.
Thanks in advance for help.
Assistant: Select the administration menu for the repository (the gear symbol), then Services. There you can set up integration with external services, such as email or twitter.
