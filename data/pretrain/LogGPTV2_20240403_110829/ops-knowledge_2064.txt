User: How to analyze the memory consumption and CPU usage of the application at runtime for performance optimization?
Assistant: 1. Memory consumption analysis: (1) Monitor the memory usage of the application to determine whether there is a memory leak or memory overflow. (2) Use memory analysis tools, such as jprofiler, MAT, etc., to analyze the object creation, object life cycle, object size, and reference relationship of the application. (3) Check the causes of memory leaks, such as incorrect use of cache, improper reuse of objects, etc. 2. CPU usage analysis: (1) Monitor the CPU usage of the application to determine whether the CPU is too high. (2) Use CPU analysis tools, such as VisualVM, jconsole, etc., to view the CPU usage of threads and the CPU usage of methods. (3) Optimize CPU usage, such as reducing unnecessary loops, optimizing algorithms, using thread pools, etc.
