Abstract
The  objective  of  the  panel  is  to  discuss  the  urgent
need,  the  means,  the  progress,  the  obstacles,  and  the
challenges in creating a structured representation of the
contents  of  the  large  and  very  rapidly  increasing  set  of
documents  that  represent  knowledge  in  the  technical
domain of dependability.
1. The Need: Sometimes We Don’t Know
What We Are Talking About
Dependability  has  concerned  most  disciplines  of
computer  science  and  engineering  since  the  early  days.
As  a  consequence,  significantly  different  terminologies
were developed by different communities to describe the
same aspects of dependability. The terminologies became
entrenched  through  usage  at  annual  conferences,  in
books,  journals,  research  reports,  standards,  industrial
handbooks and manuals, patents, and other documents.
As  an  illustration,  we  have  the  concepts  of
dependability,  trustworthiness,  survivability,  high
confidence,  resilience,  high  assurance,  robustness,  and
self-healing,  whose  definitions  appear  to  coincide  or  to
overlap  extensively.  In  many  cases  the  definitions  have
multiple  versions  that  depend  on  a  given  author’s
preference.
The  use  of  several  synonyms  or  near-synonyms  that
lack  well-defined  distinctions  often  is  a  source  of
continuing  confusion  that  leads  to  re-inventions  and
plagiarism,  impairs  the  transfer  of  research  results  to
practical  use  and  blocks  the  recognition  of  related
documents.
The orderly progress of dependability research and its
practical  applications  requires  that  past  work  as  well  as
new results should be classified on the basis of a single
ontology  and  thus  made  visible  and  accessible  to  all
communities of the dependability discipline.. However, it
is unreasonable to expect that a committee formed by the
different communities would by volunteer effort create a
taxonomy  document  from  which  a  single  consensus
ontology could be generated.
An example of a long-term “manual” effort to create a
framework of dependability concepts is the effort within
IEEE CS TC/DCFT and IFIP WG 10.4 that began with a
special  session  at  FTCS-12  in  1982,  and  since  then  has
resulted  in  several  papers,  a  six-language  book  (1992),
and in 2004 the paper “Basic Concepts and Taxonomy of
Dependable and Secure Computing” (IEEE TDSC, vol. 1,
no.1, January-March 2004).
Useful as it may be, this “Taxonomy” paper represents
only  one  of  the  dependability  communities.  It  seems
apparent  that  today  the  purely  “manual”  (i.e.,  human)
process  of  ontology  building  for  dependability  concepts
is  reaching  its  limits.  The  complementary  solution  is  to
augment the human effort by the use of automatic natural
language  processing  tools  that  have  been  developed  by
computer  linguists.  The  next  step  must  be  computer-
aided building of a consensus ontology.
2. The Means and Progress:  Natural
Language Processing by Computers
During the past decade much progress has been made
in  the  development  of  computer  tools  for  natural
language processing. Such tools have been developed for
the extraction of term candidates from a corpus, i.e., a set
of texts from a domain of interest.
A thesaurus (list of important terms with related terms
for  each  entry)  is  constructed  from  the  term  candidates.
The  ontology  for  a  given  domain  is  a  data  model  that
represents those terms and their relationships. Automatic
indexation of the texts is carried out using the thesaurus,
followed  by  clustering  analysis  using  statistical  and
linguistic  techniques.  A  measure  of  similarity  between
texts  is  computed  that  serves  as  a  basis  for  automatic
classification.
The  applicability  of  those  techniques  to  texts  in  the
dependability  domain  is  currently  investigated  at  the
Center  for  Computer  Linguistics  of  Vytautas  Magnus
University  in  Kaunas,  Lithuania,  using  the  tools
developed  at  the  Institute  for  Applied  Information
Research at Saarland University in Germany. The effort
is part of research supported by the European Network of
International Conference on Dependable Systems & Networks: Anchorage, Alaska, June 24-27 20081-4244-2398-9/08/$20.00 ©2008 IEEE440DSN 2008: AvizienisExcellence  ReSIST  (Resilience  for  Survivability  in
Information Society Technologies).
  The  corpus  is  composed  of  nearly  2000  papers  and
other  texts  from  the  Proceedings  of  all  29  FTCS  and  7
DSN  conferences  (1971-2006).  Term  extraction  yielded
over 20000 term candidates. When only the abstracts of
the  papers  were  processed,  about  5700  term  candidates
were  extracted  for  the  computer-aided  construction  of  a
thesaurus and ontology. The thesaurus was employed to
perform  automatic  indexing  of  the  FTCS  and  DSN
papers,  followed  by  the  identification  of  about  180
clusters  by  means  of  automatic  clustering  analysis.
Currently  automatic  synonymy  extraction  experiments
are  conducted  using  four  approaches.  Next  an ontology
will  be  constructed  and  used  to  do  automatic
classification  experiments  with  the  FTCS  and  DSN
papers.
The encouraging result of the processing of texts from
the  FTCS/DSN  community  leads  to  the  conjecture  that
similar  processing  of  texts  from  other  conferences,
journals, books, industrial documents, etc., will produce
other  ontologies  that  can  be  merged  into  a  consensus
ontology for the entire discipline of dependability.
3. The Obstacles: Classification Is a Problem
for All of CS&E
A dependability ontology is an integral part of an (still
non-existent)  ontology  for  all  of  computer  science  and
engineering.   The  only  existing  and  widely  used
taxonomy  that  could  be  used  to  build  it  is  the  ACM
Computing Classification System (CCS).   The CCS was
created in 1988 and was last revised in 1998. It has fallen
far  behind  the  evolution  of  CS&E  and  information
technology.  The  concepts  of  dependability  are  treated
very  inadequately,  and  many  significant  dependability
terms  are  altogether  missing  in  the  1998  ACM  CCS
taxonomy.
Most documents that deal with dependability refer to
“the dependability of X”, where X is: hardware, software,
system  architecture,  database,  etc.   These  upper-level
terms  of  the  CS&E  ontology  must  be  available  when
classifying dependability documents. The existing CCS is
a severe handicap, but it must be used until a better one is
available.  At  this  time  the  ACM  is  initiating  the  next
update of the CCS, with one goal being the development
of a flexible incremental process of updating.
4. The Grand Challenge
The coming update of the CCS is a grand challenge to
the  dependability  community:  we  must  take  part  in  the
process  of  creating  an  up-to-date  and  evolvable  version
of  the  CCS  that  adequately  incorporates  dependability
concepts. The new CCS would allow the computer-aided
construction of a thesaurus and an ontology for the entire
CS&E profession. However, we must put our own house
in  order  first:  a  consensus  dependability  ontology  with
explicit synonymy relations must be available to the CCS
builders.  The  prize  to  be  gained  is  also  grand:  a
“researcher’s  assistant”  (or  “referee’s  helper”)  that  uses
the  ontology  to  search  the  immense  collection  of  past
publications  for  relevant  references  in  the  dependability
domain.
5. From the Dark Side: the Info-Skeptic's
View
A  different  view  of  the  CS&E  ontology  problem  is
also possible. The info-skeptic says: all concepts, systems
and theories that deal with information are human-made,
in contrast to natural phenomena that exist as given facts
to be investigated by the physical sciences. Therefore the
disappearance  of  a  CS&E  concept  is  simply  a  case  of
survival of the fittest: if the concept’s originator was not
able  to  assure  its  survival,  then  someone  else  will
rediscover it in due time. Thus there is no need to keep
track of what was done in the past, because the good stuff
will reappear, with some luck… in my research.
