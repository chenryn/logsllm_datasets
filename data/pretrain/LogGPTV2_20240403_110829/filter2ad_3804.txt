## Abstract
This panel discussion aims to address the urgent need, means, progress, obstacles, and challenges involved in creating a structured representation of the extensive and rapidly growing body of documents that encapsulate knowledge in the dependability domain.

### 1. The Need: Clarifying Terminology
Dependability has been a concern across various disciplines of computer science and engineering since their inception. As a result, different communities have developed distinct terminologies to describe similar aspects of dependability. These terminologies have become entrenched through their use in annual conferences, books, journals, research reports, standards, industrial handbooks, manuals, patents, and other documents.

For example, terms such as dependability, trustworthiness, survivability, high confidence, resilience, high assurance, robustness, and self-healing often have overlapping or coinciding definitions. In many cases, these definitions vary based on the author's preference. The use of multiple synonyms or near-synonyms without well-defined distinctions leads to ongoing confusion, reinvention, plagiarism, and hinders the transfer of research results to practical applications.

To ensure the orderly progression of dependability research and its practical applications, past work and new results must be classified using a single ontology, making them visible and accessible to all communities within the dependability discipline. However, it is unrealistic to expect that a committee formed by these diverse communities would voluntarily create a comprehensive taxonomy document from which a consensus ontology could be generated.

An example of a long-term manual effort to create a framework of dependability concepts is the initiative within IEEE CS TC/DCFT and IFIP WG 10.4, which began with a special session at FTCS-12 in 1982. This effort has resulted in several papers, a six-language book (1992), and the paper "Basic Concepts and Taxonomy of Dependable and Secure Computing" (IEEE TDSC, vol. 1, no.1, January-March 2004).

While this "Taxonomy" paper is valuable, it represents only one community within the dependability field. It is clear that the purely manual process of building an ontology for dependability concepts is reaching its limits. A complementary solution is to augment human efforts with automatic natural language processing tools developed by computational linguists. The next step should be the computer-aided construction of a consensus ontology.

### 2. The Means and Progress: Natural Language Processing
In recent years, significant progress has been made in developing computer tools for natural language processing. These tools can extract term candidates from a corpus, which is a set of texts from a specific domain.

A thesaurus, a list of important terms with related terms for each entry, is constructed from the term candidates. An ontology for a given domain is a data model that represents these terms and their relationships. Automatic indexing of the texts is performed using the thesaurus, followed by clustering analysis using statistical and linguistic techniques. A measure of similarity between texts is computed, serving as the basis for automatic classification.

The applicability of these techniques to texts in the dependability domain is currently being investigated at the Center for Computer Linguistics of Vytautas Magnus University in Kaunas, Lithuania, using tools developed at the Institute for Applied Information Research at Saarland University in Germany. This effort is part of research supported by the European Network of Excellence ReSIST (Resilience for Survivability in Information Society Technologies).

The corpus consists of nearly 2000 papers and other texts from the Proceedings of all 29 FTCS and 7 DSN conferences (1971-2006). Term extraction yielded over 20,000 term candidates. When only the abstracts of the papers were processed, about 5700 term candidates were extracted for the computer-aided construction of a thesaurus and ontology. The thesaurus was used to perform automatic indexing of the FTCS and DSN papers, resulting in the identification of about 180 clusters through automatic clustering analysis. Currently, experiments are being conducted to automatically extract synonyms using four approaches. Next, an ontology will be constructed and used to perform automatic classification experiments with the FTCS and DSN papers.

The encouraging results from processing texts from the FTCS/DSN community suggest that similar processing of texts from other conferences, journals, books, and industrial documents will produce additional ontologies that can be merged into a consensus ontology for the entire dependability discipline.

### 3. The Obstacles: Classification in Computer Science and Engineering
A dependability ontology is an integral part of a broader (yet non-existent) ontology for all of computer science and engineering. The only existing and widely used taxonomy is the ACM Computing Classification System (CCS), created in 1988 and last revised in 1998. The CCS has fallen behind the evolution of CS&E and information technology, inadequately treating dependability concepts and missing many significant terms.

Most documents dealing with dependability refer to "the dependability of X," where X can be hardware, software, system architecture, databases, etc. These upper-level terms of the CS&E ontology must be available when classifying dependability documents. The existing CCS is a severe handicap but must be used until a better one is available. The ACM is currently initiating the next update of the CCS, with the goal of developing a flexible incremental process for updates.

### 4. The Grand Challenge
The upcoming update of the CCS presents a grand challenge to the dependability community. We must participate in creating an up-to-date and evolvable version of the CCS that adequately incorporates dependability concepts. The new CCS would enable the computer-aided construction of a thesaurus and ontology for the entire CS&E profession. However, we must first establish a consensus dependability ontology with explicit synonymy relations. The ultimate prize is a "researcher's assistant" (or "referee's helper") that uses the ontology to search the vast collection of past publications for relevant references in the dependability domain.

### 5. The Info-Skeptic's View
An alternative perspective on the CS&E ontology problem is offered by the info-skeptic, who argues that all concepts, systems, and theories dealing with information are human-made, unlike natural phenomena. Therefore, the disappearance of a CS&E concept is simply a case of survival of the fittest. If the concept's originator could not ensure its survival, someone else will rediscover it in due time. Thus, there is no need to keep track of past work because the good stuff will reappear, perhaps even in one's own research.
