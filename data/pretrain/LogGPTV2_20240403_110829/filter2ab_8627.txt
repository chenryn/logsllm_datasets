**ATT&CK ID:** T1218.009  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Regsvcs/Regasm

Adversaries may exploit `regsvcs` and `regasm` to execute malicious code through trusted Windows utilities. These command-line tools are designed to register .NET Component Object Model (COM) assemblies. Both `regsvcs` and `regasm` are typically digitally signed by Microsoft, which can make them appear more trustworthy and evade detection by security software.
