Figure 6: MFCCs of the same audio sample taken from three different handsets manufactured by the same vendor. We can see that some of
the coefﬁcients vary signiﬁcantly, thus enabling us to exploit this feature to ﬁngerprint smartphones.
6.5 Same Maker-and-Model Devices
In this section, we look at ﬁngerprinting smartphones manufac-
tured by the same vendor and are of the same model. From Table 2
we see that we have 15 Motorola Droid A855 handsets which is the
largest number among all the other different types of smartphones
in our collection. We therefore use these 15 devices for all the ex-
periments in this section. We found that ﬁngerprinting smartphones
of the same maker-and-model was relatively a tougher problem.
We again look at ﬁngerprinting these devices, ﬁrst, through the mi-
crophone and speaker individually and then by combining both the
microphone and speaker.
6.5.1 Feature Exploration
First, we determine the dominating subset of acoustic features
that can be used for ﬁngerprinting smartphones of the same model.
To obtain the ﬁngerprinting data we record audio clips played from
15 Motorola Droid A855 handsets. Each type of audio is recorded
10 times giving us a total of 150 samples from the 15 handsets; 50%
of which is used for training and the remaining 50% is used for test-
ing. Table 8 shows the maximum F1-score achieved by each acous-
tic feature for the three different types of audio excerpt. The table
also highlights the dominating subset of features selected by our
sequential feature selection algorithm. We again ﬁnd that MFCCs
are the dominant features for all categories of audio excerpt.
6.5.2 Fingerprinting using Speaker
We now look at ﬁngerprinting the 15 Motorola Droid A855 hand-
sets. Table 9 highlights our ﬁndings. We test our ﬁngerprinting
approach against three different forms of audio excerpt. We use
the acoustic features obtained from our sequential feature selection
algorithm as listed in Table 8. From Table 9, we see that we can
achieve an F1-score of over 94% in identifying which audio clip
originated from which handset. Thus ﬁngerprinting smartphones
through speaker seems to be a viable option.

6.5.3 Fingerprinting using Microphone
We now investigate ﬁngerprinting similar smartphones manufac-
tured by the same vendor through microphone-sourced input. We
again use 15 Motorola Droid A855 handsets for these experiments.
We use the features obtained through Algorithm 1 which are listed
in Table 8. Table 10 shows our ﬁndings. We see similar results
compared to ﬁngerprinting speakers. We were able to achieve an
F1-score of 95% in identifying the handset from which the audio
excerpt originated. Thus ﬁngerprinting smartphones through mi-
crophones also appears to be a feasible option.
