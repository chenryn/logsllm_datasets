Hello,
I just found out a bug. When you've created a navbar with dropdown links, when
you select a link in the dropdown (form Mobile version), it doesn't select the
link, but closes the collapsible dropdown.
Visual example:  
| Link #1  
| Link #2  
| Dropdown  
|_ Dropdown Link #1  
|_ Dropdown Link #2
So, if you select the "Dropdown Links", it's closes the collapsible Dropdown,
but not redirecting to the "Dropdown Links".
