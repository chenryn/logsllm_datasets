# Trusted Runtime Environment (TRuE): A Secure Loader and User-Space Sandbox

## Introduction
This paper introduces the Trusted Runtime Environment (TRuE), which combines a secure loader and a user-space sandbox to provide a robust, low-overhead security framework. TRuE aims to protect applications from various security exploits by integrating a secure loading mechanism and dynamic security guards.

## Key Features and Design
### Secure Loader
- **Basic Functionality**: The secure loader is designed with minimal functionality, reducing the attack surface and protecting against common exploits.
- **Safe Loading**: Ensures that only verified code is executed, seamlessly integrating Software Fault Isolation (SFI) into the loading process.
- **Security Hardening**: Replaces the standard loader with a hardened, bare-bones implementation, mitigating vulnerabilities often exploited in the standard loader.

### User-Space Sandbox
- **Dynamic Security Guards**: Executes application code under the control of dynamic security guards, ensuring that all code regions and shared objects are monitored.
- **Shared Information**: The sandbox and loader share information about the application, enabling better control and security.
- **Indirect Control Flow Transfers**: Reduces the overhead and limits jump-oriented programming attacks by removing many indirect control flow transfers between modules.

## Implementation Details
- **System Call Authorization**: Various techniques such as `ptrace` support, trusted kernel code, and binary translation can be used to implement system call authorization.
- **User-Space Isolation**: Provides an additional layer of security by isolating the application from the rest of the system.
- **Dynamic Systems**: Adds guards and checks to running applications, working at different levels of granularity.
- **Full System Virtualization**: Encapsulates a complete running system, providing a coarse-grained level of security.
- **System Call Interposition**: Works at the granularity level of individual applications and their system calls, providing fine-grained control.

## Related Work
Table V provides a summary of related work, distinguishing features, design, and implementation details of various approaches:
- **Dynamic Binary Translation (BT)**: Supports dynamic and static BT, kernel module or kernel support, and compiler extensions.
- **Monitor Stack**: Has a separate stack for permission checks or code translation.
- **IA32 Subset**: Implements a subset of IA32 without FPU, MMX, SSE, and 3-byte opcodes.
- **Static Policy**: Uses a hard-coded policy, intercepting only open and `execve` calls.
- **Return Instruction**: Ensures that `ret` targets instructions immediately after any call instruction.
- **Comparable Approaches**: MAPbox, SubDomain, and Consh use similar methods.

## Conclusion
TRuE offers a secure and efficient way to create and control applications in user-space. By integrating a secure loader and a user-space sandbox, it provides a strong foundation for safe software-based fault isolation. This approach bridges the security context of programming languages and operating systems, enabling language-independent secure execution of applications.
