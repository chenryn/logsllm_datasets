Randomly couldn't connect to my VPS, it was working literally hours ago, and I haven't done anything out of the ordinary. What would be the most likely problem?

Edit: I do remember accidentally doing sudo chmod -R 777 /var/. According to the second answer on ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host /var/log/btmp should be 600, but I do not have btmp in my /var/log dir

Assistant: I accidentally did chmod 777 -R on /var/. 

Was able to connect again by doing chmod 755 -R /var/ 
There are still some abnormalities so those I had to manually change the mode
