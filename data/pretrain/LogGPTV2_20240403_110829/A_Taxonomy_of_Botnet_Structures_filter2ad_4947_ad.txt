### 3.4 Empirical Analysis

Our taxonomy also suggested that available bandwidth \( B \) is a useful metric for botnet utility. We note that estimating the end-to-end bandwidth for hosts in a botnet is a complex task. Nonetheless, to demonstrate the utility of our proposed metric, we estimated the available average bandwidth in two botnets.

#### Bandwidth Estimation

Using techniques described in [16], we measured one botnet with approximately 50,000 unique members in February 2005 and estimated the bandwidth of 7,326 bots chosen in a uniformly random manner. Similarly, we measured the bandwidth of a 3,391-member subsample from a 48,000-member botnet in January 2006.

We used the tmetric [7] tool to perform the bandwidth estimation. This tool uses successively larger probes to estimate the bandwidth to a host. We conducted these measurements using a high-capacity link (OC-48) close to our network’s core routers, ensuring that we were more likely to measure the end host’s available bandwidth rather than any limitations in our internal network. Dozens of probes sent over several minutes were used to obtain an average. While the networking community has developed more sophisticated techniques for end-to-end bandwidth estimation, our simple measurements provided a first-order approximation of the average bandwidth in an entire distributed network.

#### Results and Implications

Figures 5(a) and (b) show the distribution of bandwidth, including the minimum, maximum, and average bandwidth values observed during the probes. Table 2 summarizes the average available bandwidth that the botmaster can utilize from a single bot. Using Equation (1) and without considering diurnal sensitivity, we calculated the average available bandwidth for the botmaster to use on one bot as approximately 53.3004 Kbps for the first dataset. For the second dataset, the average is 34.8164 Kbps, slightly lower than the first case.

When accounting for diurnal sensitivity and assuming the average online times for each class of bots are [2, 4, 24] hours, the final average bandwidth for the botmaster on one bot is 22.7164 Kbps. For a botnet with 50,000 members, the botmaster consistently has more than 1 Gbps of bandwidth on average at any time. This suggests that the botnet could easily launch a successful denial-of-service (DDoS) attack on almost any website. During our observation period, the 50,000-member botnet did indeed DDoS several websites that only had 100 Mbps transit. For the second dataset, the weighted bandwidth is 14.6378 Kbps, which is comparatively lower.

The metric reveals a counter-intuitive aspect of botnets. From the sampled bandwidth in Figures 5(a) and (b), it might seem that the botnets have roughly the same maximum bandwidth and similar numbers of bots, suggesting they have the same general utility from a DDoS perspective. However, when accounting for diurnal changes in populations, the second botnet (plotted in Figure 5(b)) has approximately half the average available bandwidth, despite having only 2,000 fewer members than the other network. If network administrators had to prioritize a response effort between these two botnets, the simple bandwidth estimate \( B \) shows a higher utility in the botnet in Figure 5(a).

#### Future Work

Our bandwidth estimate metric may have other uses beyond prioritizing botnets. This exercise suggests that diurnal changes in botnet membership can significantly affect a botnet’s utility as a DDoS vehicle. We leave for future work an analysis of how this metric can be leveraged in a targeted attack on a botnet. Specifically, we speculate that responders might significantly reduce a botnet’s DDoS potential by targeting the “high-speed” members of a botnet. The bandwidth \( B \) metric should allow researchers to measure their progress in such a response and determine how many more high-speed members must be removed relative to the mix of low-speed members, given an estimated diurnal usage pattern.

### 4 Related Work

Our work fits into the broader literature addressing the statistical mechanics of complex networks [4]. Other studies have examined the brittle nature of scale-free networks and the resilience of random networks in various contexts [5, 23, 40]. Our work adapts these findings to the specific domain of botnets. The topology of networks under active decay was analyzed in [40], and many of its results anticipate our own. The authors in [40] explored a wide range of network structures, including terror cells and global history, not just computer networks. By focusing on botnets, we identified several unique and interesting phenomena not considered in [40]. For example, the authors in [40] suggest a strategy of splitting high-degree nodes to avoid targeted responses, which is analogous to increasing \( C \) in scale-free networks, discussed in Section 3. Our focus on botnets allowed us to further observe that this strategy results in degraded transitivity.

Botnet research is still maturing. The work in [13] anticipated many of the general categories of botnets analyzed in Section 2, including the difficulty in responding to different types of botnet taxonomies. The models and empirical data we presented in Section 2 flesh out and formalize the intuitive discussion in [13]. Recently, advanced botnets with complex network structures have been studied. Vogt et al. [54] presented a super-botnet, a network of many independent, small botnets, which is a special case of a random graph botnet. Wang et al. [55] introduced an advanced hybrid peer-to-peer botnet. Grizzard et al. [19] provided an overview of P2P botnets and a case study of a specific bot.

Several works have focused on botnet measurement. In [17, 46], the authors used honeynets to track existing IRC-based botnets and reported some simple statistics about botnets. Rajab et al. [47] argue that estimating botnet size is challenging in practice and call for further research on botnet measurement. We believe our analysis in Sections 2 and 3 helps address this problem. Wang et al. [55] propose two metrics, connection ratio and degree ratio, to measure the resilience of removing mostly-connected bots from a botnet.

In this paper, we propose a new metric, the average available bandwidth \( B \), which provides valuable insights into the utility and potential of botnets.
