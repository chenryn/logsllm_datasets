Abstract—The increasing popularity of virtual reality (VR) in
a wide spectrum of applications has generated sensitive personal
data such as medical records and credit card information. While
protecting such data from unauthorized access is critical, directly
applying traditional authentication methods (e.g., PIN) through
new VR input modalities such as remote controllers and head nav-
igation would cause security issues. The authentication action can
be purposefully observed by attackers to infer the authentication
input. Unlike any other mobile devices, VR presents immersive
experience via a head-mounted display (HMD) that fully covers
users’ eye area without public exposure. Leveraging this feature,
we explore human visual system (HVS) as a novel biometric
authentication tailored for VR platforms. While previous works
used eye globe movement (gaze) to authenticate smartphones or
PCs, they suffer from a high error rate and low stability since
eye gaze is highly dependent on cognitive states. In this paper,
we explore the HVS as a whole to consider not just the eye
globe movement but also the eyelid, extraocular muscles, cells,
and surrounding nerves in the HVS. Exploring HVS biostructure
and unique HVS features triggered by immersive VR content can
enhance authentication stability. To this end, we present OcuLock,
an HVS-based system for reliable and unobservable VR HMD
authentication. OcuLock is empowered by an electrooculography
(EOG) based HVS sensing framework and a record-comparison
driven authentication scheme. Experiments through 70 subjects
show that OcuLock is resistant against common types of attacks
such as impersonation attack and statistical attack with Equal
Error Rates as low as 3.55% and 4.97% respectively. More
importantly, OcuLock maintains a stable performance over a 2-
month period and is preferred by users when compared to other
potential approaches.

INTRODUCTION
Virtual reality (VR) technology is boosting exponentially.
The market size of VR has witnessed an increase of 178%
from 2016 to 2018 [51]. By interacting with head-mounted
displays (HMD), a user can enjoy immersive virtual content,
making VR become a new personal computing paradigm [33],
[55]. Due to the diverse applications of VR in entertainment,
healthcare, education, and military, sensitive data can be ac-

cessed via HMD. For example, credit card information is
often stored in HMD for the convenience of games and add-
ons purchase in VR App stores [38]. In medical applications,
patients’ CT scan models have been viewed in VR HMD to
assist the diagnosis of structural abnormalities on human body
[24]. Stimuli
implying patients’ traumatic experience have
been displayed in VR during psychological exposure therapies
[54]. In military applications, pilots learn the operation of
top-secret aircrafts in VR simulator [46]. Protecting HMD
from unauthorized access thus becomes critical in guaranteeing
users’ experience and privacy in VR systems [52].
Unfortunately, VR computing is still at its infancy and
state-of-the-art HMD authentication methods suffer funda-
mental limitations in security. Recent systems have adopted
traditional unlock pattern, PIN, and graphical passwords in
VR through new input modalities such as remote controllers
and head movement navigation [36], [13]. Similarly, common
behavior biometrics such as head movement [28], [44] and
body motion [40] were also proposed to authenticate users.
However, all these systems expose the entire authentication
action to the public, making various attacks possible through
observation. For example, adversaries have successfully con-
ducted side-channel attacks by observing user input behavior
and inferring the virtual input [14], [30]. Since wearing HMD
blocks users’ real-world visuals and decreases their situation
awareness [17], the threat of observation-based attacks in VR is
signiﬁcantly higher than that in traditional computing devices.
We envision an unobservable solution that utilizes the
distinctive human visual system (HVS) for VR authentication.
Since human eyes are fully covered by HMD without public
exposure, it is unlikely, if not impossible, for nearby adver-
saries to observe users’ eye activities and execute observation-
based attacks. While eye gaze biometrics have been used in
PCs and smartphones [41], [45], [47], [56], harnessing HVS for
stable VR authentication remains challenging. The error rate of
previous eye gaze based authentication is still high (e.g., EER
of 6.3% [45]) and the performance quickly degrades over time
[47]. One likely reason is that eye gaze pattern, as a behavioral
biometric, varies when a user attempts the authentication under
different cognitive states and such variability becomes more
signiﬁcant as time passes by.
In this paper, we propose to explore the HVS as a whole
to build a stable and unobservable VR authentication system.
We utilize the fact that in addition to the eye globe many
other components in the HVS such as the eyelid, extraocular
muscles, cells, and surrounding nerves conduct unique activ-
ities that can be triggered and sensed in VR environment. In
addition to the unobservable nature, comprehensive analysis
of the entire HVS in VR also enhances the authentication
performance. First, unlike prior eye gaze biometrics that only
focused on the movement of eye globe [41], [45], [47], [56],
considering the physiological characteristics of various HVS
components in the authentication can enhance the performance
stability since HVS biostructure is far less dependent on the
time-varying cognitive states of users. Second, some less-
intuitive features of HVS cells and nerves (besides traditional
eye gaze) not presented in physical reality can be triggered
by immersive VR content [39] and utilized to increase the
distinctiveness among users. These unique and temporally
stable features consequently improve the average error rate.
Realizing such a biometric authentication system for VR
HMD is non-trivial. While eye globe movement has been
captured by previous works using monitor-mounted eye track-
ers or high-resolution cameras in an illuminated open space,
we must
trigger and measure low-level activities of HVS
components that are not clearly visible but uniquely presented
in dark VR environment. To tackle this challenge, we propose
an electrooculography (EOG) based HVS sensing framework
for VR. EOG measures the electrical signals resulted from
biological activities in the HVS and can characterize both
behavioral and physiological features of the HVS in VR
environment. Since the foam face cover of current VR HMD
has direct contact to eye sockets and their surrounding nerves,
we attach thin electrodes on the cover to measure low-level
HVS signals which are otherwise unavailable via eye trackers
or video cameras in the context of PCs and smartphones. We
also design a set of visual stimuli to trigger EOG signals that
manifest desirable HVS features.
Another challenge of the proposed authentication system
is that discriminative features must be extracted from the
comprehensive HVS data for efﬁcient model
training and
reliable authentication. Previous biometric systems [29], [19],
[7] trained a two-class classiﬁer to differentiate the owner
and others, but a new model had to be trained for every
new owner. We propose a different authentication scheme to
remove the model training and owner enrollment overhead.
Speciﬁcally, EOG is ﬁrst processed to recognize common HVS
activities and extract a suite of symbolic features representing
the behavior and biostructure of various HVS components.
Each feature of the input will be compared with that of the
owner’s record to generate a matching score. The matching
scores for all features are fed to a comparator to indicate if
the input matches the owner’s record. That way, we only need
to train one comparator and can use it for all future owners.
We validate the proposed authentication system, referred as
OcuLock, through extensive evaluation. During our evaluation
that involves 70 subjects and lasts for 2 months, we validate the
stability, security and user preference of OcuLock. In the secu-
rity analysis, the system achieves Equal Error Rates of 3.55%
and 4.97% against impersonation attack and statistical attack
respectively. The reliability study over a 2-month period shows
that the model can maintain a far more stable performance
than existing eye gaze behavior based approach. Moreover, the

user study demonstrates that OcuLock is preferred over other
authentication approaches due to its convenience, security, and
social comfort.
To summarize, the contributions of this paper include:
• We propose an EOG-based framework to measure the
HVS as a whole for VR authentication, where visual
stimuli are designed to trigger the HVS response and
EOG is collected to characterize the HVS.
• We design a record-comparison driven authentication
scheme, where distinctive behavioral and physiologi-
cal features are extracted and accurate authentication
decisions are made.
• We perform an extensive evaluation of the proposed
OcuLock system including reliability performance of
the authentication, security analysis against several
attacks, and user study of VR HMD authentication.
II. BACKGROUND
A. Human Visual System
As shown in Figure 1, human visual system (HVS) is
primarily comprised of four components: eyelid, eye globe,
their surrounding tissues, and extraocular muscles, as well
as the bidirectional connecting pathways to the visual cortex
and other parts of the brain. The eyelid opens and closes
regularly to expose the cornea to the outside, giving vision
to humans. The eye globe absorbs incoming light through
the cornea (its outermost layer of tissues) and shines it on
the retina (its innermost and light-sensitive layer of tissues).
After the retina transduces the received images into electric
pulses, the connecting pathway delivers the pulses to the brain.
Conversely, the brain and the nervous system can also send
control signals to extraocular muscles, which contract or relax
to motivate the eye globe rotation and the eyelid movement.
For example, signals from the sympathetic nervous system are
received by eyes to trigger the reaction of alert [26].
Since the size, shape, position, and anatomy of the HVS
vary from person to person [21],
these HVS components
and their daily interaction present unique features that can
distinguish people. The opening and close of the eyelid are of
different extent and speed due to the distinctive muscle strength
of HVS among people [1]. Similarly, the eye globe rotation for
each individual is only able to reach a limit determined by the
size and shape of the eye globe [53]. In order to transport
nourishing substances to the retina and remove wastes via the
connecting pathway, a layer of cells in the posterior part of

to conduct metabolism. The metabolic rate of RPE depends
on the activeness of cells, which is unique among individuals
[49]. Finally, the sympathetic signals transported to the eyes
show unique energy patterns dependent on the biostructure of
people’s sympathetic nerves [26].
Apart
from the aforementioned physiological
features,
HVS also involves voluntary movement
that demonstrates
discriminative patterns. Eye globe typically has two basic types
of movement, where ﬁxations are sessions when eyes maintain
a stationary gaze on a single location and saccades are sessions
between two ﬁxations when eyes move in the same direction
quickly. The trace of ﬁxations and saccades generates the scan-
path, which varies among people and is uniquely inﬂuenced
by individuals’ personal emotion and preference [41]. Since
immersive VR display triggers different eye globe movement
from traditional display [39], comprehensive analysis of eye
gaze could beneﬁt the authentication.
Building on these facts, we conclude that HVS contains
unique physiological biostructure and voluntary movement to
authenticate VR users. While the eye globe movement was
individually used as gaze biometrics, we consider the HVS as
a whole in this paper to explore low-level visual activities and
the interaction among HVS components.
B. Electrooculography
Electrooculugraphy (EOG) measures the electric voltage
variance between two sensing positions on the skin near
human eyes [5]. The voltage variance is resulted from standing
potential (shown in Figure 1), a steady electric potential ﬁeld
existing between cornea (positive pole) and retina (negative
pole). The standing potential
is formed by transepithelial
potential (TEP), the difference of electric potential between
two sides of RPE cell membrane, which is originally caused
by the metabolism of RPE in the HVS.
As EOG measures the cornea-retinal standing potential that
exists between the front and the back of the eyes, it is closely
related to all major components of HVS. If the eye globe
moves from the center position toward one of the two EOG
sensing positions, this sensing position becomes closer to the
positive side (front) of the eye globe and the opposite sensing
position becomes closer to the negative side (back). Assuming
that the resting potential is constant, the recorded potential
between the two sensing positions is a measure of the eye’s
rotating angle [4]. Similarly, when eyelid moves, the electric
pulses generated by extraocular muscles cause a rapid rise
and drop of voltage in the eye area which can be detected
by EOG [1]. EOG is also able to measure the activeness of
RPE cells and sympathetic nerves as the standing potential
is highly inﬂuenced by the RPE metabolism and sympathetic
signal transportation. [49], [26]. Therefore, it is feasible to
exploit EOG to measure the characteristics of HVS.
III. PROBLEM STATEMENT
A. System Model
We assume a general VR viewing scenario as shown in
Figure 2. The system includes an owner and a VR HMD. The
VR HMD is equipped with electrodes to collect EOG signals.

Fig. 2: A general VR viewing scenario.
The VR HMD analyzes the EOG data and compares it with the
owner’s record to make the authentication decision. The VR
HMD that processes EOG data and authenticates users cannot
be forced to run unintended code. The owner is enrolled to
this VR HMD during which she views the visual stimuli by
moving her eyes around. Templates of EOG records for all
enrolled owners are stored in the VR HMD. The enrollment
is a secure process.
The system involves a visual channel between the attacker
and the owner. The attacker can observe who is using the
HMD and thus know the identities of all enrolled owners. The
attacker can also visualize the owner’s head and body motion if
there is any. However, since the owner’s eyes and surrounding
areas are fully covered by the HMD without public exposure,
adversaries cannot observe the displayed content or the owner’s
eye movement without alerting the owner.
B. Threat Model
their children [16]. We also assume that
We assume a powerful adversary who has enough time
and space to freely perform attacks. As HMD is a detachable
device that can be unplugged and carried along, attackers
can steal the device and conduct attacks in another place.
Furthermore, many unauthorized purchases via VR HMD are
made by people who are known to the owners without ill
intent, e.g.,
the
attacker has not installed malware in the HMD to monitor the
input. The attacker has not attached additional hardware to the
HMD to capture signals. We do not consider the attack that
requires nearby complicated device either, e.g., the attack using
an antenna near the target HMD to capture electromagnetic
emanations and infer user input. However, the attacker may
utilize other methods to indirectly obtain information related
to user input, e.g., by statistical attack. The objective of the
adversaries is to input EOG either directly or indirectly to the
VR HMD in order to bypass the authentication. We consider
the following types of attacks.
•
•
Impersonation Attack: After observing the owners’
authentication action, the attacker puts on the HMD
and impersonates one of the enrolled users in the
system. The attacker then attempts the authentication
by providing her own EOG signal.
Statistical Attack: The adversary obtains the statistics
about EOG signals for a population similar to the
victim owner. The attacker forges new EOG records
