### Strategic, Conceptual, Logical, and Technical Perspectives in Service Modeling

**Strategic Perspective:**
The strategic perspective employs mind maps to represent information across various levels of abstraction. This method facilitates the elicitation and organization of information in a structured manner.

**Conceptual Perspective:**
The conceptual perspective primarily utilizes UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams, which provide a semi-formal graphical notation. Changes in one model must be propagated to other affected models that contain overlapping information. This task is both time-consuming and challenging due to the need for each model to be aware of and adjust to changes.

**Logical Perspective:**
The logical perspective relies on formal notations to describe services. This ensures precision and clarity in the representation of service logic.

**Technical Perspective:**
The technical perspective uses formal languages such as BPEL (Business Process Execution Language) and WSDL (Web Services Description Language). These languages are essential for defining the technical aspects of services in a standardized and machine-readable format.

### Model Dependencies and Integration

To manage the dependencies between models, we classify them into two categories: vertical and horizontal.

**Vertical Dependencies:**
Vertical dependencies address the synchronization of models at different levels of abstraction within the same dimension. This involves transforming information between multiple representations of artifacts, ensuring consistency across layers.

**Horizontal Dependencies:**
Horizontal dependencies focus on the synchronization of models at the same level of abstraction but across different dimensions. These dependencies describe how models from different dimensions, which refer to the same artifacts, are synchronized.

### New Languages and Notations

**Service Property Notation:**
A domain-specific language that describes services from a provider's perspective in a non-technical manner. It includes information about capabilities, pricing, delivery channels, ratings, legal aspects, and provider details to facilitate service discovery.

**Universal Service Description Language (USDL):**
An XML specification that captures business, operational, and technical information related to a service. USDL is designed to provide a comprehensive and standardized description of services.

**Canonical Abstract Prototypes (CAP) Editor:**
Provides an abstract description of user interface structures, enabling the creation of consistent and reusable UI components.

**Service Archive (SAR):**
An XML schema that defines how to bundle technical models for deployment. SAR files are generated by the ISE Workbench and deployed on a service runtime environment.

### Model Transformations

**Model Transformation in ISE Workbench:**
The ISE Workbench supports model transformations to ensure flexibility, speed, and accuracy in design. Given that the union of all models defines a service, they must be integrated and synchronized. This integration faces challenges due to the involvement of multiple stakeholders and the increasing complexity of models.

**Automatic Model Synchronization:**
We propose using model transformations to automatically integrate and synchronize models. This approach reduces complexity, effort, and errors in modeling a service using ISE. The ISE Workbench uses MDA (Model Driven Architecture) to support model transformations, leveraging mature concepts, well-established infrastructure, and OMG standards like QVT (Query, View, and Transformation) and ATL (ATLAS Transformation Language).

### ISE Workbench Architecture

**ISE Workbench Components:**
- **Model Editors:** Tools for creating and editing models.
- **Model Repository:** Stores and manages models.
- **Model Transformation Engine:** Executes model transformations.
- **SAR Wizard:** Interacts with the Tradable Service Runtime (TSR) for deployment and execution.
- **Discovery Wizard:** Facilitates interaction with the Service Management Platform (SMP) for service discovery and composition.

**TEXO Portal:**
An end-user interface that allows users to negotiate service agreements, search for available services, and test and execute them. It does not have a direct connection to the ISE Workbench but is crucial for service provisioning.

### Running Example: Manage Desktop Hardware (MDH) Service

**Service Composition and Challenges:**
- **Service Identification:** The IT department needs to identify suitable services for realizing the MDH service.
- **Contextual Description:** The service should be described in a way that considers dynamic context, such as location and customer type.
- **SLA Compatibility:** Ensuring that the composite service meets the negotiated SLAs, even when individual services have their own SLAs.

**Process Pattern Matching:**
ISE supports the transformation of BPMN models to executable BPEL models. The designer can either assign existing services to tasks or specify goals for automatic service composition. The Parallel Activities Specification Scheme (PASS) is used to formally describe processes, enabling process pattern matching and automatic service composition.

### Verification and Validation

**Verification:**
- **Graph-Based Representation:** Suitable for finding candidate services but lacks a theoretical foundation.
- **CCS Transformation:** Models are transformed into CCS (Calculus of Communicating Systems) for advanced validation using tools like CWB-NC Workbench.
- **Behavioral Equivalence and Conformance Check:** Ensures that services can communicate and behave as expected in a valid composition.

By addressing these perspectives, dependencies, and transformations, the ISE framework provides a robust and flexible approach to service modeling and management.
