So I have structure of app like this
    index.ts
    package.json
**package.json**
worked
    {
      "scripts": {
        "test": "deno run index.ts"
      }
    }
not working
    {
      "scripts": {
        "test": "deno run index.ts"
      }
    }
I am not sure that whether or not `deno` will support execute script without
extension name in the future.
