User: How to achieve continuous integration and continuous delivery? Please list commonly used CI/CD tools and their characteristics, as well as practical application cases in engineering.
Assistant: Achieving continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) requires the help of related tools. The following are some commonly used CI/CD tools and their characteristics: 1. Jenkins: It is an open source CI/CD tool that can automate the construction, testing and deployment of software projects. It has the characteristics of high customizability, active community, and rich plug-ins. Application cases in engineering include: after the code is submitted to the Git warehouse, Jenkins automatically triggers operations such as building, running test cases, and checking code quality. If the verification passes, it will be automatically deployed to the production environment. 2. GitLab: It is a comprehensive platform including Git warehouse management, CI/CD tools and other functions. The pipeline (pipeline) that supports CI/CD can combine various stages. Application cases in engineering include: after the code is submitted, GitLab automatically triggers the pipeline to perform operations such as building, testing, packaging, and deployment. 3. Travis CI: It is a tool that provides free CI/CD services for open source projects. You can get the code from the GitHub repository, and automatically perform operations such as building, testing, and deploying in the cloud environment. Application cases in engineering include: using Travis CI to automate builds in GitHub-hosted open source projects. 4. CircleCI: It is a continuous integration and continuous delivery tool that supports multiple languages and frameworks. Applications can be automatically built, tested and deployed on cloud platforms. Application cases in engineering include: after the code is submitted to GitHub, CircleCI automatically triggers the build and runs the test case, and if the verification passes, it is automatically deployed to PaaS platforms such as Heroku. 5. Docker: It is a containerization platform that can package applications into container images for easy deployment and management. Used in conjunction with CI/CD tools, rapid builds, tests, and deployments can be achieved. Application cases in engineering include: using Docker to package applications into images, using CI/CD tools such as Jenkins to automatically build, test, and deploy container images to achieve continuous integration and continuous delivery. The above are commonly used CI/CD tools and their characteristics, and the actual application cases are also rich and varied. In development and operation and maintenance, by using these tools to build your own CI/CD process, you can improve development efficiency and product quality, and reduce operation and maintenance costs and human errors.
