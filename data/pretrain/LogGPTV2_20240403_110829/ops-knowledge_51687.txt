User: I do not want to use the fab command and don't use the fabfile & command line arguments.  I want to  make automated remote ssh using fab api by writing a python script.Can I automated this by writig python script?
Assistant: You can call your functions with importing your fabfile.py. At the end, fabfile is just another python script you can import. I saw a case, where a django project has an api call to a function from fabfile. Just import and call, simple as python :)
