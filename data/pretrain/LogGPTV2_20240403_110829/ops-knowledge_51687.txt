**User:** I do not want to use the `fab` command and avoid using the `fabfile` and command-line arguments. Instead, I want to automate remote SSH tasks using the Fabric API by writing a Python script. Can I achieve this by writing a Python script?

**Assistant:** Yes, you can automate remote SSH tasks using the Fabric API by writing a Python script. You can import and call the functions defined in your `fabfile.py` directly within your script. Essentially, a `fabfile` is just another Python script, so you can import and use its functions as you would with any other Python module.

For example, if you have a `fabfile.py` with a function like this:

```python
from fabric import Connection

def run_remote_command(host, user, command):
    conn = Connection(host=host, user=user)
    result = conn.run(command)
    return result
```

You can import and call this function in your main script:

```python
from fabfile import run_remote_command

# Example usage
result = run_remote_command('your_host', 'your_user', 'your_command')
print(result.stdout)
```

This approach allows you to leverage the Fabric API for remote SSH tasks while avoiding the use of the `fab` command and command-line arguments. It's as simple as importing and calling Python functions.
