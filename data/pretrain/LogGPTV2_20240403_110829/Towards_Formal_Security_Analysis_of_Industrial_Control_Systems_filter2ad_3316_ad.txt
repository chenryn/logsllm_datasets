ually open a component, and ST are the numbered steps of
the attack.
ST_1. systemStatus(p101,on)
ST_1. systemStatus(mv101,close)
ST_2. systemStatus(t101,low)
ST_3. HC_open[Component=mv101]
The goal can be trivially achieved by waiting that the level
of the water increases up to a level above low due to the in-
ﬂowing water. However, since CL-AtSe reports (only) the
ﬁrst attack trace found (not all the possible attack traces
leading to the same attack) and given that the water was
decreasing in the initial system status, CL-AtSe reports the
expected attack trace. We note that in practice, this process
usually reports a cyber attack (without any manual opera-
tion) even if a manual operation of a valve would be the
most straightforward attack. We assume this is due to the
implementation of CL-AtSe. In particular, CL-AtSe is an
implementation of the DY attacker model and the manual
operations are encoded in the attack model as Horn Clauses.
That diﬀerence between manual and cyberattacks could ex-
plain the cyberattacks to be found ﬁrst.
Changing Status of Components. The second set of at-
tacks is related to changing the status of a component. Most
of the components are aﬀected, since if the attacker sends
a malicious message to the component on behalf of a PLC,
then that component will change its status accordingly. As
an example, we have speciﬁed that in the initial state of
the system all the pumps are oﬀ and no water is ﬂowing in
the system. We have then deﬁned a security goal specifying
that a security violation occurs when the ﬂow meter FIT201
(placed after the pump P101) reports no ﬂow and the pump
P101 is on (the pump should not be on when there is no
water to pump out of the tank T101).
(cid:50)¬(systemStatus(f it201, noF low)∧
systemStatus(p101, on))
The communication in SWaT is not encrypted, thus an
attacker can change the payloads of messages without a key.
This leads both the Cybercriminal and the Insider to achieve
this goal and CL-AtSe reports the following attack trace.
systemStatus(fit201,noFlow)
i(plc1) -> p101 : open
However, several components can only be operated man-
ually (i.e., manual valves, drains). Thus, only the Insider is
able to open drains and manual valves. These manual op-
erations can be exploited in more sophisticated attacks (for
example, combining manual and network operations).
121Alter Chemical Dosing. With altering chemical dosing
we mean that the attacker can eﬀectively control the pumps
and LITs of process 2 (i.e., chemical dosing process). When
an attacker alters the behavior of a pump by, e.g., open
it when it should be closed, the chemical process is inﬂu-
enced. Considering the concentrations of chemicals in the
water would indeed be more accurate, but our current sys-
tem model does not permit such details.
We have, however, tested our formal speciﬁcation with
respect to goals related to the level of the chemicals in the
tanks in process 2. For example, we have deﬁned that the
chemicals in tank t201 cannot be below a threshold lowlow
as follows:
(cid:50)¬(systemStatus(t201, lowlow))
The attack traces reported by CL-AtSe are similar to the
ones already reported in this section.
Flow/Pressure Drop. The last set of attacks are related
to the pressure or ﬂow drops/increase. One way to achieve
these goals, is to trick the PLCs in reading fake values of
PITs or FITs. Another way is to prevent the water to ﬂow
through a PIT/FIT while a pump (after the PIT/FIT) is on.
If we specify an initial state of the system where the pump
P101 is on (lowering the water in T101) and we analyze the
speciﬁcation with respect to the following security goal:
(cid:50)¬(systemStatus(f it201, noF low)∧
systemStatus(p101, on))
CL-AtSe returns the following attack trace where the at-
tacker drops all the packets that should alert the PLC1 that
the level of the water in the tank T101 is decreasing until
the tank is empty. The attacker then opens the pump P101.
lit101 -> i(plc1) : low
lit101 -> i(plc1) : lowlow
lit101 -> i(plc1) : belowThreshold
i(plc1) -> p101
: open
5. PRACTICAL ASSESSMENT
A formal security assessment is performed over a system
model that abstracts away some of the details of the real
system. In order to concretely exploit on the real system the
attacks (or attack traces) found with a formal assessment,
one has to concretize those attacks. In other words, one has
to bridge the abstraction gap between the formalized system
and the real system. In CPS this is a very complicated task
due to the complexity of the system.
In this section, we
report a comparison between the results we have obtained
with our design-time analysis and the attacks found with
practical assessment.
5.1 Context of practical assessment
For the practical assessment, we invited six teams from
industry and academia to practically attack the real sys-
tem [2]. The teams could choose between three diﬀerent
attacker proﬁles to conduct the attack. In addition to the
insider and cybercriminal, a strong attacker proﬁle was avail-
able that we do not discuss further in this work. Each at-
tacker proﬁle had diﬀerent capabilities, beneﬁts and/or con-
straints following our proﬁles as outlined in Section 2. The
main goals that the teams have been challenged to achieve
are the following:
• Physical Process Goals, control over physical actuators
and processes, i.e., valve status, tank ﬁll level, pipe
pressure, chemical dosing.
• Sensor Data Goals, demonstrate control over sensor
readings at diﬀerent components, i.e., PLC, local dis-
play of sensor, PLC, HMI, SCADA, Historian.
Insider
The results of the attacks using the Cybercriminal and In-
sider attacker proﬁle are discussed next.
5.1.1 Cybercriminal
This attacker proﬁle has no physical access to the system
and then the team that chose this proﬁle could not manually
interact with the system (e.g., could not manually open a
valve). For the same reason they did not have access to the
L0 ring. In addition, no knowledge about the system and
no speciﬁc tools for the modiﬁcation of PLC logic have been
provided. Assuming an high level of hacking skills (accord-
ing to [31]) the team with this proﬁle have been provided
with a virtual machine with access to the L1 network. This
has been done to simulate a compromised machine. The of-
fensive capabilities of this attacker have not been limited,
i.e., ARP spooﬁng, exploits, brute force attacks have been
permitted.
5.1.2
By choosing this attacker proﬁle, the team has physical
access to the testbed and then to the tools that any em-
ployee could have access to (e.g., Studio5000 to read and
modify the logic of PLC). They can then physically manip-
ulate valves and change network topology. An Insider is
assumed to have password of all main components of the
system, for example, SCADA, and Historian. He also can
operate directly with the HMI/SCADA system. However,
the oﬀensive knowledge of an Insider is limited (with re-
spect to a Cybercriminal) and an Insider cannot perform
ARP spooﬁng or brute force attacks and he cannot use ex-
ploits. The hacking tools allowed with this proﬁle are limited
too and, for example, network scanners are not allowed (but
the attacker has previous knowledge of the system).
5.2 Attacks Found with Practical Assessment
During the practical assessment the teams have performed
the diﬀerent attacks following similar attack patterns. The
attacks on tank ﬁll level were performed with an Insider at-
tacker proﬁle by all teams. The teams have used the HMI
(as an Insider) to set the system (pumps and valves) in such
a way that the tank either over or under-ﬂowed. The same
technique has been exploited to perform attacks on pumps,
valves and chemical dosing. For the chemical dosing attack,
the attackers have kept open the pump responsible for the
chemical dosing of the water longer than the default time.
This should lead to an increasing of the chemicals in the
water that ultimately spoils the membrane in the reverse
osmosis process (process 5). However, precautionary proce-
dures were set up before the attacks in order to not spoil the
reverse osmosis process.
A number of DoS (Denial of Service) attacks have been
performed to attack PLCs or HMI/SCADA (e.g., by using
Ettercap [26]). One DoS was performed by physically dis-
connecting the Ethernet cable from one of the PLC. This
prevented the PLC to communicate with the system.
5.3 Formal vs. Practical Assessment
In this section, we compare the attacks found with our
formal technique (performed independently and before the
practical assessment) with the practical assessment. A gen-
eral overview is given in Table 4.
The attacks found from the practical assessment are very
similar to the ones we have found with our formal analysis
of SWaT. In 7 cases (on 8 total cases considered) the attacks
are exactly the same (on diﬀerent level of abstraction). Ex-
amples for those attacks are the ones on on pumps, valves,

chemical dosing, and tanks. However, due to the diﬀerent
level of abstraction of the two techniques, some of the details
of the attack strategies are diﬀerent. For example, during
the practical assessment, when an attacker wanted to send
spoofed values of one component to the PLC, he had to set
ﬁrst the PLC in manual mode. Manual mode enables the
PLC to accept messages from the HMI and then the attacker
can modify the payload of those messages. If manual mode
is not enabled, the messages of the attacker are overwritten
with the real message of the sensors [38]. Thus, an attacker
has to physically access the SWaT testbed and manually
switch the PLC to manual mode. In our formal analysis, we
have not considered such practical details. Therefore, some
of the attacks that can be performed with a Cybercriminal
proﬁle in our attack model, are not directly feasible in the
real system. While in the real system, a Cybercriminal could
perform the attack whenever the PLC is in manual mode,
he would potentially need to wait until someone with phys-
ical access to the PLC changes the default mode to manual
mode.
Summarizing, our formal analysis predicted the practical
attacks (apart from the ones to the HMI/SCADA that were
not considered in the attack model for performance issues).
Another interesting result is that with our attack model we
can easily predict that most of the attacks will still be pos-
sible even when adding cryptography and signature to the
communication between components. In addition, the map-
ping between the attacks found in the formal analysis are
not easily mapped to the real system (due to the techni-
cal details abstracted away in the attack model) but they
provide a quite accurate description of the outcome of the
attack, the components involved, the semantics of the mod-
iﬁcation in the payload, and often about the strategy of the
attacker.
6. RELATED WORK
In [31], a systematic analysis of the literature have been
performed to collect and categorize the main aspects of a
Cyber-Physical attacker model. The results have been im-
plemented in a free open-source tool available in [28]. How-
ever, the authors do not focus on how to use the attacker
models they deﬁned for the formal analysis of CPS.
A ﬁrst step in the direction of the formal analysis of a
water treatment plant has been performed in [30]. A sim-
ple scenario of a subprocess of a water treatment plant has
been deﬁned. Our system model considers all the processes
involved in SWaT and diﬀerent attacker proﬁles.
In [1], the authors performed a security analysis of a water
treatment testbed. They do not apply any formal analysis
tool and a practical assessment is reported. They report a
table with a number of attacks on the physical process. With
our formal analysis we are able to detect all of the attacks
