c5: Visually similar pages (after removing images)
This feature is similar to c4, but accounts for PBNs that include a
unique image for every new “blog entry”.
c6: Similar DOM structure
This feature also leverages the fact that many PBNs make use of
CMSes. In contrast to c4 and c5, which exploit the perceptual infor-
mation of different web pages, this feature looks at the similarity
of how the different HTML elements are structured. In addition
to the visual similarity, it also makes it more difficult for PBN
operators to evade, since they can not simply alter CSS properties
but really have to alter the way they compose web pages.
c7: Cross-domain link URL length
Upon purchasing a PBN package, customers are asked to provide
a link to the domain that needs to be promoted. Customers often
provide a link to the home page. As such, PBN sites are more
likely to have cross-domain links to URLs with an empty path.
c8: Cross-domain links in DOM siblings
This feature was included to improve distinguishing PBN sites
with sites that suffer from comment abuse. Sites whose comment
mechanism is abused to create many new links may have certain
features that resemble PBN sites. Something that distinguishes
them is that most of the links are in DOM siblings, as these are
all comments at the end of the document.
c9: Links to domains outside of Alexa 1M
This feature is similar to c2, but only takes into consideration the
number of domains that are not present in the list of 1 million most
popular sites according to Alexa, i.e. presumably PBN customers.
c10: Unique domains linked to
PBN sites have to link to their customers to boost their SEO score.
Consequently, the unique number of domains that a PBN site
links to is significantly higher compared to non-PBN sites.
c11: URL length, sorted by number of cross-domain links
Many CMSes provide a functionality where they group together
posts within a certain category, or posts that were made in a
certain month. For the displayed post entries, a brief summary
of the beginning of the post is shown. These aggregation pages
have typically a short endpoint, combined with a large number of
cross-domain links. Evasion of this feature is feasible, and require
PBN operators to disable this aggregation function. On the other
hand, this would make all pages even more similar.
c12: Links with text-decoration: none
This feature was introduced to distinguish PBNs from other types
of SEO abuse, namely when adversaries are creating pages with
many links that do not appear as such, i.e. the default under-
lining of links has been disabled by setting the CSS property
text-decoration to the value none.
c13: Links with rel=nofollow
Overall, PBNs have relatively little links with the rel=nofollow
attribute, as they intend to promote their linked customers. Addi-
tionally, other types of SEO abuse, such as comment abuse have a
very high number of links with this attribute.
c14: Unique words in the document
As we showed in Section 5.1, PBN sites have a different distribution
of the number of words used per web page. This feature captures
the median, average, minimum and maximum number of words
found on web pages of a single website.
c15: Number of web pages
As PBN operators typically create a new blog post entry for each
customer they link to, the number of unique web pages found on
a single PBN site can be considerably high. Circumventing this
feature would require PBN sites to either create many more sites,
or remove old blog entries (which would stop the SEO boosting);
both options are unfavorable.
c16: Number of words near links
For each link that is added, PBN operators add some text that is
related to keywords provided by the customer. As such, links are
typically found in the middle of a paragraph with PBNs.
c17: Links that are close to each other
Similar to c8, this feature was added to distinguish between dif-
ferent types of SEO abuse, in this case, link stuffing and comment
abuse, where links are oftentimes placed very close to each other.
c18: Alexa rank of the domain
This feature captures the popularity of PBN domain names.
For each website, we extract features from up to 200 pages. For
the set of 52,777 sites from the guided search, we visit at total
of 5,845,048 pages with a headless browser (Chromium) over the
course of one month (September 2017) by leveraging a distributed
setup of 15 VMs, each provided with 4 vCPUs and 4GB RAM.
4.3.2 Classifier Implementation. As a ground truth, we leverage
the websites found after the first iteration of our three-phased
guided search. By manually labeling these, we found 252 PBN sites
and 775 non-PBN sites. We combine this list with 50 PBN sites
that linked to one of our sites, as part of the exploratory analysis
(the PBN sites are sampled to prevent an over-representation of a
single provider), and a sample of 200 randomly selected non-PBN
sites to ensure a representable ratio. As our dataset is sparse and
contains outliers, we opt for Random Forest, which benefits from the
strength of ensemble learning and is robust against overfitting. To
evaluate our model, we use 10-fold cross-validation on the labeled
dataset which reports an accuracy of 91% and an area under the
ROC curve of 93.8%. However, as the dataset is imbalanced and
we aim to label PBN websites (the minority class) precision and
recall are more important evaluation metrics; these are 87.7% and
73.8% respectively. In the next section, we leverage the output of
the content-based classifier to construct linking-based features,
which are then used to construct another classifier, which improves
precision and recall to more than 98%.
In table 2, we ranked the importance of the top 5 features accord-
ing to their average impurity decrease. This metric calculates how
much each feature decreases the weighted impurity of the trees. In
general, cross-domain links features impacted the accuracy of our
classifier more than the features that are based on the content of a
website such as c14, c15 and c18.
4.4 Linking-based classifier (step 2)
In the second phase of our multi-step classifier, we construct a graph
where the nodes are the sites that need to be classified (in this case
52,777 sites obtained from the second iteration of our three-phase
guided search), complemented with a latent class potential customer.
Instances of this latent class are websites that are being linked to by

likely PBN sites (as determined by our content-based graph). Note
that because our content-based classifier is not perfect and because
PBN sites also link to unrelated sites, instances of this latent class
are websites that have a larger likelihood of being a PBN customer.
4.4.1 Linking-based features. We extract five features from this
graph and leverage these to build a second classifier. The features
are mainly related to the linking behavior of PBN sites to their cus-
tomers, i.e. the ratio of links pointing to PBN customers compared
to non-customers links is significantly higher for PBN sites.
l1: non-customers that are linked to
In our algorithm, websites are marked as a customer, i.e. as soon
as a single site that is more likely to be a PBN site (according
to our content-based classifier) links to it, we consider the site a
potential PBN customer. As such, PBN sites will have relatively
few non-customers they link to. To circumvent this, PBN sites
would have to include many links to unrelated websites, a tactic
that we observed on a few PBN sites during our manual analysis.
l2: Average number of non-PBN links to linked domains
This feature captures the average number of non-PBN sites that
link to the same sites as the site for which the feature is being
computed. As PBN sites mainly link to their customers, which in
turn are less likely to receive links from sites unrelated to the PBN
ecosystem, the value for this feature will be significantly lower
for PBN sites than for non-PBN sites.
l3: Linked customers out of Alexa top 1M
As PBN operators can not choose their customers, and customers
tend to be not-widely-known sites, which sometimes fall outside
the Alexa top 1M, PBN sites will typically link to more unpopular,
potential PBN customers than non-PBN sites. As these customer
sites fall outside of the Alexa top 1M, they are less likely to receive
links from sites outside of the backlink ecosystem. Although it
has been shown that the Alexa list can be manipulated [11, 21],
we consider it unlikely that PBN operators were aware of this at
the time of our data collection. Alternatively, the Tranco list [11],
which is more resilient to manipulation, could be used instead.
l4: Number of customers linked to
Obviously, PBN sites will link to significantly more potential PBN
customers. Similar to l3, this feature is highly impractical, as the
links to the customers need to remain in order to keep their SEO
score boosted. The only alternative would be that PBN operators
create significantly more PBN sites, which comes at a high cost.
l5: Average number of PBN links to linked domains
This feature is similar to l2, but instead focuses on other PBN sites
that link to the same websites. The rationale of this feature is that
a PBN site links to PBN customers, which in turn receive a lot of
incoming links from other PBN sites. This feature is hard to evade
because PBN customers require multiple incoming links in order
to sufficiently boost their SEO score.
We use the manually labeled set of 1,277 sites (302 PBN, 975
non-PBN) to train a Random Forest classifier. Using 10-fold cross-
validation for evaluation, we find precision and recall as 98.5% and
98.4% respectively, showing a significant improvement over just
using the content-based classifier. By applying our model to the
52,777 sites collected from the guided search, our classifier marked
3,552 (6.73%) websites as a PBN site. As a sanity check, we manually
inspected 10% of classified websites and found that all non-PBN
sites were classified correctly. For the PBN sites, we found 6 (1.71%)
misclassified instances. These were either legitimate websites that
were themselves abused (e.g. through the commenting system), or
strongly resemble the characteristics of a PBN site.
4.5 Limitations
Although our approach allows us to accurately discover new PBN
sites without many false positive results, there are a few limitations
that are inherent to our approach. First, our guided search requires
an initial set of PBN sites. In our analysis we obtained these by
purchasing backlinks from a variety of services for a total of $427
USD. Second, as a direct result of our guided search, new PBN
services can only be detected when they provided backlinks for
customers that also purchased the services of PBN providers that
are being considered in the current iteration. As such, under the
assumption that a customer of a high-end backlink provider is
unlikely to have purchased services of a low-end provider, it is
only possible to discover PBN services that are in a similar price
range as the ones from the initial set. Finally, as a more general
limitation of the ecosystem, it is prohibitively difficult to train a
classifier that solely based on isolated features of a website is able to
determine whether a site is associated with a private blog network.
Consequently, we required a second step of our machine learning
method that considered the features related to the linking behavior
of a large number of sites. As such, our approach only allows to
discover new PBN sites with only limited control on which ones will
be detected. Nevertheless, as our approach can be applied iteratively,
each iteration will yield a new set of PBN sites (which can then
serve as the seed for the next iteration).
5 CHARACTERISTICS OF PBN ECOSYSTEM
Leveraging the 3,552 PBN sites we detected in the large-scale ex-
periment by using our classifier, we present an in-depth analysis
of the characteristics of these sites as well as information on the
customers they serve.
5.1 PBN sites
5.1.1 Outgoing links. To analyze how links from PBN sites to their
customers are created, we compute the total number of unique do-
mains that are linked to by PBN and non-PBN sites. The cumulative
distribution of this information, which is shown in Figure 5, clearly
shows that PBN sites link to significantly more unique domains
(median: 112) compared to non-PBN sites (median: 21).
To further evaluate how links are created, we performed an ad-
ditional experiment: for a period of 43 days, we visited a subset of
Figure 5: Cumulative distribution of unique number of do-
mains linked to by PBN and non-PBN sites.
Figure 6: Average word count for PBN sites and websites un-
related to the ecosystem.
PBN sites on a daily basis and collected all outgoing links. We con-
sider the domains that were encountered during the first five days
as a baseline, and after this phase, every previously unseen domain
is considered a new link. We found that the median number of links
created per day over a 38 day period was 0.49, i.e. approximately
one link every two days.
5.1.2 PBN site content. If links to PBN customers would be posted
without an accompanying text or description, the PBN sites could
be easily detected as such. Consequently, PBN sites typically create
a blog post for each link that is created. Depending on the quality
of the PBN, the content of the blog posts are either generated
automatically by so-called text spinners, or are written manually
by a content provider. An example of a PBN site with blog posts
targeting health-related topics is healthy-ch.org, a screenshot of
this website is shown in Figure 9 in the Appendix.
According to many online guides and tutorials on how to im-
prove the SEO score of a website, the length of the posted article
has a significant impact on the ranking. While there is no consensus
on what is the ideal length of a page, most guides advise a length
ranging from 500 to 1,000 or even 2,000 words. Interestingly, when
analyzing the average word count across websites, as shown in
Figure 6, PBN sites contain significantly more text (median: 833)
than websites that we considered not to be PBN sites (median: 395).
5.1.3 Domain name registration. In order to analyze how back-
link providers manage their domain names, we obtained historical
WHOIS information on each of them through the SecurityTrails
API1. As a comparable baseline, we also obtained historical WHOIS
data from an equally sized set of websites that were classified as
non-PBN. For each domain, we calculated the age based on the
creation date of the domain since its last owner. Figure 7 shows the
cumulative distribution for both PBN and non-PBN sites. From this
