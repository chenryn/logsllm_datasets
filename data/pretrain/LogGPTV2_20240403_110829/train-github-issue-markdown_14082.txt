Seen on `rustc 0.12.0-pre-nightly (4d4eb1023 2014-08-02 23:36:09 +0000)`
When compiling my irc message parsing library rustc uses as much CPU and
memory as it can before crashing due to either an out of memory exception or
an "illegal instruction" (stack overflow?).
The weird thing about this is that a single change didn't introduce the bug.
As I worked on it, compile times got slower and slower until my machine could
no longer even build the project.
Uninterestingly, I'm not using macros or any other rust features that might
have explosive properties.
