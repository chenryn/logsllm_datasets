```

**Summary:**
The E2E test `Deployment should label adopted RSs and pods` failed because the pods `nginx-controller-cceta` and `nginx-controller-h8inh` did not transition to the `Running` state within the expected 5-minute timeout. The logs indicate that the pods remained in the `Pending` phase, suggesting an issue with the pod scheduling or resource allocation. Further investigation is required to identify the root cause and resolve the issue.
