## Basic System Components
- **Basic system**
- **Anti-Passback system**

## Physical Credential Technologies
- **Magnetic Strip Card**
- **Wiegand Card**
- **Proximity Card**
- **Barium Ferrite Card**
- **Concealed Barcode Card**
- **Smart Cards**

### Concealed Barcode
- As simple as it sounds, the barcode is hidden behind an IR-transparent material (similar to a remote control).
- **Just embarrassing.**

### Magnetic Stripe
- Typically has 3 tracks.
- **High Coercivity:** 4,000 Oersted
- **Low Coercivity:** 300 Oersted
- Cards are read by an exposed read head in the reader.
- "High security" cards can simply offset the track.

### Clock & Data Protocol
- Requires 3 wires: Clock, Data, and Ground.
- Standard output from a magnetic stripe reader.

### Barium Ferrite
- Uses an insertion reader.
- The card contains discrete magnetic domains.
- Typically encoded in "fridge magnet" type material.
- This was the original "Card Key."

### Wiegand Card
- Special alloy wire is processed to create two distinct magnetic regions in the same piece of wire when passed over a magnetic field.
- The wire is embedded in the card in a specific order to create an individual code.
- Each Wiegand pulse is translated to a digital 0 or 1 depending on the wire location.

### Wiegand Effect
- When Wiegand wires pass a magnet, they store the energy.
- If the wire passes an opposite polarity magnet, it releases the energy.
- A coil placed near the wire can convert this energy into an electronic pulse.

### Wiegand Electrical Protocol
- Requires 3 wires: Binary 1, Binary 0, and Ground.

### Wiegand Format
- 0s and 1s are divided into bit fields known as Wiegand format.
- 26-bit is a "universal format."
- Most access card manufacturers have proprietary formats which they sell at additional cost.

## Proximity
- **Passive:** The reader emits an RF field that powers the card.
- The card sends its data back to the reader, where it is read by the host system.
- **Active:** The card emits a field to the reader.

### Proximity and RFID
- **Proximity cards** are magnetically coupled, with a short read range. They transmit response by shorting out their own receive coil, causing minute power drops in the reader's transmit coil.
- **RFID cards** can have longer read ranges, energized by a signal on frequency X and transmitting response on a fraction of frequency Â½ X.

### Proximity ID Cards
- Transmit a single bitstream, typically 26 bits.
- "High security" versions can be 40 bits, with rumors of up to 84-bit versions.
- Security is often achieved by manufacturers restricting "sitecodes."
- The world generally uses 26 bits.

### Contactless Smart Card
- The way to go.
- Authentication between reader and card.
- Strong cryptographic methods.

## Biometrics
- **Retina Scan**
- **Iris Scan**
- **Venial Hand/Finger Map**
- **Hand Geometry**
- **Fingerprint**

### Fingerprint
- **Image capture and feature comparison**
- Two technologies: Optical and Capacitive (semiconductor)
- Easily defeated with gummy bears, licked photocopies, silicone fingertips, etc.

### Fingerprint Feature Analysis
- Analyzes features for authentication.

### Hand Geometry
- Images the hand, using pegs to center it.
- A 45-degree mirror allows for a 3D check.

### Venial Hand Scan
- Image capture using an infrared camera.

### Iris Scan
- Captures an image of the iris.
- Potential for walk-by capture.
- All biometric devices on the market today are essentially image capture devices.

### Retina Scan
- More secure, as it is hard to "steal" the credential.
- Hard to use, requiring training and practice.
- The manufacturer went bankrupt.

### Example of How It Works
1. User enters code on the reader.
2. A visual dot and target are displayed in the eyepiece.
3. User looks into the eyepiece and moves their head to align the dot onto the target.
4. Once aligned, the user presses the scan button.
5. HOLD STILL!!!

### Not as Easy as It Sounds
- No two reads will ever be identical.
- There must be some leeway allowed.

### Retina Scan Process
- The reader scans a circle of the retina.
- It spots the dark bits (veins) and notes their location on the circle.
- The user credential is 360 bits long.

### Coolness Factor
- High, due to the alignment process and the fudge factor.
- ID generally ends up as a hash.

### Statistical Considerations
- **False Acceptance Rate (FAR):** Rate at which someone other than the actual person is falsely recognized.
- **False Rejection Rate (FRR):** Rate at which the actual person is not recognized accurately.
- All these technologies are coupled with a user ID.

### Credential Revocation
- **Fingerprint/Hand Revocation Device**
- **Retina/Iris Revocation Device**

### The Catch
- Backward compatibility in the security industry is a bad thing.

### Wiegand
- Initially considered top-notch, all access control manufacturers ensured their systems could interface with Wiegand-enabled readers.
- Every reader, from the super-secure biometric retina scanner to the "crappy" concealed barcode, uses the Wiegand electrical and data protocols to communicate with the access control system.

### EEEK!
- **Plain Text!**
- Easily intercepted and replayed.
- Includes output from biometric readers and strong crypto contactless smart card readers.

### The Goal
- Record Wiegand IDs.
- Replay Wiegand IDs.
- Small, easily installable, and cheap (if possible).

### Challenges
- Unit control (send replay command) without visible wires.
- Card validation (don't record bad cards).
- Data extraction (read out card IDs) without visible wires.

### Connection
- **Gecko** uses "Command Cards" to control functions, the "Access Allowed" LED control line to validate cards, and the LED to download data.

### Demo
- **Standard Demo Disclaimer:** This is a demo, so nothing will work. However, if it does, I'm totally prepared to take all the credit for it!

### Development Versions
- **Version 1:** Proof of concept with basic features: Record, Replay, Disable, Enable.
- **Version 2:** Stores multiple IDs to EEPROM/flash, checks card validity via the reader LED, downloads data via the LED, and loads data via command cards.
- **Version 3:** Adds Bluetooth control interface, ideal for biometric devices.
- **Version 4:** Adds GSM interface for remote monitoring of facility access.
