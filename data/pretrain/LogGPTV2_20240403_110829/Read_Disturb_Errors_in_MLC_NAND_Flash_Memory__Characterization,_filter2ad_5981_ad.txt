cells are all turned on, allowing values from the wordline being
read to pass through successfully.
Let us explore what happens if we relax Vpass to 4.6V,
as shown in Fig. 9b. The ﬁrst two bitlines (BL1 and BL2) in
Fig. 9a are unaffected, since all of the threshold voltages on
the transistors of their unread cells are less than 4.6V, and so
these transistors on BL1 and BL2 still turn on (as they should).
However, the third bitline (BL3) exhibits an error. The transistor
for the bottom cell in BL3 is now turned off, since Vpass is
lower than its threshold voltage. In this case, a read error is
introduced: the cell in the wordline being read was turned on,
yet our incorrectly turned off bottom cell prevents the value
from passing through properly. If we examine the fourth bitline
(BL4), the top cell is also turned off now due to the lower value
of Vpass. This case, however, does not produce an error, since
the cell being read would have been turned off anyways (as
its Vth is greater than Vref ). As a result of our relaxed Vpass,
instead of reading the correct value 0010, we now read 0000.
Note that this single-bit error may still be correctable by ECC.
To identify the extent to which relaxing Vpass affects the
raw bit error rate, we experimentally sweep over Vpass, reading
the data after a range of different retention ages, as shown in
Fig. 10. First, we observe that across all of our studied retention
ages, Vpass can be lowered to some degree without inducing
any read errors. For greater relaxations, though, the error rate
increases as more unread cells are incorrectly turned off during
read operations. We also note that, for a given Vpass value, the
additional read error rate is lower if the read is performed a
longer time after the data is programmed into the ﬂash (i.e.,
if the retention age is longer). This is because of the retention
loss effect, where cells slowly leak charge and thus have lower
threshold voltage values over time. Naturally, as the threshold
voltage of every cell decreases, a relaxed Vpass becomes more
likely to correctly turn on the unread cells.
We now quantify the potential reduction in RBER when
a relaxed Vpass is used to reduce the effects of read disturb.
When performing this characterization, we must work around
the current ﬂash device limitation that Vpass cannot be altered
by the controller. We overcome this limitation by using the
read-retry mechanism to emulate a reduced Vpass to a single
wordline. For these experiments, after we program pseudo-
random data to the cells, we set the read reference voltage to the
relaxed Vpass value. We then repeatedly read the LSB page of
our selected wordline for N times, where N is the number
of neighboring wordline reads we want to emulate (which,

in practice, would apply our relaxed Vpass to this selected
wordline). We then measure the RBER for both the LSB and
MSB pages of our selected wordline by applying the default
values of read reference voltages (Va, Vb, and Vc) to it.
Fig. 11 shows the change in RBER as a function of the
number of read operations, for selected relaxations of Vpass.
Note that the x-axis uses a log scale. For a ﬁxed number of
reads, even a small decrease in the Vpass value can yield a
signiﬁcant decrease in RBER. As an example, at 100K reads,
lowering Vpass by 2% can reduce the RBER by as much
as 50%. Conversely, for a ﬁxed RBER, a decrease in Vpass
exponentially increases the number of tolerable read disturbs.
This is also shown in Table 1, which lists the increased ratio
of read disturb errors a ﬂash device can tolerate in its lifetime
(while RBER ≤ 1.0×10–3 [6, 7]) with a lowered Vpass. This
result is consistent with our model in Sec. 3.4, where we ﬁnd a
super-linear relationship between (Vpass−Vth) and the induced
tunneling effect (which affects read disturbs). We conclude that
reducing Vpass per block can greatly reduce the RBER due to
read disturb.

3.7. Error Correction with Reduced Pass-Through
Voltage
So far, we have examined how read disturb count and pass-
through voltage affect the raw bit error rate. While we have
shown in Sec. 3.6 that Vpass can be lowered to some degree
without introducing new raw bit errors, we would ideally like
to further decrease Vpass to lower the read disturb impact more.
This can enable ﬂash devices to tolerate many more reads, as
we demonstrated in Fig. 11.
Modern ﬂash memory devices experience a limited number
of raw bit errors, which come from a number of sources:
erase errors, program errors, errors caused by program in-
terference from neighboring cells, retention errors, and read
disturb errors [2,7,24]. As ﬂash memories guarantee a minimum
level of error-free non-volatility, modern devices include error
correcting codes (ECC) that are used to ﬁx raw bit errors [21].
Depending on the number of ECC bits used, an ECC mecha-
nism can provide a certain error correction capability (i.e., the
total number of bit errors it can correct for a single read). If the
number of bit errors in a read ﬂash page is below this capability,
ECC delivers error-free data. However, if the number of errors
exceeds the ECC capability, the correction mechanism cannot
successfully correct the data in the read page. As a result, the
amount of ECC protection must cover the total number of raw
bit errors expected in the device. ECC capability is practically
limited, as a greater capability requires additional ECC bits
(and therefore greater storage, power consumption, and latency
overhead [6, 7]) per ﬂash page.
In this subsection, our goal is to identify how many addi-
tional raw bit errors the current level of ECC provisioning in
ﬂash chips can sustain. With room to tolerate additional raw bit
errors, we can further decrease Vpass without fear of delivering
incorrect data. A typical ﬂash device is considered to be error-
free if it guarantees an uncorrectable bit error rate of less than
10–15, which corresponds to traditional data storage reliability
requirements [16,21]. For an ECC mechanism that can correct
40 bits of errors for every 1K bytes, the acceptable raw bit error
rate to meet the reliability requirements is 10–3 [6, 7].
Fig. 12 shows how the expected RBER changes over a
21-day period for our tested ﬂash chip without read disturb,
using a block with 8,000 P/E cycles of wear. Unsurprisingly,
as retention age increases, retention errors increase, driving up
the RBER [2, 4, 24]. However, when the retention age is low,
the retention error rate is also low, as is the overall raw bit error
rate, resulting in signiﬁcant unused ECC correction capability.

age, for a ﬂash block with 8K P/E cycles of wear.
Based on our analysis in Sec. 3.6, we can ﬁll
in the
unused ECC correction capability with read errors introduced
by relaxing Vpass, which would allow the ﬂash memory to
tolerate more read disturbs. As we illustrate in Fig. 12, an
RBER margin (20% of the total ECC correction capability) is
reserved to account for the variation in the distribution of errors
and other potential errors (e.g., program and erase errors). For
each retention age, we record the maximum percentage of safe
Vpass reduction (i.e., the lowest value of Vpass at which all read
errors can still be corrected by ECC) compared to the default
pass-through voltage (Vpass = 512). This percentage is listed on
the top of Fig. 12. As we can see, by exploiting the previously-
unused ECC correction capability, Vpass can be safely reduced
by as much as 4% when the retention age is low (less than 4
days). Since the amount of previously-unused ECC correction

capability decreases over retention age, Vpass must be increased
for reads to remain correctable.
Our key insight from this study is that a lowered Vpass
can reduce the effects of read disturb, and that the read errors
induced from lowering Vpass can be tolerated by the built-in
error correction mechanism within modern ﬂash controllers.
Using this insight, in Sec. 4, we design a mechanism that can
dynamically tune the Vpass value, based on the characteristics
of each ﬂash block and the age of the data stored within it.
3.8. Summary of Key Characterization Results
From our characterization, we make the following major
conclusions: (1) The magnitude of threshold voltage shifts due
to read disturb increases for larger values of (Vpass − Vth);
hence, minimizing Vpass can greatly reduce such threshold
voltage shifts; (2) Blocks with greater wear (i.e., more P/E
cycles) experience larger threshold voltage shifts due to read
disturb; (3) While reducing Vpass can reduce the raw bit errors
that occur as a result of read disturb, it can introduce other
errors that affect reliability; (4) The over-provisioned correction
capability of ECC can allow us to reliably decrease Vpass on
a per-block basis, as long as the decreases are dynamically
adjusted as the age of the data grows to tolerate increasing
retention errors.
4. Mitigation: Pass-Through Voltage Tuning
In Sec. 3, we made a number of new observations about
the read disturb phenomenon. We now propose Vpass Tuning,
a new technique that exploits those observations to mitigate
NAND ﬂash read disturb errors, by tuning the pass-through
voltage (Vpass) for each ﬂash block. The key idea is to reduce
the number of read disturb errors by shrinking (Vpass− Vth) as
much as possible, where Vth is the value stored within a ﬂash
cell. Our mechanism trades off read disturb errors for the read
errors that are introduced when lowering Vpass, but these read
errors can be corrected using the unused portion of the ECC
correction capability.
4.1. Motivation
NAND ﬂash memory typically uses ECC to correct a certain
number of raw bit errors within each page, as we discussed in
Sec. 3.7. As long as the total number of errors does not exceed
the ECC correction capability, the errors can be corrected and
the data can be successfully read. When the retention age of the
data is low, we ﬁnd that the retention error rate (and therefore
the overall raw bit error rate) is much lower than the rate at
high retention ages (see Fig. 12), resulting in signiﬁcant unused
ECC correction capability.

4.2. Mechanism Overview
We reduce the ﬂash read disturb errors by relaxing Vpass
when the block’s retention age is low, thus minimizing the
impact of read disturb. Recall from Sec. 3 that reducing Vpass
has two major effects: (1) a read operation may fail if Vpass
is lower than the Vth of any cell on the bitline; (2) reducing
Vpass can signiﬁcantly decrease the read disturb effect for each
read operation. If we aggressively lower Vpass when a block
has a low retention age (which is hopefully possible without
causing uncorrectable read errors due to the large unused ECC
