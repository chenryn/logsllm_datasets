User: I'm automating a configuration process for an embedded board.  To enter the setup screen I need to send "Ctrl-C" command.
This is NOT to interrupt a process I'm running locally, KeyboardInterrupt will not work.  I need to send a value that will be interpreted by the bootloader as Ctrl-C.
What is the value I need to send?
Thank you
Assistant: IIRC, Ctrl-C is etx.  Thus send \x03.
