When using the customization feature on the [Bootstrap website](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/) to compile a custom version of Bootstrap, I noticed that the generated `bootstrap.css` file contains CSS selectors in an incorrect order. This issue came to light when I was troubleshooting why the `DIV` with the class `modal-backdrop` was appearing as black instead of transparent.

In CSS, the order of selectors is crucial, as it can affect how styles are applied. Here's a comparison of the selector order in the custom and standard Bootstrap versions:

**Custom:**
- `.modal-backdrop.in` (line 5094)
- `.fade.in` (line 5894)

**Standard (from [Bootstrap documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals)):**
- `.modal-backdrop.in` (line 5665)
- `.fade.in` (line 2366)

The only setting I modified in the custom version was setting `@grid-float-breakpoint` to 920px. Despite this minor change, the discrepancy in the order of the selectors caused the `modal-backdrop` to display incorrectly.
