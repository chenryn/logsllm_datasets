Compiling a custom Bootstrap via the http://getbootstrap.com/customize/
website feature generates boostrap.css with selectors in an incorrect order.
I found this out when trying to figure out why the DIV modal-backdrop was
appearing black instead of transparent.  
As we know.. the order matters!  
Custom*:  
.modal-backdrop.in line:5094  
.fade.in line:5894  
http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals  
.modal-backdrop.in line:5665  
.fade.in line:2366  
*the only setting I changed for 'custom' was setting @grid-float-breakpoint to 920px
