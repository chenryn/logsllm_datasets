### Issue Type: Bug Report

#### Ansible Version: 1.5
#### Environment: CentOS 6.5
#### Summary: Included Templates in Jinja2 Lose Variable Context

#### Steps to Reproduce:
1. In the main template file, use the following code snippet:
   ```jinja2
   {% for group in group_names %}
       {% include "debug_include.j2" with context %}
   {% endfor %}
   ```

2. In the included template `debug_include.j2`, use the following code:
   ```jinja2
   This is the included Template. The current group is {{ group }}
   ```

3. According to the documentation, included templates should have the same variable context as the main template. Therefore, I expect to see output like:
   ```
   This is the included Template. The current group is mailserver
   ```

#### Expected Results:
The expected output should be:
```
This is the included Template. The current group is mailserver
```

#### Actual Results:
When executing the playbook, I receive the following error:
```
TASK: [common-linux | dump all variables]
*************************************
fatal: [ltesthost] => {'msg': "One or more undefined variables: 'group' is undefined", 'failed': True}
fatal: [testhost] => {'msg': "One or more undefined variables: 'group' is undefined", 'failed': True}
FATAL: all hosts have already failed -- aborting
```

This indicates that the variable `group` is not available in the included template, despite using `with context`.
