##### Issue Type: Bug Report
##### Ansible Version: 1.5
##### Environment: CentOS 6.5
##### Summary: includes in templates loose their variable context
##### Steps To Reproduce:
In one template file i have this code snippet:  
{% for group in group_names %}  
{% include "debug_include.j2" with context %}  
{% endfor %}
In the included template 'debug_include.j2' i have this code:  
This is the included Template. The current group is {{group}}
The documentation claims that included templates have the same variable
context as the main file.  
So i would expect to see something like:  
This is the included Template. The current group is mailserver
##### Expected Results:
I would expect to see something like:  
This is the included Template. The current group is mailserver
##### Actual Results:

undefined", 'failed': True}  
fatal: [testhost] => {'msg': "One or more undefined variables: 'group' is
