User: For the very same REST route, e.g. /message, can I configure routing to execute different handlers based on the value of the Content-Type header?
Assistant: No. Tornado's routing only considers the hostname and path. You'll have to route this path to a single RequestHandler and then inspect the Content-Type inside that handler.
