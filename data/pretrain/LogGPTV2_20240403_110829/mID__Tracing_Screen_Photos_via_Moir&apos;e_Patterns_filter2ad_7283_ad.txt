No other image processing techniques, e.g., ﬁlters, are used
during the experiments since (1) not all smartphones provide
these techniques, and (2) they are not activated by default.
The detailed parameters of the cameras are shown in Tab. 2.
Note that at the time of writing, we ﬁnd no Moiré pattern ﬁlter
functions available on smartphones on the current market.
Ambient Light. We conduct most experiments under the
artiﬁcial lights produced by LEDs (∼ 200 lm), as it is the most
likely attack environment in practice. In addition, we conduct
experiments under the case of (1) natural lights (∼ 20 lm),
and (2) no additional lights except for those from the display
screen ( 84 cm or
< 56 cm, mID decoding accuracy drops due to that the gen-
erated Moiré patterns become invisible to both human eyes
and camera sensors. Overall, mID decoding can achieve an
average BER of 0.4% and an average NER of 2.7% under the
distance range of (60 cm,80 cm). In addition, according to the
calculation shown in Appendix 11.1, to capture a 24" display
screen completely, the photograph distance D is usually larger
than 60 cm for various smartphones. Therefore, we believe
that mID is basically sufﬁcient to cover the possible attack
distances adopted by adversaries.
6.3.6 Impact of Photograph Angles
In addition to the photograph distance, we investigate the
impact of shooting angles from three degrees-of-freedom, i.e.,
roll, pitch, and yaw, as shown in Fig. 11. The ﬁrst degree-
of-freedom roll rotates the image captured by the camera
in the x-y plane, and we can reduce its impact by image
rotation. The second and third degrees-of-freedom pitch and
yaw mainly cause vertical and horizontal deformation in the
captured image respectively. In real attacks, the former may
have little impact since we employ the transverse encoding,
which means pixels of the same column are supposed to be
identical and thus vertical deformation may not affect the
information representation. Besides, both the vertical and
horizontal deformation can be addressed with rectiﬁcation
techniques [8, 53]. Therefore, we mainly evaluate the impact
of the last degree-of-freedom, i.e., yaw, in this paper since it
is most relevant to mID scheme.
During the experiments, we take the symmetry axis of the
smartphone screen as the center axis and rotate the yaw an-
gle with a step of 2◦. We set the shooting distance to default
throughout the experiments and the smartphone is tangent to
the arc consisted by its motion locus. Without loss of general-
ity, we start from the central point where the smartphone is
paralleled with the display screen, i.e., 0◦, and increase the an-
gle of inclination in both clockwise (+) and anticlockwise (-)
directions. For each angle, we collect 50 photos and perform
mID decoding.
From the results shown in Fig. 12(f), we can observe that
mID achieves a relatively low BER and NER with a pho-
tograph angle less than 20◦. When the inclination angle is
further increased, the distortion of Moiré stripes becomes non-
negligible and difﬁcult to be corrected, and thus may affect
the performance of mID extraction and decoding. However,
we argue that with an inclination angle larger than 20◦, the
image content is heavily distorted as well, which may also
deviate from the goal of the adversaries. Overall, mID is able
to achieve an average BER of 0.5% and an average NER of
3.6% with a photograph angle within (−20◦,20◦).
7 Preliminary User Study
We measure whether users will notice the presence of mID
and how users cope with mID-related Moiré patterns in the
screen photos by conducting a user study among 34 volun-
teers. Most of them are graduate students aged 20-30 years
old. We followed the local regulations to protect the rights
of human participants despite the absence of Institutional
Review Board (IRB).
To study whether users can recognize the presence of mID,
we conduct the following test: on an LCD monitor in an
ofﬁce room, we display a PDF document using Abode Reader,
which is an IELTS essay about news and we embed mID in
both sides of the document body. The participants are required
to sit in front of the monitor and provided 5 minutes to read
the essay. After reading, we conduct a questionnaire survey
