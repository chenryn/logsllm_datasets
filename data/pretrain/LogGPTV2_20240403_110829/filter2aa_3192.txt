What is smbexec? 
What does it do? 
Why should I care? 
•
There’s nothing 0 day here! BOO!  
•
Yes, but automation is awesome! 
•
You can use this tool immediately 
•
It will make post-exploitation much easier 
What’s this all about?

•
Bash script, yes, a bash script… 
•
1 week of work, consuming a 
years worth of Mountain Dew 
•
Power of the tool lies in smbclient & 
winexe 
•
smbclient to get/put files 
•
winexe to execute

•
Standard msf payloads with psexec module 
kept getting popped by AV 
•
Custom exes also popped because AV 
trigger is on injection (service protection) 
•
Damn you trend micro, but thanks for the 
motivation

Upload and execute your payload 
Why write smbexec?

I want my shells and I want them now! 
•
Creates an obfuscated payload that will 
bypass most commercial AV 
•
Creates a Metasploit rc file and launches a 
Metasploit listener to make things “easy.” 
What have you done for me lately?

What? You can get all this great stuff with winexe 
and native windows commands? 
Going Native

•
winexe is similar to sysinternals psexec and 
the --system flag is awesome 
•
No “payload” necessary 
•
Looks like normal Windows traffic to OPSEC.

you

The caveats…there’s always 
something 
You need a credential with admin rights for the 
system (local or domain) 
•
administrator:password can usually get you 
started in 9 out of 10 corporate networks 
•
NBNS spoofing 
•
Of course there’s always MS08-067 ;-)

•
winexe creates a service, could be stopped or 
become a red flag 
•
Sometimes AV doesn't like wce 
•
wce included with smbexec has been obfuscated 
with the approval of the original developer 
•
Authentication over port 139 or 445 is required 
•

leaves a trace"
