To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:

1. Execute the `dir` command.
2. Select a line that contains "OpenConsoleFullPDB.pdb".
3. Resize the window so that the selected line completely fills the width of the buffer, with no spaces on the right.
4. Run the `dir` command again. The selected line should now exactly fill one line.
5. Increase the width of the window. Observe that the line below the selected line has wrapped up to the previous line.

This behavior is reproducible with both the `dir` and `ls -lA` commands, indicating that it is not specific to WSL/VT.
