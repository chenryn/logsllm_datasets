User:  How to realize hardware resource monitoring and performance optimization on Linux system?
Assistant: The following measures can be taken to monitor hardware resources and optimize performance on a Linux system: 1. Use the top command to view system load conditions, including CPU utilization, memory utilization, and process status. 2. Use the ps command to view the process information running on the system, including process ID, occupied CPU and memory and other information. 3. Use the iftop command or iptraf command to monitor network traffic, which is convenient for checking the network load. 4. Use the vmstat command to view the virtual memory status, including process, memory, disk and CPU information. 5. Collect and analyze system performance data through the sar command. 6. Use the iostat command to view disk I/O performance. 7. Use the mpstat command to view the running status of the multi-core CPU, including information such as the utilization rate and waiting time of each CPU. 8. Use the sysstat toolkit for performance monitoring and data analysis, including sar, iostat, mpstat and other tools. 9. Perform system tuning, including adjusting kernel parameters, upgrading hardware and other measures to improve system performance. 10. Optimize the application, including using cache, using multi-threading, adjusting program logic and other measures to improve application performance.
