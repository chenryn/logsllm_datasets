passwords. MnePerEx explicitly asked users to choose person-
alized sentences that other people are unlikely to choose with an
example “I went to London four and a half years ago”. Among
the 777 participants, there was no sentence or password selected
more than once. We observed that 536 sentences start with “I”
or “my”, suggesting a personalized choice. In comparison, such
sentences appeared only 125 times in MneGenEx. We noted that
not all participants chose personalized sentences. Common sen-
tences such as “to be or not to be, that is the question” still occur in
the dataset. Because they occur with much lower frequencies, we
did not observe any collision in the dataset. With larger datasets,
collisions are bound to occur. As a result, the ˜λ10 value (1.3%)
in sentences selected in MnePerEx was signiﬁcantly smaller than
that from MneGenEx (z = 6.26, p < 0.001), and the compari-
son of the resulted passwords between MneGenEx and MnePerEx
leads to similar results. This indicates that in terms of security,
MnePerEx is signiﬁcantly better than MneGenEx based on the ˜λ1
and ˜λ10 metrics.
Finding 3: Commonly suggested instantiations are worse than
MnePerEx. Seeing results from MneGenEx and MnePerEx, it was
clear to us that the instructions played a critical role in the level
of security. We then tried to evaluate the precise instructions sug-
gested in Bruce Schneier’s two blog posts [31, 32]. We noted that
the instructions in the two posts were slightly different. Our ver-
sion, MneSchEx, was based on the version in [32], which was
the more elaborated one. MneSchEx had several differences from
MnePerEx. First, it gave 4 examples, some of which are popular,
e.g., “Long time ago in a galaxy not far away at all”, others are more
personalized “When I was seven, my sister threw my stuffed rabbit
in the toilet”. Second, in the examples, some words are completely
kept in the resulting passwords. Third, while the instructions said
“Choose your own sentence – something personal”; it did not in-
clude the phrase “other people are unlikely to use”.
The results came back at somewhere in between MneGenEx and
MnePerEx. Among 753 participants, 9 different sentences were
not uniquely chosen, with the most common sentence appearing 3
times and the ˜λ1 was 0.4%. The ˜λ10 of sentence selected was 2.8%.
There was only a single password selected twice. The ˜λ10 from
MneSchEx was signiﬁcantly larger than that from MneGenEx (z =
4.47, p < 0.001), and was signiﬁcantly smaller than MnePerEx

(z = 2.08, p = 0.019). One might notice that if passwords are not
case-sensitive, the frequency of the most common password was
more than the max count of sentences. The four repeated passwords
actually came from 3 variations of the same sentence “the quick
brown fox jumps over the lazy dog”, “the quick brown fox jumped
over the lazy dogs”, and “the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy
dog”.
We also studied the effect of the instructions and examples used
In MneYanEx, the instruc-
in Yan et al. [44, 45] (MneYanEx).
tions for creating passwords was relatively generic. However, “hard
for anyone else to guess” was explicitly mentioned in the exam-
ples. As a result, both the ˜λ1 (0.3%) and ˜λ10 (1.6%) in sentence
choices from MneYanEx was less than those from MneSchEx,
but is more than that from MnePerEx. The difference in ˜λ10 be-
tween MneYanEx and MneGenEx was signiﬁcant (z = 5.91, p <
0.001).
Finding 4: Both personalized sentences and high-quality ex-
amples are needed to achieve better security. Another question
is whether the instructions or the examples have more inﬂuence on
the unpredictability of the chosen sentences and consequently the
generated passwords. This led us to study the two variants MnePer
and MneEx. MnePer asked for personalized sentences in instruc-
tions, but did not provide any example; while MneEx did not ex-
plicitly ask for personalized sentence in the instructions, but pro-
vided a list of personal sentences as examples. For MnePer, the
most popular one was chosen 5 times (˜λ1 = 0.7%), and ˜λ10 was
2.8%. ˜λ10 from MnePer was signiﬁcantly smaller than that from
MneGenEx (z = 4.42, p < 0.001), and was signiﬁcantly larger
than that from MnePerEx (z = 2.11, p = 0.017). For MneEx,
