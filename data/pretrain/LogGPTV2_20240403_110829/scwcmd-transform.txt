### scwcmd transform

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `scwcmd transform` command converts a security policy file, generated using the Security Configuration Wizard (SCW), into a new Group Policy Object (GPO) in Active Directory Domain Services. This transformation does not modify any settings on the server where it is executed. After the transformation, an administrator must link the GPO to the desired Organizational Units (OUs) to deploy the policy to the servers.

**Important Notes:**
- Domain administrator credentials are required to complete the transformation.
- Internet Information Services (IIS) security policy settings cannot be deployed via Group Policy.
- Firewall policies that list approved applications should not be deployed to servers unless the Windows Firewall service started automatically when the server was last booted.

**Syntax:**
```shell
scwcmd transform /p:<policy_file> /g:<gpo_name>
```

**Parameters:**
- **/p:** Specifies the path and filename of the .xml policy file to be applied. This parameter is mandatory.
- **/g:** Specifies the display name of the GPO. This parameter is mandatory.
- **/?**: Displays help information at the command prompt.

**Examples:**
To create a GPO named `FileServerSecurity` from a file named `FileServerPolicy.xml`, use the following command:
```shell
scwcmd transform /p:FileServerPolicy.xml /g:FileServerSecurity
```

This command will transform the specified policy file into a new GPO with the given display name. The GPO can then be linked to the appropriate OUs for deployment.
