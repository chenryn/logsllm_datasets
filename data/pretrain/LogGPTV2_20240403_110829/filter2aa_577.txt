## Multi-touch Interfaces
### Definition
- **Multi-touch:** A technology that allows a user to interact with a computer by using multiple fingers or other objects on a touch-sensitive surface.

### Types of Multi-touch Technologies
- **Electronic:**
  - **Capacitive (e.g., iPhone)**
    - Difficult to build at home due to complexity.
- **Optical:**
  - **Main Idea:** Capture infrared blobs with a camera.

## Optical Multi-touch
### Illumination Techniques
- **Rear Diffused Illumination:**
  - **Example:** Microsoft Surface
  - Infrared light shines out of the screen, illuminating objects in contact with it.
- **Frustrated Total Internal Reflection (FTIR):**
  - **Method:** Shine light into the edges of plexiglass.
  - **Mechanism:** Touching the glass causes it to flex and emit light.
  - **Usage:** This is the method we use.

## Our Big Screen
- **AKA That Thing I Keep Tripping Over**
  - **Method:** FTIR
  - **Dimensions:** 56” diagonal, 16:9 aspect ratio (approximately 48”x30”)
  - **Resolution:** 1280 x 800
  - **Construction:** Plexiglass
  - **Projection Screen:** Laminated vellum
  - **LEDs:** 168 IR LEDs
  - **Camera:** PlayStation Eye

## Architecture
- **Touch Signals over UDP:**
  - **Protocol:** TUIO

## Applications
- **Ongoing Projects:**
  - **Immersive Collaboration (multi-touch caves)**
  - **Educational Software (building tables for schools)**
- **Security Lab Focus:**
  - **Campy Movies Reference:** “It's a UNIX system!”
- **Gaming:**
  - We also use the big screen for gaming.

## DVNE (Dynamic Visualization for Network Environments)
- **Primary Goal:** Build a flashy Hollywood-style computer interface.
- **Secondary Goal:** Develop a useful tool for network monitoring.
- **Network Monitor:**
  - Track TCP streams and identify protocols using signatures.
- **Interface:**
  - **Programming Language:** Python with PyMT multitouch extensions
  - **Protocol:** TUIO
