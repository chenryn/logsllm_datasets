Overview
• Multi-touch interfaces
–
What is multi-touch?
•
This rhetorical question will not be dignified with a 
response.
–
Optical multi-touch methods
• Our big board
–
History, building process
–
Other uses
• The tool: DVNE
–
Architecture
–
Future plans

Multi-touch Methods
• Electronic
–
Capacitive (iPhone)
–
Hard to build at home
• Optical
–
Main idea: capture infrared blobs with a camera
Computer Science / www.isec.utulsa.edu
Optical Multi-touch
• The question: how to illuminate the touches?
• Rear Diffused Illumination
–
Example: Microsoft Surface
–
IR shines out of the screen, illuminating objects

Optical Multi-touch
•
Frustrated Total Internal Reﬂection
–
Shine light into the edges of plexiglass
–
Touching the glass causes it to flex and emit light
–
This is what we use

Our big screen
• AKA That Thing I Keep Tripping Over
–
FTIR method
–
56” diagonal, 16:9 aspect ratio (roughly 48”x30”)
–
1280 x 800
–
Plexiglass construction
–
Laminated vellum
projection screen
–
168 IR LEDs
–
PlayStation Eye camera

Architecture
• Touch signals over UDP
–
TUIO Protocol

What do we DO with it?
• Some ongoing projects
–
Immersive collaboration (multi-touch caves)
–
Educational software (we're building tables for schools)
• But we're a security lab
–
We also like campy movies. (“It's a UNIX system!”)

We also play games ...

DVNE
• Dynamic Visualization for Network Environments
–
Primary goal: to build a flashy Hollywood-style 
computer interface 
–
Secondary goal: build something useful for looking at 
networks
• Network monitor
–
Track TCP streams, identify protocol using signatures
• Interface
–
Python with pymt multitouch extensions
–
