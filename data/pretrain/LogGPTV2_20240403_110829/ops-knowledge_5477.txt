Question: A company needs to implement encryption for its messaging system to ensure privacy and security. The system should prevent an eavesdropper from deducing information about the plaintext when the same message is sent multiple times. Additionally, it should thwart tampering with ciphertexts that would allow unauthorized modification of message contents. Which of the following block cipher modes of operation should the company consider implementing to meet these requirements?
"A": "ECB Mode because it encrypts each block separately, making it difficult for eavesdroppers to deduce information.",
"B": "CBC Mode since it uses an initialization vector and chains ciphertext blocks, which enhances security.",
"C": "OFB Mode because it makes tampering with ciphertexts easy, demonstrating its robustness against unauthorized changes.",
"D": "CTR Mode as it uses a counter and encryption function, resembling the security properties of a one-time pad."
