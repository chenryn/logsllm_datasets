User: I'm using REPL extension for Sublime text 3 for my python projects. Currently when I want to interrupt a running script I have to close to close the REPL window to stop execution and all computations are so far are lost. 
I was wondering if anybody knows how to interrupt an execution and have a short cut or key bindings for that
Assistant: As mentioned above (a long time ago) the key bindings aren't present for Windows. However, one can Mouse Right Click to open a context menu. From here there are menu options for Kill and Restart. You can also open a sub-menu which allows you send those and other signals including SIGINT.
