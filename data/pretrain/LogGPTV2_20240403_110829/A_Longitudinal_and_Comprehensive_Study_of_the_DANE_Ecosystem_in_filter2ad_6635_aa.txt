## Abstract
This paper presents a longitudinal and comprehensive study of the DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) ecosystem in email. DANE allows clients and servers to establish a TLS connection without relying on trusted third parties like Certificate Authorities (CAs) by publishing TLSA records. The integrity and authenticity of these records are ensured by the Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC). However, DANE can only function correctly if each principal in its PKI properly performs its duties: DANE servers must publish consistent TLSA records, and DANE clients must verify these records.

Our study reveals pervasive mismanagement in the DANE ecosystem. For instance, 36% of TLSA records cannot be validated due to missing or incorrect DNSSEC records, and 14.17% are inconsistent with their certificates. Only four email service providers support DANE for both outgoing and incoming emails, but two of them have issues with not checking the Certificate Usage in TLSA records. On the positive side, administrators can leverage open-source MTA and DNS programs to support DANE correctly.

## Introduction
The DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) standard enables clients and servers to establish a TLS connection without relying on trusted third parties like CAs by publishing TLSA records. DANE leverages the Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) to ensure the integrity and authenticity of these records. For DANE to work correctly, each entity in its Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) must perform its duties: DANE servers (e.g., SMTP servers) must publish consistent TLSA records, and DANE clients (e.g., SMTP clients) must verify these records.

DANE is gaining popularity in the email ecosystem to improve transport security between mail servers. However, its security benefits depend on correct deployment. This paper presents a large-scale, longitudinal, and comprehensive measurement study of DANE deployment and management. We collected data for all second-level domains under the .com, .net, .org, .nl, and .se top-level domains (TLDs) over 24 months to analyze server-side deployment and management. For client-side analysis, we investigated 29 popular email service providers and tested four popular MTA and ten DNS software programs.

### Background
#### DNS and DNSSEC
DNS maintains the mapping between domain names and their associated values, such as IPv4 addresses (A records) and mail server domain names (MX records). The original DNS protocol has security vulnerabilities, such as lack of authentication, making it susceptible to attacks like DNS hijacking and cache poisoning. DNSSEC was introduced to provide integrity and authenticity of DNS records using three new record types:
- **DNSKEY** records: Contain public keys used in DNSSEC.
- **RRSIG** records: Contain cryptographic signatures of DNS records.
- **DS** records: Hashes of DNSKEYs, uploaded to the parent DNS zone to construct a chain of trust.

#### TLSA Records
DANE introduces the TLSA record, which provides information to verify the certificate of a corresponding domain name. A TLSA record is stored for a specific location, combining a port number, protocol (TCP or UDP), and base domain name. For example, to request a TLSA record for an SMTP server with MX record `mail.example.com` and STARTTLS on port 25, the derived domain name is `_25._tcp.mail.example.com`.

A TLSA record consists of four fields:
- **Certificate Usage**: Specifies how the presented certificates from the TLS server can be validated. There are four usages: DANE-TA, DANE-EE, PKIX-TA, and PKIX-EE.
- **Selector**: Specifies the type of Certificate Association Data, indicating whether it is derived from a certificate or its subject public key.
- **Matching Type**: Specifies what Certificate Association Data presents, such as the original data, SHA-256 hash, or SHA-512 hash.
- **Certificate Association Data**: Contains the full data or a digest of a certificate or its public key.

#### DANE and DNSSEC
To leverage DANE, a client must use DNS resolvers that support DNSSEC or authenticate DNS records using DNSSEC. This ensures the integrity and authenticity of fetched DNS records, including TLSA records, preventing man-in-the-middle (MITM) and DNS cache poisoning attacks.

#### DANE and SMTP
SMTP lacks built-in security mechanisms, so the STARTTLS extension was introduced to encrypt messages within a TLS session. However, STARTTLS is vulnerable to downgrade attacks and does not specify what to do when the presented certificate is invalid. With DANE, the destination mail server can explicitly tell clients through TLSA records that it supports TLS, the presented certificate matches the TLSA records, and the TLSA records are not forged.

### Related Work
Liang et al. [83] studied the early stages of DANE deployment in 2014, focusing on HTTPS, SMTP, and XMPP. They found fewer than 1,000 TLSA records in 485K signed zones, with 13% being invalid, indicating rare DANE usage. Despite attempts to deploy DANE in web browsers, issues like middleboxes blocking TLSA records led to abandonment. Recently, a new TLS extension [56] proposes allowing web servers to deliver DANE records and DNSSEC authentication chains during TLS handshakes.

### DANE Deployment
Our study reveals significant mismanagement in the DANE ecosystem:
- **36% of TLSA records** cannot be validated due to missing or incorrect DNSSEC records.
- **14.17% of TLSA records** are inconsistent with their certificates.
- Only **four email service providers** support DANE for both outgoing and incoming emails, with two having issues with not checking the Certificate Usage in TLSA records.
- Two popular MTAs correctly support DANE for both incoming and outgoing emails in conjunction with four DNS implementations that support TLSA records and DNSSEC.

Overall, DANE deployment is increasing, especially in some country-code TLDs, but widespread mismanagement of certificates and TLSA records remains. Large email providers and MTA and DNS software providers can make changes to bring the benefits of DANE to end users.

### Conclusion
Our study highlights the need for better management and deployment practices in the DANE ecosystem. By addressing the identified issues, we can enhance the security and reliability of email transport.
