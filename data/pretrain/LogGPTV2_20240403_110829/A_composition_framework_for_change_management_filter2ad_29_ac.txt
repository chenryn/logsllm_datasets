CA-OCM Templates
The  templates  that  are  used  in  the  CA-OCM  are  grouped  by  the  five  project 
process phases: Concept, Initiating, Planning, Executing, and Closing. Each of 
the CA-OCM templates is listed and described along with the CA-PMF templates 
that  support  them.  Note  that  the  same  template  may  be  listed  in  multiple 
process  phases  as  it  may  be  used  throughout  the  effort.  To  access  the  CA-
OCM templates in a fillable format see the CA-OCM templates web page at the 
following link: http://projectresources.cio.ca.gov/ocm or by clicking here and 
expand the templates tab.
2.1  Concept Process Phase
The following CA-OCM templates accompany the Concept Process Phase:
•  Change Magnitude Assessment Template – The Change Magnitude 
Assessment is used to gain an understanding of the organization, define 
the relative size and magnitude of the change, and tailor OCM efforts to 
the organization’s priority areas. In addition, the assessment provides a 
high level overview for the OCM Practitioner to refer to when discussing 
the direction of the OCM effort.
•  Environmental Readiness Assessment Template – The Environmental 
Readiness Assessment serves as a tool to assess an organization’s level 
of readiness for change in four environmental areas: organizational 
readiness, leadership readiness, employee readiness, and supporting 
infrastructure readiness. Each environmental area is assessed based on 
statements regarding the readiness of that area, and assigned a numerical 
score, and ultimately, a priority level. The Environmental Readiness 
Assessment assists the OCM Practitioner in identifying OCM priority areas 
early in the project lifecycle.
•  Project Sponsorship Assessment Template – The Project Sponsorship 
Assessment is designed to be an informal working document that 
identifies and evaluates potential Project Sponsor candidates. This 
assessment helps identify a Sponsor’s level of availability, interest, 
influence, and knowledge of the change initiative.
•  OCM Concept Process Phase Checklist Template – The checklist 
identifies the key OCM activities that are to be completed during the 
Concept Process Phase.

this template may be useful to help gather information from multiple 
team members that may not have access or be familiar with other project 
schedule tools.
•  Project Sponsorship Action Register Template – The Project Sponsorship 
Action Register contains a list of the Sponsor’s required actions, the frequency 
of these actions, and the detailed responsibilities of the Sponsor. The Project 
Sponsor will use the Sponsorship Action Register to track his/her project 
responsibilities and record progress and completion of the Sponsor’s actions.
•  Project Team Guidelines Template – The Project Team Guidelines 
documents the defined set of expected behaviors that best fit the needs of 
the project team. It records and displays the behaviors in a visible location 
for the project team to review and implement.

document the OCM activities and tasks required during the current 
process phase required for the project. The OCM Practitioner coordinates 
closely with the Project Manager when developing the OCM Schedule.

communication.
•  Executive Interview Guide Template – The Executive Interview Guide is 
used to assess executive leaders involved in the change initiative. It helps 
the OCM Practitioner to foster initial relationship building with executive 
leaders, instigate thought among executive leaders about what is required 
for a successful change initiative, identify the political “lay of the land”, 
which helps the project team navigate potential political issues and 
boundary struggles, and build a picture of the executive leaders’ strengths, 
questions, and possible problems related to the change initiative.
•  Leadership Support Action Log Template – The Leadership Support 
Action Log is used to record all identified leadership and coaching actions.
•  Stakeholder Communication Questionnaire Template – The

messages, delivery channels, and preferred senders for different 
Stakeholder groups. It is designed to help identify key communication 
events, target audiences, and preferred communication methods and 
messages.

continuous improvement in which we learn from both the successes and 
mistakes of prior endeavors. In order for an organization to improve future 
performance, it is necessary to formally identify, acknowledge, analyze, and 
document the lessons learned. Collecting lessons learned over time adds 
to the organization’s body of knowledge related to project management 
and provides a rich source of information for current and future work. The 
objective of documenting lessons learned is to identify both the positive 
and negative lessons learned from the project, as well as to recommend 
corrective actions based on negative lessons learned observations.

Concept
Organizational  Change  Management  (OCM) 
activities  within  the  Concept  Process  Phase 
focus on establishing a foundation for the OCM 
effort by identifying and confirming the impact 
of  the  change.  Key  elements  of  the  Concept 
Process Phase are to understand the underlying 
change issues and environmental constraints, 
and to identify the Project Sponsor.

The Concept Process Phase is the first phase of the California Project Management 
Framework (CA-PMF) Project Management Lifecycle (PMLC). This process phase 
begins defining the proposed project to gain support for its formal launch and 
initiation. As shown in Figure 1-1, activities from two OCM knowledge areas occur 
within this process phase. Activities within these knowledge areas focus on:
•  Assessing high-level environmental readiness
•  Prioritizing OCM efforts for future process phases
•  Identifying the Project Sponsor
1.1  Introduction
The Concept Process Phase involves defining the business drivers, problems, and 
opportunities for a proposed project. Most implementation projects, including 
information  technology  (IT)  projects,  produce  change  -  not  only  in  processes 
and  systems,  but  also  in  organizations  and  people.  In  order  to  effectively 
manage  change  associated  with  implementation  projects,  the  unique  culture, 
environment, and history of an organization need to be considered. Understanding 
the importance of “people-related” elements in driving change is the first step 
towards  successfully  managing  organizational  change.  The  two  knowledge 
areas that are active during this process phase, OCM Lifecycle Management and 
Leadership Support, set the foundation for the future OCM effort.

OCM Lifecycle Management
In  order  to  identify  people-related  priorities  and  define  the  overall  OCM 
approach, the readiness of the organization, its leaders, its employees, and its 
supporting infrastructure will need to be assessed. The Environmental Readiness 
Assessment  template  utilized  in  this  process  phase  provides  information  to 
help identify the OCM approach and priorities early in the project.
Leadership Support
Identifying  the  correct  Project  Sponsor  is  important  in  this  initial  process 
phase. Having strong project sponsorship throughout the project is critical to 
a project’s success, as the Project Sponsor is responsible for many important 
tasks, including:
•  Deciding whether or not a project should be undertaken
•  Providing funding, resources, and support for the project
•  Suspending or canceling the project
• 
Ensuring the design of the system or other project solution meets  
business goals
•  Actively leading project teams to address risks and resolve project issues
•  Acting as the senior spokesperson to communicate the project vision and 
project status to the project team and other Stakeholders.
Once all OCM-related Concept Process Phase activities have been completed, 
the OCM Practitioner will complete the OCM Concept Process Phase Checklist. 
Figure 1-2 shows the inputs, activities, and outputs of the two knowledge areas 
that occur and the overall goal of this process phase.
