User: How to use Ansible automated operation and maintenance tool to configure server and application environment? Please provide a basic Ansible Playbook example.
Assistant: Ansible is a very popular automated operation and maintenance tool that helps administrators automate the management of remote servers and application environments. Here is a basic Ansible Playbook example: ``` --- hosts: web become: true tasks: - name: ensure apache2 is installed apt: name=apache2 state=installed - name: ensure apache2 is running service: name= apache2 state=started - name: ensure index.html is present copy: src=index.html dest=/var/www/html - name: ensure permissions are set file: path=/var/www/html/index.html mode =0644 ``` The role of this Playbook is to install, start and configure the Apache2 server on the remote host named "web", and copy a file named "index.html" to the web root directory and set its permissions . This is a basic Ansible Playbook example, but it can be extended for more complex and expressive operations to help administrators automate the management of server and application environments.
