It appears that when there is a path outside the plotting limits then not all
the path coordinates get plotted. When I run the code below with `xmax=1.1`
versus `xmax=1.0`, the axvspan is plotted wrong in latex. Inspection of the
pgf file for the two versions of `xmax` indicates that a `\pgfpathlineto`
command is missing in the `xmax=1.1` version. I've traced it to
`_print_pgf_path()` in the backend and the line `for points, code in
path.iter_segments(transform, clip=clip):` which is asking for clipped points.
Python Code
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    fig = plt.figure()
    ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
    ax.plot([0,1],[0,1],'-k')
    ax.set_xlim(0,1)
    ax.axvspan(xmin=0.5, xmax=1.1)
    fig.savefig('test.pgf')
Latex code
    \documentclass {article}
    \usepackage{pgf}
    \begin{document}
        \begin{figure}
            \centering
            \input{test.pgf}
        \end{figure}
    \end{document
Here is a pic of the result after compiled with latex (pdflatex or xelatex)

However, saving to .pdf produces the right result
