I recently installed the CPU-only version of TensorFlow 1.0 on a Windows machine using the pip installer. I am currently attempting to run the Android example using CMake, as described in the following GitHub repository: [TensorFlow Android CMake Instructions](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/android/cmake).

To begin, I cloned the latest version of the TensorFlow repository and created a new Android Studio project. I followed the instructions provided on the webpage, making the necessary modifications to the Gradle files. During this process, I discovered that the correct configuration should be:

```gradle
debugCompile project(path: ':TensorFlow-Android-Inference', configuration: 'debug')
releaseCompile project(path: ':TensorFlow-Android-Inference', configuration: 'release')
```

Instead of:

```gradle
debugCompile project(path: ':tensorflow_inference', configuration: 'debug')
releaseCompile project(path: ':tensorflow_inference', configuration: 'release')
```

However, I am now encountering a build error that states: "Error: Project :app declares a dependency from configuration 'releaseCompile' to configuration 'release' which is not declared in the descriptor for project :TensorFlow-Android-Inference."

Has anyone else attempted this or could someone provide a detailed explanation of how to use CMake to build the project? Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
