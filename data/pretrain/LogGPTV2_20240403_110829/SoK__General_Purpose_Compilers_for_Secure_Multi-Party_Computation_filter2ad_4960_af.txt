rics that demonstrate the expressive capabilities of a
framework and serve as a baseline for performance com-
parison. Standardized benchmarking has some known
issues: certain metrics may not be relevant
to every
protocol; compilers may optimize for performance on
benchmark problems rather than in the general case; and
the performance measurement issues from Section V-E
remain. We hope that careful design of benchmarking
problems will mitigate these issues and provide a useful
tool for practitioners in the future.
C. Standardization and Benchmarks
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Many of these frameworks are designed around a
particular feature, such as a type system or an optimiza-
tion technique. Standardizing essential features common
across frameworks allows researchers to concentrate
their efforts on core features of their systems and pro-
vides a level of consistency for users. Standardization
could also set a more consistent baseline for performance
The authors would like to thank the developers and
maintainers of each framework for their help and feed-
back, and the anonymous reviewers for their helpful
comments. This research was sponsored in part by ONR
grant (N00014-15-1-2750) “SynCrypt: Automated Syn-
thesis of Cryptographic Constructions” and NSF grant
CNS-1513671.
