I'm trying to move a very simple OpenCV application to android. The code tries
to access the camera from a qt for android . My qt code simply tries to access
the camera using cv::VideoCapture like so:  
cv::VideoCapture cap(0); // /dev/video0  
Camera cannot be opened,Permissions are open,chmod 777 /dev/video0,The camera
still doesn't open.  
What did I add less? Or is my method wrong, Android can't open the camera in
this way at all?  
Opencv version: 4.1.1  
qt version: 5.12.3  
android ndk: android-ndk-r19c
