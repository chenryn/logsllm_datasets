The selectivity of the reactor has decreased from 87% to below 82%, and the secondary reaction has increased by an average of 4.32% (Fig. 6.7a). The selectivity, which is calculated based on the ethylene consumed in both primary and secondary reactions, has also dropped (Fig. 6.7b). This indicates that the increase in the secondary reaction has a more significant impact on the reagents consumed than on the products produced. Therefore, the consumption of reagents is a more critical metric in this scenario.

Figure 6.7c shows the conversion rates for the main reagents in the reactor. Ideally, the conversion rate of acetic acid should be around 37%, approximately 2% higher than the oxygen conversion. However, due to the attack, the conversion rate of acetic acid has fallen below that of oxygen, indicating a change in reaction kinetics. This is because the newly induced secondary reaction consumes more oxygen than the primary reaction. Additionally, the consumption of ethylene has increased. Consequently, the amount of the primary reaction has decreased, leading to less acetic acid conversion and an increase in ethylene combustion. The attack on XMV(2) has resulted in a significant reduction in the production of the final product (Fig. 6.7d).

### 6.6 Discussion

Our initial attacker model restricts the attacker from violating any operational constraints. In reality, an attacker may suppress alarms while providing the operator with false process values, as discussed in our other work [29, 30]. We investigated whether it might be beneficial for the attacker to violate operational constraints to cause more damage. While we could nearly double the loss in steady-state attacks, the increase in periodic attacks was modest. Violating operational alarms can eventually move the process into an unsafe state, triggering a process shutdown via interlocks. Suppressing safety alarms and interlock triggers requires more advanced hacking techniques.

An attacker is not limited to a single scenario; multiple attacks can be combined. This is often referred to as getting "multiple bites at the apple" in hacker circles. An attacker may not have complete knowledge of the process and environment, and it may be impossible to fully test the code before deployment. Chaining multiple attacks into a single payload maximizes the chance of achieving the desired effect.

### 7. Damn Vulnerable Chemical Process

One of the challenges in cyber-physical security research is the lack of large-scale test beds for studying complex attacks and their effects on physical processes. Building such a test bed requires significant financial investment, specialized personnel, and regulatory permissions. Additionally, there are costs associated with rebuilding the test bed if it is damaged during successful offensive experiments. A more affordable alternative is to use simulation models for cyber-physical experimentation.

In 1993, Down and Vogel published a model of an industrial chemical process (Tennessee Eastman Process – TE) for developing, studying, and evaluating process control technologies [15]. This model has been widely used in the process control community and has become one of the most popular research process models. The ICS security community has also adopted the TE model for studying the impacts of cyber attacks on physical processes [26, 43, 18, 7, 8].

However, the TE model lacks detailed information about chemical reactions and equipment. To address this, Luyben and Tyreus published details of an industrial process for the production of Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAC) in 1997 [39]. This model includes real non-ideal chemical components, a realistically large process flow sheet, and several standard unit operations, making it more comprehensive than the TE model.

### 7.1 Framework Description

Damn Vulnerable Chemical Process (DVCP) is an open-source framework developed for cyber-physical security experimentation based on the TE and VAC models [27, 28]. DVCP allows researchers to study how to convert a cyber attack into a successful cyber-physical attack. It is useful for designing individual and complex attacks, and for developing risk assessment methods, robust control algorithms, and attack detection techniques.

**Tennessee Eastman Process:**
- We use the TE Matlab model developed by Ricker [48] and redesigned it to include simulations of data integrity and DoS attacks on sensor signals and manipulated variables (actuators). The Simulink model is multilayered, and care must be taken to ensure correct implementation and propagation of attack parameters through the layers to individual controllers.
- We enhanced the Simulink model with a user interface that allows users to set up attacks with a few mouse clicks. Users can select attack value, time, duration, and frequency.
- We modified the original code to introduce randomness in the simulations, allowing for statistical evaluation of attack strategies.

**Vinyl Acetate Process:**
- The authors of the Vinyl Acetate process built a rigorous nonlinear dynamic model to verify the feasibility of simulating the plant. The simulation model was implemented in TMODS, DuPont’s in-house dynamic simulation environment, and is not publicly available.
- To make the process model accessible, Luyben et al. developed a Matlab simulation model for VAM. We created a Simulink model of the VAC process, which provides an interactive, graphical environment for modeling, simulating, and analyzing dynamic systems.
- We instrumented the Simulink model with a user interface for updating process parameters and setting up attacks on individual components. We also fixed several implementation mistakes and made improvements to the control model to enhance stability.

### 7.3 Potential Applications

The models can be used standalone or as a physical layer of the distributed industrial control systems reference architecture. They are useful for researching security questions at the upper layers of the reference architecture, including networks and components. The process models encompass layers 0-1 of the reference architecture, covering the process and basic/regulatory control.
