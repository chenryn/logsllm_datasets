User: I got both python2 and python3 installed in my debian machine. But when i try to invoke the python interpreter by just typing 'python' in bash, python2 pops up and not python3. Since I am working with the latter at the moment, It would be easier to invoke python3 by just typing python. Please guide me through this.
Assistant: Well, you can simply create a virtualenv with the python3.x using this command:

virtualenv -p <path-to-python3.x> <virtualenvname>
