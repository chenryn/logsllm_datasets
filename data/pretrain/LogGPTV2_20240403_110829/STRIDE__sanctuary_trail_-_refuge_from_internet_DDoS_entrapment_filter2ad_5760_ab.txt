later. For simplicity, we focus on presenting STRIDE using
bidirectional links and elaborate how STRIDE can support
directional links in Section 8.
Bandwidth classes.
width is split up into three bandwidth classes:
As shown in Figure 2, link band-
• Static class is for guaranteed, persistent long-term band-
width that ADs allocate, for example to protect initial
connection setup request packets between a source and
a destination. Each AD allocates a small portion of its
total bandwidth (e.g., 5–15%) to this class.
• Dynamic class is for guaranteed, short-term end-to-end
bandwidth allocations, and supports high-capacity chan-
nels. The dynamic class may account for the majority of
the link capacity (e.g., 60–65%).
• Best-eﬀort (BE) class is allocated with the remainder of
the bandwidth (e.g., 30%).
In case of congestion within a bandwidth class, it can take
over the unused bandwidth from the other (uncongested)
classes using statistical multiplexing.
2
The bandwidth of a path is divided into separate channels, and
multiple channels dynamically share the bandwidth within a path.
417Within the static or dynamic bandwidth class, an AD
can assign diﬀerent bandwidth sub-classes (e.g., 500 Kbps,
1 Mbps, etc.) to individual paths/ﬂows based on empirically
measured ﬂow size distribution. For example, the fraction of
dynamic bandwidth allocated to the 1 Mbps sub-class can
be derived based on the fraction of ﬂows with 1 Mbps rate in
the current Internet. We provide guidelines on how an AD
can divide its total link capacity to the above three classes
in Appendix A.
A half-path announced by a PCB is a path on the BE
class, oﬀering no guarantees. However, for each upstream
AD, an endpoint AD can activate up to k BE half-paths
to convert each into a static half-path, oﬀering a guaran-
teed amount of bandwidth from that AD to the TDC. The
parameter k is determined by contract and is enforced by
provider ADs.
Static and BE channels. A communication channel is
a conduit to carry traﬃc from a source to a destination. A
single half-path can be used as a channel to reach the TDC,
and two half-paths can be combined to form an end-to-end
channel between a source and a destination. In this paper,
we call the half-path of the source the up-path (as traﬃc on
that channel traverses ADs upwards towards the TDC) and
the half-path of the destination the down-path. If two BE
half-paths (i.e., half-paths using the BE bandwidth class)
are combined, the resulting channel is a BE channel, and
similarly, two static half-paths create a static channel. Hy-
brid channels are also possible, and we will make use of a
static up-path that is combined with a BE down-path. Pack-
ets ﬂowing through diﬀerent types of channels have diﬀerent
properties.
An endhost can send a request on

static, BE, or hybrid channels to reserve a dynamic chan-
nel, which provides high bandwidth for a short amount of
time (on the order of seconds to enable fast revocation). All
ADs, including the destination, need to agree on the amount
of bandwidth oﬀered for the dynamic channel. This chan-
nel is similar to network capabilities [4, 26] with bandwidth
guarantees [29].
One surprising aspect of STRIDE is that only the access
routers in the endpoint ADs have to keep per-ﬂow state for
ﬂow admission and policing. STRIDE does not require inter-
mediate routers to maintain any per-ﬂow or per-path state
in the fastpath for forwarded traﬃc; only the initial channel
establishment requests require slowpath operations for ad-
mission control. Performing per-ﬂow management at edge
routers is shown to be practical [21], and we can further
relax this state requirement using probabilistic detection of
the largest ﬂows. With these ingredients, we construct a
series of mechanisms that achieve the highly available com-
munication we strive for.
4.1 Static Half-Path Setup
We now describe how an endpoint AD (ADS) establishes
a guaranteed static path (i.e., a path using static bandwidth
class) to its TDC.
 Bandwidth announcement: The TDC assesses its link
capacity and adds information regarding current reservable
static bandwidth to periodic PCBs (TDC and PCBs are
explained in Section 2). The TDC ensures no congestion
on its internal links even if the announced static bandwidth
becomes fully reserved. As a PCB travels from the TDC
to endpoint ADs, each AD adds information regarding its
TD Core (TDC)

own bandwidth availability. In particular, an intermediate
AD splits the reservable bandwidth and announces the split
amount for each of its children for the static path. Figure 3
depicts the bandwidth availability announcement (denoted
by the numbers) of PCBs for the static path. This particular
diagram shows that ADS has three possible static paths:

50→ ADE
40→ ADS
25→ ADS
25→ ADS
 Activation: Recall that each endpoint AD learns a set
of BE half-paths to the TDC through PCB propagation.
The AD can then activate k BE half-paths per provider AD
to static class as follows. Upon receiving a PCB with the
bandwidth availability information, ADS sends an activa-
tion request to the TDC to reserve the static bandwidth
as speciﬁed in the PCBs. While forwarding this request,
all the intermediate ADs temporarily reserve the requested
static bandwidth for ADS if they can support the request.
For example, ADS may request 40 units of the static-class
bandwidth through path , 25 units through path , etc.
 Conﬁrmation: The TDC sends a conﬁrmation to ADS
for the guaranteed static path that ADS (and all of its
hosts) can use to reach the TDC. The new opaque ﬁelds
constructed along the conﬁrmation acts as a static path to-
ken that enables ADS to communicate with the TDC on
the static path. Note that STRIDE allows each endpoint
AD to create up to k static half-paths per provider AD, and
each endpoint AD has the freedom to keep a subset of static
half-paths in private for privileged access, as we will explain
in step  below, while registering others at the Path Server
for public usage.
4.2 Static and BE Channel Setup
After the half-path setup, each endpoint AD obtains a set
of static bandwidth-guaranteed half-paths in addition to a
set of BE half-paths provided by the original PCBs. We
now describe how two half-paths (i.e., an up-path and a
down-path) can be combined to setup an end-to-end chan-
nel. Combining static and BE half-paths results in four
types of channels (i.e., static, BE, static+BE, or BE+static)
with diﬀerent guarantees, as summarized in Table 1.
 End-to-end path selection: When source src of ADS
wants to communicate with destination dst of ADD, src
queries the Path Server for the down-paths to reach dst. Src
reaches the Path Server in the TDC using a BE or static half-
418path as a communication channel. The Path Server then re-
turns unconcealed static down-paths and/or BE down-paths
to src. Alternatively, dst can inform src of a private static
path over an Out-Of-Band (OOB) channel. By combining
one of its up-paths and one of the down-paths provided by
the Path Server, src now establishes an end-to-end channel
for sending a dynamic channel setup request.
4.3 Dynamic Channel Setup
 Dynamic channel setup request: To acquire guaran-
teed bandwidth along a dynamic channel, src sends a dy-
namic channel setup request on this newly-established end-
to-end (static, BE, or hybrid) channel. While this request
travels toward dst, all ADs on the path specify the band-
width that they can provide for the dynamic channel and
forward it toward dst.
In case src sends packets beyond the allocated static band-
width of the static up-path, ADS sets an overuse bit on
each extra packet to utilize unused static or BE bandwidth,
thereby indicating that the extra packets are beyond per-
mitted allocation for eﬃcient traﬃc policing.
In case src cannot send the request on the static channel,
possibly due to congestion on any of the announced down-
paths, STRIDE ﬂexibly allows the endpoint AD to send re-
quests on the BE channel. We discuss several alternatives
for channel composition and their priorities in Section 5.3.
 Dynamic-class bandwidth allocation: When dst re-
ceives src’s dynamic channel setup request, dst can deduce
sustainable dynamic-class bandwidth for src based on the
reported dynamic-class bandwidth availability of all the in-
termediate ADs (e.g., minimum of the dynamic-class band-
width allocations of all the intermediate ADs). Then dst
sends this information to src, during which the dynamic ca-
pability is constructed on the return path. STRIDE provides
ﬂexible options for sending the reply. For example, dst may
send the reply through the allocated dynamic channel or
through the reverse channel that sent the request.
 Guaranteed data transmission: When src receives
the reply, it can enjoy sending data traﬃc using the dedi-
cated dynamic-class bandwidth by embedding the dynamic
capability in the data packets. Since this bandwidth is short-
lived, src may renew this dynamic-class bandwidth using ac-
tual data packets. Similar to step , src can also send more
than permitted dynamic bandwidth allocation, in which case
ADS sets the overuse bit for the extra data traﬃc.
5. STRIDE PROTOCOL DESCRIPTION
In this section, we elaborate on STRIDE’s mechanisms.
5.1 Static Half-Path Setup
 Bandwidth announcement: Upon receiving a PCB, an
intermediate AD (ADi) forwards it to the downstream AD
(ADi+1) after appending the bandwidth information, which
includes: (1) currently reservable static-class bandwidth for
ADi+1, (2) currently underutilized static-class bandwidth
that ADi+1 can use, (3) currently available dynamic-class
bandwidth, and (4) currently available BE-class bandwidth.
This bandwidth information enables downstream ADs and
endhosts to deduce congestion status and make informed de-
cisions in selecting paths. When a PCB reaches an endpoint
AD, it contains a path from the TDC to the endpoint AD
with reservable bandwidth that can be provided once this
path is activated (details in step ).
On each PCB, ADi adds an opaque ﬁeld Oi, as described
in Eq. (1). The resulting collection of opaque ﬁelds in the
PCB access the BE channel on the route that the PCB tra-
versed. Note that ADi should use diﬀerent MAC keys to
construct opaque ﬁelds for diﬀerent bandwidth classes and
expiration time, so that an attacker cannot forge an opaque
ﬁeld for another traﬃc class or extend the expiration time.
For example, the MAC key Ki can be derived from the mas-
ter secret key ˆKi: Ki = F ˆKi (BE, timestamp), where F (·)
is a pseudo-random function.
Path diversity vs. quality. The bandwidth announce-
ment mechanism in STRIDE enables an AD to divide band-
width among its customers. However, bandwidth allocation
is still challenging because of the tradeoﬀ between path di-
versity (i.e., the number of diﬀerent paths) and path quality
(i.e., the allocated bandwidth to each path). An interme-
diate AD can oﬀer higher path diversity by propagating a
PCB to more children (i.e., egress routers). Yet, increasing
path diversity reduces the bandwidth that can be allocated
to each child AD since the bandwidth contained in a PCB
must be split for all children recursively as the PCB propa-
gates to downstream ADs.
To address this issue, STRIDE uses a bandwidth overbook-
ing technique to enhance path diversity and quality simul-
taneously as follows. An endpoint AD can choose up to k
paths out of all announced paths. This indicates that not all
announced paths will be activated. Hence, intermediate ADs
can announce greater reservable bandwidth (i.e., overbook)
to their downstream ADs than the actual link capacity, and
defer the actual bandwidth reservation later during the ac-
tivation step (). However, if intermediate ADs overbook
their bandwidth aggressively, path activation could be fre-
quently denied. To address this issue, STRIDE allows each
intermediate AD to overbook its bandwidth such that the
probability of path-activation failure along its link is below
a certain threshold, which we analyze in Appendix B.
From the bandwidth announcement in the latest PCB, an
endpoint AD learns the amount of static bandwidth it may
reserve on the corresponding route. Note that the actual
allocation is not performed until the activation step (), as
the reservable bandwidth may be greater than what an in-
termediate AD can support because of overbooking or stale
bandwidth information.
 Activation: An endpoint AD requests for a path ac-
tivation along the reverse path to the TDC. Each request
consists of desired (1) expiration time of the path, and
(2) amount of static-class bandwidth, which does not ex-
ceed the announced reservable bandwidth in the latest PCB.
STRIDE considers an activation request as a control mes-
sage, like PCBs, that is protected from data-plane DDoS
attacks. To avoid congestion on the control plane, each AD
can rate-limit the activation requests on a per customer ba-
sis and advertise the limit with the reservable bandwidth
during the announcement.
Upon receiving an activation request, an intermediate AD,
which has suﬃcient unallocated bandwidth (i.e., spare ca-
pacity ≥ desired bandwidth), temporarily allocates the re-
quested bandwidth for this path. Otherwise, the AD sends
back an error message. Also, to minimize bandwidth waste,
the AD recycles temporarily allocated bandwidth when the
activation fails, which is indicated by the lack of a conﬁrma-
tion (step ) or an error message, before the arrival of the
next PCB.
419For eﬃcient bandwidth management (e.g., allocation and
recycling), the expiration time and bandwidth is chosen from
a pre-deﬁned ﬁnite set of values. For example, the expiration
time can be 6, 12, 18, or 24 hours; the sub-class bandwidth
assigned to each activation request can be 64 Kbps, 128
Kbps, etc.
Each endpoint AD is allowed to activate up to k distinct
paths per upstream AD (or provider). This policy is made in
accordance with the observation that in the current Internet,
large endpoint ADs often subscribe to multiple providers for
increased capacity and path diversity. This k-path policy
can be enforced either by the providers or the Path Server
in the TDC.
 Conﬁrmation: The TDC informs the endpoint AD of a
successful static path activation by sending a conﬁrmation
message along the activated path. The conﬁrmation message
contains the expiration time and the allocated bandwidth.
The TDC also updates the Path Server to include this ac-
tivated path. Upon receiving the valid conﬁrmation from
the TDC, each intermediate AD on the path converts the
temporarily-allocated bandwidth to be long term (until the
expiration time).
Before forwarding the conﬁrmation to the next hop, the
AD adds a new opaque ﬁeld using a diﬀerent MAC key
Ki, derived from the master secret key ˆKi similarly as be-
fore: Ki = F ˆKi (static, timestamp, BW ), where BW is the
amount of bandwidth allocated to the path. After receiving
the conﬁrmation, the endpoint AD can forward packets on
the static channel of the path by including a static path to-
ken, which consists of the new opaque ﬁelds, in the header
of packets.
5.2 Static and BE Channel Setup
After the half-path setup, endpoint ADs learn multiple
long-term, bandwidth-guaranteed static half-paths (in ad-
dition to multiple BE half-paths) to communicate with the
