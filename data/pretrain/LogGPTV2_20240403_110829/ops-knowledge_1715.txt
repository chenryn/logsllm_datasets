User: How to analyze network traffic and dissect the problems in it? Please provide a toolchain.
Assistant: Analyzing network traffic and finding problems in it usually requires the following tools: 1. Wireshark: A popular network protocol analysis software that can capture and analyze network packets. It can identify and display information of various protocols, such as TCP, UDP, HTTP, DNS, etc. Wireshark can help identify issues such as network bottlenecks, network latency, and port scanning. 2. tcpdump: A command-line network protocol analysis tool for capturing and displaying network packets. tcpdump allows you to capture packets in a finer-grained manner, making it easier to identify network problems. 3. ntopng: A tool for monitoring network traffic, which can display network traffic data in real time, supports cross-platform, and can display the data graphically. ntopng can help determine what kind of traffic is dominating your network bandwidth. 4. tcptraceroute: a network diagnostic tool similar to the traceroute tool, the difference is that tcptraceroute uses TCP packets instead of UDP or ICMP packets for route tracking, so that fault points can be found more effectively. 5. ping: A command-line tool used to check whether the network connection is available. It can be used to test network performance, locate where the problem occurs, and find the cause of the network failure. 6. MTR (My Traceroute): A tool that combines the advantages of ping and traceroute. It adds the function of Ping command on the basis of traceroute, which can continuously ping all network devices on the path, so as to find the cause of network failure.
