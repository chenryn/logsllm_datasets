channel attribute STATCHL as QMGR, use the following MQSC command:
ALTER QMGR STATCHL(MEDIUM)
To enable statistics information collection, at a medium level of detail, for all automatically defined
cluster-sender channels, use the following MQSC command:
ALTER QMGR STATACLS(MEDIUM)
Statistics message generation
Statistics messages are generated at configured intervals, and when a queue manager shuts down in a
controlled fashion.
The configured interval is controlled by the STATINT queue manager attribute, which specifies the
interval, in seconds, between the generation of statistics messages. The default statistics interval is
1800 seconds (30 minutes). To change the statistics interval, use the MQSC command ALTER QMGR
and specify the STATINT parameter. For example, to change the statistics interval to 900 seconds (15
minutes) use the following MQSC command:
ALTER QMGR STATINT(900)
To write the currently collected statistics data to the statistics queue before the statistics collection
interval is due to expire, use the MQSC command RESET QMGR TYPE(STATISTICS). Issuing this
IBM MQ Monitoring and performance 145
command causes the collected statistics data to be written to the statistics queue and a new statistics
data collection interval to begin.
Displaying accounting and statistics information
To use the information recorded in accounting and statistics messages, run an application such as the
amqsmon sample program to transform the recorded information into a suitable format
Accounting and statistics messages are written to the system accounting and statistics queues. amqsmon
is a sample program supplied with IBM MQ that processes messages from the accounting and statistics
queues and displays the information to the screen in a readable form.
Because amqsmon is a sample program, you can use the supplied source code as template for writing
your own application to process accounting or statistics messages, or modify the amqsmon source code to
meet your own particular requirements.
amqsmon (Display formatted monitoring information)
Use the amqsmon sample program to display in a readable format the information contained within
accounting and statistics messages. The amqsmon program reads accounting messages from the
accounting queue, SYSTEM.ADMIN.ACCOUNTING.QUEUE. and reads statistics messages from the
statistics queue, SYSTEM.ADMIN.STATISTICS.QUEUE.

Parameter
Required parameters
-t Type
The type of messages to process. Specify Type as one of the following:
accounting
Accounting records are processed. Messages are read from the system queue,
SYSTEM.ADMIN.ACCOUNTING.QUEUE, unless you have used the -n parameter to select a
particular queue to read from.
146 Monitoring and Performance for IBM MQ
statistics
Statistics records are processed. Messages are read from the system queue,
SYSTEM.ADMIN.STATISTICS.QUEUE, unless you have used the -n parameter to select a particular
queue to read from.
Optional Parameters
-m QMgrName
The name of the queue manager from which accounting or statistics messages are to be processed.
If you do not specify this parameter, the default queue manager is used.
-a
Process messages containing MQI records only.
Only display MQI records. Messages not containing MQI records will always be left on the queue they
were read from.
-q QueueName
QueueName is an optional parameter.
If QueueName is not supplied: Displays queue accounting and queue statistics records
only.
If QueueName is supplied: Displays queue accounting and queue statistics records
for the queue specified by QueueName only.
If -b is not specified then the accounting and statistics
messages from which the records came are discarded.
Since accounting and statistics messages can also
contain records from other queues, if -b is not specified
then unseen records can be discarded.
-c ChannelName
ChannelName is an optional parameter.
If ChannelName is not supplied: Displays channel statistics records only.
If ChannelName is supplied: Displays channel statistics records for the channel
specified by ChannelName only.
If -b is not specified then the statistics messages from
which the records came are discarded. Since statistics
messages can also contain records from other channels,
if -b is not specified then unseen records can be
discarded.
This parameter is available when displaying statistics messages only, ( -t statistics ).
-qm qm name
This parameter is optional but if you specify it you must provide a queue manager name
Specifies that only accounting or statistics messages produced by the given queue manager should
be read from the queue. Typically, only used if messages from several queue managers have been
forwarded to a central queue manager.
-i ConnectionId
Displays records related to the connection identifier specified by ConnectionId only.
This parameter is available when displaying accounting messages only, ( -t accounting ).
If -b is not specified then the statistics messages from which the records came are discarded. Since
statistics messages can also contain records from other channels, if -b is not specified then unseen
records can be discarded.
IBM MQ Monitoring and performance 147
-n input queue
The queue to read accounting or statistics messages from. If this is not specified the default queue for
the chosen -t  is used.
-b
Browse messages.
Messages are retrieved non-destructively.
-d Depth
The maximum number of messages that can be processed.
If you do not specify this parameter, then an unlimited number of messages can be processed.
-w TimeOut
Time maximum number of seconds to wait for a message to become available.
If you do not specify this parameter, amqsmon will end once there are no more messages to process.
-s StartTime
Process messages put after the specified StartTime only.
StartTime is specified in the format yyyy-mm-dd hh.mm.ss. If a date is specified without a time,
then the time will default to 00.00.00 on the date specified. Times are in GMT.
For the effect of not specifying this parameter, see Note 1.
-e EndTime
Process messages put before the specified EndTime only.
The EndTime is specified in the format yyyy-mm-dd hh.mm.ss. If a date is specified without a time,
then the time will default to 23.59.59 on the date specified. Times are in GMT.
For the effect of not specifying this parameter, see Note 1.
-l Parameter
Only display the selected fields from the records processed. Parameter is a comma-separated list
of integer values, with each integer value mapping to the numeric constant of a field, see amqsmon
example 5.
If you do not specify this parameter, then all available fields are displayed.
Note:
1.If you do not specify -s StartTime or -e EndTime, the messages that can be processed are not restricted
by put time.

Finding the mapping for ApplicationName (3024) and ConnectionId (7006)
Use this topic to explain how the variables used in the example are found, for monitoring accounting data.
Summary:
• 3024 means MQCACF_APPL_NAME which is the ApplicationName
• 7006 means MQBACF_CONNECTION_ID which is the ConnectionId
To find out the mapping you need to carry out two procedures:
