more open were more likely to share photos.
D. Photo order effects on sharing likelihood
Lastly,
though the order of photos was randomized for
each participant, we examined whether fatigue throughout
the experiment inﬂuenced photo sharing likelihood. Of po-
tential interest is whether participants’ photo-sharing decisions
change over the relatively large number of decisions they made
in the study. To investigate this, we split the ratings into four
quartiles based on the order that the photos were presented to
each participant. We then used a repeated-measures ANOVA
comparing average share score of the four quartiles of photos,
applying a Greenhouse-Geisser adjustment as needed, which
revealed that photo order was not signiﬁcantly associated with
likelihood to share (F (2.80, 1056.64) = 2.26, p = 0.08,
p = .006). This was also the case when comparing average
η2
likelihood to share for the ﬁrst ten and last ten photos using
a paired-samples t-test (t(378) = 1.49, p = .14). Thus we
conclude that there were no signiﬁcant order effects due to
fatigue.
E. Summary of Results
These ﬁndings demonstrate a counter-intuitive effect of the
experimental manipulation, where participants in the privacy
condition reported a greater likelihood of sharing photos of
others than participants in the baseline condition. Given our
predictions for this study, these ﬁndings are clearly paradox-
ical. Privacy reminders may have the unintended effect of
increasing privacy violations.
In addition, there were a number of individual difference
factors that were associated with likelihood of photo sharing.
First, participants who were high photo sharers on real-
world social media platforms were more likely to want to
share photos in the experiment than low or medium photo
sharers, regardless of how the photo portrayed the subject.
Second, male participants were more likely to share negatively
valenced photos than female participants, though female and
male participants were equally likely to share positively va-
lenced photos. These ﬁndings contribute to our understanding
of online privacy by identifying social media users who,
generally speaking, are most likely to violate the privacy of
others and who may be particularly important target groups
for privacy-related interventions.
Of the measures entered into the regression model, so-
cial media usage, privacy experiences and preferences, and
experimental condition were signiﬁcant predictors of overall
likelihood to share. Speciﬁcally, frequency of photo sharing on
real social media platforms and personal privacy rating were
most strongly related to sharing likelihood. The correlation
between real-world photo sharing and likelihood of sharing
during the experiment suggest that the present study design
is a valid way of understanding decisions to share online.
The correlation might be even higher if photos were more
representative of real-world photos shared by participants, for
example, more self-relevant images like those of friends and
family. The results also indicate that past photo sharing is the
best predictor of future decisions to share. Personal privacy
preference was also signiﬁcantly related to decisions to share
photos of other people, suggesting that people who value their
own privacy more, in turn, also value the privacy of others.
F. Follow-up study
The central ﬁndings of Study 2 were opposite of our hy-
pothesis, revealing that the privacy prime increased rather than
decreased photo sharing. To better understand this paradoxical
effect, we conducted a follow-up study asking participants to
explain their sharing decisions for a subsample of photos from
our original study. Past work has shown that drawing attention
to privacy concerns can sometimes backﬁre. For example,
Trudeau and colleagues found that when participants were
primed to think about privacy they made ‘worse’ decisions in
sharing private information on social media, indicating they
were willing to engage in riskier decisions and less concerned
about privacy after being explicitly reminded of it [61]. Thus,
perhaps our privacy prime condition actually made perceivers
less concerned about others’ privacy. To test this, we randomly
assigned a new sample of participants to our Baseline or
Privacy condition but had them view only six photos selected
from the previous study. Their task was to describe in two
to three sentences why they would or would not share them.
Of interest was whether participants in the privacy condition
would express less concern about others’ privacy. If true,
reminding participants of a value they do not actually hold
(i.e., protecting others privacy) could ironically lead them to
act against it, which would explain our previously observed
results.
1) Stimuli and Procedure: One hundred participants were
recruited via Amazons Mechanical Turk. Half of them were
randomly assigned to the baseline condition and other half to
the PP condition. After providing informed consent, partici-
pants viewed six photos in random order. The stimuli consisted
of the six photos from Study 2 for which participants showed
the largest difference in sharing scores between the control
and PP conditions. These photos also included both negatively
and positively valenced photos. The procedure was the same
as Study 2, except that participants were also asked to explain
their likelihood to share using at least 200 characters in a text
box at the bottom of the screen.
2) Coding Measures: Four coders, unaware of the partic-
ipants’ condition, read their responses and created a coding
scheme to capture the main themes present in the participants’
written responses (Table III). Codes included: concern for
privacy; no concern for privacy; mentioning the person/people
in the photo; understanding the meme; personally relating to
the photo; not personally relating to the photo; viewing the
photo as funny; viewing the photo as not funny; considering
the photo inappropriate; and whether sharing the photo re-
ﬂects positively or negatively on the self. We also coded for
nonsensical responses, and found 13% of the responses had

this code. Those responses were removed from subsequent
analyses. Participant responses to each photo were coded for
the presence or absence of each code. One hundred responses
were coded independently by all four coders, after which the
four coders reﬁned the coding scheme and reached agreement
on all responses by discussion. Two coders then coded each of
the remaining responses independently. Inter-rater reliability
was measured with Gwet’s AC1 [62], which is reported to
be less affected by prevalence and marginal probabilities than
Cohen’s Kappa [63]. The mean coding reliability across all
seven categories was 0.83, and ranged from 0.72 to 0.95. All
coding disagreements were resolved by discussion.
3) Results: Of primary interest was whether privacy con-
cerns were higher or lower in the privacy condition relative
to the baseline condition. We examined the extent to which
condition (baseline or PP condition) predicted each of the
coded categories outlined in Table III using mixed-effects lo-
gistic regression models with participant number as a random
intercept. We included photo number (1-6) and likelihood to
share over-and-above these factors.
The results are shown in Table IV. Notably, participants
in the PP condition were more likely to state that they were
not concerned with the privacy of photo subjects compared
to the baseline condition, Oddsratio = 15.91, B = 2.77,
p = .01. Thus, PP condition participants were over 15 times
more likely to note that they were unconcerned with photo
subject privacy than baseline participants. This effect was not
qualiﬁed by photo; participants demonstrated a lack of concern
about privacy regardless of the photo. In addition, the extent to
which participants reported that they personally related to the
photo was signiﬁcantly lower in the PP condition compared to
the baseline condition, OR = 0.32, B = −1.13, p = .003. For
all other models, the effect of condition was nonsigniﬁcant, ps
> .05.
In sum, these ﬁndings indicate that participants instructed
to attend to the privacy of photo subjects were more likely
to mention not being concerned with others’ privacy when
sharing images via social media, while also reporting less
often that they thought the photos personally related to their
lives. This ﬁnding offers some preliminary insight into why
the privacy condition in Study 2 led to more photo sharing, as
compared to the baseline. In particular, it appears that when
participants are reminded of others’ privacy, they become less
concerned with risking others’ privacy, perhaps because they
feel less personally related to those whose privacy is at risk.
V. DISCUSSION
The principal goal of this research was to assess whether
either of two behavioral interventions would inﬂuence the
likelihood of sharing photos online. Our perspective-taking in-
tervention was designed to make participants consider what it
would be like to be the target of the shared photo. Our privacy
perspective intervention involved increasing the likelihood of
the participant considering the privacy of others. Both of these
interventions were operationalized by leading participants to
explicitly think about one or the other of these perspectives
prior to rating the likelihood of sharing each photo. Based
on the results, it is apparent that these manipulations were
successful in affecting behavior, but they did not modulate
response in the manner expected. Instead of decreasing the
likelihood of sharing photos, both interventions increased the
likelihood of sharing photos (although this difference was only
signiﬁcant at the very positive level for the PT condition).
Although these results were surprising and unexpected,
they were conceptually consistent across multiple studies. The
perspective taking condition in both the pilot and main studies
revealed that participants were more likely rather than less
likely to share images. Similarly, in both the main study and
the follow-up study, the privacy prime resulted in more photo-
sharing and less concern for others’ privacy. Thus, although
seemingly paradoxical, the consistency of the ﬁndings suggests
that they are not easily attributable to sampling error or to
minor variations in experimental design.
A. First-order interpretations for paradoxical ﬁndings
How should we interpret these paradoxical results? One
possibility is suggested by research revealing that individuals’
concerns about privacy are lessened when their perceived
control over personal information is increased [64], [65] or
when they underestimate the risks of sharing [65]. This result
is similar to previous research revealing that people are more
willing to take risks and judge risks as less severe when
they feel in control [65]–[68]. For example, people feel safer
driving than ﬂying presumably because they are more in
control when driving a car. In reality, driving is much more
dangerous then ﬂying because there are risks that cannot be
controlled, such as the behavior of other drivers. The proximal
effects of controlling the car appear to obscure the many
risks that cannot be controlled. Extending this past work
to the present ﬁndings, perhaps adopting a self- or privacy-
perspective increased the sense of control that participants
perceived they had over the privacy of the people appearing
in the photos. This increased perception of control may have
lessened concerns about violating the privacy of others.
As noted above, past research has also shown that drawing
attention to privacy concerns can sometimes backﬁre, causing
more online sharing rather than less [61]. This may occur
because people explicitly reject the values of the primes. For
example, if participants do not value others privacy, but are
reminded of others privacy, this could cause them to share
more rather than less. Alternatvely, prior work in psychology
by Wilson and Schooler [69] suggests that introspection about
one’s judgments can inhibit performance. In the present con-
text, asking people to consider the privacy of others may result
in poorer judgments of privacy, and increase the likelihood of
photo sharing with a privacy reminder. Another possibility for
these seemingly paradoxical effects of a privacy mindset is
reactance, or the tendency for seemingly unnecessary rules
or prompts to elicit the opposite effect as intended [70]. Just
as a forbidden fruit becomes sweeter, so too might being
constantly reminded about privacy concerns make violating
others’ privacy more attractive.

Description and demonstrative quote
Participant noted that they were not concerned with the photo subjects privacy
when considering posting to social media.
“I would post it. If that grandma is willing to wear that shirt in public, I imagine
she wants her photo taken, so I would not worry about the privacy.”
Participant noted that they were concerned with the photo subjects privacy
when considering posting to social media.
“I would not share it because this lady may not even know her photo is within
this meme. I will guess and say the t-shirt quote is photoshopped. It would not
feel right to me to share this with her face being so open.”
Personally
related
Participant noted that they personally related to the photo subject or content.
“It’s the perfect picture to convey how most people feel their lives are going.
It’s a picture almost anyone could relate to.”
Did not person-
ally relate
Participant stated that they did not personally relate to the content of the photo
or it did not apply to them.
“I just don’t see why I would have a motivation to share it. It’s cute, but it’s
not relevant to me, or anyone I know. It would be more random than anything
if I did share it, and no one would understand why I did.”
Funny
Not funny
Participant indicated that they found the photo funny.
“This seems pretty humorous [sic] to me. I wouldn’t not [sic] mind sharing this
with others since most of my friends, family and followers enjoy humorous
content as well. I think others would get a good laugh from this photo.”
Participant noted that the photo was not funny or was not funny enough to
post.
“It’s a lame joke. I don’t like sharing stupid memes. I don’t know why people
think these dumb images with dumb text in ugly fonts are funny. It’s as funny
as a home video which is to say not funny.”
Mentions subject
Participant directly references the person in the photo.
“I feel like it is also a little mean to post this guy on my social media and to
have lots of people see him in an embarrassing situation.”
Did not under-
stand
Participant noted that they did not understand the meaning of the photo or text
paired with the photo.
“To me, the image does not make sense at all.”
