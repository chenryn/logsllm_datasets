### D. Photo Order Effects on Sharing Likelihood

Although the order of photos was randomized for each participant, we examined whether fatigue throughout the experiment influenced the likelihood of photo sharing. Of particular interest was whether participants' photo-sharing decisions changed over the course of the relatively large number of decisions they made in the study. To investigate this, we divided the ratings into four quartiles based on the order in which the photos were presented to each participant. We then conducted a repeated-measures ANOVA to compare the average share scores of the four quartiles, applying a Greenhouse-Geisser adjustment as needed. The results showed that photo order was not significantly associated with the likelihood of sharing (F(2.80, 1056.64) = 2.26, p = 0.08, η² = .006). This finding was consistent when comparing the average likelihood to share for the first ten and last ten photos using a paired-samples t-test (t(378) = 1.49, p = .14). Therefore, we conclude that there were no significant order effects due to fatigue.

### E. Summary of Results

These findings demonstrate a counter-intuitive effect of the experimental manipulation: participants in the privacy condition reported a greater likelihood of sharing photos of others compared to those in the baseline condition. Given our predictions, these findings are clearly paradoxical. Privacy reminders may have the unintended effect of increasing privacy violations.

Additionally, several individual difference factors were associated with the likelihood of photo sharing. First, participants who frequently shared photos on real-world social media platforms were more likely to want to share photos in the experiment, regardless of how the photo portrayed the subject. Second, male participants were more likely to share negatively valenced photos than female participants, although both genders were equally likely to share positively valenced photos. These findings contribute to our understanding of online privacy by identifying social media users who are generally more likely to violate the privacy of others and who may be particularly important target groups for privacy-related interventions.

Among the measures entered into the regression model, social media usage, privacy experiences and preferences, and experimental condition were significant predictors of overall likelihood to share. Specifically, the frequency of photo sharing on real social media platforms and personal privacy rating were most strongly related to sharing likelihood. The correlation between real-world photo sharing and the likelihood of sharing during the experiment suggests that the present study design is a valid way of understanding decisions to share online. The correlation might be even higher if the photos were more representative of real-world photos shared by participants, such as self-relevant images of friends and family. The results also indicate that past photo sharing is the best predictor of future decisions to share. Personal privacy preference was also significantly related to decisions to share photos of other people, suggesting that people who value their own privacy more also value the privacy of others.

### F. Follow-up Study

The central findings of Study 2 were opposite to our hypothesis, revealing that the privacy prime increased rather than decreased photo sharing. To better understand this paradoxical effect, we conducted a follow-up study asking participants to explain their sharing decisions for a subsample of photos from our original study. Past research has shown that drawing attention to privacy concerns can sometimes backfire. For example, Trudeau and colleagues found that when participants were primed to think about privacy, they made "worse" decisions in sharing private information on social media, indicating they were willing to engage in riskier decisions and were less concerned about privacy after being explicitly reminded of it [61]. Thus, perhaps our privacy prime condition actually made perceivers less concerned about others' privacy. To test this, we randomly assigned a new sample of participants to either the Baseline or Privacy condition but had them view only six photos selected from the previous study. Their task was to describe in two to three sentences why they would or would not share them. Of interest was whether participants in the privacy condition would express less concern about others' privacy. If true, reminding participants of a value they do not actually hold (i.e., protecting others' privacy) could ironically lead them to act against it, which would explain our previously observed results.

#### 1) Stimuli and Procedure

One hundred participants were recruited via Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Half of them were randomly assigned to the baseline condition, and the other half to the Privacy Prime (PP) condition. After providing informed consent, participants viewed six photos in random order. The stimuli consisted of the six photos from Study 2 for which participants showed the largest difference in sharing scores between the control and PP conditions. These photos included both negatively and positively valenced photos. The procedure was the same as in Study 2, except that participants were also asked to explain their likelihood to share using at least 200 characters in a text box at the bottom of the screen.

#### 2) Coding Measures

Four coders, unaware of the participants' condition, read their responses and created a coding scheme to capture the main themes present in the participants' written responses (Table III). Codes included: concern for privacy; no concern for privacy; mentioning the person/people in the photo; understanding the meme; personally relating to the photo; not personally relating to the photo; viewing the photo as funny; viewing the photo as not funny; considering the photo inappropriate; and whether sharing the photo reflects positively or negatively on the self. We also coded for nonsensical responses, and found that 13% of the responses had this code. Those responses were removed from subsequent analyses. Participant responses to each photo were coded for the presence or absence of each code. One hundred responses were coded independently by all four coders, after which the four coders refined the coding scheme and reached agreement on all responses by discussion. Two coders then coded each of the remaining responses independently. Inter-rater reliability was measured with Gwet’s AC1 [62], which is reported to be less affected by prevalence and marginal probabilities than Cohen’s Kappa [63]. The mean coding reliability across all seven categories was 0.83, and ranged from 0.72 to 0.95. All coding disagreements were resolved by discussion.

#### 3) Results

Of primary interest was whether privacy concerns were higher or lower in the privacy condition relative to the baseline condition. We examined the extent to which condition (baseline or PP condition) predicted each of the coded categories outlined in Table III using mixed-effects logistic regression models with participant number as a random intercept. We included photo number (1-6) and likelihood to share over-and-above these factors.

The results are shown in Table IV. Notably, participants in the PP condition were more likely to state that they were not concerned with the privacy of photo subjects compared to the baseline condition, with an odds ratio of 15.91, B = 2.77, p = .01. Thus, PP condition participants were over 15 times more likely to note that they were unconcerned with photo subject privacy than baseline participants. This effect was not qualified by the specific photo; participants demonstrated a lack of concern about privacy regardless of the photo. Additionally, the extent to which participants reported that they personally related to the photo was significantly lower in the PP condition compared to the baseline condition, with an odds ratio of 0.32, B = −1.13, p = .003. For all other models, the effect of condition was nonsignificant, ps > .05.

In summary, these findings indicate that participants instructed to attend to the privacy of photo subjects were more likely to mention not being concerned with others' privacy when sharing images via social media, while also reporting less often that they thought the photos personally related to their lives. This finding offers some preliminary insight into why the privacy condition in Study 2 led to more photo sharing compared to the baseline. In particular, it appears that when participants are reminded of others' privacy, they become less concerned with risking others' privacy, perhaps because they feel less personally related to those whose privacy is at risk.

### V. Discussion

The principal goal of this research was to assess whether either of two behavioral interventions would influence the likelihood of sharing photos online. Our perspective-taking intervention was designed to make participants consider what it would be like to be the target of the shared photo. Our privacy perspective intervention involved increasing the likelihood of the participant considering the privacy of others. Both of these interventions were operationalized by leading participants to explicitly think about one or the other of these perspectives prior to rating the likelihood of sharing each photo. Based on the results, it is apparent that these manipulations were successful in affecting behavior, but they did not modulate response in the manner expected. Instead of decreasing the likelihood of sharing photos, both interventions increased the likelihood of sharing photos (although this difference was only significant at the very positive level for the PT condition).

Although these results were surprising and unexpected, they were conceptually consistent across multiple studies. The perspective-taking condition in both the pilot and main studies revealed that participants were more likely rather than less likely to share images. Similarly, in both the main study and the follow-up study, the privacy prime resulted in more photo-sharing and less concern for others' privacy. Thus, although seemingly paradoxical, the consistency of the findings suggests that they are not easily attributable to sampling error or minor variations in experimental design.

#### A. First-order Interpretations for Paradoxical Findings

How should we interpret these paradoxical results? One possibility is suggested by research revealing that individuals' concerns about privacy are lessened when their perceived control over personal information is increased [64], [65] or when they underestimate the risks of sharing [65]. This result is similar to previous research revealing that people are more willing to take risks and judge risks as less severe when they feel in control [65]–[68]. For example, people feel safer driving than flying presumably because they are more in control when driving a car. In reality, driving is much more dangerous than flying because there are risks that cannot be controlled, such as the behavior of other drivers. The proximal effects of controlling the car appear to obscure the many risks that cannot be controlled. Extending this past work to the present findings, perhaps adopting a self- or privacy-perspective increased the sense of control that participants perceived they had over the privacy of the people appearing in the photos. This increased perception of control may have lessened concerns about violating the privacy of others.

As noted above, past research has also shown that drawing attention to privacy concerns can sometimes backfire, causing more online sharing rather than less [61]. This may occur because people explicitly reject the values of the primes. For example, if participants do not value others' privacy but are reminded of others' privacy, this could cause them to share more rather than less. Alternatively, prior work in psychology by Wilson and Schooler [69] suggests that introspection about one's judgments can inhibit performance. In the present context, asking people to consider the privacy of others may result in poorer judgments of privacy and increase the likelihood of photo sharing with a privacy reminder. Another possibility for these seemingly paradoxical effects of a privacy mindset is reactance, or the tendency for seemingly unnecessary rules or prompts to elicit the opposite effect as intended [70]. Just as a forbidden fruit becomes sweeter, so too might being constantly reminded about privacy concerns make violating others' privacy more attractive.
