##### ISSUE TYPE
Feature Idea
##### COMPONENT NAME
shell module and check mode
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.0.1.0
##### CONFIGURATION
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
##### SUMMARY
shell (and probably command) modules have a `creates` parameter. The command
is not run when the target file exists. When a playbook is executed with
`--check` option, the task is skipped even when the target file exists. It is
then difficult to know if the shell command would have been executed in normal
mode.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
have a task using the `shell` module and specify a `creates` file.
    - name: ensure ecdsa key is present
      shell: ssh-keygen -N '' -t ecdsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key creates=/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
run the playbook with `--check` option
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
Any information telling that the target already exists so there is no need to
run the task.
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
    TASK [ensure ecdsa key is present]
    skipping: [your_host]
the task marked is skipped even when the file exists.
