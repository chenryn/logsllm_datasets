User: There is an existing multi-node MySQL database cluster that needs to be migrated to a PostgreSQL database. Please describe the migration scenario and its considerations.
Assistant: Migration solution: 1. Create a PostgreSQL cluster: Install the PostgreSQL database on the target server and create a new database cluster. 2. Export data: Use a MySQL data export tool (such as mysqldump) to export all MySQL database table data to one or more .sql files. 3. Convert data: Use an appropriate data conversion tool (such as PGLoader, or manual conversion) to convert the MySQL database table data into a PostgreSQL-compatible format. 4. Import data: Import the converted data files into the PostgreSQL database cluster to restore all MySQL data. 5. Configuration and testing: Configure the connection between the PostgreSQL server and the application, and perform the necessary tests to ensure that the application will function properly. Notes: 1. Data type conversion: MySQL and PostgreSQL have different data types. When converting data, you need to ensure that the MySql data type is converted to a PostgreSQL compatible data type. 2. Data migration complexity: If the MySQL database modifies data while it is running, some data may be lost during data migration. It is recommended to perform data migration when the MySQL database is not running. 3. Precautions for large table migration: special attention should be paid to the performance and space occupation when migrating large tables, and the strategy of batch migration should be considered. 4. Application connection modification: After migration, the application connection information needs to be modified to adapt to the PostgreSQL database. 5. Testing and verification: After migration, necessary testing and verification is required to ensure that the application can run normally and the data is intact.
