User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to run cron service in cygwin? I have run installed cygwin with openssh, rysnc and cron. I've run cygserver-config and cron-config

cygcheck -c | grep cron
cron                      4.1-65                       OK

cygrunsrv -Q cron
Service             : cron
Current State       : Running
Controls Accepted   : Stop
Command             : /usr/sbin/cron -n


Windows recognized the service in the correct user context.

There are no errors in the windows event, cron or cygserver logs. Many resources on the internet insist to use cron-config instead of cygrunsrv -I cron -p /usr/sbin/cron -a -D or cygrunsrv -I cron -p /usr/sbin/cron --args -n. I tried all three. Every thing appears to have installed correctly with cron-config but cron jobs are not running.
here is an example of my crontab (yes, it is set to run every minute for debuging purposes!)

crontab -l
* * * * * rsync -avz -e "ssh -i /cygdrive/c/users/path/.ssh/id_rsa" foo.bar@ssh-target.com:/var/log/path/ /cygdrive/c/destination/path/ --progress


UPDATE:
looks like cron is now running and making entries in the windows event log. Unfortunately, now I am running into execution and context errors.

Assistant: Inside crontab you should always run commands with full path; for rsync it should be


  /usr/bin/rsync
