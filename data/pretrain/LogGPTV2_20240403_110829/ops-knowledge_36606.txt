**Question: How to Run the Cron Service in Cygwin?**

I have installed Cygwin with OpenSSH, rsync, and cron. I have also run `cygserver-config` and `cron-config`.

To verify the installation, I used the following commands:

```sh
cygcheck -c | grep cron
```

Output:
```
cron                      4.1-65                       OK
```

```sh
cygrunsrv -Q cron
```

Output:
```
Service             : cron
Current State       : Running
Controls Accepted   : Stop
Command             : /usr/sbin/cron -n
```

Windows recognizes the service in the correct user context. There are no errors in the Windows Event Viewer, cron logs, or cygserver logs.

Many online resources recommend using `cron-config` instead of the following commands:

```sh
cygrunsrv -I cron -p /usr/sbin/cron -a -D
```

or

```sh
cygrunsrv -I cron -p /usr/sbin/cron --args -n
```

I tried all three methods. Everything appears to be installed correctly with `cron-config`, but the cron jobs are not running. Here is an example of my crontab (set to run every minute for debugging purposes):

```sh
crontab -l
* * * * * rsync -avz -e "ssh -i /cygdrive/c/users/path/.ssh/id_rsa" foo.bar@ssh-target.com:/var/log/path/ /cygdrive/c/destination/path/ --progress
```

**Update:**
Cron now seems to be running and making entries in the Windows Event Log. However, I am now encountering execution and context errors.

**Solution:**
In the crontab, you should always use the full path for commands. For `rsync`, it should be:

```sh
* * * * * /usr/bin/rsync -avz -e "ssh -i /cygdrive/c/users/path/.ssh/id_rsa" foo.bar@ssh-target.com:/var/log/path/ /cygdrive/c/destination/path/ --progress
```
