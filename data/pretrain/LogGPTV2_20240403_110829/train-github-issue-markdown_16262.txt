I recently upgraded to Python 3.7, and now I encounter the following errors when attempting to run code in Jupyter Notebook or the terminal:

```python
Traceback (most recent call last):

SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

It appears that there is a `SyntaxError` due to the use of `async` as a parameter name, which is a reserved keyword in Python 3.7. This issue may be caused by an incompatibility between the version of TensorFlow you are using and Python 3.7.

To resolve this, you can try one of the following solutions:
1. **Upgrade TensorFlow**: Ensure you have the latest version of TensorFlow, which should be compatible with Python 3.7.
   ```sh
   pip install --upgrade tensorflow
   ```

2. **Downgrade Python**: If upgrading TensorFlow does not solve the issue, you might need to downgrade to a previous version of Python that is known to be compatible with your current TensorFlow version.

3. **Check for Patches**: Look for any community patches or updates that address this specific issue.

Please let me know if you need further assistance with these steps.
