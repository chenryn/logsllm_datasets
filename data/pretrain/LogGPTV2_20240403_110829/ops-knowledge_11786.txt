Assistant: This log chunk is related to various software components and processes running on the system. It begins with Safari's KeychainGetICDPStatus being set to off, followed by QQ's VoipWrapper closing a video chat. The kernel then reports an unplug of a Thunderbolt HPC packet, followed by a path not being allowed in the target domain. The log then reports a notification observer for FaceTime, a setting of BTCoex Config, CCIOReporterFormatter adding registry child to channel dictionary, a capture event, a skipping of a file, a hashing of a primary key failing, CCProfileMonitor freeing resources, a copy file, AppleCamIn's systemWakeCall, a failed connection to a network, NC and DND being disabled and enabled, an error returned from iconservicesagent, CGXDisplayDidWakeNotification posting, and another DND enabled.
