User: Server.Transfer is sort of like a Redirect except instead of requesting the browser to do another page fetch, it triggers an internal request that makes the request handler "go to" another request handler.
Is there a Python equivalent to this in Google App Engine?

Assistant: Usually, you just have to call the corresponding method.
For being more specific... Which flavour of AppEngine are you using? Java, Python, Go... Php?
