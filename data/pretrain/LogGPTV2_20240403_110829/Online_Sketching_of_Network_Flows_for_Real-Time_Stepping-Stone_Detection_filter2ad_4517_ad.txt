(i.e. TCP packets and their ACK’s), they are not part of a
stepping stone attack.
• Too Short Flows: A successful stepping-stone attack is
expected to last long enough to allow the attacker exchange
sufﬁcient information with the victim over an interactive
protocol. Hence, too short ﬂows are highly unlikely to be
a part of a stepping-stone attack and therefore excluded in
the comparison process. To identify short ﬂows, we used the
number of time-slots in which the ﬂow was active, such that,
we excluded a ﬂow in the search process if it was active in
less than 20 time-slots.
• Flows With Insufﬁcient Packet-Timing Information:
In some cases, a ﬂow might have no distinctive packet-
timing information, such as when downloading a ﬁle or
streaming a video etc. Usually such ﬂows all have constant
number of packets at each time-slot and therefore appear
to be correlated with each other. Hence, such ﬂows should
be excluded in the search process and treated separately.
To detect such ﬂows in real-time, we simply checked the
fraction of the time-slots in which a ﬂow is active during
its lifetime. We observed that, most of the ﬂows having

insufﬁcient packet-timing information were active more than
90% of the time-slots.
Detection Rate Results: In our experiments, we computed
the detection rate of the proposed scheme under various
maxDelay and chaﬀRate. Figure 5 plots these measured
detection rates, where we used 500 millisecond long time-
slots and 512-bit sketches. The duration of the correlated
ﬂows were 60 seconds. It is observed that the proposed
scheme resists delays and chaff packets to some extent.
For instance, the algorithm detected 95% of the correlated
ﬂow pairs when the maxDelay = 100 milliseconds and
chaﬀRate = 0.1. However, further increasing chaff rates
and delays decreases the detection rate, as expected since,
the packet-count vectors of correlated ﬂows deviate from
each other as chaff rate and max delay increase.
Effect of Time-Slot Length: Time-slot length is an im-
portant parameter, which sets a trade-off between resistance
to delays and ability to distinguish between uncorrelated
ﬂows. If the time-slot length was set too short, then even
very slight packet delays would result in packets drifting
into subsequent time-slots. As a result, packet-count vectors,
and therefore ﬂow sketches, would change drastically even
under a slight packet delays. On the other hand, making the
time-slots too long would result in the packet-count vectors
of some uncorrelated ﬂows being similar to each other. Our
experiments suggest that, 500 millisecond long time-slots
are an appropriate choice for our setting. Figures 5 and 6(a)
depict that, using shorter time-slots (i.e. 300 milliseconds)
weakens the resistance to the packet delays since detection
rate is observed to decrease more rapidly for increased
maxDelay in Figrue 6(a) than in Figure 5. On the other
hand, using longer time-slots i.e. 1000 milliseconds) makes
the sketches of uncorrelated ﬂows similar to each other. As a
result, the 10−4 false alarm rate threshold becomes smaller
and therefore the detection performance decreases again, as
observed in Figure 6(b).
Effect of Sketch Length: Using short sketches is very
important for the proposed scheme to be scalable. However,
using too short sketches makes it harder to distinguish
between correlated and uncorrelated ﬂows. The reason is
that, shorter sketches contains less information about the
packet-timings of ﬂows, thereby yielding increased proba-
bility of the sketches of two uncorrelated ﬂows being similar
to each other. More formally, when shorter sketches are
used, the distribution of the Hamming Distances between the
binary sketches of uncorrelated ﬂows (Figure 4) will have
higher variance, thereby pushing the 10−4 false alarm rate
threshold towards zero and hence decreasing the detection
performance. The improvement of the detection rate with the
increased sketch length is observed in Figures 7(a), 5 and
7(b), where we used 256-bit, 512-bit and 1024-bit sketches,
respectively.
Effect of Correlated Flows’ Duration: It is expected that,
the detection rate increases as the duration of the correlated
ﬂows increases. That is because, longer ﬂows have more
packets and therefore their linear transform coefﬁcients have
higher magnitudes. As a result, same amount of distortion
on packet-count vectors has less impact on the integer-array
sketches of longer ﬂows, as discussed in Section III-A5.
Hence, sketches of longer ﬂows are more resistant to timing
perturbations. This can be observed in Figures 8(a), 5 and
8(b), where we present the detection rates for correlated ﬂow
durations 30, 60 and 90 seconds, respectively. Consequently
one can say that, the longer an attacker stays on-line, the
more likely the proposed scheme detects her attack.
V. LIMITATIONS AND POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS
High Chaff Rates: Although, stepping-stone attacks are
constrained by a maximum tolerable delay, in theory there
is no such constraint on chaff. That is, an attacker can
introduce as many chaff packets as she would like (as
long as the network is able to handle) in order to disrupt
the observed correlation between her ﬂows. However, in
most cases, sending packets at an unusually high-rate might
expose the attack instead of concealing it. Nevertheless,
such cases are potential problems, not only for the proposed
scheme but for all timing-based ﬂow correlation schemes
(i.e. link padding algorithms in the context of anonymity
networks [13][14][15]). To mitigate such cases, one needs
to identify ﬂows with unusually high packet-rates and treat
them separately. If these cases are relatively rare, one can
afford to employ very complex algorithms to process them.
One possible solution is that, ﬂows with unusually high
packet-rates can be tested by an active ﬂow correlation
scheme [16] [17][18], which marks an ingress ﬂow by
perturbing packet timings in a certain manner, and checks if
any of the egress ﬂows contain the embedded mark.
Flow Splitting/Merging: To evade detection, an attacker
might employ more complex strategies, such as ﬂow splitting
or ﬂow merging. In ﬂow splitting, an attacker creates multi-
ple egress ﬂows sharing outgoing attack packets, instead of
using only one egress ﬂow. Or similarly, in ﬂow merging, an
