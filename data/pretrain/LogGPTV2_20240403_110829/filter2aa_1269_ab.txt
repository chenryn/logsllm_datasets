and crafted signals, i.e., jamming and spooﬁng attacks in
their physical channels.
I. Resistance to noise (Jamming Attack)
The sensors are designed to resist environmental noise,
which exists in normal working conditions.
For example,
there may occur acoustical interference from other objects
near the vehicle, in particular the noise of compressed air
(e.g., truck brakes) and metallic friction noise from track ve-
hicles [21]. However, their ability to resist intentional noise
or loud noise has not been published. The injected noise will
very likely lower the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and make
the detection impossible.
II. Resistance to malicious physical channel injec-
tion (Spooﬁng Attack)
Receiving genuine physical signals from the wrong source
can happen when sensors are wrongly positioned, e.g., facing
each other.
By analogy, if malicious injected signals are
made to emulate physical patterns of the real ones, it is
possible for them to be taken as real measurements, so as to
disrupt sensor readings. If the crafted signal can be further
controlled, the readings could possibly be manipulated.

Research Steps
To examine the security of vehicular sensors, we basically
went through the following steps.
1. Taking stand-alone sensors for laboratory experiments.
2. Studying the sensors by any means.
3. Performing jamming and spooﬁng attacks.
4. Testing the attacks on vehicles.
5. Testing the attacks on automated driving system.
6. Improving and looking for new attack methods.
Potential attack surfaces including sensors in autonomous
automated vehicle has been discussed in [19], but most of
them have not been examined or validated by experiments or
on vehicles. In the coming sections, experimental attacks on
ultrasonic sensors, MMW radars, and forward-facing cam-
eras are illustrated and discussed in details.

ATTACKING ULTRASONIC SENSORS
Ultrasonic-based parking assistance system was ﬁrst in-
troduced in the European market in the early 1990s. This
system monitors the front and rear of the vehicle, and warn
the driver if there are obstacles in the vicinity of the vehicle
that can cause collisions. Power functionalities like semiau-
tomatic parking assistance, fully automatic parking, parking
space detection, and Tesla’s new summon feature (parking
with driver outside the vehicle) [27] have been realized based
on the same sensor technology. Ultrasonic sensors can help
to have an eye on the invisible parking space and to park
the vehicle easily, quickly, and safely [11].
Besides automotive application, ultrasonic sensors are also
used in many other ﬁelds since long, such as in military for
submarines, in medicine for diagnostics, in materials for test-
ing, and in industry and robot technology for distance mea-
surement [2][13][29]. We believe studies on the security of
ultrasonic sensors can shed light rather than on automotive
itself.
In this section, fundamentals of ultrasonic sensors are to
be ﬁrst introduced as the background of our attack, then we
present our attack methods and results acquired in the lab
and outdoors.
By making a DIY ultrasonic jammer with
a low-cost Arduino, we managed to launch jamming and
spooﬁng attacks on ultrasonic sensors, and tested on sev-
eral popular car models, including a Tesla Model S. We will
demonstrate the following:
• Jamming attack can make objects undetectable so
as to cause collisions, or force the car to stop while
performing self-parking.
Figure 2: Appearance and cross-section of an ultra-
sonic sensor from Bosch.
• Spooﬁng attack can manipulate the sensor readings,
and lead to the display of pseudo-obstacles.
• Acoustic cancellation is possible, but dedicated hard-
ware and algorithms are required.
5.1
System Model
The distance measurements using ultrasonic sensors ac-
cording to the pulse/echo principle are very straightforward
from the technical viewpoint because of the comparably low
speed of sound. Ultrasonic sensors detect objects by emit-
ting ultrasonic pulses, and measure the time taken for the
echo pulses to be reﬂected back from obstacles.
The dis-
tance to the nearest obstacle is calculated from the propa-
gation time (time-of-ﬂight, TOF) of the ﬁrst echo pulse to
be received back according to the equation
d = 0.5 · te · c
(1)
with te: propagation time of ultrasonic echoes, c: velocity
of sound in air (approximately 340 m/s). A method called
trilateration is further used to calculate the real distance to
the vehicle from the direct readings of neighboring sensors.
Components. The sensor consists of a plastic housing
with integrated plug-in connection, an ultrasonic transducer,
and a printed circuit board with the electronic circuitry to
transmit, receive, and evaluate the signals, see Figure 2.
Piezoelectric E↵ect. The acoustic part of an ultrasonic
sensor is the transducer. Same as transducers in the hearing
range (better known as microphones and speakers), ultra-
sonic transducers are build on the piezoelectric e↵ect [17].
The piezoelectric e↵ect describes the electromechanical con-
text between the electric and the mechanic status of a crys-
tal. If a voltage is applied at the electrodes on two sides of a
piezoelectric crystal, a mechanical deformation results and
generates acoustic wave. Vice versa, an incoming acoustic
wave creates oscillations of the crystal. As a consequence,
an alternating voltage is generated at the electrodes which
can be ampliﬁed and further processed.
Mechanisms. When the sensor receives a digital trans-
mit signal from the ECU, the circuit excites the membrane
with square waves (approx. 300 µs) at its resonance fre-
quency (40 – 50 kHz), so it vibrates and emits ultrasound.
No reception is possible during the time taken for it to stop
oscillating (approx. 700 µs), which is also known as the ring-
down problem. Once rested, the membrane can be made to
vibrate again by the echo reﬂected back from the obstacles.
These vibrations are converted by the piezoelectric crystal
to an analog signal, which is then ampliﬁed, ﬁltered, digi-
tized, and compared to a threshold to determine the echo’s
arrival. The time-of-ﬂight diagram is ﬁnally transmitted to
the ECU for further distance calculation.
Frequency.
For ultrasonic transducers in automotive
parking aid systems, an operating frequency between 40 and
50 kHz is commonly used. This has been proved as the best
compromise between good acoustical performance (sensitiv-
ity and range) and high robustness against noise from the
surrounding of the transducer. Higher frequencies lead to
lower echo amplitudes because of higher dampening of the
airborne sound, whereas for lower frequencies the proportion
of interfering sound in the vehicle environment is always in-
creasing [18].
Based on the above knowledge, we design an attack sys-
tem which can generate ultrasound in the same frequencies
as automotive sensors, and can craft ultrasound pulses to
emulate sensors’ working patterns.
We then launch jam-
ming and spooﬁng attacks in observation of sensor reactions
and vehicular system reactions.
5.2
Jamming Attack
Jamming attack aims to generate ultrasonic noises and
cause continuing vibration of the membrane on the sensor,
which make the measurements impossible. Failing to detect
obstacles can lead to collisions in parking or maneuvering.
5.2.1
Inherent Vulnerabilities
Ultrasonic sensors are known to have weakened perfor-
mance in two scenarios [18]. On the one hand strong extra-
neous acoustic emitters in the region of ultrasonic working
frequency in the immediate vicinity of a vehicle can lower the
signal-to-noise ratio such that measurements are no longer
possible. In practice, noise sources are above all compressed
air noises (e.g., air brakes in trucks) and metallic grating
noises, (e.g., from railed vehicles). On the other hand, any
layers of dirt, snow, or ice on the sensor diaphragms can
form a sound bridge with the bumper that can prolong the
decay behavior of transmission excitation in an undeﬁned
manner.
These inherent vulnerabilities indicate the feasibility of
performing physical attacks on ultrasonic sensors. To simu-
late the extraneous noise source, ultrasonic transducers will
be a good choice that can exhibit higher sound pressure level
and better frequency performance as well as controllability
than truck air brakes or metal key chains.
On the other
hand, specially made sound absorbing masks can be adhered
to the surface to prevent transmission, but it is against our
threat model by physical alteration and contact.
5.2.2
Description
Jamming attack is built on a very straightforward idea —
continuously emitting ultrasound at the sensor to lower its
Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), as shown in Figure 5.
Our
major considerations are listed as follows.
Resonant Frequency.
Ultrasonic sensors for parking
assistance generally operate on frequencies between 40 kHz
and 50 kHz. From our observation on several car models,
this frequency appears to be near 50 kHz. Ultrasonic trans-
ducers are manufactured with a ﬁxed resonant frequency
which is determined by the diameter of the piezoceramics.
Within several kHz around the resonant frequency like a
bandpass ﬁlter, the transducer exhibits the best emittance

Model S. A is the jammer, B is 3 ultrasonic sensors
on the left side.
and sensitivity. Thus it would be best to choose jamming
transducers in the same frequency band as of the sensors,
which in our case is 50 kHz. Unfortunately 50 kHz trans-
ducers were not available on the market, so we used the
popular 40 kHz transducers, which turned out to have pass-
able performance.
Emitting Ultrasound. Piezoelectric e↵ect describes the
generation of acoustic wave by applying alternating voltage.
Moreover, the frequency of the AC signal determines the
oscillation frequency, and hence the frequency of generated
acoustic wave. By applying 40 kHz square wave to the trans-
ducer, we are able to generate ultrasound of 40 kHz. This
principle works for other frequencies with compatible hard-
ware, as well as for microphones and speakers.
Equipment. To generate controllable square wave of 40
kHz, we ﬁnd Arduino Uno board [1] competent as a low-
cost, o↵-the-shelf hardware. It can output square wave of
speciﬁed frequency on the digital I/O pins with a built-in
function called Tone(), which is mainly used for generating
tones on speakers. There is observable frequency jitter at
40 kHz and higher, though the jamming performance does
not seem to be a↵ected. To achieve accurate frequencies for
phase-sensitive attacks like acoustic cancellation, dedicated
hardware is recommended.
Voltage Level. Sound pressure level relies on the volt-
age level in piezoelectric e↵ect, and vice versa. To acquire
farther attack distance, higher voltage has to be applied in
order for acceptable sound pressure level at the targeted sen-
sor after airborne attenuation. Arduino outputs at 5 volts,
which works well within a very limited range. In some cases,
we used a function generator to achieve higher frequency
precision and voltage level. One can consider designing his
own piece of equipment to fulﬁl such attacks.
5.2.3
Results
We have tested jamming attack on many ultrasonic sen-
sors indoors and outdoors on real cars with parking assis-
tance. We further tested on Tesla Model S’s self parking and
summon function. All the experiments are carried out with
the setup that an obstacle always exists and can be detected
by the sensor when no attacks are going.
On Ultrasonic Sensors. We have tested on 8 di↵erent
ultrasonic sensors/systems in the laboratory. Six of them
(a) Normal.
(b) Spoofed.
(c) Jammed.

are individual ultrasonic ranging modules, one of them is an
aftermarket vehicular sensor, and the other is an OEM park-
ing assistance system consisting of one ECU unit and four
sensors. We have observed two very opposite kinds of sensor
output under jamming attacks, one is ZERO distance, while
the other is MAXIMUM distance. Zero distance means the
detection of something very close that nearly touches; max-
imum distance indicates the detection of nothing. We think
the opposite results are due to di↵erent sensor designs. For
the ﬁrst kind, a ﬁxed threshold is set for the detection of
returning echoes. Our jamming signal always exceeds the
threshold, and will be falsely recognised as an returning echo
as soon as receiving mode is made possible, so the readings
under jamming will be zero.
Another kind of design im-
plements ﬂexible threshold to eliminate noise. Our jamming
signal is recognised as noise because it exists throughout the
whole cycle, and hence lowers the SNR. No measurements
are possible, so the readings will be maximum consequently.
On Cars with Parking Assistance.
Four cars with
driver assistance system have been tested. They are popular
models from Audi, Volkswagen, Tesla, and Ford. Systems
on these cars di↵er with each other, but they all inform the
driver about obstacles by either acoustic or visual distance
information. As shown in Figure 3, the ultrasonic jammer is
placed in front of the bumper, and can be correctly detected
when idle. When jamming attack is launched, the obstacle
can no longer be detected by the vehicle, therefore no alarm
is given to the driver (Figure 4(c)). This can be considered
as the maximum distance case in above sensor test, and the
reasons similar. We further tested when the cars are moving
in reverse gear, and results are the same. Jammer-sensor
distance for e↵ective attack have been measured to be as
long as 10 meters for Tesla. Failing to detect obstacles can
lead to collisions, the consequence of which could be vital
when pedestrians are hit.
On Tesla Model S with Automatic Parking. We fur-
ther tested on the self parking and summon feature of Tesla
Model S. If jamming attack can also cause false negative to
automatic parking system, the aftermath will be worse in
this case without human supervision. To our surprise, Tesla
seems to have switched to another algorithm for handling
sensor readings at automatic parking, and it would stop at
once as soon as we launched jamming. Neglect of obstacles
are only possible when the jammer are aimed at the sen-
sor deliberately, and the jammer-sensor distance is greatly
reduced.
2This is a strange display of tire pressure. It pops out every
time we do ultrasonic jamming, and disappears once we stop.
Anyway, NO distance information can be displayed during
jamming.

up to down are original signal, spooﬁng signal, jam-
ming signal, and acoustic cancellation signal.

5.3
Spooﬁng Attack
Spooﬁng attack shares the same physical channel and hard-
ware with jamming attack, but it is more carefully crafted
with the purpose of deceiving the sensors. This attack can
lead to disturbance or manipulation of the sensor readings,
which will lead to more controllable collisions, or just fool
the driver/autonomous car.
5.3.1
Description
Spooﬁng attack is based on the assumption that if care-
fully crafted ultrasound pulses from adversaries can be rec-
ognized as echoes from obstacles, and arrive at the sensor
ahead of the real ones, then the sensor readings will devi-
ate from the real one. By adjusting the timing of carefully
crafted pulses, an attacker can manipulate sensor readings,
i.e., distance measurement. An illustration is shown in Fig-
ure 5.
Setup. The setup is similar to jamming attack, except
that the transducer is excited with 50 kHz square wave,
which exhibits better performance than 40 kHz.
Pattern. To spoof the sensor, an emulation of its phys-
ical pattern (300 µs excitation and 700 µs ring down) is
reasonable, though not necessary. An excitation time of 200
– 300 µs normally works well, but we do not recommend
more than 1 ms.
Diﬃculty.
Timing is a trick for spooﬁng attack.
Un-
like LiDAR, ultrasonic sensors only care about the nearest
obstacles. This means only the ﬁrst justiﬁable echo will be
processed, other echoes in the following will be totally ig-
nored. Thus the counterfeit echo have to be ahead of the
real ones in order to be e↵ective, which means the spoofed
measurement can only be subtractive. Here we deﬁne the
Attack Slot for spooﬁng attack, which is the time slot be-
tween the end of transmitted pulse and start of ﬁrst echo.
Our injection must reside within the attack slot, the length
