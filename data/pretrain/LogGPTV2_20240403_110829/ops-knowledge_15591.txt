Question: An attacker is attempting to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in a program that implements stack canaries. Which of the following methods could the attacker use to potentially subvert the stack canary protection? (Select all that apply)
"A": "Exploiting format string vulnerabilities to overwrite the return instruction pointer (rip) without altering the canary.",
"B": "Running the program multiple times to brute force guess the canary's value on a 32-bit architecture.",
"C": "Using an unrelated vulnerability to leak the canary value and reuse it in the overflow exploit.",
"D": "Injecting a large amount of data to overflow the stack canary and crash the program, thus bypassing the canary."
Answer: ABC
