User: According to the following application performance problems, adjust the server configuration and test to ensure that the problem has been solved. A company's application responds slowly under high concurrency conditions, resulting in a poor user experience. Through monitoring, it is found that the CPU utilization rate of the application server has reached more than 90%, and the memory usage rate is also high.
Assistant: 1. Increase server performance - Increase CPU: replace with a higher speed CPU or increase the number of CPUs - Increase memory: increase the amount of available memory so that more applications can run on the server - Replace hard disk: replace with a faster hard disk, To improve read and write speed 2. Adjust application configuration - Adjust load balancer settings: increase the number of servers to avoid excessive load on the same server. - Adjust thread pool settings: Increase the number of threads to avoid slow response due to insufficient threads. - Code optimization: Remove duplicate code, upgrade the framework or introduce more efficient algorithms to improve application efficiency. 3. Conduct stress testing - Use stress testing tools to simulate application running under high concurrency conditions to simulate real usage scenarios. - Monitor application performance, especially response time, CPU and memory usage, to assess the impact of tuning. - Continue to optimize based on test results until performance issues are resolved.
