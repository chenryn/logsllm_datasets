User: Provide a reasonable and feasible IT infrastructure design plan, including network, server, storage, security and other aspects.
Assistant: Infrastructure scheme design 1. Network architecture design (1) Network structure-hierarchical structure In this design mode, the network is divided into three layers: boundary layer, aggregation layer and core layer. Each layer has its own characteristics, which can better meet the needs of the enterprise internal network. - Boundary layer: Responsible for providing network connections to the outside and communicating with other networks such as the Internet. This layer needs to set up security devices such as firewalls to ensure the security of the network. - Aggregation layer: Various distributed networks are connected through aggregation devices or protocols, and traffic is concentrated to the core layer. Devices at this layer are network devices such as switches and are responsible for managing data traffic. - Core layer: handles a large amount of data flow, ensures communication speed and reliability, and ensures high availability of the network, etc. (2) Network architecture - multi-level structure inherits the hierarchical design idea. The multi-level network architecture is different from the single-level structure. The network is divided into multiple different areas, and each area has its own network. These areas are connected to form a complete network structure. - Data Center/Cloud: Responsible for handling various computing jobs and data storage. - Business application layer: Responsible for providing business application services to various departments or customers. - Boundary layer: Responsible for connecting the Internet and external networks, and ensuring network security. (3) Network architecture - flexible segmented architecture The flexible distributed network design mode can flexibly allocate network resources according to actual work requirements. Distributed technology can be used to distribute databases, web applications, file resources, etc. on different nodes, and load balancing technology can be used to improve the capabilities and performance of distributed networks. 2. Server Architecture Design - Server Type - Physical Server/Virtual Server Virtualization technology is a more and better technical solution in recent years. The use of virtual machines can better allocate system resources according to actual needs, and can be isolated and safer, save hardware costs, facilitate operation and management, and can be flexibly used within the entire enterprise. - The number and scale of servers are equipped with computing power according to the actual workload, number of users, data storage and other requirements. - Operating system selection According to actual needs, select a standardized operating system, such as Windows Server, Linux, to seamlessly connect with various internal modules of the enterprise. 3. Design of storage architecture Distributed file system technology can achieve the distributed architecture of the company's internal data storage, and use the storage server to store data according to certain rules to form a whole to achieve the purpose of backup, recovery, and fast data access. - Storage scale and technical requirements Select storage scale and technical requirements according to actual needs, such as RAID, NAS, etc. - Storage backup and recovery strategy According to the cost performance, select a certain data backup solution, realize fast data backup and recovery on a regular basis, and ensure the security of system data. 4. Security architecture design evaluates risks and adopts a series of security strategies to prevent them, including: - Network security strategy - Server security strategy - Data storage and backup strategy - Authentication and access control strategy At the same time, improving the construction of IT infrastructure can help enterprises achieve networking, intelligence, high efficiency and security to achieve enterprise goals. Moreover, in the process of infrastructure design and construction, we need to constantly sum up experience and keep up with technology at any time to maintain the maintainability and scalability of the infrastructure.
