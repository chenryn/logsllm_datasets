User: Well, altough the S of the SNMP stands for Simple, yet, so far I haven't experienced it that way. And now that I am about to deploy my software on around around 180 remote Linux servers and wants to monitor the servers and configure my daemons all from a centralized point.
I simply want you to recommend me the library which you'll confidently describe as "SNMP Made Easy".
I am looking for a suite of software which not standing in the developer's way, easy to work with (install, configure).
Speaking from the NOC perspective, the ideal would be such one which requires no maintenance once installed.
Note: Open Source is mandatory.
Assistant: The "S" in SNMP is actually for "simple" not because using it is simple, but rather because the protocol (on the wire) is designed to be simple and easy to implement.  And it is.  Now...  actually implementing it and then using it is where the S completely drops away.
