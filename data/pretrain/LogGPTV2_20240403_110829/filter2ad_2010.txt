to those problems. The program for the workshop contains 12 full
papers and 3 short papers selected from a total of 34 submissions.
Specific topics covered in the program include but are not limited
to: communication privacy, data anonymization, differential pri-
vacy, medical privacy, mobile privacy, privacy engineering, privacy

1 INTRODUCTION
The Information Revolution has thoroughly transformed society.
One of the major implications of this technological shift has been a
massive increase in the collection, sharing, and analysis of personal
data. The goal of this workshop is to discuss the privacy problems
that result as well as their solutions. This will be the 19th occurrence
of this annual forum, which is held in conjunction with the ACM
CCS conference.
The workshop seeks submissions from academia, government,
and industry presenting novel research on all theoretical and prac-
tical aspects of electronic privacy, as well as experimental studies
of fielded systems, and systematization of knowledge (SoK) submis-
sions. We encourage submissions from other communities such as
law and business that present these communities’ perspectives on
technological issues. Topics of interest for WPES include, but are
not limited to:
