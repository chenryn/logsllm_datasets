Table 3: Classification accuracy of our approach for a three large mobile operators. Count is the classification accuracy for
individual CIDRs, Demand is the classification accuracy weighted by each CIDR’s traffic demand. ∗Mixed operator.
For the remainder of this paper, we set a threshold of 0.5 to denote
cellular subnets. We acknowledge that this is a rather conservative
threshold given our sensitivity analysis, but we wished to balance
the demand curve from Figure 2, which shows low demand below
cellular ratios lower than 0.5, and to cover as much cellular demand
as possible while minimizing false positives. We believe a simple
“majority” label matches these goals.
Validation. We now report on the accuracy of our approach
and chosen threshold for cellular network identification. Table 3
reports this accuracy for the three mobile operators, showing the
classification category (i.e. TP, FP, ...) and the Precision and Recall
of our approach. Rows labeled with CIDR show the classification
accuracy for all active subnets within that operator, and those
labeled with Demand show the accuracy when weighting CIDRs
by their relative traffic demand.
For all the operators, our method produced very high precision,
meaning a low false positive rate, for both total CIDRs and the
weighted subnet demand. The table highlights the method’s high
accuracy of classification, showing a precision greater than 0.97
in all instances. This means that for the three operators tested,
upwards of 97% of subnets were correctly labeled as cellular. The
table also shows that our method misses many no- or low-active
cellular subnets, as shown by the large number of false negatives
overall. In the case of Carrier A, our approach mislabeled 4,626
cellular subnets as fixed-line subnets. In this way, our approach
yields a lower bound on the number of detected cellular subnets,
but with a very high confidence in those cellular subnets detected.
4.3 Identifying Cellular Subnets
Applying this methodology to our BEACON dataset, we find a
total of 350,687 /24 subnets and 23,230 /48 cellular subnets. South
America holds the largest numbers of cellular /24 subnets with
87,589 subnets, closely followed by Asia with 86,618 subnets. North
America has only 27,595 /24 subnets despite being one of the largest
markets for cellular services.
We find IPv6 deployment within cellular networks to lag signifi-
cantly behind IPv4. Only 23,230 /48 subnets were detected world
wide, and only North America shows substantial deployment of
IPv6 addresses. The identified deployment of IPv6 in North Amer-
ican networks corroborates recent findings by Plonka et al. [30]
identifying U.S. mobile carriers as some of the largest IPv6 adopters.
Looking at the fraction of addresses that are cellular, we find
7.3% of all active IPv4 /24 prefixes, and 1.2% of IPv6 /48 prefixes to
be cellular. We find a wide range in both the numbers and fractions

of the IP addresses that are cellular across continents. In Africa and
South America, for instance, 53.2% and 22.6% respectively of all /24
subnets detected are cellular. This is in clear contrast to the fraction
of cellular subnets found in the remaining continents, which range
between 5.7% in Asia to 2.1% in North America. We similarly find a
lower relative deployment of IPv6 in cellular networks, again with
North America being the exception with nearly 10% of active /48
subnets coming through cellular subnets.
Despite the reported benefits of IPv6 in mobile networks, such
as improved performance [14], we find IPv6 deployment to be
limited across global cellular networks (only 7.7% of operators). In
our dataset, we found only 52 of the 668 global networks (7.7%)
which support IPv6. Geographically these were found in only 24
countries, with the countries with the greatest numbers of IPv6
networks being Brazil, with 6, and Myanmar, the U.S. and Japan
with 5 each. Of those networks, those with the largest numbers of
discovered subnet (three out of top four ASes) were in the U.S., and
the remaining network in India.
5 CELLULAR AS IDENTIFICATION
In the previous section we applied our methodology to identify
cellular network subnets. In the following paragraphs we extend
our approach to label ASes. This information is valuable to a variety
of services such as content providers and delivery networks, for
tasks such as performance debugging, transport customization and
the management of performance SLA for their customers, among
others.
Using our methodology for subnet identification, a straw-man
approach for labeling cellular ASes is to tag any network with 1 or
more cellular /24 or /48 subnets as cellular. Using such an approach,
we find 1,263 (out of 46,936) ASes that fit this category. A cursory

investigation of the tagged ASes, however, reveals several networks
that are obviously not cellular, such as those offering proxy services.
Looking at our initially labeled set, we see that most of the
miss-labeled ASes are cloud infrastructure hosting companies or
companies offering proxy services for cellular users. Proxy net-
works for cellular connections are services that reroute traffic from
mobile devices, such as performance enhancing proxies for mo-
bile browsers [4]. For example, two of the ASes listed were for
Google (AS 15169) and Opera Software (AS 21837), both of which
operate performance enhancing proxies for their mobile browsers:
Chrome Mobile [4] and Opera Mini [28]. Reverse DNS entries for
the proxy cellular addresses corroborate this, having entries such
as google-proxy-*.google.com for Google’s proxy service, and
*.opera-mini.net for Opera’s proxy service. Other common ex-
amples include the networks of cloud infrastructure companies,
Amazon Web Services or Digital Ocean. We believe these are used
to forward traffic from mobile devices for either proxy or VPN
services specializing in mobile connectivity [21].
The occurrence of these networks are a product of our data
collection approach, which records client IP addresses from the
reported analytics beacon data. A connection terminating proxy –
which most web accelerating proxies are – will forward the client
request through a new HTTP request originating within the proxy’s
network, yet the connection information contained within the bea-
con will report the cellular connection actually experienced by the
client. A similar problem is experienced by VPN services used by
mobile clients, since their external IP addresses are representative
of the VPN service. In the following paragraphs we describe several
heuristics for refining the preliminary list of cellular-tagged ASes.
5.1 Determining Cellular ASes
To filter out the aforementioned false positives (i.e., from cloud
and proxy services) we rely on a set of heuristics. The input to
these heuristics is the collection of ASes with one or more detected
cellular subnet. The followings paragraphs provides details on such
heuristics and their application to the BEACON dataset.
1: Exclude ASes with low cell subnets’ demand. From the input
set of potential cellular ASes, we find that a large fraction of them
have small amounts of overall cellular demand. Figure 4a displays
the distribution of demand from each of these 1,263 ASes, showing
that 40% of such ASes represent more than 6 orders of magnitude
less demand than the largest cellular ASes. We opted for excluding
ASes which have a total cellular demand less than 0.1 DU, removing

493 ASes and leaving 770 ASes. We exclude these low demand ASes
as their demand may suggest false-positive cases in our detection
methodology, without impacting our planned analysis.
2: Exclude ASes with low beacon responses. We further exclude
from this set those with less than 300 beacon responses. The selected
ASes fall in the bottom 5th percentile of all ASes with respect
to demand. This excludes an additional 53 networks leaving 717
remaining.
3: Exclude non-access ASes. We utilize CAIDA’s AS classifica-
tions [1] which labels ASes as either Enterprise, Content or Tran-
sit/Access. We filter out all ASes which are labeled at Content or had
no known class. This filtering removes the remaining non-access
networks such as networks hosting performance enhancing proxy
services which exhibit large amounts of “cellular” demand. From
the previous set of 717 networks, AS-class filtering reduces this to
668 detected cellular ASes.
Table 5 presents a summary of the application of these heuristics
to the BEACON dataset. From the 1,263 ASes in the full dataset (out
of 49,936 total) with one ore more cellular CIDRs, we exclude 595
(≈47%) in total, after applying all heuristics. In the remainder of
this paper, our results and analysis refer to these 668 ASes as the
set of active cellular ASes.

Table 6: Detected cellular ASes by continent.
We summarize the locations, at the continental level, of the re-
maining 668 ASes in Table 6. We find different numbers of detected
cellular ASes per continent, ranging from the 16 in Oceania to the
213 in Asia, although the average per country in each continent
show similar patterns with between 2 to 4.5 cellular ASes per coun-
try (for this calculation, we only include countries with at least one
detected cellular AS). Note that these are averages, and countries
with the largest numbers of cellular ASes in their continent greatly
exceed those averages (e.g., 13 in India, 17 in Japan, 25 in China, 29
in Russia and 40 in the U.S).
6 THE SHAPE OF CELL NETWORKS
In this section we explore different features of the 668 identified
cellular ASes, including their access technology composition, and
their demand at the subnet and operator level. We close with a

fractions (CFD) greater than 0.99, and that 29 of the 32 (90%) have
fractions greater than 0.95. The lowest fraction of cellular demand
in a dedicated operator was 0.9, which we found in an Asian cel-
lular operator. Upon further investigation into why the cellular
fraction was so low within a dedicated operator, we found nearly
all non-cellular demand contained within two /24 subnets which
we believe host HTTP proxies. Each subnet contained substantial
platform demand – large numbers of HTTP requests – but almost
zero hits in our BEACON dataset – which requires Javascript. We
concluded that since no client browsers were active within these
subnets, that they were likely terminating proxies. Within the 18
mixed ASes, we find cellular demand comprising anywhere from
4.9% of total demand, up to 81% in certain ASes.
Based on this analysis, we consider any AS with a celular fraction
of demand greater than 0.9 to be a dedicated AS, and all those lower
than 0.9 to be mixed ASes. Applying this criteria to our dataset,
we find that 58.6% of cellular ASes are mixed networks, with 392
mixed to 276 dedicated cellular ASes. We find the locations of
mixed operators to be evenly distributed, and roughly half of all
detected cellular ASes within all continents. The fraction of mixed
operators across continents is relatively equally distributed, with
51% in Africa, 53% in Asia, 56% in Oceania, 61% in Europe, 69% in
North America, and 71% in South America. Looking at the demand
from each network type, we find that although they outnumber
dedicated networks, only 32.7% of cellular demand originates in
mixed networks.
Also shown in Figure 5 are the fraction of each AS’s subnets that
