User: I am running shellfish.py in my local machine. Can someone please explain me why I am getting this error: sh: qsub: command not found
Assistant: You specified --sge which is used to schedule jobs on Sun Grid Engine.
Since you want to run on your local machine instead of SGE, you should remove this flag.
