from the individual conversations. To this end, we extracted
the intelligence (i.e., SIM farm sites, fraud account sites, and
product links for fraud orders) targeted by Company A’s risk
assessment department from the traces of Aubrey’s conver-
sations with the 470 miscreants and also from the multicast
message logs of these miscreants’ IM chat groups. Note that
Aubrey’s intelligence came from a one-time conversation while
that from the group chats was extracted from month-long logs.
The results of this comparison are presented in Figure 9.
As we can see from the ﬁgure, the number of SIM farms and
fraud account sites disclosed from the conversations goes way
above what we can possibly glean from the one month group
chat logs. For fraud orders, however, group chats apparently
yield more information. This is because fraud order operators
tend to announce many job opportunities and descriptions
through multicast messages, while Aubrey operated as a small-
time worker and therefore could only ask for a small number
of jobs. Actually, we found that most intelligence from the
group chat logs was contributed by the fraud order operators
(95%). Also, although the 470 miscreants posted about 68K
messages to the IM groups in one month, only about 10K
unique messages were found. So if we look at the density of
the intelligence, using the links of resources as an example, we
can see that only two per thousand messages from the group
chats are useful, while 318 per thousand interaction rounds in
one-on-one conversation provide the targeted information.
C. Cross-Role Relations
conversations
The
about
cross-role questions
(Sec-
tion III-C) bring to light the complicity among different mis-
creants. Figure 10 presents the relations among the three roles
using a graph where each node is a criminal role, the directed
edge indicates that one refers the worker (i.e., Aubrey) to other
actor(s) during a conversation and the weight on the edge rep-
resents the number of miscreant providing such references. We
found that a SIM gateway website, FengHuoYun (sfoxer.com),
is frequently referred by account merchants. The website is one
of the largest SIM gateways, from which we gathered about
300K fraudulent phone numbers. Also interestingly, several
times automatic tools were recommended to Aubrey for bonus
hunting, such as those helping collect coupons and place orders
(see Section VI-A).
Another observation is that SIM cards could be recycled
for different fraud activities. Speciﬁcally, some account mer-
chants also act as SIM farmers by reselling the SIM cards
they used for registering fraudulent accounts. To investigate
the reselling activities, we manually analyzed 600 randomly
sampled SIM farmers’ messages that mention both SIM card
selling and purchasing in the group chats. Among them, 30
were conﬁrmed to engage in SIM card recycling: they ﬁrst
11
buy new SIM cards for bulk account registration on heavily
protected e-commerce platforms like Company A, and then
sell them as second-hand SIM cards to other miscreants. On
average it takes ﬁve months to go from the purchase to the
sell. Looking into the content of their messages, we found
that those farmers only buy new SIM cards, including those
issued in southeast Asian countries. The used SIM cards they
sell are often bought by the individuals who intend to register
accounts on less protected online platforms.
VII. CASE STUDY: REVENUE ANALYSIS
For better prevention of the threats,
to
understand the economic motivation of the miscreants. In this
section, we present case studies to analyze the revenues of
upstream players (SIM farmers, account merchants) and the
downstream actors (bonus hunters) in the e-commerce fraud
ecosystem.
it
is important
SIM farmer. SIM farmers monetize fraud phone numbers by
providing clients the SMS veriﬁcation code (Section II). Some
SIM farmers multicast the veriﬁcation codes in an IM group.
In our research, we collected such messages from group chats
to estimate the farmer’s sales volume. From one randomly
selected farmer, we collected 17.5K veriﬁcation messages in
one month. Considering the average price of one phone number
is $0.04 on her SIM gateway, this SIM farmer could earn at
least $786 per month from this channel, not to mention many
other SMS gateways she may operate.
When chatting with SIM farmers, Aubrey also inquired
about the inventory of SIM cards they have and the frequencies
to update these cards. From the information provided by eight
SIM farmers, we found that on average, a SIM farmer has 20K
phone numbers, which will be replaced in one month. So even
if each of these numbers receives only one SMS, the farmer
earns $890 per month. In practice, however, the same number
can at the very least be used to register accounts on different
websites, so the real revenue could come close to $8,900, even
with a conservative estimate of 10 websites. We should note
that the reliability of these numbers is difﬁcult to verify since
they are reported by the miscreants themselves.
Account merchant. To estimate the revenue of account mer-
chants, we monitored the fraud account inventory on one of
the most popular storefronts for 16 months. Figure 11 shows
the evolution of the account inventory and the price for one
of the most popular account types “new account registered on
mobile phone”. An interesting observation is that the inventory
is highly relevant to the events on e-commerce platforms: from
mid-November to mid-December and in June, there are two
shopping carnival events in China. Accordingly, the demands
for fraudulent accounts also reach their peaks in those periods.
This is because a large number of promotions are released
during the events, which triggers waves of bonus hunting
that need a lot of workers to purchase fraud accounts for the
jobs. Meanwhile, starting in early 2018, the inventory dropped
drastically and the price went up accordingly. One possible
explanation is that Company A started to enforce stricter
identity authentication in account registration, making it harder
to generate fake accounts, which triggered the price rise. We
note that the inventory and price changes are independent of
our study since it took place before we reported our ﬁndings.
12
With the evolution of the inventory and price, we estimate
the sales volume Si of day i by calculating the difference in
account inventory between day i and day i + 1 if we observe
the inventory decreases. This allows us to estimate the revenue
R(i) of day i as R(i) = Si × Pi, where Pi is the account
price on day i. In this way, we found that at least 5.7 million
accounts were sold during the monitored period (16 months),
which brought in a revenue of $771K, or roughly $48,000 per
month. In our research, we validated the inventory information
by buying accounts several times and observed the inventory
decrease in accordance with our purchases, which means that
the inventory information is reliable.
Bonus hunter. As mentioned earlier, the bonus hunters mon-
etize the fraud order by earning the proﬁt from the bonus.
Hence, to estimate their revenues, we utilize the following
model: R(t) = B(t) × O(t), where the total revenue R(t)
during the time period t is calculated from bonus per order
B(t) times the total number of orders O(t). In our study, we
monitored the fraud order tasks posted on the related websites.
Such a task post includes the bonus information B(t) (e.g.,
$7.50 bonus) and the number of orders O(t) that the bonus
hunter expects. More speciﬁcally, we collected 250 fraud order
tasks posted by one miscreant within one month. For these
tasks, assuming that all the orders were placed and delivered,
the miscreants could get $16,700 per month.
VIII. DISCUSSION
Scope. In our study, we investigated Chinese e-commerce
fraud activities. We acknowledge that
the limited vantage
points may limit the ﬁndings. In particular, the miscreants
that Aubrey chatted with speak Chinese, and the threat intel-
ligence we gathered is mainly related to Chinese e-commerce
platforms. To the best of our knowledge, e-commerce frauds
are more prevalent on Chinese e-commerce platforms than
those in other countries [15]. One possible cause is that such
crimes heavily rely on crowdsourcing (e.g., hiring small-time
workers) while China’s labor cost is relatively low. Actually,
we indeed observed in our research that Chinese IM groups are
also involved in fraud activities on international e-commerce
platforms like Amazon and eBay. Take account trading as
an example, in which the miscreant usually creates his own
fake enterprise accounts, hires scalpers to boost the accounts’
reputation, and later sells them at a premium price. We found
from the IM groups that miscreants are selling eBay enterprise
accounts with a price tag ranging from $75 to $750, together
with personal accounts on Chinese platform for $0.1 to $4.5.
We will
leave the active intelligence gathering from non-
Chinese crime sources as our future work.
Generalization. Currently, Aubrey focuses on the fraudsters
in Chinese underground e-commerce markets. However, it is
important to note that the design of Aubrey can also be adapted
to chat with miscreants in other domains and languages. As
reported in [9], [20], [21], IM and other social media channels
are becoming more prevalent among miscreants involved in
drug dealing, malware distribution and stolen credential trad-
ing, making IM the future of the dark web forum. Aubrey can
be used to chat with those miscreants. In particular, current
design provides a semi-automatic FSM generation and dialog
management method. Given the target goals (e.g., artifacts
collection) and domain-speciﬁc corpora, Aubrey’s Strategy

Generator, and Dialog Manager can be re-trained to
chat with other cybercriminals (e.g., drug dealers, malware
distributors and ﬁnancial fraudsters). We show an example
to utilize Aubrey for the threat
intelligence gathering of
underground fake review in Appendix Section B.
Impact.
In addition to understanding the e-commerce fraud
ecosystem, the artifacts collected by Aubrey can beneﬁt the
research community in numerous ways. For example, such
artifacts can be used as the ground truth for training machine
learning models to detect previously-unknown fraud accounts.
SIM card-related information is actually being used as a feature
in Company A’s fraudulent account detection system. Also,
with the item and shipping address information, Company A is
building a graph-based learning system to detect suspicious ac-
counts and orders. Also, by reverse-engineering the automatic
tools used by account miscreants and fraud order operators,
Company A has ﬁxed the exposed private APIs to raise the
bar for automated abuse on the platform. Furthermore, our
approach identiﬁed the upstream suppliers (e.g., SIM farmers)
for e-commerce fraud, which helps stop fraudulent activities
at the early stage.
Technical limitations. As shown in Figure 2, human efforts
were involved in FSM validation and threat artifact validation.
The goal of having human-in-the-loop is to guarantee the
quality of critical outputs (i.e., FSM and threat artifacts). A
possible solution could be using machine learning to auto-
matically generate the strategies from prior conversations and
continuously enhance the strategies from new interactions.
This path will be explored in the future. Other manual work
during system design, such as determining role identiﬁcation
indicators and constructing URL matching regex, is all related
to parameter or implementation settings, which is considered
to be one-time effort until the criminal business models evolve.
In our study, we found Aubrey is successful in discovering
threat intelligence from e-commerce miscreants due to the sta-
bility of the conversation in the underground business models.
However, we acknowledge that once the presence of Aubrey
is known to the miscreants, they may start more complicate
dialog, which requires Aubrey to be more generic and robust to
the conversation involving open-domain topics. Our implemen-
tation utilizes the state-of-the-art NLP techniques to improve
the quality of the conversation model (Appendix Section C).
However, the response analysis module and retrieval model can
certainly be further enhanced. For example, miscreants may
use jargon (e.g., ‘trumpet’ as a jargon of “fake account”) to
degrade the effectiveness of the response analysis module. To
handle an obfuscated response, a jargon identiﬁcation module
(e.g, [52]) can be added. Meanwhile,
larger open domain
corpora can be integrated into our system to strengthen the
retrieval model. In addition, to further improve the robustness
of Aubrey, a crowd-powered conversational assistant module
can be incorporated into the framework. In particular, a human
analyst can take over the chat when the chatbot cannot proceed
with the conversation [35].
Lesson learned. Since IM platforms are extensively used by
cybercriminals, policies should be in place to regulate how IM
groups should be created and properly managed. Although ef-
fort has been made on QQ to block some inappropriate words,
we observed that the cybercriminals successfully evade the
protection through character substitution, image-based content
dissemination, etc.
In our study, the traces obtained from one-on-one con-
versation with miscreants turn out to contain valuable threat
intelligence due to the miscreants moving their businesses to
the deep web, under the pressure of efforts against cybercrimes
on both surface web and dark web. In addition, the cross-
ecosystem conversations collected by Aubrey shed light on
the value chain of e-commerce frauds and the relations among
different miscreants roles. We found that account trading lies
at the center of the fraud ecosystem, with both SIM farmers
and fraud order operators extensively working with the account
merchants. Hence, to mitigate and further stop the threats in
e-commerce fraud, intervening at account trading can be an
effective way to break the criminal value chain. One possible
approach is to use multi-factor authentication and human-robot
recognition to raise the bar for account registration.
We have also observed that Aubrey is capable of inﬁltrating
the underground market highly relying on crowdsourcing, such
as e-commerce reputation manipulation and fraud account
trading. Such underground businesses require collaboration
between the upstream resource providers and the downstream
job ﬁnders, typically through online chat. Invaluable informa-
tion about their businesses can therefore be recovered from
their conversations. Further, our study has brought to light
interesting behaviors of different miscreants: for example,
as mentioned in Section IV-B, account traders were found
to be more responsive to our chatbot
than SIM farmers,
which turns out that the former need to interact with many
downstream small workers (i.e. fraud order operators) and thus
are more willing to talk to potential account buyers and provide
information. Such behaviors can help better understand how
underground businesses are operated and identify the strategies
for effectively inﬁltrating and disrupting them.

Legal and ethical concerns. Our study involves human
subjects and fraud account purchase, which could have legal
and ethical implications, particularly when it comes to conver-
sations and trading with miscreants. Therefore, we carefully
managed our research activities to ensure that they stayed
within the legal and ethical boundary. Speciﬁcally, our work
has been approved by our IRB and received Company A’s
permission to conduct experiments on it. We worked with
our IRB counsel and the company to design guidelines for
conversation and purchase, to ensure that we act under a legal
and ethical framework that minimizes any risk of harm to any
party. The guidelines for our study is available in Appendix B.
the approach in our study was legally deployed
under the sting operation guidance [13]. Note that Aubrey
is not for entrapment [6], where law enforcement “induces
a person to commit a criminal offense that the person would
have otherwise been unlikely or unwilling to commit”. In our
study, the e-commerce miscreants intend to promote and sell
their underground service on IM platform. Thus, the idea of
using Aubrey is promising for law enforcement to investigate
cybercrimes happening in the online marketplaces. Finally, we
responsibly disclosed our ﬁndings to both Company A and
the IM platform, which are working with law enforcement to
mitigate the online fraud activities discovered in our research.

IX. RELATED WORK
Study on underground markets. Recent years have observed
the growth of e-commerce underground markets, such as order
scalping and bonus hunting. However, they are still related to
the traditional cybercrimes but twist to e-commerce domain.
Reaves et al. [44] tracks more than 400 phone numbers on
public SMS gateways. Thomas et al. [46] characterize around
3,000 phone numbers associated with fraud phone veriﬁed
accounts such as preferred carriers and phone reuse. Thomas et
al. [47] also perform a study of 27 Twitter account merchants
to monitor account prices and availabilities. Xu et al. [49]
study ﬁve surface web order scalping websites and analyze
their revenue.
Previous studies on SIM farms and fraud accounts are
usually based on data that was passively crawled from the
surface web. Our work is the ﬁrst to actively collect threat
intelligence through individual conversation with miscreants,
which reveals threat artifacts on the deep web that have never
been reported. For example, compared to [44], our study
discovered 40 deep web SIM gateways, which can not be
searched on the surface web. They hosted signiﬁcantly larger
amounts of fraud phone numbers and conducted a different
operation model. Similar ﬁndings were observed on 35 deep
web hosting platforms hosting fraud account marketplaces,
