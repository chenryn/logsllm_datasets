would eliminate the large public parameters and the trusted setup,
at the cost of larger append-only proofs. This may well be worth it
if the proof size and prover time are not too large. Other argument
systems such as Hyrax [101], Ligero [5] and Aurora [11] could
achieve the same result. Unfortunately, Aurora and Ligero would
increase the append-only proof verification time to linear, which
could be prohibitive. Bulletproofs [24] would further increase this
verification time to quasilinear. Hyrax can make this time sublinear
if the circuit is sufficiently parallel or has “a wiring pattern [that]
satisfies a technical regularity condition” [101].
Recursively-composable arguments. Another interesting ap-
proach is to obtain AADs from recursively-composable SNARKs [12,
14]. Such SNARKs could structure the verification of the append-
only property recursively so that circuits need not operate on the
entire dictionary, thus lowering overheads. We are aware of concur-
rent work that explores this approach, but unfortunately it is not
peer-reviewed nor published in an online archive. While such an
approach could be very promising, currently implemented systems
operate at the 80-bit security level. This is because increasing the se-
curity of the elliptic curves used in recursive SNARK constructions
is costly, since they have low embedding degree [12]. In contrast,
our implementation is 100-bit-secure after accounting for recent
progress on computing discrete logs [66] and our q-SDH assump-
tion with q = 220 [16]. We can increase this to 118 bits, with no loss
in performance, by adopting 128-bit-secure BLS12-381 curves [19].
8 CONCLUSION
In this work, we introduced the first append-only authenticated
dictionary (AAD) that achieves polylogarithmic proof sizes and ap-
pend times. Unlike previous work, our construction only assumes
a single fully-malicious server and does not rely on users to “col-
lectively” verify the dictionary. Our analysis shows that AADs can
reduce the bandwidth in current CT logs and in CONIKS logs that
publish digests much more frequently than users check their PK
in the log. However, as our evaluation shows, AADs are not yet
practical enough for deployment, particularly because they have
high append times and memory usage. We hope future work can
overcome this by optimizing the construction, the implementation
or both. Finally, we also introduced the first efficient append-only
authenticated set (AAS), which can be used to implement Google’s
Revocation Transparency (RT) [58].
Open problems. We identify two interesting directions for future
work. First, can we build efficient AADs with polylogarithmic proof
sizes from standard assumptions, such as the existence of CRHFs?
If not, what are the lower bounds? Second, can we obtain “zero-
knowledge” AADs which leak nothing during queries?
