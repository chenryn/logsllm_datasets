Question: "An organization is revising its access control policies to prevent unauthorized data access. Based on the lessons learned from past cybersecurity incidents, which TWO of the following access control models would likely strengthen the organization's data security?"
 "A": "Implementing a role-based access control (RBAC) system where permissions are associated with roles rather than individual users, reducing the risk of insider threats."
 "B": "Allowing administrators to reset passwords without requiring additional verification, ensuring quick recovery of user accounts in case of password loss."
 "C": "Instituting a mandatory access control (MAC) system which enforces access policies determined by a central authority, thus limiting data access based on clearance levels."
 "D": "Adopting a model where all users have access to all files by default and must opt-in to secure their files individually, simplifying user experience."
