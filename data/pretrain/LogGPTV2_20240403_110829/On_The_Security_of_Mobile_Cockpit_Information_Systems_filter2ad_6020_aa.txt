ABSTRACT
Recent trends in aviation have led many general aviation pilots to
adopt the use of iPads (or other tablets) in the cockpit. While initially
used to display static charts and documents, uses have expanded
to include live data such as weather and trafﬁc information that is
used to make ﬂight decisions. Because the tablet and any connected
devices are not a part of the onboard systems, they are not currently
subject to the software reliability standards applied to avionics. In
this paper, we create a risk model for electronic threats against
mobile cockpit information systems and evaluate three such systems
popular with general aviation pilots today: The Appareo Stratus
2 receiver with the ForeFlight app, the Garmin GDL 39 receiver
with the Garmin Pilot app, and the SageTech Clarity CL01 with the
WingX Pro7 app. We found all three to be vulnerable, allowing an
attacker to manipulate information presented to the pilot, which in
some scenarios would lead to catastrophic outcomes. Finally, we
provide recommendations for securing such systems.

INTRODUCTION
Modern tablet PCs and smart phones offer a capable low-cost
platform for many applications that have until recently required
special-purpose hardware. In most cases—point-of-sale terminals,
information kiosks, home automation controls, and so on—our
expectations of security and reliability are on par with everyday
consumer electronics. There are domains, however, where we expect
near-absolute security and reliability. Among them is aviation,
where a malfunctioning safety-critical system can lead to loss of life.
The use of consumer mobile electronics in a capacity where they
can affect ﬂight safety thus warrants closer scrutiny.

In this paper we examine a particular use of mobile devices in
general aviation, in which an iPad (or similar tablet) supplements
conventional ﬂight and navigation instruments. An app running
on the iPad communicates with a separate handheld device, which
combines a GPS receiver with additional aeronautical information
receivers into a single unit. We term this combination of tablet,
app, and receiver a Mobile Cockpit Information System (MCIS). A
state-of-the-art MCIS presents the pilot with a uniﬁed moving map
display showing aircraft position overlaid on an aeronautical chart.
Depending on the aeronautical information services supported by the
receiver, the display may also include a graphical weather overlay
(FIS-B service) and may display nearby aircraft (ADS-B and TIS-B
service). Some receivers also include solid-state magnetometers
and accelerometers, which provides the app with aircraft magnetic
heading and attitude (pitch and roll).
The iPad is often mounted alongside conventional instruments
(Figure 1), mimicking the glass cockpit found on modern high-end
aircraft. In this conﬁguration, the iPad effectively becomes part
of the cockpit instrument panel. However, because it is a pilot’s
portable electronic device, and not part of the aircraft, it is not subject
to aviation electronics (avionics) airworthiness requirements. This
regulatory exemption allows MCISes to be developed at the cost
and pace of modern mobile apps and consumer electronics. At issue
is whether this rapid growth in features and capabilities comes at the
cost of security, and this is the ﬁrst question we address in this paper:
8 Do mobile cockpit information systems provide the secu-
rity guarantees expected of similar avionics systems?
Answering this question requires an agreed upon notion of the
security we expect of such systems. In the computer security com-
munity, we formulate security properties as hypotheses subject to
refutation by an attack that causes the target system to exhibit some
undesired behavior or reveal some secret information. Whether an
attack succeeds or fails is well deﬁned, and depends only on the
target itself. In this setting, the most natural MCIS security property
concerns the authenticity of information presented to the pilot. In
other words, in this setting, an MCIS is secure if an attacker cannot
cause it to present false information to the pilot.
By this measure, current mobile cockpit information systems are
not secure against a variety of attacks. In addition to the already-
known attacks on GPS and the underlying aeronautical information
services (ADS-B, TIS-B, and FIS-B), the systems we examined are
also vulnerable to MCIS-speciﬁc attacks, the most severe of which
allows an attacker to reﬂash receiver ﬁrmware, giving him complete
control over when and what information is presented to the pilot.
In the aviation community, security of avionics systems is viewed
as a matter of reliability, which is itself part of the overall airwor-
thiness determination for an avionics system. Reliability differs
633determine the true state of affairs. This point is worth emphasizing:
modern aviation safety depends on pilots successfully reconciling
possibly conﬂicting information presented by multiple sources. In
this regime, the FAA considers current aeronautical information
services (ADS-B, TIS-B, and FIS-B) supplementary in nature.
For example, AC 20–172A states, “The installation of ADS-B in
avionics provides the pilot(s) with supplemental information.” In
this view, there is no harm in additional information, because pilots
can optimally reconcile all information presented to them. By neces-
sity, this must hold even when some sources are manipulated by an
attacker. We believe this view is too optimistic: it is unreasonable to
expect pilots to always correctly reconcile conﬂicting information
presented by multiple systems. It becomes necessary, therefore, to
consider pilot decision-making in order to assign potential outcomes
to attacks on information systems.
We propose one way of modeling this decision-making process
when an information system is under attacker control. We believe
our approach may be useful in the analysis of similar systems. It
is not a replacement, however, for empirical evaluation. Thus, our
answer to the above question is only partial; however, we believe
that it is a fruitful ﬁrst step.
In Section 6 we evaluate several MCISes on the market today. Our
analysis ﬁnds that under several scenarios an attacker with modest
capabilities can exploit the weak security of these systems to cause
catastrophic outcomes. The situation need not be hopeless, however.
The third question we investigate is:
8 Can consumer mobile cockpit information systems be re-
designed to satisfy the airworthiness requirements of com-
parable avionics systems?
Our answer is a guarded yes, although concerns about the integrity
of GPS and aeronautical information service signals themselves
still remain. We make several recommendations for securing such
systems, and we believe the proposals do not impose an undue
burden on developers.
In summary, our contributions are:
O We deﬁne the security threats facing Mobile Cockpit
Information Systems (MCISes) and develop a model
for evaluating information systems where assessing the
severity of potential attacks requires modeling a human
operator.
O We analyze three existing MCISes. We ﬁnd that all
three allow an attacker to provide false information to
the pilot; two of these systems allow an attacker to carry
out a delayed or situation-triggered attack by replacing
receiver ﬁrmware; all three are vulnerable to a malicious
app installed on the tablet device.
O We provide recommendations for securing MCISes that
would protect against the MCIS-speciﬁc vulnerabilities
we identiﬁed. We believe our recommendations do not
impose an undue burden on developers.
2. BACKGROUND
This work is about mobile cockpit information systems (MCISes)
used by pilots as an aid to situation awareness during ﬂight. MCISes
are targeted at pilots in small general aviation aircraft that lack
the sophisticated cockpit information systems found on larger and
newer aircraft. Physically, an MCIS consists of two devices: an
aeronautical information service receiver and a general-purpose
tablet PC—most commonly an iPad. The receiver relays broadcasts
from multiple aeronautical information services to the app, which
presents the information to the pilot. Figure 3 illustrates these
components, which we describe next.

from security in its adversary: the adversary of reliability is Nature,
while the adversary of security is a motivated attacker. In reliability
analysis, Nature is a stochastic process that can be tamed by driving
the probability of a system failure to an acceptable level. However,
unless a system is absolutely reliable, a determined attacker can
exploit the tiniest sliver of vulnerability. These were lessons learned
two decades ago by the computer security community. The inherited
wisdom of that experience is that security requires separate explicit
consideration.
Reliability as considered in airworthiness determination differs
from computer security in another important way. The airworthiness
of a system is considered in terms of its effect on overall ﬂight
outcome should the system fail. By way of example, FAA Advisory
Circular (AC) No. 20–149A, which describes one means of gain-
ing airworthiness approval for FIS-B avionics installed on aircraft,
mandates that, “the effect of undetected errors in FIS-B products
... is no greater than a minor failure condition.” A “minor failure
condition” is one which does not signiﬁcantly reduce aircraft safety
and which involves crew actions well within their capabilities [16,
Ch. 3]. Thus, airworthiness depends not only on the component
itself, but also on the severity of the overall outcome taking into
account crew actions.
For computer security analysis to be practically useful in deter-
mining airworthiness, we must reason about possible crew actions
in response to (detected or undetected) attacks. In other words, to
connect security results to airworthiness, we must connect MCIS
output to pilot actions to overall ﬂight safety. This is the second
question we consider:
8 How does the security of mobile cockpit information sys-
tems affect ﬂight safety?
There are two ways to go about answering this question. The ﬁrst
is empirical, using experiments with pilots in a controlled setting.
While this approach is the most reliable, it is cost-prohibitive and
unlikely to be adopted by manufacturers or regulators.
The second approach is to work with a model of pilot decision-
making. The simplest such model assumes, pessimistically, that
a pilot will accept as correct all information presented to her by a
compromised MCIS and act accordingly. Unfortunately, this line
of reasoning leads one to conclude, for example, that nearly all
navigation systems (GPS, VOR/DME, ILS) should not be used
because they all are easily spoofed. The way out of this conundrum
is to insist that the pilot rely on multiple sources of information to

2.1 Aeronautical Information Services
Mobile cockpit information systems are built around three aero-
nautical information services.
2.1.1 GPS
Most readers are already familiar with the Global Positioning
System (GPS), a satellite-based positioning system. GPS receivers
are entirely passive, allowing the 32-satellite constellation to support
an arbitrary number of users. GPS receivers provide horizontal accu-
racy down to one meter [25], making GPS an attractive alternative to
the system of ground-based navigation aids still in wide use today.
Known vulnerabilities. The non-interactive (passive) nature of
GPS makes it vulnerable to replay attacks. Moreover, the non-
military navigation signal is unauthenticated, making spooﬁng pos-
sible. These shortcomings of GPS are well known, with results
on GPS spooﬁng [27, 28, 38, 46, 51, 57, 59], software attacks on
GPS [41], GPS cryptography [60], and more [3, 9, 11, 29, 31, 43,
47, 48, 52, 55, 61]. In this work, we do not address these attacks
and proposed ﬁxes. We note, however, that attacks on GPS require
the attacker to transmit a GPS signal. Ground-based attacks against
an airborne target would be detectable by nearby receivers.
2.1.2 ADS-B and TIS-B
Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast (ADS-B) is an air-
craft position self-reporting system. An aircraft equipped with an
ADS-B transmitter broadcasts its own position (obtained from a
source such as GPS); aircraft equipped with an ADS-B receiver
can display other aircraft to the pilot and issue collision avoidance
warnings if necessary. The United States Federal Aviation Admin-
istration (FAA) has mandated that by 2020, all aircraft operating
in airspace that today requires a transponder will be required to
broadcast their position via ADS-B. The receivers considered in this
work do not transmit ADS-B data; they only receive ADS-B from
aircraft equipped to do so.
Trafﬁc Information Service–Broadcast (TIS-B) is an aircraft posi-
tion reporting system. TIS-B uses the same data format as ADS-B;
however, TIS-B position information is broadcast by FAA ground
stations in the United States and includes aircraft positions from
radar-based aircraft tracking systems. As such, it provides a transi-
tion to ADS-B by allowing aircraft equipped with ADS-B to know
about aircraft using a transponder only.
There are two data links used to disseminate ADS-B and TIS-B:
Mode S Extended Squitter on 1090 MHz (1090ES) and Universal
Access Transceiver protocol on 978 MHz (UAT). Both data links
have a data rate of 1 Mbit/sec; however, 1090ES uses 112-bit packets
while the UAT data link supports larger packet sizes, making it more
suitable for larger messages. UAT is only used in the United States.
Known vulnerabilities. ADS-B and TIS-B services are provided
over the 1090ES and UAT data links, neither of which is authen-
ticated. Attacks on these services have been considered in the
research community [7, 50, 54, 56]; Strohmeier et al. [54] provide
an overview of this problem and propose a number of solutions.
Like GPS attacks, these require a transmitter and may be detected
by other receivers near the victim.
2.1.3 FIS-B
Flight Information Service–Broadcast (FIS-B) provides several
kinds of real-time information, most notably graphical weather data.
Like TIS-B, FIS-B is a free broadcast service provided by the FAA.
Figure 2 (center and right) shows TIS-B weather data overlaid on
an aeronautical chart. FIS-B also provides textual weather and
time-sensitive pilot advisories.
Known vulnerabilities. Like ADS-B and TIS-B, FIS-B is trans-
mitted over the unauthenticated UAT data link; it is, therefore, also
vulnerable to spooﬁng.
2.2 Aeronautical Information Receivers
Availability of the services described above has created a market
for devices capable of receiving and displaying this information.
While it is possible to equip an aircraft with avionics capable of
receiving and presenting this information on a cockpit display, an
MCIS is a far cheaper alternative for doing so.
The portable aeronautical information receivers that are the sub-
ject of this work combine a GPS receiver and UAT receiver into a
