## Abstract
Recent trends in aviation have led many general aviation pilots to adopt the use of iPads (or other tablets) in the cockpit. Initially used to display static charts and documents, these devices now provide live data such as weather and traffic information, which are used to make flight decisions. Because these tablets and connected devices are not part of the onboard systems, they are not subject to the software reliability standards applied to avionics. In this paper, we create a risk model for electronic threats against mobile cockpit information systems and evaluate three popular systems: The Appareo Stratus 2 receiver with the ForeFlight app, the Garmin GDL 39 receiver with the Garmin Pilot app, and the SageTech Clarity CL01 with the WingX Pro7 app. We found all three systems to be vulnerable, allowing an attacker to manipulate information presented to the pilot, potentially leading to catastrophic outcomes. Finally, we provide recommendations for securing such systems.

## 1. Introduction
Modern tablet PCs and smartphones offer a capable, low-cost platform for many applications that previously required specialized hardware. In most cases—such as point-of-sale terminals, information kiosks, and home automation controls—our expectations of security and reliability are similar to those for everyday consumer electronics. However, in domains like aviation, where a malfunctioning safety-critical system can lead to loss of life, near-absolute security and reliability are expected. The use of consumer mobile electronics in a capacity that can affect flight safety thus warrants closer scrutiny.

In this paper, we examine the use of mobile devices in general aviation, where an iPad (or similar tablet) supplements conventional flight and navigation instruments. An app running on the iPad communicates with a separate handheld device, which combines a GPS receiver with additional aeronautical information receivers into a single unit. We term this combination of tablet, app, and receiver a Mobile Cockpit Information System (MCIS). A state-of-the-art MCIS presents the pilot with a unified moving map display showing aircraft position overlaid on an aeronautical chart. Depending on the aeronautical information services supported by the receiver, the display may also include a graphical weather overlay (FIS-B service) and nearby aircraft (ADS-B and TIS-B service). Some receivers also include solid-state magnetometers and accelerometers, providing the app with aircraft magnetic heading and attitude (pitch and roll).

The iPad is often mounted alongside conventional instruments, mimicking the glass cockpit found on modern high-end aircraft. In this configuration, the iPad effectively becomes part of the cockpit instrument panel. However, because it is a portable electronic device and not part of the aircraft, it is not subject to aviation electronics (avionics) airworthiness requirements. This regulatory exemption allows MCISes to be developed at the cost and pace of modern mobile apps and consumer electronics. The question arises whether this rapid growth in features and capabilities comes at the cost of security. This is the first question we address in this paper:

**Do mobile cockpit information systems provide the security guarantees expected of similar avionics systems?**

Answering this question requires an agreed-upon notion of the security we expect from such systems. In the computer security community, security properties are formulated as hypotheses subject to refutation by an attack that causes the target system to exhibit undesired behavior or reveal secret information. Whether an attack succeeds or fails is well-defined and depends only on the target itself. In this setting, the most natural MCIS security property concerns the authenticity of information presented to the pilot. In other words, an MCIS is secure if an attacker cannot cause it to present false information to the pilot.

By this measure, current mobile cockpit information systems are not secure against a variety of attacks. In addition to known attacks on GPS and the underlying aeronautical information services (ADS-B, TIS-B, and FIS-B), the systems we examined are also vulnerable to MCIS-specific attacks. The most severe of these allows an attacker to reflash receiver firmware, giving them complete control over when and what information is presented to the pilot.

In the aviation community, the security of avionics systems is viewed as a matter of reliability, which is part of the overall airworthiness determination. Reliability differs from security in its adversary: the adversary of reliability is nature, while the adversary of security is a motivated attacker. In reliability analysis, nature is a stochastic process that can be tamed by driving the probability of system failure to an acceptable level. However, unless a system is absolutely reliable, a determined attacker can exploit the tiniest vulnerability. These lessons were learned two decades ago by the computer security community, and the inherited wisdom is that security requires separate, explicit consideration.

Reliability, as considered in airworthiness determination, also differs from computer security in another important way. The airworthiness of a system is considered in terms of its effect on overall flight outcome should the system fail. For example, FAA Advisory Circular (AC) No. 20–149A, which describes one means of gaining airworthiness approval for FIS-B avionics installed on aircraft, mandates that "the effect of undetected errors in FIS-B products... is no greater than a minor failure condition." A "minor failure condition" is one that does not significantly reduce aircraft safety and involves crew actions well within their capabilities. Thus, airworthiness depends not only on the component itself but also on the severity of the overall outcome, taking into account crew actions.

For computer security analysis to be practically useful in determining airworthiness, we must reason about possible crew actions in response to (detected or undetected) attacks. In other words, to connect security results to airworthiness, we must connect MCIS output to pilot actions to overall flight safety. This is the second question we consider:

**How does the security of mobile cockpit information systems affect flight safety?**

There are two ways to answer this question. The first is empirical, using experiments with pilots in a controlled setting. While this approach is the most reliable, it is cost-prohibitive and unlikely to be adopted by manufacturers or regulators.

The second approach is to work with a model of pilot decision-making. The simplest such model assumes, pessimistically, that a pilot will accept as correct all information presented by a compromised MCIS and act accordingly. Unfortunately, this line of reasoning leads one to conclude, for example, that nearly all navigation systems (GPS, VOR/DME, ILS) should not be used because they can all be easily spoofed. The solution is to insist that the pilot rely on multiple sources of information to determine the true state of affairs. This point is worth emphasizing: modern aviation safety depends on pilots successfully reconciling possibly conflicting information presented by multiple sources. In this regime, the FAA considers current aeronautical information services (ADS-B, TIS-B, and FIS-B) supplementary in nature. For example, AC 20–172A states, "The installation of ADS-B in avionics provides the pilot(s) with supplemental information." In this view, there is no harm in additional information, because pilots can optimally reconcile all information presented to them. By necessity, this must hold even when some sources are manipulated by an attacker. We believe this view is too optimistic: it is unreasonable to expect pilots to always correctly reconcile conflicting information presented by multiple systems. It becomes necessary, therefore, to consider pilot decision-making in order to assign potential outcomes to attacks on information systems.

We propose one way of modeling this decision-making process when an information system is under attacker control. We believe our approach may be useful in the analysis of similar systems. It is not a replacement, however, for empirical evaluation. Thus, our answer to the above question is only partial; however, we believe that it is a fruitful first step.

In Section 6, we evaluate several MCISes on the market today. Our analysis finds that under several scenarios, an attacker with modest capabilities can exploit the weak security of these systems to cause catastrophic outcomes. The situation need not be hopeless, however. The third question we investigate is:

**Can consumer mobile cockpit information systems be redesigned to satisfy the airworthiness requirements of comparable avionics systems?**

Our answer is a guarded yes, although concerns about the integrity of GPS and aeronautical information service signals themselves still remain. We make several recommendations for securing such systems, and we believe the proposals do not impose an undue burden on developers.

In summary, our contributions are:
- We define the security threats facing Mobile Cockpit Information Systems (MCISes) and develop a model for evaluating information systems where assessing the severity of potential attacks requires modeling a human operator.
- We analyze three existing MCISes. We find that all three allow an attacker to provide false information to the pilot; two of these systems allow an attacker to carry out a delayed or situation-triggered attack by replacing receiver firmware; all three are vulnerable to a malicious app installed on the tablet device.
- We provide recommendations for securing MCISes that would protect against the MCIS-specific vulnerabilities we identified. We believe our recommendations do not impose an undue burden on developers.

## 2. Background
This work focuses on mobile cockpit information systems (MCISes) used by pilots as an aid to situational awareness during flight. MCISes are targeted at pilots in small general aviation aircraft that lack the sophisticated cockpit information systems found on larger and newer aircraft. Physically, an MCIS consists of two devices: an aeronautical information service receiver and a general-purpose tablet PC—most commonly an iPad. The receiver relays broadcasts from multiple aeronautical information services to the app, which presents the information to the pilot. Figure 3 illustrates these components, which we describe next.

### 2.1 Aeronautical Information Services
Mobile cockpit information systems are built around three aeronautical information services.

#### 2.1.1 GPS
Most readers are already familiar with the Global Positioning System (GPS), a satellite-based positioning system. GPS receivers are entirely passive, allowing the 32-satellite constellation to support an arbitrary number of users. GPS receivers provide horizontal accuracy down to one meter, making GPS an attractive alternative to the system of ground-based navigation aids still in wide use today.

**Known Vulnerabilities:** The non-interactive (passive) nature of GPS makes it vulnerable to replay attacks. Moreover, the non-military navigation signal is unauthenticated, making spoofing possible. These shortcomings of GPS are well known, with numerous studies on GPS spoofing, software attacks, and more. In this work, we do not address these attacks and proposed fixes. However, we note that attacks on GPS require the attacker to transmit a GPS signal, and ground-based attacks against an airborne target would be detectable by nearby receivers.

#### 2.1.2 ADS-B and TIS-B
Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast (ADS-B) is an aircraft position self-reporting system. An aircraft equipped with an ADS-B transmitter broadcasts its own position (obtained from a source such as GPS); aircraft equipped with an ADS-B receiver can display other aircraft to the pilot and issue collision avoidance warnings if necessary. The United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has mandated that by 2020, all aircraft operating in airspace that today requires a transponder will be required to broadcast their position via ADS-B. The receivers considered in this work do not transmit ADS-B data; they only receive ADS-B from aircraft equipped to do so.

Trafﬁc Information Service–Broadcast (TIS-B) is an aircraft position reporting system. TIS-B uses the same data format as ADS-B; however, TIS-B position information is broadcast by FAA ground stations in the United States and includes aircraft positions from radar-based aircraft tracking systems. As such, it provides a transition to ADS-B by allowing aircraft equipped with ADS-B to know about aircraft using a transponder only.

There are two data links used to disseminate ADS-B and TIS-B: Mode S Extended Squitter on 1090 MHz (1090ES) and Universal Access Transceiver protocol on 978 MHz (UAT). Both data links have a data rate of 1 Mbit/sec; however, 1090ES uses 112-bit packets while the UAT data link supports larger packet sizes, making it more suitable for larger messages. UAT is only used in the United States.

**Known Vulnerabilities:** ADS-B and TIS-B services are provided over the 1090ES and UAT data links, neither of which is authenticated. Attacks on these services have been considered in the research community, and Strohmeier et al. provide an overview of this problem and propose a number of solutions. Like GPS attacks, these require a transmitter and may be detected by other receivers near the victim.

#### 2.1.3 FIS-B
Flight Information Service–Broadcast (FIS-B) provides several kinds of real-time information, most notably graphical weather data. Like TIS-B, FIS-B is a free broadcast service provided by the FAA. Figure 2 (center and right) shows TIS-B weather data overlaid on an aeronautical chart. FIS-B also provides textual weather and time-sensitive pilot advisories.

**Known Vulnerabilities:** Like ADS-B and TIS-B, FIS-B is transmitted over the unauthenticated UAT data link and is therefore also vulnerable to spoofing.

### 2.2 Aeronautical Information Receivers
The availability of the services described above has created a market for devices capable of receiving and displaying this information. While it is possible to equip an aircraft with avionics capable of receiving and presenting this information on a cockpit display, an MCIS is a far cheaper alternative for doing so.

The portable aeronautical information receivers that are the subject of this work combine a GPS receiver and UAT receiver into a single unit.
