velocity of floor 1 relative to the ground ¤𝑥 𝑓 1, and (viii) velocity of
floor 2 relative to the ground ¤𝑥 𝑓 2. The vector z defines the variables
that we want to attack, namely the ISD at floors 1 and 2, and their
velocities.
5.1 DoS Attack
We used the optimization process in Eq. (2) to design a DoS attack
on the two-story building, based on the physical equations of the
testbed (see Appendix B). In this process, the 𝐻2 norm is computed
from the response of the system for external disturbances at fre-
quencies ranging from 0Hz to 10Hz, which is the maximum allowed
vibration frequency of the structure. In this case study, the attacker
evaluates the response of the system for four different scenarios:
the controlled system (no disconnections), disconnecting actuator 1
(𝑢1), disconnecting actuator 2 (𝑢2), or disconnecting both actuators.
Fig. 9 shows the frequency response, and Table 2 shows the 𝐻2
norm in these scenarios.
From Fig. 9 and Table 2, we can see that an adversary that con-
ducts the optimization process in Eq. (2) to deliver a DoS attack on
this building will disconnect all actuators if possible. If the adversary
can only disconnect one actuator, it will choose actuator 1.
To illustrate this result, we tested two external disturbances. First,
we used the Kanai-Tajimi model [53, 85], which is commonly used
Figure 10: Our experimental results in the testbed match our
prediction that disconnecting 𝑢1 will cause a larger maxi-
mum ISD than disconnecting 𝑢2.
to artificially generate earthquake-like disturbances, to create 200
time-series of artificial ground motions with different frequencies
ranging from 1 Hz to 11 Hz. This range of frequencies is commonly
seen in earthquakes[43]. In these experiments, 70.5% of the time,
disconnecting actuator 1 produced a larger ISD than disconnecting
actuator 2, confirming the prediction of our theory and optimization
problem.
Second, we tested the laboratory bench-scale model by discon-
necting one actuator when the disturbance is the time series cor-
responding to the recording of the famous Kobe earthquake that
occurred in Japan in 1995 [74]. This recording is widely used as a
reference to test vibration attenuation systems due to its impact on
civil structures. Fig. 11 shows the response of the system when the
DoS attack disconnects actuator 1 and when the attack disconnects
actuator 2. The maximum ISD per story is shown in Fig. 10. The
behavior of this real bench-scale model shows that a DoS attack
that blocks actuator 1, as it was designed, has a bigger impact than
the one that blocks actuator 2 (confirming our prediction again).

From these plots, the highest peak occurs when 𝑢1 is manipulated.
Since these responses are shown on a logarithmic scale (decibels),
the difference between these two responses is significant. Here, the
highest peak occurs at 0.68Hz. Using this information, the adversary
injects a control command with a frequency of 0.68Hz. In the second
step of the FDI attack design process, the adversary determines the
magnitude and phase of the attacks sent to actuators.

that the system’s response with respect to 𝑢1 has its highest

prediction that the attack with 𝑢1 would cause larger dam-
ages (a larger maximum ISD).

structure.
5.2 FDI Attack
We now use the design process in Section 4.3 to design an FDI attack
for the testbed based on the model in Appendix B. Fig. 13 shows
the frequency response of the building with respect to the action
of 𝑢1 (signal of actuator 1) on the system and the response of the
building with respect to the action of 𝑢2 (actuator 2) on the system.
For comparison purposes, we also studied the scenario when
only actuator 2 is attacked using a signal at a frequency where
the maximum peak occurs, that is, 0.70Hz (see Fig. 13). The ISD vs.
time in the real plant for both attacks is shown in Fig. 12. Fig. 14
shows the maximum ISD for both attacks. From these experimental
results, it is clear that attacking signal 𝑢1 is the best decision that
an attacker should take based on the model to generate the worst
damage in the structure. This is consistent with the result in Fig.
13 obtained from the mathematical model of the building. Fig. 15

shows the maximum displacement of the real plant when the attack
on one of the actuators is deployed.
To show that our designed attack using Eq. (4) is the one that will
generate the largest impact on the structure, we injected signals on
actuator 1 at different frequencies but with the same amplitude. We
injected sinusoidal actuation signals at frequencies 1.11 Hz, 1.27 Hz,
and 1.43 Hz for comparison purposes and compared them to our
predicted optimal attack at 0.68Hz Fig. 16 shows the results using
these test signals. An anonymized video of this comparison can
be seen at https://youtu.be/vM_n1t92NJg. We confirm that these
higher-frequency attacks result in smaller ISDs than our optimal
design.

6 ATTACKING A BUILDING WITH
SEMI-ACTIVE DAMPERS
To study more realistic scenarios, we start using standard models of
large scale structures. This case study consists in a benchmark 20-
story building shown in Fig. 17 supplied by the Structural Engineer
Association of California (SAC) [84]. The structure has magnetorhe-
ological (MR) fluid dampers at every story that work as semi-active
control devices, and it is modeled as an in-plane lumped-mass shear
structure.
The mass of story 1 is 1.126 × 106 kg, masses from story 2 to
story 19 are 1.100 × 106 kg, and the mass of story 20 is 1.170 × 106
kg. The inter-story stiffness are the following: from story 1 to story
5 are 862.07 × 103 kN/m, from story 6 to story 11 are 554.17 × 103
kN/m, from story 12 to story 14 are 453.51 × 103 kN/m, from story
15 to story 17 are 291.23 × 103 kN/m, for story 18 and story 19 are
Figure 17: a) Benchmark 20-story high-rise building, b) its
layout of actuators, and c) a close-up of the MR damper.
The state variables of the vector x are the displacement and
velocity of each of the 20 stories of the building. Similarly, since the
adversary wants to maximize the ISD, z in Equation (1) is defined as
a vector of the ISD at each floor. The ASCE 7-16 standard states that
ISD ratios above 1% can compromise the integrity of the structure.
The dynamic behavior of the MR damper is based on the Bouc-
Wen hysteretic model in parallel with a dashpot added for a nonlin-
ear "roll-off" effect. The force produced by this model is a function
of the velocity of the device, an evolutionary variable, a set of param-
eters controlling the behavior of the hysteresis, and the command
voltage applied to the current driver. The values of the parameters
used in this study have a capacity of 1000kN [103] and scaled to
have this capacity with a maximum voltage of 10 V.
The control algorithm for this system consists of an LQR al-
gorithm as the primary controller that determines the command
force (𝑓𝑐 ), and a clipped-optimal controller that defines the in-
put voltage to the MR dampers (𝑣). The latter can be expressed
as [28]:𝑣 = 𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝐻 ((𝑓𝑐 − 𝑓 ) 𝑓 ), where 𝑓 is the force of the MR
damper, 𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥 is the maximum voltage, and 𝐻 (.) is the Heaviside
step function.
We used the optimization process in Equation (2) to design a
DoS attack on the 20-story building. Fig. 18 shows the 𝐻2 norm
and the maximum ISD ratio for all stories when the DoS attack is
deployed on 𝑘 actuators, from 𝑘 = 1 to 𝑘 = 20, when the building is
under a 0.7 łEl Centrož earthquake [90].
Note that when you only disconnect 12 actuators you get a
better attack (higher ISD) than when you disconnect all 16 of them.
Furthermore, the ISD ratio surpasses the safety limit of 1% after
disabling only 5 actuators! This information is important, because
an attacker might not be able to attack every actuator. With the
proposed algorithm, an optimal attack can be designed for whatever
number of actuators an attacker can affect.
Fig. 19 shows which actuators are disabled by the genetic algo-
rithm for each designed attack. It can be seen that the algorithm
