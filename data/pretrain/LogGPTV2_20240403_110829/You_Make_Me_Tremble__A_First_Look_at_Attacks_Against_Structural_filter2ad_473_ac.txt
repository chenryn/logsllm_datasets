### Table 2: \( H_2 \) Norm for Different Configurations of the System in Fig. 8 under DoS Attacks

| Attack Configuration | \( H_2 \) Norm (dB) |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| Uncontrolled          | -16.26              |

- \( \dot{x}_{f1} \): Velocity of floor 1 relative to the ground.
- \( \dot{x}_{f2} \): Velocity of floor 2 relative to the ground.
- The vector \( z \) defines the variables we want to attack, specifically the inter-story drift (ISD) at floors 1 and 2, and their velocities.

### 5.1 DoS Attack

We used the optimization process in Eq. (2) to design a DoS attack on the two-story building, based on the physical equations of the testbed (see Appendix B). In this process, the \( H_2 \) norm is computed from the system's response to external disturbances at frequencies ranging from 0 Hz to 10 Hz, which is the maximum allowed vibration frequency of the structure. The attacker evaluates the system's response in four different scenarios:
1. Controlled system (no disconnections).
2. Disconnecting actuator 1 (\( u_1 \)).
3. Disconnecting actuator 2 (\( u_2 \)).
4. Disconnecting both actuators.

Figure 9 shows the frequency response, and Table 2 provides the \( H_2 \) norm for these scenarios.

From Figure 9 and Table 2, it is evident that an adversary conducting the optimization process in Eq. (2) to deliver a DoS attack on this building will disconnect all actuators if possible. If only one actuator can be disconnected, the adversary will choose actuator 1.

To illustrate this result, we tested two types of external disturbances:
1. **Kanai-Tajimi Model**: We used the Kanai-Tajimi model [53, 85], commonly used to generate artificial earthquake-like disturbances, to create 200 time-series of artificial ground motions with frequencies ranging from 1 Hz to 11 Hz. This range of frequencies is typical in earthquakes [43]. In 70.5% of the cases, disconnecting actuator 1 resulted in a larger ISD than disconnecting actuator 2, confirming our theoretical predictions and the optimization problem.
   
   - **Figure 10**: Our experimental results in the testbed match our prediction that disconnecting \( u_1 \) will cause a larger maximum ISD than disconnecting \( u_2 \).

2. **Kobe Earthquake Data**: We tested the laboratory bench-scale model by disconnecting one actuator when the disturbance was the time series corresponding to the 1995 Kobe earthquake [74]. This recording is widely used as a reference to test vibration attenuation systems due to its impact on civil structures. Figure 11 shows the system's response when the DoS attack disconnects actuator 1 and when it disconnects actuator 2. The maximum ISD per story is shown in Figure 10. The behavior of the real bench-scale model confirms that a DoS attack blocking actuator 1 has a greater impact than blocking actuator 2.

- **Figure 11**: ISD vs. time of the bench-scale structure for two different DoS attacks (above: blocking actuator 1, and below: blocking actuator 2), when the Kobe earthquake-like disturbance is exerted on the system.

From these plots, the highest peak occurs when \( u_1 \) is manipulated. Since these responses are shown on a logarithmic scale (decibels), the difference between the two responses is significant. The highest peak occurs at 0.68 Hz. Using this information, the adversary injects a control command with a frequency of 0.68 Hz. In the second step of the FDI attack design process, the adversary determines the magnitude and phase of the attacks sent to the actuators.

- **Figure 13**: Frequency response of the system with respect to \( u_1 \) (actuator 1) and \( u_2 \) (actuator 2). Note that the system’s response with respect to \( u_1 \) has its highest peak when actuator 1 is manipulated at 0.68 Hz; the response of the system with respect to \( u_2 \) has its highest peak when actuator 2 is manipulated at 0.70 Hz.

- **Figure 14**: Our experimental results confirm our theoretical prediction that the attack with \( u_1 \) would cause larger damages (a larger maximum ISD).

### 5.2 FDI Attack

We use the design process in Section 4.3 to design an FDI attack for the testbed based on the model in Appendix B. Figure 13 shows the frequency response of the building with respect to the action of \( u_1 \) (signal of actuator 1) and the response of the building with respect to the action of \( u_2 \) (actuator 2). For comparison, we also studied the scenario where only actuator 2 is attacked using a signal at a frequency where the maximum peak occurs, i.e., 0.70 Hz (see Figure 13). The ISD vs. time in the real plant for both attacks is shown in Figure 12. Figure 14 shows the maximum ISD for both attacks. From these experimental results, it is clear that attacking signal \( u_1 \) is the best decision for an attacker to generate the worst damage in the structure, consistent with the result in Figure 13 obtained from the mathematical model of the building.

- **Figure 15**: A video can be seen at https://youtu.be/vM_n1t92NJg.

To show that our designed attack using Eq. (4) generates the largest impact on the structure, we injected signals on actuator 1 at different frequencies but with the same amplitude. We injected sinusoidal actuation signals at frequencies 1.11 Hz, 1.27 Hz, and 1.43 Hz for comparison and compared them to our predicted optimal attack at 0.68 Hz. Figure 16 shows the results using these test signals. An anonymized video of this comparison can be seen at https://youtu.be/vM_n1t92NJg. We confirm that higher-frequency attacks result in smaller ISDs than our optimal design.

### 6. Attacking a Building with Semi-Active Dampers

To study more realistic scenarios, we use standard models of large-scale structures. This case study involves a benchmark 20-story building (Figure 17) supplied by the Structural Engineer Association of California (SAC) [84]. The structure has magnetorheological (MR) fluid dampers at every story that work as semi-active control devices, and it is modeled as an in-plane lumped-mass shear structure.

- **Masses and Stiffness**:
  - Mass of story 1: 1.126 × 10^6 kg
  - Masses from story 2 to story 19: 1.100 × 10^6 kg
  - Mass of story 20: 1.170 × 10^6 kg
  - Inter-story stiffness:
    - Stories 1 to 5: 862.07 × 10^3 kN/m
    - Stories 6 to 11: 554.17 × 10^3 kN/m
    - Stories 12 to 14: 453.51 × 10^3 kN/m
    - Stories 15 to 17: 291.23 × 10^3 kN/m
    - Stories 18 and 19: 256.46 × 10^3 kN/m
    - Story 20: 171.70 × 10^3 kN/m

- **State Variables**: The state variables of the vector \( x \) are the displacement and velocity of each of the 20 stories of the building. Similarly, since the adversary wants to maximize the ISD, \( z \) in Equation (1) is defined as a vector of the ISD at each floor. The ASCE 7-16 standard states that ISD ratios above 1% can compromise the integrity of the structure.

- **Dynamic Behavior of MR Damper**: The dynamic behavior of the MR damper is based on the Bouc-Wen hysteretic model in parallel with a dashpot added for a nonlinear "roll-off" effect. The force produced by this model is a function of the velocity of the device, an evolutionary variable, a set of parameters controlling the hysteresis, and the command voltage applied to the current driver. The parameters used in this study have a capacity of 1000 kN [103] and are scaled to have this capacity with a maximum voltage of 10 V.

- **Control Algorithm**: The control algorithm for this system consists of an LQR algorithm as the primary controller that determines the command force (\( f_c \)), and a clipped-optimal controller that defines the input voltage to the MR dampers (\( v \)). The latter can be expressed as: \( v = V_{\text{max}} H((f_c - f) f) \), where \( f \) is the force of the MR damper, \( V_{\text{max}} \) is the maximum voltage, and \( H \) is the Heaviside step function.

We used the optimization process in Equation (2) to design a DoS attack on the 20-story building. Figure 18 shows the \( H_2 \) norm and the maximum ISD ratio for all stories when the DoS attack is deployed on \( k \) actuators, from \( k = 1 \) to \( k = 20 \), when the building is under a 0.7 El Centro earthquake [90].

- **Figure 18(a)**: \( H_2 \) norm of the system for each \( k \) attacked actuators.
- **Figure 18(b)**: Maximum ISD ratio for all stories when the attacker has blocked \( k \) signals from the designed DoS attack. The horizontal line indicates the 1% safety level, any ISD above that is dangerous for the building.

Note that disconnecting 12 actuators results in a better attack (higher ISD) than disconnecting all 16. Furthermore, the ISD ratio surpasses the safety limit of 1% after disabling only 5 actuators. This information is crucial because an attacker might not be able to attack every actuator. With the proposed algorithm, an optimal attack can be designed for whatever number of actuators an attacker can affect.

- **Figure 19**: Shows which actuators are disabled by the genetic algorithm for each designed attack. It can be seen that the algorithm effectively targets the most critical actuators to maximize the ISD.
