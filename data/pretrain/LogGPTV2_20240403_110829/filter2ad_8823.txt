## Jackhammer:
One Security vulnerability assessment/management tool to solve all the
security team problems.
## What is Jackhammer?
Jackhammer is a collaboration tool built with an aim of bridging the gap
between Security team vs dev team , QA team and being a facilitator for TPM to
understand and track the quality of the code going into production. It could
do static code analysis and dynamic analysis with inbuilt vulnerability
management capability. It finds security vulnerabilities in the target
applications and it helps security teams to manage the chaos in this new age
of continuous integration and continuous/multiple deployments.
It completely works on RBAC (Role Based Access Control). There are cool
dashboards for individual scans and team scans giving ample flexibility to
collaborate with different teams. It is totally built on pluggable
architecture which can be integrated with any open source/commercial tool.
Jackhammer uses the OWASP pipeline project to run multiple open source and
commercial tools against your code,webapp, mobile app, cms (wordpress),
network.
## Key Features:
  * Provides unified interface to collaborate on findings
  * Scanning (code) can be done for all code management repositories
  * Scheduling of scans based on intervals # daily, weekly, monthly
  * Advanced false positive filtering
  * Publish vulnerabilities to bug tracking systems
  * Keep a tab on statistics and vulnerability trends in your applications
  * Integrates with majority of open source and commercial scanning tools
  * Users and Roles management giving greater control
  * Configurable severity levels on list of findings across the applications
  * Built-in vulnerability status progression
  * Easy to use filters to review targetted sets from tons of vulnerabilities
  * Asynchronous scanning (via sidekiq) that scale
  * Seamless Vulnerability Management
  * Track statistics and graph security trends in your applications
  * Easily integrates with a variety of open source, commercial and custom scanning tools
