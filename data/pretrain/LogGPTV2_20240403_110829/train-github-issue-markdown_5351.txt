### Bug report
In tag 2.0.1 the NavigationToolbar2QT includes an unchecked call to a Qt5
feature:
`pm.setDevicePixelRatio(self.canvas._dpi_ratio)`
https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/v2.0.1/lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_qt5.py#L587-L592
This is strange, b/c it's not there in tag 2.0.0 _and_ it's not there in
master!
I can reproduce this with a simple `plt.plot(np.random.randn(10))`.
`AttributeError: 'PySide.QtGui.QPixmap' object has no attribute
'setDevicePixelRatio'`
Issue goes away when I revert to 2.0.0
