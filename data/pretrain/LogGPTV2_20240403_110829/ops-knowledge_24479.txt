User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题NetBios Name Service requests I'm noticing on MS Network Monitor a ton of NetBios Name Service broadcasts coming from a particular workstation.  When I run netmon on that desktop it cannot resolve the application producing them (but does log them).

First question, is this bad?

Next question, what could be causing this so we can either move it to a server or stop it entirely?

The workstation is Windows XP with no attached printers.  A "ton" is 1 broadcast every 2-5 seconds.

Assistant: I'm not sure how to trace why it's broadcasting, but if you want to disable NetBios on that workstation follow the directions from here:


  
  Click Start, Control Panel, and then click Network Connections.
  Right-click Local Area Connection, and then click Properties from the
  shortcut menu.
  Select Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), and then click the Properties button.
  When the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties dialog box opens,
  click the Advanced button.
  Click the WINS tab.
  Click the Disable NetBIOS Over TCP/IP option.
  Click OK to close the Advanced TCP/IP Settings dialog box.
  Click OK to close the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties dialog
  box
  Click OK to close the Local Area Connections dialog box.
  


The document also might give you some pointers on troubleshooting it.

Edit:  You can disable NetBios, and then see if any of the applications on that workstation break.  Then you'll have another avenue for troubleshooting.

Edit:  You can also user Wireshark to do a packet trace on the NIC of the workstation and find out what it's looking for.
