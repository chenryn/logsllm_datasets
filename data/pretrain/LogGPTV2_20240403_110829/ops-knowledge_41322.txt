User: Exception handling is a very important part of program design. Please give what you think are three important principles of exception handling.
Assistant: 1. Detect and report exceptions as early as possible: During program execution, catch and handle exceptions in time, and avoid exception transmission and missed detection as much as possible to avoid more serious consequences. 2. Handle different types of exceptions separately: Different types of exceptions need to be handled in different ways. Unhandled exceptions need to be recorded and reported, so that programmers can fix the problem. 3. Separation of exception handling and normal processing: exception handling should be a module independent of the core logic of the program, rather than being mixed in the program, which can not only improve the readability of the code, but also avoid affecting the normal logic during the exception handling process implement.
