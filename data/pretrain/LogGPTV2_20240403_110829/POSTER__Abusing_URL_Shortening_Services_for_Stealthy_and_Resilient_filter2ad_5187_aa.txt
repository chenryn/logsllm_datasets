Security Threats of URL Shortening: A User’s Perspective 
Nhien-An Le-Khac and M. Tahar Kechadi 
Abstract—Short  URLs  have  been  used  on  the  Internet  for 
several years now and as time goes by new security threats are 
discovered in relation to their use (e.g. malware, phishing, spam). 
However, although current research in literature has compiled 
addressing  the  security  threats  when  utilizing  such  types  of 
URLs,  no  study  approached  the  assessment  of  user  confidence 
and user awareness regarding short URLs. Thus the aim of this 
paper  is  to  cover  the  existing  knowledge  gap  and  to  compile  a 
baseline assessment on the frequency of use, user confidence and 
user  awareness  when  utilizing  short  URLs.  To  do  so,  we  have 
developed questionnaire connected to the previously mentioned 
aspects  and  which  was  applied  to  one  hundred  persons  of 
various  nationalities  from  within  the  European  Union  with 
various user experiences when it comes to the Internet and short 
URLs. The analysis of the replies received from the participants 
to  the  survey  has  revealed  a  general  awareness  that  there  are 
security  risks  associated  with  short  URLs,  a  tendency  of 
propagation  of  short  URLs  to  other  Internet  services  and 
platforms.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
In a society where the Internet is used more and more in our 
daily lives, there is a need for the information to be delivered 
faster  and  without  restraints.  Information  on  the  Internet  is 
usually included in web pages, multimedia platforms, blogs, 
social  networking  sites  that  are  all  accessible  via  specific 
Uniform  Resource  Locator  (URL).  Currently  some  social 
networking sites as well as other websites pose certain limits 
as  to  the  number  of  characters  which  a  URL  can  include. 
Therefore,  the  need  appeared  for  a  service  which  would 
shorten a URL and deliver it to the user. The shortened URL 
would be just an alternative to the initial URL so that the user 
can access the same information without the restraint of the 
number of characters. 
According  to  Wikipedia  [1],  "URL  shortening  is  a 
technique on the World Wide Web in which a URL may be 
made  substantially  shorter  in  length  and  still  direct  to  the 
required page. This is achieved by using an HTTP Redirect on 
a domain name that is short, which links to the web page that 
has a long URL. This is especially convenient for messaging 
technologies such as Twitter and Identi.ca that severely limit 
the number of characters that may be used in a message. Short 
URLs allow otherwise long web addresses to be referred to in 
a tweet". Another definition of the term short URL can also be 
found in [2]: “URL shortening services are used to replace a 
long “Internet Address” (URL) by a shorter one which usually

does  not  exceed  30  characters.  When  users  request  the 
shortened  URL,  they  are  automatically  redirected  to  the 
original URL.” 
Although the primary aim of URL shortening is to avoid the 
character limit set up by certain web services and platforms 
there are other uses for URL shortening such as to "beautify" a 
link,  to  track  clicks  or  to  disguise  the  underlying  address. 
However,  with

introduced, 
Today,  there  are  constantly  new  threats  uncovered  in 
relation to  short  URLs  and  new  security  risks  identified  for 
users.  Yet,  with  all  the  focus  on  the  risks  in  utilizing  short 
URLs, no study approached the assessment of user confidence 
and  user  awareness  regarding  short  URLs  that  in  turn  can 
prove  effective  in  any  cybercrime  prevention  policy  or 
strategy. 
The aim of this paper is to compile a baseline assessment 
on  the  user  confidence  and  user  awareness  when  utilizing 
short  URLs  following  years  of  implementation  of  these 
services.  This  assessment  may  prove  useful  in  developing 
user  awareness  products  in  relation  to  short  URLs  or 
cybercrime risks prevention material. 
The  rest  of  this  paper  organized  as  follows:  Section  II 
shows the related work of this research area. We present risks 
of  using  shortened  URLs  in  Section  III.  We  describe  our 
adopted  approach  to  evaluate  the  users’  perspective  on 
Security Threats of URL Shortening in Section IV. We show 
our  experiments  and  analysis  in  Section  V.  Finally,  we 
conclude and discuss on future work in Section VI. 
II.   RELATED WORK 
The topic of short URLs has been debated over a number of 
years  as  the  security  risks  associated  with  their  use  poses 
significant  concerns 
the  studies 
undertaken until present time have focused more on the risks 
implied by the use of short URLs rather than user confidence 
or user awareness regarding these shortened links. 
to  users.  Therefore 
In a joint study [3] presented during the Proceedings of the 
2013 International World Wide Web Conference (WWW) by 
researchers  from  the  Polytechnic  University  of  Milan,  Italy 
and the University of California, Santa Barbara, US, the risks 
of using short URLs were evaluated. 
The study analyzed the measures taken by URL shortening 
services  in  preventing  malicious  links  being  shortened, 
focusing  on  spam,  phishing  and  malware.  The  study  also 
included an overview of the risks associated with the use of 
shortened URLs. 
The  research  was  based  on  the  submission  to  URL 
shortening  services  of  a  specific  number  of  URLs  which 
delivered exploits targeted at vulnerabilities in web browsers 
as well as browser plug- ins, URLs associated with phishing 
and  URLs  observed  in  spam  e-mails  with  the  purpose  of 
determining  whether  URL  shortening  services  block  one  or 
more  classes  of  threats.  According  to  the  researchers,  the 
results appeared to be consistent across the URL shortening 
services meaning that the services had implemented measures 
to  detect  malicious  URLs  such  as  blacklisting  malicious 
domains from URL shortening and more real time monitoring 
of what URLs get shortened. 
Although in some cases the shortening of malicious URLs 
was  possible  without  restrictions,  most  of  the  URLs  were 
flagged subsequently as malicious. 
A study [4] compiled in May 2011 by researchers from the 
University of Aachen, Germany further detailed the security 
and  privacy  implications  of  URL  shortening  services.  The 
study  included  an  analysis  of  the  security  and  privacy  risks 
caused  by  the  use  of  URL  shortening  services,  an  analysis 
regarding  the  malicious  behavior,  user  tracking  as  well  as 
leakage of URLs to search engines of the most popular URL 
shortening  services  used  on  Twitter  and  an  analysis  of  the 
spam  detection  performance  for  the  most  popular  URL 
shortening  services.  The  study  also  included  a  new  attack 
scenario  to  enable  SSL-only  circumvention  using  SSLStrip 
and  shortened  URLs.  Following  the  research,  the  results 
yielded  that  none  of  the  most  popular  URL  shortening 
services  at  the  time  displayed  any  malicious  behavior. 
However many of the shortening services were well-prepared 
for user tracking. Another outcome of the research was that by 
enumerating  shortening  services  a  significant  amount  of 
sensitive  or  private  information  could  be  found  and  that 
several shortening services leaked submitted URLs to search 
engines. 
Another study compiled in March 2011 by researchers [5] 
from the Foundation for Research and Technology — Hellas, 
Greece  provided  a  characterization  on  the  usage  of  short 
URLs. The research  was  aimed  at  examining  the  content  to 
which  short  URLs  point  to,  how  they  were  published,  their 
popularity  and  activity  over  time  as  well  as  their  potential 
impact on the performance of the web. Authors used in their 
study two sources of short URLs: collected from a large scale 
crawl  of  shortening  services  and  collected  by  crawling 
Twitter messages. The outcome of the study was highlighted 
in several observations: 
1)  short  URLs  appear  mostly  in  ephemeral  media  with 
profound effects on their popularity, lifetime and access 
patterns; 
2)  a small number of a very large number of hits while the 
majority of short URLs have very limited accesses; 
3)  short  URLs  become  popular  very  fast  which  implies 
spikes in accessing of the links and corresponding traffic 
surges; 
the most popular websites to which short URLs point to 
change slowly over time; 
4) 
5)  URL shortening services are extremely effective in space 
gaining, in more than 90% of the cases, the resulting short 
URL reduced the amount of bytes needed for the URL by 
95%;  however 
imposed  redirection  of  URL 
shortening services increased the web page access times 
by an additional 54%. 
the 
All  the  above  studies  introduce  the  risks  associated  with 
using short URLs and they assess the existing URL shortening 
services  in  terms  of  security  of  browsing  on  the  Internet, 
measures  taken  by  the  administrators  of  URL  shortening 
services,  their  popularity  or  existence  over  time.  These 
studies have been presented since they are representative for 
the approach to focus on studies related to the risks of using 
short URLs. 
However there is no individual study on the assessment of 
user  confidence  or  user  awareness  associated  with  utilizing 
short URLs. Therefore, in our research, we aim to cover the 
gap on the user experience in relation to short URLs and to 
compile a baseline assessment on the frequency of use, user 
confidence and user awareness when utilizing short URLs. In 
this paper, we also include an overview on the risks associated 
to  short  URLs,  which  is  instrumental  in  assessing  the  user 
experience in relation to shot URLs. 
III.  RISKS OF USING SHORTENED URLS 
URL shortening services are popular when it comes down 
to shortening long URLs that have the possibility to break or 
are simply too long to be inserted in e-mails, posts on Social 
Networking websites or blogs. However the disadvantage is 
that  with  these  URL  shortening  services  you  are  no  longer 
able  to  see  directly  where  your  browser  will  be  pointed. 
Shortened URLs could lead to the following security risks: 
1)  sites  which  host  malware,  trojans  and  other  malicious 
programs; 
2)  sites  which  could  exploit  security  risks  in  a  browser  or 
system; 
3)  sites  which  contain  phishing  attempts  and  try  to  steal 
personal information; 
4)  sites  which  contain  phishing  attempts  by  social 
interaction; 
5)  sites which are being used in spam campaigns. 
We  discuss  on  these  risks  more  details  in  the  following 
sub-sections. 
A.  Spam 
Spamming  has  become  increasingly  the  most  lucrative 
activity for hackers. URL shortening services are notorious [6] 
for  being  used  by  spammers  in  an  attempt  to  avoid  having 
their  mail  blocked  by  pointing  at  their  own  domains.  They 
hope  that  by  using  a  well-known,  widely  used,  and  free 
service  that  they  will  be  able  to  avoid  having  their  content 
filtered. 
In  a  report  [7]  issued  in  May  2011  by  Message  Labs, 
evidence turned out that spammers established their own URL 
shortening services. 
According  to  an  article  [8]  from  the  examiner.com, 
following  a  spike  in  spamming  by  using  the  Google 
proprietary  URL  shortening  service  goo.gl,  Facebook  has 
started blocking the shortened URLs. 
B.  Malware 
Previously malware associated domain names were easier to 
identify.  The  malware  associated  URLs  tend  to  make  less 
sense as it is difficult to obtain a domain name which looks 
similar to a legitimate site. Yet, with URL shortening services

you  are  using  a  well-known  and  "safe"  domain.  The 
possibilities are limited for most services to allow users to see 
the destination URL that a shortened URL points to. 
For  Facebook  and  Twitter,  URL  shortening  services  are 
common  and  users  don't  have  second  thoughts  usually  in 
accessing them. E-mail has become a less reliable means for 
phishing  because  of  the  anti-spam  services  involved.  With 
URL  shortening,  it  becomes  easier  because  it  "looks 
legitimate".  It's  a  little  more  than  an  accepted  form  of 
obfuscation. 
An example of URL shortening abuse was presented on the 
MX Lab Blog [9]. 
C.  Phishing 
According to the Global Phishing Survey [10] of semester 
two 2013, phishers continue to use “URL shortening” services 
to  obfuscate  phishing  URLs.  Users  of  those  services  can 
obtain a very short URL to put in their limited  space  posts, 
which  automatically  redirects  the  visitor  to  a  much  longer
