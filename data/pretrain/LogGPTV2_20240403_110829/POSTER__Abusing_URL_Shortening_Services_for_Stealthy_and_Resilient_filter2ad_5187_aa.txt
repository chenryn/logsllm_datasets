## Abstract
URL shortening services have been in use on the Internet for several years, and as their usage has increased, so have the associated security threats, such as malware, phishing, and spam. While existing research has addressed these security risks, no studies have evaluated user confidence and awareness regarding short URLs. This paper aims to fill this gap by providing a baseline assessment of the frequency of use, user confidence, and user awareness when using short URLs. To achieve this, we developed a questionnaire that was administered to one hundred participants from various nationalities within the European Union, with varying levels of internet experience. The analysis of the responses revealed a general awareness of the security risks associated with short URLs, as well as a tendency for these URLs to propagate across different internet services and platforms.

## I. Introduction
In today's increasingly digital society, there is a growing need for information to be delivered quickly and without constraints. Information on the internet is typically accessed via Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) on web pages, multimedia platforms, blogs, and social networking sites. However, some social networking sites and other websites impose character limits on URLs. As a result, URL shortening services have emerged to provide shorter, more manageable URLs that still direct users to the same content.

According to Wikipedia [1], "URL shortening is a technique on the World Wide Web in which a URL may be made substantially shorter in length and still direct to the required page. This is achieved by using an HTTP Redirect on a domain name that is short, which links to the web page that has a long URL. This is especially convenient for messaging technologies such as Twitter and Identi.ca that severely limit the number of characters that may be used in a message. Short URLs allow otherwise long web addresses to be referred to in a tweet."

Another definition from [2] states, "URL shortening services are used to replace a long 'Internet Address' (URL) with a shorter one, usually not exceeding 30 characters. When users request the shortened URL, they are automatically redirected to the original URL."

While the primary purpose of URL shortening is to circumvent character limits, it also serves other purposes, such as beautifying links, tracking clicks, or disguising the underlying address. However, these services can also be abused for malicious activities, including malware distribution, phishing, and spam. Despite the increasing recognition of these security risks, no study has yet assessed user confidence and awareness regarding short URLs. This paper aims to address this gap by compiling a baseline assessment of user confidence and awareness, which can inform future cybercrime prevention policies and strategies.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II reviews related work in this area. Section III discusses the risks associated with using shortened URLs. Section IV describes our approach to evaluating users' perspectives on the security threats of URL shortening. Section V presents our experiments and analysis. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper and discusses future work.

## II. Related Work
The topic of short URLs has been a subject of debate for several years due to the significant security risks they pose to users. Most studies to date have focused on the risks associated with using short URLs rather than on user confidence or awareness.

A joint study [3] presented at the 2013 International World Wide Web Conference (WWW) by researchers from the Polytechnic University of Milan, Italy, and the University of California, Santa Barbara, US, evaluated the risks of using short URLs. The study analyzed the measures taken by URL shortening services to prevent the shortening of malicious links, focusing on spam, phishing, and malware. It also provided an overview of the risks associated with the use of shortened URLs. The research involved submitting a specific number of URLs that delivered exploits, phishing attempts, and spam to determine whether URL shortening services could block these threats. The results showed that most services had implemented measures to detect and block malicious URLs, though some malicious URLs were initially allowed but later flagged.

A study [4] by researchers from the University of Aachen, Germany, detailed the security and privacy implications of URL shortening services. The study analyzed the security and privacy risks, malicious behavior, user tracking, and leakage of URLs to search engines. It also introduced a new attack scenario using SSLStrip and shortened URLs. The findings indicated that while none of the popular URL shortening services displayed malicious behavior, many were well-prepared for user tracking. Additionally, by enumerating shortening services, a significant amount of sensitive or private information could be found, and several services leaked submitted URLs to search engines.

Another study [5] by researchers from the Foundation for Research and Technology â€” Hellas, Greece, characterized the usage of short URLs. The research examined the content, publication, popularity, and activity over time of short URLs. The study used two sources of short URLs: a large-scale crawl of shortening services and Twitter messages. Key observations included:
1. Short URLs are primarily used in ephemeral media, affecting their popularity, lifetime, and access patterns.
2. A small number of short URLs receive a very large number of hits, while the majority have limited access.
3. Short URLs become popular quickly, leading to spikes in traffic.
4. The most popular websites linked by short URLs change slowly over time.
5. URL shortening services are highly effective in reducing URL length, but the redirection increases web page access times.

These studies highlight the risks associated with using short URLs and assess the security measures taken by URL shortening services. However, no individual study has focused on user confidence or awareness. Our research aims to fill this gap by assessing the user experience with short URLs.

## III. Risks of Using Shortened URLs
URL shortening services are popular for condensing long URLs that might break or exceed character limits in emails, social media posts, and blogs. However, the downside is that users cannot directly see where the shortened URL will redirect them. The following are the primary security risks associated with shortened URLs:

1. **Malware and Trojans**: Shortened URLs can lead to sites hosting malware, trojans, and other malicious programs.
2. **Browser Exploits**: These URLs can exploit security vulnerabilities in browsers or systems.
3. **Phishing Attempts**: Shortened URLs can lead to phishing sites that attempt to steal personal information.
4. **Social Engineering Phishing**: These URLs can be used in social engineering attacks to trick users into revealing sensitive information.
5. **Spam Campaigns**: Shortened URLs are often used in spam campaigns to bypass email filters.

### A. Spam
Spamming has become a lucrative activity for hackers. URL shortening services are often used by spammers to avoid having their emails blocked. By using well-known, widely used, and free services, spammers hope to evade content filters. For example, a report [7] by Message Labs in May 2011 found that spammers established their own URL shortening services. Additionally, an article [8] from examiner.com noted that Facebook began blocking Google's goo.gl shortened URLs after a spike in spam activity.

### B. Malware
Previously, identifying malware-associated domain names was easier. However, with URL shortening services, users are directed to a well-known and seemingly "safe" domain. Most services do not allow users to see the destination URL, making it difficult to identify potential threats. On platforms like Facebook and Twitter, users often trust shortened URLs without second thoughts. Email has become less reliable for phishing due to anti-spam services, but URL shortening makes phishing easier because it "looks legitimate." An example of URL shortening abuse was documented on the MX Lab Blog [9].

### C. Phishing
According to the Global Phishing Survey [10] for the second semester of 2013, phishers continue to use URL shortening services to obfuscate phishing URLs. Users can obtain a short URL to fit into limited-space posts, which then redirects visitors to a longer, potentially malicious URL.
