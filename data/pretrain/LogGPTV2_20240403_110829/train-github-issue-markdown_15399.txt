I'm using `unittest` to create tests for my spiders. Internally, I use
`CrawlerRunner` to invoke callbacks.
But every time I launch tests, I get several deprecation warnings.
    /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/scrapy/utils/conf.py:97: DeprecationWarning: The SafeConfigParser class has been renamed to ConfigParser in Python 3.2. This alias will be removed in future versions. Use ConfigParser directly instead.
      cfg = SafeConfigParser()
    /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/scrapy/core/downloader/webclient.py:4: DeprecationWarning: twisted.web.client.HTTPClientFactory was deprecated in Twisted 16.7.0: please use https://pypi.org/project/treq/ or twisted.web.client.Agent instead
      from twisted.web.client import HTTPClientFactory
    /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/scrapy/core/downloader/contextfactory.py:51: DeprecationWarning: Passing method to twisted.internet.ssl.CertificateOptions was deprecated in Twisted 17.1.0. Please use a combination of insecurelyLowerMinimumTo, raiseMinimumTo, and lowerMaximumSecurityTo instead, as Twisted will correctly configure the method.

However, I don't see any of these warning when using any of the `scrapy`
commands.
