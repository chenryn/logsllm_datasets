“We are not as strong as we think we are”
● Rich Mullins
25khz between channels
● pseudorandom pattern
● each channel used equally (avg) by each transmitter
● if 20db of hopping channel 250khz:
– must have at least 25 channels
– average <0.4sec per 10 seconds on one channel
0x4010 – FHSS, the one and only ­ NOT!
●
different technologies:
–
DSSS – Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum
● hops happen more often than bytes (ugh)
● typically requires special PHY layer
–
“FHSS”
● hops occur after a few symbols are transmitted
●
different topologies: (allow for different synch methods)
–
point-to-point (only two endpoints)
–
multiple access systems (couple different options)
● each cell has their own hopping pattern
● each node has own hopping pattern
●
different customers:
–
military has used frequency hopping since Hedy and George submitted the 
patent in 1941.
–
commercial folks (WiFi, Bluetooth, proprietary stuff like power meters)
0x4020 – FHSS intricacies
● what's so hard about FHSS?
– must know or be able to come up with the hopping pattern
