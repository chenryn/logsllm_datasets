### 0x4010 - Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) and Other Technologies

**Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS)**
- **Channel Spacing:** 25 kHz between channels.
- **Hopping Pattern:** Pseudorandom pattern.
- **Channel Usage:** Each channel is used equally, on average, by each transmitter.
- **Example:** If a 20 dB hopping channel has a bandwidth of 250 kHz:
  - At least 25 channels are required.
  - The average time spent on one channel should be less than 0.4 seconds per 10 seconds.

**Other Technologies:**
- **Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS):**
  - **Hopping Frequency:** Hops occur more frequently than bytes.
  - **Implementation:** Typically requires a specialized physical (PHY) layer.

- **FHSS:**
  - **Hopping Frequency:** Hops occur after a few symbols are transmitted.
  - **Topologies:**
    - **Point-to-Point:** Only two endpoints.
    - **Multiple Access Systems:** Several options, including:
      - Each cell has its own hopping pattern.
      - Each node has its own hopping pattern.

**Applications:**
- **Military:** Frequency hopping has been used since Hedy Lamarr and George Antheil submitted the patent in 1941.
- **Commercial:** WiFi, Bluetooth, and proprietary systems like power meters.

### 0x4020 - Intricacies of FHSS

**Challenges in Implementing FHSS:**
- **Pattern Knowledge:** The system must know or be able to generate the hopping pattern.
