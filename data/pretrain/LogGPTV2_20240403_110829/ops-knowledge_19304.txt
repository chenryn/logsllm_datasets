User: I have a specific requirement where I can use only Ansible in my host machine without vagrant.
Two questions associated with it:   

Is it possible to spin up a VM over the host machine with libvirt/KVM as hypervisor using ansible ? I know there is a module called virt in ansible which is capable of doing this. But I could'nt find any real example of how to use this. Appreciate if someone can point me to the example YAML through which I can spin up VM.   
With Ansible, is it possible to run my playbook from python code ? If I am not wrong there is a python API supported by Ansible. But is it possible to give YAML file as input to this API which executes tasks from YAML.
Assistant: Of course - if you have SSH access to it.
Yes, you can run Ansible using its Python API or through command-line call. About passing YAML file - also - yes.
