## Abstract
In this paper, we examine the composability properties of key exchange protocols, focusing on those secure in the prevalent Bellare-Rogaway (BR) model. We demonstrate that BR-secure key exchange protocols can be composed with arbitrary protocols requiring symmetrically distributed keys, provided they meet an additional technical requirement: it must be possible to determine which sessions derive equal keys using only publicly available information.

Our results differ from existing work in that we do not rely on the simulation paradigm, either directly or indirectly. Instead, we use a game-based formalism for both security definitions and composition theorems. This approach avoids several undesirable consequences of simulation-based security notions and enhances applicability to a broader class of protocols. We also provide an abstract formalization of game-based security, which may be of independent interest in other research using game-based formalisms.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
Modern cryptographic security proofs often involve sophisticated reductions based on probabilistic arguments, which can be error-prone and difficult to verify. One effective approach to analyzing complex systems is compositional design and analysis, where the security of a larger system is derived from the security of its individual components. This paper contributes to this line of research by focusing on the composability of one of the most fundamental cryptographic tasks: secure key exchange.

There are two main approaches to capturing the security of protocols:
1. **Simulation-based models** such as the Universal Composition (UC) framework, which offer structured and intuitively appealing means for defining security but can be complex and impose stringent requirements.
2. **Game-based models**, which are less onerous but still provide high levels of security, typically ensuring that derived keys are indistinguishable from random keys.

While game-based models are well-understood for standalone key-exchange protocols, there are no rigorously defined guarantees for their composition with other tasks. Our work fills this gap by providing a composition theorem for key exchange protocols with arbitrary symmetric key protocols.

### 1.2 Summary of Results
#### Abstract Framework for Games
We develop a framework for specifying cryptographic games for two-party protocols. This framework reflects standard definitional ideas in cryptography, particularly those originating from the work of Bellare and Rogaway. In this model, an adversary controls all communication between the parties and interacts with the protocol algorithms through an interface provided by the cryptographic game. The goal of the adversary is to trigger a "bad" event, modeled as a predicate on the complete state of the execution. This abstract way of defining security is flexible enough to generalize most existing game-based security definitions and should be of independent interest.

#### Security of Key Exchange Protocols
The crucial security notion we demand from the key exchange protocol is based on the original proposal of Bellare and Rogaway, as refined by Blake-Wilson et al. for the public-key setting. Their model ensures that an adversary cannot distinguish keys derived via the protocol from random strings. Additionally, they identify local "partner" sessions via matching conversations, ensuring that at most two sessions can have the same matching conversation.

We show how to cast the BR security definition in our abstract framework, maintaining the key-indistinguishability requirement. We use the more general concept of session identifiers introduced by Bellare, Pointcheval, and Rogaway, which are generated during protocol execution and match how real-world protocols define their partners. For example, TLS and SSH both use session identifiers. We require that at most two local sessions agree on the same global session identifier.

#### Public Session Matching
To prove general composability, we introduce an additional technical requirement: the existence of a public session matching algorithm. This algorithm can determine which sessions have derived equal session identifiers using only public information. This requirement is not as restrictive as it might seem, as protocols using matching conversations already satisfy it.

#### Defining Composition
We compose key exchange protocols with arbitrary two-party symmetric key protocols. Given a game \( G_{\text{ke}} \) defining the security of the key exchange protocol \( \text{ke} \), and a game \( G_{\pi} \) defining the security of the symmetric key protocol \( \pi \), we generically define the execution of the composed protocol and a game \( G_{\text{ke};\pi} \) capturing its security. In the composed protocol, each session first runs an instance of the key exchange protocol and then uses the derived key to execute the symmetric key protocol. The game \( G_{\text{ke};\pi} \) allows the adversary to interact with \( \text{ke} \) and \( \pi \) simultaneously. The security requirement on the composition is inherited from \( G_{\pi} \): the adversary wins against the composition if it breaks the symmetric key protocol.

#### Composition Theorem
Our main result is that BR-secure key exchange protocols, for which a session matching algorithm exists, can be securely composed with arbitrary symmetric key protocols. This theorem simplifies the analysis of composed protocols, allowing the reuse of existing security analyses for the key exchange and symmetric key protocols.

We introduce the notion of single session reducibility, which is useful for protocols like secure channels. For such protocols, it suffices to analyze a single session, and security for concurrent execution follows automatically. This reduces the analysis of a composed protocol to a single session analysis of the secure channel protocol and a BR-analysis of the key exchange part.

#### Public Session Matching
We show that if a key exchange protocol is composable with arbitrary symmetric key protocols and security is shown via a specific kind of black-box reduction, then a weak form of a session matching algorithm exists. The public session matching is only required for the key exchange protocol and does not impact the subsequent use of the key.

#### Counterintuitive Considerations
It may seem impossible to provide secure composition of key exchange protocols with arbitrary symmetric key protocols due to potential "misbehavior" in the symmetric key protocol. However, key indistinguishability in the key exchange protocol decouples the two phases, making such concerns invalid. Our theorem formally demonstrates that general composition holds.

### 1.3 Related Work
- **Canetti and Krawczyk** on session-key (SK) security [8, 9] use game-based techniques and provide limited composition with secure channels. Their approach, however, relies on simulation-based frameworks, inheriting associated problems.
- **Shoup** presents a security framework for key exchange similar to the BR model but cast as a simulation-based approach [18]. His model does not allow reasoning about the security of the composed protocol.
- **Datta et al.** [11] use Protocol Compositional Logic [12] to add structure to a game-based formalism. Our work, in contrast, works directly within the game-based framework, avoiding the need for additional logical layers.
