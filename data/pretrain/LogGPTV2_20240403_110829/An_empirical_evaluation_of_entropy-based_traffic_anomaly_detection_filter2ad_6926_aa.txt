ABSTRACT
Entropy-based approaches for anomaly detection are appeal-
ing since they provide more ﬁne-grained insights than tra-
ditional traﬃc volume analysis. While previous work has
demonstrated the beneﬁts of entropy-based anomaly detec-
tion, there has been little eﬀort to comprehensively under-
stand the detection power of using entropy-based analysis of
multiple traﬃc distributions in conjunction with each other.
We consider two classes of distributions: ﬂow-header fea-
tures (IP addresses, ports, and ﬂow-sizes), and behavioral
features (degree distributions measuring the number of dis-
tinct destination/source IPs that each host communicates
with). We observe that the timeseries of entropy values of
the address and port distributions are strongly correlated
with each other and provide very similar anomaly detec-
tion capabilities. The behavioral and ﬂow size distributions
are less correlated and detect incidents that do not show
up as anomalies in the port and address distributions. Fur-
ther analysis using synthetically generated anomalies also
suggests that the port and address distributions have lim-
ited utility in detecting scan and bandwidth ﬂood anomalies.
Based on our analysis, we discuss important implications for
entropy-based anomaly detection.

4, 7, 5, 12, 18]. The goal of such analysis is to capture ﬁne-
grained patterns in traﬃc distributions that simple volume
based metrics cannot identify [10].
Several traﬃc features (e.g., ﬂow size, ports, addresses)
have been suggested as candidates for entropy based anomaly
detection. However, there has been little work in under-
standing the analysis capabilities provided by a set of en-
tropy metrics used in conjunction with one another. For
example, it is unknown whether the diﬀerent features com-
plement each other, or if they detect the same anomalies
and are redundant.
The key results from our measurement study are:
The goal of this paper is to provide a better understanding
of the use of entropy-based methods in anomaly detection.
We consider two types of distributions based on ﬂow-header
features and behavioral features. The ﬂow-header features
are addresses (source and destination), ports (source and
destination), and the ﬂow size distribution (FSD) [10, 5, 9].
The behavioral features are the in and out-degree distribu-
tions (degree of an end-host X is the number of distinct
IP addresses that X communicates with) that capture the
structure of end-host communication patterns.
• Port and address distributions are highly correlated, with
pairwise correlation scores greater than 0.95. The degree
distributions and FSD are weakly correlated with each other
and with the port/address distributions.
• The correlation between the source (destination) port and
source (destination) address distribution arises due to the
nature of the underlying traﬃc patterns. However, the cor-
relations across the source and destination distributions stem
from the uni-directional nature of ﬂow-level measurements
available today.
• The anomalies detected by the port and address distri-
butions overlap signiﬁcantly. In our dataset, almost all the
anomalies detected by these distributions are alpha ﬂows [10].
In contrast, host degree distributions and FSD identify anoma-
lous scan, DoS, and P2P activity that are not detected by
the port and address distributions.
• Experiments with synthetically generated anomalies show
that FSD and the degree distributions detect scanning events
that cannot be detected by the port and address distribu-
tions. For DDoS-style events, port and degree distribu-
tions detect only high-magnitude events that would have
appeared as traﬃc volume anomalies.
These observations have important implications for entropy-
based analysis. First, we should select candidate distribu-
tions with care. While ports and addresses have been com-
monly suggested [10] as good candidates for entropy-based
anomaly detection, our measurements question this ratio-
nale. Our results also suggest a natural approach: select
traﬃc distributions that inherently complement one another
and thus provide diﬀerent views into the underlying traﬃc
structure. Second, we need to move beyond the traditional
uni-directional ﬂow semantics available today (e.g., [14, 16]),
since they can artiﬁcially skew the properties of the under-
lying distributions. Thus, it is prudent for administrators
to use bi-directional ﬂow collection tools whenever possible.
Finally, we discuss how to use the correlations to design a
better anomaly detection system. Our preliminary results
show that using time-series anomaly detection on the corre-
lation scores can expose new anomalies that do not manifest
in the raw time-series.
2. PRELIMINARIES
Datasets: Our primary dataset uses (bi-directional) ﬂow
data [2] captured in February 2005 at Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity. 1 The dataset contains traﬃc to and from tens of
thousands of active IP addresses involving roughly 92 TB of
total traﬃc over 2.5 billion ﬂows. IP addresses in the dataset
were anonymized preserving a one-to-one mapping between
actual and anonymized IP addresses [19]. Application ports
were not anonymized. The traﬃc feature distributions we
study are unchanged by the anonymization.
The dataset is split into ﬁve minute non-overlapping epochs
consisting of ﬂows that completed within the epoch. Each
(bi-directional) ﬂow record consists of source/destination pairs
for the IP address, port, packet count, and byte count. It
also includes the connection time, protocol used, connection
state, and ﬂow direction. However, in some cases the direc-
tionality is not evident from the ﬂow record (e.g., UDP ﬂows,
long-lived TCP ﬂows that extend beyond the ﬂow timeout).
In such cases, we use application port numbers to infer ﬂow
direction.2

We also corroborate speciﬁc parts of our analysis with
Netﬂow [14] data from Internet2, G`EANT, and a (diﬀerent)
university department.
Approach: The entropy of a random variable X is H(X) =
− PN
p(xi) log (p(xi)), where x1, . . . , xN is the range of
values for X, and p(xi) represents the probability that X
takes the value xi.3 We compute the normalized entropy
log(N0) , where N0 is the number
(between zero and one) as
of distinct xi values present in a given measurement epoch.
We study seven empirical traﬃc distributions. Five of
these are obtained from ﬂow-headers: source address, desti-
nation address, source port, destination port, and ﬂow size
distribution measured in packets per ﬂow (FSD). Prior work
on using ﬂow-header features in entropy-based analysis uses
uni-directional ﬂow information (e.g., [14, 16]). Hence, we
explicitly convert each bi-directional ﬂow record [2] into two
uni-directional ﬂows for computing the distributions over the
ﬂow-header features. For each source (destination) address
H
1The router observes all traﬃc between university hosts and
external Internet hosts. It also observes a signiﬁcant fraction
of internal inter-departmental traﬃc
2Rationale: If a host is running a well-known application
service, then it is likely to be the server. Since the client ini-
tiates a connection in client-server transactions, we assume
that the host that does not use the well-known port is the
connection initiator.

(port) xi, we calculate the probability
p(xi) =
Number of pkts with xi as src (dst) address (port)
Total number of pkts
The normalization factor is log(N0), where N0 is the num-
ber of active source (destination) addresses (ports) observed
during the measurement epoch.
The remaining two distributions are based on inter-host
communication behavior. We consider the in- and out-degree
of each active internal IP address inside the network under
consideration (e.g., in our dataset we only consider hosts in-
side the university): these are the only hosts for which we
have a complete view of both incoming and outgoing traﬃc.
For a host X, the out-degree is the number of distinct IP ad-
dresses that X contacts, and the in-degree is the number of
distinct IP addresses that contact X. The degree distribu-
tions are computed using bi-directional ﬂows. For each value
of out-degree (in-degree) xi, we calculate the probability
p(xi) =
Number of hosts with out-degree xi
Total number of hosts
The normalization factor is log(D), where D is the number
of distinct out-degree (in-degree) values observed during the
measurement epoch.
For each measurement epoch, we compute the normalized
entropy for the seven distributions. Let Yij denote the nor-
malized entropy of distribution i (e.g., source address) ob-
served in epoch j, and Yi denote the timeseries of normalized
entropy values for distribution i. Given the Yis, we compute
the pairwise correlation coeﬃcients between every pair of
j Yij Yi(cid:2) j−nYiYi(cid:2)
timeseries vectors Yi and Yi(cid:2) , γ(Yi, Yi(cid:2) ) =
(n−1)σYi
,
where Yi and Yi(cid:2) are the sample means of Yi and Yi(cid:2) , σYi and
σYi(cid:2) are the sample standard deviations of Yi and Yi(cid:2) , and n
is the number of epochs. We also apply timeseries anomaly
detection on each Yi using the wavelet analysis technique
proposed by Barford et al [3].4

3. MEASUREMENT RESULTS
3.1 Correlations in Entropy Timeseries
Table 1 shows the pairwise correlation scores between the
entropy timeseries of diﬀerent distributions. We ﬁnd strong
correlations (> 0.95) between the address and port distri-
butions. The remaining metrics show low or no correlation.
Figure 1 shows the entropy timeseries values over the entire
month-long trace. The visual conﬁrmation of the correla-
tions is just as striking as the values themselves. Addition-
ally, we observe that many of the spikes and deviations in the
timeseries plots are also highly correlated. We will revisit
these anomalies in the subsequent discussions.
To conﬁrm that these results are not an artifact of our
dataset, we perform similar analysis using data from other
Internet2, G`EANT, Georgia
networks and time periods:
Tech, and CMU-2008. All the datasets are large; consist-
ing of over a hundred thousand ﬂows per 5-minute bin, and
span multiple weeks. The Internet2 and G`EANT traces con-
sist of ﬂow data from each of the vantage points (11 and 22
respectively). Table 2 summarizes the average and stan-
dard deviation of the correlation scores among the ports
4We also use a heuristic anomaly detection approach to rule
out biases due to the wavelet analysis [15].
