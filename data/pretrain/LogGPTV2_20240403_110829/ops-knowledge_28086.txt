User: I recently installed HiveMQ on a Ubuntu machine and everything works fine. Being new to Linux( I am more on windows guy) , I am stuck with following question.

I started HiveMQ with command as ./bin/run.sh . A window opens and confirm that HiveMQ is running..Great !!!. I started this with putty and when I close the putty , HiveMQ also stops. How to make HiveMQ run all the time ?.
I am using the HiveMQ for my IoT projects ( raspberry pi). I know to subscribe and publish to HiveMQ broker from python , but what confuses me is , should I be running the python program continuously to make this work ?. Assuming I need to trigger 2+ GPIO on Pi , can I write one program and keep it running  by making it subscribe to 2+ topic for trigger events ?.

Any help is greatly appreciated.
Thanks
Assistant: Start HiveMQ with the following:  ./bin/run.sh &
Yes it is possible to subscribe to two topics from the same application, but you need to create separate subscribers within your python application.
