I recently installed HiveMQ on an Ubuntu machine, and everything seems to be working fine. However, as I am new to Linux (I primarily work with Windows), I have a few questions.

I started HiveMQ using the command `./bin/run.sh`. A window opened, confirming that HiveMQ is running—great! I initiated this process via PuTTY, but when I close PuTTY, HiveMQ also stops. How can I ensure that HiveMQ runs continuously, even if I close the PuTTY session?

I am using HiveMQ for my IoT projects, specifically with a Raspberry Pi. I know how to subscribe to and publish messages to the HiveMQ broker from Python, but I am a bit confused about the following: should I run the Python program continuously to make this work? For example, if I need to trigger two or more GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi, can I write a single Python program that subscribes to multiple topics and keeps running, listening for trigger events?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

**Assistant:**

To ensure that HiveMQ runs continuously, you can start it in the background by appending an ampersand (`&`) to the command, like so:
```sh
./bin/run.sh &
```
This will allow HiveMQ to continue running even after you close the PuTTY session.

Regarding your Python application, yes, it is possible to subscribe to multiple topics from a single Python program. You would need to create separate subscribers within your Python application to handle each topic. This way, your program can continuously listen for trigger events and respond accordingly.

If you have any further questions or need more specific guidance, feel free to ask!
