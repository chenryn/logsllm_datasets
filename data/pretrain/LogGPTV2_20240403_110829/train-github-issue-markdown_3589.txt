    margin
    padding
    padding
        ```
      The challenge says "Change the padding of your green box to match that of your red box."
    Initially the padding of the red box is 20 px and the padding of the green box is 10 px.
    So, we need to change the padding of the green box to 20 px to pass the challenge.
        But when we do so,the Run Tests is not successful. Below the challenge it says "Your green-box class should give elements 20px of padding." . Even though I have changed the padding of green box class to 20px it is still passing it
