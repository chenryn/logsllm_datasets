Question: "A website has implemented CAPTCHA to prevent automated scripts from performing malicious activities. Which of the following scenarios could effectively benefit from the CAPTCHA implementation, and which could present challenges to the website's security?"
 "A": "CAPTCHA can prevent an automated script from creating multiple accounts quickly, but it might not stop a determined attacker using machine learning to solve CAPTCHAs."
 "B": "CAPTCHA can deter casual attackers from spamming a comment section, but may not prevent a DoS attack if the attacker is willing to manually solve each CAPTCHA."
 "C": "CAPTCHA can stop all brute-force attacks on user accounts by requiring a CAPTCHA with each login attempt, ensuring account security."
 "D": "CAPTCHA can challenge users to identify images with boats, but it might not be effective against a botnet that distributes the CAPTCHA solving task across many nodes."
