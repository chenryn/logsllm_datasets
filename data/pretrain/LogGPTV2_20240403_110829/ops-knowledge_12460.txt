User: I need to package my Python application, its dependencies and Python into a single MSI installer. The end result should desirably be:

Python is installed in the standard location
the package and its dependencies are installed in a separate directory (possibly site-packages)
the installation directory should contain the Python uncompressed and a standalone executable is not required
Assistant: My company uses the free InnoSetup tool.  It is a moderately complex program that has tons of flexibility for building installers for windows.  I believe that it creates .exe and not .msi files, however.  InnoSetup is not python specific but we have created an installer for one of our products that installs python along with dependencies to locations specified by the user at install time.
