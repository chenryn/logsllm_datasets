### Proof for Theorem 1

#### Overview of the Proof
The proof for Theorem 1 involves two main steps. First, we establish a reduction from (p, λ, T)-Nakamoto to (k, p, λ, T)-OHIE. Second, we show that the properties of (p, λ, T)-Nakamoto carry over to each individual chain in (k, p, λ, T)-OHIE, and then extend these properties to the Secure Common Blockchain (SCB) in OHIE.

#### Step 1: Reduction from (p, λ, T)-Nakamoto to (k, p, λ, T)-OHIE
Consider any adversary \( A \) for (k, p, λ, T)-OHIE. For any given chain \( i \) (where \( 0 \leq i \leq k-1 \)) in the execution of (k, p, λ, T)-OHIE against \( A \), we will show that there exists an adversary \( A' \) for (p, λ, T)-Nakamoto such that, except with exponentially small probability, the behavior of chain \( i \) in (k, p, λ, T)-OHIE follows the same distribution as the single chain in (p, λ, T)-Nakamoto. This reduction implies that the properties of (p, λ, T)-Nakamoto directly apply to each individual chain in (k, p, λ, T)-OHIE.

#### Step 2: Properties of Individual Chains in (k, p, λ, T)-OHIE
We show that, conditioned on the properties of (p, λ, T)-Nakamoto holding for each individual chain in (k, p, λ, T)-OHIE, the SCB generated in OHIE must satisfy the properties in Theorem 1, except with some exponentially small probability. The reasoning in this step focuses on the rank and next rank values of the blocks.

### Formal Concepts for Reduction

**Definitions:**
- **EXEC(OHIE, k, p, λ, T, A):** The random variable denoting the joint states of all honest nodes and the adversary throughout the entire execution of (k, p, λ, T)-OHIE against \( A \).
- **Chainview\(_i\)(EXEC(OHIE, k, p, λ, T, A)):** The joint state of chain \( i \) on every honest node throughout the execution.
- **EXEC(Nakamoto, p, λ, T, A'):** The random variable denoting the joint states of all honest nodes and the adversary throughout the entire execution of (p, λ, T)-Nakamoto against \( A' \).
- **Chainview(EXEC(Nakamoto, p, λ, T, A')):** The joint state of the single chain on every honest node throughout the execution.

**Variation Distance:**
For two random variables \( X \) and \( Y \) over a finite domain \( Z \), their variation distance is defined as:
\[ \|X - Y\| = \sum_{z \in Z} | \Pr[X = z] - \Pr[Y = z] | \]
If \( X \) and \( Y \) are both parameterized by \( \lambda \), we say that \( X(\lambda) \) is strongly statistically close to \( Y(\lambda) \) if \( \|X - Y\| = \exp(-\Omega(\lambda)) \).

### Reduction Lemma
**Lemma 3:**
For any given \( i \) where \( 0 \leq i \leq k-1 \), and any given adversary \( A \) for (k, p, λ, T)-OHIE, there exists an adversary \( A'_i \) for (p, λ, T)-Nakamoto such that the following two random variables are strongly statistically close:
- **Chainview\(_i\)(EXEC(OHIE, k, p, λ, T, A))**
- **σ\(_{\tau_i}\)(Chainview(EXEC(Nakamoto, p, λ, T, A'_i)))**

Here, \( \tau \) is the randomness in EXEC(Nakamoto, p, λ, T, A'\_i). The mapping \( \sigma\_{\tau_i} \) is a one-to-one mapping from each block \( B' \) in (p, λ, T)-Nakamoto to some block \( \sigma\_{\tau_i}(B') \) in (k, p, λ, T)-OHIE, ensuring:
- \( B' \) is an honest block if and only if \( \sigma\_{\tau_i}(B') \) is an honest block.
- \( B' \) extends from \( A' \) if and only if \( \sigma\_{\tau_i}(B') \) extends from \( \sigma\_{\tau_i}(A') \).

### From Individual Chains to SCB
**Lemma 4:**
If the three properties in Theorem 2 hold for each of the \( k \) chains in (k, p, λ, T)-OHIE, then with probability at least \( 1 - \exp(-\Omega(\lambda)) \), the SCB in OHIE satisfies the consistency and quality-growth properties in Theorem 1.

### Final Proof
Using the lemmas, we can now prove Theorem 1:

**Proof:**
- Set the constant \( c \) in Theorem 1 to be the same as the \( c \) in Theorem 2.
- For any given \( i \) where \( 0 \leq i \leq k-1 \), Lemma 3 and Theorem 2 tell us that for chain \( i \) in (k, p, λ, T)-OHIE, with probability at least \( 1 - \exp(-\Omega(\lambda)) - \exp(-\Omega(T)) - \exp(-\Omega(\lambda)) \), the three properties in Theorem 2 hold for that chain.
- Hence, with probability at least \( 1 - k \cdot \exp(-\Omega(\lambda)) - k \cdot \exp(-\Omega(T)) \), the properties in Theorem 2 hold for all \( k \) chains in (k, p, λ, T)-OHIE.
- The growth and quality properties in Theorem 1 then directly follow.
- Applying Lemma 4 further leads to the consistency and quality-growth properties in Theorem 1.

### Discussion and Comparison
- **Plug-in Alternative Results:**
  Our analysis invokes results from [40], which is one of many works analyzing Nakamoto-style protocols. The proof on OHIE invokes existing guarantees on (p, λ, T)-Nakamoto as a black box, allowing alternative results on (p, λ, T)-Nakamoto to translate directly to OHIE.
- **Quantitative Measures:**
  Theorem 2 (adopted from [40]) has the following measures:
  - \( \frac{1}{c\Delta n} \) is the upper limit on \( p \).
  - \( x = \frac{2T}{pn} \) ticks (growth rate) is the time needed for the chain length to grow by \( T \) blocks.
  - \( y = \frac{1-2fT}{1-fT} \) (quality rate) is the number of honest blocks among every \( T \) consecutive blocks on the chain.

- **Alternative Analyses:**
  Other analyses [17], [18], [24], [26] have obtained alternative results on \( x \) and \( y \) values for (p, λ, T)-Nakamoto. We can plug in these values to obtain alternative results on OHIE.

- **Comparison with Prior Results:**
  OHIE provides the same quantitative guarantees as prior results in terms of \( c \), growth rate, and quality rate. The only difference is in the quality-growth of SCB, where OHIE adds \( k \) times more honest blocks per unit time compared to prior results.

- **Confirmation Latency:**
  Theorem 1 indirectly gives OHIE’s guarantee on transaction confirmation latency. Assuming the properties in Theorem 1 hold with \( 1 - \epsilon \) probability, the confirmation latency is \( \Theta((\log \frac{1}{\epsilon} + \log k)\Delta) \) ticks, which is consistent with other Nakamoto-style protocols.

### Experimental Evaluation
- **Methodology:**
  - Implemented a prototype of OHIE in C++ with around 4,700 lines of code.
  - Used Amazon EC2 instances in 14 cities, each with 8 cores and 1Gbps bandwidth.
  - Conducted macro and micro experiments to evaluate performance and determine internal parameters.
  - Nodes form a P2P overlay, connecting to 8 randomly selected peers, with per-node bandwidth up to 20Mbps.

- **Choosing Block Size and Block Interval:**
  - Micro experiments showed that block propagation delay (BPD) for 20 KB blocks is about 1.7-1.9 seconds.
  - BPD does not significantly increase with network size, even in macro experiments with 50,000 nodes.
  - Chose a block size of 20 KB and set \( p \) to correspond to a block interval of about 10 seconds, sufficient to tolerate \( f = 0.43 \).
