overlaps with that of EasyHits4U. 43–74% of the address space of
smaller autosurf networks is also seen in other exchanges. For the
larger networks, 31% of HitLeap’s space overlaps with that of Jin-
gling.
6.3 Impressions Per Day Estimates
In this section we develop a handle on the number of impressions
these exchanges serve per day. We base our estimates on the daily
number of IP addresses recorded in our logs. However, we note
that two factors can lead to overestimating/underestimating these
numbers: (i) IP address aliasing (the same machine switching IP
addresses), and (ii) multiple machines behind NATs.
We analyzed cookie data recorded in our web logs to potentially
adjust for these two factors. For multiple visits from the same IP
address, we ﬁnd that 85–95% of IP addresses in manual exchanges,
80–85% in basic autosurf, and 20–45% in advanced autosurf re-
turned the same cookie set on the ﬁrst visit. Others request and
return multiple cookies. Investigating this further, we ﬁnd that a
high fraction of the IP addresses in advanced autosurf exchanges
clear cookies after every visit.
Due to the limitation of the cookie data, we report our population
estimates at the granularity of IP addresses. We use these popula-
tion sizes to estimate the total number of impressions the exchanges
serve per day. To this end, we compute the average number of im-
pression requests that our milker bots received on average per day,9
and multiply it by the population size of the exchange. Table 9 lists
the impressions per day estimates. On the lower end, we estimate
that 10Khits serves 173K impressions per day, and on the higher
end Jingling serves on the order of 789 M impressions per day.
7. DISCUSSION
In the previous sections we measured a number of facets of trafﬁc
exchanges. In this section, we attempt to draw plausible inferences
based on what we observed.
7.1 Selection pressure
We ﬁnd evidence of trafﬁc fraud responding to selection pres-
sure. The very existence of exchanges, a tool to disperse the orig-
inating IP addresses of trafﬁc, indicates that advertisers actively
look for fraud; clearly, clicking endlessly from a single IP address
seldom achieves the desired result. The differences between the
free and premium versions of the advanced autosurf tools (shown
in Table 1) largely reﬂect the ability to target certain geographic
locations, and to set custom User-Agent and Referer ﬁelds. There
would be little reason for exchange participants to pay for this func-
tionality if it did not bring meaningful advantage. It seems likely
9Since we milked Jingling at a higher rate, we use the number ob-
tained from running the original bot through the Fiddler proxy, con-
ﬁgured to only allow communication with the exchange.

that these ﬁelds are used by sites to detect fraudulent trafﬁc, and
the ability to vary them will increase proﬁts. The large fraction of
YouTube videos stuck at 301 credited views in Figure 1 strongly
suggests a fraud-detection barrier that blocks a large fraction of the
YouTube-bound trafﬁc from two autosurf networks.
7.2 Manual vs. Autosurf exchanges
A common property of the exchanges is that they facilitate dis-
persion of trafﬁc; indeed the need for dispersion is likely the factor
that has led to their popularity. Beyond this common point, we
found little similarity between the manual and autosurf exchanges.
Table 4 shows that the most popular destinations for trafﬁc from
the autosurf exchanges have ad-bearing properties, and ad-fraud of
some kind dominates their trafﬁc. By contrast, Table 3 shows that
trafﬁc from the manual exchanges is predominantly directed at sites
that advertise afﬁliate programs, other manual trafﬁc exchanges, or
pages advertising goods sold by the participants themselves.
In
other words, pages visited in the manual exchanges appear directed
at luring humans (the exchange participants) to upgrade, join other
exchanges or afﬁliate programs, or purchase products that do not
have mainstream appeal. Our inspection of manual exchange traf-
ﬁc turned up numerous examples of what appear to be implausi-
ble propositions and get-rich-quick schemes. For example, one
site asks $9.99 for a pamphlet explaining how to “run your car on
water.” A number of destinations of the manual exchange trafﬁc
appear to be Ponzi or multi-level marketing schemes. For exam-
ple, at http://imarketingfasttrack.com/ new entrants invest $25 and recruit
four newcomers who do similarly; while participants are promised
an easy $1,700, there is no mention of any product beyond par-
ticipant recruitment. Another, http://www.theleadmagnet.com/, is a viral
email lead-generation tool that offers commissions if members get
others to purchase the tool.
7.3 Monetization
Monetization clearly poses a signiﬁcant problem even if one can
generate volumes of well-dispersed trafﬁc. The direct cash-out pay-
ments offered by the exchanges are low: $0.30 per thousand man-
ual clicks for EasyHits4U, and $0.02 per thousand automated clicks
at eBesucher (though getting paid requires a photo ID, as noted in
Section 4.1). Note that, based on Table 9, this amounts to 2 cents
per machine per day, or $7.30 per machine per year.
For fraudsters, exploiting sites such as YouTube, which offer to
pay for trafﬁc delivered, represents an appealing approach. This
has the beneﬁt of low start-up costs: the fraudster simply sets up a
channel with some content to which they direct the trafﬁc, avoiding
costs associated with registering a domain and hosting. Moreover,
the content does not have to be of a quality sufﬁcient to attract
actual human viewers. If the fraud is discovered and the channel
blocked, one can simply start over by setting up a new channel.
10Figure 1 suggests that services such as YouTube successfully de-
tect a good percentage of inorganic trafﬁc, making it hard to lin-
early translate automatically generated views to money. Perhaps
participants direct trafﬁc to YouTube primarily for increasing view
counts to gain popularity, rather than monetization.
7.4 Lack of sophistication
Some of our data supports the view that many trafﬁc exchange
participants lack technical sophistication and struggle to monetize
their efforts, particularly on the manual exchanges. At ﬁrst sight,
the manual exchanges operate as web trafﬁc brokers, offering free
trafﬁc/advertising in exchange for clicks. The exchange extracts
money from participants via the exchange ratio (i.e., exchanging
clicks at less than a 1–1 ratio so that the excess can be sold) or
monthly fee. But this explanation does not seem satisfactory. A
participant who seeks trafﬁc for their product receives clicks only
from others similarly motivated to sell their products. Since the
average quality of clicks received is the same as those delivered, the
average participant should lose in expectation once the exchange’s
cut is removed, unless outside money enters the exchange.
It is
also hard to believe that cash-out rates of $0.30 per 1,000 clicks
(about $0.05 per hour of clicking) could be a long-term incentive
for participants.
The emphasis on afﬁliate programs and related tools and services
among the exchange ads points to a different explanation. These
ads appear targeted at an unsophisticated user group lured by the
prospect of easy money and a career in “Internet marketing”. This
description may well be representative of a large fraction of the
actual manual exchange users. In this case, the sites advertising
on the exchanges might be receiving quality trafﬁc for their offers
with acceptable conversion rates, even if they buy trafﬁc from the
exchange rather than clicking.
7.5 Revenue estimates
Table 6 gives the prices at which we bought clicks from various
exchanges. The cost per thousand (CPM) ranges from $0.06 at Oto-
hits to $10 at HitSafari. Obviously, the clicks are not all of the same
quality, and some may suit far better than others for a particular pur-
pose. For comparison, we compute the cost of generating clicks if
one rented the cheapest instance of a virtual machine from a cloud
hosting service. A micro-instance from Amazon AWS costs $0.013
per hour [3]; setting such a machine to click twice per minute would
cost $0.013 × 1000/(2 × 60) ≈ $ 0.11 per thousand. Of course
these clicks would offer no IP address dispersion. However, these
clicks can be dispersed by using the free service of one of the auto-
surf exchanges. Thus, we calculate that dispersed clicks can be pro-
duced at about $0.11 per thousand. If one needed the customization
that the premium services offer, then at 2.9AC≈ $3.5 per month the
cost becomes $ (0.013×24×30+3.5)×1000/(30×24×60×2) ≈
$ 0.15 per thousand (i.e., renting the instance for a month at the
hourly rate plus the cost of premium exchange membership). Note
that this is signiﬁcantly lower than several of the auto exchanges
charge; e.g., HitLeap charges $0.44 and Jingling $0.41 per thou-
sand. The fact that dispersed customized clicks can be produced
at signiﬁcantly lower cost than the exchanges charge suggests an
inefﬁcient market. It could be that the exchanges price optimisti-
cally and sell very little at the advertised rates, or it could be that
there are unsophisticated buyers for whom the task of setting up an
AWS instance represents a barrier. Note that the manual exchanges
ask more than 10× more per click. A possible explanation is that
proposed in Sections 7.2 and 7.4: it is the participants themselves
rather than an ad network who are the targets, and sending Ponzi
and get-rich-quick schemes at this population is more proﬁtable on
a per-click basis than sending inorganic trafﬁc to YouTube. Our
measurements (and the requirement to perform a CAPTCHA be-
tween clicks) suggest that a large fraction of trafﬁc on the manual
exchanges is in fact organic.
It is hard to pin down deﬁnitive stable numbers for how much
one can expect to earn from inorganic trafﬁc. Some URL short-
ening sites post their current payout rates: adf.ly pays $3.96,
adfoc.us pays $5.50, and sh.st pays $4.03 per thousand.
YouTube does not post payout rates, and discussion forums seem to
indicate it is a complex function of channel subscribers and number
of “likes” that a video receives; between $0.50 and $4 per thousand
appears to be a commonly mentioned range. (The need for “likes”
and subscribers to help monetize views suggests a market for those
commodities also).
If clicks can be produced at $0.15 per thousand (or bought at
the rates shown in Table 6) and sold for $4 or so per thousand to
URL shortening services, the opportunity is very proﬁtable. At the
two clicks per minute rate this would produce $ (4.03 − −0.15) ×
30 × 24 × 60 × 2/1000 ≈ $ 335.2 proﬁt per machine per month.
It seems very likely however that URL shortening services detect
(and refuse to credit) a large volume of inorganic trafﬁc (e.g., in
its TOU adf.ly forbids publishers from “advertising their adf.ly
URL links directly on any form of trafﬁc exchange/PTC website”,
and other services use similar wording). Equally, even the lower
of YouTube payout rates would appear proﬁtable if detection has
negligible effect. Ethical considerations prevent us from sending
automated trafﬁc to any of these services to probe their detection
rates.
It is thus difﬁcult to estimate the true return on inorganic
trafﬁc. We note, however, that even if only 5% of the inorganic
trafﬁc is credited (≈ $17 per machine per month), the ability to
scale up by adding more machines would still allow healthy returns.
Table 9 gives our estimate of the number of impressions per day
from each of the autosurf exchanges. Again, we caution that the
fraction of exchange trafﬁc that is detected (and thus not credited)
is unknown. Nonetheless it is interesting to get rough ideas of the
economic damage inorganic trafﬁc might be causing. HitLeap, at
150M impressions per day, would cost $66K per day to advertisers
if all exchange participants managed to monetize at $0.44 per thou-
sand impressions (i.e., the rate the exchange charges for clicks as
shown in Table 6). Similarly, the ﬁgures for eBesucher and Jingling
would be $3,230 and $323K respectively. These can be considered
somewhat loose upper bounds.
8. CONCLUSION
We examined several manual and automated trafﬁc exchange ser-
vices, which enable dispersion of trafﬁc origins. We found that
these exchanges range across three orders of magnitude in diver-
sity of IP addresses and impressions served per day, and appear
to differ signiﬁcantly in the monetization strategies of participants.
Our results shed light on a previously poorly understood part of the
trafﬁc and ad-fraud ecosystem.
