**Can Windows drivers be written in Python?**

While it is technically possible to embed a Python interpreter within a Windows driver, it is not a recommended or common practice. Writing drivers in a high-level language like Python can introduce significant challenges and limitations, especially regarding performance, memory management, and real-time requirements. 

Windows drivers typically need to interact directly with hardware and the operating system at a low level, which is better suited for languages like C or C++. These languages provide the necessary control over system resources and performance that is often required for driver development.

In summary, while you might be able to use Python in some capacity, it is generally not advisable. For robust and reliable driver development, it is best to use a language that is more appropriate for the task, such as C or C++.
