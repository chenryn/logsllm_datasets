Threats
 data stealing: we discussed EMV skimming usage for 
magstripe cloning and online usage
 card stealing: Cambridge research shows that stolen cards can 
be used without PIN, hopefully this attack will be fixed
 does state of the art EMV usage really protect against PIN 
harvesting and therefore the use of stolen cards?

Cardholder verification
 the card advertises to the terminal the cardholder verification 
method preference via the CVM List (tag 8E)

CVM List
 the CVM List is nowadays signed on all cards, therefore it is 
believed to be tamper proof
 if the preferred authentication method is Signature (paper), 
Enciphered PIN verified online or Enciphered PIN 
verification by ICC then the PIN is not sent by the terminal 
to the card
 it is believed that only when Plaintext PIN verification 
performed by ICC is present and selected from the CVM List 
the PIN can be harvested by the EMV skimmer

Action Codes
 assuming a scenario with DDA only cards and a “secure” CVM 
List can we still harvest the PIN ?
 Issuer Action Codes (card) and Terminal Action Codes 
(terminal) specify policies for accepting or rejecting 
transactions (using TVR specifications)
 Issuer Action Codes and Terminal Action Codes are OR'ed
 three kinds: Denial, Online, Default; the Online Action Codes 
specify which failure conditions trigger online transactions

Action Codes Example
  9f0e Issuer Action Code - Denial  (5 bytes): 00 00 00 00 00
  9f0f Issuer Action Code - Online  (5 bytes): f0 78 fc f8 00
  9f0d Issuer Action Code – Default (5 bytes): f0 78 fc a0 00
 translation: “do not deny a transaction without attempting to 
go online, if offline SDA fails transmit the transaction online”
 in all tested terminals / cards we were able to manipulate the 
action codes (when necessary) so that tampering with the 
CVM List would not result in offline rejection

CVM List downgrade
 the modified CVM List is honoured by the terminal which 
means that Plaintext PIN verification performed by ICC can 
be presented enabling PIN harvesting for SDA/DDA cards

Backend detection
 the attack execution might be detected by the backend (via 
the TVR, CVM Results and CVR advertising failed data 
authentication and cleartext CVM) but blocking a card solely 
on this information does not feel like a realistic solution
 a downgraded CVM List with offline PIN + fallback to online 
PIN might be used to “hide” cleartext CVM Results and CVR by 
answering incorrect PIN offline verification to the terminal 
(without passing the command to the card), customer would 
be prompted twice for the PIN

Backend detection
 (untested) it would be also possible for the skimmer to advertise 
relevant offline authentication records from a stored valid SDA card 
with a convenient CVM List for the authentication phase, and use 
the real card for the transaction, this would result in “clean” TVR, 
CVM Results and CVR
 Terminal Capabilities (9f33), when requested by the card via 
CDOL1/CDOL2 and sent by the terminal via GENERATE AC, can be 
intercepted and rewritten to advertise only SDA capability in case of 
DDA card skimming
 CDA is designed to protect against this but it should still be 
possible for the skimmer to force usage as an SDA card

Summary
 an EMV skimmer poses a serious threat due to ease of 
installation and difficult detection
 EMV data allows fraudulent usage on websites that perform 
insufficient validation (as well as magstripe clone for cards that 
do not use iCVV)
 the PIN can be always intercepted despite card type (SDA or 
DDA) and CVM / Issuer Action Codes configuration
 stealing an EMV chip & pin card that was previously skimmed 
enables full usage and raises serious liability considerations

Vendor Response
 EMVCo announced that the hole will not be fixed saying that 
“when the full payment process is taken into account, suitable 
countermeasures are available”
 MasterCard spokesman Jan Lundequist (head of chip product 
management) said in an interview that the EMV system is 
simply too complex for an easy fix
 In the Netherlands the hole has been reportedly closed by 
updating POS firmware with a version which apparently 
disables plaintext PIN verification for domestic cards (believed 
to be 100% DDA)

Recommendations
 despite industry claims about reduced fraud levels in our 
opinion EMV is inadequate and overly complex, it should be 
replaced with a simpler and cleaner solution
 correctly implemented crypto should be performed between 
card <> backend (online) or card <> terminal (offline) for 
double authentication and preventing interception/man-in-
the-middle attacks for every single step of the transaction
 terminals cannot be trusted, PIN input and verification should 
be confined on the card itself (e-ink scrambled touchpad)
 Copyright 2011 Inverse Path S.r.l.
Chip & PIN is definitely broken ­ v1.4
Recommendations
 “patching” EMV is possible by disabling plaintext PIN 
verification on POS and ATM firmwares preventing the 
downgrade attack
 despite some vendor response claiming otherwise this would 
play nicely with every card type as on-line PIN verification can 
be used for SDA
 actually on-line PIN verification could be used all the time, 
both North America and European banks have reportedly little 
use for the whole off-line verification mess pushed by EMV 
and could do everything on-line...
