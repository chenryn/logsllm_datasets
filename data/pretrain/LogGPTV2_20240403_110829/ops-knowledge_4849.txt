User: I'm using Celery (2.2.4) with Redis (v.2.2.2) as my message broker. 
Any idea what would cause SOME (most) messages to randomly and inconsistently get lost?
Assistant: The only reason that seems logical is that you exceed the memory that your redis-instance uses. So some messages are discarded ( with LRU policy (?) ).
