### AppComponent Template
- **Chat Notification Component**: This component should be placed here.
- **Chat Display Component**: This component should be placed in this section.
- **Other Chat Notification Component**: This component should be placed here.
- **Other Chat Display Component**: This component should be placed in this section.

### Tabs Component Template
**UPDATE**: The following is the `tab-link` template, which I forgot to include in the initial post.

### TabLink Component (TypeScript)
```typescript
export class TabLink {
  @Output('tabSwitch') tabSelected: EventEmitter<TabLink> = new EventEmitter<TabLink>();

  select() {
    this.tabSelected.emit(this);
    console.log('Tab link clicked');
  }
}
```

### Tabs Component (TypeScript)
```typescript
export class Tabs {
  setActiveTab(link: TabLink): void {
    console.log("Setting active tab:", link);
  }
}
```

### Issue Description
I expect the `setActiveTab` method to be triggered when I click on a `TabLink`, but it does not seem to be working. I have tried moving the `tabSwitch` event listener around, but nothing seems to work.

### Additional Information
- The `select` method in the `TabLink` component emits the `tabSwitch` event, which should be listened to by the `Tabs` component.
- The `setActiveTab` method in the `Tabs` component is supposed to handle the emitted event and set the active tab accordingly.

### Request for Assistance
Any suggestions or insights into why the `setActiveTab` method is not being called would be greatly appreciated.
