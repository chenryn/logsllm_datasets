Hi,  
sorry if this is the wrong place to ask for this.
It is really awesome that VS Code is now open-source. Some time ago I created
a issue in the TypeScript repo (microsoft/TypeScript#5324) asking if it'd be
possible to embed the Monaco Editor (as used in the TypeScript Playground)
into your own HTML pages.
I'd like to:
  * Show the Monaco editor in the HTML page using the Typescript Language Service.
  * Specify the initial TypeScript editor contents and my own .d.ts definition files to be used by the TS Language Service.
  * Get the displayed TypeScript and the transpiled Javascript when e.g. a button is clicked.
  * Be able to dispose of the editor when e.g. another button is clicked.
So I'd like to use the editor similar to the Typescript Playground, with the
difference that I would specify my own .d.ts files and to not have a
JavaScript editor at the right-hand side.  
However I don't know how to do this correctly.
I checked out the vscode repository and invoked tsc in the src folder. Then I
created a HTML page in that folder using the TS playground as a template:
    Test Monaco
However, when hosting the directory in IIS Express and opening the HTML file
in a browser, I'm getting errors such as
    GET 
    http://localhost:8080/vs/editor/contrib/comment/common/color.css [HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found 16ms]
    GET 
    http://localhost:8080/vs/editor/contrib/inPlaceReplace/common/gotoError.css [HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found 13ms]
    GET 
    http://localhost:8080/vs/editor/contrib/referenceSearch/browser/rename.css [HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found 125ms]
    TypeError: Browser.isInWebWorker is not a function browserService.js:25:17
    TypeError: nls.localize is not a function pluginsRegistry.js:330:30
    TypeError: EditorCommon.LineTokensBinaryEncoding is undefined tokenIterator.js:7:9
Can anybody give me some pointers how to embed the editor correctly using the
TS service?
Thank you!
