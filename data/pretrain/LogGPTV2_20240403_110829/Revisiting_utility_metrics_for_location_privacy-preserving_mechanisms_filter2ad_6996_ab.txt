Geo-indistinguishability to devise an alternate privacy metric to
improve the trade-offs; evaluation of all metrics is using the generic
QL metrics. Pham et al. [22, 23] consider privacy of different players
in ride hailing services and propose PrivateRide - a new protocol
that provides security and privacy guarantees based on established
cryptographic paradigms. However, the work neither evaluates
PrivateRide in terms of QL due to cloaking LPPM nor analyzes
trade-offs of privacy-QL.
Table 1 summarizes the privacy and QL metrics proposed in the
past. We see that the majority of QL metrics are distance-based
only, presumably to facilitate problem formulation and make the
analysis of optimal algorithms tractable [20].
3 PRELIMINARIES
We start by introducing preliminaries on the main concepts used
across the paper.
3.1 Ride-hailing Services
A ride-hailing service (RHS) has three main players: riders, drivers,
and a service provider (server). The server collects and manages all
of the data of riders and drivers, and is responsible for matching
riders to nearby drivers, calculating ride fares to charge riders and
fascilitating payments to drivers. Using RHS mobile application,
a rider sends a requests to the server which contains her location
and reputation. Then the server searches for drivers nearby the
rider’s location and sends a request to the nearest available driver
using the RHS driver application. This request contains the rider’s
location, reputation, and surge around the rider’s location. If a
driver rejects the request, it is sent to the next available driver.
Once a request is accepted, driver details are sent to the rider and
she chooses to accept or reject the driver. If accepted, the rider and
driver collaborate on pick up. At any time, if the driver rejects a ride
request, a penalty in terms of money or reputation is imposed. Note
that the details of such interactions may differ across in-the-wild
RHSes.
3.2 Utility (Quality Loss) Metrics
A quality loss (QL) metric quantifies the utility degradation of
an LBS due to the use of LPPMs. The expected QL is formulated
as [1, 5, 28]:
(cid:88)
lr ∈X
lo ∈Z
ˆQL(LPPM, π , dQ ) =
π (lr ) · LPPM(lr )(lo ) · dQ (lr , lo )
(1)
where π (lr ) is locations’ prior distribution, LPPM : X → Z is the
LPPM and, lr and lo are the real and obfuscated locations, respec-
tively. LPPM(lr )(lo ) denotes the probability of obfuscating lr to
lo.
dQ (lr , lo ) quantifies the QL metric for a single LBS access, and
ˆQL quantifies the expected loss over X,Z. Prior works mainly use
distance-based measures to define dQ (lr , lo ), i.e., generic metrics. In
this work, we argue to tailor the definition of dQ (lr , lo ) to specific
applications.
3.2.1 Generic QL Metric. The generic QL metric models dQ (lr , lo )
as a function only of the obfuscation distance, i.e., Euclidean dis-
tance between lr and lo: dQ : X,Z → R. The majority of previous
works use this metric to simplify formulation and analysis. The
average Euclidean and average squared Euclidean distances are
the most commonly used metrics [1, 5, 6, 26, 28] for dQ (lr , lo ). We
denote Euclidean distance as QLg in the rest of the paper; in case of
geolocation coordinates, one can replace Euclidean with Haversine
distance [29].
3.2.2 Tailored QL Metrics. A Tailored QL metric aims to capture
the QL perceived by LBS users in the wild. Such metrics are not well
studied in the literature due to their complexity, highly subjective
nature, and consequent non-tractability. For instance, for a fitness
LBS the calories burnt during an activity is one of the tailored QL
metrics. Calories burnt captures speed, elevation, heart rate, and
basal metabolic rate etc. [14] of the users. Hence, the tailored QL
is a function of all the attributes listed above, instead of obfusca-
tion distance only. Similarly, for RHSes the ride completion time
and/or ride fares can be the tailored QL metrics. We note that, it is
hard to formalize these metrics; nevertheless, as we systematically
demonstrate, tailored QL metrics are important for LPPM design,
and for better user-experience LBSes can devise them using the
comprehensive QL notion we propose.
3.3 Geo-indistinguishability and Location
Privacy Preserving Mechanisms
We use geo-indistinguishability [1] in our experiments as the pri-
vacy metric. Geo-indistinguishability, derived from differential pri-
vacy, formalizes privacy guarantees for location sensitive data.
Suppose X,Z ⊆ R2 are the domains of real and obfuscated lo-
cations, and P (Z) is the set of probability distributions over Z.
LPPM : X → P (Z) provides Geo-indistinguishability if:
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) LPPM(lr )(lo )
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ ϵd(lr , l
′
r )
ln
LPPM(l′
In (2), we assume that ln( x
(2)
r )(lo )
y ) is 0 if both x,y are 0 and ∞ if one
of them is 0. d(lr , l′
r ) is an arbitrary distance function, and ϵ is the
privacy budget. An LPPM provides (ℓ, r )-geo-indistinguishability, if
it provides an ℓ level of privacy within radius r of the actual location;
this is achieved by setting ϵ = ℓ/r in (2). Geo-indistinguishability
ensures that an LPPM obfuscates both the locations lr and l′
r to lo
with near equal probabilities, making it difficult for an adversary to
reverse-engineer the real location among lr and l′
r after observing
lo.
In our evaluations, we use three state-of-the-art LPPMs with
geo-indistinguishability guarantees: Planar Laplace (LPPMp), Geo-
metric (LPPMд), and Exponential (LPPMe) mechanisms [1, 5]. We
consider a 10Km × 10Km region for all of our experiments. As the
considered region is finite, we employ truncated versions of the
planar Laplace and geometric mechanisms. In all our experiments,
d (.) is Euclidean distance; LPPMp incurs average Euclidean loss
of 2/ϵ, but due to the truncation, the loss incurred is less than 2/ϵ
in our experiments for small ϵ values. For the probability mass
function of the three LPPMs and implementation details, we refer
the reader to [5].
4 PRIDE: A PRIVACY-PRESERVING RHS
To demonstrate the impact of tailored and generic utility metrics on
design and evaluation of LPPMs, we choose ride-hailing services
due to the complex nature of their perceived utility. We introduce a
privacy-preserving RHS instance PRide which uses the state-of-the-
art privacy mechanisms (§ 3.3) to preserve privacy of RHS drivers
and riders.
4.1 Threat Model and Privacy Guarantees
We consider the PRide server to be adversarial, who tries to learn
locations of riders. The server has some prior information about the
distribution of rider’s true locations and uses posterior information
from each ride to infer the rider’s true locations. The posterior
information includes the rider’s hailing location and the locations
of drivers around it, the location of the matched driver, and the ride
Figure 1: A common PRide scenario described in Section 4.3.
destination. We assume all of the locations in the posterior infor-
mation are obfuscated using geo-indistinguishability mechanisms,
and below, analyze the corresponding privacy protection to riders.
The specifics of obfuscations in PRide are as follows: 1) drivers’
locations used for ride matching are obfuscated using a constant
privacy budget ϵ1, 2) drivers report only the pick-up and destina-
tion locations of a ride to the server; pick-up location is the rider’s
obfuscated location lo which spends ϵr budget and destinations
are obfuscated by the rider using budget ϵ2. In essence, all the
posterior information is obfuscated and prevents the server from in-
ferring true locations of riders. Therefore, by obfuscating locations
in this way, riders achieve (ϵr + ϵ1 + ϵ2)-geo-indistinguishability
due to composability [9]. Hence, using ϵr privacy budget, riders
can achieve privacy linear in ϵr .
Note that our work aims to thoroughly investigate the effects
of tailored versus generic QL metrics. Therefore, to abstract from
PRide’s privacy analysis, we make the following assumptions. First,
drivers’ locations can be obfuscated to achieve any desired distribution
of drivers. For instance, we assume that uniform distribution of
drivers can be achieved after obfuscation. This assumption allows
us to obfuscate only the riders’ locations in the rest of the paper.
Second, along with drivers’ location obfuscation, out-of-band secure
channels between riders and drivers, and anonymous payments
are used by PRide [22, 23] for riders to achieve the above-specified
geo-indistinguishability. This assumption allows us to abstract from
the detailed privacy analysis of PRide protocol and focus on QL
quantifications when only riders obfuscate their locations.
4.2 Notations
We clarify some notations below. The expected time of arrival ETA
is calculated for a combination of the hailing location of rider wrt

(with respect to) server and the pickup location of the rider with
respect to driver. Either lr or lo can be used to hail a ride and is called
a hailing location. If a ride request sends lr to a driver, it is called
REAL_REQ and if it sends lo, it is called OBF_REQ. Specifically,
if lr is used to hail a ride, the only pickup location for the driver
is lr ; this is denoted as ETAr
r i.e., hailing and pickup locations are
both lr (row 1 in Table 3). However, to preserve privacy, PRide hails
a ride using lo i.e., the rider first releases only lo and all drivers
see ETA to lo (row 2 in Table 3) which is denoted as ETAo
o i.e., the
hailing location is lo and the pickup location is lo.1 If some driver
accepts this request, then, only to that driver, the rider releases her
lr i.e., the hailing location is lo but the pickup location is lr hence
corresponding ETA is ETAo
r (row 3 in Table 3). All of the notations
are summarized in Table 2 and 3.
Table 3: PRide request types. In no-privacy case (row-1), only
the REAL_REQ is sent. In privacy preserving (row-2+3) case,
OBF_REQ is sent followed by the REAL_REQ. In row-2, the
rider does not send anything to any specific driver but in
row-3, the rider sends lr , through a out-of-band secure chan-
nel, to the driver who accepts the OBF_REQ. R,D,S are rider,
driver and server respectively.

4.3 The PRide Protocol
In PRide, a rider first uses obfuscated location, lo, to send obfuscated
ride request, OBF_REQ, and only when some driver accepts the
OBF_REQ, the rider reveals her real location, lr using REAL_REQ
through some secure channel. RHS applications allow drivers to see
only the ETA to rider’s hailing location. Therefore, drivers first see
o, and then see ETA to real location,

minimum acceptance policies [8, 15] in RHSes do not allow drivers
to cancel the accepted rides very often. Sequence diagram in Fig. 1
demonstrates the following scenario common in PRide (and in any
RHS):
• Rider obfuscates lr to lo and sends OBF_REQ; she may have
to resend the request due to unavailability of drivers around
lo (the hailing location).
• Server finds drivers within search radius and forwards the
OBF_REQ to nearest driver.
• A driver accepts OBF_REQ based on ETAo
REAL_REQ due to high ETAo
quest to drivers multiple times.
• Subsequently, some driver accepts both OBF_REQ and
REAL_REQ based on her Md (§ 5.1.2).
4.4 Tailored QL Metric for PRide
In this section, we formalize the tailored QL, QLt (lr , lo )2, used in
our evaluations: Difference in time to complete a ride when hailing
location is real versus obfuscated. We ignore the non-quantifiable
factors such as behavior of drivers as they do not change with
obfuscation and cannot affect design and/or evaluation of LPPMs.
Modeling QLt analytically is difficult; however, RHSE (§ 5) can
