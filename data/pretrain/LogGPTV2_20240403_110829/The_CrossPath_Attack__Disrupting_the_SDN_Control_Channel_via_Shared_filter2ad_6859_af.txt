shared links with control paths.
Attacks on SDN and Related Defenses. SE-Floodlight [48]
and SDNShield [63] are developed to provide permission
control for malicious SDN applications. Some studies fo-
cus on the security of controllers, including network poison-
ing [31], identiﬁer binding attacks [35], subverting SDN con-
trollers [49], and exploiting harmful race conditions in SDN
controllers [65]. Other studies focus on data plane security,
including low-rate ﬂow table overﬂow attacks [22], SDN
teleportation, and detection on abnormal data plane [51].
Our paper focuses on the security of control channel, which
is orthogonal to the existing work. Particularly, we uncover
a new type of attack, which has not been discovered by ex-
isting automatic attack discovery tools [34, 43, 59] in SDN.
The packet in ﬂooding attack [55, 60] is mostly closest to

of packet in messages. To trigger the control messages, the
attack requires generating massive bogus packets matching
no rules in switches. Different from it, our attack generates
low-rate data trafﬁc to implicitly disrupt control trafﬁc in the
shared links instead of directly generating massive control
trafﬁc. Our attack can bypass the previous defenses [55, 60,
52, 27] against packet in ﬂooding attacks since they detect
attacks by identifying and throttling malicious control trafﬁc.
LDoS Attacks in Traditional IP Networks. Kuzmanovic
et al. [41] developed low-rate TCP-targeted DoS attacks to
disrupt TCP connections. Zhang et al. [66] demonstrated
the attack has severe impact on the Border Gateway Pro-
tocol (BGP) by conducting real experiments. Schuchard et
al. [50] extended the attack developed by Zhang et al. and
designed the Coordinated Cross Plane Session Termination
attack (CXPST) that allows an attacker to attack the Internet
control plane by using only data trafﬁc. Our attack differs
from the previous work in three aspects. First, our attack
focuses on disrupting the SDN control channel that shares
a limited number of links with data paths. Second, probing
techniques are required in the attack to identify target data
paths containing shared links, which is necessary to ensure
the effectiveness of the attack. Third, our attack in SDN has
more signiﬁcant impacts on diversiﬁed network functionali-
ties including layer 2, 3 and 4 functions.
To defend against LDoS, some countermeasures have
been provided in traditional IP networks, such as random-
izing RTO [42] and complex signal analysis [58, 53, 23, 64,
46, 24] . However, randomizing RTO cannot fully mitigate
the attack [66], and none of the methods are shown to be
sufﬁciently accurate and scalable for deployment in real net-
works. Besides, they are general defenses against LDoS in
traditional IP networks and are not designed to protect the
SDN control channel. Defenses against LDoS attacks on
BGP was described in [50], such as BGP Graceful Restart.
However, it is not suitable to protect the SDN control channel
with “dumb” SDN switches.
Link Flooding Attacks in Traditional IP Networks.
Studer et al. [38] and Kang et al. [57] introduced link ﬂood-
ing attacks, which generate large-scale legitimate low-speed
ﬂows to ﬂood and congest network critical links. They use
traceroute to ﬁnd critical links in traditional IP networks.
Our crosspath attack also congests the critical links that de-
liver control trafﬁc and data trafﬁc in SDN at the same time.
However, one major difference is that our crosspath attack
USENIX Association
28th USENIX Security Symposium    31
identiﬁes the critical links with the unique SDN reconnais-
sance technique. Moreover, the crosspath attack can incur
various damages in the whole network by disrupting the con-
trol channel due to the centralized control in SDN. Though
there exist some SDN defense systems [67, 61, 62, 37] that
detect link ﬂooding attacks, they cannot defend the crosspath
attack that disrupts the control channel, which these SDN de-
fense systems depend on.
8 Conclusions
In this paper, we present a novel attack in SDN. It disrupts
the control channel by crafting data trafﬁc to implicitly in-
terfere with control trafﬁc in the shared links. We develop
the adversarial path reconnaissance to ﬁnd a target data path
containing shared links for the attack. Both theoretic anal-
ysis and experimental results show that our reconnaissance
works in real networks. We demonstrate that the attack can
signiﬁcantly disrupt various network functionalities in SDN.
We hope this work attract more attention to SDN security,
especially the possible attacks on the SDN control channel
when deploying SDN to innovate network applications.
