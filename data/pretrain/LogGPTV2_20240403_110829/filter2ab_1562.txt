To mitigate the risks associated with unauthorized or malicious applications, system settings can be configured to prevent the execution of applications that have not been downloaded from the Apple App Store. Additionally, restricting the execution of unsigned applications can further reduce potential security threats. These measures help ensure that only trusted and verified software is allowed to run on the system.
