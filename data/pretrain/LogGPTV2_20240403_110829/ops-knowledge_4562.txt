User: How to achieve high availability in a cloud-based environment? Please list at least two options with their pros and cons.
Assistant: Solution 1: Using a load balancer Advantages: 1. Improve the availability of the application system and distribute requests to multiple servers. Even if one of the servers fails, it will not affect the user's request response; 2. Improve the performance of the system, Load balancing can distribute requests to servers with lower loads according to different load conditions, thereby improving the response speed of the system. Disadvantages: 1. In order to achieve high availability, at least two servers are required, which will increase the complexity of deployment and operation and maintenance; 2. If the load balancing itself fails, the entire system will be unavailable, so backup and fault tolerance processing is required. Solution 2: Use containerization technology Advantages: 1. Convenient and fast deployment and maintenance, you can quickly build multiple servers for application deployment; 2. Improve the portability of applications so that applications can run in different environments . Disadvantages: 1. The application needs to be decomposed and adapted, and split into multiple microservices, which increases development difficulty and management costs; 2. The load capacity of a single-node container is limited and cannot meet high-load scenarios. Consider adopting technologies such as load balancing and automatic expansion to improve availability.
