**Title: Botconf2020: Global Threat Hunting - Predicting Attacks at the Preparation Stage**

During my research at Group-IB on the activities of hacking groups, I observed that certain trojan families consistently use specific templates in their communication processes and in the infrastructure they employ for attacks. The key to predicting these attacks lies in identifying these templates and using them to anticipate threats at the initial stage, when threat actors are setting up their infrastructure.

To achieve this, the following information needs to be analyzed:

- Opened ports
- Available services on these ports (service fingerprints)
- Responses from the opened ports
- SSL certificates associated with the opened ports

By processing this data, it is possible to predict attacks even before they are executed. This type of intelligence is more valuable than information gathered post-attack, as it allows for proactive defense measures.
