User:  When starting a certain service, it prompts "space is full", but there is still free space when checking with df -h and df -i, how to solve it
Assistant: 1. lsof|grep delete can see that there are files (such as big.log) in the deleted state. Solution 1: Restart the service that occupies the changed file. Solution 2: If the service cannot be restarted, then cat /dev/null >big.log solution Three: > big.log (but this method is not universal in some shells)
