User: I want to run this command from python:
gs.exe -sDEVICE=jpeg -dTextAlphaBits=4 -r300 -o a.jpg a.pdf
Using ghostscript, to convert pdf to series of images. How do I use the RAM for the input and output files? Is there something like StringIO that gives you a file path?
I noticed there's a python ghostscript library, but it does not seem to give much more over the command line
Assistant: You can't use RAM for the input and output file using the Ghostscript demo code, it doesn't support it. You can pipe input from stdin and out to stdout but that's it for the standard code.
You can use the Ghostscript API to feed data from any source, and you can write your own device (or co-opt the display device) to have the page buffer (which is what the input is rendered to) made available elsewhere. Provided you have enough memory to hold the entire page of course.
Doing that will require you to write code to interface with the Ghostscript shared object or DLL of course. Possibly the Python library does this, I wouldn't know not being a Python developer.
I suspect that the pointer from John Coleman is sufficient for your needs though.
