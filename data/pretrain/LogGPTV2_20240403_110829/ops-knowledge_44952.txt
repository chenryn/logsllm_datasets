User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题TokuDB storage engine missing after restart I'm using MariaDB-server 10.0.14 and just had a power outage and hard restart. When coming back up I had to manually remount drives etc. but everything seems intact except I have an error when trying to access a TokuDB table with 'Unknown storage engine 'TokuDB'.

Any clue how this could come about?

Assistant: Assuming TokuDB is enabled in your config (which it would have been in the first place in order to be using it), I'd check the Maria/MySQL logs for a TokuDB startup error.  Hugepages is often enabled by default on CentOS and TokuDB doesn't like that - but it does complain loudly in the log.  I'd suspect something like that.
