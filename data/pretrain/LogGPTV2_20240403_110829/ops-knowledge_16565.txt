User: Am I understand correctly, that multiprocessing.freeze_support() need only to compile .py script to .exe in windows? Or is it used in other things?
Assistant: Yes, you understand correctly.
According to documentation, this method only needed to maintain the multiprocessing module in working condition under frozen exe under Windows.
