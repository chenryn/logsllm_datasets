**Glide Version**: 4.11  
**Integration Libraries**: None  
**Device/Android Version**: Xiaomi Mi6, Android 9

### Issue Details / Reproduction Steps / Use Case Background
I am attempting to load images from compressed files (e.g., ZIP archives). According to the `ModelLoader` documentation, Glide provides image decoders for two types of data by default: `InputStream` and `ByteBuffer`. Therefore, I assumed that I would not need to add a custom `ModelLoader` if I could obtain an `InputStream` from the compressed file.

To achieve this, I created a custom `InputStream` class called `ZipFileInputStream`, which is a subclass of `InputStream`. However, when I pass this `InputStream` to Glide, it does not recognize it as a valid `InputStream`.

### Glide Load Line / `GlideModule` (if any) / List Adapter Code (if any)
In the fragment, I initialize Glide as follows:
```kotlin
// From https://github.com/bumptech/glide/issues/1208,
// I think I should use one instance of Glide and pass it around
glide = Glide.with(this)
```

The `RecyclerView`'s adapter is defined as:
```kotlin
class FolderAdapter(val glide: RequestManager)
```

Within the `onBindViewHolder` method, I attempt to load the image from the ZIP file:
```kotlin
CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.IO).launch {
    val zis = getZipInputStream()
    withContext(Dispatchers.Main) {
        glide.load(zis).into(holder.img)
    }
}
```

### Layout XML
Not provided.

### Stack Trace / LogCat
```
E/GlideExecutor: Request threw uncaught throwable
    com.bumptech.glide.Registry$NoModelLoaderAvailableException: Failed to find any ModelLoaders registered for model class: class java.util.zip.ZipFile$ZipFileInflaterInputStream
```

### Summary
- **Issue**: Glide does not recognize the custom `InputStream` (`ZipFileInputStream`) as a valid `InputStream`.
- **Expected Behavior**: Glide should be able to load images from the `InputStream` obtained from a ZIP file.
- **Current Behavior**: Glide throws a `Registry$NoModelLoaderAvailableException` indicating that no `ModelLoader` is available for the `ZipFile$ZipFileInflaterInputStream` class.

If you have any suggestions or need further information, please let me know.
