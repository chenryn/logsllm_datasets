User: I have an Echoprint local webserver (uses tokyotyrant, python, solr) set up on a Linux virtual machine.
I can access it through the browser or curl in the virtual machine using http//localhost:8080 and in the non-virtual machine (couldn't find out how to say it better) I use the IP on the virtual machine also with the 8080 port.
However, when I try to access it through my android on the same wifi I get a connection refused error.
Assistant: In case someone has the same problem, I solved it. 
The connection has to be by cable and on the VMware Player settings the network connection has to be bridged, also you must click "Configure adapters" and uncheck the "VirtualBox Host-Only Ethernet Adapter".
