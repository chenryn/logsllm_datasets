There's a race condition I encountered and fixed when adding the integration
spec, but I need to add a unit test around this behavior. See: #1991 (comment)
In this condition, "activate" is called multiple times with the same
`Instruction` instance, which ended up bypassing the `reuse` check. I might
need to refactor to generalize the added behavior.
