User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Logging when limit Exceeds Is there a log file that logs information when the values set in /etc/security/limits.conf are exceeded? 

If the values are too tight in the above file the clients using the website hosted on the server sees errors such as [FATAL] failed to allocate memory . But I wont be intimidated about it. So is there a log? 

If not is there a way to make it log when the values are exceeded?

Assistant: limits.conf is a too blunt an instrument for what you are trying to do.

cgroups will set limits and provide accounting for you, but the documentation is a little obtuse! https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroups/memory.txt
