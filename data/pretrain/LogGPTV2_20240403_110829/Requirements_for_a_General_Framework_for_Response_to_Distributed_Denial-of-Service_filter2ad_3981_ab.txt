### The Fundamental Lack of Trust in Human-Involved Transactions

The Internet was not designed to meet the current demands it faces, leading to a fundamental lack of trust in human-involved transactions. Research communities have proposed essential changes to the Internet or its protocols to enhance technical trust and discourage untrustworthy behavior by network entities. 

### Strategic Responses from the Research Community

The research community's strategic response contrasts with the current commercial approach, which involves introducing security measures like firewalls and cryptography to increase the technological cost of attacks. This is because there is no central authority or responsibility for the Internet's operation beyond cost considerations. As a result, attackers can often develop new attack methods faster than defenses can be implemented.

### Evolution of Attack Technology

Attack technology has evolved, with denial-of-service (DoS) attacks initially used to facilitate intrusions by bringing down systems and spoofing addresses. Now, DoS attacks are a threat in their own right, and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) toolkits require system penetration and Trojan horse programs. This returns to the trust issue: if an attacker can penetrate just one system, the need for address spoofing diminishes. The question then arises: can every user be trusted to have a high level of security awareness?

### Preventing Denial of Service in a Distributed Environment

To prevent DoS in a distributed environment, a network must fairly guarantee the delivery of services and requests from a purely technical perspective. However, this also requires fair human-computer interactions, where administrators ensure that computer systems behave equitably. For the system to operate effectively, all parties must act fairly in every transaction. Any misbehavior can lead to the exploitation of the distributed system, causing service denial to other parties. Thus, while a purely technical solution may not fully resolve the DoS problem, researchers aim to make such attacks undesirable and difficult.

### Classification of Denial-of-Service Attacks

Denial-of-service attacks are not difficult to detect. Gilgor’s work [12] highlighted that using a maximum waiting time, it is straightforward to identify when a service or request has not been delivered within the specified time. This approach identifies two key points: the acceptable time is predetermined as an operational policy requirement, and without an alternative route to request resources, only detection of the DoS is possible.

Denial-of-service attacks can be classified into two distinct problems: Consumer and Producer attacks.

#### Consumer Attacks
A Consumer attack occurs when a party C seeks to consume another party A’s request for a resource from a third party B, or consume the actual resource that B has allocated to A. For example, if Server A requests a resource from Server B via Server C, and Server C refuses to pass the request or consumes the resource, Server A may exhaust its internal resources and cease to function, violating its operating policy.

#### Producer Attacks
Producer attacks involve parties C1-Cn causing a resource to be made available to another party A, which violates A’s operating policy. For instance, if Server A is connected to multiple servers C1-n and receives resources that it cannot manage, it may face a violation of its operating policy. The victim must identify any policy constraint violations when accepting a resource, which can be resource-intensive.

### Policy Constraints

The following policy constraints have been identified:
1. **Timely Arrival**: The resource must arrive within a specified time.
2. **Correct Information**: The resource must contain accurate information.
3. **Acknowledgment**: The resource must be acknowledged if required.
4. **Actual Arrival**: The resource must actually arrive.
5. **Well-Formed Data**: The resource must not be corrupted.
6. **Correct Format**: The resource must be in the correct format.

### Requirements for Responding to Network Denial of Service

There are two primary research directions for managing network DoS incidents: prevention and response. While specific solutions exist for certain types of attacks, a general framework for responding to DDoS incidents should include:

#### a) Generality
The framework should be applicable across various platforms, providing insights into combating DoS on different systems.

#### b) Non-Exploitable
The framework must be secure and not exploitable, ensuring fault tolerance and confidentiality.

#### c) Policy
The framework should integrate integrity, availability, and acceptability, as defined by operational policies. Key aspects include:
- **Timeliness**: The framework must consider the speed of operation and the cost-benefit evaluation of time and detection.
- **Survivability/Adaptability**: The system must provide core functions even when compromised, emphasizing policy-directed adaptability.

By addressing these requirements, a more robust and effective framework for responding to DDoS incidents can be developed.
