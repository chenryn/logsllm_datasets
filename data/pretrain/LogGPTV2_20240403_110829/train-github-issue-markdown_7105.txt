I am updating state in setState() and the page is rendered correctly, but
"React Developer Tools" is showing previous state.  
Objects and Arrays are updating in realtime but not "boolean / string / number
values".  
But when I close the dev tools window ( not switching tabs ) and reopen it,
then only it shows the updated state.  
I don't remember if this was the issue from prev version, but please add
realtime state update functionality to it.
