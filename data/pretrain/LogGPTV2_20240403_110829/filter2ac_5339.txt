### Title: Don't Eat Spaghetti with a Spoon - An Analysis of the Practical Value of Threat Intelligence

**Abstract:**

Threat Intelligence is a valuable component of a mature security operation. However, like many good concepts in the cybersecurity industry, its commercialization has led to commoditization and, in some cases, potentially dangerous over-simplification. The core idea of intelligence is to provide non-obvious, actionable, and value-added information that is derived through processing and interpretation. Unfortunately, most commercial products are based on the premise that if an entity has been observed acting maliciously in one location, it will likely act maliciously in other locations as well.

This talk presents an in-depth analysis of the effectiveness of Threat Intelligence in predicting malicious activity on the Internet. Our study involves the examination of over one million threat indicators over a six-month period. We utilized a diverse set of sensors deployed on real-world networks to track a range of malicious activities, including port scans, web application scans, DoS & DDoS attacks, and exploits.

We focused on tracking the behavior of malicious IP addresses over time, examining both 'horizontal' and 'vertical' correlations. Horizontal correlations refer to the ability of one sensor to predict activity on another sensor or one target to predict activity on another target. Vertical correlations, on the other hand, refer to the ability of a sensor to predict the persistence or re-appearance of an IP indicator.

By analyzing these two sets of correlations, we aim to provide insights into the practical value of basic Threat Intelligence offerings. This analysis will help us better understand the role and significance of Threat Intelligence in our security systems and processes.

**Key Points:**
- **Commoditization and Over-Simplification:** The commercialization of Threat Intelligence has led to oversimplification, potentially reducing its effectiveness.
- **Data Collection:** Our study involved over one million threat indicators over six months, using a variety of real-world network sensors.
- **Correlation Analysis:**
  - **Horizontal Correlations:** Examining the predictive power of one sensor or target for another.
  - **Vertical Correlations:** Analyzing the persistence and re-appearance of malicious IP addresses.
- **Practical Insights:** Understanding the true value of Threat Intelligence in predicting and mitigating cyber threats.

Through this comprehensive analysis, we hope to provide a clearer picture of the practical value of Threat Intelligence and its essential role in enhancing cybersecurity operations.
