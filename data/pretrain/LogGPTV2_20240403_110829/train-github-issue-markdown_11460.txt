**Migrated issue, originally created by Anonymous**
A user has run the unit tests and is confused that many of them fail when
running with the default SQLite database. in theory it would be nice for every
single unit test to check against the current database engine and to not run
if it is known that the engine does not support a given operation.
(omitting unit test output, descriptions follow)
