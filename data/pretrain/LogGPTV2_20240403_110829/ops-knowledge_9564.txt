User: How can i install python correctly?
When i install it manually it is in the 
    /usr/local/bin 
directory but that causes many problems, for example i am not able to install modules.
I want to install it into 
    /usr/bin
Assistant: It depends on your distro.  Most of distros have it in its repository and for installing you just need to use your package manager.  for example on ubuntu it's: sudo apt-get install python or on fedora it's: su -c 'dnf install python'
