fraud, trafﬁc spam and the malware distribution discov-
ered during our analysis of the labeled dataset. Note that
we did not measure trafﬁc stealing, as this activity could
only be observed on the monetization chains whose start
and end nodes were under our control.
Trafﬁc spam. Using the trafﬁc stamps, we discovered
119K (56.3%) trafﬁc monetization chains. To identify
the presence of trafﬁc spam on each of those chains, we
compared the keywords associated with its start node do-
main with those of its end node (assuming that end nodes
purchased keywords related to the contents of their do-
mains). This works as follows:
• Keyword generation. To generate keywords for both
the start and end nodes, we used a keyword suggestion
tool by BingAds [1], a tool widely used by advertisers
to select keywords for ad targeting. This tool automati-
cally created a list of keywords (including typos) for each
domain (start and end nodes).
• Keyword ﬁltering. At this step, we cleaned the list
of keywords, discarding common ones (“www”, “com”,
etc.). Speciﬁcally, we calculated the normalized entropy
of each word as the prior work did [31] and then removed
the 50 words with the lowest entropy (i.e. highly pop-
ular). Also dropped from the keyword list were deter-
miners, pronouns, interjection and “wh”-words (“what”,
“where”, etc.), which are unlikely to be related to speciﬁc

domain content. For this purpose, we ﬁltered out the key-
words using Stanford CoreNLP [35], a natural language
processing tool for part-of-speech tagging and stemming.
• Keyword matching. Comparing the keywords of the
start node (i.e., parked domain) with those of the end
node (trafﬁc purchase website) on a monetization chain,
we considered the chain to be trafﬁc spam if individual
keywords of its parked domain did not match any words
associated with its end node. In the case that one of these
two domains do not have any keywords, we attempted to
match the other domain’s keywords to its domain name.
If this attempt succeeds, the chain would not be consid-
ered as spam, otherwise; it would.
As a result, we found that 70.7% of all PPR monetiza-
tion chains are trafﬁc spam as illustrated in Table 8 and
attributed to each parking service and trafﬁc system. Ta-
ble 9 provides some trafﬁc spam examples received by
popular brand names.

Click fraud. All labeled 97K (45.7%) PPC monetiza-
tion chains are clearly fraudulent clicks, as our crawlers
never clicked on any ads. Table 8 provides a break-
down of fraudulent clicks observed from each parking
service through ad-nets for which we have a click stamp.
By taking a close look at the ad-nets involved, we found
that none of the fraudulent clicks on the top-tier networks
(Google AdWords & BingAds) could be attributed
to a parking service, due to ad-net syndications. Park-
ing services avoid clicking on top-tier ad-nets’ ads be-
cause they have a better click fraud detection system than
2nd-tier networks and as such they only happen through
ad-net syndication. Additionally, 2% of the fraudulent
clicks could not be attributed to a parking service due
to the presence of a trafﬁc stamp between the start node
(i.e parked domain) and the click stamp. For example,
domains parked with PS6 resulted in fraudulent clicks
through a trafﬁc system (DNTX) which is owned by the
same parent company of PS6, namely TeamInternet
AG.
Also interesting is the observation that not only were
the clicks delivered through those chains completely
fraudulent but they often came from parked domains
that had nothing to do with the ad campaigns at the end
nodes. Speciﬁcally, we applied the keyword generation
and matching approach described above to analyze the
relations between the parked domains on those chains
and their corresponding end nodes. This study reveals
that 61.3% of the fraudulent clicks were from parked
domains completely unrelated to the end nodes on their

chains. Also given the fact that the average cost-per-click
(CPC), which is $0.28, is twice as much as the average
cost-per-redirect (CPR) that we paid, there is no legiti-
macy whatsoever in such click-faking activities.
Malware distribution. Also discovered in our research
is parking services’ involvement (probably unwittingly)
in malware distribution. We found that many PPR mone-
tization chains were leading to malicious content, either
through drive-by downloads or through social engineer-
ing scams such as FakeAV or ﬂash player updates (see
Figure 8 in Appendix). This occurred because the trafﬁc
systems involved did not do their due diligence in de-
tecting the trafﬁc buyers who actually disseminate mal-
ware. Using content structure clustering, a technique ap-
plied by prior research [13], we concluded that at least
3.7% of the PPR trafﬁc buyers spread malware. This il-
licit activity not only hurts the victims visiting a parked
domain but also affects the parked domain when it gets
blacklisted by URL scanners such as SafeBrowsing [12],
which reduces the monetary value of the parked domain
when its owner decides to sell it.
5.4 Revenue Analysis
Model. As discussed before, parking services are unique
in that their monetization operations involve both legiti-
mate and illegitimate activities. To understand the eco-
nomic motives behind this monetization strategy, we ana-
lyzed their revenues with a model derived from that used
in prior research [23]:
Rev = Visits· (RevFraud + RevLegit )
where the total revenue Rev is calculated from the total
number of visits and the average revenue for each visit.
This average revenue is further broken down into two
components, the part from illicit monetization (RevFraud)
and that from legitimate monetization (RevLegit). These
components were further estimated as follows:
218  23rd USENIX Security Symposium 
USENIX Association
Intuitively, the above two equations describe ﬁve pos-
sible situations when a visit to a parked domain is mon-
etized: illicit activities (click fraud or trafﬁc spam) or le-
gitimate ones (legitimate click, direct trafﬁc or afﬁliate
marking monetization). The revenue component from
the illicit activities is estimated using the probability of
click fraud PFPPC and that of trafﬁc spam PPPR · PT S,
where PPPR is the probability of direct trafﬁc monetiza-
tion (PPR) and PT S is the chance of trafﬁc spam when
PPR is chosen, together with the revenues for a click
CPC and a redirect CPR. Similarly, the legitimate rev-
enue component comes from a PPC display (with a prob-
ability PPPC) given that a user clicks on one of the ads
(with a click-through rate ppclk), type-in trafﬁc (PPPR)
when it is not subject to trafﬁc spam (with a probabil-
ity P(cid:31)T S), or afﬁliate marketing (PPPA) when the user per-
forms the operation expected (with a probability ppact).
The revenues for those legitimate activities are CPC,
CPR and CPA respectively.
Results. In our analysis, we estimated all the probabili-
ties above (PFPPC, PPPR, PT S, PPPC and PPPA) using the
larger set of all 24M visits to 100K parked domains in
a 5.5-month span (Section 2.3). Also, the click-through
rate ppclk and a user’s probability of taking an action un-
der PPA were both set to 0.02, and CPA to $0.265, all
according to the prior work [23], while CPC and CPR
were determined as $0.28 and $0.14 respectively, based
on the average cost for our ad/trafﬁc campaigns.

RevLegit = PPPC · ppclk ·CPC + PPPR ·CPR· P(cid:31)T S

In the absence of data about the total number of vis-
its per parking service, all we could do is estimate the
portion of its income from the illicit activities to its total
revenue, based upon our data. The results are shown in
Table 10.
Discussion. From the table, we can see that even rep-
utable parking services like PS2 have at least 0.8% of its
revenue come from illicit monetizations. For others, this
revenue source is even more signiﬁcant (e.g., 40.3% for
PS5 whom we found to be aggressive in its illicit mon-
etizations). Revenue from fraudulent clicks is found to
be zero for PS6 and PS4 because, as described earlier
in Section 5.3, they are bouncing their trafﬁc through
their own trafﬁc systems and as such we can not attribute
fraudulent clicks to them. Note that our estimates here
are very conservative, due to the cloaking those services
played to our crawlers (which used a small set of IP ad-
dresses) and the limited scope of our study (which only
covered 11 ad-nets and trafﬁc systems). We expect that
the ratios of illicit revenues are much higher in practice.
6 Discussion
Domain Parking Regulation. Our study uncovers the
illicit monetizations by parking services but the underly-
ing problem is even graver. Currently, there is no regula-
tion on the behaviors of parking services, which allows
them to set up arbitrary terms of services accommodat-
ing their own beneﬁts. It is worth noting that parking ser-
vices may have started to exhibit illicit monetization ac-
tivities due to the decline in their revenues [3, 29]. Also,
our research shows they have a tendency to proﬁt from
secondary domains illicitly (Figure 4), due to the difﬁ-
culty in monetizing those domains through a legitimate
channel. Protecting the advertisers’ and trafﬁc buyers’
beneﬁts in the existence of dishonest parking services
is challenging because incoming trafﬁc can be manipu-
lated. What complicates the situation more is that ad-nets
could be owned by the company who also runs parking
services and the advertisers have no fair party to talk to.
Further, direct navigation trafﬁc (i.e. zeroclick) is being
advocated by parking services and there is no guaran-
tee on the quality of the incoming trafﬁc. Our research
discloses the dark side of parked domain monetization
which calls for serious policy efforts to regulate parking
services.
Here, we suggest several practices that could mitigate
many types of illicit monetization activities when en-
forced. First, the advertisers should be provided with
a clearer picture of the monetization activities. For ex-
ample, the types of publishers should be marked out as
well to advertisers besides their publishers’ IDs, which
helps advertisers in auditing and monitoring trafﬁc com-
ing from parking services. In fact, some ad-nets are al-
ready moving to such direction: for example, Afﬁnity,
a popular ad-net, distinguishes publishers by assigning
them types such as “in-text” and “domain zero click”.
We also suggest providing trafﬁc buyers with a way to
check the integrity of incoming trafﬁc such as passing
the domain name of each start node in the referral. En-
forcement and compliance of such mechanisms requires
the presence of a 3rd party service (i.e. policy enforcer)
in the ecosystem.
Legal and ethical concerns. There are several ethi-
cal concerns raised during our study, and we carefully
designed our experiments to address them. First, we
crawled our own parked domains which is problematic
if we earn proﬁt from it. To address this issue, we avoid
cashing in the revenues we earned from the 7 parking
services hosting our parked domains ($81.06 in total).
Second, we ignore robots.txt served by parking services
when crawling since we focused on their illicit behav-
iors. Other studies on malicious activities also ignore
the robots.txt ﬁle [17, 33, 19, 7]. Third, one may ques-
tion that the artiﬁcial trafﬁc generated by our crawler
USENIX Association  
23rd USENIX Security Symposium  219
could affect the advertisers or trafﬁc buyers. In fact, we
crawled parked domains in a moderate speed and park-
ing services have deployed mechanisms to discern artiﬁ-
cial trafﬁc and stop charging the advertisers when iden-
tiﬁed [28]. Lastly, we ran campaigns with ad-nets and
trafﬁc systems but there was no actual business running.
