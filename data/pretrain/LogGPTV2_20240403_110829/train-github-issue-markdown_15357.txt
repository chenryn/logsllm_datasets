I came across the following situation that had some really unexpected
behavior:
    let [left, top] = (function that returns [number, number]);
    var reactComponent = (
    );
inside reactComponent, this.props.top was undefined...
I checked out the generated code, and it looks like babel was rewriting the
variable `top` to `_top`, but it was also rewriting the prop to `_top`, so I
was left with `<Component left={left} _top={_top}`, and was losing my prop.
(Rhyming totally unintentional...)
