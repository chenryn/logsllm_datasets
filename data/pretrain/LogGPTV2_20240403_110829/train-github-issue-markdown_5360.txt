    Before filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since the
    latest release. Search the issue tracker and check that you're running the
    latest version of Go:
    Run "go version" and compare against
    http://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html  If a newer version of Go exists,
    install it and retry what you did to reproduce the problem.
    Thanks.

    go version go1.3 linux/amd64

    What happened?
    returned error is nil when dial a non-exists address.
    What should have happened instead?
    the error should not be nil.
    Please provide any additional information below.
    It happens only on Go 1.3, Go 1.2 doesn't have this issue, so I compared the source
    code, and found out that this was caused by a change to "connect" method in
    "net/fd_unix.go" file. So I edited this method with the old version, then
    recompiled Go 1.3, the issue disappeared.
