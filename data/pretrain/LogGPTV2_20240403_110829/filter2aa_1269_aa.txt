ABSTRACT
To improve road safety and driving experiences, autonomous
vehicles have emerged recently, and they can sense their sur-
roundings and navigate without human intervention.
Al-
though promising and proving safety features, the trustwor-
thiness of these cars has to be examined before they can
be widely adopted on the road. Unlike traditional network
security, autonomous vehicles rely heavily on their sensory
ability of their surroundings to make driving decision, which
incurs a security risk from sensors. Thus, in this paper we
examine the security of the sensors of autonomous vehicles,
and investigate the trustworthiness of the ‘eyes’ of the cars.
Our work investigates sensors whose measurements are
used to guide driving, i.e., millimeter-wave radars, ultra-
sonic sensors, forward-looking cameras.
In particular, we
present contactless attacks on these sensors and show our
results collected both in the lab and outdoors on a Tesla
Model S automobile. We show that using o↵-the-shelf hard-
ware, we are able to perform jamming and spooﬁng attacks,
which caused the Tesla’s blindness and malfunction, all of
which could potentially lead to crashes and impair the safety
of self-driving cars. To alleviate the issues, we propose soft-
ware and hardware countermeasures that will improve sen-
sor resilience against these attacks.

INTRODUCTION
Improving road safety, driving experiences, and driving
eﬃciency has long been a focus of the automotive indus-
try, and already we have witnessed the rapid development
of ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems), which can
sense its driving environment and warn drivers of immediate
dangers. With the advances in sensing technology and infor-
mation fusion, vehicles are going forward into a new era —
fully autonomous vehicles. Numerous major companies and

research organizations have developed their prototype au-
tonomous cars. For instance, Tesla Motors has popularized
driverless technology with its Autopilot system.
The safety of autonomous cars has been a focus of the
prolonged debate over this technology. Comparing to tradi-
tional ones, autonomous vehicles requires almost no human
inputs for driving control, therefore safety relies purely on
the on-board computing systems, which in turn depend on
sensors and their measurements of the surroundings to make
driving decisions. Being the ‘eyes’ of on-board computing
systems, sensors play an important role in autonomous ve-
hicle safety, and their accuracy and immediacy have to be
guaranteed to achieve safe autonomous driving.
The industry has been working on improving the accuracy
and robustness of sensors. Yet the recent accident of a Tesla
Model S car crashing into a white truck and causing one
death using its on-board Autopilot system [26] shows that
existing sensors cannot reliably detect neighboring cars even
in normal yet special road conditions, not to mention inten-
tional attacks against these sensors. In light of the fact that
the security issues of sensors have not earned their due at-
tention, we investigate attacks that utilizing the underlying
principles of sensors to blind or deceive them, e.g. utilizing
how to detect barriers leveraging lights, sounds, and radio
waves. This type of attacks against sensors can lead to mal-
functions, falsiﬁed readings, or even physical damage, and
the consequences could be fatal both to one car and to a
collection of cars nearby, i.e., in a Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V)
network.
Understanding the attack methods, its feasibility, its in-
ﬂuences on sensor readings, on-board computer systems and
autonomous car behaviors will provide insights for improv-
ing the safety of self-driving automobiles. In this work, we
performed an empirical security study on the sensors of au-
tonomous cars. Speciﬁcally, we studied and examined three
types of essential automotive sensors that are widely used
for autonomous driving, i.e., ultrasonic sensors, Millimeter
Wave Radars, and cameras.
We have carried out several
attacks against them, and proved the destructive impact of
attacks on the sensor data, as well as on the automated
driving systems by experiments on a Tesla Model S sedan.
Contributions. We summarize our contributions as fol-
lows:
• We raise the security risks and concerns of sensors used
for Automated Driving and Advanced Driver Assis-
tance Systems.
• To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to ex-
perimentally examine the feasibility of launching con-
tactless attacks on automotive ultrasonic sensors and
MMW Radars.
Our experiments in the laboratory
and outdoors on vehicles have demonstrated the conse-
quences of jamming and spooﬁng attacks by exploiting
the underlying sensing principles.
• We have veriﬁed the attacks on a Tesla Model S with
Autopilot systems, and demonstrated the impact of
these attacks on automated driving system.
Roadmap. The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

vant sensors in Section 3, and list the threat model and steps
of study in Section 4. The details of attacks on ultrasonic
sensors, MMW Radars, and cameras are given respectively
in Section 5, 6, and 7, respectively.
In Section 8 we dis-
cuss the attack feasibility and countermeasures, as well as
limitations and future work. Section 9 concludes the paper.

BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
The security of automotive systems has been studied for
more than a decade. The security risk stems from the struc-
ture of automotive system, i.e., the interconnection of com-
munication buses and Electronic Control Units (ECUs). To-
day, the infrastructure of modern vehicles is designed in such
a way that all components are networked with each other by
the CAN-bus, and they can exchange data as well as con-
trol commands via the bus. This structure guarantees the
functionality and eﬃciency of modern vehicles, but poses
a serious threat in addition to potential insecure compo-
nents [32][33].
For example, security breach on one ECU
(especially those with external connections, e.g., telematics)
could possibly lead to the exploitation of other safety-critical
ECUs through the unprotected bus network (e.g., CAN bus)
and endangers the whole vehicle.
Several studies [12][28] have shown the feasibility of launch-
ing CAN bus attacks (mainly through OBD-II port) which
can cause malfunction and even take control of the car. It
has been demonstrated that an attacker who is able to in-
ﬁltrate virtually any ECUs can leverage this ability to com-
pletely circumvent a broad array of safety-critical systems,
such as falsifying the control panel displays, disabling the
brakes, killing the engine, and rolling the steering wheel.
In addition, it has been shown that the attacks can be
launched without any physical access to the car. Checkoway
et al. [3] analyzed the external attack surfaces of a modern
automobile, and discovered that remote exploitation is feasi-
ble via a broad range of attack vectors (including mechanics
tools, CD players, Bluetooth and cellular radio), and further,
that wireless communications channels allow long distance
vehicle control, location tracking, in-cabin audio exﬁltration
and theft. Miller and Valasek, after their survey [15] of 21
popular car models, performed a remote attack against un
unaltered Jeep Cherokee that resulted in physical control of
part of the vehicle [16].
Previous researches on vehicle security mostly focused on
the internal network and Electronic Control Units (e.g., telem-
atics and immobilizer).
However, few attention has been
paid to sensors.
Existing attacks depend mainly on vul-
nerable information interfaces, while the sensory (physical)
channels have not attracted their due attention and shall be
exploited thoroughly.
Petit et al. has recently raised people’s attention to sen-
sors by his study on LiDAR and cameras [19]. Their work
focused on remote attacks on camera-based system and Li-
DAR using commodity hardware, which achieved e↵ective
blinding, jamming, replay, relay, and spooﬁng attacks.
In our research, we focus on the security of popular vehic-
ular sensors that have already been widely used in Advanced
Driver Assistance System (ADAS) and self-driving cars. We
will show experiment results that were conducted both in
laboratories and on popular cars, including models of Tesla,
Audi, Volkswagen, and Ford.

SYSTEM OVERVIEW
In this section we give a brief introduction to the Au-
tomated Driving System and Advanced Driver Assistance
System, as well as the sensor technologies, and discuss the
motivation to examine ultrasonic sensors, MMW Radars,
and cameras.

Sensor Overview
Before discussing the detailed principles underlying these
sensors, we overview their features and compare their di↵er-
ence.
Sensor categories.
Ultrasonic sensors, MMW radars,
cameras, and LiDAR are indispensable sensors on current
self-driving vehicles. Each is designed for its dedicated sens-
ing range. Nevertheless, they, in combination, can detect
obstacles in a wide range.
They can be roughly divided
into proximity, close-range, middle-range, and long-range,
as shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1: Major ADAS sensor types and typical ve-
hicle positions [24].
1. Proximity ( 5m). Ultrasonic sensors are proximity sen-
sors that aim at detecting barriers within several me-
ters from the car body. They are mainly designed for
low speed scenarios, e.g., parking assistance.
2. Short Range ( 30m).
Forward-looking cameras are
used for lane departure warning, Traﬃc sign recogni-
tion, and backward cameras are for parking assistance.
Short-range radars (SRR) serve for blind spot detec-
tion and cross traﬃc alert.
3. Medium Range (80 − 160m).
LiDAR and Medium-
range radars (MRR) assists collision avoidance and
pedestrian detection.
4. Long Range (250m).
Long-range radars (LRR) are
designed for Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) at high
speeds.
Because the physical principles underlying these technolo-
gies varies, their operation ranges are di↵erent as well. We
emphasize the major di↵erences of these technologies below.
Physical principle. On-board vehicle sensors for detect-
ing barriers and road condition utilize three types of waves.
Both LiDAR and cameras rely on lights (i.e., infrared and
visible light) to recognize objects. In comparison, ultrasonic
sensors detect obstacles by transmitting and receiving ul-
trasound, which is one type of mechanical waves with their
frequency beyond human hearing ranges. MMW radars rely
on millimeter waves, a band of electromagnetic wave whose
frequency is much lower than light yet much higher than
well-known radio frequency range (e.g., 2.4 GHz). Because
each type of sensors rely on a distinct underlying principle,
various methods and equipment have to be utilized to attack
each type of sensors.
Cost.
Costs of manufacturing sensors determine their
market shares. The costs from low to high are the ones of
ultrasonic sensors, cameras, radar, and LiDAR. Because of
the low cost, ultrasonic sensors have been widely deployed
on modern vehicles for parking assistance systems, but other
sensors are reserved for high-end features. Cost-performance
trade-o↵ is perhaps the reason that car manufacturers (e.g.,
Tesla) abandon LiDAR [8], but self-driving prototype de-
velopers (e.g., Google [7] and Stanford [25]) tend to utilize
every possible sensor.
Since not all manufacturers utilize LiDAR, we examine
the other three types of sensors that have been widely ap-
plied on existing vehicles for driver assistance system, with
a focus on ultrasonic sensors and MMW radars in this work.
The security vulnerabilities of automotive ultrasonic sensors
and MMW radars have never been discussed before. We be-
lieve that our work is complementary to Petit’s work, and
together we provide a better picture of the sensor issues in
self-driving vehicles.
Apart from in-lab studies on stand-
alone sensors, we carries out outdoor experiments on vehi-
cles in this work. Note that Tesla model S cars employ all
three sensors in the ‘Autopilot’ systems and thus most of
our work involves testing on a Tesla model S vehicle.

ATTACK OVERVIEW
This section gives an overview on our attacks.
In the
threat model we propose the assumptions and requirements
of an attacker. In the attack model we introduce our basic
ideas and research steps.
4.1
Threat Model
Knowledge Threshold. We assume that the attacker
may not have prior knowledge of the sensing mechanism, and
need to learn or consult professionals. In the extreme case
that the attacker being a sensor expert himself, he may be
well-aware of the vulnerabilities or proﬁcient with the attack
skills, but he still need to overcome the knowledge threshold
of other sensors. We further assume he is medium ﬁnanced
and qualiﬁed for independent or collaborative research.
Equipment Awareness.
We can assume that an at-
tacker has access to the targeted sensors or similar ones for
prior study, considering that sensors of the same kind but
from di↵erent vendors can exhibit distinctive patterns in the
physical channel. The attacker may be proﬁcient with hard-
ware design, or can exploit o↵-the-shelf hardware to fulﬁl his
attack purposes. We don’t think he has access to expensive
equipments or well-funded research facilities.
Attacker Position. The attacker has to be outside the
car in order for the attacks to be executed and remain stealthy.
Limitations. No physical alteration or damage is allowed
or can be made to the targeted vehicle with the purpose of
dampening the performance, i.e., the vehicle and sensors
have to remain unaltered.
Attack Outcome. With dedicated research e↵ort and
at least the above mentioned qualities, we think an attacker
can cause malfunction of low-priority close-range sensors,
and cause collisions in maneuvering. He may have a chance
in disturbing safety-critical sensors, but the attack is likely
impractical when the vehicle is fast moving.
4.2
Attack Model
Three very di↵erent kinds of sensors are under the scope
of our attacks, therefore their approaches also exhibit great
diversity.
Before presenting the speciﬁcs, there are some
common points they share that we would like to stress.
4.2.1
Sensor Attacks
The most signiﬁcant distinction between sensor attacks
and cyber attacks is the use of physical channels. Sensor
attacks utilize the same physical channels as the targeted
sensor in most cases, which can disrupt or manipulate the
sensor readings. Since sensors are categorized as the lower
layers of a control system and are normally trusted, falsiﬁed
readings could lead to unexpected consequences of a system.
A recent example would be the acoustic attack against the
gyroscopic sensors on a drone [23].
Comparing with cyber attacks, sensor attacks have the
disadvantages of close attack range, extra hardware require-
ment, long exploitation cycle, and high knowledge threshold.
Given the fact that di↵erent sensors may depend on com-
pletely di↵erent physical principles, very di↵erent methods
must be used against them, which means low transplantabil-
ity. In this work, we use ultrasound against ultrasonic sen-
sors, radio against MMW radars and laser against cameras.
Noticeably, ultrasound, radio, and laser all promise no phys-
ical contact with the targeted sensors, thus make our attacks
contactless.
4.2.2
Basic Idea
Our basic idea for examining the security of all three sen-
sors is to analyze their following abilities by injecting noise
