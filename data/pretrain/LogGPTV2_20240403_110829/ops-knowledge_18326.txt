User: I've got a Python app making 3 different api calls one after another in the same block of code. I'd like to execute these calls asynchronously, and then perform an action when they're all complete.
A couple notes:

Other answers regarding async actions point to frameworks like Twisted and Celery, but I'm building a Web2Py app for the GAE, so those daemon-based frameworks aren't an option AFAIK.
I'm using api wrapper libraries for the various apis, so I'm wondering if there's an async solution that can be implemented at the thread level, rather than the http request level?
Assistant: If you're brave, you might try the Experimental new DB api, NDB. It has async APIs for working with the datastore + URL fetch. If those are the things you hoped to do async-ly, then you're in luck.
