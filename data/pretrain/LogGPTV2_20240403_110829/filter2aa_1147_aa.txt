The Modern Internet
A Price of Convenience
“…One  can  easily  remain  free  of  even  the  most  intense  political  oppression  simply  by  placing  one’s  faith  and  trust  in  
institutions of authority.”  
– Glenn Greenwald
“When  I  am  afraid,  I  put  my  trust  in  you.”  
– Psalm 56:3

A State of Change
• The Argument
• Internet access is a basic human right
• We have the right to share our content freely
• The Modern Internet
• The right to share files online has been under assault
• Governments, corporations and others fear openness
• Losing our fundamental rights to privacy and personal beliefs
• The Goal
• Individual privacy rights and freedoms are protected
• Digital self-expression is commonplace and encouraged
3
A State of Unity and Distrust
• Corporations and 3rd Parties
• Ubiquitous and pervasive computing
• Interoperability through industry standards
• Data breaches, financial repercussions, erosion of trust, and the bottom line
• Users
• Division between an individual and his/her data
• Are we greater than the sum of our personal data?
• Who owns our information?
• Governments and Enforcers
• Data aggregation and mining
• The ease of accountability
• Unlawful transparency

A State of Recovery
• The Qualifications
• Experts in our fields
• An arsenal of tools, experiences, and technologies
• We choose not to live in a world of illegal surveillance
• The Right to Share
• Data manifesto
• A recipe for changing the world
• The path to limitless file sharing
• Secure transfer of personal information between all of your devices, from 
anywhere in the world
• Understanding our right to share is the first step

A Brief History
From FTP to µTorrent
“The  increase  of  disorder  or  entropy  is  what  distinguishes  the  past  from  the  future,  giving  a  direction  to  time.”
– Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time
“Information  is  power.    But  like  all  power,  there  are  those  who  want  to  keep  it  for  themselves.”
– Aaron Swartz

File Sharing Problems
• Insecure
• Trust a 3rd party source
• Reveal your identity via P2P
• Illegal disconnections
• Complacent
• Forcing us to seek alternate viewing methods
• File-sharing is a method by which the industry is forced to evolve
• Adapt or die
• Expensive
• The Cloud
• Dropbox, Box
• HBO Go
12
File Sharing Problems
• Inflexible
• I want my files available everywhere at all times
• I don't want to force-sync content across all devices
• Not everybody should be forced to seed
• Acquisition vs. Aggregation
• What if I'm offline?
• Inconvenient
• I  don’t  want  to  watch  ads
• I want to watch the show that I am paying for
• Hulu+ should be more like Netflix
• People will pay for content if it's convenient and reasonably priced
• Netflix, Amazon Prime, Crackle, Revision 3

A Recipe for Change
From Lemons to Fruity Juice
“I  don’t  want  to  live  in  a  world  where  there’s  no  privacy,  and  therefore  no  room  for  intellectual  exploration  and  creativity.”
– Edward Snowden
“People who think they know everything really annoy those of us who know we don't.”
– Bjarne Stroustrup

A Tricky Business
• Conflicting Interests
• Availability, performance, and ease of use
• Anonymity and security
• Market Evolution
• Inadequacy breeds innovation
• Created a niche market for such products
• VPN’s  and  proxies
• Cloud computing
• Rapidshare, Mega(upload)
• Dropbox, Box
• Plex
• The Next Generation
• Leverage our over-priced ISP connections
• File sharing can do better

Key Principles of File Sharing
• Authoritative Source
• Stateless Authentication
• Modular Security
• Standard Protocols
• Distributed Endpoints
16
Authoritative Source
• Overview
• Primary repository of trusted data
• Data is the foundation of file sharing
• First to be secured
• Last to be compromised
• Too Quick to Trust
• Models based on trust are flawed
• Where has trust historically gotten us?
• Don’t  be surprised when trust is betrayed
• Once  it’s  gone,  it’s  gone  forever
Saving Cyberspace means that we need to reclaim the Authoritative Source
17
Authoritative Source
• A Costly Convenience
• The price of the Modern Internet
• We’ve  already  given  away  so  much
• Applications fight over control of our data
• Companies abuse our sensitive data
• The bottom line seldom favors the customer
• Too Much to Lose
• The control of our sensitive data
• The  power  to  protect  what’s  ours
• The certainty that our data is protected
• The choice to respond to attacks
• The ability to remain anonymous
Saving Cyberspace means that we need to reclaim the Authoritative Source
18
Authoritative Source
• The Solution
• Take responsibility
• Reclaim the Authoritative Source
• Do what companies continue to fail at
• Anonymize our file sharing habits
• Secure our data
Saving Cyberspace means that we need to reclaim the Authoritative Source
19
Stateless Authentication
• Overview
• Form of shared secret authentication
• Leverages shared assets or other known data
• Shared secret is obvious to a very specific group
• Dynamic encryption algorithms
• State-Based Applications
• What does it mean to authenticate?
• Inadequate file sharing security models 
• Credentials are antiquated and unnecessary
• Certificates rely on trusted 3rd parties
• No registration process or data storage 
• Security only needs to be secure enough
Saving Cyberspace means that we will need to redefine authentication

Stateless Authentication
• Data Oversight
• Who’s  storing  our  information?
• How is our data being used?
• Who’s  selling  us  out  to  the  government?
• Companies are incapable of protecting our data
• The Solution
• Shared authentication creates temporary trust
• Breaches  don’t  reveal  any  personal  information
• Don’t  have  to  worry  about  identity  leakage
• If you want it done right, do it yourself
• “Doveryai,  no  proveryai”
Saving Cyberspace means that we will need to redefine authentication

Modular Security
• Overview
• Based on Layered Security
• Division of authority and separation of duties
• Total is greater than the sum of the parts
• Inability to store complete secrets
• Double-blind
• Plausible Deniability
• Always assume somebody is listening
• Multiple modules of defense resist penetration
• What  they  don’t  know  won’t  hurt  you
• They  can’t  audit  what  you  don’t  have
• Entire system must be compromised
Saving Cyberspace means that we will need to implement a modular approach to security

Modular Security
• Applications
• Poor choices in software architecture/design
• Too many single points of failure
• Reveal too much information
• The Solution
• Messages increase strength as they propagate
• Each  module  is…
• Isolated
• Autonomous
• Self-sufficient
• Resistant to attacks
Saving Cyberspace means that we will need to implement a modular approach to security
