There is a lack of warning for incorrectly parsed configurations. In this case
I set invalid values for the following configurations in elasticsearch.yml :
    # incorrect values because booleans have to be lowercase
    node.master: True
    node.data: True
    discovery.zen.ping.multicast.enabled: false
    discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: ["localhost"]
But elastic search starts and I am able to see the following cluster nodes:
    curl localhost:9200/_nodes/http?pretty=true
    {
      "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
      "nodes" : {
          ...
          "attributes" : {
            "master" : "True",
            "data" : "True"
          },
         ...
        },
The only indication when I get that there is a problem is when I try to run
other commands to access the data in the cluster. This is the error that I get
back when I try to add a mapping to my_index:
    curl -X PUT localhost:9200/my_index -d @mapping.json'
    {"error":"MasterNotDiscoveredException[waited for [30s]]","status":503}
In this case, it would be useful to fail server start if there is an incorrect
parameter or issue some sort of warning or have it logged. I ran this on
elasticsearch 1.3.4.
