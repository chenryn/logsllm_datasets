User: How to configure nginx reverse proxy and optimize its performance?
Assistant: Configure nginx reverse proxy: 1. Install nginx: Use a package manager (such as apt, yum) to install nginx according to the requirements of the operating system. 2. Configure the reverse proxy: configure the proxy server address in the nginx configuration file, for example: ``` server { listen 80; server_name example.com; location / { proxy_pass http://backend.server.com; proxy_set_header Host $ host; proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade; proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade; proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade'; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; $scheme; proxy_cache_bypass $http_pragma; proxy_cache_revalidate on ; proxy_cache_valid 200 360m; proxy_cache_valid 404 1m; proxy_cache_key "$scheme$request_method$host$request_uri"; proxy_read_timeout 600; } } ``` In this example, nginx will listen on port 80, when a request arrives, nginx will send it Forward to the server named backend.server.com. \ It is not necessary to configure load balancing, but if you want to distribute requests to multiple servers, you can choose to use nginx's load balancing module (such as IP Hash or Round Robin). Optimize nginx reverse proxy performance: 1. Determine machine resources and nginx configuration files: Make sure that nginx configuration files are optimized according to machine resources (CPU, memory, hard disk, network bandwidth, etc.). Events can also be handled asynchronously to improve performance. 2. Configure cache: Using nginx's proxy_cache module to configure cache can greatly improve performance. Presetting the disk size of the cache storage area can effectively avoid the problem of the cache being exhausted. 3. Use reverse proxy cache: Setting an appropriate cache time can cache some requests locally, reducing proxy requests. Static content has a good caching effect. If the content needs to be refreshed in time, you can use a cache key with an appropriate caching strategy (such as ETag or LastModified). 4. Tightly control the size of requests: The exact way a system can successfully handle a large number of small requests is to handle many more requests at the same time. Based on this principle, requests should be minimized and content maximized without complexity. Controlling the cache file size at around 50kb will result in a higher read speed. 5. Encrypted connections: Since HTTPS, a free communication standard developed in 2021, has become a standard security protocol, it allows you to encrypt connections for your website, protecting the privacy and security of user data while improving user trust and overall website performance. HTTPS certification can be obtained for free using free services such as Letsencrypt. 6. Adjust kernel parameters: In order to optimize the performance of Nginx, kernel parameters (such as adjusting TCP buffer and queue length) must be adjusted to improve server performance when receiving and processing requests. You can use the following commands to adjust kernel parameters: ``` #TCP Buffer Optimization $ sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_rmem='4096 87380 12582912' $ sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_wmem='4096 87380 12582912' $ sysctl -w net .core.wmem_max=12582912 $ sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=12582912 $ sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling=1 # TCP Queue Optimization $ sysctl -w net.core.somaxconn=40000 $ sysctl -w net.ipv4 .tcp_max_syn_backlog=40000 $ sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse=1 $ sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout=30 #File descriptor optimization $ ulimit -n 10000 ``` After optimizing the kernel parameters, it needs to be in the nginx configuration file Add the following configuration: ``` worker_rlimit_nofile 50000; events { worker_connections 4000; } ``` 7. Configure Gzip: Compress (gzip) the transmitted data to save bandwidth. Nginx supports gzip compression by default. You just need to adjust it as needed. The configuration is as follows: ``` gzip on; gzip_disable "msie6"; gzip_vary on; gzip_proxied any; gzip_comp_level 6; gzip_buffers 16 8k; gzip_http_version 1.1; application /xml+rss text/javascript; ``` 8. Reduce file I/O operations: Nginx file I/O is expensive, and operations such as uploading files through Put requests can lead to a large number of file I/O operations. To solve this problem, modules such as Nginx upload can be installed and configured, which will greatly improve file processing performance. Through the above methods, you can optimize and improve the performance of Nginx reverse proxy. You can measure the impact of these tuning parameters on your application by testing benchmark performance metrics.
