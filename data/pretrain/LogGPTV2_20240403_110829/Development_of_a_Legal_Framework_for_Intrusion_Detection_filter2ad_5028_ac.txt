–  do  they  forfeit  any  expectation  of  privacy  with  respect  to  those  activities?
According  to  provisions  in  the  USA  PATRIOT  Act,  a  computer  trespasser  is  “a
person  who  accesses  a  protected  computer  without  authorization  and  thus  has  no
reasonable  expectation  of  privacy  in  any  communication  transmitted  to,  through  or
from the protected computer.”23  In any event, expectations of  privacy are  probably
considerably  different  in  each  case.    Whatever  the  expectations,  IDS  are  not
sufficiently discriminating to distinguish between malicious activity (which should be
monitored and logged) and benign activity (the privacy of which should be respected).
If the above analysis is correct, then the header portions of communications over
the Internet would probably not be considered private. This distinction may prove to
be important when interpreting the legislation in particular, and in configuring IDS to
conform  to  the  law.    What  exactly  are  the  relevant  provisions  of  criminal  and  anti-
terrorism? How do organizations use IDS in a lawful manner?
5   Criminal Law
Criminal  law  generally  prohibits  the  intercept  of  private  communications.  For
example,  the  Criminal  Code  states:  “every  one  who,  by  means  of  any  electro-
magnetic,  acoustic,  mechanical  or  other  device,  willfully  intercepts  a  private
communication  is  guilty  of  an  indictable  offence”.24    Electro-magnetic,  acoustic,
mechanical or other device includes any device or apparatus that is used or is capable
of  being  used  to  intercept  a  private  communication.25    Intercept  includes  “listen  to,
record  or  acquire  a  communication  or  acquire  the  substance,  meaning  or  purport
thereof”.26
It is important to note that an IDS is a computer in its own right, with a processor,
primary and secondary storage, and input/output elements.  The input element is the
interface to the network, typically a network interface card (NIC) designed to IEEE
802.x standards.  This interface operates in promiscuous mode, and it ‘captures’ every
well-formed link-level frame – the format for the transmission of IP datagrams across
a network.  Once they have been ‘captured’ by the NIC, a copy of the frames and their
contents (i.e. the information they contain) are placed in the sensor’s primary memory
for  analysis.  Even  if  the  IP  datagrams  are  eventually  discarded  (because  they  are
deemed to be legitimate traffic), the IDS is in fact copying all of the network traffic.

US Code, Title 18, Part I, Chapter 119, Section 2510 by adding a new subsection 2510(21)
containing the definition of a computer trespasser.  None of the other legislation contains a
statement of this nature.

For the purposes of criminal law, is it essential that packet contents be intercepted,
or does it still constitute an intercept if only the packet header is captured?  Does the
intercept take place when the link-level frame is copied into memory, or does it only
take  place  when  the  packet  is  logged  because  it  has  been  deemed  to  be  malicious?
These questions will probably only be answerable in a court of law.  In the author’s
view, however, given that IDS make a copy of all network traffic, regardless of what
they actually log, the use of IDS will almost certainly be considered to fall within the
definition of device, and to be considered an intercept within the meaning of criminal
law.  
5.1   Exemptions in Criminal Law
The above analysis led to the conclusion that the use of IDS would likely, by strict
definition,  constitute  an  offence  against  relevant  provisions  in  criminal  law.    There
are,  however,  exemptions  in  the  criminal  law  that  specify  conditions  under  which
intercept would not be an offence.  In general, the exemptions are where consent to
the interception, express or implied, has  been given by  the originator  of  the  private
communication or the intended recipient; where an authorization has been obtained;
and where the interception is by a person engaged in providing a telephone, telegraph
or other communication service to the public.
Consent
Consent  provisions  imply  that  one  party  consent  to  the  interception  (i.e.  either  the
originator or the intended recipient) is sufficient to exempt the individual performing
the  interception  from  the  effects  of  criminal  law.  Obtaining  the  consent  of  the
recipient (e.g. the employee) may be straightforward  by  making  consent  part of  the
conditions  of  being  granted  a  network  account,  or  use  banners  indicating  that  the
information  system  being  used  is  subject  to  being  monitored  for  security  purposes,
and that continued use of the system constitutes consent to such monitoring.27 What
happens  if  an  individual  sends  a  communication  to  the  wrong  address?    Does  the
(unintended) recipient have a right to consent to its interception?  The answer to this
question is not at all clear.
Obtaining  the  consent  of  originators  (i.e.  persons  outside  the  organization  where
the monitoring is taking place) may be more problematic.  Two key concepts related
to consent are knowledge and choice.  Does the individual know that the intercept is
taking place?  Ensuring that the originator knows the interception is taking place may
be problematic.  Does the individual have a realistic choice – is there an alternative
communications  path  that  is  not  subject  to  monitoring  (intercept)?    In  terms  of
network  communications,  the  answer  to  the  latter  question  is  probably  no  –  most
organizations  will  try  to  ensure  that all  points  of  interconnection  to  the  Internet  are
adequately protected against intrusions (including the use of IDS).
27 However, mere employee consent to surveillance is no longer sufficient to justify unlimited
surveillance activities.  Surveillance is to be limited to that which a reasonable person would
consider appropriate.  See: Geist, M., “Shift to more workplace privacy protection”, dated 28
June 2002, Globe and Mail newspaper (online).
148         S.R. Johnston
There  is  also  the  issue  of  implied  consent.    For  an  individual  external  to  the
organization, does the continued use of the computer system really constitute consent
to monitoring for security purposes?  Does the posting of a legal or privacy policy to a
website  create  a  diminished  expectation  of  privacy?  Should  consent  to  intercept  be
implied by the simple act of sending an e-mail? In the absence of definitive proof that
the  individual  initiating  the  communication  knew  that  the  communication  would  be
subject to intercept, it is likely that the courts would tend to be conservative and deem
that the originator has a reasonable expectation that the communication would not be
intercepted.28
The Supreme Court of Canada has held that one party consent to the monitoring of
private  communications,  even  though  it  does  not  contravene  the  provisions  of  the
Criminal Code, violates the protection provided by Section 8 of the Charter, dealing
with  search  and  seizure.29    This  implies  that  organizations  could  not  rely  on  this
provision to provide adequate legal authority to conduct intrusion detection.
Authorization
In  order  for  an  authorization  for  the  interception  of  private  communications  to  be
granted  under  criminal  law,  there  must  be  reasonable  grounds  to  believe  that  an
offence against criminal law has been or will be committed; either the originator of
the private communication or the person intended by the originator to receive it has
consented  to  the  interception;  and  there  must  be  reasonable  grounds  to  believe  that
information concerning the offence will be obtained through the interception sought.
30    Authorizations  are  required  for  each  instance  of  interception,  and  requests  for
authorization must specify the particulars of the offence.  When the authorization is
granted,  it  will  specify  the  identities  of  the  persons,  if  known,  whose  private
communications are to be intercepted, and the period for  which  the  authorization  is
required.31 Most authorizations can only be granted for a maximum of 60 days before
they need to be renewed.
Criminal  law  provisions  for  interception  of  private  communications  are  not
generally  suited  to  interception  of  private  communications  for  network  protection.
Given the unpredictable nature of network intrusions, it would be difficult to provide
particulars of the offence that will be committed.  In most cases it will be impossible
to  accurately  identify  the  responsible  individuals,  and  for  intrusion  detection
purposes, the authorization would need to be permanent.
28 Rubinkam, M., “Court to Decide on Web Wiretapping”, Los Angeles Times article, dated 19
February 2002.  In this article, the author refers to a case heard by the Pennsylvania Superior
Court.  The court ruled that the accused “had consented to the recording by the very act of
sending  e-mail  and  instant  messages”.    The  court  further  stated  that  “any  reasonably
intelligent person, savvy enough to be using the Internet… would be aware that messages are
received  in  a  recorded  format,  by  their  very  nature”.    While  not  authoritative,  a  court  in
Canada may find this case informative/instructive.

Telecommunications Service Providers
Criminal law provides exemptions relating to interception of private communications
by  the  provider  of  a  telephone,  telegraph  or  other  communication  service32  to  the
public.  The terms telephone and telegraph are not explicitly defined in criminal law,
however, the definition of telecommunications is sufficiently broad that telephone and
telegraph communication services would likely cover network services.
Interception must be necessary for the provision of the service, or it must relate to
service  observing  or  random  monitoring  for  the  purposes  of  service  quality  control
checks.  Depending on the service being provided, an argument could easily be made
that  the  use  of  IDS  as  an  integral  component  of  a  layered  security  architecture  is
essential to ensure the quality of the service, especially confidentiality, integrity and
availability.    Other  methods  of  detecting  intrusions,  such  as  detailed  review  of  all
entries in device logs, are potentially more invasive than the use of IDS, which act as
a filter to reduce the volume of information examined by an analyst.
These conditions, which would seem to apply to the use of IDS, apply to a person
who is providing a telephone, telegraph or other communication service to the public.
A key reason for public and private sector organizations moving online is to be able to
improve the service they provide to the public.  However, it is not at all clear if this is
sufficient  for  them  to  be  considered  a  telecommunications  service  provider  for  the
purposes of criminal law.  This is an issue that will require further analysis.
Previous analysis led to the conclusion that the header portions of network traffic
probably  do  not  constitute  private  communications.    However,  the  use  of  IDS  for
network traffic monitoring would probably still constitute an intercept under criminal
law,  as  the  initial  copying  of  network  traffic  includes  content,  even  if  it  is  not
subsequently logged.  An examination of existing criminal law exemptions suggests
their  application  to  public  or  private  sector  organizations  would  be  problematic  at
best.    They  were  intended  for  the  intercept  of  private  communications  for  the
purposes  of  collecting  evidence  of  a  criminal  offence,  not  for  network  protection
purposes.
6   Anti-terrorism Law
Prior to September 11, the interception of private communications was governed by
criminal law as discussed above.  The general conclusion was that the use of IDS may
constitute an interception as defined in criminal law, and that the existing exemptions
did  not  adequately  address  the  interception  of  private  communications  for  network
protection purposes.    In  response  to  the  attacks  on  the  World  Trade  Center  and  the
Pentagon,  a  number  of  countries  either  initiated  or  accelerated  plans  to  introduce
32  See  e.g.:  (COE)  Convention  on  Cybercrime  (ETS  185),  Section  1A,  article  1(c),  and
Explanatory Report, article 26.  “Service provider” means  any public  or  private  entity  that
provides to users of its service the ability to communicate by means of a computer system.
The  term  "service  provider"  is  deliberately  broad,  and  may  include  a  closed  group  or  the
facilities of a provider that are open to the public, whether free of charge or for a fee. The
closed group can be, for example, the employees of a private enterprise to whom the service
is offered by a corporate network.
