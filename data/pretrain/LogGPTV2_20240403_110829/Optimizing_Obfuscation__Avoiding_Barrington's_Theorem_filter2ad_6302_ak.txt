Proof. Consider an element s ∈ D(e). As before denote the circuit representing s by α(s).
Alternately, we view α(s) as a polynomial with the kth monomial being represented by sk.
Moreover, the value sk satisﬁes the following three properties.

• For every sk we have that S(sk) = S(s) and therefore Uj ⊆ S(sk) for every j ∈ [l].
• The circuit α(sk) contains only multiplication gates.
• The basic sub-elements of each sk are a subset of the basic sub-elements of some s

2) for bi
1 = Prof(sk)inp1(i) and bi
From the ﬁrst property and Claim 16, we have that Prof(sk) is complete. Since every basic sub-
element of sk is a also a sub-element of s and also because s is a sinlge-input element we have
that Prof(sk) = Prof(s). Further for every i ∈ [l], there exists a basic sub-element e(cid:48) of sk such
that S(e(cid:48)) = S(i, bi
2 = Prof(sk)inp2(i). There can be many such
basic sub-elements but the second property ensures that there is a unique such element. The

Before we describe the next claim we will introduce some notation. Consider a random variable
X. Let g be a polynomial. We say that g(X) ≡ 0 if g is 0 on all the support of X. We deﬁne
V real
C to be the distribution of the assignment of the values to pe.
Claim 18. Consider an element e. Let pe be a polynomial of degree poly(n) represented by
α(C). If pe (cid:54)≡ 0 then the following holds.

Proof. The claim would directly follow from Schwartz-Zippel lemma if the distribution
corresponding to the random variable V real
C is a uniform distribution or even if the distribution
could be computed by a low degree polynomial over values uniformly distributed over Zp. But
this is not true since the entries in R−1 cannot be expressed as a polynomial in the entries of
R. To this end, we do the following. We transform pe into another polynomial p(cid:48)
e and further
transform V real
[pe(V real
C into another distribution ˜V real

C can be computed by a polynomial over values that
In order to obtain p(cid:48)
e from pe we essentially replace the matrices R−1

· det(Ri). In a similar way we obtain ˜V real
in pe with adjugate matrices
C by

replacing all the assignment values corresponding to R−1
by assignment values corresponding

We now argue p(cid:48)
j(cid:54)=i
e satisﬁes all the three properties stated above. The following shows that
the ﬁrst property is satisﬁed.

We now show that the second property is satisﬁed. The degree of(cid:81)
i∈[n] det(Ri) is at most n· w
e is at most n · w times the degree of pe, which is still a polynomial in
and hence the degree of p(cid:48)
n. Finally, we show that that the third property is satisﬁed. To see this note that adj(Ri) can
be expressed as polynomial with degree at most w in the entries of Ri. Using this, we have that
the distribution corresponding to ˜V real
C can be computed by a polynomial (of degree at most w)
over values that are uniform over Zp.

Now that we have constructed the polynomial p(cid:48)

We now show that in order to zero-test an element it suﬃces to individually zero-test all the
elements in its decomposition. This will complete the proof that our simulator satisﬁes the
correctness property.
Theorem 9. Consider an element e such that U ⊆ S(e) and let pe be the polynomial computed
by the circuit α(e). We have the following:

Further We now move to the case when pe is a zero polynomial. We claim that ps is a zero
polynomial for every s ∈ D(e). From Claim 18 we know that ps can be expressed as qProf(s) ·
2) = (Prof(s)inp1(i), Prof(s)inp2(i)). Observe that the marginal distribution of
˜αi,bi
˜αProf(s) is uniform for every s ∈ D(e). Hence, qProf(s) should be zero on all points of its support.
In other words, qProf(s) ≡ 0 and hence, ps ≡ 0 thus proving the theorem
As a consequence of the above theorem, we prove the following corollary.
Corollary 3. Consider an element e such that U ⊆ S(e) and let pe be the polynomial computed
by the circuit α(e). We have the following.

The proof of the above corollary follows from the above theorem and the following claim. This
completes the proof of correctness of the simulation of zero-testing.
