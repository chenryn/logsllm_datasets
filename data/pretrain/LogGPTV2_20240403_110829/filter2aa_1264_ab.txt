### Internet Domain and SMTP Service

Your Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) service is responsible for delivering outgoing messages to the mail service of the recipient's domain.

#### Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)

SMTP is a protocol used for sending and transferring email. It queues outgoing mail messages from the user, which are then transferred across the Internet to their destinations, where they are picked up by the incoming mail protocols.

Mac OS X Server uses Postfix (www.postfix.org) as its mail transfer agent (MTA). Postfix fully supports the standard SMTP protocol. Your email users should configure their email applications to use your Mac OS X Server running Postfix as the outgoing mail server and access their incoming mail from a Mac OS X Server running the incoming mail service.

If you choose to use another MTA, such as Sendmail, you will not be able to configure your mail service using the Mac OS X Server administration tools. To use Sendmail instead of Postfix, you must disable the current SMTP service through Postfix and then install and configure Sendmail. For more information about Sendmail, visit www.sendmail.org.

### Incoming Mail

Mail is transferred from the incoming mail storage to the recipient's inbox by a local delivery agent (LDA). The LDA handles local delivery, making mail accessible to the user’s email application. Mac OS X Server supports two protocols for mail access: POP and IMAP.

#### Cyrus for POP and IMAP

Mac OS X Server uses Cyrus (asg.web.cmu.edu/cyrus) to provide POP and IMAP services.

##### Post Office Protocol (POP)

POP is used only for receiving mail, not for sending it. The mail service of Mac OS X Server stores incoming POP mail until users connect to the mail service and download their waiting mail. Once downloaded, the mail is stored only on the user’s computer, and the connection is dropped. This reduces the load on both the network and the mail server.

**Advantages of POP:**
- Reduced server storage requirements.
- Transitory connections that minimize network and server load.

**Disadvantages of POP:**
- If a client computer sustains hard disk damage, previously downloaded mail cannot be recovered without backups.
- Not suitable for users who access mail from multiple computers, as mail is typically removed from the server after download.

##### Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)

IMAP is ideal for users who need to access mail from multiple computers. It is a client-server protocol that allows users to access their mail from anywhere on the Internet. With IMAP, mail is delivered to the server and stored in a remote mailbox, remaining accessible from any device.

**Key Features of IMAP:**
- Persistent connections that keep the mail on the server until the user deletes it.
- Users can request message headers, specific message bodies, or search for messages meeting certain criteria.
- Messages are downloaded as the user opens them, maintaining a persistent connection.

### User Interaction with Mail Service

Mail is delivered to the final recipient using a mail user agent (MUA), commonly known as an "email client" or "email application." These clients run on each user’s local computer and must be configured to send messages to the correct outgoing server and receive messages from the incoming server. Proper configuration can affect the server’s processing load and available storage space.

### Mail Storage Locations

#### Outgoing Mail Location

Outgoing mail messages are temporarily stored in the following spool directory on the startup disk:
```
/var/spool/postfix
```
This location can be moved to any accessible volume (local or NFS mounted) and symlinked by the mail administrator.

#### Incoming Mail Location

Incoming mail is stored on the startup disk in the following directory:
```
/var/spool/imap/[user name]
```
Cyrus maintains a database index file in the folder of user messages. You can change the location of mail folders and database indexes to another folder, disk, or partition, or even to a shared volume on another server, though this may impact performance.

### Maximum Number of Mail Messages per Volume

The number of messages that can be stored on a volume is determined by the total number of files that can be stored. For example, a 4 GB HFS Plus volume with a default block size of 4KB can hold up to one million 4KB files, meaning it can store one million email messages of 4KB or less. Larger volumes can hold proportionally more files.

### What Mail Service Doesn’t Do

Mac OS X Server’s mail service does not provide:
- Virus filtering
- Spam identification
- Email content filtering

These add-on services can be configured to work with Mac OS X Server’s mail service and are available from various developers.

### Using Network Services with Mail Service

Mail service relies on network services, particularly DNS, to ensure email delivery. Before sending an email, the mail service uses DNS to determine the IP address of the destination. DNS services can be provided by your ISP or by Mac OS X Server.

### Configuring DNS for Mail Service

To enable MX records:
1. In Server Admin, select DNS in the Computers & Services pane.
2. Click Settings.
3. Select the Zones tab.
4. Select the Zone you want to use.
5. Click the Add button under the Records pane.
6. Choose MX from the Type pop-up menu.
7. Enter the domain name (e.g., `example.com`) in the From field.
8. Enter the name of the mail server (e.g., `mail.example.com`) in the To field.
9. If you have multiple mail servers, enter a precedence number. A lower number indicates higher priority.
10. Click OK.

### How Mail Service Uses SSL

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connections ensure that data sent between the mail server and mail clients is encrypted. SSL provides secure and confidential transport but does not handle authentication. For detailed instructions on enabling SSL, see the web technologies and Open Directory administration guides.

### Setting Up Mail Service

Before setting up mail service, decide whether to use POP, IMAP, or both for incoming mail. Ensure you have a registered domain name and determine if your ISP will create MX records or if you will create them in your own DNS service. Create user accounts for mail users, determine mail storage requirements, and plan for authentication and transport security needs.

### User Account Settings

Each user account has settings that:
- Enable or disable mail service, or forward incoming mail to another email address.
- Specify the server providing mail service.
- Set a quota on the amount of disk space for storing mail.
- Specify the protocol for incoming mail (POP, IMAP, or both).

### Moving Mail Messages from Apple Mail Server to Mac OS X Server Version 10.3

If upgrading from a previous version, migrate your mail database to Mac OS X Server v.10.3. See “Converting the Mail Store and Database From an Earlier Version” and “Using Amsmailtool” for detailed instructions.

### Overview of Mail Service Tools

- **Server Admin:** Start, stop, configure, and monitor mail service.
- **Workgroup Manager:** Create user accounts and configure mail options.
- **Terminal:** Use for tasks involving UNIX command-line tools.

### Setup Overview

You can set up mail service during the Mac OS X Server installation process. By default, SMTP, POP, and IMAP are active and use standard ports. Standard authentication methods are used, and mail is delivered locally. If you need to change this configuration, follow the steps outlined in the setup guide.

### Steps to Set Up Mail Service

1. **Plan Ahead:** Consider items like POP/IMAP, domain name, MX records, user accounts, and storage.
2. **Set Up MX Records:** Configure DNS with appropriate MX records.
3. **Configure Incoming Mail Service:** Set up POP and IMAP settings.
4. **Configure Outgoing Mail Service:** Set up SMTP settings.
5. **Secure Your Server:** Prevent open relays and limit spam.
6. **Configure Additional Settings:** Adjust mail storage, DNS interaction, and spam handling.
7. **Set Up Accounts for Mail Users:** Create and configure user accounts.
8. **Create a Postmaster Account:** Optional but recommended.
9. **Start Mail Service:** Ensure correct date, time, and timezone settings.
10. **Set Up Each User’s Mail Client Software:** Provide necessary configuration details to users.

For detailed instructions on each step, refer to the respective sections in the setup guide.
