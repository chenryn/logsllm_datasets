History: hacking voicemail systems
• When?
• In the 80s
• What?
• Mostly unused boxes that were part of business or cellular phone systems
• Why?
• As an alternative to BSS
• Used as a "home base" for communication
• Provided a safe phone number for phreaks to give out to one another

Hacking Answering Machines 1990 by Predat0r
“There is also the old "change the message" secret 
to make it say something to the effect of this line 
accepts all toll charges so you can bill third party 
calls to that number”
Hacking Telephone Answering Machines by Doctor Pizz and Cybersperm
“You can just enter all 2-digit combinations until 
you get the right one”  
… 
“A more sophisticated and fast way to do this is to 
take advantage of the fact that such machines 
typically do not read two numbers at a time, and 
discard them, but just look for the correct 
sequence”
Hacking AT&T Answering Machines Quick and Dirty by oleBuzzard
“Quickly Enter the following string: 
1234567898765432135792468642973147419336699

040506070809001 
(this is the shortest string for entering every 
possible 2-digit combo.)”

Impact
so what?
What happens if you 
don’t pick up?
Voicemail takes the 
call and records it!
Attack vector
1. Bruteforce voicemail system, ideally using backdoor numbers
2. Ensure calls go straight to voicemail (call ﬂooding, OSINT, 
HLR records)
3. Start password reset process using “call me” feature
4. Listen to the recorded message containing the secret code
5. Proﬁt!
voicemailcracker.py can do all this for you!

• The greeting message

We can record DTMF 
tones as the greeting 
message!
Attack vector
1. Bruteforce voicemail system, ideally using backdoor numbers
2. Update greeting message according to the account to be hacked
3. Ensure calls go straight to voicemail (call ﬂooding, OSINT, HLR 
records)
4. Start password reset process using “call me” feature
5. Listen to the recorded message containing the secret code

Recommendations
Recommendations for online services
• Don’t use automated calls (or SMS) for security purposes
• If not possible, detect answering machine and fail
• Require user interaction before giving the secret
•
with the hope that carriers ban DTMF tones from greeting messages
Recommendations for carriers
• Voicemail disabled by default
• and can only be activated from the actual phone or online
• No default PIN
• Don’t allow common PINs
• Detect abuse and bruteforce attempts
• Don’t process multiple PINs at once
• Eliminate backdoor voicemail services 
• or don’t allow access to login prompt from them
Recommendations for you
• Disable voicemail
• or use longest possible, random PIN
• Don’t provide phone number to online services unless 
strictly required
• Use only 2FA apps
TL;DR
Automated phone calls are a common solution for password reset, 2FA 
and veriﬁcation services. These can be compromised by leveraging old 
weaknesses and current technology to exploit the weakest link, 
voicemail systems
Strong password policy
2FA enforced
A+ in OWASP Top 10 checklist
