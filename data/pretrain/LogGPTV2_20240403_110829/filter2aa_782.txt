## Introduction
- **Amstrad CPC 6128**: Captured while playing “La Abadía del Crímen”

## Historical Context
- **1983**: The "Voice Mail" patent is granted.
- **1980s**: Hacking voicemail systems began as an alternative to BSS (Bulletin Board Systems).
  - **Purpose**: 
    - As a "home base" for communication.
    - Provided a safe phone number for phreaks to share with each other.

### Early Techniques
- **Hacking Answering Machines (1990) by Predat0r**:
  - "Change the message" trick to make it say, "This line accepts all toll charges."
  
- **Hacking Telephone Answering Machines by Doctor Pizz and Cybersperm**:
  - Enter all 2-digit combinations until the correct one is found.
  - More sophisticated methods involve exploiting the machine's inability to read two numbers at a time.

- **Hacking AT&T Answering Machines Quick and Dirty by oleBuzzard**:
  - Use a string that includes every possible 2-digit combination.

- **A Tutorial of Aspen Voice Mailbox Systems by Slycath**:
  - Default passwords and common hacking techniques.

## Voicemail Security in the 1980s
- **Default and Common Passwords**
- **Bruteforceable Passwords**
- **Efficient Bruteforcing by Sending Multiple Passwords at Once**
- **Greeting Message as an Attack Vector**

## Voicemail Security Today
- **Checklist**:
  - **Default Passwords**
  - **Common Passwords**
  - **Bruteforceable Passwords**
  - **Efficient Bruteforcing by Entering Multiple Passwords at Once**
  - **Greeting Message as an Attack Vector**

### Carrier-Specific Defaults
- **AT&T**: 111111
- **T-Mobile**: Last four digits of the phone number
- **Sprint**: Last seven digits of the phone number
- **Verizon**: Last four digits of the phone number (source: verizon.com/support/smallbusiness/phone/setupphone.htm)

### Research Study (2012)
- **Data Genetics**: Analyzed password patterns and security vulnerabilities.

## Tool: `voicemailcracker.py`
- **Features**:
  - **Fast**: Uses Twilio’s services to make hundreds of calls at a time.
  - **Cheap**: Entire 4-digit keyspace for $40, 50% chance of guessing a 4-digit PIN for $5.
  - **Easy**: Fully automated, configured with specific payloads for major carriers.
  - **Efficient**: Optimizes bruteforcing, tries multiple PINs in the same call.
  - **Undetected**: Calls go straight to voicemail, can be made when the phone is offline.

### Backdoor Voicemail Numbers
- **AT&T**: 408-307-5049
- **Verizon**: 301-802-6245
- **T-Mobile**: 805-637-7243
- **Sprint**: 513-225-6245

## Impact
- **What Happens if You Don’t Pick Up?**
  - Voicemail takes the call and records it.
  - **Attack Vector**:
    1. Bruteforce the voicemail system using backdoor numbers.
    2. Ensure calls go straight to voicemail (call flooding, OSINT, HLR records).
    3. Start the password reset process using the "call me" feature.
    4. Listen to the recorded message containing the secret code.
    5. Profit!

## User Interaction Based Protection
- **Hint**: Record DTMF tones as the greeting message.
- **Attack Vector**:
  1. Bruteforce the voicemail system using backdoor numbers.
  2. Update the greeting message according to the account to be hacked.
  3. Ensure calls go straight to voicemail.
  4. Start the password reset process using the "call me" feature.
  5. Listen to the recorded message containing the secret code.
  6. Profit!

## Vulnerable Services
- **Password Reset**
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
- **Verification**

## Open Source: `voicemailcracker.py` Limited Edition
- **Features**:
  - Support for one carrier only.
  - No bruteforcing.
  - Change greeting message with specially crafted payloads.
  - Retrieve messages containing secret temp codes.
- **Git Repo**: [GitHub](https://github.com/martinvigo)

## Recommendations
### For Online Services
- **Avoid Automated Calls for Security Purposes**.
- **Detect Answering Machine and Fail**.
- **Require User Interaction Before Giving the Secret**.
- **Hope Carriers Ban DTMF Tones from Greeting Messages**.

### For Carriers
- **Disable Voicemail by Default**.
- **No Default PIN**.
- **Disallow Common PINs**.
- **Detect Abuse and Bruteforce Attempts**.
- **Do Not Process Multiple PINs at Once**.
- **Eliminate Backdoor Voicemail Services**.

### For Users
- **Disable Voicemail** or use the longest possible, random PIN.
- **Provide Phone Number Only When Strictly Required**.
- **Use 2FA Apps**.

## Conclusion
- **TL;DR**: Automated phone calls are a common solution for password reset, 2FA, and verification services. These can be compromised by leveraging old weaknesses and current technology to exploit the weakest link: voicemail systems.
