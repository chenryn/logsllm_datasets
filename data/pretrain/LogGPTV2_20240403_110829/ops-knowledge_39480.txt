User: I'm on OSX, and I installed IDLE for Python 3.4. However, in Terminal my python -V and pip --version are both Python 2.7. 
How do I fix this? I really have no idea how any of this works, so please bear with my lack of knowledge.
Assistant: I have found that making the 'python' alias replace the default version of python that the system comes with is a bad idea.
When you install a new version of python (3.4 for instance), 
these two new commands are installed, specifically for the version you installed:
pip3.4
python3.4
If you're using an IDE that wants you to indicate which python version you are using the IDE will let you navigate to it in the Library folder
pip will still be for python2.7 after you download some other python version, as I think that's the current version osx comes installed with
