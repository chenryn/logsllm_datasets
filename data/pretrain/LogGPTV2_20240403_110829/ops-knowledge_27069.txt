**Question: Configuring Apache to Use Custom Log Formats Based on Conditions**

I am seeking a method to configure Apache to log all client information using a custom log format, particularly when certain websites are accessed through a reverse proxy. 

Currently, I have configured the log format as follows:

```apache
LogFormat "%h %{X-Forwarded-For}i %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" combined
```

However, this log format is not compatible with AWStats for processing.

My idea is to use two different log formats:

1. **Combined Log Format:**
   ```apache
   LogFormat "%h %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" combined
   ```

2. **Reverse Proxy Log Format:**
   ```apache
   LogFormat "%{X-Forwarded-For}i %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" reverseproxy
   ```

I would like to implement a conditional logic where if the request comes from a specific IP address (e.g., 1.1.1.1, which is my reverse proxy), Apache should use the `reverseproxy` log format. Otherwise, it should use the `combined` log format.

Is there a way to achieve this in Apache? I am looking for an expert's advice on how to set this up.

**Expert Reply:**

You can indeed achieve this by using conditional logging in Apache. The documentation provides a good example of how to do this. You can refer to the "Conditional Logs" section in the Apache documentation: [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/logs.html#accesslog](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/logs.html#accesslog).

Here is an example configuration that you can use:

1. Define your log formats:
   ```apache
   LogFormat "%h %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" combined
   LogFormat "%{X-Forwarded-For}i %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" reverseproxy
   ```

2. Set up the conditional logging:
   ```apache
   <IfModule mod_log_config.c>
       CustomLog logs/access_log combined
       <If "%{REMOTE_ADDR} == '1.1.1.1'">
           CustomLog logs/access_log reverseproxy
       </If>
   </IfModule>
   ```

In this configuration, the `CustomLog` directive is used to specify the default log format (`combined`). The `<If>` block checks if the `REMOTE_ADDR` matches the IP address of your reverse proxy (1.1.1.1). If it does, it overrides the log format to `reverseproxy`.

This setup should allow you to log requests based on the source IP address, ensuring that requests from your reverse proxy are logged in the desired format.
