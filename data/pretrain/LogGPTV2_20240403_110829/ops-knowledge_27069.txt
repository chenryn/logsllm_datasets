User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to configure and force apache to use custom logformat based on condition i'm looking for a way to force apache server to log all client info based on custom logformat.

the issue arise when there are certain website were access through a reverse proxy. so have configure the logformat to be as follow:


  LogFormat "%h %{X-Forwarded-For}i %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\"
  \"%{User-Agent}i\"" combined


but the logs are not be able to be process by awstat. what i am thinking is, can we do have two logformat.


  LogFormat "%h %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\""
  combined LogFormat "%{X-Forwarded-For}i %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b
  \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" reverseproxy


and having some variable like if else condition. for example if i see request coming from 1.1.1.1 which is my reverse proxy ip then apache need to use reverseproxy logformat.

looking for expert reply.

Assistant: You have exactly the example you need in the documentation: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/logs.html#accesslog

See the "Conditional Logs" section.
