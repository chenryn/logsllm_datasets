User: We have phone recording software running on a windows 7 box. We run a python script that tells a audio converter program sox, to convert the calls to mp3 format. 
When we run the script by double clicking it, it works fine. But when we run it through the windows task scheduler, we get the error message.
'Sox is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.'
Any one have any insight on this issue.
Assistant: You should add the program's full path or add the proper directory to your environment's PATH variable.
