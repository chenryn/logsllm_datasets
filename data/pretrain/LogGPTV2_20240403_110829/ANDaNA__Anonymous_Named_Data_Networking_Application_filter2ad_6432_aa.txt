## Abstract
Content-centric networking (CCN), also known as Information-Centric Networking (ICN), shifts the focus from hosts and interfaces to data. In this paradigm, named data becomes addressable and routable, while the locations storing the data become irrelevant to applications.

Named Data Networking (NDN) is a prominent research effort that exemplifies the content-centric approach. NDN inherently includes privacy-friendly features, such as the absence of source and destination addresses in packets. However, it also raises privacy concerns, primarily due to the semantic richness of names. This paper examines the privacy-relevant characteristics of NDN and presents an initial attempt to achieve communication privacy. Specifically, we design an NDN add-on tool, called ANDaNA, which borrows several features from Tor. Our experiments demonstrate that ANDaNA provides comparable anonymity with lower relative overhead compared to Tor.

## 1. Introduction
The Internet, despite its global success, is showing signs of age. Developed in the 1970s, the TCP/IP suite was groundbreaking but focused on a point-to-point communication model similar to telephony. Today's Internet must accommodate information-intensive services, vast amounts of content, and a variety of mobile devices. To address these challenges, new Internet architectures are being researched. 

Named-Data Networking (NDN) is one such effort, exemplifying the content-centric approach. NDN names content instead of locations, transforming content into a first-class entity. Each piece of content must be signed by its producer, allowing for automatic caching and efficient use of multiple network interfaces. However, NDN introduces privacy challenges that need to be addressed for it to be a viable candidate for the future Internet architecture.

We view anonymity as a critical feature in any new network architecture. Anonymity helps people overcome communication restrictions, evade censorship, and deploy applications like e-cash or anonymous publishing. While NDN lacks source/destination addresses, which aids privacy, it still faces significant privacy challenges:

1. **Name Privacy**: NDN content names are semantically related to the content, revealing more information than IP addresses.
2. **Content Privacy**: Any entity that knows a name can retrieve the corresponding content, making encryption for public content ineffective.
3. **Cache Privacy**: Network neighbors can infer content access using timing information.
4. **Signature Privacy**: Digital signatures in NDN content packets are publicly verifiable, potentially leaking sensitive information.

In this paper, we present ANDaNA, an adaptation of onion routing to NDN. Our approach aligns with NDN principles, leveraging its strengths and mitigating its weaknesses. We optimized ANDaNA for small- to medium-size interactive communication, such as web browsing and instant messaging. We provide a security analysis under a realistic adversarial model, showing that ANDaNA maintains anonymity and unlinkability with fewer anonymizing router hops than Tor. Our prototype and experimental results demonstrate that ANDaNA introduces less overhead, especially for anticipated traffic patterns.

This work is timely and important due to the growing interest in content-centric networking and the early stage of NDN development. Before delving into the details, we provide further motivation for our approach.

### Why NDN?
NDN stands out among content-centric architectures for several reasons:
1. It combines revolutionary ideas about content-based routing, attracting significant attention from the networking research community.
2. It builds upon the open-source CCNx codebase, maintained by PARC.
3. NDN is one of the few content-centric proposals with a mature prototype available to researchers.
4. It is one of four projects selected by the NSF Future Internet Architectures (FIA) program.

While NDN is an ongoing research project, it represents a good example of content-centric networking. The ideas and techniques discussed in this paper are applicable to a wide range of network designs.

### Approach
NDN follows the "thin waist" principle of IP, meaning that pushing non-essential services into the core would contradict its design. Therefore, privacy tools should run on top of NDN. Onion routing, exemplified by Tor, is a well-established approach for anonymity in today's Internet. Our approach, ANDaNA, adapts onion routing to NDN, addressing the unique challenges of NDN.

### Scope
This paper focuses on privacy, assuming other NDN security features. Topics such as trust management, certification, and routing security are out of scope.

## 2. NDN Overview
NDN is a communication architecture based on named content. Content is referred to by name rather than location. A content name consists of one or more variable-length components, delimited by "/". For example, a CNN news content might be named: `/ndn/cnn/news/2011aug20`.

Large pieces of content can be split into fragments with predictable names, such as `/ndn/youtube/videos/video-749.avi/137` for fragment 137 of a YouTube video.

NDN does not have an explicit notion of "hosts." Communication follows a pull model: content is delivered to consumers only upon request. Consumers send interest packets, and if an entity (router or host) can satisfy the interest, it returns the corresponding content packet. Interest and content are the only types of packets in NDN. A content packet is never forwarded unless preceded by an interest for the same name.

Routers store state information for each forwarded interest, including the name and the interface on which it was received. If an interest for the same name arrives, the router collapses the interests, storing only the interface. When content is returned, the router forwards it out on all interfaces where the interest was received and flushes the corresponding PIT entry.

NDN supports content caching, allowing popular content to be served from distributed caches. Content authenticity and integrity are ensured through mandatory digital signatures. Producers publish new content, and consumers request it. Although content signature verification is optional, a signature must be verifiable by any NDN entity. Public keys are treated as regular content, forming a "certificate."

Private or restricted content is protected via encryption by the publisher. Once content is distributed unencrypted, there is no mechanism to apply subsequent encryption. NDN does not currently allow consumers to selectively conceal content corresponding to their interests.

From a privacy perspective, the lack of source and destination addresses in NDN packets is an advantage. Eavesdropping on a link close to a content producer cannot immediately identify the consumer. Additionally, content caching and collapsing of redundant interests reduce the utility of eavesdropping.
