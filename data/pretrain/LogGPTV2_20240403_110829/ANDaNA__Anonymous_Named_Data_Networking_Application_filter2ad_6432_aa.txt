Abstract
Content-centric networking — also known as
information-centric networking (ICN) — shifts empha-
sis from hosts and interfaces (as in today’s Internet) to
data. Named data becomes addressable and routable,
while locations that currently store that data become ir-
relevant to applications.
Named Data Networking (NDN) is a large collabora-
tive research effort that exempliﬁes the content-centric
approach to networking. NDN has some innate privacy-
friendly features, such as lack of source and destina-
tion addresses on packets. However, as discussed in
this paper, NDN architecture prompts some privacy con-
cerns mainly stemming from the semantic richness of
names. We examine privacy-relevant characteristics of
NDN and present an initial attempt to achieve communi-
cation privacy. Speciﬁcally, we design an NDN add-on
tool, called ANDaNA, that borrows a number of features
from Tor. As we demonstrate via experiments, it provides
comparable anonymity with lower relative overhead.

Introduction
Although the Internet, as a whole, is a huge global
In the
success story, it is showing clear signs of age.
1970s, when core ideas underlying today’s Internet were
developed, telephony was the only example of effec-
tive global-scale communications. Thus, while the com-
munication solution offered by the Internet’s TCP/IP
suite was unique and ground-breaking, the communica-
tion paradigm it focused on was similar to that of tele-
phony: a point-to-point conversation between two en-
tities. The communication world has changed dramat-
ically since then and today’s Internet has to accommo-
date:
information-intensive services, exabytes of con-
tent created and consumed daily over the Web as well as
a menagerie of mobile devices connected to it. To keep
pace with these changes and move the Internet into the
future, a number of research efforts to design new Inter-
net architectures have taken off in the last few years.
Named-Data Networking (NDN) [32] is one such ef-
fort that exempliﬁes the content-centric approach [23,
27, 28] to networking. NDN names content instead of
locations (i.e., hosts or interfaces) and thus transforms
content into a ﬁrst-class entity. NDN also stipulates that
each piece of content must be signed by its producer.
This allows decoupling of trust in content from trust in
the entity that might store and/or disseminate that con-
tent. These NDN features facilitate automatic caching of
content to optimize bandwidth use and enable effective
simultaneous utilization of multiple network interfaces.
However, NDN introduces certain challenges that
must be addressed in order for it to be a serious can-
didate for the future Internet architecture. One major
argument for a new architecture is the inadequate level
of security and privacy in today’s Internet. We view
anonymity as being a critical feature in any new network
architecture. It helps people overcome communication
restrictions and boundaries as well as evade censorship.
In addition, some applications (e.g., e-cash or anony-
mous publishing) can be successfully deployed only if
the underlying network allows users to hide their iden-
tity [14]. Even if end-users do not care about anonymity
with respect to services they access, they might still want
to hide their activities from employers, governments and
ISPs, since those might censor, misuse or accidentally
leak sensitive information [19].
Lack of source/destination addresses in NDN helps
privacy, since NDN packets carry information only
about what is requested but not who is requesting it.
However, a closer look reveals that this is insufﬁcient. In
particular, NDN design introduces three important pri-
vacy challenges:
1. Name privacy: NDN content names are incen-
tivized to be semantically related to the content it-
self. Similar to HTTP headers, names reveal sig-
niﬁcantly more information about content than IP
addresses. Moreover, an observer can easily de-
termine when two requests refer to the same (even
encrypted) content.
2. Content privacy: NDN allows any entity that
knows a name to retrieve corresponding content.
Encryption in NDN is used to enforce access con-
trol and is not applied to publicly available content.
Thus, consumers wanting to retrieve public content
cannot rely on encryption to hide what they access.
3. Cache privacy: as with current web proxies, net-
work neighbors may learn about each others’ con-
tent access using timing information to identify
cache hits.
4. Signature privacy:
since digital signatures in
NDN content packets are required to be publicly
veriﬁable, identity of a content signer may leak sen-
sitive information.
In this paper, we attempt to address these challenges. We
present an initial approach, called ANDaNA that can be
viewed as an adaptation of onion routing to NDN. Our
approach is in-line with NDN principles. It is designed
to take advantage of NDN strengths and work around
its weaknesses. We optimized ANDaNA for small- to
medium-size interactive communication – such as web-
browsing and instant messaging – that are characterized
by moderate amounts of low-latency trafﬁc [11].
We provide a security analysis of the proposed ap-
proach under a realistic adversarial model.
Specif-
ically, we deﬁne anonymity and unlinkability under
this security model and show that these properties hold
for ANDaNA. Moreover, ANDaNA is secure with fewer
anonymizing router hops than Tor. We prototyped
ANDaNA and assessed its performance via experiments
over a network testbed. Results show that ANDaNA in-
troduces less overhead than Tor, especially, for antici-
pated trafﬁc patterns.
We believe that this work is both timely and impor-
tant. The former – because of the recent surge of in-
terest in content-centric networking and NDN being a
good example of this paradigm. (Also, while NDN is
sufﬁciently mature to have a functional prototype suit-
able for experimental use, it is still at an early enough
stage to be open to change.) The latter – because it rep-
resents the ﬁrst attempt to identify and address privacy
problems in a viable candidate for the future Internet ar-
chitecture.
Before discussing details of our approach, we present
further motivation for this work.
Why NDN? There are multiple efforts to develop new
content-centric architectures and NDN is only one of
those. We focus on NDN because it stands out in sev-
eral aspects. First, it combines some revolutionary ideas
about content-based routing that have attracted consider-
able attention from the networking research community.
Second, it builds upon an open-source code-base called
CCNx [12], that is led and continuously maintained by
an industrial research lab (PARC). At the time of this
writing (summer 2011), NDN is one of the very few
content-centric architectural proposals with a reasonably
mature prototype available to the research community.1
Third, NDN is one of only four projects selected by NSF
Future Internet Architectures (FIA) program [20].
On the other hand, NDN is an on-going research
project and is thus subject to continuous change. How-
ever, we believe that it represents a good example of
content-centric networking design and at least some of
its concepts will inﬂuence the future of networking.
More importantly, ideas, techniques and analysis dis-
cussed in this paper are not speciﬁc, or limited to, NDN;
they are applicable to a wide range of designs, including
host-, location- and content-addressable networks.
Approach. NDN follows the proven design principle
of IP and claims to be the “thin waist” of the communi-
cations protocol stack. Thus, pushing security or privacy
services (that are not critical for all types of communica-
tion) into this thin waist would contradict its design prin-
ciple. Consequently, as in the case of IP, we believe that
privacy tools should run on top of NDN. Looking at pri-
vacy and anonymity techniques in today’s Internet, one
well-established approach is an overlay anonymization
network, exempliﬁed by Tor [18]. Tor and its relatives
employ layers of concentric encryption and intermedi-
ate nodes responsible for peeling off layers as packets
travel through the overlay. This is commonly referred
to as onion routing. Our approach falls into roughly the
same category. However, as we discover and discuss in
this paper, the task of adapting an anonymization over-
lay approach to NDN is not as simple as it might initially
seem.
Scope.
The primary focus of this paper is privacy.
Security and other features of NDN are taken as given
without justifying their existence. A number of impor-
tant NDN-related security topics are out of scope of this
paper, including: trust management, certiﬁcation and re-
vocation of credentials as well as routing security.
Organization. We start with NDN overview and pri-
vacy analysis in Section 2. Section 3 summarizes related
work, followed by the description of ANDaNA in Sec-
tion 4. Section 5 introduces a formal model for provable
anonymity and security analysis of ANDaNA. Implemen-
tation details and performance evaluation results are dis-
cussed in Section 6. The paper concludes in Section 7.
2 NDN Overview
NDN [32] is a communication architecture based
on named content.2 Rather than addressing content
by its location, NDN refers to it by name. Content
name is composed of one or more variable-length com-
ponents that are opaque to the network. Component
1We are aware of only two other content-centric architecture pro-
posals – [33] and [36] – that have public prototypes.
2Note that we use the terms ”content” and ”data” interchangeably
throughout this paper.
boundaries are explicitly delimited by “/”. For ex-
ample, the name of a CNN news content might be:
/ndn/cnn/news/2011aug20. Large pieces of con-
tent can be split into fragments with predictable names:
fragment 137 of a YouTube video could be named:
/ndn/youtube/videos/video-749.avi/137.
Since the main abstraction is content, there is no ex-
plicit notion of “hosts” in NDN. (However, their exis-
tence is assumed.) Communication adheres to the pull
model: content is delivered to consumers only upon ex-
plicit request. A consumer requests content by sending
an interest packet. If an entity (a router or a host) can
“satisfy” a given interest, it returns the corresponding
content packet. Interest and content are the only types
of packets in NDN. A content packet with name X in
NDN is never forwarded or routed unless it is preceded
by an interest for name X.3
When a router receives an interest for name X and
there are no pending interests for the same name in its
PIT (Pending Interests Table), it forwards this interest to
the next hop according to its routing table. For each for-
warded interest, a router stores some state information,
including the name in the interest and the interface on
which it was received. However, if an interest for X ar-
rives while there is an entry for the same name in the PIT,
the router collapses the present interest (and any subse-
quent ones for X) storing only the interface on which it
was received. When content is returned, the router for-
wards it out on all interfaces where an interest for X has
been received and ﬂushes the corresponding PIT entry.
Note that, since no additional information is needed to
deliver content, an interest does not carry a source ad-
dress. More detailed discussion of NDN routing can be
found in [27].
In NDN, each network entity can provide content
caching, which is limited only by resource availabil-
ity. For popular content, this allows interests to be sat-
isﬁed from cached copies distributed over the network,
thus maximizing resource utilization. NDN deals with
content authenticity and integrity by making digital sig-
natures mandatory on all content packets. A signature
binds content with its name, and provides origin au-
thentication no matter how or from where it is retrieved.
NDN calls entities that publish new content producers.
Whereas, as follows from the above discussion, entities
that request content are called consumers. (Consumers
and producers are clearly overlapping sets.) Although
content signature veriﬁcation is optional in NDN, a sig-
nature must be veriﬁable by any NDN entity. To make
this possible, content packets carry additional metadata,
3Strictly speaking, content named X(cid:48) (cid:54)= X can be delivered in
response to an interest for X but only if X is a preﬁx of X(cid:48). As an
example, the full name of each content packet contains the hash of that
content; however, this hash value is usually not known to consumers
and is typically omitted from interests.
such as the ID of the content publisher and information
on locating the public key needed for veriﬁcation. Pub-
lic keys are treated as regular content: since all content
is signed, each public key content is effectively a “cer-
tiﬁcate”. NDN does not mandate any particular certiﬁ-
cation infrastructure, relegating trust management to in-
dividual applications.
Private or restricted content in NDN is protected via
encryption by the content publisher. Once content is dis-
tributed unencrypted, there is no mechanism to apply
subsequent encryption. Speciﬁc applications may pro-
vide a means to explicitly request encryption of content
by publishers. However, NDN does not currently allow
consumers to selectively conceal content corresponding
to their interests.
From the privacy perspective, lack of source and des-
tination addresses in NDN packets is a clear advantage
over IP. In practice, this means that the adversary that
eavesdrops on a link close to a content producer can not
immediately identify the consumer(s) who expressed in-
terest in that content. Moreover, two features of standard
NDN routers: (1) content caching and (2) collapsing of
redundant interests, reduce the utility of eavesdropping
