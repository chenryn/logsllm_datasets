User: Does anyone know where or how to set the default path/directory on saving python scripts prior to running?  
On a Mac it wants to save them in the top level ~/Documents directory. I would like to specify a real location. Any ideas?
Assistant: I actually just discovered the easiest answer, if you use the shortcut link labeled "IDLE (Python GUI)". This is in Windows Vista, so I don't know if it'll work in other OS's.
1) Right-click "Properties".
2) Select "Shortcut" tab.
3) In "Start In", write file path (e.g. "C:\Users...").
Let me know if this works!
