### Abstract
This paper investigates the prevalence of third-party tracking on the mobile web. Our survey of 100 popular mobile versions of web applications reveals that 62 sites are tracking user activities, with Google Analytics being the most widely used tracker. This study aims to raise awareness about the extent of third-party tracking in the mobile web environment.

## 1. Introduction
Several studies have examined third-party tracking on desktop-based web applications [1, 2, 3], which has often been a topic of public and privacy debates [4, 5]. However, there is a lack of research on third-party tracking in mobile web applications. Mobile web URLs typically start with "m" or end with "mobile" or "mobi" (e.g., http://m.pinterest.com). These sites usually present a simplified and optimized version of their desktop counterparts.

This paper presents a survey of 100 popular mobile web applications to assess the prevalence of third-party tracking code. The surveyed sites include well-known names such as Nokia, Pinterest, Vodafone, BBC News, CNN, Twitter, YouTube, Intel, Answers, Dictionary, and Etsy. We found third-party tracking code on 62 of these sites. Additionally, we identified 17 different trackers, with Google Analytics being the most prevalent, appearing on 41 sites, followed by ScorecardResearch on 23 sites.

## 2. Related Work
To our knowledge, all existing quantitative overviews of third-party tracking [1, 2, 3] focus on desktop-based web applications. Our study provides the first detailed insight into the current state of third-party tracking on mobile web applications.

## 3. Survey

### 3.1 General Approach
We surveyed 100 mobile versions of web applications and manually analyzed the source code of their homepages. The complete list of surveyed sites is available at [http://pastebin.com/jeEJp7GW](http://pastebin.com/jeEJp7GW). Mobile sites generally offer a simpler and more optimized version of their desktop counterparts, with fewer features and less content. Despite their simplicity, the amount of third-party tracking code on mobile web applications is surprisingly high and warrants attention.

### 3.2 Prevalence of Third-Party Tracking
Our investigation of the 100 popular mobile sites revealed that 62 sites are using tracking code to monitor users' browsing activities. These sites include SoundCloud, Pinterest, BBC News, CNN, MySpace, Dictionary, and Answers. The complete list of mobile sites that track user activities is available at [http://pastebin.com/qK4N0vbS](http://pastebin.com/qK4N0vbS).

### 3.3 Trackers on Mobile Web
We identified 17 unique third-party trackers across the 100 mobile web applications. Table 1 summarizes the trackers and their footprints.

| **Third-Party Tracker** | **Footprint** |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| Google Analytics         | 41            |
| ScorecardResearch       | 23            |
| Omniture                | 7             |
| Quantcast               | 4             |
| GoogleSyndication       | 3             |
| AddThis                 | 2             |
| EffectiveMeasure        | 2             |

Other trackers, such as Statcounter, Admob, Seevolution, Moblama, Adreacter, MADS, Mobilytics, Kissmetrics, Imrworldwide, and Akamai, were each found on one mobile application.

### 3.4 Tracking Code
Most trackers on mobile sites use JavaScript for tracking. Some also employ Web Beacons, which are 1x1 pixel images used for tracking. According to the Network Advertising Initiative [14], Web Beacons can deliver cookies in a third-party context, enabling tasks such as visitor counts, web usage patterns, ad campaign assessments, and content tailoring.

For example, the following snippet was found on [http://m.wund.com/](http://m.wund.com/):

```html
<img src="http://example.com/beacon.gif" width="1" height="1">
```

In this case, the site places a Web Beacon in an `<img>` tag to ensure tracking remains active even if the user's mobile browser does not support JavaScript or if it is blocked.

### 3.5 Rating Trackers
We used Privacychoice’s privacyscore rating system [16] to classify the third-party trackers found on the mobile web. A privacyscore assesses the privacy risk of using a third-party tracker, assigning values between 0 and 50. Different color schemes indicate "comfort," "caution," or "concern." Table 2 shows the trackers along with their privacyscores (if available).

| **Tracker**              | **Score (Total 50)** | **Description**   |
|--------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| AddThis                  | 50                   | Comfort           |
| EffectiveMeasure         | 50                   | Comfort           |
| Omniture                 | No privacyscore      | -                 |
| Quantcast                | 50                   | Comfort           |
| Google Analytics         | 50                   | Comfort           |
| ScorecardResearch        | 40                   | Caution           |
| GoogleSyndication        | 25                   | Concern           |
| Mobilytics               | 0                    | Comfort           |
| Kissmetrics              | -                    | -                 |
| Imrworldwide             | -                    | -                 |
| Moblama                  | -                    | -                 |
| Adreacter                | -                    | -                 |
| MADS                     | -                    | -                 |
| StatCounter              | 25                   | Concern           |
| Admob                    | 50                   | Comfort           |
| Seevolution              | 25                   | Caution           |
| Akamai                   | 50                   | Comfort           |
