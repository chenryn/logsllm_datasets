ABSTRACT
In this paper, we investigate the footprints of third-party
tracking on the mobile web. The survey of 100 popular mo-
bile versions of web applications indicates that third-party
tracking is also prevalent on mobile web. The results show
that 62 sites are tracking users’ activities on mobile web and
Google Analytics is the most widespread tracker on mobile
web. We believe that this study will help raise awareness
about the tracking situation on the mobile web side.

INTRODUCTION
Researchers have conducted several studies in order to see
third-party tracking situation on desktop-based web appli-
cations [1, 2, 3] and this is often an agenda of public/ privacy
debate [4, 5]. The motivation for this work comes from
the observation that the mobile-based web applications or
mobile web still lacks research community’s knowledge on
third-party tracking. The URLs of mobile-based web appli-
cations start with the letter “m”, or end in the words “mobi”
or “mobile’ e.g., http://m.pinterest.com. Sites typically
present a simple and optimized version of web application
on the mobile side.
This paper presents a survey of 100 popular mobile-based
web applications. The goal of this survey is to see the preva-
lence of third-party tracking code on mobile web. The in-
spected sites includes names like Nokia, Pinterest, Vodafone,

BBCNews, CNN, Twitter, Youtube, Intel, Answers, Dictio-
nary and Etsy etc. We found third-party tracking code on
62 sites (see Section 3.2). We found 17 diﬀerent trackers
(see Section 3.3) on the considered mobile sites. Google An-
alytics [6] is the most widespread tracker having footprints
on 41 mobile sites followed by ScorecardResearch [7] with its
footing on 23 mobile versions of web applications.
2. RELATED WORK
To the best of our knowledge, all quantitative overviews
[1, 2, 3] on third-party tracking we are aware of are related
to desktop based web applications. Our study provides a
ﬁrst insight into the current prevalence of third-party track-
ing on the mobile versions of web applications.
3. SURVEY
3.1 General Approach
In this section, we discuss the approach used to gather
data. We have surveyed 100 mobile versions of web applica-
tions and manually analyze the source code of homepages of
mobile applications. The complete list of surveyed sites is
available at http://pastebin.com/jeEJp7GW. On the mo-
bile side, sites typically present a simple and optimized ver-
sion of their corresponding web applications. Mobile sites
have less features, less functionality and less contents as
compare to their desktop variants. Though mobile sites
are simple with less contents but the amount of third-party
tracking code we found on mobile versions of web applica-
tions is surprisingly high and requires attention.
3.2 Prevalence of Third-Party Tracking
Our investigation of the 100 popular mobile sites indicates
that 62 sites are using tracking code to monitor users’ brows-
ing activities on mobile web. It includes sites like Sound-
Cloud, Pinterest, BBCNews, CNN, MySpace, Dictionary
and Answers etc. The complete list of mobile sites that are
tracking users’ activities is available at http://pastebin.
com/qK4N0vbS.
3.3 Trackers on Mobile Web
We found 17 unique third-party trackers during survey of
100 mobile versions of web applications. Table 1 shows the
names of third-party trackers along with their footprints.

Table 1: Third-party Tracker on Mobile web along
with their footprints
There are other trackers like Statcounter1, Admob2, SeeVo-
lution3, Moblama4, Adreacter5, MADS6, Mobilytics7, Kiss-
metrics8, Imrworldwide9 and Akamai10 etc. We found their
footprints on one mobile application each.
3.4 Tracking Code
The majority of the trackers on mobile sites are using
JavaScript code for tracking purpose. We also found that
some of the trackers are using Web Beacons [13] alongside.
Web Beacon or web bug or clear GIF is a 1*1 (height*width)
image used for tracking purposes. According to Network Ad-
vertising Initiative [14]:
“Web beacons are a tool that can be used online to deliver
a cookie in a third-party context. This allows companies
to perform many important tasks—including unique visitor
counts, web usage patterns, assessments of the eﬃcacy of ad
campaigns, delivery of more relevant oﬀers, and tailoring of
web site content.”
The following snippet we found on site http://m.wund.
com/
In this case, the site places a web beacon in a 
tag. The main reason is to keep tracking active even if user’s
mobile browser does not support JavaScript or JavaScript is
blocked. Now we discuss some miscellaneous ﬁndings that
we consider worth mentioning:
• We found four (4) diﬀerent trackers on homepages of
the following mobile sites http://m.wund.com/, http:
//m.fark.com/ and m.cricbuzz.com/info/contact.

Figure 1: Rating system and examples from priva-
cychoice
• We found three unique third-party trackers on home-
pages of nine (9) mobile versions of web applications.
• According to recent report by Ghostery, Google An-
alytics is the most widespread tracker on web [15].
Our survey has found that Google Anayltics is also
widespread tracker on mobile side.
3.5 Rating Trackers
We use Privacychoice’s privacyscore rating system [16] for
the classiﬁcations of third-party trackers found on the mobile
web. A Privacyscore is a way to assess the privacy risk of us-
ing a third-party tracker [16]. Privacychoice’s privacyscore
rating system assigns values between zero to ﬁfty and use
diﬀerent color schemes for marking “comfort or caution or
concern” (see Fig. 1). For interested readers, we refer to [17]
for detailed description on Privacychoice’s privacyscore rat-
ing system. The Table. 2 shows third-party tracker along
with their privacyscore (if given). Unfortunately, we have
found no information about some mobile trackers regard-
ing their privacyscore reputation and some have a rating of
“concern” according to their privacyscore.
4. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have surveyed 100 mobile sites and found
tracking code on 62. We also found 17 unique third-party
trackers on 100 mobile versions of web applications. We
hope this paper will raise awareness about the third-party
tracking situation on mobile side.
