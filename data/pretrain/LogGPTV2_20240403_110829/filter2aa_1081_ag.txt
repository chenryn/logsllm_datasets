**Test 7, Part 2: Two JPG Files, One Deleted, Quick Format**

**Procedure:**
- A quick format of all drives from the previous test was performed using the evidence creation machine via eSATA.
- Drives were immediately safely removed from the system and imaged using a forensic write-blocker.
- File carving was run across each drive image to determine if either of the image files was still recoverable.

**Results:**
- After the quick format, both files were unrecoverable on the SSDs where the deleted file was unrecoverable or damaged during the previous test (Crucial, Intel, Samsung).
- Both files were recoverable from the other SSDs and the control hard drive.
  - Seagate HD: Both files recoverable
  - Crucial SSD: Not recoverable
  - Intel SSD: Not recoverable
  - OCZ SSD: Both files recoverable
  - Patriot SSD: Both files recoverable
  - Samsung SSD: Not recoverable
  - SuperTalent SSD: Both files recoverable

**Test 8, Part 1: Two JPG Files, 8 MB Partition, One Deleted**

**Procedure:**
- A single 8 MB partition was created on each drive, which was the smallest possible partition that Windows 7 would create on these drives.
- Two JPG files were saved to each drive using the evidence creation machine via eSATA. The evidence machine was running Windows 7 with TRIM support enabled.
- Once the files were copied to each drive, the drive was unmounted to ensure the files were written to disk.
- The disk was then re-mounted, and one file was deleted, leaving the second file untouched.
- The drive was immediately unmounted and connected to the write-blocker on the evidence collection machine and imaged.
- The image was then investigated to determine if the deleted image file was recoverable.

**Results:**
- The results were identical to the previous two-file test. The image was completely recoverable on only half of the SSDs.
- Both the Crucial and Intel SSDs performed garbage collection, rendering the deleted file unrecoverable.
- The file on the Samsung SSD was partially recoverable using file carving but was damaged, so a significant portion of the file was corrupt/missing.
  - Seagate HD: Recoverable
  - Crucial SSD: Not recoverable
  - Intel SSD: Not recoverable
  - OCZ SSD: Recoverable
  - Patriot SSD: Recoverable
  - Samsung SSD: Partially recoverable (file is damaged)
  - SuperTalent SSD: Recoverable

- Drives were immediately safely removed from the system and imaged using a forensic write-blocker.
- File carving was run across each drive image to determine if either of the image files was still recoverable.

**Results:**

  - Patriot SSD: Both files recoverable
  - Samsung SSD: Not recoverable
  - SuperTalent SSD: Both files recoverable

**Test 9, Part 1: Two Identical JPG Files, One Deleted**

**Procedure:**
- Two identical JPG files were saved to each drive using the evidence creation machine via eSATA. The evidence machine was running Windows 7 with TRIM support enabled.
- Once the files were copied to each drive, the drive was unmounted to ensure the files were written to disk.
- The disk was then re-mounted, and one file was deleted, leaving the second file untouched.
- The drive was immediately unmounted and connected to the write-blocker on the evidence collection machine and imaged.
- The image was then investigated to determine if the deleted image file was recoverable.

**Results:**
- The image was completely recoverable on only half of the SSDs.
- Both the Crucial and Intel SSDs performed garbage collection, rendering the deleted file unrecoverable.
- The file on the Samsung SSD was partially recoverable using file carving but was damaged, so a significant portion of the file was corrupt/missing.
  - Seagate HD: Recoverable
  - Crucial SSD: Not recoverable
  - Intel SSD: Not recoverable
  - OCZ SSD: Recoverable
  - Patriot SSD: Recoverable
  - Samsung SSD: Partially recoverable (file is damaged)
  - SuperTalent SSD: Recoverable

**Test 10, Part 1: 60 Numbered JPG Files, One Deleted Per Minute Over an Hour**

**Procedure:**
- Sixty numbered JPG files were created, each from an identical base image with a sequential number superimposed on the upper left corner of each image. The filenames corresponded to the number in the image.
- A simple PowerShell script was created to delete one image at a time sequentially every minute over the course of an hour.
- All JPG files were saved to each drive using the evidence creation machine via eSATA. The evidence machine was running Windows 7 with TRIM support enabled.
- Once the files were copied to each drive, the drive was unmounted to ensure the files were written to disk.
- The disk was then re-mounted, and the script was executed, allowing each image file to be deleted.
- Once the script completed execution, the drive was immediately unmounted and connected to the write-blocker on the evidence collection machine and imaged.
- The drive image was then investigated to determine which deleted image files were recoverable.

**Results:**
- The images were completely recoverable on only half of the SSDs.
- Both the Crucial and Intel SSDs performed garbage collection, rendering all of the deleted files unrecoverable.
- Most of the files on the Samsung SSD were not recoverable, but a few of the files were partially recoverable using file carving but were damaged, so a significant portion of each file was corrupt/missing.
  - Seagate HD: All recoverable
  - Crucial SSD: None recoverable
  - Intel SSD: None recoverable
  - OCZ SSD: All recoverable
  - Patriot SSD: All recoverable except for #1
  - Samsung SSD: Only six files were partially recoverable (damaged files), the rest were unrecoverable
  - SuperTalent SSD: All recoverable
