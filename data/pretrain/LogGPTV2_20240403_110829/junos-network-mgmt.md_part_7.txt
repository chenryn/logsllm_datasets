Configure Linktrace Protocol in CFM
The linktrace protocol is used for path discovery between a pair of maintenance points. Linktrace
messages are triggered by an administrator using the traceroute command to verify the path between a
pair of MEPs under the same maintenance association. Linktrace messages can also be used to verify
the path between an MEP and an MIP under the same maintenance domain. The linktrace protocol
enables you to configure the time to wait for a response. If no response is received for a linktrace
request message, the request and response entries are deleted after the interval expires. You can also
configure the number of linktrace reply entries to be stored for the corresponding linktrace request.
The operation of IEEE 802.1ag linktrace request and response messages is similar to the operation of
Layer 3 traceroute commands. For more information about the traceroute command, see the Junos OS
Administration Library for Routing Devices.
To configure the linktrace protocol:
1. Configure the time to wait for a linktrace response at the [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-
management] hierarchy level. You can specify the value in minutes or seconds. The default value is 10
minutes.

2. Configure the number of linktrace reply entries to be stored per linktrace request. You can specify a
value from 1 through 500. The default value is 100.

Continuity Check Protocol Parameters Overview
The continuity check protocol is used for fault detection by maintenance end points (MEPs) within a
maintenance association. The MEP periodically sends continuity check multicast messages. The
continuity check protocol packets use the ethertype value 0x8902 and the multicast destination MAC
address 01:80:c2:00:00:32.
The following list describes the continuity check protocol parameters you can configure:
• interval—Frequency of the continuity check messages (CCM) i.e time between the transmission of
the CCM messages. You can specify 10 minutes (10m), 1 minute (1m), 10 seconds (10s), 1 second (1s),
100 milliseconds (100ms), or 10 milliseconds (10ms). The default value is 1 minute. For instance, if you
specify the interval as 1 minute, the MEP sends the continuity check messages every minute to the
receiving MEP.
NOTE: For the continuity check message interval to be configured for 10 milliseconds,
periodic packet management (PPM) runs on the Routing Engine and Packet Forwarding
Engine by default. You can only disable PPM on the Packet Forwarding Engine. To disable
PPM on the Packet Forwarding Engine, use the no-delegate-processing statement at the [edit
routing-options ppm] hierarchy level.
Continuity check interval of 10 milliseconds is not supported for CFM sessions over a label-
switched interface (LSI).
• hold-interval—Frequency at which the MEP database can be flushed, if no updates occur. Receiving
MEPs use the continuity check messages to build a MEP database of all MEPs in the maintenance
association. The frequency is the number of minutes to wait before flushing the MEP database if no
updates occur. The default value is 10 minutes.
46
NOTE: Hold timer based flushing is applicable only for autodiscovered remote MEPs and not
for statically configured remote MEPs.
The hold interval logic runs a polling timer per CFM session level (not per remote MEP level) where
the polling timer duration is equal to the configured hold time. When the polling timer expires, it
deletes all the autodiscovered remote MEP entries which have been in the failed state for a time
period equal to or greater than the configured hold time. If the remote MEP completes the hold time
duration in the failed state, then flushing will not occur until the next polling timer expires. Hence
remote MEP flushing may not happen exactly at the configured hold time.
• loss-threshold—Number of continuity check messages that can be lost before the router marks the
MEP as down. The value can be from 3 to 256 protocol data units (PDUs). The default value is 3
PDUs.

Configuring Continuity Check Protocol Parameters for Fault Detection
The continuity check protocol is used for fault detection by a maintenance association end point (MEP)
within a maintenance association. A MEP periodically generates and responds to continuity check
multicast messages. The continuity check protocol packets use the ethertype value 0x8902 and the
multicast destination MAC address 01:80:c2:00:00:32. The receiving MEPs use the continuity check
messages (CCMs) to build a MEP database of all MEPs in the maintenance association.
To configure continuity check protocol parameters:
1. Specify the time to wait in minutes before flushing the MEP database, if no updates occur, with a
value from 1 minute through 30,240 minutes. The default value is 10 minutes.
47
NOTE: Flushing based on the hold timer is applicable only for autodiscovered remote MEPs
and not for statically configured remote MEPs.

the following values: 10 minutes (10m), 1 minute (1m), 10 seconds (10s), 1 second (1s), 100
milliseconds (100ms), or 10 milliseconds (10ms). The default value is 1 minute.

Configuring Rate Limiting of Ethernet OAM Messages
The M320 with Enhanced III FPC, M120, M7i, M10 with CFEB, and MX Series routers support rate
limiting of Ethernet OAM messages. Depending on the connectivity fault management (CFM)
configuration, CFM packets are discarded, sent to the CPU for processing, or flooded to other bridge
interfaces. This feature allows the router to intercept incoming CFM packets for prevention of DoS
attacks.
48
You can apply rate limiting of Ethernet OAM messages at either of two CFM policing levels, as follows:
• Global-level CFM policing—uses a policer at the global level to police the CFM traffic belonging to all
the sessions.
• Session-level CFM policing—uses a policer created to police the CFM traffic belonging to one
session.
To configure global-level CFM policing, include the policer statement and its options at the [edit protocols
oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management] hierarchy level.
To configure session-level CFM policing, include the policer statement at the [edit protocols oam ethernet
connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain md-name level number maintenance-association ma-name] hierarchy
level.
The following example shows a CFM policer used for rate-limiting CFM:
[edit]
firewall {
policer cfm-policer {
if-exceeding {
bandwidth-limit 8k;
burst-size-limit 2k;
}
then discard;
}
}
Case 1: Global-Level CFM Policing
This example shows a global level policer, at the CFM level, for rate-limiting CFM. The continuity-check
cfm-policer statement at the global [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management policer]
hierarchy level specifies the policer to use for policing all continuity check packets of the CFM traffic
belonging to all sessions. The other cfm-policer1 statement at the [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-
fault-management policer] hierarchy level specifies the policer to use for policing all non-continuity check
packets of the CFM traffic belonging to all sessions. The all cfm-policer2 statement specifies to police all
CFM packets with the specified policer cfm-policer2. If the all policer-name option is used, then the user
cannot specify the previous continuity-check and other options.
[edit protocols oam ethernet]
connectivity-fault-management {
policer {
continuity-check cfm-policer;
49
other cfm-policer1 ;
all cfm-policer2;
}
}
Case 2: Session-Level CFM Policing
This example shows a session-level CFM policer used for rate-limiting CFM. The policer statement at the
session [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain md-name maintenance-
association ma-name] hierarchy level specifies the policer to use for policing only continuity check packets
of the CFM traffic belonging to the specified session. The other cfm-policer1 statement at the [edit
protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain md-name maintenance-association ma-name]
hierarchy level specifies the policer to use for policing all non-continuity check packets of the CFM
traffic belonging to this session only. The all cfm-policer2 statement specifies to police all CFM packets
with the specified policer cfm-policer2. If the all policer-name option is used, then the user cannot specify
the previous continuity-check and other options.
[edit protocols oam ethernet]
connectivity-fault-management {
maintenance-domain md {

maintenance-association ma {

all cfm-policer2;
}
}
mep 1 {
interface ge-3/3/0.0;
direction up;
auto-discovery;
}
}
}
In the case of global CFM policing, the same policer is shared across multiple CFM sessions. In per-
session CFM policing, a separate policer must be created to rate-limit packets specific to that session.
50
NOTE: Service-level policer configuration for any two CFM sessions on the same interface at
different levels must satisfy the following constraints if the direction of the sessions is the same:
• If one session is configured with policer all, then the other session cannot have a policer all
or policer other configuration.
• If one session is configured with policer other, then the other session cannot have a policer all
or policer other configuration.
A commit error will occur if such a configuration is committed.
NOTE: Policers with PBB and MIPs are not supported.

Enabling Enhanced Connectivity Fault Management Mode
You can enable enhanced connectivity fault management (CFM) mode to enable effective Ethernet
OAM deployment in scaling networks. On enabling enhanced CFM mode, Junos OS supports 32, 000
maintenance association end points (MEPs) and maintenance intermediate points (MIPs) each per
chassis for bridge, VPLS, L2VPN, and CCC domains. In previous releases, Junos OS supports 8, 000
MEPs and 8000 MIPS per chassis. If you do not enable enhanced CFM, Junos OS continues to support
existing number of MIPs and MEPs per chassis.
NOTE: To support enhanced CFM mode, configure the network services mode on the router as
enhanced-ip. If the network services mode is not enhanced-ip, and you have enabled enhanced CFM,
the following warning message is displayed:
[edit protocols oam ethernet] 'connectivity-fault-management' enhanced ip is not effective please

Configure Connectivity Fault Management for Interoperability During Unified In-
Service Software Upgrades
Starting in Release 17.1, Junos OS connectivity fault management (CFM), during a unified in-service
software upgrade (ISSU), works when the peer device is not a Juniper Networks router. Interoperating
with the router of another vendor, the Juniper Networks router retains session information and
continues to transmit continuity check message (CCM) PDUs during the unified ISSU. Connectivity fault
management continues to operate.
This feature requires the following conditions be met:
• Packet Forwarding Engine keepalives must be enabled to provide inline transmission of CCMs. The
feature does not work when the CCMs are transmitted by the CPU of a line card, which is the default
transmission method.
• The interval between CCMs must be 1 second.
CFM interoperability during a unified ISSU is supported on the following MPCs: MPC1, MPC2, MPC2-
NG, MPC3-NG, MPC5, and MPC6.
To enable CFM interoperability with third-party devices across a unified ISSU:
1. Enable inline keepalives.
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring]

2. Set the CCM interval to 1 second.

Junos OS Support for Performance Monitoring Compliant with Technical Specification
MEF 36
Junos OS release 16.1R1 and later supports performance monitoring that is compliant with Technical
Specification MEF 36. Technical Specification MEF 36 specifies the performance monitoring MIB. The
performance monitoring MIB is required to manage service operations, administration, and maintenance
(OAM) implementations that satisfy the Service OAM requirements and framework specified in MEF 17
and MEF 35, the management objects specified in MEF 7.1, and the performance monitoring functions
defined in ITU-T Y.1731 and IEEE 802.1ag.
You can enable MEF-36-compliant performance monitoring by configuring the measurement-interval
statement at the [edit protocols oam ethernet cfm performance-monitoring] hierarchy level.
When MEF-36-compliant performance monitoring is enabled:
• An SNMP get next request for a variable might not fetch the current value unless an SNMP walk is
performed before performing the get next request. This limitation applies only to the current
statistics for delay measurement, loss measurement, and synthetic loss measurement.
• The output for the field Current delay measurement statistics might display a measurement interval of 0
(zero) and an incorrect timestamp until the first cycle time has expired.
• Supported data TLV size for performance monitoring protocol data units (PDUs) is 1386 bytes when
MEF-36-compliant performance monitoring is enabled. The TLV size is 1400 bytes in legacy mode.
• The maximum configurable value for the lower threshold bin is 4,294,967,294.
• Frame loss ratio (FLR) is excluded in loss measurements during period of unavailability for synthetic
loss measurement only. In case of loss measurement, FLR is included even during period of
unavailability.
• During a period of loss of continuity (adjacency down), although SOAM PDUs are not sent, FLR and
availability calculations are not stopped. These calculations are performed with the assumption of
100% loss.
• The number of SOAM PDUs that are sent during the first measurement interval might be less than
expected. This is because of a delay in detecting the adjacency state at the performance monitoring
session level.
• The number of SOAM PDUs transmitted during a measurement interval for a cycle time of 100 ms
might not be accurate. For example, in a measurement interval of two minutes with a cycle time
100 ms, the SOAM PDUs transmitted might be in the range of 1198—2000.

Damping CFM performance Monitoring Traps and Notifications to Prevent
Congestion of The NMS
You can dampen the performance monitoring threshold-crossing traps and notifications that are
generated every time a threshold-crossing event occurs to prevent congestion of the network
management system (NMS).
Damping limits the number of jnxSoamPmThresholdCrossingAlarm traps sent to the NMS by
summarizing the flap occurrences over a period of time, known as the flap trap timer, and sends a single
jnxSoamPmThresholdFlapAlarm notification to the NMS. You can configure the duration of the flap trap
timer to any value from 1 through 360 seconds.
The jnxSoamPmThresholdFlapAlarm notification is generated and sent when the following conditions
are met:
• At least one flap has occurred when the flap timer has expired.
• You changed the value of the flap trap timer, which caused the timer to stop.
You can enable damping at the global level for the iterator or you can enable damping at the individual
threshold type of the iterator. For instance, to enable damping at the global level, for the iterator, use
the following command: set protocols oam ethernet cfm performance-monitoring sla-iterator-profiles profile-
name flap-trap-monitor. To enable damping at a specific threshold type, for the avg-fd-twoway-threshold, use
the following command: set protocols oam ethernet cfm performance-monitoring sla-iterator-profiles profile-
name avg-fdv-twoway-threshold flap-trap-monitor.
You can also disable damping.

With growing networks, there is a requirement of monitoring a large number of services using CFM. To
monitor each service, one session per service logical interface is required. If the services are large in
number, this method does not scale as the number of sessions are limited. Instead of one CFM session
per service, a single CFM session can monitor multiple services.
56
Also, there are scenarios where the user-to-network interface (UNI) device needs to be brought down
based on sessions on network-to-network Interface (NNI) logical interface. Here, the NNI logical
interface refers to core interface and UNI physical interface refers to access interface hosting multiple
service logical interfaces. Based on core interface monitoring, you can bring down service logical
interfaces associated with access interface.
Figure 3 on page 56 illustrates a topology where a number of services destined to customer-edge (CE)
