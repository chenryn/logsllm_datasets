 **Migrated issue, originally created by Anonymous**
This issue occurs under the following circumstances:
  * When a relationship has the cascade property set to "all, delete-orphan",
  * There is a UniqueConstraint set on the child model
  * Simultaneously deleting and creating new child objects, through the backref on the parent, that have common values in the unique fields
I believe this is a bug, and that it can be fixed by first deleting the
removed children, followed by insertion of new children.
The following example recreates the issue on SQLAlchemy 0.8.1.
    from sqlalchemy import create_engine
    from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Float, UniqueConstraint, ForeignKey
    from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
    from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, relationship, backref
    from sqlalchemy.orm.dependency import OneToManyDP, attributes
    Base = declarative_base()
    class ParentEntity(Base):
        __tablename__ = 'parent'
        id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
        name = Column(String)
    class ChildEntity(Base):
        __tablename__ = 'child'
        __table_args__ = (UniqueConstraint('parent_id', 'z', name='child_uk'),)
        id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
        parent_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('parent.id'), nullable=False)
        z = Column(Float)
        parent = relationship("ParentEntity",
                              backref=backref("children",
                                              cascade="all, delete-orphan"))
    engine = create_engine('sqlite://', echo=True)
    Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
    sess = Session()
    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
    p = ParentEntity(name='Datum')
    p.children = [ChildEntity(z=3.5), ChildEntity(z=5.5)](ChildEntity(z=2.5),)
    sess.add(p)
    sess.commit()
    # Remove all existing children and create new, one of which is identical to a previously existing child
    p.children = [ChildEntity(z=5.5)](ChildEntity(z=4.0),)
    sess.commit()
Running this example produces the following error:
    sqlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError: (IntegrityError) columns parent_id, z are not unique u'INSERT INTO child (parent_id, z) VALUES (?, ?)' (1, 5.5)
