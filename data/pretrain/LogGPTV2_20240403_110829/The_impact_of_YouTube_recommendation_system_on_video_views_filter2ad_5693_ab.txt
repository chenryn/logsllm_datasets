# Impact of the Recommendation System on Video Views

## 1. Introduction
To understand which source is the dominant type for popular videos, we aggregated the videos using different view count ranges. Figure 7 shows the number of videos in each type for different view count ranges. From the figure, most popular videos are dominated by related video recommendations. Based on the results of both view count and view rate, we conclude that the category of Related Videos drives more views than other categories of view sources for the majority of videos.

## 2. How the Recommendation System Affects Video Views

In this section, we study how the recommendation system on YouTube affects the views of the videos. First, we look at the correlation between views and view rates between a video and its referrer videos. Then, we investigate how the positioning on the related video list affects the view propagation between the videos.

### 2.1 The Correlation Between Video Views and Referrer Video Views

As shown in Section 3.3, referrer videos are the dominant sources of views for the majority of videos. This suggests that there might be a strong correlation between the view or view rate of a video and its referrer videos. To verify this conjecture, we investigated the correlation of the view count of a video and the average view count of its top referrer videos. The top referrer videos of a video are a set of referrer videos that are the major view contributors to the video and are included in the top ten view sources list of the video. We further investigated the correlation of the view rate of a video and the average view rate of its top referred videos.

Figures 10 and 11 show the correlation between a video and its top referrer videos for view count and view rate, respectively, for the union set of D1 and D2. We observe the trend that the higher the average view count of the top referrer videos, the higher the view count of the video. The same trend can be observed for the view rate, but not as strong as that of the view count. This might be caused by the age difference of a video and its referrer videos.

We further investigate the correlation by computing the correlation coefficient of views and view rate between a video and its top referrer videos. The correlation coefficients are 0.60 and 0.44 for view count and view rate, respectively. The relatively high correlation coefficients provide additional evidence that the recommendation system has a significant impact on the views of videos. The implications from these results are that the group of referrer videos of a certain video is a good estimator and indicator for the view count of the video, and a video has a higher chance to become popular when it is placed on the related video lists of popular videos.

### 2.2 How the Position Affects Video Views

The related videos generated by the recommendation system are placed in order from the top to the bottom of the related video list shown on a video watch page. Understanding how the position of a video in the related video list affects the click-through rate (CTR) is important for understanding how videos drive views for their related videos.

We use the view statistics and data and the related video lists of referrer videos in D2 to investigate the CTR between related videos. For each pair (V, R) of a video V and its referrer video R, we determine the position of V on R’s related video list, the number of views that R contributed to V, and the number of views that R got after it contributed the first view to V. Then, we calculate the CTR for each pair (V, R), where V is in the Pth position of R’s related video list (1 ≤ P ≤ 20). Finally, we compute the median of CTRs for each position P.

The result is shown in Figure 12. The figure shows that the CTR declines steadily in a log-log plot as the position lowers, and it fits the Zipf function Y = βX^(-α) quite well. The sum of the CTRs from all positions is 41.6%, with the first position having a CTR of 5.9% and the last position 1.0%. This means when a user views a certain video, there is a 41.6% chance that she will watch one of the related videos. The difference between the CTRs of the first and the last position indicates that the position in a related video list plays an important role in video view propagation. However, the CTR for YouTube videos decreases at a slower rate than that of Google advertisements, which was reported that the first position attracted about 39 times more clicks than the 10th position [1]. This reflects the difference in the usage patterns of the recommendation system on the video sharing sites and the web advertisement.

## 3. Impact on Video View Diversity

In this section, we investigate the impact of the YouTube recommendation system on view diversity to understand whether the recommendation system helps users to discover videos of interest but not necessarily popular, or is more likely to recommend popular videos only.

To measure the view diversity, we use the Gini coefficient to measure the distributional inequality [5]. Ordering the videos ascendingly based on their number of views, the Gini coefficient for our case can be computed by:

\[ G = 1 - \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{n} (X_k - X_{k-1})(Y_k + Y_{k-1}) \]

where n is the number of total videos, \( X_k \) is the percentage of the first k videos, and \( Y_k \) is the percentage of the views from the first k videos.

We compare the Gini coefficients of two scenarios: where the recommendation system is presented and where it is not presented. For the first scenario, we simply use the tracked views to compute the Gini coefficients for datasets D1, D2, and the union set of D1 and D2. For the second scenario, where the recommendation system is not presented, we remove the views contributed by referrer videos from the tracked views, and then recalculate the Gini coefficients.

The Gini coefficients and the Lorenz curves for the two scenarios are shown in Table 4 and Figure 13, respectively. From the table, we find that the Gini coefficient for each scenario is quite high, which means the gap between the views of popular videos and niche videos is huge. This is confirmed by the Lorenz curve, which shows more than 90% of the views are from 20% of the videos. Furthermore, when we remove the views from the recommendation system, the Gini coefficient becomes even higher. This indicates that the existence of the recommendation system helps to decrease the Gini coefficient or, in other words, increase the view diversity.

| Dataset | Original Views | Related Removed |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| D1      | 0.90           | 0.87            |
| D2      | 0.90           | 0.88            |
| D1 & D2 | 0.90           | 0.87            |

## 4. Related Work

As one of the most popular and largest video-sharing websites, several studies have focused on the YouTube usage pattern and characteristics of videos on YouTube. In [7], Gill et al. study the traffic of YouTube from network edges, providing insight into YouTube utilization. They analyze the traces to investigate the characteristics of user sessions on YouTube. Zink et al. also perform an analysis of YouTube usage based on campus network traces in [12]. The relationship of related videos on YouTube has been studied by Cheng et al. in [4]. Their results show that the related video graph on YouTube exhibits small-world characteristics and has a large clustering coefficient.

In [3], Cha et al. study various aspects of video popularity and video views on YouTube. They propose using the history of video views to predict video popularity in the near future. Our work complements their work by showing that there is a correlation between a video's view count and its related videos' view count, and this should be another factor to consider in predicting video popularity.

Several previous works have studied the impact of recommendation systems on user behavior and the improvement of recommendation systems. In [5] and [6], Fleder and Hosanagar use analytical models and simulations to study the impact of the recommender on sales diversity. In [11], Zhou et al. propose recommendation systems that aim to achieve both diversity and accuracy.

The propagation of video views to its related videos is related to influence spreading in social networks. Leskovec et al. study the influence patterns in user-to-user recommendation networks in [8]. Zhao et al. present several mathematical models of influence spreading in [10].

## 5. Conclusion

In this paper, we performed a measurement study on the impact of the related video recommendation system on video views. Through the measurement of view sources, we found that the related video recommendation accounts for about 30% of overall views. Moreover, it is the most important view source for the majority of videos. By investigating how video views are driven by the recommendation system, we found a strong correlation between the view count of a video and the average view count of its top referrer videos, and also discovered that the position of a video on a related video list plays a critical role in the click-through rate of the video. Finally, the evaluation of the impact of the video recommendation system on the diversity of video views shows that the existence of the YouTube recommendation system helps to increase the diversity of video views in aggregation, which means that YouTube recommendation helps viewers discover more videos of their interest rather than just popular videos.
