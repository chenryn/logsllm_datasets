Based on the results of both view count and view rate,
we conclude that the category of Related Video drives more
views than other category of view sources for the majority

FECTS VIDEO VIEWS
In this section, we study how the recommendation system
on YouTube aﬀects the views of the videos. First, we look at
the correlation of views and view rates between a video and
its referrer videos. Then, we investigate how the positioning
on the related video list aﬀects the view propagation between
the videos.
4.1 The Correlation Between Video Views and
Referrer Video Views
As shown in Section 3.3, referrer videos are the dominant
sources of views for the majority of videos. This suggests
that there might be a strong correlation between the view
or view rate of a video and its referrer videos. To verify this
conjecture, we investigated the correlation of the view count
of a video and the average view count of its top referrer
videos. The top referrer videos of a video is a set of referrer
videos that are the major view contributors to the video and
are included in the top ten view sources list of the video. We
further investigated the correlation of view rate of a video
and the average video rate of its top referred videos.
In Figure 10 and Figure 11, we show the correlation be-
tween a video and its top referrer videos for view count and
view rate, respectively, for the union set of D1 and D2. We
observe the trend that the higher the average view count
of the top referrer videos, the higher the view count of the
video. The same trend can be observed for the view rate,
but not as strong as that of the view count. This might
be caused by the age diﬀerence of a video and its referrer
videos.

Figure 10: The view count of a video vs. the average
view count of its top referrer videos.
We further investigate the correlation by computing the
correlation coeﬃcient of views and view rate between a video
and its top referrer videos. The correlation coeﬃcients are
0.60 and 0.44 for view count and view rate, respectively.
The relatively high correlation coeﬃcients are the additional
evidence that the recommendation system has great impact
on the views of videos. The implications from these results
are that the group of referrer videos of a certain video is a
good estimator and indicator for the view count of the video,
and a video has a higher chance to become popular when it
is placed on the related video lists of popular videos.
4.2 How the Position Affects Video Views
The related videos generated by the recommendation sys-
tem are placed in order from the top to the bottom of the

view rate of its top referrer videos.
related video list shown on a video watch page. The un-
derstanding of how the position of a video in the related
video list aﬀects the click through rate (CTR) is important
for understanding how videos drive views for their related
videos.
We use the view statistics & data and the related video
lists of referrer videos in D2 to investigate the CTR between
related videos. For each pair (V, R) of a video V and its
referrer video R, we ﬁgure out the position of V on R’s
related video list, the number of views that R contributed to
V , and the number of views that R got after it contributed
the ﬁrst view to V . Then, we calculate the CTR for each
pair (V, R), where V is in the P th position of R’s related
video list (1 ≤ P ≤ 20). Finally, we compute the median of
CTRs for each position P .
The result is shown in Figure 12. The ﬁgure shows that
the CTR declines steadily in a log-log plot as the position
lowers, and it ﬁts the Zipf function Y = βX−α quite well.
The sum of the CTRs from all positions is 41.6%, with the
ﬁrst position having a CTR of 5.9% and the last position
1.0%. This means when a user views a certain video, there
is a 41.6% chance that she will watch one of the related
videos. The diﬀerence between the CTRs of the ﬁrst and the
last position indicates that the position in a related video list
plays an important role in video view propagation. However,
the CTR for YouTube videos decreases at a slower rate than
that of Google advertisement, which was reported that the
ﬁrst position attracted about 39 times more clicks than the
10th position [1]. This reﬂects the diﬀerence in the usage
patterns of the recommendation system on the video sharing
sites and the web advertisement.

IMPACT ON VIDEO VIEW DIVERSITY
In this section, we investigate the impact of YouTube
recommendation system on view diversity to understand
whether the recommendation system helps users to discover
videos of interest but not necessarily popular, or is more
likely to recommend popular videos only.
To measure the view diversity, we use the Gini coeﬃcient
to measure the distributional inequality [5]. Ordering the
videos ascendingly based on their number of views, the Gini
coeﬃcient for our case can be computed by
G = 1 − n(cid:2)
(Xk − Xk−1)(Yk + Yk−1),

where n is the number of total videos, Xk is the percentage
of the ﬁrst k videos, and Yk is the percentage of the views
from the ﬁrst k videos.
We compare the Gini coeﬃcients of two scenarios: where
the recommendation system is presented and where it is
not presented. For the ﬁrst scenario, we simply use the
tracked views to compute the Gini coeﬁcients for data set
D1, D2, and the union set of D1 and D2. For the second sce-
nario, where the recommendation system is not presented,
we remove the views contributed by referrer videos from the
tracked views, and then recalculate the Gini coeﬃcients.
The Gini coeﬃcients and the Lorenz curves for the two
scenarios are shown in Table 4 and Figure 13, respectively.
From the table, we ﬁnd that the Gini coeﬃcient for each
scenario is quite high, which means the gap between the
views of popular videos and niche videos is huge. This is
conﬁrmed by the Lorenz curve, which shows more than 90%
of the views are from 20% of the videos. Furthermore, when
we remove the views from the recommendation system, the
Gini coeﬃcient becomes even higher. This indicates that the
existence of the recommendation system helps to decrease
the Gini coeﬃcient or, in other words, increase the view
diversity.

6. RELATED WORK
As one of the most popular and largest video sharing web-
sites, there are several studies on the YouTube usage pattern
and characteristics of videos on YouTube. In [7], Gill et al.
study the traﬃc of YouTube from network edges, provid-
ing the insight on YouTube utilization. They analyze the
traces to investigate the characteristics of user session on
YouTube. Zink et al. also perform the analysis on YouTube
usage based on the campus network traces in [12]. The re-
lationship of related videos on YouTube has been studied
by Cheng et al in [4]. Their result shows that the related
video graph on YouTube exhibits small-world characteris-
tics and has a large clustering coeﬃcient.
In [3], Cha et
al. study various aspects about video popularity and video
view on YouTube. They propose to use the history of video
view to predict video popularity in near future. Our work
compliments their work by showing that there is a corre-
lation between a video’s view count and its related videos’
view count, and this should be another factor to consider in
predicting video popularity.
Several previous works study the impact of recommen-
dation system on the user behavior and the improvement
for the recommendation system. In [5] and [6], Fleder and
Hosanagar use analytical model and simulation to study the
impact of the recommender on sales diversity. In [11], Zhou
et al. propose the recommendation systems that aim to
achieve both diversity and accuracy.
The propagation of video views to its related videos is re-
lated to inﬂuence spreading in social networks. Leskovec et
al. study the inﬂuence patterns in user-to-user recommenda-
tion network in [8]. Zhao et al. present several mathematical
models of inﬂuence spreading in [10].
7. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we perform a measurement study on the
impact of related video recommendation system on video
views. Through the measurement of view sources, we ﬁnd
that the related video recommendation accounts for about
30% of overall views. Moreover, it is the most important
view source for the majority of videos. By investigating how
video views are driven by the recommendation system, we
ﬁnd a strong correlation between the view count of a video
and the average view count of its top referrer videos, and
also discover that the position of a video on a related video
list plays a critical role in the click through rate of the video.
Finally, the evaluation of the impact of the video recommen-
dation system on the diversity of video views shows that
the existence of YouTube recommendation helps to increase
the diversity of video views in aggregation, which means
that YouTube recommendation helps viewers discover more
videos of their interest rather than the popular videos only.
