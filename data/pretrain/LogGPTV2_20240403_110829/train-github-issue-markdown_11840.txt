## Expected Behavior
When consuming packages with both transpiled and untranspiled modules, as
defined in their `package.json` with `main:` pointing to the transpiled
version and `module:` pointing to the untranspiled one, Next5 picks up the
`module:` entry. I'm expecting Next to pick the `main` entry.
## Current Behavior
Next5 picks up the `module:` entry.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Install a package that has both `main:` and `module:` defined in a `package.json`. For example:
    main: 'dist/index.js'
    module: `src/index.js`
  2. Check that Next.js picks up `src/index.js` instead of `dist/index.js`
