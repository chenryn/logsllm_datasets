### Issue Description
I am currently working behind a corporate firewall and have configured my `.npmrc` file with both `proxy` and `https-proxy` settings. However, it seems that `next@6.0.0` is attempting to connect to npm during startup and is ignoring the proxy settings in my `.npmrc` file. This results in what appears to be proxy-related issues when I start my Next.js application in development mode.

### Expected Behavior
Running `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` should successfully start the development server.

### Current Behavior
When I run `yarn dev`, I encounter the following error:

```sh
Î» yarn dev
yarn run v1.3.2
$ next
{ Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 151.101.0.162:443
    at Object._errnoException (util.js:1024:11)
    at _exceptionWithHostPort (util.js:1046:20)
    at TCPConnectWrap.afterConnect [as oncomplete] (net.js:1182:14)
  code: 'ECONNREFUSED',
  errno: 'ECONNREFUSED',
  syscall: 'connect',

  port: 443 }
error Command failed with exit code 1.

```

This issue does not occur when using `yarn build` and `yarn start`.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Ensure you are behind a corporate firewall and have a custom `.npmrc` file with proxy settings.
2. Clone the example project: [Next.js Hello World Example](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples/hello-world).
3. Run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the connection error.

### Context
This issue has only appeared after upgrading to `next@6.0.0`. It might be related to the `update-check` feature introduced in this version.

### Environment
- **Next.js Version:** 6.0.0
- **Node.js Version:** 8.9.1
- **Operating System:** Windows 7 x64

### Additional Notes
- The problem does not occur if there is no proxy involved.
- The issue is consistent across multiple projects, but the provided example is a good starting point for reproduction.
