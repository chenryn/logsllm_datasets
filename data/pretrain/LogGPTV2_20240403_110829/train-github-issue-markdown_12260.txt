I'm behind a corporate firewall and have to have a .npmrc setup with a proxy
and https-proxy.
There appears to be something in next@6.0.0 that tries to connect to npm on
launch and seems to ignore my .npmrc proxy settings as I'm seeing what look
like proxy problems when I start my next app in dev mode.
## Expected Behavior
running `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` should bring up the server.
## Current Behavior
    Î» yarn dev
    yarn run v1.3.2
    $ next
    { Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 151.101.0.162:443
        at Object._errnoException (util.js:1024:11)
        at _exceptionWithHostPort (util.js:1046:20)
        at TCPConnectWrap.afterConnect [as oncomplete] (net.js:1182:14)
      code: 'ECONNREFUSED',
      errno: 'ECONNREFUSED',
      syscall: 'connect',
      address: '151.101.0.162',
      port: 443 }
    error Command failed with exit code 1.

n.b. this does not occur when using `yarn build` & `yarn start`.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
This appears to affect all projects, but I used this one:

You need to be relying on a custom .npmrc with a proxy - everything is fine if
you don't have a proxy.
## Context
This has only broken since upgrading to next@6.0.0 - maybe related to `update-
check`?
