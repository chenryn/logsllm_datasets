Abstract
Modern aircraft heavily rely on several wireless technolo-
gies for communications, control, and navigation. Researchers
demonstrated vulnerabilities in many aviation systems. How-
ever, the resilience of the aircraft landing systems to adver-
sarial wireless attacks have not yet been studied in the open
literature, despite their criticality and the increasing availabil-
ity of low-cost software-deﬁned radio (SDR) platforms. In
this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of aircraft instru-
ment landing systems (ILS) to wireless attacks. We show the
feasibility of spooﬁng ILS radio signals using commercially-
available SDR, causing last-minute go around decisions, and
even missing the landing zone in low-visibility scenarios. We
demonstrate on aviation-grade ILS receivers that it is pos-
sible to fully and in ﬁne-grain control the course deviation
indicator as displayed by the ILS receiver, in real-time. We
analyze the potential of both an overshadowing attack and
a lower-power single-tone attack. In order to evaluate the
complete attack, we develop a tightly-controlled closed-loop
ILS spoofer that adjusts the adversary’s transmitted signals
as a function of the aircraft GPS location, maintaining power
and deviation consistent with the adversary’s target position,
causing an undetected off-runway landing. We systematically
evaluate the performance of the attack against an FAA cer-
tiﬁed ﬂight-simulator (X-Plane)’s AI-based autoland feature
and demonstrate systematic success rate with offset touch-
downs of 18 meters to over 50 meters.
1 Introduction
Today, the aviation industry is experiencing signiﬁcant growth
in air trafﬁc with more than 5000 ﬂights [14] in the sky at any
given time. It has become typical for air trafﬁc control towers
to handle more than a thousand takeoffs and landings every
day. For example, Atlanta’s Hartsﬁeld-Jackson International
airport handles around 2500 takeoffs and landings every day.
Boston’s Logan airport which is not one of the busiest air-
ports in the world managed an average of 1100 ﬂights every
day in August 2018. The modern aviation ecosystem heavily
relies on a plethora of wireless technologies for their safe
and efﬁcient operation. For instance, air trafﬁc controllers
verbally communicate with the pilots over the VHF (30 to
300 MHz) radio frequency channels. The airplanes continu-
ously broadcast their position, velocity, callsigns, altitude, etc.
using the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-
B) wireless communication protocol. Primary and secondary
surveillance radars enable aircraft localization and provide
relevant target information to the air trafﬁc controllers. Trafﬁc
Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), an airborne
wireless system independent of the air trafﬁc controller en-
ables the aircraft to detect potential collisions and alert the
pilots. Air trafﬁc information, ﬂight information and other
operational control messages between the aircraft and ground
stations are transferred using the Aircraft Communications
Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) which uses the
VHF and HF radio frequency channels for communication.
Similarly, many radio navigation aids such as GPS, VHF
Omnidirectional Radio Range (VOR), Non-directional radio
beacons (NDB), Distance Measuring Equipment (DME), and
Instrument Landing System (ILS) play crucial roles during
different phases of an airplane’s ﬂight.
Many studies have already demonstrated that a number
of the above-mentioned aviation systems are vulnerable to
attacks. For example, researchers [22] injected non-existing
aircraft in the sky by merely spooﬁng ADS-B messages. Some
other attacks [37] modiﬁed the route of an airplane by jam-
ming and replacing the ADS-B signals of speciﬁc victim
aircraft. ACARS, the data link communications system be-
tween aircraft and ground stations was found to leak a signiﬁ-
cant amount of private data [50], e.g., passenger information,
medical data and sometimes even credit card details were
transferred. GPS, one of the essential navigation aids is also
vulnerable to signal spooﬁng attacks [32]. Furthermore, an
attacker can spoof TCAS messages [42] creating false reso-
lution advisories and forcing the pilot to initiate avoidance
maneuvers. Given the dependence on wireless technologies,
the threats described above are real and shows the impor-
tance of building secure aviation control, communication and
navigation systems.

One of the most critical phases of an airplane’s ﬂight plan
is the ﬁnal approach or landing phase as the plane descends
towards the ground actively maneuvered by the pilot. For ex-
ample, 59% of the fatal accidents documented by Boeing [16]
occurred during descent, approach and landing. Several tech-
nologies and systems such as GPS, VOR, DME assist the pilot
in landing the aircraft safely. The Instrument Landing Sys-
tem (ILS) [17] is today the de-facto approach system used by
planes at a majority of the airports as it is the most precise sys-
tem capable of providing accurate horizontal and vertical guid-
ance. At Boston’s Logan International Airport, 405,822 [1]
ﬂight plans were ﬁled in 2017. Out of these 405,822 ﬂight
plans, 95% were instrument ﬂight rule (IFR) plans. Instrument
ﬂight rules are a set of instructions established by the FAA
to govern ﬂight under conditions in which ﬂying by visual
reference is either unsafe or just not allowed. Also, several
European airports [9] prohibit aircraft from landing using
visual ﬂight rules during the night. ILS incorporates radio
technology to provide all-weather guidance to pilots which
ensures safe travel and any interference can be catastrophic.
As recently as September 2018, the pilots of Air India ﬂight
AI-101 reported an instrument landing system (ILS) malfunc-
tion and were forced to do an emergency landing. Even worse,
TCAS, ACARS, and a majority of other systems that aid a
smooth landing were unusable. Furthermore, NASA’s Avi-
ation Safety Reporting System [25] indicate over 300 ILS
related incidents where pilots reported the erratic behavior
of the localizer and glideslope–two critical components of
ILS. ILS also plays a signiﬁcant role in autoland systems
that are capable of landing aircraft even in the most adverse
conditions without manual interference. Autoland systems
have signiﬁcantly advanced over the years since its ﬁrst de-
ployment in De Havilland’s DH121 Trident, the ﬁrst airliner
to be ﬁtted with an autoland system [15]. However, several
near-catastrophic events [4, 8, 12] have been reported due to
the failure or erratic behavior of these autoland systems with
ILS interference as one of the principal causes. With increas-
ing reliance on auto-pilot systems and widespread availability
of low-cost software-deﬁned radio hardware platforms, adver-
sarial wireless interference to critical infrastructure systems
such as the ILS cannot be ruled out.
In this work, we investigate the security of aircraft instru-
ment landing system against wireless attacks. To the best of
our knowledge, there has been no prior study on the security
guarantees of the instrument landing system. Speciﬁcally, our
contributions are as follows.
• We analyze the ILS localizer and glideslope waveforms,
the transmitters and receivers, and show that ILS is vul-
nerable to signal spooﬁng attacks. We devise two types
of wireless attacks i) overshadow, and ii) single-tone
attacks.
• For both the attacks, we generate specially crafted ra-
dio signals similar to the legitimate ILS signals using
Figure 1: Overview of ILS sub-systems. The ILS consists of three
subsystems: i) Localizer, ii) glideslope, and (iii) marker beacons.
low-cost software-deﬁned radio hardware platform and
successfully induce aviation-grade ILS receivers, in real-
time, to lock and display arbitrary alignment to both hori-
zontal and vertical approach path. This demonstrates the
potential for an adversary to the least be able to trigger
multiple aborted landings causing air trafﬁc disruption,
and in the worst case, cause the aircraft to overshoot the
landing zone or miss the runway entirely.
• In order to evaluate the complete attack, we develop a
tightly-controlled closed-loop ILS spoofer. It adjusts the
the adversary’s transmitted signals as a function of the
aircraft GPS location, maintaining power and deviation
consistent with the adversary’s target position, causing
an undetected off-runway landing. We demonstrate the
integrated attack on an FAA certiﬁed ﬂight-simulator (X-
Plane), incorporating a spooﬁng region detection mech-
anism, that triggers the controlled spooﬁng on entering
the landing zone to reduce detectability.
• We systematically evaluate the performance of the attack
against X-Plane’s AI-based autoland feature, and demon-
strate the systematic success rate with offset touchdowns
of 18 meters to over 50 meters.
• We discuss potential countermeasures including failsafe
systems such as GPS and show that these systems also do
not provide sufﬁcient security guarantees. We highlight
that implementing cryptographic authentication on ILS
signals is not enough as the the system would still be vul-
nerable to record and replay attacks. Therefore, through
this research, we highlight an open research challenge
of building secure, scalable and efﬁcient aircraft landing
systems.

2 Background
Approach systems enable pilots to land airplanes even in ex-
treme weather conditions and are classiﬁed into non-precision
and precision approach systems based on the accuracy and
type of approach guidance provided to an aircraft. Non-
precision approach systems provide only horizontal or lateral
guidance (heading/bearing). Examples of non-precision ap-
proach systems are VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) [58],
Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) [57], and satellite systems
such as GPS. With the development of precision approach
systems, the use of non-precision approach systems such as
VOR and NDB has signiﬁcantly decreased today. Precision
approach systems provide both horizontal (heading/bearing)
as well as vertical (glide path) guidance to an approaching
aircraft. The Instrument Landing System (ILS) is the most
commonly deployed precision approach system in use to-
day. Other examples of precision approach systems include
Microwave Landing System (MLS), Transponder Landing
System (TLS), Ground Based Augmentation Landing System
(GLS), and Joint Precision Approach and Landing System
(JPALS). It is important to note that these alternate landing
systems fundamentally still use existing ILS concepts and
equipment mostly in scenarios where ILS is unavailable. For
example, TLS enables precision landing guidance in places
where the terrain is uneven, and the ILS signal reﬂections off
the ground cause undesirable needle deﬂections by emulating
the ILS signals using only one base tower (in contrast to two
for ILS) whose placement allows more ﬂexibility. However,
TLS still leverages the same fundamental concepts of ILS. In
short, ILS plays a key, de-facto role in providing precision
landing guidance at the majority of airports today and it is,
therefore, essential to evaluate its resilience to modern-day
cyber-physical attacks.
Instrument Landing System (ILS)
2.1
The ﬁrst fully operational ILS was deployed in 1932 at the
Berlin Tempelhof Central Airport, Germany. ILS enables the
pilot to align the aircraft with the centerline of the runway
and maintain a safe descent rate. ITU deﬁnes ILS [28] as “a
radio navigation system which provides aircraft with hori-
zontal and vertical guidance just before and during landing
and at certain ﬁxed points, indicates the distance to the refer-
ence point of landing”. Autopilot systems on some modern
aircraft [49] use ILS signals to execute a fully autonomous
approach and landing, especially in low visibility settings.
ILS (Figure 1) comprises of three independent subsystems:
i) localizer, (ii) glideslope and iii) marker beacons. The lo-
calizer and the glideslope guide the aircraft in the horizontal
and vertical plane respectively. The marker beacons act as
checkpoints that enable the pilot to determine the aircraft’s
distance to the runway. ILS has three operational categories:
i) CAT I, ii) CAT II and, iii) CAT III. CAT III further has three
sub-standards IIIa, IIIb and, IIIc. These operational categories
are decided based on ILS installations at the airport 1 and is
independent of the receiver on the aircraft. With the advent of
GPS and other localization technologies, the marker beacons
are less important today and increasingly obsolete. However,
the localizer and the glideslope play a major role in an air-
craft’s safe landing today and is expected to remain so for
many years.

ILS signal generators leverage space modulation
i.e., use multiple antennas to transmit an amplitude modulated
radio frequency signals with various powers and phases. The
transmitted signals combine in the airspace to form signals
with different depths of modulation (DDM) at various points
within the 3D airspace. Each DDM value directly indicates a
speciﬁc deviation of the aircraft from the correct touchdown
position. For example, the signals combine in space to pro-
duce a signal with zero difference in the depth of modulation
(DDM) along the center-line of the runway. It is important to
note that unlike traditional modulation techniques where the
modulation occurs within the modulating hardware, in space
modulation, the signals mix within the airspace.
The process of generating the localizer and glideslope sig-
nals ( Figure 2 ) are similar with differences mainly in the
carrier frequency used and how they are combined in space
to provide the relevant guidance information. The carrier sig-
nal is amplitude modulated with 90 Hz and 150 Hz tones
to a certain depth of modulation. The depth of modulation
or modulation index is the measure of the extent of ampli-
