# Bug Report

## Current Behavior
When using `webpack`, `webpack-dev-middleware`, and `webpack-hot-server-middleware` for Node.js Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Webpack V5, hot updates are failing and reporting errors.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Set up a project with the following dependencies:
   - `"webpack": "^5.74.0"`
   - `"webpack-cli": "^4.10.0"`
   - `"webpack-dev-middleware": "3.7.3"`
   - `"webpack-hot-server-middleware": "^0.6.1"`
2. Use Node.js version 16.
3. Run the project on macOS or Windows.
4. Enable hot updates and observe the error messages.

### Error Messages
```

```

### Expected Behavior
Hot updates should work without errors, and the middleware should be compatible with Webpack V5.

### Other Relevant Information
- **Webpack Version:** `^5.74.0`
- **Webpack CLI Version:** `^4.10.0`
- **Webpack Dev Middleware Version:** `3.7.3`
- **Webpack Hot Server Middleware Version:** `^0.6.1`
- **Node.js Version:** 16
- **Operating System:** macOS, Windows
- **Additional Tools:** Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

### Additional Notes
- I suspect that `webpack-hot-server-middleware` is not fully compatible with Webpack V5. It would be helpful if this middleware could be updated to support Webpack V5.
- Additionally, when using Webpack V5, `webpack-dev-middleware` does not upgrade to the highest V5 version, leading to issues such as `res.getHeader` being undefined.
