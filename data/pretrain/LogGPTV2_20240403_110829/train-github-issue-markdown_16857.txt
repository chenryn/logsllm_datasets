**Other relevant information:**  
webpack version:  
"webpack": "^5.74.0",  
"webpack-cli": "^4.10.0",  
"webpack-dev-middleware": "3.7.3",  
"webpack-hot-server-middleware": "^0.6.1",  
Node.js version: 16  
Operating System: mac windows  
Additional tools: vscode  
I was using webpack webpack-dev-middleware Webpack-hot-server-middleware for
Node SSR Webpack-hot-server-middleware Hot updates will report errors in
Webpack V5.  
error message:

I think Webpack-hot-Server-middleware is not compatible with Webpack V5. I
hope you can upgrade Webpack-hot-Server-middleware。
Also, when I use WebPack V5, Webpack-dev-middleware is not upgraded to the
highest V5 version, otherwise, res.getHeader is undefined。
