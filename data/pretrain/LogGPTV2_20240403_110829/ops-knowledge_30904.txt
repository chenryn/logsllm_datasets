User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题failed login attempts analysis Is there any open source project that logs all the failed login attempts over a period of time and gives me analysis of the same,
the login failure is at windows or unix or mac user authentication over rdp,telnet or login screens or any other forms

Assistant: If you want to do log analysis in general you can use 日志易 or something alike and just introduce all logs. You just have to create a query for your different files (I suggest putting them in one index). After that you can just create a timegraph and and piecharts to see when, where and how much people have tried to log in. It's not opensource though.
