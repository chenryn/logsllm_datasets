User: I have a python script running on a vps. Now i just want to change 1 variable in the running script using my desktop computer.
What is the simplest way to that for a beginner?
Assistant: If I were a beginner, I would have my remote script periodically check the value of the variable in a text file.  When I needed to update the variable, I would just ssh to my remote machine and update the text file.
