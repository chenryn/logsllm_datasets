### Traffic Filtering Technology and Censorship
Sophisticated censors may gain access to more granular controls, enabling them to implement censorship with greater precision.

### Challenges in Measuring Censorship
With an understanding of how common censorship is implemented, researchers must tailor their measurements to detect most, if not all, known implementations. Numerous studies have focused on specific countries, such as India [89], Thailand [27], China [12, 31, 33, 88, 93], Iran [4], Pakistan [39, 50], and Syria [10]. Recent work has discussed the political history of Russia's blocking of Telegram [45], but our study provides the first in-depth analysis of Russia's Internet censorship techniques.

#### Components of Effective Censorship Measurement
1. **Input List**: The list of domains or IP addresses being tested can significantly impact the results and effectiveness of a study [56]. Citizen Lab maintains both general lists of frequently censored sites worldwide and country-specific lists [40]. Hounsel et al. [33] discuss the automatic curation of culture-specific input lists by analyzing web pages censored in China, noting that the lack of an authoritative blocklist complicates the determination of censor intent and the identification of censored sites.
2. **Category Identification**: Meaningful conclusions about global censorship and comparisons between countries are only possible at a category level. However, identifying the category of a given website is non-trivial. Current state-of-the-art methods, such as Fortiguard [25], often struggle with non-English websites.
3. **Ground Truth and Control Vantage Points**: Censorship measurement studies often lack ground truth for validating findings. To address this, studies need to establish strong controls from multiple geographically distributed vantage points. These vantage points should be in networks unaffected by the censorship regime under study, ensuring that the controls are free from transient measurement artifacts and noise.

#### Diverse Vantage Points
To comprehensively study the extent of censorship in a particular region, a set of diverse vantage points is necessary to provide a localized view of the network. Direct measurements involve using data from users or vantage points (machines controlled by the researcher) inside the country of interest [55]. For example, Winter and Lindskog [84] used one vantage point to study Tor reachability in China, and Aryan et al. [4] used one vantage point in their study of Iranian censorship. While one or a few vantage points may suffice for centralized censorship regimes, decentralized regimes require a diversity of perspectives.

#### Remote Censorship Measurement Tools
In recent years, remote censorship measurement tools have gained popularity due to their ability to use more vantage points and perform ethical measurements [21, 57, 58, 70, 78]. These tools do not directly control the vantage points they use for measurement, making them less suitable for in-depth investigatory testing but effective for global censorship measurement. Data from remote measurements complements direct measurements, offering different visibility into the network and providing a more complete view of censorship practices.

#### Continuous Censorship Measurement Platforms
Recent efforts have focused on developing platforms for continuous collection of censorship measurement data. Successful examples include the Tor projectâ€™s Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI) [55], which performs ongoing censorship measurements from volunteer participants' vantage points [24], and Censored Planet [9], which conducts continuous remote measurements to identify the prevalence of various censorship techniques in real-time, leveraging the techniques discussed in [57, 58, 70, 78].

### Ethical Considerations in Censorship Studies
It is crucial to consider the ethical implications of censorship studies to safeguard participants, whether they are direct volunteers or remote vantage points. Volunteers, especially those in non-democratic regimes, face risks when accessing sensitive websites. In Section IV, we provide comprehensive guidelines followed in this study to benefit other researchers conducting similar work.

### Russian Information Control
Russia's censorship regime is a compelling example of decentralized control, worthy of study. Over the past decade, Russia's censorship activities have increased, with recent events highlighting its information controls. For instance, Russia's 2017 decision to block all Telegram traffic resulted in significant collateral damage, affecting other services hosted on Google and Amazon [82].

#### Russian Legal and Technical Framework
- **Legal Framework**: The primary entity responsible for nationwide Russian Internet censorship is Roskomnadzor (Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology, and Mass Media) [66]. Other government bodies may request that Roskomnadzor block sites, often related to their scope of duty. The full set of illegal subjects is documented in multiple federal laws [64]. Roskomnadzor maintains a centralized Internet blocklist, officially called the Registry of Banned Sites, which is an implementation of federal law 139-FZ passed on July 28, 2012. The blocklist is publicly accessible, though only through singular queries via a CAPTCHA-protected web interface [64].
- **Technical Framework**: Although Roskomnadzor maintains the central registry, it does not handle the technical implementation of censorship. Upon identifying a website with illegal content, Roskomnadzor sends notice to the website owner and hosting provider. If the illegal content is not removed within three days, the site is added to the registry, and all ISPs across Russia are required to block access. Complying content owners can reinstate access once the violating content is removed [15]. The specific method of blocking is not specified, allowing ISPs to implement different mechanisms. Non-compliant ISPs may incur fines [72]. Additionally, Russia has developed deep packet inspection technology called SORM, primarily used for surveillance but also for traffic filtering by some ISPs [62, 79].

#### Leaked Blocklist
While the blocklist used in Russia is not fully public, we obtained a link to a repository with regular updates dating back seven years, as well as official copies of the "current" blocklist signed by Roskomnadzor through our collaboration with activists within Russia. This is the first in-depth study of censorship based on an authoritative blocklist intended for censorship.

### Experiment Design
Our experiments to measure Internet censorship in Russia must consider:
1. **What to Test**: An input list of sensitive content likely to be blocked by Russian censors.
2. **Where to Test**: A set of vantage points from which to test reachability to websites in the input list.
3. **How to Test**: Methods to infer details about censorship implementation.

#### Acquiring the Russian Blocklist (RUBL)
We worked with activists in Russia to identify websites of concern, leading to the discovery of a leaked blocklist repository [63] with over 26,000 commits dating back to November 2012. This GitHub repository, Zapret, is well-known in the "Digital Rights guardians" community and is rumored to represent frequent snapshots of daily blocklists received by ISPs. We also obtained five digitally signed samples of the blocklist distributed by Roskomnadzor, verifying their authenticity. We used the blocklist dated April 24, 2019, referred to as RUBL, for our measurements. RUBL contains unique IPs, domains, and subnets, which we validated and categorized further.

#### Establishing Sound Control Measurements
Before running measurements from Russia, we conducted control tests to remove unresponsive IP addresses and domains. We used 13 geographically diverse control vantage points outside of Russia: 4 in North America, 4 in Asia, 4 in Europe, and 1 in Australia. We verified responsive domains using ZGrab [92] and ZDNS [90], resulting in a list of 98,098 domains (RUBLdom). We also tested the responsiveness of IPs and subnets using ZMap, resulting in 121,025 IP addresses (RUBLip) and 31 subnets (RUBLsub).

#### Conducting Direct Measurement
1. **Vantage Points**:
   - **VPSes in Data Centers**: With help from activists, we obtained six reliable VPSes in different Russian ISPs. Renting these machines requires Russian currency and an in-country phone number and address.
   - **Residential Probes**: We recruited 14 participants within Russia to run probe code from residential networks, covering 13 ISPs. Our direct measurement platform consists of 20 vantage points, with remote measurements from over 1,000 vantage points. Our vantage points cover 408 unique ASes, controlling approximately 65% of Russian IP address space [17].

2. **Identifying Censorship Methods**: With an established measurement platform and the RUBLdom, RUBLip, and RUBLsub, we can now proceed to identify and analyze the specific methods of censorship used in Russia.
