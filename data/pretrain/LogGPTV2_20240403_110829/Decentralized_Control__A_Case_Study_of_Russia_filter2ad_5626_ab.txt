trafﬁc ﬁltering technology, sophisticated censors may obtain
access to more ﬁne-grained controls to effect censorship.
2) Censorship Measurement Challenges: With the knowl-
edge of how common censorship is implemented, researchers
need to tailor measurements to detect most if not all known
implementations. There have been numerous other censorship
studies that focus on a speciﬁc country. Examples of these
studies include India [89], Thailand [27], China [12], [31], [33],
[88], [93], Iran [4], Pakistan [39], [50], and Syria [10]. While
recent work has discussed the political history of Russian’s
blocking of Telegram [45], our work presents the ﬁrst in-depth
study of Russia’s Internet censorship techniques.
Effectively measuring censorship requires several compo-
nents. First and foremost, the “input list” of domains or IP
addresses being tested can dramatically impact results and
effectiveness of any study [56]. Citizen Lab maintains several
test lists [40], both general lists of sites that are frequently
censored world-wide as well as country-speciﬁc lists. Hounsel
et al. discusses automatically curating a culture-speciﬁc input
list by analyzing web pages that are censored in China [33],
noting that a lack of an authoritative blocklist can make it
difﬁcult to ascertain the intent of the censor and therefore
obscure not only why certain sites are censored but also whether
measurements of those sites indicate censorship. Further,
drawing meaningful conclusions about global censorship and
comparing countries is only possible at a category level. But
identifying the category of a given website is not a trivial
problem. The current state of the art is to use services like
3
Fortiguard [25] but these services often do not work well for
websites other than English.
Censorship measurement studies often suffer from the lack
of ground truth which is generally used to validate ﬁndings. To
compensate for this, studies need to establish strong controls
from multiple geographically distributed control vantage points.
These vantage points need to be in networks that are not
inﬂuenced by the censorship regime being studied, and by
using multiple vantage points we ensure that the controls are
free of effects of transient measurement artifacts and noise.
These “control measurements” are necessary to establish a
baseline for the rest of the study.
In order to comprehensively study the extent of censorship
in a particular region, we need a set of “diverse vantage points”
that shed light on a localized view of the network it operates in.
The most direct form of measuring Internet censorship involves
using data from users or vantage points (machines under the
control of the researcher) inside the country of interest [55].
For example, Winter and Lindskog [84] used one vantage point
to study Tor reachability in China and Aryan et al. [4] used
one vantage point in their study of Iranian censorship. While
one or a few vantage points may be sufﬁcient for measuring
centralized censorship regimes, decentralized regimes require
a diversity of perspectives.
By making requests to sensitive domains or IP addresses,
researchers can directly observe responses from censors and
this has been useful for in-depth investigation of censorship
techniques in speciﬁc countries. These techniques—which
we refer to as “direct measurements”—are limited in scale,
robustness, and reliability. This is in part due to the difﬁculty in
obtaining vantage points and volunteers and further, due to the
potential “ethical burdens” of connecting to known-censored
content on infrastructure that is likely owned by citizens subject
to the jurisdiction of the censor being studied.
In recent years, the popularity of remote censorship mea-
surement tools have grown because of their capability to use
more vantage points and perform ethical measurements [21],
[57], [58], [70], [78]. These tools do not directly control
the vantage points they use for measurement, and thus are
not useful for in-depth investigatory testing, but perform
well for global censorship measurement. Data collected from
remote measurement is also highly complementary to direct
measurement since they use different techniques and offer
different visibility into the network. Together they are able to
offer a more complete view of censorship practices.
Due to observed temporal and spatial variability, recent
efforts have focused on developing platforms to continuously
collect measurement data on global censorship. One success-
ful platform is Tor project’s Open Observatory of Network
Interference (OONI) [55], which performs an ongoing set of
censorship measurements from the vantage points of volunteer
participants [24]. Censored Planet [9], another global censorship
observatory, performs continuous remote measurements to
identify the prevalence of a variety of censorship techniques
in real-time, leveraging the techniques discussed in [57], [58],
[70], [78].
3) Censorship Measurement Ethical Considerations: It is
important to be aware of the ethical considerations censorship
studies take to safeguard participants, regardless of whether
they have directly participated (e.g. volunteers) or used as
remote vantage points (e.g. organizational servers). Volunteers,
especially those in less than democratic regimes, face a risk
in accessing sensitive websites. In Section IV we provide
comprehensive guidelines that we followed for this study in the
hope that it beneﬁts other researchers interested in performing
similar work.
B. Russian Information Control
So far we have established common mechanisms by which
censorship can occur, and challenges in the way of detecting
censorship. In this section, we turn our attention to why
Russia’s censorship regime is such a compelling example of
decentralized control, worthy of study. Russia’s censorship
regime has seen increased activity in the past decade, but
recent events have thrust Russia’s information controls into the
spotlight. In a famous example, Russia’s decision in 2017 to
block all Telegram trafﬁc had a massive impact on Internet
reachability, as the ﬁrst attempt to censor Telegram simply
blocked millions of IP addresses belonging to the CDNs that
Telegram was hosted on [45]. The blocking of these IPs resulted
in signiﬁcant collateral damage, with other services hosted on
Google and Amazon becoming unreachable [82].
In order to gain insight into the capability of the Russian
government to restrict access to content on the Internet within
its borders, we began collaborating with activists within Russia.
This collaboration was necessary as Russia has a complex
regime of government institutions, each of which control one
or a few speciﬁc topics that ultimately cause sites to be censored.
Our interest stems from the fact that the Russian censorship
model can be easily adopted by another country with a similar
network structure. In fact, as we discuss in Section VII, other
countries such as the United Kingdom already have a censorship
regime similar to Russia’s (albeit less aggressive). Therefore,
we hope that the lessons learned from Russia can help hone
future censorship research and meet international regulatory
needs to ensure global Internet connectivity.
The rest of this section discusses the speciﬁc regulatory and
historical characteristics that created Russia’s censorship regime.
This information helped us shape our research questions, which
we present in the following section.
Russian Legal Framework:
The primary entity in charge of
nationwide Russian Internet censorship is called Roskomnadzor
(Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Infor-
mation Technology, and Mass Media) [66]. Other government
bodies may request that Roskomnadzor block sites, often with
content directly related to their scope of duty. The full set of
illegal subjects are thoroughly documented by a number of
normative acts spanning multiple signed federal laws [64].
Roskomnadzor maintains a singular and centralized Internet
blocklist,1 ofﬁcially called the Registry of Banned Sites. This
registry is an implementation of federal law 139-FZ, passed on
July 28, 2012. Currently, Roskomnadzor’s registry of banned
sites is available to the public, although not in its entirety—only
singular queries of an IP address or domain are supported, via
1However, there is anecdotal evidence that ISPs sometimes receive slightly
different versions and at least one account of Crimea having its own blocklist
altogether [76].

a web interface protected with a CAPTCHA [64]. Since its
creation, the blocklist has grown in size as new laws were
passed to enable the censorship of many subject matters.
Russian Technical Framework:
Although Roskomnadzor
maintains the central registry of banned sites, they are not
behind the technical implementation of censorship in Russia
(though they do provide guidelines [67]). Upon the identiﬁcation
of a website with illegal content, Roskomnadzor sends notice
to the website’s owner and hosting provider. If the illegal
content is not removed within three days, the corresponding
site is added to Roskomnadzor’s registry, and all ISPs across
Russia are required to block access to websites in this registry.
Therefore, the implementation of censorship falls on Russian
ISPs. Complying content owners are able to reinstate access to
their websites once violating content has been removed [15].
Notably, the speciﬁc method of blocking is not speciﬁed, which
enables ISPs to implement different censorship mechanisms.
ISPs that do not comply with censorship orders sometimes
incur ﬁnes [72].
While the Russian government itself does not directly censor
trafﬁc, it has promulgated some mechanisms for enabling
its ISPs to censor trafﬁc. Russia has developed deep packet
inspection technology called SORM (System of Operative
Search Measures) [62] that it requires ISPs operate in their
data centers. The interception boxes themselves are constructed
by a variety of commodity manufacturers [62], [79]. While
SORM is primarily used for surveillance purposes [73], [74],
some ISPs also use it for trafﬁc ﬁltering [79].
Leaked Blocklist: While the blocklist used in Russia is not
fully available to the public, we obtained a link to the repository
that has regular updates dating back 7 years, as well as ofﬁcial
copies of the “current” blocklist signed by Roskomnadzor via
our work with activists within Russia. We believe this is the
ﬁrst in-depth study of censorship that has been performed on
an authoritative blocklist intended to be used for censorship.
III. EXPERIMENT DESIGN
Our experiments to measure Internet censorship in Russia
must consider the following factors (1) What to test?–An input
list of sensitive content that censors in Russia are likely to
block, (2) Where to test?–A set of vantage points from where
we can test reachability to websites in the input list, and
(3) How to test?–How can we infer details about censorship
implementation? In this section we describe how we designed
our experiments based on each of these considerations.
A. Acquiring the RUssian BLocklist (RUBL)
We worked extensively with activists within Russia to
identify what websites the Russian government has been
concerned about. This investigation resulted in our discovery
of a leaked blocklist repository [63] with over 26,000 commits
dating back from November, 2012, when Russian Internet
censorship was still in its infancy. This GitHub repository,
Zapret, is well-known within the “Digital Rights guardians”
community and is rumored to represent frequent snapshots of
the daily blocklists received by ISPs.
We also obtained 5 different digitally signed samples of the
blocklist that were distributed by Roskomnadzor, shared with us
from multiple sources. We veriﬁed that these leaked blocklists
are authorized by CN=Роскомнадзор and CN=Единая
информационная система Роскомнадзора (RSOC01001)
which translates to Roskomnadzor, and Uniﬁed Information
System of Roskomnadzor. These blocklists are identical to
what Russian ISPs would receive. We then compared these
blocklists to the Zapret counterpart’s contemporaneous commits
to corroborate the validity of the repository data and found
that the Jaccard similarity between these lists were greater than
0.99. We furnish more details of this validation in Appendix A.
We used the digitally-signed blocklist dated April 24,
2019, which we refer to as RUBL, as the input list for all
our measurements. A single entry in RUBL contains any
combination of IP addresses, IP subnets, domains, and domain
masks (wildcards). We have no knowledge of how and when
DNS resolution was done, or even if resolution was done
at all. If the intent was to block domains, we do not know
how the accompanying IP addresses were obtained, and vice
versa. We break RUBL into RUBLip, RUBLdom, and RUBLsub,
containing the unique IPs, domains, and subnets respectively,
that pass our controls. Since our measurement tools cannot
utilize masks, a domain mask *.domain.com is replaced
with both domain.com and www.domain.com. In total, RUBL
contained 324,695 unique IPs, 132,798 unique domains, and
39 mutually exclusive subnets prior to control measurements
which we explain in the following section. While we mainly
focus on RUBL, we also provide historical analysis of the
Zapret repository commits from November 19, 2012, to April
24, 2019 in Section VI.
B. Establishing Sound Control Measurements
Prior to running the measurements from Russia, we need
to run control tests to remove IP addresses and domains that
are not responsive. To that end, we obtained 13 geographically
diverse control vantage points outside of Russia: 4 in North
America, 4 in Asia, 4 in Europe, and 1 in Australia. To verify
responsive domains, we send a HTTP GET request for every
domain from every control vantage point using ZGrab [92],
an open-source application layer scanner that operates with
ZMap [19]. Our ZGrab tests are customized to follow (a
maximum of 10) redirects. We also resolve each of the domains
from the control vantage point using ZDNS [90], an open-source
command-line utility that provides high-speed DNS lookups. If
we get a response for both tests on at least one control vantage
point, we include it in the ﬁnal list. This resulted in a list of
98,098 (73.9% of the original list) domains, which we will
refer as RUBLdom for the rest of the paper. We characterize
RUBLdom further in section V-B.
We test the responsiveness of the IPs and subnets in RUBLip
and RUBLsub by making TCP connections to port 80 from each
control vantage point using ZMap. If we receive a SYN-ACK
from the IP to at least one of our control vantage points, we
include it in the rest of our measurements. This resulted in
121,025 IP addresses (37.2% of the original list). For RUBLsub,
we excluded 8 subnets out of the total 39 subnets as they didn’t
have any responsive IP addresses. In total, 567,848 IP addresses
(77.2%) were reachable out of 735,232 IP addresses in the
expanded subnets. These ﬁltered lists are what we will refer to

C. Conducting Direct Measurement
1) Obtaining Vantage Points: We perform measurements
from diverse vantage points, including VPSes in data centers
and Probes in residential networks. An overview of the
characteristics of all our vantage points is shown in Table I. To
increase our measurement coverage, we also conduct remote
measurements discussed later on in Section III-D).
• VPSes in Data Centers: With help from activists, we obtained
six reliable VPSes conﬁrmed to be hosted in Russian data
centers, each in a different ISP. We explored obtaining
vantage points from over 35 different providers but many of
them observed no censorship and some were not conducive
to measurement. Renting these machines can only be done
with Russian currency and an in-country phone number and
address.
• Residential Probes: With the insight that different infor-
mation control policies might apply to residential networks
versus data center networks, we also conducted measurements
from residential networks. We recruited fourteen participants
within Russia to run our probe code (the same that was run
at the VPSes, adjusted for lower bandwidth). No information
about the participants’ network was collected, except for
the IP address from which the measurement was performed.
To recruit participants, we used the established process of
OONI [55] and followed the ethical precautions detailed
in Section IV. We attempted to recruit participants from
diverse networks, leading us to cover thirteen ISPs (two of
our probes were in the same ISP).
In total, our direct measurement platform consists of
20 vantage points. With remote measurements, discussed in
Section III-D, we perform measurements from well over 1,000
vantage points. With respect to coverage within Russia, our
vantage points are in 408 unique ASes that control ≈65% of
Russian IP address space, according to Censys [17].
2) Identifying Censorship Methods: With an established
measurement platform and the RUBLdom, RUBLip, and
