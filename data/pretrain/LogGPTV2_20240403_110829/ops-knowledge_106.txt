User: Hi
I use twisted library to connect to FTP server but I have problem with filename encoding.
I receive 'Illusion-N\xf3z.txt' so its not unicode. Is there any FTP command to force specific encoding? 
Thanks in advance!

Assistant: FTP ignores encodings; as long as a filename does not contain a '\0' (null character) and '/' (slash) separates directories, it happily accepts anything.
Do your own decoding and encoding of the filenames. It is quite probable that the encoding used in your example is "cp1252", which is the “Windows Western” or something like that.
In your case, when you receive 'Illusion-N\xf3z.txt', convert it to Unicode by 'Illusion-N\xf3z.txt'.decode('cp1252').
