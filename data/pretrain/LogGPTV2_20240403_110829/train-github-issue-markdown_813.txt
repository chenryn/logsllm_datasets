There are some constants in kubelet and kube-proxy that refers to the same
thing. For example:  
kubernetes/pkg/kubelet/kubelet_network.go
Line 38 in a57561b
|  KubeMarkMasqChain utiliptables.Chain = "KUBE-MARK-MASQ"  
---|---  
kubernetes/pkg/proxy/iptables/proxier.go
Line 71 in 65f3fa9
|  KubeMarkMasqChain utiliptables.Chain = "KUBE-MARK-MASQ"  
---|---  
kubernetes/pkg/kubelet/network/hostport/hostport.go
Line 284 in 57604d1
|  "-s", target.podIP, "-j", string(iptablesproxy.KubeMarkMasqChain),  
---|---  
There must be other cases like this. Propose to have a package to store
constants used by multiple components in one place.
