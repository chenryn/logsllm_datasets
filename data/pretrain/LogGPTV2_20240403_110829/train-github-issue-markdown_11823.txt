    What does 'go version' print?
    go version go1.3.3 darwin/amd64
    What steps reproduce the problem?
    1. go get github.com/mdwhatcott/cycle
    2. cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/mdwhatcott/cycle
    3. go test -cover
    What happened? The go test command hangs indefinitely.
    What should have happened instead? It should report a build failure due to an import
    cycle.
    Please provide any additional information below.
    See the README.md file in the "github.com/mdwhatcott/cycle" package for more
    details.
    I understand that coverage information is only useful when the tests successfully
    compile and execute, but in every other failure to compile, the command in step 3 above
    reports the problem and exits with a non-zero return status. Why should an import cycle
    not cause the same behavior?
