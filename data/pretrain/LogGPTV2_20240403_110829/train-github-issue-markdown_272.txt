### Is there an existing issue for this?
  * I have searched the existing issues
### Current Behavior
Since NPM v7:
When installing a new dependency from a public repository (`github:foo/bar`),
this creates a `git+ssh://PI:EMAIL/foo/bar`) in the `package-lock.json`.
This breaks when running `npm ci` in a GitHub Action because it doesn't have
the SSH agent configured. And it shouldn't need to, because the dependency is
public.
### Expected Behavior
Don't put `git+ssh` there but `github:`.
### Steps To Reproduce
`npm i github:foo/bar`
### Environment
  * OS: macOS Big Sur
  * Node 16
  * npm v7.12.1
