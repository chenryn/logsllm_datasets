User: I have to change file permissions on an executable file, using os.chmod.
I have this executable and I want to change its permissions so that it can write nowhere, only reading and executing.
How can I do that?  
Thanks,
rubik

That's not how chmod works - it sets permissions on the file itself, it can't restrict what an executable can write to.
