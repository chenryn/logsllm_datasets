eε =

(cid:2)
⇒ θ = (cid:2)· (eε − 1) + 1
Thus, to guarantee ε1,ε2 > 0 under a given ε, variable θ should
in the following range
1  0, and Ψ(0.85) ≈ 1. Therefore, we have Φ(cid:3)(θ) (cid:3)

θ0 = eε+1

Therefore, g(θ) approaches to the minimum value at θ = (cid:2)·
(eε−1)/2+1. Note that g(θ) → +∞ when θ → (cid:2)·(eε−1)+1
(the upper bound in (37)), and h(θ) → +∞ when θ → 1 (the
lower bound in (37)). Similar to the proof in Appendix E,
the optimal solution of minimizing g(θ) + h(θ)· m

approximated at θ = (cid:2)· (eε − 1)/2 + 1. Then, we have
k
ε2 = ln [(cid:2)· (eε − 1) + 1]
ε1 = ln[(cid:2)· (eε − 1)/2 + 1],
By combining the results in Case 1 (when (cid:2) = 1) and Case
2 (when (cid:2) > 1), we obtain (22).
