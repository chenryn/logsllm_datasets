# Command Usage and Distribution

## Overview
Figure 10: Command usage distribution.
Command Distribution: Measurement Results. Figure 10 illustrates the distribution of command usage across the dataset. The top four commands are all related to credit card data, either requesting information or purporting to provide card details.

## Popular Commands and Their Meanings
- **!cc**: Request for a free credit card number.
- **!chk**: Request for the valid or invalid status of a credit card.
- **!bank**: Request for the issuing bank of a credit card with a specific prefix.

## Incentives for Market Administration
A natural question is what makes the risks associated with running this market worthwhile. While operating the market incurs a level of risk, it also provides an opportunity to easily acquire wealth. Administrators can leverage the channel service bot commands to gather valuable information related to credit card numbers. Miscreants frequently use these commands to assess the value of their stolen data.

### Treachery: Measurement Methodology
After analyzing the source code of one channel services bot and examining requests and responses, we found that commands like !chk, !cclimit, and !cvv2 are likely fallacious. For example, the !cclimit command parses the provided credit card number and returns a deterministic response without querying a database or attempting a transaction to determine the cardâ€™s limit. One possible explanation is that channel administrators use these bots to steal credit card numbers from other participants. We measured the usage of the !cclimit command to estimate how often naive participants give away sensitive data. We checked the card numbers provided as arguments to the command by performing a Luhn check and removing duplicates.

### Treachery: Measurement Results
Figure 11 shows the number of !cclimit commands issued with previously unseen card numbers. The command was issued a total of 129,464 times. We parsed the responses and found 25,696 unique cards, approximately one quarter of the total unique cards in the corpus. These include 17,065 Visa, 6,705 Mastercard, 1,318 American Express, and 608 Discover cards.

An average of 451 new cards are submitted to the command per day. Despite the expectation that the number of requests to the !cclimit command would decline as miscreants discover its constant response, our measurements suggest that usage is generally increasing over time. Possible explanations include the submission of fake data or the continuous influx of new participants who are tricked into using the command.

## Goods, Services, and Prices
