Commands
Figure 10: Command usage distribution.
Command Distribution: Measurement Results. Figure 10 shows
the distribution of command usage over the dataset. The top four
commands are all associated with credit card data, either requesting
data or purporting to provide card information.

Table 6: Description of channel service bot commands.
A natural question to ask is what makes the risks associated with
running this market worthwhile, or, equivalently, “What are the in-
centives for the market’s administration?” While operating the mar-
ket incurs a level of risk, it also provides an opportunity to easily
acquire wealth. To understand the ease with which administrators
may acquire wealth, one need look no further than the channel ser-
vice bot commands. The channel services bot provides a number of
commands which return information related to credit card numbers.
Miscreants make constant use of these commands in an attempt to
assess the wealth of their stolen data.
Treachery: Measurement Methodology. After analyzing the
source code for one channel services bot and looking through re-
quests and responses in the corpus, we believe that the !chk, !cclimit,
and !cvv2 are fallacious. For example, the !cclimit command parses
the credit card number provided and returns a deterministic re-
sponse without querying a database or attempting a transaction to
infer the card’s limit. One possible explanation for this ﬁnding is
that the channel administrators run the channel bots as a way to
steal credit card numbers from other participants. We measure the
usage of one fallacious command to estimate the extent to which
naive participants give away sensitive data. We check the card num-
bers provided as arguments to the command by performing a Luhn
check and remove duplicates.
Treachery: Measurement Results.
Figure 11 shows the num-
ber of !cclimit commands issued which contain previously unseen
card number. The command was issued a total of 129,464 times.
We parsed responses to the command and found 25,696 unique
cards, approximately one quarter of the total number of unique
cards found in the corpus. These include 17,065 Visa, 6,705 Mas-
tercard, 1,318 American Express, and 608 Discover cards.

Figure 11: CClimit checks over time.
An average of 451 new cards are submitted to the command per
day. One expects the number of requests to the !cclimit command
to decline over time as miscreants discover that the command pro-
vides a constant response over time. However, our measurements
suggest that usage of the command is generally increasing over
time. Possible explanations for this increase include that the data
being submitted to the !cclimit command is fake or new partici-
pants continuously join the channel and are tricked into using the
command.
4. GOODS, SERVICES, AND PRICES
In this section, we measure the number of sales and want ads for
goods and services offered in the channel. The measurements in
this section use both manual measurements and semantic measure-
ments employing supervised machine-learning techniques.
