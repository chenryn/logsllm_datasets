Could you please specify which version of ShardingSphere you are using?
- 3.1.0

Which project are you using: Sharding-JDBC or Sharding-Proxy?
- Sharding-JDBC

If I use a single ZooKeeper (ZK) center for both Sharding-JDBC and Sharding-Proxy, and I have multiple schemas, how can I ensure that the Sharding-JDBC in my application is aware of which schema it should use?
