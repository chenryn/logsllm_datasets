#### 3.1.3. System Information Type and Categorization

The following tables specify the information types processed, stored, or transmitted by the system and its in-boundary supply chain. Enterprises use [NIST SP 800-60 v2], [NARA CUI], or other enterprise-specific information types to identify and categorize information. Using [FIPS 199] guidance, the enterprise determines the security impact levels (low, moderate, high) for each information type based on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Table D-6: System Information Type and Categorization**

| Information Type | Confidentiality (Low, Moderate, High) | Integrity (Low, Moderate, High) | Availability (Low, Moderate, High) |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
|                  |                                       |                                 |                                   |

Based on the table above, indicate the highest impact level (high-water mark) for each security objective and determine the overall system categorization.

**Table D-7: Security Impact Categorization**

| Security Objective | Security Impact Level (Low, Moderate, High) |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|

### 4. Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Assessment Template

The Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Assessment (C-SCRA) guides the review of any third-party product, service, or supplier that could present a cybersecurity risk to a procurer. The objective of the C-SCRA template is to provide a toolbox of questions that an acquirer can choose to use depending on the controls selected. Typically executed by C-SCRM PMOs at the operational level (Level 3), the C-SCRA considers available public and private information to perform a holistic assessment, including known cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain, the likelihoods of their occurrence, and their potential impacts on an enterprise and its information and systems. Enterprises should evaluate the relative priority of their C-SCRAs to influence the rigor of the assessment.
