The DMS is a Category 1 system that mandates a recovery time objective (RTO) of 1 hour in the 
event of downtime. The enterprise maintains a disaster recovery environment with a second 
private cloud provider to which the enterprise can switch if the Category 1 RTO is not likely to 
be met on the primary platform.

3.1.3. System Information Type and Categorization 
The following tables specify the information types that are processed, stored, or transmitted by 
the system and/or its in-boundary supply chain. Enterprises utilize [NIST SP 800-60 v2], [NARA 
CUI], or other enterprise-specific information types to identify information types and provisional 
impact levels. Using guidance regarding the categorization of federal information and systems in 
[FIPS 199], the enterprise determines the security impact levels for each information type. 
Articulate the impact level (i.e., low, moderate, high) for each security objective (i.e., 
confidentiality, integrity, availability).

SR‐6 SUPPLIER ASSESSMENTS AND REVIEWS 
Implementation: As a part of a comprehensive, defense‐in‐breadth information security strategy, 
the enterprise established a C-SCRM program to address the management of cybersecurity risks 
throughout the supply chain. The C-SCRM PMO is responsible for conducting assessments of 
cybersecurity risks that arise from business partners seeking to integrate with [system name] in 
accordance with enterprise‐wide C-SCRM Level 2 policy requirements. C-SCRM training and 
awareness materials must also be provided for all individuals prior to receiving access to [system 
name].  
Control Enhancements: Control enhancements 2, 7 and 8 from [NIST 800‐161] are applicable.  
(2) SUPPLIER REVIEWS  
Implementation: The C-SCRM PMO provides supplier reviews to business partners in the 
form of SCRAs before entering into a contractual agreement to acquire information systems, 
components, or services in relation to [system name]. The Level 1 strategy and Level 2 
policy documents place SCRA requirements on business partners seeking to acquire IT 
systems, components, and/or services. The SCRA provides a step‐by‐step guide for business 
partners to follow in preparation for an assessment of suppliers by the C-SCRM PMO.  
(7) ASSESSMENT PRIOR TO SELECTION/ACCEPTANCE/UPDATE  
Implementation: The Level 2 policy defines what [system name] integration activities require 
an SCRA. The process and requirements are defined in the SCRA Standard Operating 
Procedure. 
(8) USE OF ALL‐SOURCE INTELLIGENCE  
Implementation: The C-SCRM PMO utilizes all‐source intelligence when conducting supply 
chain risk assessments for [system name]. 
3.1.8. Role Identification 
Identify the role, name, department/division, primary and alternative phone number, and email 
address of key cybersecurity supply chain personnel or designate contacts (e.g., vendor contacts, 
acquisitions subject matter experts [SME], engineering leads, business partners, service 
providers) with a role, name, address, primary and alternative phone numbers, and email 
address.

3.1.9. Contingencies and Emergencies 
For organizations that choose to acquires products in the event of contingency or emergency 
operations, enterprises may need to bypass normal C-SCRM acquisition processes to allow for 
mission continuity. Contracting activities that are not vetted using approved C-SCRM plan 
processes introduce operational risks to the enterprise. 
Where appropriate, describe abbreviated acquisition procedures to follow during contingencies 
and emergencies, such as the contact information for C-SCRM, acquisitions, and legal subject 
matter experts who can provide advice absent a formal tasking and approval chain of command. 
Sample Text 
In the event of an emergency where equipment is urgently needed, the C-SCRM PMO will offer 
its assistance through C-SCRM subject matter experts (SMEs) to provide help in the absence of 
formal tasking and chain of command approval. The CIO has the authority to provide such 
waivers to bypass normal procedures. The current contact information for C-SCRM SMEs is

C-SCRM plans should cover the full SDLC of systems and programs, including research and 
development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations, and 
disposal/retirement. The C-SCRM plan activities should be integrated into the enterprise’s 
system and software life cycle processes. Similar controls in the C-SCRM plan can be applied in 
more than one life cycle process. The figure below shows how the C-SCRM plan activities can 
be integrated into various example life cycles.

4. CYBERSECURITY SUPPLY CHAIN RISK ASSESSMENT TEMPLATE 
The Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Assessment (C-SCRA)43 guides the review of any third-
party product, service, or supplier44 that could present a cybersecurity risk to a procurer. The 
objective of the C-SCRA template is to provide a toolbox of questions that an acquirer can 
choose to use or not use depending on the controls selected. Typically executed by C-SCRM 
PMOs at the operational level (Level 3), the C-SCRAC-SCRA considers available public and 
private information to perform a holistic assessment, including known cybersecurity risks 
throughout the supply chain, the likelihoods of their occurrence, and their potential impacts on an 
enterprise and its information and systems. As enterprises may be inundated with C-SCRAC-
SCRAs and suppliers inundated with C-SCRAC-SCRA requests, the enterprise should evaluate 
the relative priority of its C-SCRAC-SCRAs as an influencing factor on the rigor of the C-
SCRAC-SCRA.  
As with the other featured templates, the below C-SCRAC-SCRA is provided only as an 
example. Enterprises must tailor the below content to align with their Level 1 and Level 2 risk 
postures. The execution of C-SCRAC-SCRA is perhaps the most visible and time-consuming 
component of C-SCRM operations and must therefore be designed for efficient execution at 
scale with dedicated support resources, templated workflows, and automation wherever possible. 
Federal agencies should refer to Appendix E for additional guidance concerning supply chain 
risk assessments.
