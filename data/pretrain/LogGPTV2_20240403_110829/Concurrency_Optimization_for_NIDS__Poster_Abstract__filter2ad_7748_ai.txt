Multiomic data integration using machine learning and data-driven inverse metabolic modelling -  
from diabetes to immune system modulation
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Wolfram Weckwerth, University of Vienna, Austria
An integrated proteomics/phosphoproteomics/metabolomics platform is presented This platform serves also as the basis for the Vienna Metabolomics 
Center (VIME) (https://metabolomicsunivieacat/) The data mining strategy is based on the integrative toolbox COVAIN (COVAriance INverse) for data 
processing, integration, multivariate statistical analysis, machine learning and data-drive inverse metabolic modelling [1] We applied this integrative 
workflow to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) [2] and to the analysis of mTOR-dependent immune system modulation [3] Activation of immune cells is 
accompanied by a metabolic reconfiguration of their cellular energy metabolism including shifts in glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration that critically 
regulate functional effector responses However, while current mass spectrometry strategies identify overall or flux-dependent metabolite profiles of 
cells or tissues, they fail to comprehensively identify the checkpoint nodes and enzymes that are responsible for different metabolic outputs Here, we 
demonstrate that a data-driven inverse modelling approach from mass spectrometry metabolomics data can be used to identify causal biochemical nodes 
that influence overall metabolic profiles and reactions Using multiomics metabolomics, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, transcriptomics analysis as well 
as enzymatic activity measurements we identified metabolic signatures of energy signaling and macrophage differentiation The presented concept of 
multiomics analysis, machine learning and data-driven inverse modelling allows for systematic integration of genome-scale metabolic reconstruction, 
prediction and analysis of causal biochemical regulation in microbes, plants, animals, human and their interactions

PRESENTING AUTHOR: Drupad Trivedi, University of Manchester, United Kingdom
CO-AUTHORS: Eleanor Sinclair, Depanjan Sarkar, Joy Milne, Monty Silverdale, Tilo Kunath, Roy Goodacre, Perdita Barran
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects ageing population and around 1 in every 350 adults is diagnosed in the UK 
with Parkinson’s disease (PD) Currently there are no definite diagnostic tests that can detect PD at early stages This research is an effort towards early 
diagnosis of PD using biomarkers on skin, which anecdotally is known to smell differently in PD than in control Sebum swabs from upper back of 276 
participants consisting of PD on medication (n=139), drug naive PD (n=81) and control (n = 56) participants were collected across 28 different NHS sites in 
the UK High-performance liquid chromatography was couple to time-of-flight mass spectrometry for separation and detection of metabolites extracted 
from sebum samples After pre-processing, the resultant 700 features were carried forward for statistical analyses Machine learning techniques consisting 
of support vector machines (SVM) and random forests (RF) were used for classification of data into two groups by using two subsets: (i) control and drug 
naive (ii) control and PD on medication The metabolome measured was able to achieve classification accuracy by SVM and RF Pathway enrichment 
analysis using all detected and identified metabolites showed significant enrichment (p < 005) of primary bile acid biosynthesis, sphingolipid metabolism, 
D-Arginine and D-ornithine metabolism as well as arginine and proline metabolism Our results indicate a significant shift of endogenous metabolome in 
PD, causing an enhanced effect reflected on lipid-like molecules that are captured on the skin sebum

Patient-derived cellular models are a powerful approach to study human disease, especially neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s Disease, 
where affected primary neurons, eg, substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons, are almost inaccessible Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived models of 
midbrain-specific dopaminergic neurons are increasingly used to investigate Parkinson’s Disease Starting with the comprehensive generic reconstruction 
of human metabolism, Recon3D, we generated the first constraint-based, genome-scale, in silico model of human dopaminergic neuronal metabolism 
(iNESC2DN) Transcriptomic data, obtained by RNA sequencing, and quantitative exometabolomic data, obtained by targeted mass spectrometry-based 
metabolomics were generated for in vitro neuroepithelial stem cell-derived cultures and supplemented by extensive manual curation of the literature 
on dopaminergic neurons The predictions of the iNESC2DN model are consistent with neurobiochemical prior information and in concordance with 
measured fluxes of uptake and secretion of many extracellular metabolites by dopaminergic neurons in vitro We leverage it to rank order the most 
important metabolite concentrations to quantify to maximally reduce the uncertainty associated with current predictions of normal dopaminergic neuronal 
metabolism in vitro, as well as optimally design experiments to measure metabolic perturbations associated with Parkinson’s Disease Finally, the 
iNESC2DN model provides a foundation for future targeted metabolomic and tracer-based metabolomic analyses of dopaminergic neurons This illustrates 
the synergy between constraint-based computational modelling of metabolism and biology-driven quantitative bioanalytical chemistry

Interleaving metabolic effects of sleep and aging
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Arjun Sengupta, University of Pennsylvania, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Jennifer Choi Tudor, Joseph Baur, Ted Abel, Aalim Weljie
Decreased sleep is a hallmark of modern society Environmental factors such as stress as well as biological factors such as aging contributes to 
decreased sleep quantity and quality Sleep deprivation (SD) has been linked to life threatening complications including learning and memory related 
neurodegenerative diseases and cardiometabolic disorders The role of metabolic disruption in physiological effects of SD is emerging, but not 
completely understood The nature of the interaction of SD with aging phenotypes is also unclear Here we used a mouse model of 5 h acute sleep 
deprivation in young adult (2-4 months) and aged (20-22 months) mice to capture metabolic shifts as function of SD Remarkably, numerous metabolites 
were perturbed post SD in young (24, 61, 53 metabolites in hippocampi, liver, and plasma, respectively) and aged animals (17, 42, 38 metabolites) Young 
animals demonstrated greater metabolic susceptibility post acute SD than aged animals Specific SD metabolites in young animals (5, 19, 15 metabolites 
in hippocampi, plasma and liver, respectively) recapitulated a portion of the aging signature, thus demonstrating how SD makes the ‘young seem old’ 
Hepatic signatures of ketosis were common to both groups, with greater prominence in the young animals Altered hepatic NAD metabolism and urea 
cycle was also common signature of SD Choline and acetylcholine pool in the young animals was specifically depleted in hippocampi, potentially 
linking metabolism to SD induced alteration in memory consolidation These results form a foundation for understanding the systemic metabolic effects 
of sleep deprivation and aging

Analysis of changes in the eye lens and aqueous humor under cataract development using  
quantitative metabolomics
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Vadim Yanshole, ITC SB RAS / NSU, Russian Federation
CO-AUTHORS: Lyudmila Yanshole, Olga Snytnikova, Yuri Tsentalovich
Introduction: The most common vision impairment of older people is caused by the formation of cataract (clouding of the eye lens) The protection of 
the lens is almost solely provided by metabolites; most of them are synthesized in the lens epithelium or enter the lens through the epithelial layer from 
the surrounding aqueous humor (AH) Therefore, changes in the metabolome of the lens and AH may help to establish the molecular mechanisms of the 
cataract onset Methods: Quantitative metabolomic profiles of eye tissue extracts (lens, AH) were obtained with the combination of three methods – high-
frequency 1H NMR and ion-pairing HPLC with optical (LC-OD) and high-resolution ESI-q-TOF MS detection (LC-MS) methods Results: The concentrations 
of more than 80 metabolites were determined for four groups of samples: lenses and AH from cataract patients and lenses and AH from human cadavers 
Conclusion: Our metabolomic data confirm the hypothesis that although the age-related cataract usually manifests itself as the opacification of the lens 
nucleus, the initial site of the cataract onset might be the lens epithelial layer The most important for the lens protection metabolites – antioxidants, UV 
filters, osmolytes – are synthesized in the lens epithelial cells The reduced levels of these metabolites were found in the cataractous lenses; that indicates 
that the cataract development may originate from the dysfunction of the lens epithelial cells The increase in the concentrations in non-cataractous post-
mortem tissues for other metabolites corresponds to the post-mortem processes Acknowledgements: Supported by the RFBR (projects 18-33-20097,

Rapid Evaporative Ionisation Mass Spectrometry for detecting compounds related to consumer liking of meat
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Alastair Ross, AgResearch, New Zealand
CO-AUTHORS: Paul Middlewood, Stefan Clerens, Patricia L Johnson, Arvind Subbaraj, Patrick Silcock, Graham T Eyres, Carolina E Realini
Unbiased measurement of chemical components related to consumer liking is important for continuous improvement of breeding and meat processing 
for higher eating quality meat products, yet tools available for this purpose are limited Rapid Evaporative Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (REIMS) is a mass 
spectrometry interface initially developed for surgery that allows real time analysis of samples, and is especially well suited for rapid analysis of meat We 
hypothesised that within the metabolic signature of meat obtained using REIMS, it would be possible to detect compounds related to consumer liking In 
a pilot study, 150 lambs were randomly selected within 10 different commercial mobs (n=15/group), and a 2 x 2 x 1 cm loin sample (Longissimus lumborum) 
collected for REIMS analysis REIMS analysis was carried out in triplicate on 149 available samples in both positive and negative ionisation modes during 
two days Associations between consumer panel (n=160 panellists) data and REIMS fingerprints were performed using PLS and OPLS-DA modelling, and 
confirmed using Pearson correlation (overall correlations) and ANOVA (between group differences) Meat with the highest overall liking scores was higher 
in compounds that are associated with aromatic amino acid biosynthesis and breakdown, while meat with lower overall liking scores was associated with 
a higher proportion of phospholipids Using REIMS it was possible to detect compounds that were related to consumer liking of meat In the future, this 
approach could be used to complement grading systems for identifying and predicting meat cuts with characteristics that maximize eating quality, and 
aiding consumer-driven breeding programmes

Fiber mix supplementation in wheat-based flatbreads delays the exogenous appearance of glucose and its 
downstream metabolites
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Lisa Schlicker, BRICS, TU Braunschweig, Germany
CO-AUTHORS: Lisa Schlicker, Hanny M. Boers, Christian-Alexander Dudek, Gang Zhao, Jean-Pierre Trezzi, Doris M. Jacobs and Karsten Hiller
In nutritional intervention studies, the use of fully isotopically enriched plant material instead of single compound tracers enables deep insights into 
the postprandial catabolism of plant components (eg starch or protein) Due to its limited availability, only marginal amounts can be included in these 
studies, resulting in labeled plasma metabolites with 13C enrichment below natural enrichment of 11%, thus accurate quantification is analytically 
challenging In a first step, we therefore developed an optimized mass spectrometry-based analytical workflow to achieve accurate quantification of 
13C-enrichment in selected plasma metabolites below 1%  In a second step, we applied our workflow to plasma samples of a nutritional intervention 
study investigating the postprandial effects of fiber supplementation in wheat-based flatbreads In this cross-over study, 12 healthy male subjects 
consumed flatbreads of different compositions: wheat flour (control) and wheat flour supplemented with 15% chickpea flour and different amounts of  
guar gum (2%: GG2, 4% GG4) We obtained time-resolved 13C enrichment profiles of 12 plasma metabolites namely glucose, lactate, alanine, glycine, 
serine, citrate, glutamate, glutamine, valine, isoleucine, tyrosine and threonine While the postprandial metabolome was only mildly affected, fiber mix 
supplementation had a significant impact on the postprandial appearance of food-derived metabolites in the blood Most interestingly, we found that 
fiber supplementation not only decreased the exogenous appearance of glucose In addition, the appearance of the glucose-derived metabolites 
lactate and alanine was significantly reduced The obtained data demonstrate the limitations of metabolite profiling and highlight that in vivo labeling 
contributes to a better understanding of nutritional interventions

A metabolomic approach to the identification and validation of biomarkers of apple intake
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Aoife McNamara, Institute of Food and Health, Ireland
CO-AUTHORS: Helena Gibbons, Diana Gonzalez-Pena, Breige McNulty, Lorraine Brennan
The potential of individual food-intake biomarkers to objectively measure diet is a research area of interest Improvements in dietary assessment are 
necessary to elucidate diet/health associations The objective of this study was to identify novel biomarkers of apple intake and explore their potential 
to determine intake Twenty volunteers consumed 360g of apples as part of an acute feeding study Postprandial urine samples were collected at 
2, 4 and 24 hours post-apple consumption for analysis Subsequently a dose-response study was performed where volunteers consumed different 
portions of apples (50g, 100g or 300g) and fasting urine samples were collected for analysis Xylose was quantified analysed on a 600-MHz Varian 
NMR spectrometer using the first increment of a NOESY pulse sequence Dose-response data was used to develop calibration curves to determine 
apple intake in an independent free-living cohort (n=565) and used to classify individuals into categories of apple-intake Multivariate analysis of NMR 
metabolomic data and time-series plots revealed that urinary xylose concentrations increased significantly at 4h post-apple consumption (219uM/
osm), compared to the control food- broccoli (034uM/osm) In the dose-response study, urinary xylose concentrations demonstrated a linear increase 
as apple-intake increased (r=0406; p<00001) Urinary xylose concentrations quantified in the free-living cohort (005 to 146mM) obtained strong 
agreement between biomarker-based intake classification and self-reported intake classification Urinary xylose increased with increasing apple-intake 
Xylose performed well as a ranking biomarker for grouping into apple-intake categories Future work will combine xylose with other markers which may 
allow for determination of intake at an individual level

Brainfood metabolomics study (Icebreaker, Brave sub-study)
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Kati Hanhineva, Afekta Technologies Ltd., Finland
CO-AUTHORS: Kati Hanhineva, Marika Laaksonen, Sanna-Maria Hongisto, Juhani Sibakov, Heli Diaz, Anton Mattsson, Ville Koistinen, Jussi Loponen
Background: Cognitive performance is related to glucose metabolism and metabolic activation that are regulated by dietary factors We studied the effects 
of brain-friendly diet (Brainfood) on metabolic and physiological parameters and cognitive performance in office workers at assumed metabolic risk (Brave 
study) Materials and methods: We conducted a diet-switch, 4-week intervention study on 84 volunteers with elevated plasma LDL levels in pre-screening 
The Brainfood diet focused on regular meal frequency and optimal intake of polyunsaturated fats, fibre and salt, whereas the control diet was a typical 
western diet Plasma samples were collected at the end of the lead-in, control and intervention periods, and analysed using liquid chromatography 
mass spectrometry (UPLC–QTOF-MS) Intervention efficacy was determined with a linear mixed model, and the fold changes of the metabolite levels 
were tested with t-tests corrected with Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) Results: In total, we identified 37 differential metabolites (FDR-
corrected p < 005), including acylcarnitines, amino acids, choline, 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropionic acid (CMPF), methylimidazoleacetic 
acid, monoacylglycerols, phospho¬lipids, piperine, and retinol Several phosphatidylcholines and plasmalogens containing polyunsaturated fatty acids 
increased after the Brainfood diet, whereas lipids containing saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids decreased The individual variability in metabolites 
was larger compared to the intervention effect Conclusions: The Brainfood diet increased levels of CMPF and polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing 
phospholipids, likely originating from the intake of fatty fish The reduced consumption of animal fats decreased their corresponding fatty acids in the lipid 
profile Increased 3-methylhistidine was observed as a potential marker of poultry and plant-based protein intake

Mass spectrometry based non-targeted metabolomics enables the identification of Amadori products in  
feces of formula-fed infants
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Alesia Walker, Helmholtz Zentrum München, Research Unit Analytical BioGeochemistry, Germany
CO-AUTHORS: Nina Sillner, Daniel Hemmler, Monika Bazanella, Silke S. Heinzmann, Dirk Haller, Philippe Schmitt-Kopplin
Non-targeted metabolomics can be used to identify food markers, without prior focusing on a set of small molecule ingredients or known food metabolites 
Our interest was to investigate fecal metabolite profiles of breast- and formula-fed infants during the first year of life by LC-MS/MS and a subset by FT-
ICR-MS We observed that fecal samples of one month old infants, fed with whey-based formula milk, were dominated by four m/z values assigned as 
nitrogen containing compounds (C18H34N2O8, C24H44N2O13, C12H24N2O7 and C18H34N2O12), analyzed by FT-ICR-MS HMBD annotation using m/z 
values resulted in one putative matching of fructosyllysine (FruLys), which is one of the most abundant Amadori products derived from food Identification 
of four putative Amadori products was done with HILIC LC-MS/MS Fragmentation experiments showed loss of a dipeptide for two features and multiple 
loss of water for all features, which is typical for glucose/ lactose moieties The dipeptide fragment was assigned to leucylisoleucine (LeuIle), which is 
present at the N-terminal sequence of the major whey protein β-lactoglobulin The other two fragmented features showed typical lysine fragments Based 
on the fragmentation, we identified two LeuIle and two Lys Amadori products (FruLeuIle, LactulosylLeuIle, FruLys and LactulosylLys) Three of them were 
synthesized, fractionated and characterized by NMR, while FruLys was available as authentic chemical standard All compounds were not detected in 
breastfed children and fecal levels of Amadori products decreased over time in formula-fed children due to solid food introduction Thus, LeuIle Amadori 
compounds could serve as food markers for consumption of whey-based formula milk

Our group specializes in the development and maintenance of expert curated knowledge resources for the life sciences Here we describe recent 
work designed to improve the utility of these knowledge resources for integrated computational and experimental analyses of metabolic systems Our 
starting point for this work is Rhea (wwwrhea-dborg), a comprehensive expert-curated knowledgebase of over 11,500 biochemical reactions that uses 
the ChEBI (Chemical Entities of Biological Interest) ontology of small molecules to describe reaction participants, their chemical structures, and chemical 
transformations We recently introduced Rhea as the standard for the annotation of enzymatic reactions in the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB, at 
wwwuniprotorg) UniProtKB is a reference resource of protein sequences and functional annotation that currently includes over 150 million sequences 
and thousands of proteomes from all branches of the tree of life The introduction of Rhea will significantly enhance the utility of UniProtKB as a basis to 
integrate and analyse metabolomic, proteomic and genomic data, to generate and annotate metabolic networks and models, to mine reaction data for 
pathway prediction and metabolic engineering, and to map metabolites to human diseases and associated genes and variants We will describe selected 
tools and services that leverage Rhea and UniProt and practical examples of how to use them We will conclude by describing how we use curated 
knowledge of lipid metabolic pathways in Rhea and cheminformatics approaches to build SwissLipids (wwwswisslipidsorg), a resource of over 500,000 
known and theoretically possible lipid structures and biological knowledge that is fully mapped to ChEBI, Rhea and UniProt

Metabolome data provide new opportunities to gain a deeper understanding of plant metabolism relevant to both, plant and human health benefits Major 
public repositories for general metabolome data have been launched over the past decade, but in terms of data sharing, many aspects remain unresolved 
especially for improving reanalysis, reusability and reproducibility In this study, we developed the RIKEN Plant Metabolome MetaDatabase (RIKEN PMM, 
http://metabobankrikenjp/), which stores gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based (ie GC-MS-based) metabolite profiling data of plants together 
with their detailed experimental metadata, including sampling and experimental procedures Our metadata are described using the Resource Description 
Framework (RDF) and standardised vocabularies, such as the Metabolomics Standardization Initiative Application Ontology (MSI-AO), to integrate with 
other life and biomedical science data on the World Wide Web The RIKEN PMM implements intuitive and interactive operations for plant metabolome 
data, including raw data, mass spectra and metabolite annotations The RIKEN PMM is suitable not only for scientists who are interested in metabolomic 
phenotypes but also for researchers who would like to investigate plant metabolomics approaches Our framework can provide enough metadata required 
for reanalyzing and reusing the raw data, and will contribute to the development of yet another general-purpose metabolomics repository

Contextualizing Metabolomics Data by Integrating Text Mining and Machine Learning
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Magnus Palmblad, Leiden University Medical Center, Netherlands
The scientific literature contains a wealth of information for text mining and machine learning in the public domain, including Europe PMC with 35 million 
titles and abstracts, and 23 million open access papers Much work has been done on extracting functional protein interactions and linking genes to 
diseases Here I will describe how text mining chemical entities, with emphasis on metabolites, can be combined with machine learning and large-scale 
prediction of physicochemical properties to guide the selection of analytical methods in metabolomics, assess bias in metabolomics datasets, and place 
metabolomics data in wider contexts The method is automated in scientific workflows, greatly facilitating its reuse and adaptation Particular emphasis 
is placed on how to visualize the results from millions of named-entity recognitions in tens of thousands of articles in a single, informative, figure The 
visualization styles may be new in the text mining but should be intuitive to practitioners of mass spectrometry-based metabolomics Applications include 
drug development, data integration and business intelligence
