User: 你作为资深数据库管理员，帮助解答一些数据库故障诊断问题。请描述 unused_and_redundant_index 如何作为数据库性能问题的根因排查
Assistant: This function checks for the presence of unused or redundant indexes in a table that is related to a query. Unused indexes are those that have not been used for a long time, while redundant indexes are those that are not needed for the query. If the table is not large or there are no unused or redundant indexes, or if the query involves a select operation, then the function is not a root cause. Otherwise, the function identifies the unused and redundant indexes and provides suggestions to clean them up. The threshold for identifying unused indexes is not specified in the code.

辅助排查的数据来自以下prometheus性能监控指标：- Large table
- Unused index info
- Redundant index info
- Select type
