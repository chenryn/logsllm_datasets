Bug
**What is the current behavior?**
Webpack file watcher ignores changes in symlinked files if `resolve >
symlinks` options is set to `false`.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
I have created a minimal reproducible repo to test the issue:
  * go to `./project`
  * do `npm ci`
  * then start local server by running `npm run server`
  * start Webpack file watcher by running `npm run watch`
  * change the file in `./package/Logger` (you could try changing the message getter for example, this way the changes are easy to see)
**What is the expected behavior?**
The changes made in `Logger` module should appear on the page (e.g. `Logger`
should append a different message). Instead Webpack doesn't re-build the
`Logger` module.
I found a similar issue here.
**If this is a feature request, what is motivation or use case for changing
the behavior?**
**Please mention other relevant information such as the browser version,
Node.js version, webpack version, and Operating System.**
**Node.js version** 12.19.0
**Webpack version** 5.10.3
