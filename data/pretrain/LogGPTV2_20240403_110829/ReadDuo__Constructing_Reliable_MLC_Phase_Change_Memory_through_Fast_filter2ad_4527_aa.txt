Abstract‚ÄîPhase change memory (PCM) has emerged as
a promising non-volatile memory technology. Multi-level cell
(MLC) PCM, while effectively reducing per bit fabrication
cost, suffers from resistance drift based soft errors. It is
challenging to construct reliable MLC chips that achieve high
performance, high storage density, and low energy consumption
simultaneously.
In this paper, we propose ReadDuo, a fast and robust
readout solution to address resistance drift in MLC PCM.
We Ô¨Årst integrate fast current sensing and resistance drift
resilient voltage sensing, which exposes performance opti-
mization opportunities without sacriÔ¨Åcing reliability. We then
devise last writes tracking and selective different write schemes
to minimize performance and energy consumption overhead
in scrubbing. Our experimental results show that ReadDuo
achieves 37% improvement on average over existing solutions
when considering performance, dynamic energy consumption,
and storage density all together.

I. INTRODUCTION
Phase Change Memory (PCM) [20] is an emerging mem-
ory technology that takes advantage of the stable resistance
states of phase change material (e.g., GST) to record data.
A PCM cell, when having currents injected through the
cell, can be programmed to either fully crystalline state
or fully amorphous state, ranging from several kilo Œ©s to
several million Œ©s [21]. Given the large resistance difference
between these two states, MLC (multi-level cell) PCM has
been devised to utilize the middle resistance states to store
multiple bits in one cell. As a comparison, SLC (single-level
cell) PCM uses only full crystalline state and full amorphous
state, and stores only one bit in each cell.
The resistance of a PCM cell increases after write, which
is referred to as resistance drift. While both SLC PCM and
MLC PCM have resistance drift, the latter is more vulnerable
because its middle resistance states are not as stable as the
fully crystalline state and the resistance range of each MLC
state is often very tight. Resistance drift has been identiÔ¨Åed
as the main source of soft errors in MLC PCM and a major
obstacle that restricts MLC PCM from wide adoption.
Designs have been proposed to mitigate the resistance
drift in MLC PCM. EfÔ¨Åcient scrubbing [2] periodically scans

MLC lines for resistance drift errors and, if found, rewrites
all the cells in a drifted line after correction. This scheme
tends to consume large memory bandwidth and write energy
if we want to match the reliability of MLC PCM chips
to that of today‚Äôs DRAM chips. Tri-Level-Cell (TLC) [26]
removes the most drift-prone state in four-level MLC design,
making a trade off between density and reliability. Helmet
[34] was proposed to adopt more precise MLC write control
and data encoding to mitigate resistance drift. M-metric
[23] is a recently proposed readout metric that conducts
drift resilient voltage sensing (rather than traditional current
sensing, referred to as R-metric). A M-metric based readout
scheme requires much longer latency to differentiate the
stored data. In summary, it remains challenging to design
a drift resilient scheme that achieves high performance and
low energy consumption while maintaining the same density
and endurance as those in drift-free MLC PCM.
In this paper, we address the challenge using a hybrid
readout solution that integrates voltage sensing and current
sensing. We strive to achieve the best
tradeoff among
performance, energy consumption, storage density and chip
lifetime. We summarize our contributions as follows.
‚Ä¢ We propose ReadDuo, a hybrid readout solution that
integrates fast current sensing and resistance drift re-
silient voltage sensing. In the Hybrid design, R-metric
sensing helps to improve read performance while M-
metric sensing helps to meet DRAM reliability with
low overhead scrubbing.
‚Ä¢ We propose Last Writes Tracking and Selective Rewrite
schemes to minimize performance and energy con-
sumption overhead in scrubbing. Last Write Tracking
enables relaxed M-metric scrubbing without sacriÔ¨Åcing
R-sensing reliability. Selective Rewrite reduces the av-
erage number of cell writes in most write operations
and save energy consumption.
‚Ä¢ We evaluate the proposed schemes with comparison to
the state-of-the-art. A new metric EDAP (Energy Delay
Area Product) is used to evaluate the trade off among
energy consumption, performance and storage density.
Our results show that, on average, ReadDuo achieves
37% improvements over existing schemes.
In the rest of the paper, we brieÔ¨Çy review the background
in Section II. We elaborate the design details in Section III.
The experiment methodology and results are discussed in
Section IV and Section V, respectively. We discuss more
related work in Section VI and conclude the paper in
Section VII.
II. BACKGROUND
A. Multi-level Phase Change Memory
PCM takes advantage of the stable states of chalcogenide
material such as GST [35], [12] to record data. MLC
PCM [32], e.g., a 2-bit MLC PCM in Figure 1, partitions the
resistance range between full crystalline state (several kilo
Œ©s) and full amorphous state (several million Œ©s) to four
resistance subranges, i.e., states.
Reading MLC PCM needs to compare a cell‚Äôs resistance
to three reference cells (denoted as Ref1/2/3) in two rounds
‚Äî the resistance is Ô¨Årst compared to Ref2 and then, based
on the comparison results, compared to either Ref1 or Ref3.
The stored data is determined based on the comparison
results at two steps.
Writing MLC PCM often adopts iterative program and
verify (P&V) strategy. A to-be-written cell is always RESET
to amorphous state ‚Äò00‚Äô and undertaken a series of SET pulse
to program the cell to the target resistance range. Writing a
MLC PCM often needs to write its resistance to a narrower
range between two reference cells, leaving a small resistance
interval as guard band.

B. PCM I-V Characteristics and Readout Metrics
Figure 2(a) shows a typical PCM I-V curve. SET and RE-
SET operations require relatively large current and voltage,
as shown in the Ô¨Ågure. Read operation usually falls in the left
below section, i.e, low Ô¨Åeld. Low Ô¨Åeld electrical resistance is
typically used to quantify the programmed cell state. A read
voltage cannot exceed the Vth as otherwise, the resistance of
the cell may drop signiÔ¨Åcantly, resulting threshold switching
phenomenon and may disturb cell state [23].
Figure 2(b) plots the low Ô¨Åeld I-V characteristic of MLC
PCM cells when they have different amount of amorphous
material (UA represents material thickness). The larger the
UA is, the higher resistance the cell has.

1) R-metric: A Current based Readout Metric: To readout
the data stored in a MLC cell, we conventionally use
current sensing to compare the resistance of the cell to the
reference cell. By applying a small voltage Vbias to MLC
cells, the read circuit compares the sensed currents with
reference currents and determine the stored values based
on the comparison results [16]. This is referred to as R-
metric based sensing, or R-sensing, as it tests the resistance
characteristic of a cell.
Recent studies [23], [7] showed that R-metric is a strong
function of the activation energy, which is the fundamental
material characteristic that change over time, and leads to
temporal resistance drift [15], i.e., the resistance of a MLC
cell, in particular if the cell was programmed to a middle
state, increases over time. For the example in Figure 1, if the
resistance of a cell in ‚Äò01‚Äô state drifts above the resistance
of Ref3, it is readout as ‚Äò00‚Äô, leading to drift errors.
It is also evident that R-metric has a very low signal-to-
noise ratio at high resistance level, making the high resis-
tance cell difÔ¨Åcult to be sensed. As shown in Figure 2(b),
the current differences under Vbias is difÔ¨Åcult to be sensed.
R-metric resistance drift can be modeled by Equation 1
[6], [8]:
R(t) = R0(t/t0)Œ±R
(1)
where R0 denotes the initial resistance at time t0, R(t)
time t,and Œ± is the drift
denotes the cell resistance at
204
coefÔ¨Åcient. Due to process variation, R0 for a given state is
subject to normal distribution of N (ŒºR, œÉ2
R). Ideally, a de-
sired programmed resistance range is within 10ŒºR¬±2.75œÉR Œ©,
while the boundary of a given state are 10ŒºR¬±3œÉR Œ©. That
is, each state has 10ŒºR¬±0.25œÉR Œ© guard band towards its left
and right states, respectively. The value of drift coefÔ¨Åcient is

Writing MLC cells into narrower resistance subranges
enlarges inter-state guard-bands such that it takes longer
time to drift into errors. This mitigation approach demands
precise writing control that takes more write iterations and
longer write latency to Ô¨Ånish write operations [34]. It is an
orthogonal approach to the schemes that are designed and
compared in this paper.
2) M-metric: A Drift-Tolerant Voltage based Readout
Metric: Alternatively, M-metric
[23] was proposed for
MLC PCM cells. By applying a bias current to MLC cells,
M-metric based sensing, or M-sensing tests the voltage
difference of cells storing different data.
Being a weak function of the activation energy, voltage
sensing shows signiÔ¨Åcant tolerance to resistance drift ‚Äî
the drift coefÔ¨Åcient for M-metric is 6-8x lower than R-
metric [23], [1]. Also, the signal range is higher as shown
in Figure 2(b). Cells at different resistance states produces
easy-to-differentiate voltage values.
Ideally, the readout operation for M-metric is performed
by current biasing and voltage sensing. By applying a bias
current Iref lower than the threshold current, the voltage
difference of different cells are sensed [23]. A major draw-
back of voltage sensing is its long sensing latency. A naive
implementation often needs more than 1000ns to Ô¨Ånish read
operation [1]. Therefore, recently, [16], [1], [14] optimized
the sensing circuit, which improves the read latency in the
range of 450ns and makes M-metric sensing practical. In
this paper, we use M-sensing to refer to this optimized
implementation of voltage sensing.
M-metric and R-metric are both cell metrics that can
be derived from I-V curve, and M-metric is more resis-
tance drift tolerant. The drift behavior of M-metric was
approximated as similar empirical model as R-metric [23].
Equation 2 and Table II shows the M-metric drift model and
conÔ¨Åguration adopted in this paper. We assume the initial
distribution of M-metric is similar to R-metric, log10M is
subject to normal distribution, with ŒºM = ŒºR ‚àí 4, meaning
the value of M-metric is 4 orders smaller than R-metric [23].
The drift-coefÔ¨Åcient is set to 1/7 of the R-metric as suggested
in [1].

III. THE DESIGN DETAILS
In this section, we Ô¨Årst motivate our design by studying
the state-of-the-art mitigation schemes. We then elaborate
the design details and evaluate the architectural overhead.
A. Motivation
The soft error rate (SER) is an important metric to
evaluate the reliability of the memory system in modern
computers. The soft errors of DRAM come mainly from
particle strikes. Recent studies on DRAM SER shows a
wide range from 25‚àº50 FIT [29] to 25,000‚àº75,000 FIT
[28] (failures in time per billion hours) per Mbit, depending
on the settings of the systems. In this paper, we choose a
small FIT value, i.e., 25 FIT per Mbit. The smaller value
the FIT is, the higher reliability the memory system has.
Given that the soft errors of MLC PCM come mainly from
drift errors [33], the design goal of this work is to mitigate
resistance drift such that, at any given time, the reliability of
MLC PCM chip can match that of DRAM chip, i.e., 25FIT
for DRAM reliability SER. For a 64B MLC PCM line that
contains 512 bits, this SER is translated to line error rate
(LER), 3.56E-15 per line-second and 1.28E-11 per line-hour,
respectively.
Our design is based on efÔ¨Åcient scrubbing [2]. More
formally,
DeÔ¨Ånition An (E, S, W) efÔ¨Åcient scrubbing is a scheme
that attaches a BCH-E code to each MLC PCM line to
correct all E or fewer errors. It scrubs each memory line in
every S seconds, and rewrites all cells of the line if detecting
W or more drifted errors.
In order to meet the reliability of DRAM in an efÔ¨Åcient
scrubbing design, we need to choose (E, S, W) such that:
(i) the probability of a memory line accumulating more
than E drift errors in the Ô¨Årst S-second interval after its
write, is smaller than LERDRAM;
