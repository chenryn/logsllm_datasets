Figure 1. COTRIN Ontology for the Travel Industry
Our research includes the development of a comprehensive and precise reference ontology named
COTRIN (Comprehensive Ontology for the Travel Industry), from XML-based OTA specifications, using
the Web Ontology Language (OWL 2004) designed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Our
investigation and objective is illustrated in Figure 1.
This ontology can be use it to bring together autonomous and heterogeneous Web services, Web
processes, applications, data, and components residing in distributed environments. Semantic Web processes,
managing dynamic package determine which Web services are used, what combinations of Web services are
allowed or required and specific rules determine how the final retail price is computed (Cardoso, Miller et al.
2004).
2.5 Dynamic Travel Packaging and Quality of Service
In semantic Web processes for dynamic travel packages, suppliers and customers define a binding agreement
between the two parties, specifying Quality of Service (QoS) items such as services to be delivered,
deadlines, and cost of services (Cardoso and Sheth 2002). The management of QoS metrics of semantic Web
processes directly impacts the success of organizations participating in e-commerce. Therefore, when
services or products are created or managed using Web processes, the underlying WfMS must accept the
specifications and be able to estimate, monitor, and control the QoS rendered to customers. Appropriate
control of quality leads to the creation of quality products and services; these, in turn, fulfill customer
expectations and achieve customer satisfaction.
We already have developed a comprehensive QoS model that allows the description of Web processes
components from a QoS perspective (Cardoso, Miller et al. 2004); it includes three dimensions: time, cost,
and reliability. The model is predictive; based on the QoS of Web process components (Web services); the
QoS of Web processes can be automatically computed. We have also presented a mathematical model that
formally describes the formulae to compute QoS metrics among Web services. Based on these formulae, we
have developed the SWR algorithm (Cardoso 2002) to automatically compute the overall QoS of Web
processes.
2.6 Impact of our Research
Results from our research will lead to the spearhead and foster the cross-industry consensus needed to
establish and maintain the most effective and widely used specifications designed to electronically exchange
business data and information among all sectors of the travel industry using ontologies.
Our research has a direct impact on the Portuguese tourism industry, as well as the worldwide tourism
industry. Portugal is well known for its tourism. In fact, in 2002 alone, this market has generated revenue of
more than $7200 millions (INE 2004).
The deployment of ontologies, semantic Web services, and semantic Web processes for the tourism
industry will enable the construction of sophisticated infrastructures to support e-commerce and e-business
activities. These ontologies encourage the development of interoperable systems that can help create and
support new collections of travel Web services to better meet the demands and expectations of travelers
through dynamic packaging. The main sectors of the industry affected include airlines, car rental agencies,
hotel corporations, leisure suppliers, tour operators, railways, ferry operators, cruise operators and any other
area of travel and tourism.
3. RELATED WORK
Economics were the first to analyze the concept of packaging/bundling (Stigler 1963; Adams and Yellen
1976). It has long recognized that packaging enables savings transaction costs. With low product information
access cost, buyers can take advantage of the benefits of travel packaging by performing dynamic
composition of Web processes made of services Web services from multiple companies offering
heterogeneous products and services (Chang, Li et al. 2003). Chircu et al. (2001) propose an analysis
framework to be used in the context of Internet-based corporate travel reservation systems to suggest a
number of recommendations for managers. The framework allows significant cost savings have created
interest among travel managers in Internet-based booking systems
Other researchers have also identified the need for the development of semantic Web processes for e-
commerce applications (SWSWPC 2004). A good example is the OWL-S specification (OWL 2004; OWL-S
2004), which semantically describes business processes. The use of semantic information facilitates process
interoperability between trading partners involved in e-commerce activities.
While a significant amount of QoS research has been done in the areas of networking, real-time
applications and middleware, the work found in the literature on quality of service for Web processes is
limited. The Crossflow project (Klingemann, Wäsch et al. 1999; Damen, Derks et al. 2000; Grefen, Aberer et
al. 2000) has made a major contribution. In their approach, the information about past process executions is
collected in a log and used to subsequently calculate the time and the cost associated with process executions.
While the research on QoS for WfMS is limited, the research on time management, which is under the
umbrella of workflow QoS, has been more active and productive. A significant amount of work can be found
in (Pozewaunig, Eder et al. 1997; Reichert and Dadam 1998; Eder, Panagos et al. 1999; Marjanovic and
Orlowska 1999; Bauer and Dadam 2000; Gillmann, Weissenfels et al. 2000; Gillmann, Weikum et al. 2002).
4. CONCLUSION
The Web has permanently changed the manner vacation packages can be created. Consumers can now
acquire packages from a diversity of Web sites including online agencies and airlines. With the spread of
Web travel, a new technology has surfaced for the leisure travel industry: dynamic travel packaging.
This new trend in the travel industry requires the ability to dynamically compose travel packages from the
aggregation and orchestration of distributed Web services. With the growth of demand for customized travel
itineraries, agencies seek technology that provides their clients the flexibility to build unique packages from a
selection of choices. Dynamic packages can be created and booked effortlessly with private and published
air, car hire, hotels, attractions and insurance rates.
Current approaches using XML-based specification messages (such as OTA specifications) are not
sufficient to enable the creation of dynamic travel packages. One solution is the use of ontologies to
overcome semantic problems that arise from the autonomy, heterogeneity, and distribution of Web services.
Our research targets the development of a comprehensive and functional ontology relating the terms
commonly used by the tourism industry when exchanging data and information to deploy and manage Web
processes to dynamically compose travel packages. This cannot be successful without the implementation of
methods and algorithms to compute the QoS of the semantic Web processes developed.
