User: Please describe in detail the working principle of DNS (Domain Name System) and how to troubleshoot DNS resolution failures.
Assistant: DNS (Domain Name System) is a system that converts domain names into IP addresses. It converts easy-to-remember domain names into IP addresses and other related information so that computers and other network devices can communicate with each other. The working principle of DNS is as follows: 1. When the user enters a domain name in the browser, the browser will send a query request to the local DNS server. 2. If the local DNS server has a cache record for the domain name, return the cached IP address to the browser. 3. If the local DNS server has no cache record, query the address of the domain name server through the root domain name server. 4. The root domain name server returns the address of the domain name server to the local DNS server. 5. The local DNS server sends a query request to the domain name server and gets a response. 6. The local DNS server caches the response in its own server and returns the IP address to the browser. 7. The browser uses the IP address to establish a connection with the server to obtain the required web content. If a DNS resolution failure occurs, follow the steps below to troubleshoot: 1. Check whether the DNS settings of the browser are correct, and try to restart the browser. 2. Confirm whether the network connection between the computer and the router is normal, and try to connect the computer to another network. 3. Check the cache records of the local DNS server and try to clear the cache. 4. Use command-line tools such as nslookup or dig to query the IP address of a specific domain name on the local DNS server. This command can diagnose DNS failures and check whether the DNS server returns the IP address correctly. 5. If the above steps fail, you may need to contact your network provider or system administrator for help.
