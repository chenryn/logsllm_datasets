I am new to using the Raspberry Pi and Python. After gathering information from several forum posts, I determined that the following commands, when executed in the LXTerminal window while running Raspbian, successfully set up a small screen:

```bash
sudo modprobe spi-bcm2708
sudo modprobe fbtft_device name=adafruitts rotate=90
export FRAMEBUFFER=/dev/fb1
startx
```

To automate this process, I thought it would be best to run a Python script from the `/etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart` configuration file. However, I am unsure how to write the Python script to automatically open an LXTerminal window and execute these commands.

Could you provide guidance on how to achieve this? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

**Response:**

Instead of trying to open a terminal window from a Python script, you can use the `os.system()` function to run the commands directly. Here is an example of how you could do this in Python:

```python
import os

os.system("sudo modprobe spi-bcm2708")
os.system("sudo modprobe fbtft_device name=adafruitts rotate=90")
os.system("export FRAMEBUFFER=/dev/fb1")
os.system("startx")
```

However, a more straightforward approach would be to create a Bash script containing these commands. For example, create a file named `setup_screen.sh` with the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
sudo modprobe spi-bcm2708
sudo modprobe fbtft_device name=adafruitts rotate=90
export FRAMEBUFFER=/dev/fb1
startx
```

Make the script executable with:

```bash
chmod +x setup_screen.sh
```

Then, you can add the following line to the `/etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart` file to run the script at startup:

```bash
@/path/to/your/setup_screen.sh
```

Alternatively, to avoid entering the `sudo` password, you can add the commands (without `sudo`) to the `/etc/rc.local` file, just before the `exit 0` line:

```bash
modprobe spi-bcm2708
modprobe fbtft_device name=adafruitts rotate=90
export FRAMEBUFFER=/dev/fb1
startx
```

This will ensure the commands are executed during the system boot process.
