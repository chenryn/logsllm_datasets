### Resolving Error 550 4.4.7: "One sender is not able to send us e-mail from external domain"

**Error Message:**
```
550 4.4.7 queue.expired; message.expired
```

**Explanation:**

The SMTP Extended Error `4.4.7` indicates a persistent transient failure, specifically related to network and routing status, with the sub-code `7` indicating that the delivery time has expired.

This error typically occurs when an email is held at an intermediate relay server for an extended period because it cannot connect to the next server in the delivery chain. This could be due to:

1. **ISP's Relay Server:** The ISP's relay server is unable to deliver the message to the end-user server.
2. **Corporate Edge Server:** A corporate edge server is unable to deliver the message to the final mailbox store server.

In your case, it appears that the sender's mail server (or their ISP's relay mail server) is unable to connect to your mail server to deliver the message. One common cause of this issue is an improperly configured firewall, particularly one that drops packets to or from certain IP addresses (bogons).

**Steps to Resolve:**

1. **Check Firewall Configuration:**
   - Ask the sender to check their firewall logs at the time they are trying to send the message to you. Look for any dropped packets or connection attempts that were blocked.
   - Ensure that the firewall is not configured to drop packets to or from bogons (IP addresses that should not exist).

2. **Review Network Connectivity:**
   - Verify that there are no network issues between the sender's mail server and your mail server.
   - Check for any network outages or routing problems that might be causing the delay.

3. **Examine Email Headers:**
   - Review the `Received:` headers in the non-delivery report (NDR) to trace the path of the email and identify where the delay is occurring.

4. **Contact Your ISP:**
   - If the issue persists, contact your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to ensure that there are no known issues on their end that could be causing the problem.

5. **Adjust Timeout Settings:**
   - If the delay is due to a legitimate but slow connection, consider adjusting the timeout settings on your mail server to allow for longer delivery times.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue causing the `550 4.4.7` error. If the problem continues, further investigation into the specific configurations and logs of both the sender's and recipient's mail servers may be necessary.

If you need more assistance, please provide additional details such as the `Received:` headers from the NDR, and I can help you further.
