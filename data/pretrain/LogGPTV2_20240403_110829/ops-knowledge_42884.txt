User: How to monitor containerized deployed applications using common monitoring tools such as Prometheus?
Assistant: Here are some steps to monitor a containerized application with Prometheus: 1. Configure the Prometheus server. A Prometheus server can be deployed locally or on the cloud. 2. Enable the deployment storage plugin in Prometheus. This enables Prometheus to obtain detailed information about containerized applications. 3. Configure Prometheus to monitor containerized applications. You can use Prometheus's yaml file to define monitoring rules. 4. Generate metrics based on the containerized application. Prometheus can generate metrics from specified locations in the application code and expose those metrics on the Prometheus server. 5. Use the Prometheus query language to retrieve metrics data. 6. In order to better visualize the data, Grafana can be integrated with the Prometheus service. 7. Create a dashboard in Grafana to display the status of the containerized application. In general, Prometheus and related monitoring tools can help to continuously monitor applications deployed on containers and quickly find and solve problems.
