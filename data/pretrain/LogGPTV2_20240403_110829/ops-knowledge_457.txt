User: How to implement secure remote access using the SSH protocol? Please provide an SSH configuration scheme.
Assistant: Step 1: Install the SSH server 1. Log in to the Linux system as the root user, and execute the following command to install the SSH server: sudo apt-get install openssh-server Step 2: Configure the SSH server 1. Open the SSH configuration file: sudo vi /etc /ssh/sshd_config Note: Other editors can be used instead of vi. 2. Modify the following configuration items: Change the port number to other unused ports (such as: 2222) to prevent attacks. Port 2222 disables password login and only allows public key authentication: PasswordAuthentication no Set PubkeyAuthentication to yes to enable public key authentication. PubkeyAuthentication yes allows root users to log in: PermitRootLogin yes allows users to access specific directories: Subsystem sftp internal-sftp Match User test ChrootDirectory /home/test/ftp ForceCommand internal-sftp Adjustment. 3. Save the configuration file and exit. 4. Restart the SSH service: sudo systemctl restart ssh Step 3: Generate an SSH key 1. Use the following command to generate an SSH key: ssh-keygen -t rsa 2. Enter the file save path and password as prompted. 3. The generated SSH key file is in the .ssh directory under the user's home directory. Step 4: Remote access 1. Use the SSH client on the local machine to log in to the remote host: ssh -p 2222 user@remote_host Note: 2222 is an unused port set in the configuration file, and user is an existing user on the remote host. 2. When logging in, the SSH client will automatically read the SSH key in the .ssh directory under the user's home directory, and the authentication can be completed without entering the password again. 3. After successfully logging in, you can execute commands on the remote host.
