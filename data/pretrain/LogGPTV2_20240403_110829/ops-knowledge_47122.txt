User: Which linux distro is better suited for Python web development?
Background:
I currently develop on Windows and it's fine, but I am looking to move my core Python development to Linux. I'm sure most any distro will work fine, but does anyone have any reasons to believe one distro is better than another?
Assistant: As the other answers have mentioned so far, the Python 2.6 interpreter will be available on all recent Linux distribution releases. That shouldn't influence your choice.
However, your choice of IDE may eliminate some possibilities. You should make sure the distribution you select has a package for the latest version of your IDE, and that it is updated often enough.
As an example, I like to use Eclipse with PyDev for developing Python apps in either OS, but Ubuntu's official repositories had only Eclipse 3.2 (from 2006) until October of last year, when they finally updated to 3.5 in the latest distribution.
