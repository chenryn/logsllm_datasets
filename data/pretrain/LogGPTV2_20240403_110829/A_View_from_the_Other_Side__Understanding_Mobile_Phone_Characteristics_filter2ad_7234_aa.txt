## Abstract
Mobile devices are increasingly prevalent in the developing world. However, there is limited insight into the characteristics of these devices. Using a dataset of approximately 0.5 million subscribers from one of the largest cellular operators in Pakistan, we analyze the features of mobile phones (e.g., CPU, memory, and cellular interface). We identify potential device-level bottlenecks for Internet access and examine the security implications. To facilitate this analysis, we propose abstractions (e.g., connectivity, capacity, and device security) and cluster phones based on these abstractions. Our findings reveal valuable insights for improving mobile web performance.

## 1. Introduction
Mobile devices are becoming increasingly common in developing regions. According to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), mobile-broadband subscriptions reached 2.3 billion by the end of 2014, with 55% of them in developing countries [19]. These devices are used for various services, including agricultural information dissemination, education, and healthcare delivery [23, 33].

While the Internet infrastructure in developing regions has been steadily improving, and initiatives like Google’s Project Loon [15] and Facebook’s Connectivity Lab [3] focus on providing Internet connectivity via satellites, balloons, drones, and planes, anecdotal evidence suggests that the use of low-end devices with slow Internet connections can lead to poor user experiences [6]. Recent studies have explored the issue of poor application performance from various angles, such as core infrastructural issues and geographical locations [31, 37]. For example, studies have found that the lack of good caching infrastructure and DNS servers are primary causes of poor performance [21, 37], while others have highlighted CDN server placements and routing protocols as key performance issues [32].

However, there is limited information available about the characteristics of devices used in developing countries and their impact on Internet access. This paper presents an in-depth study of mobile phones from one of the largest cellular providers in Pakistan. Using a dataset of approximately 0.5 million subscribers, we:
1. Present a taxonomy of mobile phones based on different features (e.g., CPU, memory, OS type, and WiFi support).
2. Discuss the implications of mobile phone characteristics (e.g., maximum data rates, browser support, and security vulnerabilities) for Internet access and identify potential performance bottlenecks.
3. Propose abstractions for classifying phones along different axes (e.g., connectivity, capacity, and flexibility).

Unlike prior works that focus on the adoption and usage of smartphones [27], our unique focus on individual device features reveals new insights, showing how mobile devices might be a major bottleneck to Internet access. This can inform various stakeholders (e.g., content providers and Internet service providers) in improving mobile web performance. We believe this study provides a missing piece of the puzzle to understand Internet access in developing regions.

### Key Observations
- **Data Rates:** 66% of the mobile phones support only GSM (52%) and GPRS (14%), limiting their data rates to no more than 40 kbps. Only 11.2% of the phones had HSDPA (a.k.a. 3G/3G+) or LTE capabilities.
- **CPU and Memory:** Approximately 30% of the mobile phones have CPU speeds of less than 500 MHz. The distribution of memory sizes is heavy-tailed, with most phones (57%) having less than 10 MB of memory and a small fraction (0.48%) having more than 1 GB of RAM. Such configurations often lead to poor performance for web browsing and multimedia applications [31, 34].
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** 58.1% of the phones being used have been discontinued by vendors, making them vulnerable to known security attacks. Android and Symbian were the most popular mobile operating systems, with Android 2.3, 4.0, and 4.1 being the most widely used versions, all of which have well-known security vulnerabilities [4, 14].
- **Browser Support:** A significant fraction of phones (49.5%) support only WAP browsers, which do not support JavaScript and provide a stripped-down version of XHTML. This limits the functionality and user experience of web-based applications.

These findings suggest that device-level bottlenecks are common in developing regions and should be considered when designing services for users in such areas. For example, specialized web proxies that preprocess websites to perform memory-intensive computations could benefit phones with high CPU speeds but small memory sizes.

Our work highlights that simply changing the cellular network technology is insufficient; changes must also account for device limitations. This reinforces the importance of research focused on building low-cost data communication channels (e.g., using SMS or voice as the transport mechanism) [25], developing specialized proxies for developing countries [35], and designing applications suited for low-end feature phones [16, 28, 30]. For instance, Polly [30], a viral telephone-based system, aims to reach low-literate populations through a voice-based game.

### Summary of Contributions
- **Data-Driven Study:** We present a data-driven study of the characteristics of mobile devices in a developing country, building a custom cell phone database containing 19 features (§2).
- **Security Analysis:** We analyze the security implications of the mobile phones being used, identify potential device-level bottlenecks, and discuss their impact on Internet access in a developing area like Pakistan (§3).
- **WAP Browser Characterization:** We develop a tool to characterize website support for WAP browsers. Using this tool, we survey the top 300 websites in Pakistan and find that while 25% of websites provide a significantly smaller version for WAP browsers, only 6% are truly WAP compliant (i.e., no JavaScript or rich content) (§4).
- **Abstractions and Clustering:** We propose abstractions (e.g., connectivity, capacity, flexibility, and device security) and cluster phones based on these abstractions, revealing interesting insights for improving mobile web performance (§5).

## 2. Dataset
Our dataset comprises twelve months (January 2014 – December 2014) of anonymized Call Detail Records (CDR) for the Jhelum district from one of the largest cellular operators in Pakistan. The Jhelum district has an area of approximately 3,500 km² and a 2013 population estimate of around 1.2 million. The dataset contains information about approximately 0.5 million unique subscribers and the mobile devices they used. Since 3G and 4G services were launched in Pakistan in April 2014, we present an analysis for the month of December 2014 to capture the latest set of mobile phones being used.

We use the available device information (i.e., cell phone name and model) to construct a cell phone database by fetching information from online sources [8, 10]. Our dataset contains 19 cell phone features, including information about the supported cellular interface (e.g., GPRS, EDGE, HSPDA, and LTE), WiFi interface (e.g., 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n), CPU speed, amount of memory, operating system (OS), phone status (i.e., continued/discontinued), camera, GPS, email, and browser support. Figure 1a shows the fraction of cell phones for which information was available for different features. For example, our database had information about the browser used in 77.3% of the cell phones. Our dataset contains approximately 4,000 unique cell phone models. Figure 1b shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the number of phones for each phone model. Approximately 80% of the phone models have fewer than 200 phones, while only about 5% of the phone models have at least 5,000 phones each.

## 3. Taxonomy
In this section, we present a taxonomy of mobile phones in our dataset based on various features, including cellular/WiFi interfaces, CPU speed and RAM capacity, OS type and phone status, and browser support.

### 3.1 Cellular/WiFi Interfaces
#### Cellular Interface
We classify phones based on the cellular technology they support. As shown in Figure 2, 52% of the phones support only GSM. GPRS and EDGE are fairly common, together making up 36.8% of the phones. HSDPA and LTE make up 11.2% of all the phones in our dataset.

Table 1 shows the typical downlink data rates supported by these technologies. Given that most phones only support GSM, their achievable data rate is upper-bounded by 9.6 kbps [12], which is too low for supporting most popular data services and applications. Approximately 66% of the phones (i.e., GSM and GPRS combined) can expect to achieve no more than 40 kbps of data rates (which is a typical data rate offered by GPRS [13]). Together with EDGE, 88.4% of the phones can expect no more than 236 kbps of data rates [3].

| Data Rates (kbits/s) | Cellular Technology |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| 9.6                  | GSM [12]            |
| 40-171               | GPRS [7, 13]        |
| 120-384              | EDGE [5]            |
| 600-13400            | HSDPA [9]           |
| 3000-36000 (max: 300 Mbps) | LTE [11, 18] |

#### Cellular Technologies Across Cell Phone Models
We also study the distribution of cellular technologies across the different cell phone models (approximately 4,000) in our dataset. As shown in Figure 2b, only 13.6% of the phone models in our dataset had GSM support, but they made up 52% of the phones. Approximately 29% of the phone models supported HSDPA (a.k.a. 3G+), but these represented only 10.6% of the phones in our dataset. A possible reason for this discrepancy is the widespread use of older, lower-cost phones in the region.
