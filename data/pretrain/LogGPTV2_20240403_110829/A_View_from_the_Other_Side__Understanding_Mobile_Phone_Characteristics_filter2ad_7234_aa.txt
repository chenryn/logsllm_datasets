ABSTRACT
Mobile devices are becoming increasingly dominant in the
developing world. However, there is little insight into the
characteristics of devices being used in such regions. Us-
ing a dataset of ∼0.5 million subscribers from one of the
largest cellular operators in Pakistan, we analyze the char-
acteristics of cell phones based on different features (e.g.,
CPU, memory, and cellular interface). We identify potential
device-level bottlenecks for Internet access and analyze the
security implications of the phones being used. To aid the
analysis of cell phones, we propose abstractions (e.g., con-
nectivity, capacity, and device security) and cluster phones
based on these abstractions. Our analysis reveals interesting
insights for improving mobile web performance.

Mobile devices are becoming increasingly common in devel-
oping regions. The International Telecommunication Union
(ITU) reported that mobile-broadband subscriptions reached
2.3 billion by the end of 2014, with 55% of them in devel-
oping countries [19]. Mobile devices are being used for a
variety of services in such countries including agricultural
information dissemination, education, and health care deliv-
ery [23, 33].
Introduction
While the Internet infrastructure has been steadily improv-
ing in developing regions and several efforts (e.g., Google’s
Project Loon [15] and Facebook’s Connectivity Lab [3]) fo-
cus on providing Internet connectivity via satellites, balloons,
drones, and planes, anecdotal evidence suggests that the com-
mon use of low end devices with a slow Internet connection

can lead to poor user experience in developing regions [6].
Recent studies have explored the issue of poor application
performance from a variety of angles, ranging from core in-
frastructural issues to geographical locations [31, 37]. For
example, recent studies found that the lack of good caching
infrastructure and DNS servers are the primary causes of
poor performance [21, 37]. Another related study has shown
CDN server placements and routing protocols as primary
performance issues [32].
However, there is very little information available about
the characteristics of devices being used in developing coun-
tries and how they may impact Internet access. This paper
presents an in-depth study of cell phones from one of the
largest cellular providers in Pakistan. Using a dataset of
∼0.5 million subscribers, we, (a) present a taxonomy of cell
phones based on different features (e.g., CPU, memory, OS
type, and WiFi support), (b) discuss the implications of cell
phone characteristics (e.g., maximum data rates, user expe-
rience due to browser support, and security vulnerabilities)
for Internet access and identify potential performance bot-
tlenecks, and (c) propose abstractions for classifying phones
along different axes (e.g., connectivity, capacity, and ﬂexi-
bility).
Unlike prior works (e.g., [27]) that study the adoption and
usage of smart phones, our unique focus on the individual
features of cell phones reveals new insights, showing how
mobile devices might be a major bottleneck to Internet ac-
cess. This in turn can inform various stakeholders (e.g., con-
tent providers and Internet service providers) in improving
mobile web performance. We believe this study provides a
missing piece of the puzzle to understand Internet access in
developing regions.
We make the following observations:
• We ﬁnd that 66% of the cell phones support only GSM
(52%) and GPRS (14%), thus they can expect to achieve
no more than 40 kbps of data rates1. On the other hand,
only 11.2% of the cell phones had HSDPA (a.k.a. 3G/3G+)
or LTE capable handsets.
• We ﬁnd that ∼30% cell phones have CPU speeds of less
than 500 MHz. The distribution of memory sizes was found

319to be heavy tailed with most phones (57%) having less
than 10 MB of memory and a small fraction (0.48%) hav-
ing more than 1 GB of RAM. Such phones can often lead
to poor performance for web browsing and web-based mul-
timedia applications [31, 34].
• Our study shows that 58.1% of the phones being used have
actually been discontinued by the vendors. As such, these
phones may be vulnerable to well-known security attacks.
Although, most phones use vendor-speciﬁc operating sys-
tems, Android and Symbian were the most popular mo-
bile operating systems. Android 2.3, 4.0, and 4.1 were the
most widely used versions, all with well-known security
vulnerabilities [4, 14].
• We ﬁnd that a signiﬁcant fraction of phones (49.5%) in our
dataset support only wireless application protocol (WAP)
browsers. Unlike modern web browsers (e.g., Safari or
Chrome), a WAP browser only supports a stripped down
version of XHTML and uses the WAP protocol for access-
ing the Internet. However, it does not support JavaScript.
These ﬁndings suggest that device-level bottlenecks may
be common in developing regions and should be taken into
consideration when designing services for users in such re-
gions. These insights can inform content providers, service
providers, and even vendors on improving access to services.
For example, we ﬁnd that although CPU speeds are high in
several phones, they are equipped with very small memory
sizes. Such phones can beneﬁt by having specialised web
proxies that preprocess websites performing memory inten-
sive computations.
Our work highlights the fact that simply changing the cel-
lular network technology is insufﬁcient, changes in the net-
work must be aware of device limitations. To this end, our
work reinforces the importance of developing regions re-
search that deals with building low cost data communication
channels (e.g., using SMS or voice as the transport mecha-
nism) [25], building specialized proxies for developing coun-
tries [35], and designing applications suited for low-end fea-
ture phones [16, 28, 30]. In particular, using data channels
over SMS/voice can enable or augment existing low data rate
services (e.g., GSM and GPRS) to further improve the actual
data rates. Moreover, non-data channels (e.g., voice) can
also be directly used for building social networking, educa-
tion, and health care applications. For example, Polly [30],
a viral telephone-based system aims to reach low-literate
population for development related services through a voice-
based game.
In summary, this paper makes the following key contribu-
tions:
• We present a data-driven study of the characteristics of
mobile devices in a developing country. Towards this end,
we build a custom cell phone database containing 19 cell
phone features (§2).
• We analyze the security implications of the cell phones
being used, identify potential device-level bottlenecks and

discuss how they may impact Internet access in a develop-
ing area like Pakistan (§3).
• We develop a tool to characterize website support for WAP
browsers. Using this tool, we survey the top 300 websites
in Pakistan and found that while 25% of websites pro-
vide a signiﬁcantly smaller version of their site for WAP
browsers, only 6% are truly WAP compliant (i.e., no JavaScript
or rich content) (§4).
• To aid the analysis of cell phones, we propose abstractions
(e.g., connectivity, capacity, ﬂexibility, and device secu-
rity) and cluster phones based on these abstractions. Our
analysis reveals interesting insights for improving mobile
web performance (§5).
2 Dataset
Our dataset comprises twelve months (Jan 2014 – Dec 2014)
of anonymized Call Detail Records (CDR) for district Jhelum
from one of the largest cellular operators in Pakistan. The
Jhelum district has an area of approximately 3,500 km2, and
a 2013 population estimate of ∼1.2 million. The dataset con-
tains information about ∼0.5 million unique subscribers and
the mobile devices they used. As 3G and 4G services were
launched in Pakistan in April, 2014, we present analysis only
for the month of December, 2014 to capture the latest set of
cell phones being used.
We use the available device information (i.e., cell phone
name and model) to construct a cell phone database by fetch-
ing information from online sources [8, 10]. Our dataset
contains 19 cell phone features including information about
the cellular interface supported (e.g., GPRS, EDGE, HSPDA,
and LTE), WiFi interface (e.g., 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n),
CPU speed, amount of memory, operating system (OS), phone
status (i.e., continued/discontinued), camera, and GPS, email,
and browser support. Figure 1a shows the fraction of cell
phones as a function of different features whose information
was available to us2. For example, our database had infor-
mation about the browser used in 77.3% of the cell phones.
Our dataset contains ∼4000 unique cell phone models.
Figure 1b shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF)
of the number of phones having a phone model. Observe
that ∼80% of the phone models have less than 200 phones
2Due to space limitations, Figure 1a shows information for
only a subset of the features.

whereas only ∼5% of the phone models have at least 5000

3 Taxonomy
In this section, we present a taxonomy of cell phones in
our dataset based on a variety of features including cellu-
lar/WiFi interfaces, CPU speed and RAM capacity, OS type
and phone status, and browser support.
3.1 Cellular/WiFi Interfaces
Cellular Interface: We now present a classiﬁcation of phones
based on the cellular technology they support. We ﬁnd that
52% of the phones support only GSM as shown in Figure 2.
GPRS and EDGE are fairly common and together make up
36.8% of the phones. HSPDA and LTE make up 11.2% of
all the phones in our dataset.
Table 1 shows the typical downlink data rates supported
by these technologies. Given that most phones only sup-
port GSM, their achievable data rate is upper bounded by
9.6 kbps [12], which is too low for supporting most popular
data services and applications. ∼66% of the phones (i.e.,
GSM and GPRS combined) can expect to achieve no more
than 40 kbps of data rates (which is a typical data rate offered
by GPRS [13]). Together with EDGE, 88.4% of the phones
can expect no more than 236 kbps of data rates3.

Cellular technologies across cell phones models: We also
study the distribution of cellular technologies over the dif-
ferent cell phone models (∼4000) present in our dataset. We
found that only 13.6% of the phone models in our dataset
had GSM support as shown in Figure 2b but they made up
52% of the phones in our dataset. ∼29% of the phone mod-
els supported HSDPA (a.k.a. 3G+) but these represented only
10.6% of the phones in our dataset. A possible reason for
