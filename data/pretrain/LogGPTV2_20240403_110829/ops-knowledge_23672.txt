User:  How to perform basic security hardening on the server?
Assistant: The following are suggestions for basic security hardening of servers: 1. Disable unnecessary services. Only enable required services, and disable other unnecessary services. 2. Implement access controls. Control who can access your server with secure username and password combinations. 3. Install updates and patches. Regularly update the server's operating system and applications. Close unnecessary ports and services. 4. Configure the firewall. Set up a network interface or server firewall to prevent unauthorized access. 5. Enable encrypted transmission. Use encryption technologies such as SSL or TLS to increase the protection of data transmission. Prioritize the use of secure protocols such as SSH and encrypted channels. 6. Set the security policy. Use security policies to restrict user operations on the server. 7. Restrict file access permissions. Audit and restrict access to sensitive files and directories. 8. Configure log monitoring. Enable security logs and monitor application and system activity to spot and fix security breaches as they arise. 9. Make regular backups. Back up server data regularly so that the system can be restored in case of risk.
