## [Antifascism](antifascism.md)
* New: [How to fight fascism.](antifascism.md#how-to-fight-fascism)
    There are many ways to fight it, the book [Todo el mundo puede ser Antifa: Manual practico para destruir el fascismo of Pol Andiñach](https://www.txalaparta.eus/es/libros/todo-el-mundo-puede-ser-antifa) gathers some of them.
    One way we've seen pisses them off quite much is when they are ridiculed and
    they evocate the image of incompetence. It's a fine line to go, because if it
    falls into a pity image then it may strengthen their victim role.

## Languages
### [Configure Docker to host the application](docker.md)
* New: [Update dockers with Renovate.](docker.md#with-renovate)
    [Renovate](renovate.md) is a program that does automated
    dependency updates. Multi-platform and multi-language.
* New: [Connect multiple docker compose files.](docker.md#connect-multiple-docker-compose-files)
    You can connect services defined across multiple docker-compose.yml files.
    In order to do this you’ll need to:
    * Create an external network with `docker network create `
    * In each of your `docker-compose.yml` configure the default network to use your
        externally created network with the networks top-level key.
    * You can use either the service name or container name to connect between containers.
### [Python Snippets](python_snippets.md)
* New: [Print datetime with a defined format.](python_snippets.md#print-datetime-with-a-defined-format)
    ```python
    now = datetime.now()
    today.strftime('We are the %d, %b %Y')
    ```
    Where the datetime format is a string built from [these directives](#parse-a-datetime-from-a-string).
* New: [Print string with asciiart.](python_snippets.md#print-string-with-asciiart)
    ```bash
    pip install pyfiglet
    ```
    ```python
    from pyfiglet import figlet_format
    print(figlet_format('09 : 30'))
    ```
    If you want to change the default width of 80 caracteres use:
    ```python
    from pyfiglet import Figlet
    f = Figlet(font="standard", width=100)
    print(f.renderText("aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"))
    ```
* New: [Print specific time format.](python_snippets.md#print-specific-time-format)
    ```python
    datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S')
    ```

### [ICS](ics.md)
* New: Introduce ICS.
    [ics](https://icspy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) is a pythonic iCalendar
    library. Its goals are to read and write ics data in
    a developer-friendly way.
### [rich](rich.md)

            live.update(f"Test {row}")
            time.sleep(0.4)
    ```
    If you don't want the text to have the default colors, you can embed it all in
    a `Text` object.
# DevOps
## Infrastructure as Code
### [Gitea](gitea.md)
* New: Introduce gitea.
    [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/) is a community managed lightweight code hosting
    solution written in Go. It's the best self hosted Github alternative in my
    opinion.
## Automating Processes
### [renovate](renovate.md)
* New: Introduce Renovate.
    [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/) is a program that does automated
    dependency updates. Multi-platform and multi-language.
    Why use Renovate?
    * Get pull requests to update your dependencies and lock files.
    * Reduce noise by scheduling when Renovate creates PRs.
    * Renovate finds relevant package files automatically, including in monorepos.
    * You can customize the bot's behavior with configuration files.
    * Share your configuration with ESLint-like config presets.
    * Get replacement PRs to migrate from a deprecated dependency to the community
        suggested replacement (npm packages only).
    * Open source.
    * Popular (more than 9.7k stars and 1.3k forks)
    * Beautifully integrate with main Git web applications (Gitea, Gitlab, Github).
    * It supports most important languages: Python, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform,
        Ansible, Node, ...
## Storage
### [NAS](nas.md)
* New: [Analyze RAM to buy.](nas.md#ram)
    Most [ZFS](zfs.md) resources suggest using ECC RAM. The provider gives me two
    options:
    * Kingston Server Premier DDR4 3200MHz 16GB CL22
    * Kingston Server Premier DDR4 2666MHz 16GB CL19
    I'll go with two modules of 3200MHz CL22 because it has a smaller [RAM
    latency](ram.md#speed).
* New: [Analyze motherboard to buy.](nas.md#motherboard)
    After reading these reviews([1](https://reviewsgarage.com/best-motherboards-for-nas/), [2](https://pcper.com/2020/03/asrock-x570m-pro4-micro-atx-motherboard-review/)) I've come to the decision to purchase the [ASRock X570M Pro4](https://www.asrock.com/MB/AMD/X570M%20Pro4/index.asp) because, It
    supports:
    * 8 x SATA3 disks
    * 2 x M.2 disks
    * 4 x DDR4 RAM slots with speeds up to 4200+ and ECC support
    * 1 x AMD AM4 Socket Ryzen™ 2000, 3000, 4000 G-Series, 5000 and 5000 G-Series
        Desktop Processors
    * Supports NVMe SSD as boot disks
    * Micro ATX Form Factor.
    And it gives me room enough to grow:
    * It supports PCI 4.0 for the M.2 which is said to be capable of perform twice
        the speed compared to previous 3rd generation. the chosen M2 are of 3rd
        generation, so if I need more speed I can change them.
    * I'm only going to use 2 slots of RAM giving me 32GB, but I could grow 32 more
        easily.
* New: [Analyze CPU to buy.](nas.md#cpu)
    After doing some [basic research](cpu.md) I'm between:
