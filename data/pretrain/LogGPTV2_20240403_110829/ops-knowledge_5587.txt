User: Python 2.7 has two different disk image installers for Mac OS X. My questions are:

What are the differences between the two Python 2.7 disk image installers?


Python 2.7 32-bit Mac OS X Installer Disk Image for Mac OS X 10.3 through 10.6
Python 2.7 PPC/i386/x86-64 Mac OS X Installer Disk Image for Mac OS X 10.5 or later

If running Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard without the 64-bit kernel and extensions, which is the more appropriate version of Python 2.7 to install?
Why are there two different Mac OS X disk image installers for Python 2.7 when Python 2.6.5 and Python 3.2 each only have one?
Does the first listed installer support PPC? Strange that it wouldn't if it support back to Mac OS X 10.3, but unlike the second installer PPC isn't listed.
Assistant: 1) You almost certainly want "Python 2.7 PPC/i386/x86-64 Mac OS X Installer Disk Image". It's also a close analogue of the 2.6.x version that comes with 10.6 by default.
2) Unless you know you need 32-bit versions for some reason, default to 64-bit for everything on Snow Leopard. It's what will most closely match the rest of the the apps/libraries/userland. The kernel is irrelevant in this regard. The 32-bit OS X kernel can and will still run 64-bit userland.
3) 64-bit versions weren't available before 10.6.
