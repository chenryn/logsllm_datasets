User: How to use Ansible for automated deployment? Please provide a configuration and usage process of Ansible, and explain the core concepts and working principles of Ansible.
Assistant: Ansible is a lightweight automation tool that can realize various functions such as automatic deployment, configuration management, and application publishing. The following is the configuration and usage process of Ansible for automated deployment. Configuration 1. Install Ansible: Install Ansible on the control node. 2. Configure SSH: Configure SSH on the controlled node. 3. Write Ansible configuration files: You can use INI format or YAML format files to configure host lists, variables, tasks, etc. 4. Create Ansible Playbook: Ansible Playbook is a set of instructions used to define the execution process of tasks. Playbooks can be written using the YAML format. Use process 1. Write Ansible Playbook: Define the execution process, variables and host list of the task. 2. Execute Ansible Playbook: Use the ansible-playbook command to execute Ansible Playbook. 3. View execution results: View the execution results to check for errors or warnings. 4. Update Ansible Playbook: Modify and update Ansible Playbook to better meet the needs. Core concepts 1. Host inventory (Inventory): Define the host list of the controlled node, which can be defined using a file in INI format or YAML format. 2. Module: A tool set for performing tasks on remote hosts, including file operations, package management, service management, etc. 3. Playbook: A file containing a list of tasks, used to define the execution process of tasks. 4. Roles: A collection of related Playbooks and variables for repeated use. How it works Ansible connects to the target host via SSH and uses the Python interpreter to execute commands on the target host. Ansible Playbook defines the execution process of tasks and uses modules to execute tasks. Ansible modules will automate many common system administration tasks such as: managing files, packages, users, services, and more. Ansible does not need to install any client software on the controlled host, and can easily realize automatic deployment and management.
