ABSTRACT
Numerous smart devices are deployed in smart grid for state
measurement, decision-making and remote control. The se-
curity issues of smart devices attract more and more at-
tention. In our work, the communication protocol, storage
mechanism and authentication of smart devices are analyzed
and a toolbox is developed to evaluate the security risks of
smart devices. In this demo, our toolbox is applied to scan
3 smart meters/power monitor systems. A potential risk list
is generated and the vulnerabilities are further veriﬁed.

INTRODUCTION
In smart grid (SG), various smart devices are deployed
into power systems to provide a desirable infrastructure for
real-time measurement, transmission, decision and control.
At the same time, numerous widely-deployed smart devices
provide the attackers a great opportunity to attack SG. Var-
ious attacks such as eavesdropping, information tampering
and malicious control command injection that have almost
ruined the Internet, would impose serious threat on secure
and stable SG operation. In our work, we found many com-
mon security risks could be easily implemented on the smart
devices.
Bad Data Injection (BDI): The attackers may inject
bad data into SG through tampering meter’s data. More-
over, the large scale BDI attack [3, 5] may lead the control

center’s making the wrong decisions and sending false com-
mands.
Privacy Leakage: The malicious users can access the
smart devices to obtain the privacy of the users. For exam-
ple, the behaviors of users and appliances could be identiﬁed
from the power load proﬁle, using nonintrusive load moni-
toring system (NILMs) [2, 4].
Cyber Attacks: In recent years, various cyber attacks
have been implemented into SG, such as smart meter worm
[1], meter botnet, DoS, fabricating authentication, Session
Hijack, and so on. In 2010, the Stuxnet worm attacked the
Iran’s Bushehr nuclear plant and damaged lots of centrifuges.
At the same time, it is a huge challenge to prevent these
security risks, because: 1) it is almost impossible to mon-
itor all smart devices, since numerous devices are widely
deployed in the SG; 2) the computation power and storage
space of most smart devices are limited to implement com-
mon security defense system.
In our work, the communication protocol, storage mech-
anism and authentication of smart devices are investigated.
Lots of vulnerabilities are found and collected, which would
cause serious attacks on smart devices, such as password
cracking, authentication bypassing, user’s privacy leak, bad
data/false command injection and so on. A toolbox is de-
veloped to evaluate the security risks of smart devices. In
present demo, the toolbox is applied to scan 3 smart me-
ters/power monitor systems. A potential risk list is gener-
ated and the vulnerabilities are further veriﬁed.
2. DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT
As shown in ﬁg. 1, the toolbox is developed on the Android
4.1, consisting of two parts: 1) a database is developed to
recode the communication protocols, storage structure, vul-
nerability & exploiting method, and authentication of smart
devices; 2) an open function platform is provided to integrate
various risk evaluation and veriﬁcation function module.
2.1 Conﬁguration and Risk Database
Communication Protocol: Most smart meters adopt
standard protocols in industry, such as Modbus and DNP3.0.
IP based protocols are regarded to be the future trend due
to its high data transfer rate, robustness and ﬁne fault tol-
erance. In this demo, the Modbus is applied.
Storage Structure: In most smart devices, the real-time
log data are stored in memory, and system parameters and
all historical log data are stored in NVRAM. A register map
is established to map the data to the register. In our work,
we analyze the data storage structure are generate the reg-

ister map, by analyzing the handbook and communication
traﬃc.
Authentication Mechanism: The authentication is
adopted in smart devices to prevent the invalid users. How-
ever, we found most of them are derived from the industrial
control systems which focus on the reliability, real-time and
cost, with little regard for information security. In our work,
many authentication mechanisms are collected and analyzed
to ﬁnd whether the invalid users can access the smart de-
vices.
Vulnerabilities and Exploiting: In the above investi-
gations, lots of vulnerabilities in smart devices are found.
Denial-of-Service (DoS): It is easy to launch a DoS at-
tack against smart device, since the service capability and
security defense ability of the smart devices are limited. For
example, one famous smart meter can support 13 TCP con-
versations and has not any mechanism to detect and discon-
nect duplicate links. When a hacker has created 13 conversa-
tions with this meter, any new request from valid users will
be denied. Weak Password: The passwords of many smart
meters are incredible weak, considering the password length
or charsets, resulting in authentication failure. For exam-
ple, one smart meter’s password is only composed of 4 dig-
its. And most meters have no mechanisms to prevent from
vicious password attempts, so it can be cracked easily by
brute force. Moreover, the power readings on smart meters
would cause user privacy leakage; the attackers can tamper
the parameters to refuse valid user access or lead data incon-
sistent problems; the hackers can bypass the authentication
to access the devices exploiting the forged identity.
2.2 Open Function Platform
The toolbox is developed on Android 4.1 platform.
In
present version, there are four function modules:
Scan and Evaluation Module is used to scan speciﬁed
network and ﬁnd out all the online smart meters. A list
of the basic conﬁguration information and risks evaluation
result for each online device is provided.
Password Risk Test Module is applied test the risk of
password exploiting various methods, including brute force
of weak password and bypassing authentication, etc.
User Privacy Test Module is developed to obtain the
device readings via sending data query requests. Moreover,
it can detect the change of measurement and predict the
user behaviors.

Parameter Risk Test Module is designed to modify
various parameters on devices, such as name, IP address,
time, System Hookup, current transformer Ratios (in smart
meter), etc.
3. DEMONSTRATION SETUP
We setup a mobile micro smart grid system, as shown
in Figure 2. Three common smart meters/power monitor
systems (i) − (iii) are deployed to measure the power con-
sumption of an electric kettle (iv) and the routers (v), which
are connected in the same network. An Android tablet (vi),
installed the Security Risks Evaluation Toolbox, is used to
scan the devices in this micro smart grid and evaluate the
risk of three smart meters. All potential risks could be fur-
ther veriﬁed accessing the smart meters.
