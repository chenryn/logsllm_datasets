## Abstract
Smart devices are widely deployed in smart grids for state measurement, decision-making, and remote control. The security of these devices is a growing concern. In this work, we analyze the communication protocols, storage mechanisms, and authentication methods of smart devices and develop a toolbox to evaluate their security risks. We apply our toolbox to scan three smart meters/power monitor systems, generating a list of potential risks and verifying the identified vulnerabilities.

## 1. Introduction
In smart grids (SGs), various smart devices are deployed to provide real-time measurement, transmission, decision-making, and control. However, these devices also present opportunities for attackers to compromise the SG. Common attacks, such as eavesdropping, information tampering, and malicious command injection, pose serious threats to the secure and stable operation of SGs. Our work identifies several common security risks in smart devices.

### 1.1 Security Risks in Smart Grids
- **Bad Data Injection (BDI):** Attackers can inject bad data into the SG by tampering with meter data. Large-scale BDI attacks [3, 5] can lead to incorrect decisions and false commands from the control center.
- **Privacy Leakage:** Malicious users can access smart devices to obtain user privacy. For example, user behaviors and appliance usage can be identified from power load profiles using non-intrusive load monitoring systems (NILMs) [2, 4].
- **Cyber Attacks:** Various cyber attacks, such as smart meter worms [1], meter botnets, DoS, fabricated authentication, and session hijacking, have been observed. The Stuxnet worm, for instance, attacked Iran’s Bushehr nuclear plant in 2010, damaging numerous centrifuges.

Preventing these security risks is challenging due to the widespread deployment of smart devices and their limited computational and storage capabilities. In our work, we investigate the communication protocols, storage mechanisms, and authentication methods of smart devices, identifying numerous vulnerabilities that could lead to serious attacks. We have developed a toolbox to evaluate these security risks. In this demo, the toolbox is applied to scan three smart meters/power monitor systems, generating a potential risk list and verifying the identified vulnerabilities.

## 2. Design and Implementation
Our toolbox, developed on Android 4.1, consists of two main parts:
1. A database to record communication protocols, storage structures, vulnerabilities, and authentication mechanisms.
2. An open function platform to integrate various risk evaluation and verification modules.

### 2.1 Configuration and Risk Database
- **Communication Protocol:** Most smart meters use standard industrial protocols like Modbus and DNP3.0. IP-based protocols are becoming more prevalent due to their high data transfer rates, robustness, and fault tolerance. In this demo, we use Modbus.
- **Storage Structure:** Real-time log data are typically stored in memory, while system parameters and historical log data are stored in NVRAM. We analyze the data storage structure and generate a register map by examining the device handbook and communication traffic.
- **Authentication Mechanism:** Authentication is used in smart devices to prevent unauthorized access. However, many mechanisms are derived from industrial control systems, which prioritize reliability, real-time performance, and cost over security. We collect and analyze various authentication mechanisms to identify potential weaknesses.
- **Vulnerabilities and Exploitation:**
  - **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** Smart devices are vulnerable to DoS attacks due to their limited service and security capabilities. For example, one smart meter supports only 13 TCP conversations and lacks mechanisms to detect and disconnect duplicate links.
  - **Weak Passwords:** Many smart meters have weak passwords, making them susceptible to brute-force attacks. For instance, one meter's password is only four digits long, and most meters lack mechanisms to prevent repeated password attempts.
  - **User Privacy Leakage:** Power readings on smart meters can reveal user behavior, and attackers can tamper with parameters to deny valid user access or cause data inconsistencies. Hackers can also bypass authentication to access devices using forged identities.

### 2.2 Open Function Platform
The toolbox includes four function modules:
- **Scan and Evaluation Module:** Scans the specified network to find all online smart meters and provides a list of basic configuration information and risk evaluation results for each device.
- **Password Risk Test Module:** Tests password strength and vulnerability to brute-force attacks and authentication bypassing.
- **User Privacy Test Module:** Obtains device readings via data query requests, detects changes in measurements, and predicts user behavior.
- **Parameter Risk Test Module:** Modifies various device parameters, such as name, IP address, time, system hookup, and current transformer ratios.

## 3. Demonstration Setup
We set up a mobile micro smart grid system, as shown in Figure 2. Three common smart meters/power monitor systems (i)–(iii) measure the power consumption of an electric kettle (iv) and routers (v), all connected to the same network. An Android tablet (vi) with the Security Risks Evaluation Toolbox installed scans the devices in this micro smart grid and evaluates the risks associated with the three smart meters. All potential risks are further verified by accessing the smart meters.
