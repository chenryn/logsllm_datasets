ABSTRACT
Graphical password methods rely on human experience and hand
selection (not well-quantiﬁed metric) to evaluate the appropriate-
ness and the confusion of the challenge images. In this paper we
propose to use for authentication Chinese characters, for which the
entropy can be up to 9.65 (much larger than other languages). We
ﬁrst show an algorithmic framework to authenticate a user and then
present an empirical analysis conducted at a university. The advan-
tages of the framework include the following: the storage overhead
is low; no personal experience or hand selection is involved; there
is no predeﬁned dictionary of likely choices; and it can be easily
referenced by personal-style cues.
Our study shows that the number of participants that prefer our
framework is much close to that in favor of graphical passwords,
with an interesting outcome that the two groups of participants
present signiﬁcantly distinct backgrounds. Our framework and graph-
ical passwords can be used as candidate authentication methods for
users with diﬀerent backgrounds. We also measure user choices of
patterns and ﬁnd that there is a slight preference of the 3×3 grid to
the circle patterns. While the proposed framework prescribes the
challenge characters, the users have the option to deﬁne challenge
characters of their own.

INTRODUCTION
Password-based authentication is the current dominant technol-
ogy to conﬁrm the (claimed) identities of legitimate users. Textual
passwords (composed of upper- and lower-case letters, digits, and
special symbols) are being widely applied in conventional authenti-
cation systems. As an alternative, graphical password method was
proposed as mnemonics of textual passwords with well studied us-
ability [8, 1, 5, 6, 7].
Graphical authentication techniques are particularly useful for
non-typewritten input devices (such as the mouse, stylus and touch
screen). A classical example for graphical passwords is PassFaces
[8]. As users tend to pick faces which they are attracted to in Pass-
faces, Dhamija and Perrig [5] used random art to generate random
abstract images for authentication. To avoid the exposure of pass-
word caused by the exposure of selected image, Kawagoe et al. [6]
proposed a tag association based graphical password where a set of
images are determined among a large collection in image search or
sharing web services using user pre-registered pass-terms.
We mention that the type of images used has a strong inﬂuence
on the resulting security. For example, if photographs are used,
the users’ choices might be highly correlated with race or gender
of the faces. Even if the images are not photographs, their attrac-
tiveness, intensity, hue, background color and so on might have
an inﬂuence on users’ choices. In general, the graphical password
methods need collect and store the candidate images (e.g., 135 JPG
ﬁles for Passfaces [8], 10,000 images for D´ej`a [7]), and collecting
the images with consistent quality highly relies on human experi-
ences and manual control to ﬁlter out simplistic or weak images
(e.g., 30% of all generated Random Art images in [5] are either
too simple or fall into a class of images frequently generated and
visually similar) or to group the images (black or white, male or fe-
male, etc). In fact, there is no known well-quantiﬁed measurement
to evaluate the appropriateness and the confusion of the images, so
that the pass images can be distinguished from the decoy images
easily by a human user but hard by a guessing attack.
In this paper, we propose to use for authentication Chinese char-
acters, for which the entropy can be up to 9.65 [12], much larger
than other languages. We ﬁrst show an algorithmic framework
to authenticate a user and then present an empirical analysis con-
ducted at a university. The advantages of the framework include
the following:
• The storage overhead for the framework is quite low as only
2 bytes are suﬃcient to store a single Chinese character;
• We can utilize the characters with similar frequencies (which
have been widely studied in terms of statistical analysis in the
1460literature [11]) and no personal experience or hand selection
is involved as in the graphical password setting [8, 5, 4];
• There is no predeﬁned dictionary of likely choices, as an En-
glish dictionary provides for English text passwords;
• The framework can be easily referenced by personal-style
cues (say Pinyin [9], stroke count [3], words [2] , etc).
Empirical analysis shows that the number of participants that pre-
fer our framework is much close to that in favor of graphical pass-
words, with an interesting outcome that the two groups of partic-
ipants present signiﬁcantly distinct backgrounds. Our framework
and graphical passwords can be used as candidate authentication
methods for users with diﬀerent backgrounds.
We also measure user choices of patterns by performing user
study and ﬁnd that there is a slight preference of the 3×3 grid to the
circle patterns.
2. OUR ALGORITHMIC FRAMEWORK
Chinese characters [2] are logograms used in the writing of Chi-
nese and some other Asian languages and constitute the oldest con-
tinuously used system of writing in the world. Chinese characters
number in the tens of thousands, 2,500 of which are common char-
acters and 1,000 are less-than-common characters [2]. It has been
analyzed that the entropy of Chinese characters is 9.65 [12], which
is much larger than other languages (e.g., 4.03 bits per letter in
English language [10]). And character frequency list of Modern
Chinese can be found easily [11]. When designing the algorithmic
framework for authentication, we recommend the most commonly
used characters so that the frequencies of the characters in the same
round are roughly the same.
Figure 1: Example grid of Chinese characters.
(a): in our
framework, a user’s password is composed of an iteration of
k (e.g., k=6) rounds, each a distinct set of n >1 characters. (b):
n=9, and characters are placed randomly in a 3×3 grid. The
characters used in the same grid have similar frequencies.
In our framework, a user’s password is composed of an iteration
of k (e.g., k=6) rounds, each a distinct set of n >1 characters like
the one in ﬁgure 1, for instance, n=9 and characters are placed ran-
domly in a 3×3 grid. The characters in the same round should have
similar frequencies so that no trivial or weak character exists, and
for convenience, we can use the top 9k most commonly used Chi-
nese characters c1, c2, ..., c9k [11]. We remark that only 2 bytes are
required for storing each Chinese character. While setting his pass-
word, the user is shown k successive 3×3 grids, each containing 9
characters. For the i-th round (i = 1, ..., k), characters c9i−8, ..., c9i
are presented. The user selects p (e.g., p =2) characters from each
round as the elements of his password. Therefore, characters are
unique and do not appear more than once for a given user.
During the authentication, m(≤ k) out of k sets of characters are
shown to the user. The characters of each set are the same as in the
registration step, but in randomly permuted positions. If the user
correctly identiﬁes all the characters belonging to his passwords,
he is authenticated successfully.
Our framework does not rely on people’s experience/hand se-
lection (but on the statistical analysis of the Chinese language for
which there is no predeﬁned dictionary of likely choices) to choose
the characters presented to the users. The characters selected can
be easily referenced by a personal-style cue (say Pinyin [9], stroke
count [3], words [2] , etc) so that the pass characters can be distin-
guished from the decoy characters obviously by the user but hard
by a guessing attack.

this implies 1 chance in 46,656 that the attacker could guess the
password at random. For comparison, consider the four-digit user-
selected PIN used globally on ATM networks, and the chances of
someone guessing a PIN are less than 1 in 10,000 [8].
(cid:17)
(cid:16)
Our framework provides countermeasures for observer attack.
First, the positions of the characters in each round are randomized.
Second, the size of the user’s password k is larger than the number
of the challenge rounds m, and the probability that an observer sees
the same characters after one observation is 1/
, which makes the
observer not easily impersonate the user. Lastly, combined with
masking (the characters in a grid are overwritten with a common
mask foreground) and limited authentication attempts (refusing to
permit authentication to proceed after suﬃciently incorrect authen-
tication attempts), it would be extremely diﬃcult for the observer
to learn the passwords as the user clicks on them.
While the proposed framework prescribes the challenge charac-
ters, the framework can be implemented using user-deﬁned chal-
lenge characters.
In this case, user ﬁrst registers his password,
then the framework would choose decoy characters with similar
frequency for each character from the password.

3. USER ACCEPTANCE
Our framework is useful when input devices do not permit type-
written input. To check the user acceptance for the proposed frame-
work, we conducted a pen & paper survey to ask users for some
statistical information about the framework and the patterns.
3.1 Participants
We went to diﬀerent departments of a university and recruited
randomly selected volunteers. Ninety-eight Chinese undergraduate
and graduate students participated in the survey, 51 of which are
from Liberal Arts colleges (Humanities and Social Science, For-
eign Languages, Business, and Social Development) and 47 from
Science and Engineering colleges (Information Science and Tech-
nology, Resources and Environmental Science, Finance and Statis-
tics, Life Sciences, Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry). This
had the advantage that members with diﬀerent background were
represented. Furthermore, all data collected during our study was
used in an anonymized way (i.e., there was no link between the
collected data and an individual user).
3.2 Results
A main purpose of our user study is to ﬁnd out the user accep-
tance for the proposed framework. With this question in mind, we
give the participants two options: one is our framework, the other
is almost the same except that the Chinese characters are replaced
by images (faces being the typical example, see ﬁgure 2). 45 out of
98 participants choose to use our framework, 14 of which are from
Science and Engineering colleges and the rest 31 are from Liberal
Arts colleges. The others choose to use images, 33 of which are
1461from Science and Engineering colleges and the rest 20 are from
Liberal Arts colleges. Figure 3 illustrates the results.

– 37.74% from Liberal Arts colleges; d – 62.26% from Science
and Engineering colleges.
While there is not much diﬀerence between the number of par-
ticipants choosing the proposed framework and those opting for the
images, the background of the participants is much diﬀerent. Par-
ticipants from Liberal Arts colleges are much more likely (with a
doubled percentage) to choose the framework and those from Sci-
ence and Engineering colleges are more in favor of images. Thus,
our framework and graphical passwords can be used as candidate
authentication methods for users with diﬀerent backgrounds.
Next we identify the preference of the participants on the au-
thentication patterns. As the positions of the characters within each
challenge set are randomized in our framework, we only compare
two patterns: (a) 3×3 grid pattern and (b) circle pattern, as showed
in ﬁgure 4. 55 out of 98 participants choose the grid pattern, of
which, 49.09% are from Science and Engineering colleges, 50.91%
from Liberal arts. The other 43 participants choose the circle pat-
tern, of which, 41.86% are from science and technology colleges,
and 58.14% from Liberal Arts colleges. One can see a slight pref-
erence of the 3×3 grid to the circle patterns.
