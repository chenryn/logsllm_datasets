titleblackhat:eu-20 How to Better Fuzz Windows 10 Directx Kernel at Present
DirectX is the engine that handles rendering on the Windows platform. Many outstanding people have made outstanding contributions in the research of DirectX. In this talk, I will share new research content of DirectX including the discovery of new attack methods, new paths, and how to design targeted fuzz based on these, and find related vulnerabilities. I will also introduce the experience of designing Windows kernel fuzz and explore how to better design closed source fuzz.
