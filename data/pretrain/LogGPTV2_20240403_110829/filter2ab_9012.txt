**Title: Advanced Techniques for Fuzzing the Windows 10 DirectX Kernel**

**Abstract:**

DirectX is the core engine responsible for rendering graphics on the Windows platform. Over the years, numerous researchers have made significant contributions to the study of DirectX. In this presentation, I will share the latest findings in DirectX research, including the identification of new attack vectors and previously undiscovered pathways. Additionally, I will discuss how to design targeted fuzzing strategies based on these discoveries to uncover related vulnerabilities.

I will also delve into the experience of designing fuzzers for the Windows kernel, with a particular focus on exploring effective methods for fuzzing closed-source components. This talk aims to provide valuable insights and practical techniques for enhancing the security and robustness of the DirectX kernel in Windows 10.

**Key Points:**
- Overview of recent advancements in DirectX research.
- Identification of new attack methods and pathways.
- Design and implementation of targeted fuzzing techniques.
- Best practices for fuzzing the Windows kernel, especially closed-source components.
- Case studies and real-world examples of vulnerability discovery.
