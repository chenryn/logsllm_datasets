average response delay [ms] and hop count. Highlighted val-
ues are analyzed in subsection 3.3.
Note that the fact that a particular organization announces a
particular IP prefix does not automatically mean it also runs all
of the nameservers within that prefix. Most importantly, this is
the case for AMAZON, MICROSOFT, and GOOGLE—all of which
provide VPS cloud services besides dedicated DNS hosting services—
where we see relatively high response delays, correlated with higher
hop counts.
Surprisingly, AMAZON leads the table with 16% share in DNS
transactions measured in DNS Observatory. This is likely due to
>5K of the most popular nameservers being VPS instances hosted
in AWS. Next, VERISIGN is rather expected, since it operates the
gTLD nameservers. The world’s 2 largest CDNs, AKAMAI and
CLOUDFLARE together handle 13% of observed DNS traffic. How-
ever, since CLOUDFLARE generally uses IP anycast, we see a few
times less nameserver IPs in the servers column than for AKAMAI.
We also note substantially lower response delays and hop counts,
which demonstrates that CDNs optimize these performance factors.

3.4 Query types
In Table 2, we analyze the top 10 QTYPEs, which in total represent
99.5% of all DNS transactions seen. The A query, used for fetching
the IPv4 address, is clearly the dominant query type, being ≈3 times
more popular than the AAAA query, used for fetching the IPv6
address (64% vs. 22% in global), which gives insight into the client-
side adoption of IPv6 and its Happy Eyeballs algorithm (which
we describe and analyze in depth in section 5). Moreover, while
only 0.6% of responses to A queries neither contain the answer nor
a delegation, for AAAA queries we see >40 times more NoData
responses (25%), which in turn gives insight into the server-side
IPv6 adoption, and into the issue of low negative caching TTLs
(see section 5). Also note the 22% rate of NXDOMAIN responses
for A queries vs. the 5.9% for AAAA: the data suggests A queries
are more likely to be used for DNS scanning and other automated
activity, such as Pseudo-Randomized Subdomain (PRSD) attacks
[23].
We were surprised to learn that PTR is so popular, accounting
for 6.4% of the DNS traffic. These queries are not normally issued
by web users, and rather come from servers and other Internet in-
frastructure. The higher value for qdots of 6.8 was expected, given
that reverse DNS records for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses have many
labels (resulting in 6 and 34 dots, respectively). However, we saw
25 TLDs per minute, which demonstrates some use of PTR beyond
reverse DNS [11] (normally only under the .arpa TLD). Note the
highest among other QTYPEs response delay of 44 ms, which sug-
gests that reverse DNS queries take ≈2 times longer than forward
DNS queries.
Only 1.4% of all transactions seen were NS queries, of which a
staggering 86% resulted in an NXDOMAIN response. By compar-
ing in the valid column the number of existing FQDNs seen per
minute vs. all FQDNs seen, we speculate that this is an indicator of
ongoing PRSD attacks. In this context, note the substantially higher
response size of 835 bytes, which puts additional strain on the DNS
infrastructure.
We found TXT transactions to be as popular as NS transactions,
yet surprisingly—comparing with other QTYPEs—the nameservers
handling TXT queries are more distant from the resolvers (the value
of hops equals to 10). Given the high value of qdots, the average
number of FQDNs per SLD, and generally low TTL value of 5 sec-
onds, we found the TXT records are often used for implementing
custom, proprietary protocols over the DNS. More careful inspec-
tion revealed the origin of these queries in anti-virus and anti-spam
systems.
3.5 Response delays
In Figure 3, we analyze response delays, i.e., the time difference
between sending the DNS query at the recursive to the authoritative
and receiving the response back at the recursive. Note that this
delay generally comes from two sources: the Internet transmission
delay, and the server processing delay. In order to better understand
the possible network delay, we additionally consider the number
of network hops between resolvers and nameservers, derived from
the IP initial TTL value, e.g., [39]. Our assumption is that in general
nameservers closer to resolvers (in terms of hop count) will have
lower network delay, and thus should respond faster.
92
We use the Top-100K nameserver list, already characterized in
subsection 3.2. On that list, only 50% of all DNS transactions, see
subsection 3.2): lower response delays indeed seem correlated with
the nameserver popularity. Moreover, the hop count statistic hints
at nameservers simply being located closer to the resolvers.
Finally, in Figure 3 (c) and (d), we characterize the root and gTLD
nameservers, respectively. In each case, there are 13 nameservers
labeled ‘A’ through ‘M’, each deployed using IP anycast. We find
varying median response delays for the root nameservers—yet
roughly correlated with the hop count—which reflects the diversity
in organizations and deployments behind the root nameservers.
As expected, root nameservers with the most mirrors at different
locations, namely E, F, and L, are also the fastest. In total, the root
nameservers handle 3.0% of all DNS queries seen, 96.2% of which,
however, result in an NXDOMAIN response [9].
The performance of gTLD nameservers is more consistent, re-
vealing groups of servers with similar characteristics, and thus
likely deployed in a similar way and at close locations. The B gTLD
nameserver is the fastest, and thus the most affected by the bot-
net traffic described in subsection 3.2. In total, gTLD nameservers
handle 9.6% of all DNS queries seen, 26.4% of which resulted in an
NXDOMAIN response.
3.6 Use of QNAME minimization
As queried domains might reveal private information, the technique
QNAME minimization (qmin) thwarts this by no longer sending
the full original query name (QNAME) to the authoritative name
servers. Instead, resolvers iteratively query longer QNAMEs by
prepending labels from the original QNAME. As qmin was stan-
dardized relatively recently in 2016 [8], we evaluate its deployment
on root and TLD name servers and compare our results to related
work [13].
First, we group the authoritatives into root, TLD, and others
using root zone data [38]. We evaluate the QNAMEs sent between
each resolver and authoritative pair, as shown in Table 3. To increase
confidence in our evaluation we only provide negative qmin results,
i.e., we classify name servers as non-qmin instead of positively
marking them as qmin. Root name servers are authoritative for the
root zone. They are therefore expected to receive queries with only

one QNAME label (e.g., com) from qmin resolvers. If we find any
QNAMEs in a resolver-root name server pair with more than one
QNAME label (e.g., example.com), we classify this pair as non-qmin.
TLD name servers are authoritative for the respective TLD zone.
They are therefore expected to receive queries with at most two
QNAME labels (e.g., example.com) from qmin resolvers. If we find
any QNAMEs in a resolver-TLD name server pair with more than
two QNAME labels (e.g., www.example.com), we classify this pair
as non-qmin. In this study we only evaluate QNAMEs sent to root
and TLD authoritatives, as other authoritatives (e.g., SLD name
servers) can not be reliably classified as qmin or non-qmin.
When evaluating resolver-root name server pairs we find three
resolvers which are possible qmin-enabled resolvers. All three re-
solvers are located in prefixes belonging to the same university and
send DNS requests containing FQDNs with at most one QNAME
label to different root servers. We check if these resolvers indicate
non-qmin behavior for other name servers, which we did not find.
For resolver-TLD name server pairs we find two potential in-
stances of qmin deployment. We again cross-check these resolvers

Foremski, Gasser, and Moura
We also make the requirement of qdots more lenient to account
for TLD name servers which host zones with more than one la-
bels (e.g.,.uk also hosts .co.uk, .il also hosts .org.il, .me also hosts
.net.me). We whitelist these TLD name server configurations to
allow QNAMEs with three labels. This less strict definition of qmin,
however, does not find any additional qmin resolvers.
In total qmin-enabled resolvers send about 18 k queries to root
name servers and 4 k to TLD name servers per day. This makes
up a minuscule share of 0.005 % and 0.0001 % of all traffic to root
and TLD servers, respectively. This is in stark contrast to related
work which sees about 40 % qmin deployment at the .nl TLD name
server [13]. A more recent study by Huston [34] also finds low
deployment of qmin, finding that about 3 % of users take advantage
of the technique. One possible explanation for varying deployment
statistics is the different methodology used to identify qmin queries,
i.e., DeVries et al. label a resolver as qmin if 97 % of queries are
classified as minimized [13], whereas we apply a strict notion of
100 % qmim queries.
3.7 Data representativeness
We run several experiments to evaluate the representativeness of
our data. First, in Figure 4a), we show that the number of authorita-
tive nameservers seen in 1 hour converges to a limit of 500K-600K
when we increase the fraction of available vantage points from
0 to 100%. In each step, we take a random sample of all available
resolvers, and listen to DNS traffic continuously for 1 hour. We
report the average values obtained by repeating the experiment 20
times. The plot suggests we miss some visibility beyond the 100%
mark (which represents all resolvers used for this paper), but the
shape of the curve suggests a relatively small, bounded number of
the “missing” nameservers. Otherwise, if the number of resolvers
was too low to characterize the DNS nameservers, we would see a
curve not converging to a limit, or even a linear relation.
In order to preview anticipated improvements to our system,
the blue curves labelled “DNS Observatory” show the results ob-
tained for this paper (using only the main SIE passive DNS channel),
whereas the red curves labelled “Available data” show the results
obtained using more vantage points (using all available SIE passive
DNS channels), planned for future inclusion.
Recall that in Figure 2a) we demonstrate that the majority of the
observed DNS traffic is handled by a small number of the most pop-
