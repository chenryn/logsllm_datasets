User: I know this is really basic but it is frustrating.  I'm using Python 2 to try and create my first program (in Windows 7 64bit).  Every guide I look at says to install Python2, then go to the command prompt and type python.  But... I get an error, because python.exe is not in that directory.  So I change to the "python27" directory, and it runs fine.  But then when I want to run a program, I type python HelloWorld, but of course that doesn't work.  I need to be in the directory that has both the python.exe, and the directory that has my program file.
Surely everyone does not have all of their programs in the python install directory; what am I missing?
Assistant: You have basically two possibilities:

Use the full path to the Python interpreter when starting you program, e.g. c:\Python2.7\python.exe HelloWorld
Add the directory of the Python interpreter to your PATH environment variable. I can't tell you how to do this in Windows 7, though.
