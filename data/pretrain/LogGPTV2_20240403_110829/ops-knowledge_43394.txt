User: I am trying to write a simple telned server that will expose a IPython shell to the connected client. Does someone know how to do that ?
The question is really about embedding the IPython shell into the Telnet server (I can probably use Twisted for the Telnet server part )
Thx
Assistant: I think it is not possible provide full functionality of IPython, such as auto complete,.. Twisted has python shell that works well with telnet.
