User: I'm using windows cmd to run my python script. I want to run my python script withouth to give the cd command and the directory path.
I would like to type only the name of the python script and run it.
I'm using python 2.7
Assistant: Make sure .py files are associated with the Python launcher C:\Windows\py.exe or directly with e.g. 'C:\Python27\python.exethen edit yourPATHEXTenvironment variable using (System Properties) to add;.PY` at the end. You can now launch Python files in the current directory by typing their name.
To be able to launch a given Python script from any directory, you can either put it in a directory that's already on the PATH, or add a new directory to PATH (I like creating a bin directory in my user folder and adding %USERPROFILE%\bin to PATH) and put it there.
Note that this is more a "how do I use Windows" question rather than a Python question.
