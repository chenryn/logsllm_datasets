Salute,
currently the GP module does not allow to use multiple input feature with the
same value. At least from the math point of view there is no need for this
restriction. Though, I didn't go through the whole implementation to see if
there is something special about it that would require this restriction. I
tested it on some dummy problem (with noisy data) with and without multiple
equal inputs and it worked fine and, not surprisingly, even better when using
duplicates (more data yeay!).  
Any reasons to keep it?
