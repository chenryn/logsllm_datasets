Subject: Inquiry Regarding Multiple Input Features with the Same Value in GP Module

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inquire about a specific restriction within the GP (Gaussian Process) module, which currently does not permit the use of multiple input features with identical values.

From a mathematical standpoint, there appears to be no inherent necessity for this limitation. However, I have not thoroughly reviewed the entire implementation to determine if there are any underlying reasons that necessitate this constraint.

To further investigate, I conducted a test using a simple, noisy dataset. The results showed that the GP model performed satisfactorily both with and without duplicate input values. Interestingly, the performance was even better when duplicates were included, as expected, since more data generally leads to improved model accuracy.

Given these observations, I would like to understand if there are any specific reasons for maintaining this restriction. If not, it might be beneficial to relax this constraint to allow for greater flexibility in handling datasets with repeated input values.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your insights.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
