Assistant: This log chunk shows the process of assigning and running tasks in stage 26.0. It also shows the computation of partitions rdd_42_30, rdd_42_31, rdd_42_32, rdd_42_33, rdd_42_34, and rdd_42_35. The log also shows the estimated size of each block stored in memory and the total, boot, init, and finish times for each task.
