### Definitions and Operations

- **W [1 . . . S]**: A vector of tuples (ts, fr, cc, vec), initially empty.
- **READ()**: An operation to read data.

### Event Handling

#### Upon Receiving `collect ack(cid:104)tsr, ci(cid:105)` from Server \( s_i \)
- No specific action is defined in the provided text. This section may need further clarification or completion.

#### Upon Receiving `filter ack(cid:104)tsr, ts, fr, cc, vec(cid:105)` from Server \( s_i \)
- **Step 1**: Select a candidate \( c \) from set \( C \) such that \( c \) is a high candidate and safe.
- **Step 2**: Restore the value \( V \) using \( c.ts \).
- **Step 3**: Repair \( c \).
- **Step 4**: If the repair is successful, return \( V \); otherwise, return \( \bot \).

### Data Structures and Conditions
- **R**: Set of servers that have responded.
- **W [i]**: Update the vector with the tuple (ts, fr, cc, vec).
- **C**: Remove invalid candidates from the set.
- **Q**: Add the server index \( i \) to the set.
- **Condition**: If \( ci.ts > ts0 \), add \( ci \) to the set \( C \).

### Vector Restoration
- **vec**: Find a vector \( vec' \) such that there exists a subset \( R' \subseteq R \) with \( |R'| \geq t + 1 \) where:
  - For all \( i \in R' \), \( W[i].ts = c.ts \) and \( W[i].vec = vec' \).

### Repair Procedure
- **Procedure**: `repair(c)`
  - **Step 1**: Check if \( c.vec \neq vec \).
  - **Step 2**: Update \( c.vec \) to \( vec \).
  - **Step 3**: Send a `repair(cid:104)tsr, c(cid:105)` message to all servers.
  - **Step 4**: Wait for `repair ack(cid:104)tsr(cid:105)` from \( S - t \) servers.

### Predicates
- **safe(c)**: There exists a subset \( R' \subseteq R \) with \( |R'| \geq t + 1 \) where:
  - For all \( i \in R' \), \( W[i].ts = c.ts \).
  - For all \( i, j \in R' \), \( W[i].cc = W[j].cc \) and \( H(W[i].fr) = W[j].cc[i] \).
  - For all \( i, j \in R' \), \( W[i].vec = W[j].vec \).

### Security and Authentication
- **DSA**: Use 1024-bit DSA for generating signatures. Message authentication is abstracted away for simplicity, as it is typically handled by the access control layer in realistic settings (e.g., Wide Area Networks).

### Deployment and Evaluation
- **Network Setup**:
  - Private network with multiple machines: 4-core Intel Xeon E5443, 4 core Intel i5-3470, 8-core Intel i7-3770, and 64-core Intel Xeon E5606.
  - Communication bridged using a 1 Gbps switch.
  - Servers run on separate processes on the Xeon E5606, while clients are distributed among the other machines.

- **Client Behavior**:
  - Each client invokes operations in a closed loop, with at most one pending operation.
  - All write and read operations are served by a local database stored on disk.

- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Peak throughput for write and read operations.
  - Latency incurred in M-PoWerStore compared to M-ABD and Phalanx.
  - File sizes: 64 KB, 128 KB, 256 KB, 512 KB, and 1024 KB.
  - Server failure threshold \( t \): 1, 2, and 3.

- **Default Parameters**:
  - Failure threshold \( t \): 1
  - File size: 256 KB
  - Probability of Concurrency: 1%
  - Workload Distribution: 100% read or 100% write

### Throughput and Latency
- **Throughput Measurement**:
  - Increase the number of writers until the aggregated throughput is saturated.
  - Compute peak throughput as the maximum amount of data (in bytes) written/read per second.

- **Latency and Throughput in LAN Setting**:
  - M-PoWerStore achieves lower latencies and higher throughput than M-ABD and Phalanx.
  - Read latencies are lower than write latencies due to the extra communication round for writes.
  - Erasure coding in M-PoWerStore minimizes overhead and improves performance.

- **Throughput with Respect to File Size**:
  - As file size increases, M-PoWerStore's performance gain becomes more significant.
  - For 1 MB files, M-PoWerStore approaches network-limited bounds of 50 MB/s for reads and 45 MB/s for writes.

### Simulated WAN Setting
- **Network Emulation**:
  - Use a 100 Mbps switch and NetEm to emulate packet delay variance specific to WANs.
  - Add a Pareto distribution with a mean of 20 ms and a variance of 4 ms.

- **Performance in WAN**:
  - M-PoWerStore maintains superior performance in both read and write operations.
  - Overhead of erasure-coded file transmission increases asymptotically towards 3|F| as \( t \) increases.

### Related Work
- **HAIL and IRIS**:
  - HAIL and IRIS use PoR for integrity protection but differ in design space and assumptions.
  - IRIS pre-serializes clients through a trusted portal, while M-PoWerStore relies on distributed PoW.

- **Robust Storage Implementations**:
  - ABD, PASIS, and Loft use different strategies for robustness and resilience.
  - M-PoWerStore is the first BFT protocol with bounded servers and metadata-only writes.

- **BFT Storage Protocols**:
  - Comparison of properties in Table 3 shows M-PoWerStore's advantages in latency, message complexity, and Byzantine fault tolerance.

- **Forking Semantics**:
  - Research on forking semantics relaxes atomicity to achieve better performance.
