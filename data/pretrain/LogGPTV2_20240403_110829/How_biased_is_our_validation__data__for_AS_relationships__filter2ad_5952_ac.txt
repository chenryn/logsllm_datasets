Table 3: Per group validation table for Toposcope
(i.e., the number of True Positives, False Positives, True Negatives,
and False Negatives) that result from treating either P2C links or
P2P links as the "positive class."
Tables 1, 3, and 2 show the following classification correctness
metrics for links of different classes8: (i) precision (𝑃𝑃𝑉𝑋 ) and (ii)
recall (𝑇 𝑃𝑅𝑥) when choosing P2P links (𝑋 → 𝑃) or P2C (𝑋 → 𝐶)
links as positive class9, the number of P2P (𝑋 → 𝑃) and P2C (𝑋 →
𝐶) links per class as 𝐿𝐶𝑋 , and Matthew’s correlation coefficient
(MCC) as symmetric evaluation metric10.
Simply put, the MCC takes all values of the confusion matrix into
account (i.e., it does not matter which class is treated as positive),
is relatively robust against class imbalance (i.e., the fraction of
validated P2P/P2C links in a class), and ranges between -1 and 1;
values close to 1/-1 indicate positive/negative correlation between
inference and validation while values close to 0 indicate correctness
similar to an unbiased coin-toss [19].
Each table further colors differences between the classification
correctness on the entire data set (Total°) as follows: If the per-class
value is at least 1 % larger than the value for the entire data set,
8we only show those classes that contained at least 500 relationships in summary
9As they only provide additional mixtures of precision and recall, we decided to not
show (balanced) accuracy and f1-score.
10The Fowlkes–Mallows index—as the second prominent symmetric evaluation metric—
showed slightly less numerical change, yet similar results.
it is colored in green; if it is at least 1 %, 5 %, and 10 % lower, it is
colored in yellow, orange, and red, respectively.
The tables first confirm common wisdom: All three algorithms
perform near-perfect for P2C links. Yet, our evaluation further
shows that all algorithms struggle with the same P2P link classes,
namely AR-L, S-T1, and T1-TR. The low correctness for S-T1 links
was already reported by [36], yet we disagree with their conclu-
sion that "peering relationships between high-tier ASes and low-
tier ASes are becoming more prevalent." We observe that most
of those 26 links are formed with research ASes, anycast-based
DNS providers, content delivery networks, and cloud providers,
i.e., we observe that the problem lies in the broad aggregation of
many diverse businesses models into a single "Stub" class, rather
than a drastic change in policies. The overall correctness gap for
P2P-based T1-TR relationships of up to 25 % shows that future
classification efforts can still make substantial improvements for
certain link classes. Yet, the increase of the correctness gap from
ASRank to the two follow-up algorithms shows that following a
strategy of simply improving the overall classification error can
lead to substantial correctness degradation for classes that contain
fewer links. Finally, the reduced correctness for AR-L relationships
might hint towards unique routing policies in the LACNIC region
that are not yet captured by algorithms that were constructed and
validated almost exclusively on the policies present in the RIPE and
ARIN regions.
6.1 Case Study: AS714 Cogent Communications
To better understand the low performance for the T1-TR class, we
do a case study for AS714 (Cogent Communications). We chose
AS714 as it is involved in around half (54 out of 111) of all the links
that were wrongly inferred as P2P (i.e., those links that decreased
𝑃𝑃𝑉𝑃) by ASRank (which has the best precision and recall for this
class). For the remainder of this section, we call those links "target
links."
When analyzing the paths that include our 54 target links, we
were unable to find any triplet "𝐶|𝐴𝑆714|𝑋" for which 𝐴𝑆714|𝑋 is a
target link and 𝐶 is another clique AS. This observation is critical as
such triplets are necessary for ASRank to arrive at a P2C inference
for 𝐴𝑆714|𝑋. While this provides us inside into what algorithmically

caused the wrong inference, it does not explain why or how the
routing phenomena that underpin those algorithms have changed.
To analyze target links beyond the public routing data, we focus
on the 17 links that are also inferred to be P2P links in the most
recent (Sept. 2021) snapshot. This allows us to directly trigger Co-
gent’s looking glass to further investigate. We find that all the ASes
involved in the 17 links consistently tag the routes they redistribute
to 𝐴𝑆714 with the BGP Community 174:99111. This community
prevents Cogent from redistributing the received routes to other
peers—including all of the other clique members.
We discussed the issue with few of the involved operators and
also looked up the related RPSL routing policy objects via RADB.
We found that there are two reasons why ASes tagged this commu-
nity: Cogent only offers them partial transit (i.e., routes towards
customers but not towards peers) and inaccurate validation data12
(only 1 case).
7 DISCUSSION & OUTLOOK
Bias Mismatches. Throughout this paper, we demonstrated bias
mismatches between inferred and validated relationships. While
the features that we analyzed showed substantial mismatches, other
features could introduce similar (or even greater) ones. Even though
a more complex analysis of additional groups of "hard links" lies
beyond the scope of this paper, we provide a list of twelve potential
features for future analysis in the Appendix (§C).
Balance Through Sampling. While over-sampling of small
classes or under-sampling of large classes are commonly used tech-
niques to counteract biases, neither of them works (by default)
well on AS relationships. Under-sampling prominent classes would
result in a reduction of the already too small number of validated
relationships. In contrast, simple over-sampling would bias the im-
portance of specific error types (and often lead to over-fitting for
ML-based classifiers). While there are more complex over-sampling
methods (e.g., SMOTE [17], ADASYN [30], or MDO [1]) that synthet-
ically (based on interpolation) produce new yet similar data points,
theses techniques may introduce "incorrect" validation information
when working with high dimensional data [23]. Yet, we might be
able to leverage the heterogeneity and intrinsic, continuous change
of the routing ecosystem to our advantage. If we understand for
how long a certain set of relationships remains unchanged (e.g., via
frequent exchange with network operators), we may be able to find
a time frame after which the same AS can be re-sampled while still
providing a unique-enough, new data point.
Future Validation Data. Most of our current validation data
is passively obtained by scraping (poorly maintained) operator
databases. We argue that compiling more extensive validation data
requires active collaboration with network operators. In particular,
we must clearly communicate incentives (e.g., services that they
can benefit from) for why operators should accurately report (some
of) their relationships through the channels they most commonly
use (e.g., during operator meetings). A successful story using such
a do-ut-des approach is the route collector project "Isolario." In only
four years, the project acquired more peer ASes than RIPE RIS or
11Notably, this community is stripped before redistribution to customers; hence, it is
rarely visible from the public routing infrastructure.
12i.e., contrary to the community-based validation data, the link is a P2P link rather
than a P2C link.

Routeviews by partnering with HE.net. Whenever an AS connected
to Isolario, HE.net would use the provided data to improve its statis-
tics. The increase in reported size rendered the AS more attractive
as a peering partner—a benefit that convinced many networks to
continuously provide data.
Arguably, some operators may consider business relationships
more sensitive than the routing information observed by a single
(carefully selected) router. Yet, accurate information about a net-
work’s business relationships may be used to compile more valuable
assets than simple statistics. One example would be router config-
urations generated by the Peerlock system. Peerlock utilizes rela-
tionship information to generate snippets of router configurations
that prevent the redistribution of (accidental) route leaks [47].The
mechanism’s effectiveness may depend on the number of consid-
ered business relationships. Hence, operators might be willing to
provide (and continuously update) their relationships in exchange
for more secure and up-to-date Peerlock configurations. Similarly,
relationship information may also be used to engineer recommen-
dation systems for peering opportunities, i.e., rankings of beneficial
IXPs (to peer at) and ASes (to peer with) for a given network.
Notably, the targeted interaction with operators could also coun-
teract the current problem of missing validation data for an entire
region that was reported in §5.
Future Research Efforts. Our analysis in §6 showed that (negli-
gible) improvements in global classification correctness can severely
impact the correctness for classes with potentially fewer links. In
line with this finding, we argue that the current goal of negligibly
improving the overall correctness actually hinders progress in this
