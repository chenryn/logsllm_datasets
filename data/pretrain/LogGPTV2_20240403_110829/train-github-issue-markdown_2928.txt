I encountered an issue while using the following statement in a TypeScript source file, as referenced from the Angular documentation:

```typescript
declare var angular: angular.IAngularStatic;
```

The error I received is:

```
Cannot find namespace 'angular'.
```

I also tested this in a quickstart project, and the same issue persists.
