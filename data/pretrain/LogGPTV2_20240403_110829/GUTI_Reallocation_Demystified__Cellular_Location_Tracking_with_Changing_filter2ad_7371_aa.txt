Abstract—To keep subscribers’ identity confidential, a cellular
network operator must use a temporary identifier instead of
a permanent one according to the 3GPP standard. Temporary
identifiers include Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (TMSI)
and Globally Unique Temporary Identifier (GUTI) for GSM/3G
and Long-Term Evolution (LTE) networks, respectively. Unfortu-
nately, recent studies have shown that carriers fail to protect
subscribers in both GSM/3G and LTE mainly because these
identifiers have static and persistent values. These identifiers
can be used to track subscribers’ locations. These studies have
suggested that temporary identifiers must be reallocated fre-
quently to solve this privacy problem. The only mechanism to
update the temporary identifier in current LTE implementations
is called GUTI reallocation. We investigate whether the current
implementation of the GUTI reallocation mechanism can provide
enough security to protect subscribers’ privacy.
To do this, we collect data by performing GUTI reallocation
more than 30,000 times with 28 carriers across 11 countries
using 78 SIM cards. Then, we investigate whether (1) these
reallocated GUTIs in each carrier show noticeable patterns and
(2) if they do, these patterns are consistent among different
SIM cards within each carrier. Among 28 carriers, 19 carriers
have easily predictable and consistent patterns in their GUTI
reallocation mechanisms. Among the remaining 9 carriers, we
revisit 4 carriers to investigate them in greater detail. For all these
4 carriers, we could find interesting yet predictable patterns after
invoking GUTI reallocation multiple times within a short time
period. By using this predictability, we show that an adversary
can track subscribers’ location as in previous studies. Finally,
we present a lightweight and unpredictable GUTI reallocation
mechanism as a solution.
I.
INTRODUCTION
A user’s identity is inevitably exposed over the air interface
of a cellular network depending on the cellular network design.
An “IMSI catcher” has been used to track a user’s location by
catching the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI),
that is, the permanent identity of the user exposed as plaintext
on the air interface. Recently, many studies have focused on how
to avoid IMSI catching [18], [19], [23], [29], [34], [35], [42].

this problem and designed cellular protocols to use a Temporary
Mobile Subscriber Identity (TMSI) instead of a permanent one
in 2G/3G, except in unavoidable situations such as the initial
attach [2]. In Long-Term Evolution (LTE) networks, a Globally
Unique Temporary Identifier (GUTI) is used. However, the
3GPP standard does not specify guidelines for when and how to
update the temporary identity, and it leaves the implementation
and update frequency to operators.
Recent studies have shown that the absence of a standard
guideline has resulted in the problem of reusing temporary
identities [20], [30]. Kune et al. showed that reusing TMSI, as
in existing IMSI catcher attacks, triggers a security threat that
can expose a victim’s location in Global System for Mobile
Communications (GSM) [20]. They noted that if an attacker
calls the victim multiple times, he/she can expose the victim’s
TMSI on the broadcast channel of the air interface. Note that the
attacker uses silent calls, in which he/she hangs up before the
victim’s phone rings to avoid alerting the victim. If the victim is
in the same location area (LA) as the attacker, the same TMSI
will appear on the channel each time a call to the victim is
repeated. Shaik et al. showed that the same attack is possible in
Voice over LTE (VoLTE) [30]. Both studies suggested frequent
reassignment of identity to solve this problem, because it is
difficult to track a user’s location if the temporary identity is
changed.
In LTE networks, GUTI reallocation is the only procedure
available for changing the GUTI. If GUTI reallocation changes
the GUTI for each voice call, the existing location tracking
attack does not work. According to the 3GPP standard, GUTI
reallocation can be invoked when (1) a network triggers a non-
access stratum “GUTI Reallocation Command,” (2) the User
Equipment (UE) attaches to the LTE, and (3) a Tracking Area
Update (TAU) occurs [4]. If GUTI reallocation is performed
for each call, LTE may become safer against location tracking.
However, simply changing the GUTI is not a complete solution
against location tracking. Fundamentally, unpredictable GUTI
allocation is required to solve the above-described problem.
To investigate this problem, we collected traces of cellular
call flows after invoking GUTI reallocation more than 30,000
times for 28 carriers in 11 countries using 78 Subscriber Identity
Module (SIM) cards worldwide. Data were collected during
our visits to conferences and project meetings and during
our vacations. This dataset was mainly collected to determine
whether the GUTI reallocation mechanism is securely designed,
implemented, and deployed for different carriers. We invoke
GUTI reallocation using Circuit Switched Fallback (CSFB),
a circuit switched voice call service provided by many LTE
carriers worldwide. Because most operators require detachment
from and attachment to LTE before and after CSFB, we
cause GUTI reallocation by implementing auto-call, that is, we
repeatedly place calls and hang up automatically.
We analyzed this dataset carefully for each carrier. First, we
note that every pattern was consistent within a carrier. In other
words, the patterns we found for GUTI reallocation across
different SIM cards from a single carrier remain the same. Out
of 28 carriers, we discovered simple patterns in 19 carriers.
These patterns include varying length of constant bytes as well
as monotonically increasing the sequence of bytes. With such
predictable patterns, we could track a victim’s location as in
the previous work [20]. For nine carriers, we initially could
not find any pattern. However, we hypothesized that these
remaining carriers might still have problems, because previous
studies have revealed that the telecommunication industry’s
implementations are often ad-hoc in nature [39], [40]. For
further investigation, we visited four of these nine carriers after
implementing a stress test, in which a voice call was rushed
within a short period. Depending on the number of calls, all
four carriers showed interesting patterns. For example, a carrier
skipped GUTI reallocation for less than 10 rushing voice calls.
In our global-scale measurement analysis, we did not
find a single carrier that
implemented GUTI reallocation
securely. The 3GPP standard body also seems aware of the
importance of GUTI reallocation as noted in its technical
report [1], which discusses this problem through two issues.
Issue #7.1 reviews the study by Shaik et al. and notes that
poor Mobility Management Entity (MME) implementations
or carrier misconfigurations may result in the same GUTIs
being assigned. Issue #7.4 covers relatively less important
issues, such as the fact that poor implementations of temporary
identifiers may lead to subscriber identification. For example,
T M SI = ISM I||Counter, where || is the concatenation
operation; in this case, TMSI reveals IMSI. Issue #7.1 examines
repeated GUTIs, whereas Issue #7.4 examines information
leakage due to the choice of GUTIs. Our analysis shows that
most carriers have already implemented a solution for both
Issue #7.1 (having different GUTIs after reallocation) and Issue
#7.4 (seeming lack of relation to IMSI). We show that Issue
#7.1 is insufficiently handled in the current GUTI reallocation
problem.
Possibly owing to the lack of a detailed guideline as
well as requirements, carriers and manufacturers have used
insecure implementations thus far. In fact, operators tend
to skip implementations not specified in the standard for
network performance optimization. After analyzing associated
3GPP standards and our dataset carefully, we first present
detailed requirements to safely implement the GUTI reallocation
mechanism. Based on this requirement, we present a light and
unpredictable GUTI reallocation mechanism. The technical
report also introduces high-level solutions to this problem,
specified as Solutions #7.23 and #7.24 [1]. The solution
generates a random GUTI using one of the subscriber keys
used for authentication. In Section VII, we explain why such
a solution is unnecessary.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II provides back-
ground information related to cellular networks. Section III de-
scribes related work. Section IV outlines the GUTI reallocation
rules for each carrier through global-scale measurement analysis

of ID management in cellular networks. Section V examines
the impact of stress-testing on identity reallocation. Section VI
describes the actual attack performed based on information
obtained from the measurement analysis. Section VII provides
a solution for privacy leakage related to identity management.
Finally, Section VIII concludes this paper and discusses future
works.
II. PRELIMINARY
In this section, we briefly review the cellular network
architecture as well as identities and procedures associated
with location leaks.
A. Overview of Cellular Network Architecture
Figure 1 shows the overall architecture of 3G and LTE
networks. Both cellular network systems can be divided into
three components: (1) UE, (2) a Radio Access Network (RAN),
and (3) a core network. The UE represents the user’s device used
for subscribing and communicating to the network. The RAN
comprises a number of base stations, called eNodeB in LTE
(NodeB in 3G), that are responsible for radio communication
between the UE and the core network. The core network has
multiple components that serve voice calls, handover, and data
service. The MME is responsible for tracking the location of
the UE and managing the connection. The crucial difference
between 3G and LTE in the core network is the way in which
they deliver data and voice calls. In both networks, data services
such as the Internet are provided through packet-switched
domains of each network. 3G handles voice calls through
a circuit-switched domain and the Public Switched Telephone
Network (PSTN), whereas LTE does so using the VoLTE packet-
switched domain that is served by an IP Multimedia Subsystem
(IMS).
When an LTE carrier does not support VoLTE, it uses CSFB
to support a circuit-switched voice call in 3G. When a UE
wants to make a voice call in such an LTE network, it first
detaches from the LTE network by releasing its resources at
the LTE network. Then, it connects to the 3G network through
which the call is served. Following the voice call, the UE
reattaches its connection to the LTE network.
With regard to the geographical architecture, a service area
managed by an eNodeB is called a “Cell.” One eNodeB covers

a group of cells, and the area covered by a group of eNodeB
is called the “Tracking Area” (TA; Location Area in 3G). The
TA has a unique code called the Tracking Area Code (TAC),
and the MME manages the subscriber location by combining
the TAC with the MME code (MMEC).
B. Identifiers in Cellular Network
The IMSI is a subscriber’s permanent and unique identifier
in a cellular network [2]. It is stored in the SIM, and exposing
it can lead to security issues such as location tracking and
eavesdropping [31], [32]. Therefore, instead of delivering IMSI
through the open air interface, carriers use a temporary identifier
to hide a subscriber’s identity. Systems older than LTE used
TMSI for device identification, whereas LTE uses GUTI. GUTI
consists of two parts: a Globally Unique Mobility Management
Entity Identifier (GUMMEI) and an MME-Temporary Mobile
Subscriber Identity (M-TMSI) (Figure 2). The GUMMEI
comprises multiple identifiers for network identification: Mobile
Country Code (MCC), Mobile Network Code (MNC), and
Mobility Management Entity ID (MME ID). The M-TMSI,
consists of a temporary and unique 32-bit value that is used
to identify a UE within an MME. The MME assigns a GUTI
to a UE when the latter attaches to the network (ATTACH) or
updates its tracking area (TAU). Thereafter, the UE and MME
use the allocated GUTI for identification and communication
between the UE and the MME instead of the IMSI. To hide
information pertaining to the mapping between subscribers and
GUTI, the MME often reallocates GUTI. Note that because
the 3GPP standard does not specify the frequency or rules
for this reallocation, it is performed using operator-specific
configurations [2]. For example, an MME system implemented
by Cisco provides two options for triggering GUTI reallocation:
time and frequency of access attempts [11]. It can be configured
to perform the GUTI reallocation procedure for every N
ATTACH or TAU requests or periodically every T minutes.
C. Paging
Paging is a procedure used when the network wakes up the
UE to set up a connection for data service, incoming calls, or
Short Message Service (SMS). In such events, the MME lets the
eNodeB send an S1AP Radio Resource Control (RRC) paging
message to the target UE. We refer to the RRC paging message
as simply paging message hereafter. Because the MME does
not know the exact eNodeB that covers the target UE when it is
idle, it sends S1AP paging messages to all eNodeBs in the TA
(paging for voice call). On receiving the S1AP paging message
from the MME, an eNodeB broadcasts paging messages through
a Paging Control Channel (PCCH). A paging message contains
an identifier to designate the UE in the ue-Identity field, in
which there are two options for UE identification: S-TMSI
and IMSI [7]. A UE listens to the paging channel periodically
and decodes PagingRecords in the paging message. It checks
whether the paging message is targeted to itself by comparing
identifiers in the ue-Identity field. Note that because the paging
message is not encrypted, identifiers in the paging message are
3
available to others listening on the same paging channel and
located in the same TA. Once a UE in an idle state receives its
paging message, it initiates the Random Access Procedure
to establish a connection with the LTE network. The network
then provides the relevant data service or notifies the UE of an
incoming call. In the case of paging initiated by an incoming
call, the UE receives a paging message and sends a Service
Request message (Extended Service Request in case of
CSFB calls).
