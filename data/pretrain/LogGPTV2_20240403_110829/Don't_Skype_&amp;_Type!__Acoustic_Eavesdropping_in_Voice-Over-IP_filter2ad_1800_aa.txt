ABSTRACT
Acoustic emanations of computer keyboards represent a se-
rious privacy issue. As demonstrated in prior work, physical
properties of keystroke sounds might reveal what a user is
typing. However, previous attacks assumed relatively strong
adversary models that are not very practical in many real-
world settings. Such strong models assume: (i) adversary’s
physical proximity to the victim, (ii) precise proﬁling of the
victim’s typing style and keyboard, and/or (iii) signiﬁcant
amount of victim’s typed information (and its corresponding
sounds) available to the adversary.
This paper presents and explores a new keyboard acous-
tic eavesdropping attack that involves Voice-over-IP (VoIP),
called Skype & Type (S&T), while avoiding prior strong ad-
versary assumptions. This work is motivated by the simple
observation that people often engage in secondary activities
(including typing) while participating in VoIP calls. As ex-
pected, VoIP software acquires and faithfully transmits all
sounds, including emanations of pressed keystrokes, which
can include passwords and other sensitive information. We
show that one very popular VoIP software (Skype) conveys
enough audio information to reconstruct the victim’s input
– keystrokes typed on the remote keyboard. Our results
demonstrate that, given some knowledge on the victim’s
typing style and keyboard model, the attacker attains top-5
accuracy of 91.7% in guessing a random key pressed by the
victim. Furthermore, we demonstrate that S&T is robust to
various VoIP issues (e.g., Internet bandwidth ﬂuctuations
and presence of voice over keystrokes), thus conﬁrming fea-
sibility of this attack. Finally, it applies to other popular
VoIP software, such as Google Hangouts.

and messages. Protecting such sensitive data by encryp-
tion is a common approach to prevent unauthorized access
and disclosure. However, there is no protection if data is
leaked before encryption. In fact, eavesdropping on physical
signals, such as acoustic or electromagnetic emanations, is
one way to recover either: (1) clear-text data before encryp-
tion, e.g., during its input or visualization, or (2) encryption
keys, e.g., during data encryption and decryption. Indeed,
the history of eavesdropping on physical signals dates back
to 1943, when a Bell engineer discovered that an oscilloscope
can retrieve the plain-text from electromagnetic emanations
of a Bell Telephone model 131-B2 – a mixing device used by
the US Army to encrypt communications [9].
A common target for physical eavesdropping attacks are
I/O peripherals, such as keyboards, mice, touch-screens and
printers. Examples of prior physical eavesdropping attacks
include: electromagnetic emanations of keyboards [27], videos
of users typing on a keyboard [4] or a touch-screen [25], and
keyboard acoustic emanations [3]. The research community
invested a lot of eﬀort into studying keyboard acoustic em-
anations and demonstrated that it is a very serious privacy
issue. A successful acoustic side-channel attack allows an ad-
versary to learn what a victim is typing, based on the sound
produced by keystrokes. Typically, sounds are recorded ei-
ther directly, using microphones [3, 11, 12, 5, 32, 15, 28,
31, 19], or by exploiting various sensors (e.g., accelerome-
ters [18, 30]) to re-construct the same acoustic information.
Once collected, the audio stream is typically analyzed using
techniques, such as supervised [3, 11, 12, 19] and unsuper-
vised [32, 5] machine learning, or triangulation [15, 28, 31].
The ﬁnal result is a full or partial reconstruction of the vic-
tim’s input.
It appears that all previous attacks require a compromised
(i.e., controlled by the adversary) microphone near the vic-
tim’s keyboard [3, 11, 12, 19, 5, 15, 28, 31]. We believe
that this requirement limits applicability of such attacks,
thus reducing their real-world feasibility. Although universal
popularity of smartphones might ease placement of a com-
promised microphone (e.g., the one in the attacker’s smart-
phone) close to the victim, the adversary still needs to either
physically position and/or control it. Moreover, some pre-
vious approaches are even more restrictive, requiring: (i)
lots of training information to cluster [5], thus necessitating
long-term collection of keystroke sounds, or (ii) precise pro-
ﬁling of the victim’s typing style and keyboard [3, 11, 12,
19].
703In this paper, we present and explore a new keyboard
acoustic eavesdropping attack that: (1) does not require the
adversary to control a microphone near the victim, and (2)
works with a limited amount of keystroke data. We call it
Skype & Type attack, or S&T attack for short1. As a ba-
sis for this attack, we exploit Voice-over-IP (VoIP), one of
the most popular and pervasive voice communication tech-
nologies used by great multitudes of people throughout the
world. We premise our work on a very simple observation
and a hypothesis:
People involved in VoIP calls often engage in secondary
activities, such as: writing email, contributing their“wis-
dom”to social networks, reading news, watching videos,
and even writing research papers. Many of these activ-
ities involve using the keyboard (e.g., entering a pass-
word). VoIP software automatically acquires all acoustic
emanations, including those of the keyboard, and trans-
mits them to all other parties involved in the call. If one
of these parties is malicious, it can determine what the
user typed based on keystroke sounds.
We believe this work is both timely and important, espe-
cially, due to growing pervasiveness of VoIP software2. Thus,
remote keyboard acoustic eavesdropping attacks, if shown to
be realistic, should concern every VoIP user. Prior studies
[3, 11, 12, 19, 5, 15, 28, 31] have not considered either the
setting of our attack, or the features of VoIP software. In
particular, VoIP software performs a number of transforma-
tions on the sound before transmitting it over the Internet,
e.g., downsample, approximation, compression, and disrup-
tion of the stereo information by mixing the sound into a
single channel. Such transformations have not been con-
sidered in the past.
In fact, for some prior results, these
transformations conﬂict with the assumptions, e.g., [15, 28,
31] require stereo information for the recorded audio stream.
Therefore, conclusions from these results are largely inappli-
cable to S&T attack.
Expected Contributions:
• We demonstrate S&T attack based on (remote) key-
board acoustic eavesdropping over VoIP software, with
the goal of recovering text typed by the user during a
VoIP call with the attacker. S&T attack can also re-
cover random text, such as randomly generated pass-
words or PINs. We take advantage of spectral features
of keystroke sounds and analyze them using supervised
machine learning algorithms.
• We evaluate S&T attack over a very popular VoIP soft-
ware: Skype. We designed a set of attack scenar-
ios that we consider to be more realistic than those
used in prior results on keyboard acoustic eavesdrop-
ping. We show that S&T attack is highly accurate
with minimal proﬁling of the victim’s typing style and
keyboard.
It remains quite accurate even if neither
proﬁling is available to the adversary. Our results
show that S&T attack is very feasible, and applica-
ble to real-world settings under realistic assumptions.
It allows the adversary to recover, with high accuracy,
typed (English) text, and to greatly speed up brute-
force cracking of random passwords. Moreover, pre-

users [20].
liminary experiments with Google Hangouts indicate
that it is likely susceptible to S&T attack as well.
• We show, via extensive experiments, that S&T attack
is robust to VoIP-related issues, such as limited avail-
able bandwidth that degrades call quality, as well as
human speech over keystroke sounds.
• Based on the insights from the design and evaluation
phases of this work, we propose some tentative coun-
termeasures to S&T and similar attacks that exploit
spectral properties of keystroke sounds.

2. RELATED WORK
Eavesdropping on keyboard input is an active and pop-
ular area of research. This section begins by overviewing
attacks that rely strictly on acoustic emanations to recover
the victim’s typed text and then summarizes results that
study eavesdropping on other emanations, such as the WiFi
signal, and surface vibrations.
However, there appears to be no prior research literature
on taking advantage of acoustic emanations over the net-
work, particularly over the Internet, to reconstruct keyboard
input — which is instead the contribution of our work.
Attacks Using Sound Emanations. Research on key-
board acoustic eavesdropping started with the seminal pa-
per of Asonov and Agrawal [3] who showed that, by training
a neural network on a speciﬁc keyboard, good performance
can be achieved in eavesdropping on the input to the same
keyboard, or keyboards of the same model. This work also
investigated the reasons for this attack and discovered that
the plate beneath the keyboard (where the keys hit the sen-
sors) has a drum-like behavior. This causes the sound pro-
duced by diﬀerent keys to be slightly distinct. Subsequent
eﬀorts can be divided based on whether they use statistical
properties of the sound spectrum or timing information.
Approaches that use statistical properties of the spectrum
typically apply machine learning, both supervised [3, 11, 12,
19] and unsupervised [5, 32] versions.
Supervised learning techniques require many labeled sam-
ples and are highly dependent on: (1) the speciﬁc keyboard
used for training [3], and (2) the typing style [11, 12]. Such
techniques use Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) coeﬃcients
and neural networks to recover text that can also be random.
Overall, supervised learning approaches yield very high ac-
curacy. However, this comes at the price of strong assump-
tions on how the data is collected: obtaining labeled samples
of the acoustic emanations of the victim on his keyboard can
be diﬃcult or unrealistic.
Unsupervised learning approaches can cluster together keys
from sounds, or generate sets of constraints between diﬀerent
key-presses. It is feasible to cluster key sounds and assign
labels to the clusters by using relative letter frequency of
the input language [32]. It is also possible to generate sets
of constraints from recorded sounds and select words from
704a dictionary that match these constraints [5]. Unsupervised
learning techniques have the advantage that they do not
require ground truth. However, they make strong assump-
tions on user input, such as obtaining many samples, i.e.,
emanations corresponding to a long text [32], or requiring
the targets to be dictionary words [5]. They are less eﬀective
when keyboard input is random.
An alternative approach involves analyzing timing infor-
mation. One convenient way to exploit timing information
is using multiple microphones, such as the ones on mobile
phones [15, 28, 31], and analyze the Time Diﬀerence of Ar-
rival (TDoA) information to triangulate the position of the
pressed key. Such techniques diﬀer mostly in whether they
require a training phase [28], and rely on one [15] or more [31]
mobile phones.
Attacks Using Other Emanations. Another body of
work focused on keyboard eavesdropping via non-acoustic
side-channels.
Typing on a keyboard causes its electrical components to
emit electromagnetic waves, and it is possible to collect such
waves, to recover the original keystrokes [27]. Furthermore,
typing causes vibrations of the surface under the keyboard.
