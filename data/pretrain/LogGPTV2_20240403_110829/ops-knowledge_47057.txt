User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Is Apache mod_evasive has same function as Lighttpd mod_evasive? Apache mod_evasive description:


  When possible attacks are detected, mod_evasive will block the traffic from the source for a specific duration of time, while reports abuses via email and syslog facilities. Or administrators can configure mod_evasive to talk to iptables, ipchains, firewalls, routers, and etc. to build a comprehensive DDOS prevention system for the high traffic busy web server.


But for Lighttpd mod_evasive, I still not clear about the function. The Lighttpd mod_evasive docs also not give details about it.

I just need to protect from HTTP DoS or DDoS (Denial of Service) attack.

Can Lighttpd mod_evasive block the traffic from the source for a specific duration of time?

Assistant: The documentation for lighttpd's mod_evasive clearly states its purpose:


  mod_evasive is a very simplistic module to limit connections per IP.


It is not really comparable to mod_evasive for Apache httpd since lighttpd's mod_evasive only limits the connection-count per IP address (client). Apache httpd's mod_evasive can do much more.

You could build something similar to Apache httpd's mod_evasive or mod_security with lighttpd's mod_magnet, though.
