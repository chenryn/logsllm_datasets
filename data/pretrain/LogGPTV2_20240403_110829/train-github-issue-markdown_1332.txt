 **Chris Beams** opened **SPR-5113** and commented
The following paragraph is repeated twice in the javadoc for
AbstractMessageListenerContainer:
  * NOTE: The default behavior of this message listener container is to
  * never propagate an exception thrown by a message listener up to the
  * JMS provider. Instead, it will log any such exception at the error level and
  * rollback the active transaction if there is one. This means that from the
  * perspective of the attendant JMS provider no listener will ever fail.
* * *
**Affects:** 2.0.8, 2.5.5
**Backported to:** 2.0.9
