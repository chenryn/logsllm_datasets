      "False",
      "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components of the log message:\n   - The log message starts with \"SSLVPN/6/SSLVPN_CFG_CTX_WEBPAGECUST_FAIL:\", indicating a specific event or error.\n   - The message describes a failure to specify a template for SSL VPN webpage customization in a certain context.\n   \n2. Determine the severity based on the key components:\n   - The presence of \"FAIL\" in the log message suggests that an error occurred.\n   - The log level \"6\" might indicate a higher severity level, often associated with errors.\n   \n3. Compare the identified severity to the criteria:\n   - Warnings and informational messages typically indicate potential issues or events that need attention but are not critical.\n   - Errors and faults are more serious and often require immediate attention.\n   \n4. Conclude based on the comparison:\n   - Since the log message indicates a failure and uses a log level that suggests a higher severity, it is classified as an error.\n</solutions>\n<answer> True </answer>"

    "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components of the log message:\n   - The log message is \"SSLVPN/6/SSLVPN_CFG_CTX_WEBPAGECUST_FAIL: Failed to specify template [STRING] for SSL VPN webpage customization in context [STRING].\"\n   - The phrase \"Failed to specify template\" suggests an action did not succeed.\n\n2. Determine the severity based on the key components:\n   - The presence of \"FAIL\" in the log message indicates a failure, which typically points to an error.\n   - However, it is important to consider the context and whether this failure actually impacts the operation or functionality of the VPN.\n\n3. Compare the identified severity to the criteria:\n   - In this case, the log message does not indicate a critical or severe fault; instead, it describes a failure in customization, which might not affect the overall operation of the SSL VPN.\n   - The context of webpage customization might simply indicate an informational message regarding a failed configuration rather than an operational error.\n\n4. Conclude based on the comparison:\n   - Given that the failure pertains to template specification for customization rather than the operation of the VPN itself, it suggests that this is more of an informational warning rather than a critical error.\n   - Thus, it should be classified as non-critical and the output should be False.\n</solutions>\n<answer> False </answer>"
