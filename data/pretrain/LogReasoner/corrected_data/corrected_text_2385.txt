    "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components of the log message: The log message indicates that a user changed their password due to it being about to expire. \n2. Assess the implication of the action: Changing a password due to expiration is a proactive measure to maintain security and integrity, rather than a response to an error or a warning.\n3. Evaluate the severity level: The phrase \"changed the password because it was about to expire\" suggests it is an action taken to prevent a future issue rather than indicating an existing fault or warning.\n4. Reconsider the classification: However, let's pause and consider what we know so far. The action of changing a password due to expiration is significant because it indicates potential security risks if not addressed. \n5.
