      "L3/2/IFINDEX_STATIS_NORES:Operation failed on [string] because of insufficient resources.",
      "Failed to learn a new non-host route because of insufficient VN   index resources on the card.",
      "False",
      "<solutions> \n1. Analyze the log entry: The log entry \"L3/2/IFINDEX_STATIS_NORES:Operation failed on [string] because of insufficient resources.\" indicates that an operation failed due to a lack of resources, specifically related to insufficient index resources on the card for the operation \"learn a new non-host route.\"\n2. Analyze the provided description: The description \"Failed to learn a new non-host route because of insufficient VN index resources on the card.\" specifies that the operation of learning a new non-host route was unsuccessful due to a lack of VN (Virtual Network) index resources on the card.\n3. Compare the log entry and the description: Both the log and the description refer to the failure of learning a new non-host route and attribute this failure to insufficient resources, specifically index resources. The log uses a general term \"insufficient resources,\" while the description specifies \"VN index resources.\"\n4. Determine if the description accurately reflects the log entry: The description provides a detailed explanation of the specific type of resources (VN index) that led to the failure, which aligns with the general statement in the log about insufficient resources.\n</solutions>\n<answer> True </answer>"

    "<solutions> \n1. Analyze the log entry: The log entry \"L3/2/IFINDEX_STATIS_NORES:Operation failed on [string] because of insufficient resources.\" indicates that an operation failed due to a lack of resources. However, it does not specify what type of resource was insufficient.\n2. Analyze the provided description: The description \"Failed to learn a new non-host route because of insufficient VN index resources on the card.\" specifies that the failure involved insufficient VN (Virtual Network) index resources.\n3. Compare the log entry and the description: While both the log and the description reference a failure due to insufficient resources, the log does not mention \"VN index resources\" specifically. It simply states \"insufficient resources,\" which could refer to any type of resource, not specifically VN index resources.\n4. Determine if the description accurately reflects the log entry: Because the log entry lacks specificity regarding the type of resources, the description introduces a specific type (VN index) that is not mentioned in the log. Thus, the description does not accurately reflect the log entry.\n</solutions>\n<answer> False </answer>"
