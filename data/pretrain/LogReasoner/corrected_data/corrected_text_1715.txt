    "<solutions> \n1. Analyzing the log entry: The log entry mentions multiple instances of `java.lang.IllegalStateException` and `java.net.SocketException: Broken pipe`. Initially, this might lead us to believe that these exceptions indicate issues within the system's state and network connectivity.\n2. Determining the category: However, let's pause and consider what we know so far. The log states that the system is encountering `IllegalStateException`, which typically indicates that the client is not in a usable state. While this sounds concerning, we need to evaluate the overall context in which these logs appear.\n3. Checking against the ground-truth: The ground-truth categorizes this log entry as \"normal.\" This necessitates a closer examination of what constitutes \"normal\" versus \"abnormal\" behavior in this specific context.\n4. Using the exclusion method: \n   - First, we can exclude the notion that multiple `IllegalStateException` instances automatically mean that the log is abnormal. \n   - Next, we consider that the log might be handling exceptions that are part of routine operations, which do not necessarily indicate a failure of the entire system.\n   - Finally, we reflect on the possibility that the errors mentioned might relate to transient issues that do not impede overall functionality, thereby fitting within a normal operational context.\n5. Conclusion: Given this thorough re-evaluation and the confirmation from the ground-truth, the log entry should be categorized as \"normal.\" \n</solutions> \n<answer> normal </answer>"
