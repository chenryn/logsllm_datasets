      "LSPM/4/TRAPSUPPRESS:In the latest [value] seconds, the number of times that the trap of [feature-name] is suppressed is [times].",
      "True",
      "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components of the log message:\n   - The log message is from the LSPM subsystem.\n   - It indicates that a trap has been suppressed.\n   - It specifies the number of times this suppression has occurred within a certain time frame.\n\n2. Determine the severity level:\n   - The term \"TRAPSUPPRESS\" suggests that the trap is being suppressed, which implies a deviation from normal operation.\n   - However, the message is more about a monitoring or operational detail rather than an immediate fault or error.\n   - The use of \"In the latest [value] seconds\" indicates that this is a periodic monitoring message and not an immediate alert.\n\n3. Conclude the severity:\n   - While the suppression of traps could be indicative of an issue, the message itself is providing a status update rather than an error or critical fault.\n   - It is more of an informational message that could be useful for monitoring and troubleshooting but does not indicate a critical fault.\n\n4. Final decision:\n   - Given that the message is primarily informational and not indicating an error or critical fault, it should be classified as a non-error message.\n</solutions>\n<answer> False </answer>"

    "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components of the log message:\n   - The log message originates from the LSPM subsystem.\n   - It indicates the suppression of a trap related to a specific feature, along with the frequency of this suppression over a defined time period.\n\n2. Determine the severity level:\n   - The term \"TRAPSUPPRESS\" typically signals that something unusual may be occurring regarding the monitoring of events, as traps are usually meant to alert system operators to issues.\n   - Even though the message discusses a suppression, this suggests that the system is actively managing potentially excessive alerts, which could indicate a fault.\n\n3. Conclude the severity:\n   - The language used in the log, especially mentioning the suppression of traps, implies that the event is significant enough to warrant attention. It indicates that traps are not just being ignored but are being actively suppressed, which can point to underlying issues.\n   - Therefore, this is not merely an informational message but carries a severity that indicates potential problems in the system.\n\n4. Final decision:\n   - Considering the context of trap suppression, which indicates that the system is attempting to manage alerts related to abnormal situations, this log should indeed be classified as indicating a warning or error condition rather than being labeled a non-error message. Thus, the output should be True.\n</solutions>\n<answer> True </answer>"
