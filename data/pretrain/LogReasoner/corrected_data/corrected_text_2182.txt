      "SSH/4/IP_UNLOCKED: IP was unlocked. (IpAddress=[IpAddress], VpnName=[VpnName]) In LS mode, this log is supported by both the admin LS and service LSs.",
      "True",
      "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components of the log message: The log message is \"SSH/4/IP_UNLOCKED: IP was unlocked. (IpAddress=[IpAddress], VpnName=[VpnName])\". The key components are the log level (4), the event (IP_UNLOCKED), and the context of the event.\n2. Determine the severity level: The log level 4 typically indicates an informational message in many logging systems. The event \"IP was unlocked\" suggests a change in the state of an IP address from locked to unlocked, which is generally a non-critical event.\n3. Consider the context: The log mentions that in LS mode, it is supported by both the admin LS and service LSs, indicating that this is a standard operation rather than an error or warning.\n</solutions>\n<answer> False </answer>"

    "<solutions> \n1. Begin by identifying the key components of the log message: The log message is \"SSH/4/IP_UNLOCKED: IP was unlocked. (IpAddress=[IpAddress], VpnName=[VpnName])\". The key components are the log level (4), the event (IP_UNLOCKED), and the context of the event.\n2. Determine the severity level: The log level 4 typically indicates an informational message in many logging systems. The event \"IP was unlocked\" suggests a change in the state of an IP address from locked to unlocked, which could be interpreted as a non-critical event.\n3. Consider the context: The log mentions that this message is generated in LS mode, supported by both the admin LS and service LSs, which seems to indicate normal operational behavior.\n4. But, wait, let’s pause and examine this more carefully. The phrase \"IP was unlocked\" implies an action that may have operational significance, particularly in a security context. \n5. Given the context of unlocking an IP, this indicates a potential security-related change that should be monitored.\n6. Therefore, \"IP was unlocked\" shouldn’t be classified purely as informational, but rather as a warning that could lead to further scrutiny, as it reflects a significant state change.\n</solutions> \n<answer> True </answer>"
