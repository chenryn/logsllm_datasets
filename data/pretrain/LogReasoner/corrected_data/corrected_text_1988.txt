    "<solutions> \n1. Analyze the log entry: \"im_request, event <*> taskid 1 not found\"\n2. Determine the context: This log entry refers to a situation in which a request was made for a task with a specific ID (taskid 1), but the system could not find this task.\n3. Evaluate the nature of the log: The phrase \"taskid 1 not found\" suggests that there was an attempt to access a task that does not exist. This could indicate a problem, but we need to consider the operational context.\n4. While a missing task might seem like an error, it's important to determine if this situation is expected in the system's workflow. There may be instances where tasks do not exist due to valid reasons like deletion or completion.\n5. Wait a second, let’s ensure this is right. Analyzing further, if the system is designed to handle requests for non-existent tasks gracefully by logging them without causing disruption, then this situation may not constitute an abnormal operation.\n6. Thus, the absence of taskid 1 could reflect normal behavior if it's a known condition within the system's operational scope.\n7. After considering this context, it’s possible that this log entry should indeed be categorized as \"normal\" because it reflects expected behavior within the system under certain circumstances.\n</solutions> \n<answer> normal </answer>"
