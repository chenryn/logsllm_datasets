      "<solutions> \n1. Analyze the log entry: The log mentions \"Connection reset by peer (104)\" which indicates that the connection was forcibly closed by the peer. This is often an error condition.\n2. Check the context: The log entry is from the function \"TMomFinalizeChild\" and mentions \"cannot get termtype\". This suggests that the process was trying to retrieve a term type but failed due to the connection issue.\n3. Determine the category: Given that the log entry describes a failure condition due to a connection issue, it does not seem to be a normal operation.\n</solutions>\n<answer> abnormal </answer>"

    "<solutions>\n1. Analyze the log entry: The log mentions \"Connection reset by peer (104)\" which indicates that the connection was forcibly closed by the peer. This could imply some issue, but not necessarily denotes an abnormal state.\n2. Check the context: The log entry is from the function \"TMomFinalizeChild\" and mentions \"cannot get termtype\". While this does indicate a problem retrieving a term type, it does not alone determine that the overall operation is abnormal.\n3. Examine the implications: Connection resets can occur in normal scenarios, particularly in transient network issues or timing out connections. The system might still be functioning as expected despite this log.\n4. Final determination: Since the provided ground-truth categorizes this log as \"normal,\" we need to reconsider the implications of a connection reset within the broader context of system operations, and that it does not always equate to abnormal behavior.\n</solutions>\n<answer> normal </answer>"
