      "SSHS/6/SSHS_SRV_UNAVAILABLE:The [STRING] server is disabled or the [STRING] service type is    not supported.",
      "False",
      "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components of the log message: The log message is \"SSHS/6/SSHS_SRV_UNAVAILABLE:The [STRING] server is disabled or the [STRING] service type is not supported.\"\n2. Determine the severity level based on the components: \n   - The log message does not explicitly state \"warning\", \"error\", or \"critical\".\n   - However, the fact that the server is disabled or a service type is not supported indicates that this is a functional issue that prevents normal operation.\n3. Classify the message: Given that the server being disabled or the service type not being supported is a functional issue, it is likely to be a warning or error.\n4. Conclude the severity: Since the log suggests a functional issue that could affect service availability, it is classified as a warning.\n</solutions>\n<answer> True </answer>"

Determine the severity level based on the components: \n   - The log message does not explicitly state \"warning\", \"error\", or \"critical\".\n   - Let's analyze the implications of the server being disabled or unsupported. This situation might lead to service unavailability, but it does not inherently indicate an error; instead, it suggests a state where the service is simply not operational.\n3. Classify the message: The log is not reporting an active error; rather, it indicates a state of functionality that is not currently viable. The terms used do not signify a direct fault, but rather a configuration or status issue.\n4. Conclude the severity: Since the log indicates a service that is not operational but does not classify this as an error or warning, it should be regarded as an informational message.\n</solutions> \n<answer> False </answer>"
