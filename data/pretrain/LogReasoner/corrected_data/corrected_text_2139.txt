    "<solutions> \n1. Analyzing the log entry \"minus <*>\" to determine if it is normal or abnormal.\n2.

The term \"minus\" in a log typically indicates the removal or subtraction of something.\n4. However, the asterisk (*) and star (*) symbols are often used to denote wildcard characters or placeholders in log entries.\n5. So far, the reasoning seems valid; however, we need to consider more about what constitutes a \"normal\" log entry specifically.\n6. Wait, something seems off. Letâ€™s pause and consider what we know so far. \n7. The context of \"minus <*>\" suggests that it may represent a legitimate action related to a system process, where something is being removed or dereferenced.\n8. The use of \"<*>\" here implies that the log entry does not provide specific details but follows a pattern that is acceptable in many logging systems.\n9. Therefore, rather than concluding that it is abnormal due to lack of clarity, we should analyze if \"minus <*>\" is a common type of log entry that signifies normal operations.\n10. Given that the Ground-truth indicates this log entry is classified as normal, it stands to reason that it fits within expected logging behavior. Thus, we would categorize it as \"normal\" based on this understanding.\n</solutions> \n<answer> normal </answer>"
