      "<solutions> \n1. Analyze the log entry: The log entry states \"not 100% native mode: #43# probe irqs later\". This suggests that the system is not fully in native mode and will probe irqs later.\n2. Determine the context: The term \"native mode\" typically refers to the most optimized or default state for a system, and \"probe irqs later\" suggests that the system will perform an action at a later time rather than immediately.\n3. Evaluate for abnormalities: The fact that the system is not in 100% native mode and will probe irqs later could indicate that there is something unusual or non-optimal about the system's current state.\n4.

Categorize: Given the indication of non-100% native mode and the need to probe irqs later, this log entry suggests an abnormal state.\n5. Wait, this doesn’t seem right. Let’s pause and consider this: The phrase \"not 100% native mode\" could imply a temporary state that the system is handling, and \"probe irqs later\" does not necessarily indicate a failure or issue. It might simply reflect a routine operation.\n6. Upon reassessment, many systems operate efficiently even when not in 100% native mode, especially if actions are scheduled to probe later. \n7. Therefore, this log entry may actually reflect a normal operational procedure rather than an abnormal one.\n</solutions>\n<answer> normal </answer>"
