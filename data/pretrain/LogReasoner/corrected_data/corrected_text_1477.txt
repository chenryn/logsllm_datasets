      "<solutions> \n1. Analyze the log entry: The log entry \"EIGRP/5/RID_CHANGE:EIGRP [UINT32]: New elected router ID will take effect after EIGRP address family is reset.\" indicates that a new router ID has been elected for an EIGRP router, and this new ID will take effect only after the EIGRP address family is reset.\n2. Analyze the description: The description states \"A change of interface IP address causes the change of router ID for the EIGRP router. You must restart the EIGRP IPv4 address family to make the new router ID take effect.\" This description suggests that a change in the IP address of an interface leads to a change in the router ID, and the new router ID will take effect after restarting the EIGRP IPv4 address family.\n3. Compare the log entry and the description: The log entry mentions the new elected router ID will take effect after resetting the EIGRP address family, while the description suggests the change in router ID is due to a change in the interface IP address and requires restarting the EIGRP IPv4 address family to make the new router ID take effect.\n4. Determine if the description is a valid explanation: The log entry does not specify the cause of the new router ID change (whether it is due to a change in the interface IP address or some other reason), and it only states that the new ID will take effect after resetting the EIGRP address family. The description provides a specific cause (change in interface IP address) and an additional detail (the need to restart the EIGRP IPv4 address family), which are not directly supported by the log entry.\n</solutions>\n<answer> False </answer>"

Compare the log entry and the description: The log entry mentions that a new elected router ID will take effect after resetting the EIGRP address family. The description adds a specific cause (change in interface IP address) for the new router ID, which is not explicitly mentioned in the log entry.\n\n4. Wait a second, letâ€™s ensure this is right. Calculating carefully: The key difference lies in the causation implied by the description. The log indicates a procedural step regarding the new router ID without specifying the root cause of the change. However, it does state that the new ID will take effect after a reset. \n\n5. Reflecting on the key points: The description, while not directly supported by the log, provides plausible context for the new router ID change, specifically mentioning that a change in interface IP address can lead to this change. The log entry does not contradict this and essentially outlines the process for implementing the change. \n\n6. Since the description aligns with the general implications of the log entry and does not present conflicting information, it can be regarded as a valid explanation of the log entry.\n</solutions>\n<answer> True </answer>"
