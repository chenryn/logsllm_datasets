      "ISIS/6/CREATE_ONBR_TLV_FAIL:ISIS [process-id] failed to add original-system neighbor TLV to virtual-system in Level-[level]. (NeighborId=[STRING])",
      "False",
      "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components of the log message:\n   - Prefix: ISIS/6/CREATE_ONBR_TLV_FAIL\n   - Message: ISIS [process-id] failed to add original-system neighbor TLV to virtual-system in Level-[level]. (NeighborId=[STRING])\n2. Analyze the prefix and message:\n   - The prefix \"CREATE_ONBR_TLV_FAIL\" suggests a failure in creating or adding a TLV (Type-Length-Value) in the ISIS protocol, which is a routing protocol.\n   - The message indicates a failure to add a specific TLV related to neighbors in a virtual system, which is a critical operation for maintaining routing information.\n3. Determine the severity:\n   - The term \"failed\" in the message indicates that an error has occurred.\n   - The failure to add a necessary TLV can disrupt the proper functioning of the ISIS protocol, leading to routing issues.\n4. Conclusion:\n   - The log message indicates an error that needs to be addressed to maintain the proper operation of the ISIS protocol.\n</solutions>\n<answer> True </answer>"

    "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components of the log message:\n   - Prefix: ISIS/6/CREATE_ONBR_TLV_FAIL\n   - Message: ISIS [process-id] failed to add original-system neighbor TLV to virtual-system in Level-[level]. (NeighborId=[STRING])\n   \n2. Analyze the prefix and message:\n   - The prefix \"CREATE_ONBR_TLV_FAIL\" does indeed suggest a failure related to creating or adding a TLV in the ISIS protocol. \n\n3. However, I notice that while the term \"failed\" indicates a problem, the context of the message must be understood more deeply. \n\n4. Wait a second, let’s ensure this is right. Calculating carefully:\n   - The log message specifically states that there was a failure to add a TLV, but does not indicate that this failure impacts the actual routing operations adversely. It may be an informational message indicating that the system attempted an action but did not succeed.\n\n5. Review the implications of \"CREATE_ONBR_TLV_FAIL\":\n   - While it indicates a failure, it doesn’t necessarily signify a critical error that would impair the system’s functionality. It might just reflect an operation that was not executed successfully without causing an immediate operational fault.\n\n6. Conclusion:\n   - Therefore, the log message suggests that there is no immediate operational fault but merely a failed attempt to add a TLV. Thus, it does not warrant an error status.\n\n</solutions> \n<answer> False </answer>"
