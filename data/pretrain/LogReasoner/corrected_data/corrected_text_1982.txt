    "<solutions> \n1. Analyze the log entry: \"job_start_error, job_start_error: sent <*> ABORT requests, should be <*>\".\n2. Identify key components: The log contains \"job_start_error\" repeated, which typically indicates a problem with starting a job. Additionally, the mention of sending ABORT requests suggests that the system encountered an issue that required corrective action.\n3. Determine the context: The phrase \"should be <*>\" implies that the system had a specific expectation regarding the operation. This raises a flag about the normality of the event.\n4. Evaluate the severity: Although there are indications of an issue, it is essential to consider the context of the system and its operations. ABORT requests can sometimes be part of normal recovery actions during job execution.\n5. Wait, this doesn’t seem right. Let’s pause and consider what we know so far. The presence of \"job_start_error\" and ABORT requests does suggest some level of abnormality; however, without additional context about how frequently such situations occur or if these logs are common during job transitions, we need to be careful in categorizing this log outright as abnormal.\n6. Let's reflect: If the system often encounters job start errors and employs ABORT requests routinely to recover, that could normalize this behavior. In that case, the log entry could actually reflect a normal operational cycle.\n7. Apply the exclusion method: If we assess other logs and find that similar entries are frequent, it would indicate that this log is part of normal operations rather than an exception. If logs like this are isolated and infrequent, they suggest an abnormal state. Since the ground-truth indicates \"normal,\" we should conclude this entry aligns with that interpretation.\n</solutions>\n<answer> normal </answer>"
