      "PKTCPT/6/PKTCPT_OPERATION_TIMEOUT:Failed to start or continue packet capture. Reason: Operation   timed out.",
      "False",
      "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components of the log message: The log message includes \"PKTCPT/6/PKTCPT_OPERATION_TIMEOUT\", which indicates a specific type of timeout error in packet capture operations.\n2. Determine the severity level: The term \"timeout\" suggests that the operation did not complete within the expected time frame, which typically indicates a problem that may require attention but does not necessarily indicate a critical fault.\n3. Assess the context: The phrase \"Failed to start or continue packet capture\" implies that the packet capture operation was interrupted or did not complete successfully, which could lead to issues in network monitoring or analysis.\n4. Compare with provided examples: This log message aligns with the \"Warning\" category from the examples provided, as it indicates a potential issue that may need to be addressed but is not critical.\n</solutions>\n<answer> True </answer>"

    "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components of the log message: The log message \"PKTCPT/6/PKTCPT_OPERATION_TIMEOUT:Failed to start or continue packet capture. Reason: Operation timed out.\" contains the phrase \"Failed to start or continue packet capture,\" which indicates a problem with the packet capture operation.\n2. Determine the severity level: The term \"Operation timed out\" typically suggests there was an issue, but it does not automatically classify it as an error needing immediate attention. It might indicate a temporary state rather than a critical failure.\n3. Assess the context: While the log suggests that there was a failure to complete an operation, it does not explicitly indicate a fault that may lead to serious issues. Instead, this can be seen as an operational message that informs about a timeout without implying that the overall system is in a faulty state.\n4. Compare with provided examples: If we analyze similar logs, the phrase \"operation timed out\" without further critical ramifications is often categorized as an informational message. Thus, it's not necessarily an error or warning but simply indicates a timing issue in the operation.\n5. Conclude: Given that the log does not indicate a critical fault and instead suggests the failure of a non-essential operation, it aligns with the classification of an informational or non-error log.\n</solutions> \n<answer> False </answer>"
