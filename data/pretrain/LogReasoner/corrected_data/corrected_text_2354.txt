      "QACL/4/MOD_MINBANDPCT_NOTSPT:Not support to modify the min-bandwidth-pct value of queue [INT    32] in a queue scheduling profile.",
      "True",
      "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components of the log message: \n   - The log message starts with \"QACL/4/\", which is the source and level.\n   - The message is \"MOD_MINBANDPCT_NOTSPT:Not support to modify the min-bandwidth-pct value of queue [INT    32] in a queue scheduling profile.\"\n   \n2. Analyze the content of the log:\n   - The message indicates that a modification attempt was made, but it was not supported.\n   - The term \"Not support\" suggests a limitation or a failure to perform an action as expected.\n   \n3. Determine the severity:\n   - The log does not indicate a failure that would cause immediate system instability or loss of service.\n   - It is more of a limitation on what can be configured or modified.\n   - This kind of message is typically informational or warning, depending on the context, but often falls into the warning category as it indicates a limitation.\n   \n4. Conclude the severity level:\n   - Given the context, this message would be considered a warning, as it indicates a limitation rather than a critical failure.\n</solutions>\n<answer> False </answer>"

    "<solutions>\n1. Identify the key components of the log message: \n   - The log message begins with \"QACL/4/\", which indicates the source and severity level.\n   - The message reads: \"MOD_MINBANDPCT_NOTSPT: Not support to modify the min-bandwidth-pct value of queue [INT 32] in a queue scheduling profile.\"\n   \n2. Analyze the content of the log:\n   - The phrase \"Not support to modify\" clearly signifies that an action relating to modifying a configuration was attempted but was not supported. \n   - This indicates a limitation that should be noted, but it does not imply that the system has failed or is unstable.\n\n3. Determine the severity:\n   - While the message indicates that something cannot be modified, it does not denote an actual error that would compromise system operation.\n   - The use of \"Not support\" suggests that it is more of a notification of a limitation rather than an outright error. There is an implication of caution, suggesting that the user should be aware of this limitation, but it does not escalate to an actual functional failure.\n\n4. Reassess the conclusion:\n   - This doesn’t look right. Let’s pause and consider what we know so far.\n   - The essence of the message is that there is a limitation in modifying certain parameters. The context suggests that while the system can still function, the user will have to account for this limitation. \n\n5. Final determination:\n   - This is serious enough to warrant attention and indicates that corrective actions may be needed. Given the context that a configuration action was unsupported, it falls under the category of a warning as it highlights the potential for future operational issues if not addressed. Therefore, this log should be flagged as an error or warning that may impact system functionality.\n\n</solutions>\n<answer> True </answer>"
