      "<solutions> \n1. The log entry is \"Out of Memory: Killed process <*> <*>\". \n2. This log indicates that the system has run out of memory and as a result, a process was terminated (killed).\n3. An out-of-memory condition is generally considered an abnormal situation in a computing environment because it usually indicates a failure to manage memory resources properly or an unexpected resource consumption by a process.\n4. Therefore, based on the given log entry, the system encountered an abnormal condition.\n</solutions>\n<answer> abnormal </answer>"

    "<solutions> \n1. The log entry is \"Out of Memory: Killed process <*> <*>\". \n2. This log indicates that the system has run out of memory and as a result, a process was terminated (killed).\n3. However, letâ€™s pause and consider what we know so far. \n4. In some systems, the out-of-memory killer is a mechanism that manages memory allocation by terminating processes to free up memory. This action can occur during normal operation under heavy load when resources are constrained. \n5. The classification of this log entry as \"normal\" or \"abnormal\" may depend on the context of the system's operation and memory management policies. \n6. Given that the log indicates a process was killed due to memory constraints but does not suggest a failure in handling memory (as it is a proactive measure), we should classify it as \"normal\" behavior in this context.\n</solutions> \n<answer> normal </answer>"
