      "<solutions> \n1. Analyze the log entry to determine if it indicates a normal or abnormal condition.\n2. The log entry \"signal_no_reset: signal 13 had flags 4000000\" suggests that a signal with ID 13 had a specific set of flags (4000000) associated with it.\n3. The term \"signal_no_reset\" is a prefix that might indicate a context or a specific type of signal handling.\n4. The flag value 4000000 in hexadecimal can be converted to decimal as 16777216, which is a specific flag value that could be part of a signal handling protocol.\n5. Without specific context about what these flags represent in the system, we need to consider the prefix \"signal_no_reset\" which might indicate a non-standard or error condition.\n6. The presence of a specific flag value (4000000) in a \"signal_no_reset\" context might suggest that this is not a typical or expected signal behavior.\n7. Given the lack of explicit error message and the context of \"no reset\" suggesting a potential issue, we lean towards classifying this as an abnormal condition.\n</solutions>\n<answer> abnormal </answer>"

    "<solutions> \n1. Analyze the log entry to determine if it indicates a normal or abnormal condition.\n2. The log entry \"signal_no_reset: signal 13 had flags 4000000\" indicates that a signal with ID 13 had a specific set of flags (4000000) associated with it.\n3. The prefix \"signal_no_reset\" may imply a specific type of signal handling in the system.\n4. The flag value 4000000 in hexadecimal translates to 16777216 in decimal. This is a specific value that could correspond to an expected signal behavior.\n5. However, we need to assess the meaning of \"signal_no_reset\" more carefully. It does not necessarily indicate an error; it might simply be a part of the signaling architecture that functions correctly without requiring a reset.\n6. The absence of an explicit error message and the context of \"signal 13 had flags 4000000\" do not inherently suggest an abnormal condition.\n7. Given the context, we should consider that a signal can operate normally even with the \"no reset\" indication, especially if no errors are reported.\n8. Therefore, based on this analysis, we can classify this log entry as normal.\n</solutions>\n<answer> normal </answer>"
