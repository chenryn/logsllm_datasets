      "EventTrap",
      "<solutions> \n1. The log starts with \"ISIS/3/isisDatabaseOverload\" which indicates it is related to the IS-IS protocol and specifically mentions a database overload.\n2. The message states \"The overload state of IS-IS LSDB changed\" which describes a change in the state of the Link State Database (LSDB) in the IS-IS protocol.\n3. This type of message indicates an issue with the network's database management, which falls under the category of network communications.\n4. Looking at the provided list of alert types, the most appropriate category for this message is 'communicationsAlarm'.\n</solutions>\n<answer> communicationsAlarm </answer>"

    "<solutions> \n1. The log starts with \"ISIS/3/isisDatabaseOverload\", indicating it relates to the IS-IS protocol and specifically mentions a database overload.\n2. The message states \"The overload state of IS-IS LSDB changed\" which describes a change in the state of the Link State Database (LSDB) within the IS-IS protocol.\n3. Initially, this might suggest a network-related issue, but wait, this doesn’t seem right. Let’s pause and consider what we know so far.\n4. Analyzing the alert type \"isisDatabaseOverload\", it points to an event that signifies a change in status rather than an ongoing problem that disrupts communication.\n5. According to the provided categories, the term \"overload\" often relates more to alerting on the change of state rather than the presence of an ongoing problem or communications failure.\n6. The correct classification for such an alert where a change of state is indicated is \"Event Trap,\" which is meant to signify various significant occurrences in the system.\n7. Therefore, excluding the initial reasoning that categorized it as a 'communicationsAlarm', I conclude that the alert is actually an 'Event Trap'.\n</solutions> \n<answer> Event Trap </answer>"
