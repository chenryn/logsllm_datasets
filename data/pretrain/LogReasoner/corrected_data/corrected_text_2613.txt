    "<solutions> \n1. Analyze the log message to understand its content and context. The log indicates that a member port of an aggregation group has changed to an inactive state.\n2. Identify key phrases or words that indicate the severity level of the message. The phrase \"changed to the inactive state\" suggests a change in status but does not inherently indicate an error or fault.\n3. Determine if the message indicates a warning, an error, or a more serious fault. The context implies that the change is due to the link not being aggregatable, which points more towards an informational state rather than a critical issue.\n4. Based on the determined severity, it appears that this message does not indicate a fault but rather an informational message about the status of a port. Therefore, it should output False instead of True.\n</solutions> \n<answer> False </answer>"
