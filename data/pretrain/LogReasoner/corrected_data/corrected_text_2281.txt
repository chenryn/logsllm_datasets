      "PIM/4/RPF_SUPPRESS: In the VPN instance '[vpn-instance-name]', the rpf route to source ([source-address]) process was suppressed [Suppress-time] due to frequent change, and CpuUsage = [CpuUsage]. In LS mode, this log is supported only by the service LSs.",
      "True",
      "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key elements in the log: The log mentions \"rpf route to source was suppressed\" which indicates a potential issue with routing.\n2. Determine the severity: The term \"suppressed\" and the context of a routing issue suggest that this is a warning or cautionary message indicating a situation that may require attention.\n3. Check for keywords indicating error or fault: There are no explicit error or fault keywords like \"error,\" \"critical,\" or \"fault.\"\n4. Consider the context: The log provides details about the suppression process and CPU usage, which are informational for monitoring but do not indicate a severe fault.\n5. Conclude: The log is more of a warning or informational message about a routing suppression issue rather than an error or critical fault.\n</solutions>\n<answer> False </answer>"

    "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key elements in the log: The log states \"rpf route to source was suppressed,\" which suggests that there may be a problem with the routing process.\n2. Determine the severity: The term \"suppressed\" indicates a reaction to frequent changes in the routing process. This implies that while there is a change, it is being managed, which raises a concern that requires attention.\n3. Check for keywords indicating error or fault: The phrase \"suppressed\" does not indicate an error outright, but it does suggest that an issue is present that could lead to future problems if not addressed.\n4. Consider the context: The log provides additional context about CPU usage and mentions that this log is only supported by service LSs in LS mode. This context supports the idea that while not indicating an immediate critical fault, it does highlight a situation that is significant enough to warrant attention.\n5. Reflect on the implications: Given that the log relates to the management of routing, which is crucial for network operations, and that the suppression could lead to further complications, this is not simply an informational message but rather indicates a warning about a potential issue.\n6. Therefore, the correct conclusion should indicate that this log does indeed represent a warning or a fault condition that requires further investigation.\n</solutions>\n<answer> True </answer>"
