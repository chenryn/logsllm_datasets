    "<solutions> \n1. Let's start by analyzing the log entry: \"mount: <*> failed, reason given by server: Permission denied\". \n2. The message indicates a failed attempt to mount a file system or device, and the provided reason is \"Permission denied\".\n3. Normally, in a well-configured system, certain users or processes require specific permissions to perform mounting operations. \n4. However, the failure due to \"Permission denied\" does not necessarily indicate an abnormal situation. It indicates that the user or process trying to perform the operation does not have the required permissions, which could be expected behavior if it was intended.\n5. Given that in a normal operation, it's typical to have permissions checks in place, and users may encounter such a message when they attempt to perform actions without the necessary rights, this does not classify the log entry as abnormal.\n6. Thus, we should categorize this log entry as \"normal\" instead of \"abnormal\".\n</solutions>\n<answer> normal </answer>"
