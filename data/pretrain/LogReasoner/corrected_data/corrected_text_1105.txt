      "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components of the log message:\n   - The log message is \"SSH/3/hwSSHLoginFailed:Users failed to login ssh server too frequently. (failed times=[hwUserInfoLoginFailedTimes], statistic period=[hwUserInfoStatisticPeriod] minutes)\"\n   - The message indicates an issue with SSH login attempts, specifically that users are failing to log in too frequently.\n   \n2. Determine the type of alarm based on the components:\n   - The issue described is related to the operational status of the SSH service and login attempts.\n   - It indicates a problem that could affect communications, as frequent failed login attempts might prevent legitimate users from accessing the system.\n   \n3. Match the description to the provided list of alarm types:\n   - 'Event Trap' typically refers to an event that has been detected but doesn't necessarily indicate a problem.\n   - 'communicationsAlarm' suggests a problem that affects the communication or access to the system.\n   - 'qualityOfServiceAlarm' indicates issues with the quality of service, such as performance or reliability.\n   - 'processingErrorAlarm' relates to errors in processing or configuration.\n   - 'equipmentAlarm' refers to hardware issues.\n   - 'environmentalAlarm' refers to environmental conditions affecting the system.\n   \n4. Conclude based on the most fitting description:\n   - Since the issue is related to users failing to log in too frequently, which affects communication and access to the system, the most appropriate type is 'communicationsAlarm'.\n</solutions>\n<answer> communicationsAlarm </answer>"

Determine the type of alarm based on the components:\n   - The issue described is related to SSH login attempts, suggesting that there is a pattern of excessive failed attempts.\n\n3. Match the description to the provided list of alarm types:\n   - 'Event Trap' typically refers to detected events that do not signal a problem.\n   - 'communicationsAlarm' suggests a problem affecting communication or access to the system.\n   - 'qualityOfServiceAlarm' indicates issues that affect the quality or reliability of service.\n   - 'processingErrorAlarm' relates to errors in processing or configuration.\n   - 'equipmentAlarm' refers to hardware-related problems.\n   - 'environmentalAlarm' involves conditions affecting the system's environment.\n\n4. Conclude based on the most fitting description:\n   - The reasoning so far suggests that it might relate to communication. But, wait, letâ€™s pause and examine this more carefully. The log points to repeated failed login attempts, which indicates a potential issue in service quality, as the reliability of the SSH service is being compromised due to too many failures. \n\n5. Therefore, the most appropriate type of alarm is 'qualityOfServiceAlarm' since it aligns with the notion that the SSH service is not performing reliably due to frequent login failures.\n</solutions>\n<answer> qualityOfServiceAlarm </answer>"
