      "<solutions> \nTo determine if the log entry is normal or abnormal, we need to consider the context and implications of the message. The log entry states \"server 172.30.2.3 not responding, still trying\". This indicates that a server with the IP address 172.30.2.3 is not responding to requests, but the system is still attempting to establish communication with it. \n\nIn most systems, a server not responding is typically considered abnormal behavior because it disrupts normal operations. However, the fact that the system is \"still trying\" suggests an ongoing attempt to resolve the issue, which is a common behavior in network and system management.\n\nGiven that the server is not responding, this is generally an abnormal condition, but the ongoing attempt to communicate could be seen as a normal response to such an issue.\n</solutions>\n<answer> abnormal </answer>"

    "<solutions> \nTo determine if the log entry is normal or abnormal, we need to consider the context of the message. The log entry states \"server 172.30.2.3 not responding, still trying.\" At first glance, this may seem concerning since a server that is not responding can indicate a problem.\n\nHowever, letâ€™s pause and consider what we know so far. The phrase \"still trying\" indicates that the system is making ongoing attempts to establish communication with the server. This behavior is typical in many network management systems where reconnection attempts are made to handle temporary connectivity issues.\n\nNow, to accurately categorize this log entry, let's apply the exclusion method. We can exclude the possibility of it being abnormal by considering the following points:\n1. **Temporary Connectivity Issue**: It is common for servers to experience temporary unavailability. The fact that attempts are ongoing suggests that the system is designed to handle such situations.\n2. **Normal Recovery Behavior**: The ongoing attempts to reconnect imply that the system has a recovery mechanism in place, which is a standard operational procedure.\n\nBased on these reflections, we can conclude that while the server not responding could initially be alarming, the message indicates a normal operational response to a momentary issue. Therefore, the log entry should be categorized as normal.\n</solutions> \n<answer> normal </answer>"
