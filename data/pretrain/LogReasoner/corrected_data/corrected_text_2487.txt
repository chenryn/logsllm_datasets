      "NQA/6/NQA_SEVER_ADDR_UNAVAILABLE:Failed to enable the NQA server because the   listening service's IP address [STRING] is not available.",
      "False",
      "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components in the log message:\n   - The log prefix \"NQA/6\" suggests it's related to Network Quality Analysis.\n   - The message \"NQA_SEVER_ADDR_UNAVAILABLE\" indicates that the IP address for the NQA server is not available.\n   - The phrase \"Failed to enable the NQA server\" suggests an issue that prevents the server from functioning properly.\n\n2. Determine the severity based on the components:\n   - The term \"Failed\" indicates an issue that is preventing the normal operation of the system.\n   - \"NQA server is not available\" suggests that a critical component of the network quality analysis system is missing or malfunctioning, which could lead to faults in network monitoring and diagnostics.\n\n3. Classify the severity:\n   - Given that the NQA server is crucial for network quality analysis and its failure could impact the overall network health, this is classified as an error.\n</solutions>\n<answer> True </answer>"

    "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components in the log message:\n   - The log prefix \"NQA/6\" indicates it's related to Network Quality Analysis.\n   - The message \"NQA_SEVER_ADDR_UNAVAILABLE\" suggests an issue with the NQA server's IP address.\n   - The phrase \"Failed to enable the NQA server\" indicates a failure related to the server's functionality.\n\n2. Determine the severity based on the components:\n   - The term \"Failed\" suggests an issue, but it’s important to assess the context. \n   - The context here indicates that the NQA server could be unable to start due to an unavailable IP address, which is a status but does not necessarily mean there is a fault in the system itself.\n\n3. Classify the severity:\n   - While the failure to enable the server might sound critical, it’s crucial to distinguish between a fault and a service not being operational because of a configuration issue (like an IP address being unavailable).\n   - The message does not indicate that there is a system-wide error or fault, but rather that a specific service cannot start, which may not directly affect overall system functionality.\n\n4. Conclude the analysis:\n   - Given the context and the nature of the message, this should be classified as an informational message rather than an error or critical issue.\n</solutions> \n<answer> False </answer>"
