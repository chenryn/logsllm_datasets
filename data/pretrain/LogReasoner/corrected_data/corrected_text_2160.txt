      "MFIB/4/CNT_OVER_MAX:The multicast forwarding table counter [current-value] exceeds the max valid value [max-value]. It should be [updated-value]. (Protocol=[STRING], Vpn=[STRING], FileLine=[STRING][STRING])",
      "True",
      "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components in the log message: \"MFIB/4/CNT_OVER_MAX\" is the component indicating the nature of the event.\n2. Analyze the key phrase: \"The multicast forwarding table counter [current-value] exceeds the max valid value [max-value]. It should be [updated-value].\" This indicates a condition that exceeds a threshold, which is a warning sign.\n3. Determine the severity: The phrase \"exceeds the max valid value\" suggests that the system is not functioning as intended, but it is not a critical failure that immediately stops operations. It is more of a warning that something needs to be addressed.\n4. Conclusion: The log message is a warning, indicating that the system's state is outside of the expected range but not in a state that would halt operations immediately.\n</solutions>\n<answer> False </answer>"

    "<solutions> \n1. Analyze the log message components: \"MFIB/4/CNT_OVER_MAX\" indicates a situation concerning the multicast forwarding table counter.\n2. Examine the key statement: \"The multicast forwarding table counter [current-value] exceeds the max valid value [max-value]. It should be [updated-value].\" This statement clearly signifies that the current value surpasses a threshold, which is a serious indication that something is wrong.\n3. Evaluate the implications of exceeding a maximum threshold: Exceeding the maximum valid value typically signifies that the system is in a potentially faulty state or may lead to faults if not addressed. This doesn't simply indicate a warning but suggests a condition that requires attention.\n4. Consider the context: A counter exceeding its maximum valid value implies that corrective actions are needed to prevent potential issues, indicating it is not simply an informational message.\n5. Conclusion: Since the log indicates an operational issue that could lead to faults, the severity level should be considered as indicating a fault condition.\n</solutions> \n<answer> True </answer>"
