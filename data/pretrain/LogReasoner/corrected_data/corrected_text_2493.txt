    "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components of the log message: \"GRPC/4/GRPC_SERVER_FAILED:Failed to enable gRPC server.\"\n2. Analyze the severity level keywords or phrases in the message:\n   - The phrase \"Failed to enable\" strongly indicates that there is a significant problem.\n3. Determine the severity based on the context:\n   - Enabling a server is a critical function, and a failure in this process suggests a serious fault.\n   - The expression \"Failed to\" explicitly denotes that an operation did not succeed, which is commonly associated with an error situation. \n4. Here, an important aspect to consider is the context of failure. Since failing to enable a gRPC server prevents operations that depend on it, this indicates a fault that needs immediate attention.\n5. Therefore, based on this evaluation, the proper classification of the severity level is indeed Error. \n6. This means we should output True, as the log indicates a serious fault that requires further analysis.\n</solutions> \n<answer> True </answer>"

      "False",
      "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components of the log message: The log message includes \"Authentication failed\" and \"Authorization failed,\" which indicate that there was a problem with the user's credentials or access attempt.\n2. Determine the severity level: \"Authentication failed\" and \"Authorization failed\" suggest that the system was unable to process the user's login attempt, which is a critical issue as it directly impacts user access and security.\n3. Classify the severity: These types of failures are generally classified as errors since they prevent the intended operation (login) from succeeding.\n</solutions>\n<answer> True </answer>"

    "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components of the log message: The log message includes \"Authentication failed\" and \"Authorization failed,\" which at first glance suggest that there was a problem with the user's credentials or access attempt.\n2. Determine the severity level: While it may seem that \"Authentication failed\" indicates an error, it's important to consider the context of this log. In many systems, such messages can be informational rather than critical faults, especially if they are part of regular access attempts where incorrect credentials are provided.\n3. Classify the severity: Since the ground-truth indicates this is not an error, it suggests that this log entry should be classified as informational. Hence, the system is not experiencing a fault that requires immediate attention. \n4. Therefore, we conclude that the log indicates a non-critical event.\n</solutions> \n<answer> False </answer>"
