3. Compare the log entry and the description: Initially, it appears that the log entry refers specifically to the backup of physical interface information, while the description discusses backing up configurations in a more general sense. However, both statements involve the idea of backing up, albeit in different contexts.
4. Wait, this doesn’t seem right. Let’s pause and consider what we know so far: The log entry's focus on "Backup OSPF physical interface information" aligns with the general act of backing up configurations as mentioned in the description. Although the details differ, the core action of backing up is consistent between the two.
5. Determine if the description is a valid explanation: Since both the log entry and the description involve backing up information, despite the specificity of the interface in the log and the generality of the configurations in the description, the description can still be seen as valid in the context of the log entry's action.
 True

1. Start by analyzing the provided log entry: "OSPF/3/ISSU_SMOOTH_ACROSS: The OSPF backup module received the ISSU_SMOOTH_ACROSS event from the ISSU management module."
   - This log indicates that a specific event, "ISSU_SMOOTH_ACROSS," was received by the OSPF backup module.

2. Next, analyze the description: "The message that recorded the ISSU_SMOOTH_ACROSS event was received during the OSPF ISSU upgrade."
   - This description implies that the event is related to an OSPF upgrade but does not explicitly mention the OSPF backup module receiving the event.

3. Now, let's compare the two: 
   - Both the log entry and description refer to the "ISSU_SMOOTH_ACROSS" event.
   - The log specifies that the event was received by the OSPF backup module, while the description states it was received during an upgrade but does not clarify the receiving module.

4. Determine whether the description serves as a valid explanation of the log entry:
   - The key point here is that the description does not contradict any information from the log. Instead, it adds context by mentioning the OSPF ISSU upgrade.
   - However, the crucial aspect is that the description accurately matches the main event and implies the context in which it occurred. 

But, wait, let’s pause and examine this more carefully. The description does indeed address the event and its context, which is that it occurred during an OSPF ISSU upgrade. The omission of the OSPF backup module receiving the event does not invalidate the description as an explanation since it still conveys the overall situation correctly.

5. Given this analysis, since the description accurately reflects the event and its context, it can be concluded that it supports the log entry sufficiently without direct contradiction. Therefore, it serves as a valid explanation.

 True

<solutions> 
1. Let's first analyze the log entry: The log "ISIS/6/GT_LGC_PHY_FAIL:ISIS [process-id] failed to obtain the primary logical index [logical-index] through physical index [physical-index]." indicates a specific issue where the IS-IS process (identified by process-id) is unable to acquire the primary logical index due to a relation to a physical index.
2. Next, we examine the description: The description states, "IS-IS failed to obtain a logical interface." This indicates a failure to acquire a logical interface, but it does not specify the physical index, which is a critical component of the log entry.
3. Now, let's compare the two: While the description suggests a failure to obtain a logical interface, it lacks the specificity of the log entry which details the failure in obtaining a logical index through a physical index. However, the essence of both the log and the description point to a failure in obtaining a logical component related to IS-IS.
