However, wait, let's ensure this is right. The message indicates that an alarm has been cleared, which typically signifies the resolution of an alert, suggesting the type of alert is actually an \"Event Trap\" since it captures the event of the alarm being cleared. \n\nThus, it does not indicate a specific equipment failure but rather an event signaling that a previously raised alarm has been resolved or cleared.\n\nTherefore, the log indicates an \"Event Trap\".\n</solutions>\n<answer> Event Trap </answer>"
