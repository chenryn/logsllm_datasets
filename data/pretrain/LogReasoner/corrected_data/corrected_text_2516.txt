      "PKTCPT/6/PKTCPT_OPEN_FAIL:Failed to start packet capture. Reason: File for storing captured frames   not opened.",
      "False",
      "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components of the log message:\n   - Log Source: PKTCPT\n   - Log Level: OPEN_FAIL\n   - Event Description: Failed to start packet capture. Reason: File for storing captured frames not opened.\n\n2. Analyze the log level:\n   - The term \"OPEN_FAIL\" suggests an issue occurred during the opening or initialization process, which is typically indicative of a problem that prevents normal operation.\n\n3. Determine the severity:\n   - The inability to start packet capture means that a critical function has failed. This failure could prevent further operations that rely on packet capture from functioning correctly.\n   - The phrase \"not opened\" indicates a state that is not what it should be, implying a problem that needs to be addressed.\n\n4. Conclusion:\n   - Given the nature of the failure and its impact on the system's ability to perform a key function, this log message indicates a fault.\n</solutions>\n<answer> True </answer>"

    "<solutions>\n1. Identify the key components of the log message:\n   - Log Source: PKTCPT\n   - Log Level: OPEN_FAIL\n   - Event Description: Failed to start packet capture. Reason: File for storing captured frames not opened.\n\n2. Analyze the log level:\n   - The term \"OPEN_FAIL\" suggests an issue occurred during the opening or initialization process, which could be interpreted as a failure.\n\n3. Determine the severity:\n   - While the term \"OPEN_FAIL\" implies a problem, we need to consider the context of the message and what it signifies for the operation of the system. The failure to start packet capture indicates that a desired operation did not succeed, but this does not necessarily equate to a critical error.\n\n4. Wait a second, letâ€™s ensure this is right. Calculating carefully:\n   - The description mentions that the packet capture process failed due to the inability to open a file for storing frames. While this is indeed a failure, it does not indicate that the system is in a faulty state overall. It suggests an operational issue rather than a critical fault that would render the system inoperative.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - The description of the error points to an issue with a specific function rather than a system-wide failure. Therefore, this log message is more informational in nature, indicating a specific failure that does not compromise the overall functionality of the system.\n</solutions>\n<answer> False </answer>"
