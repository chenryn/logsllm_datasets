      "PCI Interrupt Link <*> (IRQs 5 7 10 11, disabled)",
      "normal",
      "<solutions> \n1. Analyzing the log entry: The log entry states \"PCI Interrupt Link <*> (IRQs 5 7 10 11, disabled)\". This indicates that a PCI interrupt link is disabled, and it lists the IRQs (Interrupt Request lines) that are associated with this link.\n2. Determining the normality: A disabled PCI interrupt link is generally not a normal state unless it is expected behavior in the system configuration. Typically, such links are enabled to allow the system to handle interrupts properly.\n3. Conclusion: Since the PCI interrupt link is disabled, this log entry suggests an abnormal condition.\n</solutions>\n<answer> abnormal </answer>"

    "<solutions> \n1. Analyzing the log entry: The log entry states \"PCI Interrupt Link <*> (IRQs 5 7 10 11, disabled)\". This indicates that a PCI interrupt link is disabled, and it lists the IRQs (Interrupt Request lines) that are associated with this link.\n2. Determining the normality: A disabled PCI interrupt link does raise concerns, but we need to consider the context. In some configurations, it may be expected behavior for certain links to be disabled if they are not in use or required by the system.\n3. Wait a second, letâ€™s ensure this is right. Calculating carefully: Here, we should look at common practices regarding PCI interrupt links. If the system was designed such that this specific link is not needed, then having it disabled does not imply an abnormal state.\n4. Reflection: It is essential to consider that the presence of disabled links might be entirely normal in a system that has different IRQ configurations or if certain devices are simply not utilizing that link.\n5. Conclusion: Given that the log entry represents a state that can be expected in certain configurations, we determine that this log entry is actually normal.\n</solutions>\n<answer> normal </answer>"
