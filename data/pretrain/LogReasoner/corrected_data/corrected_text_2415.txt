      "SNMP/3/SNMP_ACL_RESTRICTION:SNMP [STRING] from [STRING] is rejected due to ACL restriction.",
      "True",
      "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components of the log message: The log message indicates that an SNMP request was rejected due to ACL restrictions.\n2. Determine the severity level: The phrase \"is rejected\" suggests that an action was prevented or denied, which typically indicates a problem that needs attention.\n3. Compare with known severity levels:\n   - Warning: Indicates that something is wrong but the system can still function.\n   - Error: Indicates a failure that prevents the system from functioning.\n   - Critical: Indicates a severe failure that needs immediate attention.\n4. Conclude the severity level: The rejection due to ACL restrictions is more than just a warning but does not necessarily indicate a critical failure. It suggests a limitation or restriction that needs to be addressed, which is more severe than an informational message but not as critical as a failure.\n</solutions>\n\n<answer> False </answer>"

    "<solutions> \n1. Begin by identifying the key components of the log message: The log message states that an SNMP request is rejected due to ACL (Access Control List) restrictions.\n2. Analyze the phrase \"is rejected\": This indicates that an action was denied, which typically signals a potential problem that warrants attention.\n3. Evaluate the severity level based on known categories:\n   - Warning: Indicates something is wrong, but the system can still function.\n   - Error: Signifies a failure that prevents normal operations.\n   - Critical: Suggests a severe failure that requires immediate intervention.\n4. Given that the action (SNMP request) is being rejected, this is not merely an informational message. The rejection implies that there is an operational issue that could affect system performance or accessibility.\n5. Since the rejection stems from an ACL restriction, it suggests that access is being denied, which is a significant concern that can lead to further issues if not addressed.\n6. Therefore, it is reasonable to classify this log message as indicative of a warning, meaning it signifies a potential problem that needs to be monitored or rectified.\n</solutions> \n\n<answer> True </answer>"
