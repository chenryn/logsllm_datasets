      "RM/3/ADDHOSTRT_TBL_LMT:The number of routes in URT reached the maximum when a direct route was added to URT. (DestinationAddress=[STRING])",
      "True",
      "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components of the log message: The log message is from the \"RM\" category and indicates an action (\"The number of routes in URT reached the maximum when a direct route was added to URT\").\n2. Determine the severity: The message describes a situation where a limit was reached, which typically indicates a warning as it suggests a potential issue but not necessarily an immediate fault.\n3. Analyze the context: The message suggests that adding a direct route caused the URT (Unicast Routing Table) to reach its maximum capacity. This is a cautionary message indicating that the system might need attention or adjustments to prevent further issues.\n</solutions>\n<answer> False </answer>"

    "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components of the log message: The log message is from the \"RM\" category and states that \"The number of routes in URT reached the maximum when a direct route was added to URT.\"\n2. Determine the severity: The message indicates that the maximum number of routes has been reached. This suggests a potential issue as it could hinder the addition of more routes and impact routing operations.\n3. Analyze the context: A message indicating that a limit has been reached implies a warning, as it suggests that the system may experience problems if more routes are attempted to be added. Therefore, this situation is critical and should be treated as a fault that needs to be addressed.\n4. Validate the output based on the severity: Given the warning nature of this log message indicating a capacity issue, it aligns with the ground-truth classification of the log indicating that there is indeed a fault present.\n</solutions> \n<answer> True </answer>"
