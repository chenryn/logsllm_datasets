      "ISIS/6/T1TMR_LV2_EXPIR_GR_C:In ISIS [process-id], level-2 T1 timer expired on [interface-name] during ISIS GR. (Counter=[USHORT])",
      "False",
      "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components of the log message:\n   - Log Source: ISIS\n   - Log Level: T1TMR_LV2_EXPIR_GR_C\n   - Context: Level-2 T1 timer expired during ISIS Graceful Restart (GR)\n   - Additional Information: Counter value\n\n2. Analyze the log level and context:\n   - The term \"timer expired\" typically indicates a timeout or failure to complete a task within a specified period.\n   - The context of \"ISIS Graceful Restart\" suggests this is part of a recovery or failover process in a network protocol.\n\n3. Determine the severity based on the context and log level:\n   - A timer expiration in a critical protocol like ISIS, especially during a Graceful Restart, can indicate a potential issue that may affect network stability or performance.\n   - The log level \"T1TMR_LV2_EXPIR_GR_C\" is not explicitly defined in common log level conventions but the context suggests it is related to a warning or error condition.\n\n4. Conclusion:\n   - Given the context and the implication of a timer expiration in a critical network protocol, the log indicates a warning or error that should be monitored.\n</solutions>\n<answer> True </answer>"

    "<solutions>\n1. Identify the key components of the log message:\n   - Log Source: ISIS\n   - Log Level: T1TMR_LV2_EXPIR_GR_C\n   - Context: Level-2 T1 timer expired during ISIS Graceful Restart (GR)\n   - Additional Information: Counter value\n\n2. Analyze the log level and context:\n   - The term \"timer expired\" suggests a timeout or failure to complete a task within a specified period. This usually indicates a problem.\n   - However, the context of \"ISIS Graceful Restart\" (GR) is also crucial; it signifies that this log entry is part of a recovery process and might not be indicative of an error itself, but rather an expected behavior during such operations.\n\n3. Determine the severity based on the context and log level:\n   - While a timer expiration can indicate potential issues, during a Graceful Restart, this may just be an informational message indicating that the timer completed its cycle, which is expected behavior in this scenario.\n   - The log does not suggest an error that needs immediate attention; it merely provides information about the timer's status.\n\n4. Conclusion:\n   - Considering the context of ISIS Graceful Restart and how such timers function, this log entry does not represent a warning or error but rather an informational message. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that it should return False.\n</solutions>\n<answer> False </answer>"
