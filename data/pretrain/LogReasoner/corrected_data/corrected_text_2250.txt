      "ISIS/6/ISIS_PEER_HOLD_MAX_COST_EXIT: ISIS peer on interface [IfName] exit hold maximum cost state.(ProcessId=[ProcessId], Level=[Level], Reason=[Reason]) In LS mode, this log is supported only by the service LSs.",
      "False",
      "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components of the log message: The log message is from the ISIS protocol, indicating that an ISIS peer on a specific interface has exited the hold maximum cost state.\n2. Analyze the context and potential implications: The message states that the log is only supported by service LSs in LS mode, which suggests it might be informational but could also imply that there are operational considerations.\n3. Determine the severity: The term \"exit hold maximum cost state\" suggests a transition that might be significant but does not necessarily indicate a critical error. However, it could be a warning if the transition is unexpected or indicates a potential issue.\n4. Consider the keywords: The phrase \"exit hold maximum cost state\" is not typically associated with severe errors, but it could be a warning if the transition is not expected.\n5. Conclude the severity level: Given the context and the nature of the state transition, it is more likely a warning than a critical error, as it indicates a change in state that might need attention.\n</solutions>\n<answer> True </answer>"

    "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components of the log message: The log message indicates that an ISIS peer on a specific interface has exited the hold maximum cost state, which is a routine state transition in the protocol.\n2. Analyze the context and potential implications: The log specifies that this message is supported only by service LSs in LS mode. Such context suggests that the log message is meant to inform rather than indicate an error or warning.\n3. Determine the severity: The phrase \"exit hold maximum cost state\" points to a normal operational transition rather than a critical error. While it may be significant for operational awareness, it does not imply an error condition.\n4. Consider the keywords: The keywords present in the message do not indicate any fault or issue. They rather describe a state change that is part of normal protocol operations.\n5. Conclude the severity level: Based on the analysis, the log message appears to be informational and does not indicate a warning or error. Therefore, the correct assessment should lead to the conclusion that it is not a fault needing attention.\n</solutions>\n<answer> False </answer>"
