    "<solutions> \n1. First, I will analyze the structure and content of the log entry \"-> <*> -> vector <*> -> IRQ <*>\". \n2. The log consists of symbols and terms commonly used in computing, specifically in the context of interrupts and vectors. \n3. I notice that both \"vector\" and \"IRQ\" are standard terms; \"IRQ\" stands for Interrupt Request, which is fundamental in computer operations, while \"vector\" often refers to a data structure or a handling technique in system design. \n\nHowever, I must critically assess the use of \"<*>\". This notation could imply placeholders, and its presence might add ambiguity to the log's interpretation. \n\nNow, the interpretation hinges on whether the presence of standard terms in a log entry automatically categorizes it as \"normal.\" That’s where the earlier reasoning might have faltered. \n\nWait a second, let’s ensure this is right. Calculating carefully: \n- The log entry needs to be evaluated not just on the presence of technical terms, but also on how closely it resembles typical log entries. \n- If we consider the context of typical system logs, they usually contain more specific and concrete information rather than vague placeholders.\n\nGiven the ambiguity introduced by the \"<*>\", coupled with the standard terms \"vector\" and \"IRQ\", I need to reconsider how to classify this log entry. The presence of ambiguity here suggests that it may not align with the expected clarity of a \"normal\" log entry. \n\nThus, applying the exclusion method:\n- If the log were \"normal,\" it would be expected to have clear and specific identifiers and data without ambiguity.\n- The presence of \"<*>\" implies a departure from this clarity.\n\nTherefore, I conclude this log entry should indeed be classified as \"abnormal\" due to the ambiguity presented and its lack of concrete contextual grounding in a standard log format. \n</solutions> \n<answer> abnormal </answer>"
