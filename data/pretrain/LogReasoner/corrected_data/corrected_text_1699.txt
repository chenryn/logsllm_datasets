      "<solutions> \n1. Analyzing the log entry: The log entry states \"Kernel logging (proc) stopped.\" This suggests an event where the kernel logging for process-related events has ceased.\n2. Determining the normality of the log entry: Kernel logging is a system operation that typically runs continuously unless explicitly stopped or there is a system issue. Stopping kernel logging could be a result of a system configuration change or an issue that needs attention.\n3. Considering potential scenarios: If the system administrator has intentionally stopped the logging for maintenance or security reasons, it might be normal. However, if the logging was stopped unexpectedly, it could indicate a problem.\n4. Making a decision: Without additional context, the log entry alone does not provide enough information to definitively classify it as normal or abnormal. However, in the absence of further information, it leans towards being abnormal as unexpected stops of logging are typically indicative of issues.\n</solutions>\n<answer> abnormal </answer>"

    "<solutions> \n1. Analyzing the log entry: The log entry states \"Kernel logging (proc) stopped.\" This indicates that the kernel's logging for process-related events is no longer active.\n2. Determining the normality of the log entry: Kernel logging is essential for monitoring system performance and diagnosing issues. It typically runs continuously unless a specific action is taken to stop it.\n3. Considering potential scenarios: An intentional stopping of kernel logging could occur for maintenance purposes or in response to a planned configuration change. This suggests that not all instances of kernel logging being stopped are abnormal.\n4. Making a decision: While the previous reasoning leaned towards abnormal due to the lack of context, it is important to recognize that there are valid scenarios where this action is normal. An intentional stop, especially for maintenance or configuration, would classify this log entry as normal.\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that the log entry \"Kernel logging (proc) stopped\" does not inherently indicate an abnormality without further context, and it aligns with normal operational scenarios when stopped intentionally. \n</solutions> \n<answer> normal </answer>"
