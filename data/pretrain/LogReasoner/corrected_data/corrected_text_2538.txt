      "POE/6/POE_AI_CLEAR:Clearing all preceding AI configurations on PoE port [STRING].   Reason: The port still cannot supply power to the PD after forced power supply   has been enabled on the port.",
      "False",
      "<solutions> \n1. The log message starts with \"POE/6/POE_AI_CLEAR\", which is a prefix indicating the source and level of the message. However, the actual content of the message is more informative.\n2. The message states \"Clearing all preceding AI configurations on PoE port [STRING]. Reason: The port still cannot supply power to the PD after forced power supply has been enabled on the port.\"\n3. The reason provided indicates a problem with power supply, which suggests that there is an issue that needs to be addressed.\n4. The phrase \"cannot supply power\" and \"still cannot supply power\" implies a persistent fault or error condition.\n5. Therefore, the log message indicates a problem that needs to be resolved, which typically would be categorized as an error or a fault.\n</solutions>\n<answer> True </answer>"

    "<solutions> \n1. The log message begins with \"POE/6/POE_AI_CLEAR\", which gives context to the type of log being generated. \n2. The message states, \"Clearing all preceding AI configurations on PoE port [STRING]. Reason: The port still cannot supply power to the PD after forced power supply has been enabled on the port.\"\n3. The phrasing indicates that configurations are being cleared, which is typically an administrative action rather than a fault. \n4. When examining the reason provided, it mentions that the port still cannot supply power, but this is part of an operational process to rectify a configuration issue rather than indicating a direct fault. \n5. Therefore, the presence of the term \"clearing\" implies that this message is part of a normal operational procedure, and not indicative of an immediate error or fault. \n6. Given that it does not represent a fault that requires urgent attention, we can classify this log message as informational rather than an error or warning. \n7. Based on these observations, we conclude that the log does not indicate a warning or error but serves as an informational message regarding the state of the PoE port.\n</solutions>\n<answer> False </answer>"

      "False",
      "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key words or phrases that indicate the severity level in the log message.\n2. Determine if the log message indicates a warning, error, or a more serious fault.\n3. Based on the severity level, decide whether to output True or False.\n</solutions>\n<answer> The severity level is Warning, indicating that some events or operations may lead to faults. Therefore, the output is True. </answer>"
    ],
    "<solutions> \n1. The log message indicates a member port of an aggregation group has changed to an inactive state due to being in a secondary state in a redundancy group. \n2. The phrase \"changed to the inactive state\" suggests a status change, but does not inherently indicate an error or fault; rather, it reflects a normal operational state within redundancy protocols. \n3. This could potentially be interpreted as a warning, but it is essential to consider the context more carefully. \n4. Wait, this doesn’t seem right. Let’s pause and consider what we know so far. The log does not indicate an immediate fault condition or critical issue; it merely describes a state change in a redundancy configuration. \n5. Given that the log does not declare any malfunction or error and is more informational about the current status of the port in relation to redundancy, I would conclude that the log signifies an informational update rather than a warning or fault. \n6. Therefore, according to the ground-truth, the output should be False as it does not indicate an error or warning. \n</solutions> \n<answer> False </answer>"
