      "POE/6/POE_AI_DISCONNET_AC:Changing from MPS detection to AC detection on PoE port [STRING].   Reason: The port still cannot supply power to the PD after MPS detection is   delayed.",
      "False",
      "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components of the log message:\n   - The log is related to a change in detection methods for PoE (Power over Ethernet) ports.\n   - It mentions transitioning from MPS (Maximum Power Supply) detection to AC (Alternating Current) detection.\n   - The reason provided is that the port still cannot supply power to the PD (Power Device) after MPS detection is delayed.\n\n2. Analyze the severity based on the components:\n   - The log describes a change in operational behavior due to a detected issue.\n   - It indicates that the system is adapting to a problem by switching detection methods, which implies an ongoing issue or potential fault.\n\n3. Determine the severity level:\n   - Given the context, the log suggests that there is a problem with power supply detection and the system is taking corrective action.\n   - This indicates that there is a warning or potential issue that needs attention.\n</solutions>\n<answer> True </answer>"

    "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components of the log message:\n   - The log indicates a transition in detection methods for PoE (Power over Ethernet) ports.\n   - It specifically states changing from MPS (Maximum Power Supply) detection to AC (Alternating Current) detection.\n   - The reason provided is that the port still cannot supply power to the PD (Power Device) after MPS detection is delayed.\n\n2. Analyze the severity based on the components:\n   - The message describes a change in operational behavior due to a detected issue.\n   - It indicates that the system is adapting to a problem by switching detection methods, although the wording suggests a reactive measure rather than a fault.\n\n3. Determine the severity level:\n   - However, wait, letâ€™s ensure this is right. The log describes a change in detection methods and provides a rationale for this change, which does not necessarily indicate that there is a fault or warning.\n   - The context of the message suggests that the system is operating normally under the circumstances, even if there is a need for adaptation; this action does not inherently signal an error or a warning.\n\n4. Referring to the ground-truth, which states the log should be classified as False:\n   - Since the log is presenting operational information rather than indicating a failure or critical warning, it qualifies as an informational message.\n   - Therefore, it should be classified as non-error.\n\n5. Hence, the correct determination is that this log message is informational and not indicative of a fault or warning.\n</solutions> \n<answer> False </answer>"
