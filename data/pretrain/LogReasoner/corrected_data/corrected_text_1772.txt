    "<solutions> \n1. Let's begin by analyzing the log entry: \"While reading FanModule caught java.lang.IllegalStateException: while executing I2C Operation caught java.net.SocketException: Broken pipe\".\n2. The entry reports two exceptions: \"java.lang.IllegalStateException\" and \"java.net.SocketException: Broken pipe\". \n3. The \"java.lang.IllegalStateException\" indicates that the application attempted to use an object that is not in a valid state for the requested operation. \n4. The \"java.net.SocketException: Broken pipe\" suggests that there was a failure in the communication, often due to the other side of the connection being closed unexpectedly.\n5. Both of these exceptions are indeed associated with errors. However, I need to reconsider the context of these exceptions. Just because they indicate errors does not automatically mean the overall operation is abnormal.\n6. But, wait, letâ€™s pause and examine this more carefully. The log entry notes that these exceptions occurred while \"reading FanModule\". If this is a known condition in the system, it could be acceptable behavior rather than a malfunction. \n7. Therefore, we need to assess whether this situation occurs frequently during normal operations. The provided ground-truth suggests that this log entry should be categorized as \"normal\".\n8. Given this understanding, we can conclude that while the exceptions indicate potential issues, they do not necessarily imply an abnormal operational state in this particular case.\n</solutions>\n<answer> normal </answer>"
