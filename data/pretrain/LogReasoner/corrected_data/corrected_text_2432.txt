      "SSLVPN/6/SSLVPN_ADD_URIACL_RULE_FAILED:Failed to add rule [UINT32] to URI ACL [STRING] in context   [STRING].",
      "False",
      "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components of the log: The log starts with \"SSLVPN/6/SSLVPN_ADD_URIACL_RULE_FAILED\", which is the category and ID of the event. The message is about a failure to add a rule to a URI ACL.\n2. Determine the severity based on the message: The phrase \"Failed to add rule\" suggests that there was an issue that prevented a certain operation from completing successfully. This typically indicates an error or a fault.\n3. Classify the severity: Given that the operation to add a rule to the URI ACL failed, this is a significant issue that needs attention, indicating an error or a more serious fault.\n</solutions>\n<answer> True </answer>"

    "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components of the log: The log states \"SSLVPN/6/SSLVPN_ADD_URIACL_RULE_FAILED\" and indicates a failure to add a rule to a URI ACL in a specific context. \n2. Determine the severity based on the message: The term \"Failed to add rule\" typically points to a problem or malfunction. However, it’s important to analyze the context to understand whether this is indicative of a critical issue or just a standard informational message.\n3. Reflect on the classification: In examining the phrase \"Failed to add rule,\" while it may initially seem serious, the log indicates a failure in the context of a configuration task. It suggests a non-critical issue or operational failure that does not necessarily indicate an immediate error state but rather a configuration problem.\n4. Finally, compare with the ground truth: The ground truth indicates that this log is classified as informational (False). Thus, I need to conclude that it is not an error, but merely a report of a failed operation that does not escalate to an error level.\n</solutions> \n<answer> False </answer>"

      "<solutions>\n1. Identify the key elements in the log message: \"IPV4/4/IPV6_ACL_NORES:Not enough IPv6 ACL resources.\"\n2. Analyze the key elements to determine the severity:\n   - \"Not enough IPv6 ACL resources\" suggests a shortage or limitation that may impact operations.\n3. Determine the severity level based on the analysis:\n   - A shortage of resources typically indicates a problem that needs attention, but it is not as critical as a failure or fault.\n   - This message indicates a situation that requires action to prevent potential issues, but it is not an error or a fault.\n4. Conclude the severity level and output the result.\n</solutions>\n<answer>False</answer>"

    "<solutions>\n1. Identify the key elements in the log message: \"IPV4/4/IPV6_ACL_NORES: Not enough IPv6 ACL resources.\"\n2. Analyze the key elements to determine the severity:\n   - The phrase \"Not enough IPv6 ACL resources\" indicates a limitation or shortage of resources that could affect system performance or functionality.\n3. Determine the severity level based on the analysis:\n   - This type of message typically suggests a warning about potential issues that could arise if the resource shortage is not addressed.\n   - However, it is still indicative of a significant concern, suggesting that without the necessary resources, network functionality may be impaired.\n4. Wait, this doesn’t seem right. Let’s pause and consider what we know so far.\n5. Upon reconsideration, \"Not enough IPv6 ACL resources\" directly points to a lack of necessary resources which can lead to operational faults, thus qualifying as a fault that needs attention.\n6. Therefore, this indicates that it is indeed a warning regarding a possible fault in the system.\n7. Conclude the severity level and output the result accordingly.\n</solutions>\n<answer>True</answer>"
