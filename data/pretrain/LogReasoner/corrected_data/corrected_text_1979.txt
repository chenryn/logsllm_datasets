      "Success (0) in req_quejob, requested queue not found",
      "normal",
      "<solutions> \n1. Analyze the log entry: The log entry states \"Success (0) in req_quejob, requested queue not found\".\n2. Identify key elements: The key elements are \"Success (0)\", \"req_quejob\", and \"requested queue not found\".\n3. Interpret the meaning: \"Success (0)\" suggests that the operation was completed successfully, but the result is 0, which could indicate no queue was found. \"req_quejob\" is the name of the operation or function being performed.\n4. Determine the category: Even though the operation was successful, the fact that the requested queue was not found suggests an issue or anomaly in the system operation. Therefore, this log entry indicates an abnormal situation.\n</solutions>\n<answer> abnormal </answer>"

    "<solutions> \n1. Analyze the log entry: The log entry states \"Success (0) in req_quejob, requested queue not found\".\n2. Identify key elements: The key elements are \"Success (0)\", \"req_quejob\", and \"requested queue not found\".\n3. Interpret the meaning: \"Success (0)\" indicates that the operation was completed successfully, but the result being 0 could suggest that while the operation ran, it did not yield any results, which may be a normal condition in some contexts. However, the phrase \"requested queue not found\" raises a concern about whether the operation could be considered fully successful.\n4. Determine the category: This is where we need to stop and reconsider. The use of \"Success (0)\" means that the operation itself did not encounter an error; it simply indicates that nothing was found. Thus, it could still be categorized as a normal log entry in this context, given that the absence of a queue does not indicate a failure of the operation.\n5. Therefore, the interpretation must align with the context of what \"success\" means in this operation. Since the operation was completed without any error, the log entry should be considered normal.\n</solutions> \n<answer> normal </answer>"
