      "Resource temporarily unavailable (11) in pbs_mom, cannot lock '/var/spool/pbs/mom_priv/mom.lock' - another mom running",
      "normal",
      "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key elements in the log entry: The log mentions \"Resource temporarily unavailable (11)\", which is a specific error code, and it indicates an issue with locking a file in the PBS (Portable Batch System) environment.\n2. Analyze the context: The error suggests that another instance of the MOM (Managed Object Manager) is already running and preventing the current MOM from accessing the necessary lock file.\n3. Determine the impact: This error can prevent the MOM from functioning properly, leading to potential job scheduling issues or system instability.\n4. Compare against normal conditions: In a normal operation, the MOM should be able to acquire the necessary locks without issues, ensuring smooth job management.\n5. Conclude: Given the error indicates a failure in acquiring a critical lock, this log entry represents an abnormal condition.\n</solutions>\n<answer> abnormal </answer>"

    "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key elements in the log entry: The log mentions \"Resource temporarily unavailable (11)\", indicating a specific error code regarding resource access, and it indicates an issue with locking a file in the PBS environment.\n2. Analyze the context: The message suggests that another instance of the MOM is currently running and preventing the current MOM from accessing the lock file. This could imply concurrent operations, which is not inherently abnormal.\n3. Determine the impact: The inability to lock the file does suggest a coordination issue, but does it imply a failure in normal operations? If multiple MOMs are intended to run simultaneously, this might not be a problem.\n4. Compare against normal conditions: In a well-configured PBS environment, having multiple MOM instances running could be expected, and as such, the inability to lock might just indicate that another instance is performing as intended.\n5. Let's pause and consider what we know so far. The log entry may suggest a temporary condition related to resource access rather than an outright failure. If the system is designed to handle such cases, this could indeed be categorized as normal behavior.\n</solutions>\n<answer> normal </answer>"
