      "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components of the log message to determine the type of alert.\n2. The log mentions \"FIB/1/hwFIBOverloadForward\" which indicates a problem with the Forwarding Information Base (FIB) being overloaded.\n3. The phrase \"is in the overload forwarding state\" suggests a system state that has deviated from normal operation, which typically indicates an alarm.\n4. The log includes details about the entity involved (interface board) and the severity and probable cause of the issue, which is typical of an alarm log.\n5. Comparing the log message to the provided list of alert types, the closest match is 'environmentalAlarm' as it involves system state changes that can impact operations, though it's not a direct match, it's the most appropriate from the given options.\n</solutions>\n<answer> environmentalAlarm </answer>"

    "<solutions> \n1. Let's start by breaking down the log message: \"FIB/1/hwFIBOverloadForward: The interface board is in the overload forwarding state because the FIB module is overloaded.\"\n2. The identifier \"FIB/1/hwFIBOverloadForward\" indicates that the issue is related to the Forwarding Information Base (FIB) module.\n3. The phrase \"is in the overload forwarding state\" indeed points to a problematic state of the system, which typically indicates an alarm situation.\n4. The log provides information about the entity affected (the interface board) and mentions conditions leading to the alarm (overloading of the FIB module).\n5. However, wait, this doesn’t seem right. Let’s pause and consider what we know so far. \n6. The alert type is not just about environmental conditions; it revolves around processing limitations and failures in the system's operation due to overload.\n7. When we carefully examine the provided list of alert types, the situation described in the log aligns more closely with a 'processingErrorAlarm' because the FIB module is overloaded, which indicates a processing limitation rather than an environmental issue.\n8. Therefore, we can conclude that the alert type should be a processing error rather than an environmental alarm.\n</solutions> \n<answer> processingErrorAlarm </answer>"
