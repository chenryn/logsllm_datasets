      "SECDIAG/6/MONITOR_BLADE_CONTEXT_CLOSE:Disabled monitoring of the number of contexts in a security    engine group. Adding too many contexts to a security engine group might    cause system resource exhaustion and device exceptions.",
      "False",
      "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components of the log message:\n   - Log Source: SECDIAG\n   - Log Number: 6\n   - Log Message: \"Disabled monitoring of the number of contexts in a security engine group. Adding too many contexts to a security engine group might cause system resource exhaustion and device exceptions.\"\n\n2. Analyze the log message:\n   - The message indicates a change in the system behavior (monitoring disabled).\n   - It mentions potential consequences (system resource exhaustion and device exceptions).\n\n3. Determine the severity based on the potential impact:\n   - The message suggests that if not managed, it could lead to system issues, which is a significant concern.\n   - The phrase \"might cause\" indicates a warning about potential future issues.\n\n4. Conclude based on the severity:\n   - Given the potential for system resource exhaustion and device exceptions, this log message should be considered a warning.\n</solutions>\n\n<answer> True </answer>"

Adding too many contexts to a security engine group might cause system resource exhaustion and device exceptions.\"\n\n2. Analyze the log message:\n   - The message indicates that monitoring has been disabled and outlines possible consequences of adding too many contexts, which could lead to resource exhaustion and exceptions.\n\n3. Determine the severity based on the message content:\n   - While the message discusses potential risks, it does not indicate that an error has occurred; rather, it reflects a change in monitoring status. The phrase \"might cause\" refers to future threats rather than present faults.\n\n4. Reflect on the need for accurate classification:\n   - The fact that monitoring is disabled is an informational update about system behavior, and the potential consequences, while serious, are hypothetical rather than indicating an immediate error.\n\n5. Conclude based on the analysis:\n   - Since the log message provides information rather than indicating an active problem or fault, it should be classified as non-error. Therefore, the output is False.\n</solutions>\n\n<answer> False </answer>"
