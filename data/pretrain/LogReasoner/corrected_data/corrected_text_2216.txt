      "DHCP/4/hwDHCPRelayProxyUsrThreshold_active: The number of DHCP relay proxy entries exceeded the threshold. (Current number=[CurrentNumber], Max number=[MaxNumber]) In VS mode, this log is supported only by the admin VS.",
      "True",
      "<solutions>\n1. Identify the key components of the log message:\n   - Log Source: DHCP\n   - Log ID: 4\n   - Log Message: \"The number of DHCP relay proxy entries exceeded the threshold.\"\n   - Log Details: (Current number=[CurrentNumber], Max number=[MaxNumber])\n2. Analyze the log message to determine its severity:\n   - The log indicates that a threshold has been exceeded, which suggests a potential issue that needs attention.\n   - However, the message itself does not explicitly state an error or fault.\n   - The message is informational in nature, informing about a condition that may require action.\n3. Determine the appropriate classification:\n   - Given that the log message is informational and does not indicate an error or critical fault, it should be classified as non-error.\n</solutions>\n<answer>False</answer>"

    "<solutions>\n1. Identify the key components of the log message:\n   - Log Source: DHCP\n   - Log ID: 4\n   - Log Message: \"The number of DHCP relay proxy entries exceeded the threshold.\"\n   - Log Details: (Current number=[CurrentNumber], Max number=[MaxNumber])\n2. Analyze the log message to determine its severity:\n   - The log indicates that the number of DHCP relay proxy entries has exceeded a specified threshold. This typically implies a condition that could lead to issues if not addressed.\n   - It does suggest that there is a potential problem, often interpreted as requiring attention due to excessive entries. \n3. Determine the appropriate classification:\n   - The phrase \"exceeded the threshold\" typically indicates a warning or a critical condition, as it implies that the system may not function optimally if the threshold is not addressed. \n   - Therefore, rather than being merely informational, this log message indicates a warning about a potential error condition that needs attention.\n</solutions>\n<answer>True</answer>"
