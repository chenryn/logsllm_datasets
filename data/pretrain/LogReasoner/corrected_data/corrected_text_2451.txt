      "ND/6/ND_SET_PORT_TRUST_NORESOURCE:Not enough resources to   complete the operation.",
      "False",
      "<solutions>\n1. Identify the log level or key phrases that indicate the severity.\n2. In the given log, \"Not enough resources to complete the operation\" suggests that the system lacks necessary resources to perform the requested action, which typically indicates a warning or error.\n3. The format \"ND/6/ND_SET_PORT_TRUST_NORESOURCE\" does not provide additional context about severity.\n4. Based on the phrase \"Not enough resources to complete the operation,\" this log suggests that the system is unable to proceed with the intended operation due to a lack of resources, which implies a warning or error.\n5. Given that the log indicates a failure to complete an operation due to insufficient resources, this is more serious than just informational and indicates a warning or error.\n</solutions>\n<answer> True </answer>"

    "<solutions>\n1. Start by analyzing the log message: \"ND/6/ND_SET_PORT_TRUST_NORESOURCE: Not enough resources to complete the operation.\"\n2. The phrase \"Not enough resources to complete the operation\" suggests a problem that could indicate an error or warning. However, I need to consider the full context and the classification of logs.\n3. The prefix \"ND/6/ND_SET_PORT_TRUST_NORESOURCE\" could imply a specific operational context, but doesn’t necessarily indicate severity on its own.\n4. Wait, this doesn’t seem right. Let’s pause and consider what we know so far. The phrase indicates a resource limitation issue, but it does not specify that an operation has failed outright; it just states a lack of resources.\n5. The Ground-truth indicates that this log should be classified as informational. This distinction is crucial: while it suggests that an operation cannot proceed due to a lack of resources, it does not denote a critical failure or warning but rather an informational state about the current resource availability.\n6. Therefore, upon re-evaluating the severity of this log, it can be classified as a non-error and purely informational.\n</solutions>\n<answer> False </answer>"
