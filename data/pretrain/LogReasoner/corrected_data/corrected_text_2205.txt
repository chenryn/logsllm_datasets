      "PKI/4/GETTING_LOCAL_CERT: Realm [realm_name] is getting local certificate through [protocol]...",
      "True",
      "<solutions> \n1. Identify the log structure and keywords: The log follows a pattern where it starts with the log source (PKI/4/), followed by a log message (GETTING_LOCAL_CERT), and includes additional information about the realm, protocol, etc.\n2. Determine the severity based on keywords: The term \"getting\" suggests an ongoing process rather than an error or critical issue. There are no words or phrases indicating a warning or error.\n3. Compare with provided examples: The examples show that warnings or errors are indicated by phrases such as \"Critical,\" \"Warning,\" or specific error messages.\n</solutions>\n<answer> False </answer>"

    "<solutions> \n1. Identify the log structure and keywords: The log begins with the log source (PKI/4/) and contains a message (GETTING_LOCAL_CERT) about a realm obtaining a local certificate.\n2. Analyze the action described: The term \"getting\" suggests an ongoing process, but it doesn't inherently indicate that it is merely an informational message. \n3. Evaluate the context of the log: The log indicates that a certificate is being obtained, which is a critical function in ensuring secure communication. This action can be seen as significant and may imply that the system is performing necessary operations to maintain security.\n4. Reconsider the severity level: While it may not state a direct fault, the process of obtaining a local certificate is crucial and could relate to potential warnings or system states that need monitoring.\n5. Compare with provided examples: None of the previous logs directly align with this one since it doesn't read as purely informational, but the context suggests it should be treated more seriously than initially considered.\n6. Apply the exclusion method: Given the importance of the process mentioned in the log entry, it cannot be classified as a non-error, and thus we should determine that it indicates a warning or significant operational state.\n</solutions> \n<answer> True </answer>"
