    "<solutions> \nThe log entry \"enable <*> <*>\" needs to be evaluated for normality or abnormality. \n\n1. The term \"enable\" is commonly used in system configurations to activate or start a service or feature.\n2. The use of wildcard characters <*> in this log entry is indeed unusual and not commonly seen in standard system logs.\n3. Wildcards are typically employed in more complex log entries to represent any value or pattern, but their presence in a simple command like \"enable\" raises questions about the context.\n4. However, let's pause and consider what we know so far. The command \"enable\" is standard, and although the wildcards are not conventional, they do not inherently indicate an abnormal situation when the broader context is considered.\n5. The log entry lacks additional context that would clearly define it as abnormal. In fact, without further information, it is possible that the log entry is still operating within a valid command structure, albeit with unconventional syntax.\n\nThus, evaluating the log entry against standard usage, we find that it aligns with normal operational patterns despite the unusual appearance of the wildcards.\n\n</solutions>\n<answer> normal </answer>"
