      "PIM/4/CHANGE_TO_NON_DR:In VPN instance \"[vpn-instance-name]\", interface [interface-name] ([interface-address]) is changed to Non-DR. New DR is [dr-address]. (FlCode=[STRING][ULONG])",
      "True",
      "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components of the log message: The log message contains details about a change in the state of an interface within a PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast) context, specifically changing from a Designated Router (DR) to a Non-DR.\n2. Analyze the keywords and context: The term \"changed to Non-DR\" suggests a transition that may have implications for multicast traffic management, but does not explicitly indicate a fault or error.\n3. Determine the severity: The phrase \"In the context of PIM, an interface changing from DR to Non-DR is a significant but not necessarily fault-inducing event. It indicates a change in network state rather than an error.\"\n4. Compare to provided examples: The log does not match the patterns of logs indicating warnings or critical faults as seen in the provided examples.\n</solutions>\n<answer> False </answer>"

    "<solutions>\n1. Identify the key components of the log message: The log message indicates a state change in a VPN instance where an interface is changing from a Designated Router (DR) to a Non-DR.\n2. Analyze the keywords and context: The phrase \"changed to Non-DR\" indicates a significant change in network operations, particularly in how multicast traffic will be managed. This can have implications on the network's functionality.\n3. Determine the severity: While it may seem like a change without error implications, in the context of PIM, a transition to Non-DR can affect the multicast routing capabilities. Therefore, it is more critical than initially thought.\n4. Compare to provided examples: The log suggests a change that is important for the network state, and similar to logs that indicate a warning or critical situation, this change should not be overlooked as it could lead to issues if not monitored.\n5. Conclude the severity: Given the importance of the change in DR status in the context of PIM, it is reasonable to conclude that this log indicates a warning about potential implications for multicast traffic management.\n</solutions>\n<answer> True </answer>"
