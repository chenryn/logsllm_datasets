      "RM/4/URT_RCH_MAX_IPPRFX:The number of prefixes reached the maximum prefix limit [max-prefix-limit] in the routing table. (RoutingTableId=[ULONG])",
      "True",
      "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components of the log message: The log message is about the number of prefixes reaching the maximum limit in a routing table. The message does not indicate any immediate failure or error but rather a threshold being reached.\n2. Determine the severity: The phrase \"reached the maximum prefix limit\" suggests that while this is a significant event, it does not indicate a failure or critical issue. It is more of a notification that actions may need to be taken to prevent further issues, such as reducing the number of prefixes or increasing the limit.\n3. Compare with the given examples: The input log is similar to the example \"MPLS_LSPM/[MASK]/BBRESUME: Main LSP of Tunnel resumes from backup LSP in Best-effort Backup.\" which was categorized as a warning.\n</solutions>\n<answer> False </answer>"

    "<solutions> \n1. Identify the key components of the log message: The log message indicates that the number of prefixes has reached the maximum prefix limit in the routing table. This could potentially lead to issues if not addressed.\n2. Determine the severity: The phrase \"reached the maximum prefix limit\" suggests that this situation could lead to operational problems, indicating that it is more than just a simple notification. It implies that a critical condition has been met that could affect routing operations.\n3. Compare with the given examples: In the previous examples, reaching a limit or condition that could lead to faults has been categorized as a warning or error condition. \n4. Wait a second, letâ€™s ensure this is right. Calculating carefully: Considering the implications of \"maximum prefix limit,\" this scenario necessitates attention since it may indicate a fault condition. Therefore, it aligns with an error or warning severity and should not be dismissed as informational.\n5. Based on the above analysis, this log should be categorized as an error condition due to its potential to cause issues in routing stability.\n</solutions> \n<answer> True </answer>"
