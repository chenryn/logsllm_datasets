    "<solutions> \n1. The log entry provided is \"gmond <*> <*>\".\n2. To determine if this log entry is normal or abnormal, we need to understand the context and expected behavior of the \"gmond\" component.\n3. \"gmond\" typically stands for Graphite Monitoring Daemon, a component used in monitoring systems to collect and report metrics.\n4. The log entry format \"gmond <*> <*>\" indicates an incomplete logging message, which could lead to confusion in interpreting its status.\n5. However, let's pause and consider what we know so far. The categorization of log entries as normal or abnormal relies on understanding their content and context.\n6. The fact that the log entry is incomplete does not automatically classify it as abnormal. It may simply signify a standard operation where no significant event occurred, which would align with the behavior of \"gmond.\"\n7. Normal log entries can sometimes appear incomplete if they are routine operational messages without errors or noteworthy events.\n8. Therefore, based on the typical operation of \"gmond\" and the absence of any error indications within the log entry, it is more appropriate to categorize this log entry as normal.\n</solutions>\n<answer> normal </answer>"
