      "<solutions> \n1. Analyze the log entry: The log entry \"ISIS/6/GT_LGC_PHY_FAIL:ISIS [process-id] failed to obtain the primary logical index [logical-index] through physical index [physical-index].\" indicates that the IS-IS process (process-id) could not obtain a primary logical index for a given physical index. This failure is due to an inability to map the physical index to a logical index.\n2. Analyze the description: The description \"IS-IS failed to obtain a logical interface.\" suggests that the IS-IS process was unable to obtain a logical interface.\n3. Compare the log entry and the description: The log entry specifies that the failure is related to obtaining a primary logical index through a physical index, while the description states a failure to obtain a logical interface. These two statements are not directly equivalent. The description is more general and does not capture the specific detail of the physical index and logical index relationship.\n</solutions>\n<answer> False </answer>"

    "<solutions> \n1. Let's first analyze the log entry: The log \"ISIS/6/GT_LGC_PHY_FAIL:ISIS [process-id] failed to obtain the primary logical index [logical-index] through physical index [physical-index].\" indicates a specific issue where the IS-IS process (identified by process-id) is unable to acquire the primary logical index due to a relation to a physical index.\n2. Next, we examine the description: The description states, \"IS-IS failed to obtain a logical interface.\" This indicates a failure to acquire a logical interface, but it does not specify the physical index, which is a critical component of the log entry.\n3. Now, let's compare the two: While the description suggests a failure to obtain a logical interface, it lacks the specificity of the log entry which details the failure in obtaining a logical index through a physical index. However, the essence of both the log and the description point to a failure in obtaining a logical component related to IS-IS.\n4. However, letâ€™s pause and consider what we know so far. The critical factor here is that obtaining a primary logical index is directly related to obtaining a logical interface. The description may not be as detailed, but it does capture the main concept of failure in acquiring a logical index. Therefore, it can still be seen as valid, even if it lacks specific details that are present in the log entry.\n5. Thus, the description accurately depicts the situation described in the log entry, confirming that the problem lies in the IS-IS process's inability to acquire a logical component. \n</solutions>\n<answer> True </answer>"
