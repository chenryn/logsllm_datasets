      "CES/2/hwCesPwOppositeAcFault:Pseudo wire opposite ac over limit alarm of PWE3 was detected. (IfIndex=[IfIndex], VcId=[VcId], VcType=[VcType], PeerAddress=[PeerAddress], InterfaceName=[InterfaceName])",
      "qualityOfServiceAlarm",
      "<solutions> \n1. The log entry describes a situation where an alarm has been detected regarding a pseudo wire (PWE3) connection.\n2. The specific issue mentioned is \"Pseudo wire opposite ac over limit alarm,\" which indicates that there is a problem with the opposite access circuit (AC) for the pseudo wire.\n3. Given the nature of the alarm, it is related to a communication issue or a problem that impacts the operational state of a network element.\n4. Among the provided categories, the most appropriate one that fits this description is \"communicationsAlarm\" as it pertains to a communication-related issue in the network.\n</solutions>\n<answer> communicationsAlarm </answer>"

    "<solutions> \n1. The log entry describes a situation where an alarm has been detected regarding a pseudo wire (PWE3) connection.\n2. The specific issue mentioned is \"Pseudo wire opposite ac over limit alarm,\" which indicates that there is a problem with the opposite access circuit (AC) for the pseudo wire.\n3. This condition suggests a limitation has been exceeded, which generally relates to the quality of service provided over that connection.\n4. But, wait, letâ€™s pause and examine this more carefully. A \"over limit alarm\" typically indicates that the quality of service is being impacted, rather than just a communications issue.\n5. The key term here is \"over limit,\" which aligns more closely with metrics such as throughput or packet loss that degrade service quality.\n6. Therefore, among the provided categories, the correct type that best fits the description is \"qualityOfServiceAlarm,\" as it directly addresses the impact on service quality due to the alarm. \n</solutions> \n<answer> qualityOfServiceAlarm </answer>"

      "DEVM/1/hwCopperPolarityError:Copper polarity error alarm. (hwPhysicalPortIfIndex=[hwPhysicalPortIfIndex],InterfaceName=[hwPhysicalPortName])",
      "communicationsAlarm",
      "<solutions> \n1. The log message is: \"DEVM/1/hwCopperPolarityError:Copper polarity error alarm. (hwPhysicalPortIfIndex=[hwPhysicalPortIfIndex],InterfaceName=[hwPhysicalPortName])\"\n2. The log message describes an error related to the polarity of a copper port, which indicates a problem with the physical hardware.\n3. Among the given options, the type of alert that best fits this description is \"equipmentAlarm\", as it typically refers to issues with the equipment or hardware itself.\n</solutions>\n<answer> equipmentAlarm </answer>"

    "<solutions> \n1. The log message is: \"DEVM/1/hwCopperPolarityError:Copper polarity error alarm. (hwPhysicalPortIfIndex=[hwPhysicalPortIfIndex],InterfaceName=[hwPhysicalPortName])\"\n2. This log indicates a specific type of error related to copper polarity, which suggests a malfunction or issue with the physical interface of the device.\n3. The first reasoning step identifies that this is an error concerning physical hardware. However, let's pause and consider what we know so far.\n4. In analyzing the provided types of alerts, we should evaluate whether this alert truly aligns with \"equipmentAlarm\" or if it can be categorized differently.\n5. The term \"copper polarity error\" typically relates to communication issues rather than just a direct hardware failure. This suggests that it might be more appropriate to categorize it under \"communicationsAlarm.\"\n6. Upon further analysis and comparing it to our available options, it seems that the classification should not be solely based on the physical nature of the error, but also on the implications of what the error represents in terms of communication functionality.\n7. Therefore, the correct classification for this log message is \"communicationsAlarm\" due to its direct impact on interface communication. \n</solutions> \n<answer> communicationsAlarm </answer>"
