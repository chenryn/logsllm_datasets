7. Considering the ground-truth indicates "normal," it could be possible that the system is designed to handle these exceptions in such a way that it continues to operate within expected parameters.
8. Therefore, it is essential to recognize that even with errors present, the system might still function correctly in its designed capacity. 
9. Hence, despite the errors in the log, they do not definitively indicate an abnormal state.

1. Analyze the log entry to understand the context and the nature of the error.
2. Identify the key issues in the log:
   - Multiple occurrences of "java.lang.IllegalStateException: client not in a usable state"
   - A "java.net.SocketException: Broken pipe" at the end
3. Determine if these issues indicate normal operation or an abnormal condition.
4. "java.lang.IllegalStateException: client not in a usable state" suggests that the client is in an unexpected state, which is not expected in normal operation.
5. "java.net.SocketException: Broken pipe" is typically an error indicating that a remote party has initiated a graceful shutdown of the connection, which is generally not a normal occurrence in ongoing operations.
6. Given that these errors are recurring and indicate unexpected states and potential connection issues, they do not align with normal operation.

1. Analyze the log entry: "Cannot MOUNTPROG RPC (tcp): RPC: Program not registered".
2. Identify key elements: The log indicates an issue with a program registration in the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) system.
3. Determine the severity: This error suggests that a required program is missing or not properly registered, which would prevent certain operations from functioning correctly.
4. Compare to normal vs. abnormal criteria: A missing or unregistered program would typically indicate an abnormal condition as it disrupts the expected operation of the system.
5. But, wait, let’s pause and examine this more carefully. The ground-truth indicates that this log entry is categorized as "normal".
6. This suggests that the presence of the error message does not necessarily imply an abnormal state. It could occur under normal circumstances, perhaps indicating a temporary issue that does not impact the overall functionality of the system.
7. Therefore, I need to adjust my understanding of when a log entry is categorized as abnormal. If the system can still function correctly without the registered program, then this should be classified as "normal".

First, we need to analyze the log entries to determine if they indicate a normal or abnormal state of the node card. The log states that "PGOOD IS NOT ASSERTED" and "PGOOD ERROR LATCH IS ACTIVE." This situation typically suggests an issue with power supply stability, as the PGOOD signal indicates whether the power is stable and the card is operational.

However, let’s pause and consider what we know so far. The log also indicates that "MPGOOD is OK," along with the status of the voltage rails (2.5 volt and 1.5 volt) being "OK." This suggests that while there is a problem with the PGOOD signal, the other voltage supplies are functioning correctly.
