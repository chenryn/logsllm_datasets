1. Analyze the log entry:
   - The log entry is "DRNI/6/DRNI_IFEVENT_DR_UNBIND:Interface [STRING] was removed from DR group [UINT32]."
   - This indicates that a specific interface was removed from a DR (Designated Router) group, where the interface is identified by a string and the group by an unsigned integer.

2. Analyze the input description:
   - The description states "A Layer 2 aggregate interface was removed from a DR group."
   - This specifies that the type of interface removed is a Layer 2 aggregate interface.

3. Compare the log entry and the description:
   - The log entry confirms that an interface was removed from a DR group, but it does not specify the type of the interface.
   - The description adds that the interface is specifically a Layer 2 aggregate, which is additional information not found in the log entry.

4. Determine if the description is a valid explanation:
   - Wait a second, let’s ensure this is right. The log entry indicates an interface was removed, but it does not preclude the possibility that the interface might be a Layer 2 aggregate. 
   - The absence of type specification in the log entry does not invalidate the description because the removal of a Layer 2 aggregate interface still falls under the general category of "an interface removed from a DR group."

5. Since the log does not contradict the description, but also does not affirmatively confirm the additional detail, the description can still be considered consistent with the information provided in the log.

6. Therefore, the conclusion should be that the description is a valid explanation of the log entry, despite the additional detail.

 True

<solutions> 
1. Start by analyzing the log entry to understand its content thoroughly.
2. The log entry states, "LB/5/ LB_CHANGE_READ_WRITE_STATE_VS: The state of server farm associated with virtual server [STRING] ([STRING], port: [USHORT]) was changed, read server farm is [STRING], write server farm is [STRING], current read-write server farm is [STRING]." This indicates that there has been a change in the overall state of the server farms associated with a virtual server.
3. Next, look at the input description: "The health state of the read and write server farms changed."
4. Now, evaluate whether the description accurately reflects what is communicated in the log entry.
5. The log recognizes a change in the states of the server farms. Importantly, it does not specifically mention 'health' as the nature of the change—it merely discusses the state itself.
6. This presents a potential issue because while the description suggests a specific area of state change (health), the log could refer to various types of state changes that are not limited to health alone.
7. But, wait, let’s pause and examine this more carefully. 
8. The log mentions changes in the state of the server farms but does not clarify that this change is specifically about their health state. Therefore, the description's emphasis on "health state" might be an incorrect assumption about the log's content. 
9. Thus, the description does not accurately encompass the change described in the log when considering the broader types of state changes that could occur.
10. By applying the exclusion method, we can conclude that although the log and description both relate to a change in server farms, the description's specificity about health does not match the generality of the log entry. Hence, the description is not a valid explanation of the log.
 False
