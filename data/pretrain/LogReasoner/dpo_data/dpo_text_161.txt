1. First, we need to identify the key components in the log message that can help us determine the type of alert. The log message is "ENTITYTRAP/6/OPTICALINVALIDRESUME: OID [oid] Optical Module resume from invalid situation.(Index=[INTEGER], EntityPhysicalIndex=[INTEGER], PhysicalName="[OCTET]", EntityTrapFaultID=136196)".
2. Key components to focus on are "ENTITYTRAP", which suggests a trap related to an entity, and "Optical Module resume from invalid situation", which indicates a specific event or state change.
3. Reviewing the provided list of alert types, we see that "Event Trap" is the most fitting category for this log message. The log is essentially reporting an event that has occurred (an optical module resuming from an invalid state), and it is classified as a trap, which aligns with the "Event Trap" category.
4. But, wait, let’s pause and examine this more carefully. 
5. The term "Optical Module resume from invalid situation" indicates that there is an issue with the equipment, specifically the optical module, which suggests it might be a problem that relates directly to the equipment status.
6. Referring to the provided list of alert types again, "equipmentAlarm" is specifically meant for alerts that signal issues with equipment. Given that the log describes a situation where an optical module resumes function from an invalid state, it aligns more closely to an equipment fault than an event trap.
7. Therefore, we can conclude that the correct alert type for this log message is "equipmentAlarm".

1. First, let's examine the log message: "WLAN/6/BLE_OFFLINE_RESTORE: OID [oid] The BLE site recovers. (BLEMAC=[OPAQUE])".
2. The log indicates an event under the WLAN category, specifically related to BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) technology.
3. The phrase "The BLE site recovers" implies that a previous problem has been resolved, which is a significant change in the operational status.
4. At this point, it might seem logical to classify it as an 'Event Trap' because it signifies recovery from an offline state, but let's take a closer look.
5. Wait a second, let’s ensure this is right. Calculating carefully: 
6. The key understanding required here is that the term "recovers" indicates that there was an issue with the BLE site before, which aligns more closely with a failure or malfunction of equipment.
7. The presence of "offline" indicates an operational failure that has been remedied, which is indicative of an 'equipmentAlarm'.
8. Therefore, we can exclude 'Event Trap' as it does not convey the context of prior malfunction but rather reports a recovery state from an alarm condition. 
9. Thus, the correct classification for this log message should be 'equipmentAlarm'.
