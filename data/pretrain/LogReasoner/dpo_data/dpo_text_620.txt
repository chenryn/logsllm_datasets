1. First, let's carefully analyze the log entry: The log states that a local certificate will be valid in a certain number of days. This means that currently, the certificate is not yet effective or active.
2. Next, let's examine the description: It claims that the local certificate has not taken effect, indicating that the certificate is indeed not active at this moment.
3. Now, we should compare the log entry and the description: The log entry states future validity, suggesting that the certificate is not valid right now, while the description confirms that the certificate has not yet taken effect. 
4. Considering this, both the log entry and the description address the same state of the certificate — that it is not currently active. Therefore, they correlate directly in capturing the essence of the situation. 
5. So, we find that the description accurately reflects the meaning of the log entry. Hence, it should be classified as a valid explanation.
 True

1. Begin by analyzing the log entry which states, "Requesting certificate through CMPv2 succeeded." This indicates that a certificate request was successfully made using the CMPv2 protocol.
2. The log entry includes additional details such as parameters related to the CMP request, which are not directly relevant to the core message of success.
3. Now, let's compare the provided description: "The local certificate is successfully applied for using CMPv2." 
4. This description implies that the certificate has not only been requested but also applied. However, the log mentions only the success of the request, not the application of the certificate itself.
5. Wait, this doesn’t seem right. Let’s pause and consider what we know so far. The key point in the log is the successful request, while the description expands on that by discussing the application of the certificate, which is not supported by the log entry. Hence, the description introduces an assumption not present in the log.
6. Therefore, the description does not accurately reflect the log entry's content as it implies a step (application) that is not confirmed by the log. Based on this analysis, we conclude that the description is not a valid explanation of the log entry.
