1. Analyze the log entry to identify any unusual or unexpected events.
2. The log entry states "server dropped connection without sending the initial greeting". This indicates that the server closed the connection unexpectedly before sending the necessary initial information.
3. Compare this situation to normal server behavior, which generally involves sending an initial greeting to establish the connection. 
4. At this point, we need to evaluate if the absence of an initial greeting always indicates an issue or if it might occur in certain circumstances that are still considered normal. 
5. Wait a second, let’s ensure this is right. Calculating carefully: a server can drop connections for various reasons, including timeouts or normal closure scenarios, which may not necessarily denote a fault.
6. According to the ground-truth, this log is classified as "normal", suggesting that this situation may occur under acceptable conditions.
7. Therefore, we need to conclude that this log entry is not indicative of an abnormal event as it may fall within the parameters of normal server operation.

The input log " <*> pages." is presented, and we need to analyze it to determine its categorization as either normal or abnormal. Initially, it's noted that the log entry appears to be incomplete. However, let's delve deeper into what information we do have.

1. The phrase "pages" typically indicates some sort of content or data being referenced. In many systems, logs related to page loads, page requests, or similar actions are common and can often be classified as normal if there are no accompanying error messages or alerts.

2. The context here is crucial. Since there is no error message, warning, or indication of malfunction associated with the log entry, we might consider that the absence of such factors suggests a normal activity rather than an abnormal one.

3. Now, focusing on the idea that logs are typically categorized based on their context, we find that many logs simply indicating actions performed (like page loads) without errors generally fall into the normal category.

But, wait, let’s pause and examine this more carefully. We need to consider that while the log entry by itself appears minimal, in the context of log analysis, it does not inherently suggest an error or abnormality. The absence of any indication of an issue means we lean towards categorizing it as normal.

4. Therefore, given the lack of additional context suggesting a malfunction or abnormal behavior, we can conclude that the log entry should indeed be classified as normal.

In summary, analyzing the log entry based on the absence of errors and typical log behavior leads us to categorize it correctly.
