1. Let's begin by analyzing the log entry: "ciod: LOGIN <*> failed: No such file or directory". 
2. The entry indicates a login attempt that failed due to a missing file or directory. 
3. At this point, it seems reasonable to conclude that a failed login must be abnormal. 
4. However, this doesn’t seem right. Let’s pause and consider what we know so far.
5. A failed login due to no such file or directory does not necessarily indicate unauthorized access or an attack; it could simply be due to a legitimate misconfiguration or a harmless mistake, such as a user trying to access a non-existent resource.
6. In many systems, this type of log might be common and might not be indicative of a serious issue. 
7. Therefore, we should categorize this log entry as normal since it does not involve any malicious behavior or security breach.

To determine if the log entry "nfsd: last server has exited" is normal or abnormal, let’s analyze it step-by-step.

1. **Understanding the Log Entry**: The log entry indicates that the last NFS (Network File System) server has shut down or stopped serving requests.

2. **Context and Implications**:
   - NFS is a protocol used for file sharing between computers in a network.
   - The message suggests that there are no NFS services currently available for clients.

3. **Normal vs. Abnormal**:
   - **Normal**: If this exit was due to planned maintenance or is part of an expected operation (like a scheduled shutdown or reboot), it would be normal.
   - **Abnormal**: If the exit was unexpected, such as due to a crash, it would be abnormal.

However, wait a second, let’s ensure this is right. The log explicitly states the last server has exited, but it does not inherently indicate a problem. In many systems, it is normal for NFS servers to exit during planned maintenance or system updates.

Therefore, we need to consider that in many environments, the exit of the last server might not signify a critical issue unless there are explicit indicators of malfunction or unexpected behavior. Hence, categorizing it as abnormal without further context is an overreach.

To investigate further:
- If the log entry was part of a routine maintenance report or if there were prior notifications about server shutdowns, it supports the interpretation of being normal.
- Without any evidence of unexpected behavior or system alerts indicating a failure, this log entry is typically a benign state.

Thus, concluding that the log entry "nfsd: last server has exited" is categorized as normal, as there is no concrete evidence of an issue without further context.
