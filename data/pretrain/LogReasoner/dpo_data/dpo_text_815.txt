To determine the severity of the log message, we need to analyze the keywords and the context of the message. The log message provided is: "SSLVPN/6/SSLVPN_CLR_HTTPREDIRECT:Disabled HTTP-redirect in gateway [STRING]".

1. **Identify the severity level**: The log level is indicated by the second part of the log (e.g., /6/). Here, the number 6 is a common indicator for a warning level in many logging systems.
2. **Context and content**: The message is informing that HTTP-redirects have been disabled in the gateway. While this is a change in behavior, it is not indicating an immediate fault or error. It is more of an operational change that might affect users or operations.

Based on these points, the log message is a warning, indicating that some events or operations may lead to faults.

But, wait, let’s pause and examine this more carefully. We need to reconsider the implications of the statement "Disabled HTTP-redirect in gateway [STRING]". This phrase does not indicate a fault or an error but rather describes a configuration setting that has been changed. 

3. **Evaluating Severity**: Informational messages typically denote operational changes or state updates without implying an error. Therefore, in this context, "Disabled HTTP-redirect" is a routine log entry rather than a critical issue that necessitates further action.

By applying this reasoning, we conclude that this log does not represent a warning, error, or critical fault, but is rather an informational message.

1. Identify the key components of the log message: 
   - PKTCPT/6/PKTCPT_OPEN_FAIL: This is the event identifier.
   - Failed to start packet capture: This is the event description.
   - Reason: File for storing captured frames not opened: This provides the cause of the failure.
   
2. Determine the severity based on the event description and reason:
   - The event description indicates that packet capture failed.
   - The reason specifies that the file for storing captured frames was not opened, which explains why the packet capture could not start.
   
3. Assess the severity level:
   - Wait, this doesn’t seem right. Let’s pause and consider what we know so far. 
   - The failure to start packet capture does indicate a problem; however, it is essential to consider the context. The log says "Failed to start packet capture," which might seem severe, but the specific reason given (the file not being opened) suggests it's a result of a configuration or setup issue rather than a critical fault in the system itself.
   - Since the log does not indicate an immediate threat to system integrity or severe operational issues, we classify it as an informational message rather than an error.
   
4. Conclude:
   - The severity level is not indicating a critical issue but rather an operational concern that can be addressed without immediate repercussions. Thus, it should be classified as a non-error message.
