1. First, we need to understand what "LoginGraceTime exceeded" means. This phrase typically indicates that a system's grace period for login attempts has been exceeded.
2. In many security configurations, there is a grace period during which login attempts are allowed. If this grace period is exceeded, it usually means that too many failed login attempts have been made or that the login attempt was made after the allowed period.
3. Wait a second, let’s ensure this is right. Calculating carefully:
4. The term "LoginGraceTime exceeded" does suggest that there were attempts to log in, but it doesn't automatically signify an abnormal event. The definition of "normal" in this context can vary based on the system's configurations.
5. In some configurations, exceeding the grace period can be part of normal operations if it’s expected behavior, such as during maintenance or testing periods.
6. We need to evaluate the context of the log entry against the provided ground-truth, which indicates that this situation is classified as "normal."
7. Therefore, we can conclude that this log entry should be categorized as "normal" because it does not necessarily reflect an error or abnormal system behavior.

To determine if the log entry is normal or abnormal, let's analyze the provided log entries step-by-step.

1. The hexadecimal log entries are:
   - 20:001f684c
   - 21:00000003
   - 22:0feea9fc
   - 23:001f65d8

2. Converting each hexadecimal number to its decimal equivalent:
   - 1f684c (hex) = 2051044 (dec)
   - 00000003 (hex) = 3 (dec)
   - 0feea9fc (hex) = 408241772 (dec)
   - 001f65d8 (hex) = 2051048 (dec)

3. Now, let's analyze these values:
   - The first value (2051044) and the last value (2051048) are indeed very close to each other, indicating a potential sequence or normal behavior.
   - The second value (3) is quite small compared to the first and last values, but it is important to consider context to understand if this difference is significant.
   - The third value (408241772) is much larger than the other values, which raises a question about whether this represents a different type of data.

But, wait, let’s pause and examine this more carefully. 

4. We must consider the context of how these logs are typically structured. If the logs represent a sequence where one is expected to be significantly larger (like an error code or a different metric), the presence of such a large number could be normal. Alternatively, if these entries are all expected to represent similar data types, the large difference could suggest an issue.

5. Evaluating the overall pattern:
   - The first and last entries being close suggests normalcy in that range.
   - The second entry, while small, does not directly indicate an anomaly by itself without further context on expected values.
   - The large third entry needs to be assessed against the expected range of values.

6. Since the provided ground-truth indicates that the log is classified as "normal," and upon recognizing that the variance in values may not inherently indicate an abnormality without further context that confirms what constitutes normal operation, we can conclude that:

- The overall pattern does not necessarily indicate an abnormal state. 

Hence, the log entry is deemed normal.
