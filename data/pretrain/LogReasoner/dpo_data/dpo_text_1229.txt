To determine if the log entry is normal or abnormal, we need to analyze the content and context of the log. The log entry provided is "Swap cache: add <*> delete <*> find <*> race <*>".

1. **Understanding the Log Content**: The log entry describes operations related to a swap cache, which is a part of the system's memory management. The operations mentioned are "add", "delete", "find", and "race". 

2. **Analyzing Each Operation**:
   - **Add**: This operation involves adding data to the swap cache. This is a common and expected operation.
   - **Delete**: This operation involves removing data from the swap cache. This is also a common and expected operation.
   - **Find**: This operation involves searching for data within the swap cache. Again, this is a common and expected operation.
   - **Race**: At this point, I need to reconsider the nature of the "race" operation. 

Wait, this doesn’t seem right. Let’s pause and consider what we know so far.

3. **Re-evaluating the "Race" Operation**: The term "race" in this context could imply a race condition, which could suggest a problem. However, it's crucial to consider the overall context of the log entry. In a well-functioning system, a swap cache might indeed register race conditions as part of its normal operations, especially under high load or concurrent access situations. 

4. **Contextual Interpretation**: Given that "add", "delete", and "find" are all standard operations, the presence of "race" could simply denote a typical occurrence in a system that handles multiple threads or processes. Instead of marking this log as abnormal solely due to one word, we should look at the overall context—systems often log race conditions without indicating a failure.

5. **Conclusion**: After analyzing the operations again, including the implications of "race", it's more accurate to categorize this log entry as a normal operation within the expected behavior of a swap cache. 

Thus, the log entry should be classified as normal.
