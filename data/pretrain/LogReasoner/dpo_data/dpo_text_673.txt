1. Let's carefully analyze the input log entry, which states that a member port of an aggregation group changed to the inactive state due to its physical state being down.
2. The description provided states that a member port in an aggregation group changed to the "Unselected" state because the port went down.
3. Initially, both the log and the description describe a change in state due to the port going down, suggesting they are related.
4. However, this is where we need to pause and consider what we know so far. The log specifically refers to the state as "inactive," while the description refers to it as "Unselected."
5. We need to determine if "inactive" and "Unselected" refer to the same state. Typically, in networking terminology, "inactive" indicates that a port is not currently in use, while "Unselected" may imply that it is not chosen as part of the active group, which could be a different status.
6. Given that the terms are distinct and refer to different states, we can exclude the possibility that they are the same.
7. Therefore, the description does not accurately reflect the log entry's content regarding the state of the member port.
8. Based on this analysis, we conclude that the description fails to serve as a valid explanation for the log entry.
 False

1. Start by analyzing the content and context of the log entry.
   - The log entry indicates that an OSPF error message was received and subsequently discarded, which is significant for network routing and stability.
2. Break down the components of the log entry for clarity.
   - Key elements include the ProcessId, MsgType, ErrMsgCnt, LocalComp, and PeerComp, which provide technical details about the specific OSPF process and the nature of the message.
3. Now, let's compare the log entry with the provided description.
   - The description states, "An interface discarded the received error messages." This implies a specific interface was responsible for the action of discarding.
4. Evaluate the accuracy of the description in relation to the log entry.
   - The log does not specify any interface responsible for discarding the error messages; instead, it focuses on the OSPF process and its components. 
   - Therefore, although the action of discarding is correct, attributing this action to a specific interface is misleading.
5. Conclude whether the description serves as a valid explanation or direct description of the log entry.
   - Since the log entry does not support the claim about an interface, the description fails to accurately reflect the log's content, leading to the conclusion that it is not a valid explanation.
 False
