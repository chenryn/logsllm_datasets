### Introduction
- **Sun Tzu's "The Art of War"**
  - "All warfare is based on deception. When able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near. Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him."

### The History of the 36 Stratagems
- **Cultural Contributions:**
  - France: Cooking
  - Italy: Painting
  - China: Military Strategy

### The History of Social Engineering
- From ancient times, social engineering has been used as an effective form of attack.
  - **Amenhotep III**: The first Trojan attack
  - **Bards**: Masters of the (S.E.) craft

### How Social Engineering Differs Between Cultures
- **Asia**: Saving face = Losing secrets
- **Europe**: Command = Control
- **North America**: Do unto others = Before they do to you
- **South America**: Mutual benefit = An uneven outcome

### The New OSI Model
- **Layer 1-6**: Overused, time for a new vector.
- **Layer 7**: Good but getting better defended.
- **Layer 8**: Less guarded and can’t be patched ;-)

### Top 5 Stratagems Relating to Social Engineering

#### 3. "Killing with a Borrowed Knife" (借刀杀人)
- **Strategy**: Turn an enemy's asset against them (e.g., let the employee be the attack vector).

#### 5. "Looting a House on Fire" (趁火打劫)
- **Strategy**: Layoffs and acquisitions create the proper chaos for a subtle attack.

#### 15. "Luring a Tiger from Its Lair in the Mountain" (调虎离山)
- **Strategy**: Wait for the worker to take their network (laptop) to you.

#### 17. "Tossing Out a Brick to Get a Jade" (抛砖引玉)
- **Strategy**: A $15.00 USB could return an investment of $5,000,000 if cast out to the right “lucky” person.

#### 36. "Escape - The Best Scheme" (走为上)
- **Strategy**: Every plan should have an exit strategy in case the attack fails, especially in the real world.

### Conclusion
- **Next Steps**: What can we do now?
- **Quote**: "Without understanding where the opponent's weaknesses are, you cannot borrow their strength to use against them." - Cheng Man Ching
