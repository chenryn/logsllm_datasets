### Sensitive Data and Detection Mechanisms

Sensitive data can be compromised through various means, including code vulnerabilities such as code injection [20], improper certificate validation [14], and library vulnerabilities [28]. Tools like SUPOR [19] and UiRef [4] have been developed to detect these leakages. Additionally, data leakage can occur due to the exploitation of server-side vulnerabilities, where sensitive information is inadvertently shared with mobile apps. For example, Kock et al. [22] proposed a semi-automated method combining static and dynamic analysis to identify server-based information oversharing, where private customer data was unintentionally sent to mobile apps. Improper implementation of access control mechanisms on the server side can also lead to data leakage, as demonstrated in studies like AuthScope [43] and LeakScope [41]. Our work builds on these findings but focuses specifically on the context of ride-hailing services, an area that has not been extensively explored.

### Web API and Protocol Reverse Engineering

To conduct our study, we developed a lightweight dynamic analysis tool to reverse engineer remote server web APIs for privacy-sensitive data analysis. This approach is supported by a significant body of research on network protocol reverse engineering from both network traces and application binary executions. Tools like Discoverer [9] and Protocol Informatics [2] extract protocol formats from network traces, while Polyglot [7], AutoFormat [24], Dispatcher [6], and Reformat [36] focus on how network messages are processed by the application binary. Recently, WARDroid [27] introduced a static-analysis-based method for extracting web APIs, but it primarily focuses on implementation logic, which is not our primary goal. However, our technique can integrate these methods to recognize message formats in addition to discovering web APIs.

### Dynamic Analysis of Mobile Apps

Our approach leverages dynamic analysis to identify web APIs and dependencies. Similar techniques have been used in the past to address specific security issues. For instance, TaintDroid [13] detects whether user's privacy-sensitive information is leaked outside the phone; AppsPlayground [32] recognizes user interfaces and generates inputs to expose more app behaviors; DECAF [25] navigates various activities to discover potential ad flaws; and SmartGen [40] uses selective concolic execution to expose malicious URLs.

Our approach differs from these existing techniques in two key ways:
1. We focus on extracting web APIs, including parameter roles, from mobile apps.
2. Each work faces unique challenges. For example, we do not aim to execute all possible program paths of a mobile app, instead relying on security analysts to execute the app. We can integrate existing efforts like SmartGen [40] to more efficiently and automatically expose web APIs.

### Conclusion

We have conducted a large-scale study on the privacy-sensitive data leakage of drivers in ride-hailing services, focusing on the "nearby cars" feature. Our study, which included 20 ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft, revealed that data harvesting attacks are feasible. These attacks pose a real threat to driver safety, as they can determine high-precision locations, including home addresses, and detect daily behaviors. Some services also leak other confidential information, such as social security numbers. Furthermore, attackers can learn aggregated business information, such as the number of rides, car utilization, and service presence. In addition to evaluating current countermeasures and reporting our findings, we have discussed more robust countermeasures that service providers could implement to mitigate these threats.
