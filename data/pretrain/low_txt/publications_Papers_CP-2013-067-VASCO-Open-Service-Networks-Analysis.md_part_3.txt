### 5.4 Service Value Networks

While the previous three sections focused on structural aspects, such as the analysis, optimization, and evolution of service networks, they did not consider the participants' behavior within these networks. For example, depending on the market mechanism implemented in a service marketplace, providers might be incentivized to misreport their service characteristics (such as price, non-functional attributes, etc.) to increase their chances of being allocated. Therefore, the market mechanism must be able to handle such behavior while still yielding an efficient market outcome. This is the focus of the economic concept of Service Value Networks (SVNs, see [3, 14, 13]).

**Definition of SVNs:**
Service Value Networks (SVNs) are defined as "Smart Business Networks that provide business value by performing automated on-demand composition of complex services from a steady but open pool of complementary and substitutive standardized service modules through a universally accessible network orchestration platform" [14]. The setup is similar to Figure 1. The main constituents of SVNs include:
- **Service Providers:** Offer atomic or complex services.
- **Service Aggregators:** Perform the (automatic) composition of (atomic) services to create complex service compositions.
- **Service Consumers:** Request either atomic services or aggregated services with specific functionalities and have preferences over service attributes (e.g., acceptable price range, availability thresholds, etc.).

**Figure 5: Service Value Network and Combination of Atomic Services to Aggregated Services**

The abstract model and topology of service aggregation in SVNs are illustrated in Figure 5. When a consumer requests an aggregated service consisting of two service functionalities, there are two candidate pools of atomic services from different service providers. From a Mechanism Design perspective, the challenge is to select a combination of these atomic services that best satisfies the consumer's requirements. In SVNs, this is achieved through a "complex service auction" [3].

**Mechanism Design in SVNs:**
The primary goal of the mechanism is to maximize the welfare of the SVN, which is the sum of consumer and provider utilities. The provider utility depends on the costs of service provisioning and the revenue generated. The consumer utility is calculated as the difference between the consumer's monetary valuation of the aggregated service and its price. Each customer has a certain valuation (maximum willingness to pay) for a perfect service, i.e., a service that fully meets or exceeds the requirements. This valuation is then multiplied by the score (ranging from 0 to 1) for the actual aggregated service, which reflects how closely the aggregated service attributes match the consumer's requirements.

**Mechanism Implementation:**
The mechanism involves two steps:
1. **Allocation Calculation:**
   - The mechanism computes different potential combinations of atomic services to form the desired aggregated service. The aggregation operation of service attributes depends on the attribute type (e.g., the price for the aggregated service is the sum of prices for the atomic services).
   - The mechanism selects the aggregated service with the highest positive difference between the consumer's valuation and the costs of the atomic services.

2. **Payment Calculation:**
   - The mechanism implements a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) payment scheme to determine the actual payments to the providers of the allocated atomic services.
   - The VCG scheme is desirable because it incentivizes service providers to report their service attributes and prices truthfully to the marketplace without the incentive to manipulate. This is achieved by rewarding service providers according to their relative importance (added value) to the SVN, allowing them to receive an additional discount on their service provisioning price.

**Properties of the Mechanism:**
- **Allocative Efficiency:** The mechanism selects the best combination of atomic services given the consumer preferences.
- **Strategy-Proofness:** The dominant strategy for service providers is to submit their service attributes truthfully to the marketplace, as other strategies will not yield better outcomes for the providers.
- **Budget-Balance:** However, the Impossibility Result by [16] shows that such a mechanism is not budget-balanced. In certain circumstances, the discounts to the providers, combined with the price for the allocated atomic services, may exceed consumer payments. In such cases, the market would need to be externally subsidized, which might not be practical for many scenarios. Implementing other payment schemes to achieve budget-balance can lead to a loss of strategy-proofness, resulting in complex strategic behavior.

**Research on SVNs:**
Service Network Analysis has been applied to various research questions related to SVNs. For instance, Conte et al. [9] propose a scheme that rewards service providers to participate in SVNs, even if their services are not selected. The value of each service provider is calculated through a metric that serves as a proxy for the relative power of the provider in the network. Once service providers are participating in the SVN, their goal is to be allocated and receive revenues from their allocated services. Haas et al. [13] show that through appropriate learning strategies, providers can adjust to (potentially time-dependent) consumer requirements and even tacitly collude by dividing existing market segments among themselves.

**Future Directions:**
While current work on SVNs has mainly focused on economic topics, augmenting the SVN concept with semantic capabilities to create Open Semantic Service Networks (OSSNs) and using Social Network Analysis could be fruitful. Such an amalgamation would enable a better description and usability of SVNs and improve our understanding of their dynamic behavior.

### 6 Related Work

Most existing approaches fail to adhere to service-dominant logic [18] and focus too much inward on the company rather than the service network they belong to (c.f. [12, 1, 10, 11, 17]). Service networks are not viewed as global structures. Furthermore, efforts to analyze networks have been carried out as isolated activities from the Business Process Management (BPM) field (e.g., [10]) or from an economic perspective (e.g., [11, 17]).

**Examples of Existing Approaches:**
- **e3service [12]:** Provides an ontology to model e-business models and services. The model targets simple relations between services from an internal perspective, such as core-enhancing, core-supporting, and substitute. From an external perspective, the value chains proposed do not explicitly capture service networks across agents and do not attempt to quantify the effect of relationships.
- **Service Network Notation (SNN) [10]:** Looks at service networks from BPM and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) perspectives. SNN provides UML artifacts to model value chain relationships of economic value. These relationships are considered 'weak' as they only capture offerings and rewards between services. The notation is used to describe how a new service can be composed from a network of existing services, focusing on compositions, processes, and creating new services using BPM to describe the interactions of existing SOA-based services.
- **Graph-Based Notation [1]:** Verna Allee uses a graph-based notation to model value flows within a network of agents, such as the exchange of goods, services, revenue, knowledge, and intangible values. Weill and Vitale [21] developed a formalism called the e-business model schematic to analyze businesses. The schematic is a graphical representation aiming to identify important elements of a business model, including firm relationships with suppliers and allies, benefits each participant receives, and major flows of product, information, and money. Both approaches only take into account value flows and do not consider other types of relationships that can be established between agents.

**Business Perspective:**
There is a trend for companies, particularly service providers, to specialize by focusing on core competencies and becoming members of adaptable networks [11]. As the transition to such networks of specialized service providers leads to challenges and new requirements for business models and service components, the field of service networks has been identified as an important research priority [17].

**Challenges:**
A significant challenge yet to be solved involves modeling and optimizing the functions of service-centric organizations from technological, business, and legal points of view, extending work on optimizing Web processes [19]. Semantic Web technologies need to be extended to provide or support large-scale modeling, analytics, and optimization. New approaches are needed to express and quantify the impact one service has on other services, as well as to understand the collective behavior and performance/profitability characteristics of service networks.

### 7 Conclusions

We envision a world well-connected via global OSSNs, where semantics play a major role in creating a large-scale and integrated service network. Organizations, groups, and individuals will have tools and platforms to advertise their know-how, capabilities, and skills in the form of services. A vast number of detailed, firm-generated (or even user-generated) services will be available worldwide. Some services will be shared, composed, co-created, personalized, or crowdsourced.

As service networks emerge, their study will enable us to understand how a service-based society grows and changes over time. Service Network Analysis (SNA) can provide theories, mathematical models, algorithms, techniques, and tools to achieve this goal. This paper presented four applications of SNA: optimization, evolution, network effect, and service value. Optimization aims to construct networks of services that minimize overall costs. Network evolution studies and forecasts how a network structure will evolve over time. Network effect explores the impact of changing the characteristics of one or more service nodes on other services and the network itself. Finally, service value networks enable the analysis of the influence of providers' strategies on the network. These four methods provide the first building blocks to demonstrate the practical application of SNA to better understand how service networks function in a global, interconnected service-based society.
