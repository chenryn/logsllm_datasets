**Abstract:**
Relay attackers can intercept and forward messages between a contactless EMV bank card and a shop reader, enabling unauthorized transactions. To counter this, Apple Pay requires biometric authentication (fingerprint or Face ID) for payments, while Mastercard and Visa have proposed protocols to prevent relay attacks. This paper investigates the vulnerabilities in transport payment modes and demonstrates that it is possible to bypass the Apple Pay lock screen and illicitly make payments from a locked iPhone to any EMV reader without user authorization. We show that Visa's proposed relay-countermeasure can be bypassed using rooted smartphones. We also analyze Mastercard's relay protection and propose a new Level 1 Relay-Resistance Protocol (L1RP) for EMV. Our L1RP protocol combines elements from both Visa's and Mastercard's relay protections, leveraging a timed nonce-exchange at the ISO 14443 Level 1 part of the EMV protocol. We formally verify our L1RP protocol using Tamarin and provide practical evidence of its feasibility.

**Introduction:**
Contactless EMV payments are becoming increasingly popular due to their convenience. However, they also present an expanded attack surface, particularly for relay attackers who can intercept and forward messages between cards and readers without the owner's knowledge. Smartphones generally require user authentication (e.g., fingerprint, PIN, or Face ID) for payments, which mitigates the risk of relay attacks. 

Apple Pay introduced the "Express Transit/Travel" feature in iOS 12.3, allowing users to make payments at transport ticket barriers without unlocking their phones. Samsung introduced a similar feature in October 2019. We refer to this as "Transport mode." We found that Transport for London (TfL) ticket-gate readers broadcast a non-standard sequence of bytes, known as "magic bytes," which can bypass the Apple Pay lock screen. For Apple Pay Visa, we demonstrate how to alter, replay, and relay both ISO 14443 Level 1 and EMV protocol Level 3 messages to perform fraudulent transactions.

**Contributions:**
1. **Explanation of Transit/Transport Mode and Issuer Application Data (IAD):** We detail how these features work in the EMV standard.
2. **Bypassing the Apple Pay Lock Screen:** We show how to take any amount of money from a Visa card on a locked iPhone.
3. **Insecurity of Visa's Relay-Protected Protocol:** We demonstrate that Visa's Level 1 relay-protected protocol is vulnerable to attacks using rooted phones.
4. **EMV Distance Bounding at Level 1:** We show that distance bounding can be more reliably implemented at the ISO 14443 Level 1 rather than the EMV protocol Level 3.
5. **Proposed L1RP Protocol:** We introduce a new Level 1 distance bounding protocol for EMV, combining elements from Visa's and Mastercard's relay protections.

**Background:**
### Overview of EMV
The EMV standard encompasses various protocols and variations. We focus on the versions of Mastercard’s PayPass and Visa’s PayWave observed in mobile phone transaction traces.

#### Mastercard's Protocol
- **ISO 14443-3 Anti-Collision Protocol:** The card and the bank share a symmetric key \( K_M \), and the card has a certificate chain for a public key, which the reader can verify.
- **Initial Messages:** The first two messages select the payment application (Mastercard). The reader sends a Get Processing Options (GPO) message with terminal-specific information, and the payment device responds with the Application File Locator (AFL) and Application Interchange Profile (AIP).
- **Record Requests:** The reader requests records listed in the AFL, including "Track 2" (user's account information) and the Card Risk Management Data Object List 1 (CDOL1), which includes the transaction amount and an Unpredictable Number (UN) from the reader.

**Conclusion:**
We have identified significant vulnerabilities in the current EMV relay protection mechanisms and proposed a new, more secure L1RP protocol. Our findings highlight the need for robust relay countermeasures in contactless payment systems. We have disclosed our findings to Apple and Visa and provided formal verification and practical implementation of our proposed solution.
