### Compromise Detection and Employee Behavior Modeling

One approach to detecting compromised accounts involves modeling employee behavior and identifying anomalies in outbound emails. When an anomaly is detected, the system prompts the employee to re-authenticate using two-factor authentication. However, this method suffers from high false positive rates (ranging from 1% to 8%, compared to the much lower rate of 1 in millions of emails in BEC-Guard). Additionally, the analysis is based on a relatively small corpus of emails.

### Barracuda Networks Study

Another contemporary study conducted by Ho et al. at Barracuda Networks [18, 19] examines the behavior of attackers who use compromised accounts and explores methods to detect account takeover incidents. The techniques presented in this study complement our work, focusing on a different type of attack.

### Adversarial Learning in Spam Detection

There is a significant body of research on adversarial learning in the context of spam detection [3, 4, 8, 21, 31, 32, 37, 50], which is relevant to our work. In future developments, we plan to incorporate some of the evasion techniques introduced in past studies, such as randomization and the use of honeypots to deceive adversaries.

### Conclusions

Business Email Compromise (BEC) is a significant cybersecurity threat that results in billions of dollars in losses annually. We present BEC-Guard, the first system that detects a wide variety of BEC attacks with high precision and low false positive rates. BEC-Guard is currently used by thousands of organizations and prevents these attacks in real-time using a novel API-based architecture combined with supervised learning.

One of the key lessons learned from developing and deploying BEC-Guard is that attackers continuously adapt their tactics and approaches. While our supervised learning approach requires continuous retraining of classifiers and is not fully generalizable, we have found that using historical email patterns via an API-based architecture is highly effective in quickly developing new classifiers for evolving threats. We have applied a similar approach in other contexts, such as detecting brand impersonation, generic sender names, and account takeovers.
