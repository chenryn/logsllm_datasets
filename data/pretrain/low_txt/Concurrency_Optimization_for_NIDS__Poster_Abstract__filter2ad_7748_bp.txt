**P-411: NMR and Mass-based Metabolomics Applied to the Quality Control of Processed Ginseng**

**Presenting Author:**
- Dae Young Lee, Department of Herbal Crop Research, National Institute of Horticultural and Herbal Science, RDA, South Korea

**Co-Authors:**
- Dahye Yoon, Bo-Ram Choi, Jae-Suk Ban, Ryong Gong, Young-Seob Lee, Geum-Soog Kim

**Abstract:**
The root of *Panax ginseng* C.A. Meyer is widely used in traditional medicines and functional foods. Both raw and processed ginseng products are utilized in the food industry and herbal markets. Different processing methods yield four types of ginseng: white ginseng (WG), tae-geuk ginseng (TG), red ginseng (RG), and black ginseng (BG). This study employed high-resolution magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (HR-MAS NMR) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF/MS) to assess the metabolic compositions of these processed ginseng products.

**Results:**
- HR-MAS NMR identified primary metabolites such as sugars and amino acids.
- Principal component analysis (PCA) score plots showed that TG and RG were clustered together, distinct from WG and BG.
- Maltose and sucrose were key metabolites differentiating the clusters; maltose was not detected in WG, and sucrose was absent in BG.
- Orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) further confirmed the differentiation of the ginseng products.
- UPLC-QTOF/MS with an in-house library profiled ginsenosides, identifying 26, 28, 34, and 36 ginsenosides in WG, TG, RG, and BG, respectively.

- Sabine Metzger, University of Cologne, Germany

**Co-Authors:**
- Niklas Kleinenkuhnen, Felix Büchel, Silke C. Gerlich, Stanislav Kopriva

**Abstract:**
Sulfur is present in plants in essential primary metabolites and secondary metabolites. This study developed an LC-MS method to identify and quantify sulfated flavonoids, a group of sulfated secondary metabolites prominent in the genus *Flaveria*.

**Methods:**
- A linear gradient of methanol/formic acid in water on a Restek Raptor C18 Core-Shell column was used for separation.
- Sulfated flavonoids were detected by MS in negative mode, using a neutral loss of 80 Da after collision-induced dissociation.

**Results:**
- All (mono)sulfated flavonoids described in *Flaveria* plus new ones, such as isorhamnetin-sulfate-glycoside, were detected.
- Sulfated flavonoids represent a substantial sulfur pool in *Flaveria*, larger than thiols glutathione and cysteine.
- The concentration of sulfated flavonoids in leaves is reduced by sulfur starvation.
- The new LC-MS method enables qualitative and quantitative detection of these secondary metabolites, facilitating further research on their functions.

**Presenting Author:**
- Huina Zhou, Zhengzhou Tabacco Research Institute of CNTC, China

**Co-Authors:**
- Qiansi Chen, Pingping Liu, Qingxia Zheng, Niu Zhai, Huina Zhou

**Abstract:**
This study aimed to investigate the effects of vacuum freeze-drying on the metabolome of tobacco leaves. Fresh-frozen samples in liquid nitrogen were divided into three aliquots: one kept frozen, and two freeze-dried under controlled or uncontrolled shelf surface temperature (FD1 and FD2, respectively).

**Methods:**
- Three kinds of samples were balanced in equal dry weight and analyzed by GC-MS and LC-Q-TOF with six replicates.
- A total of 79 and 99 metabolites were identified by GC-MS and LC-Q-TOF, respectively.

**Results:**
- PCA score plots showed that freeze-dried samples (FD1 and FD2) differed from fresh-frozen samples at the metabolomics level.
- LC-Q-TOF analysis revealed a clear difference due to controlled shelf surface temperature.
- VIP list and T-test analyses indicated that different metabolites identified by GC-MS usually decreased upon freeze-drying, while those identified by LC-Q-TOF mostly increased.
- Sugars, organic acids, and amino acids typically down-regulated, while terpenoids and polyphenol/flavonoids up-regulated by freeze-drying.
- Freeze-drying with controlled shelf surface temperature might slow down the metabolic flux, as the total levels of different metabolites in FD1 were closer to fresh samples than FD2.
