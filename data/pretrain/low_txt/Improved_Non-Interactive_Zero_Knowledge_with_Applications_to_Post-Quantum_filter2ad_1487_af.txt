### Improved Text

**Comparison with Existing Schemes**

Libert et al. do not provide an implementation of their scheme. In contrast, our scheme has the advantage of not requiring trusted public parameters. 

Recent work by Ling et al. [37] presents a group signature scheme based on lattices, where the signature size is independent of the number of users in the group. However, they do not investigate the concrete efficiency of their scheme. It appears that our scheme will outperform theirs in practical settings.

Some concurrent works [21, 12] have proposed constructions of ring and group signature schemes using ideas similar to ours, but employing ZKB++ as the underlying NIZKPoK. As shown in Table 4, by using our NIZKPoK instead of ZKB++, we are able to generate signatures that are approximately 3.5–4.4× shorter. Since these works do not provide implementations, we are unable to determine the running times for their schemes.

### Conclusion

In this work, we present a new construction of a "post-quantum" NIZKPoK with shorter proof sizes compared to previous work. We also explore the applications of our work in various signature schemes. Further exploration of other applications, such as in smart contracts and verification of arithmetic circuits, remains an interesting direction for future research.
