I recently upgraded to version 0.18 and I'm pleased to see that it now supports searching through all applications. However, I encountered an issue when trying to open Windows Terminal by typing "wt" into the search bar. The application does not appear in the search results, even though the built-in Windows 10 search function can find it using the same alias. It would be great if PowerToys could add support for aliases as well.
