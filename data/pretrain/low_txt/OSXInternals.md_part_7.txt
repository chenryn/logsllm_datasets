**New Features in Mac OS X:**
- **QuickTime Player:** A new version of the QuickTime player.
- **Music Player:** An application for playing MP3s and audio CDs.
- **Sherlock:** A new version of the Sherlock Internet-searching tool.
- **Internet Explorer:** A beta version of Microsoft Internet Explorer.

**Darwin and Open Source Integration:**
Apple leveraged a significant amount of existing open-source software for Mac OS X, often integrating it with the operating system. In April 2002, Apple and the Internet Systems Consortium, Inc. (ISC) jointly founded the OpenDarwin project to foster cooperative open-source development of Darwin. GNU-Darwin is an open-source, Darwin-based operating system.

**The New Kernel:**
- **xnu Kernel:** The kernel of Darwin, called xnu, is unofficially an acronym for "X is Not Unix." It is also a nod to the fact that it is the NuKernel for Mac OS X.
- **Basis:** xnu is largely based on Mach and FreeBSD but includes code and concepts from various sources such as the formerly Apple-supported MkLinux project, work done on Mach at the University of Utah, NetBSD, and OpenBSD.

### 1.5.4. Mac OS X 10.x
The first version of Mac OS X, 10.0 Cheetah, was released on March 24, 2001. Soon after, the versioning scheme for the server product was revised to synchronize with the desktop system. Since then, the trend has been to release a new version of the desktop system first, followed by the equivalent server revision.
