### Linked USDL (Unified Service Description Language)

Linked USDL is a master schema constructed using semantic web technologies and linked data principles. It is used to describe typical services in healthcare, education, and cloud computing environments.

### Ontology

An ontology is a description of concepts and relationships that can be used by people or software agents to share information within a specific domain.

### OWL (Web Ontology Language)

OWL is a markup language for publishing and sharing data using ontologies on the Internet. It is a vocabulary extension of RDF and is derived from the DAML+OIL Web Ontology Language.

### RDF (Resource Description Framework)

RDF is a family of W3C specifications originally designed as a metadata model using XML. It has evolved into a general method for modeling knowledge, supporting various syntax formats.

### RDFS (RDF Schema)

RDFS is an extensible knowledge representation language that provides basic elements for defining ontologies, also known as RDF vocabularies, intended to structure RDF resources.

### Definitions

- **Semantic Web:** The Semantic Web provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across applications, enterprises, and community boundaries. It is a collaborative effort led by W3C with the participation of numerous researchers and industrial partners.
- **XML (Extensible Markup Language):** XML is a simple, flexible text format derived from SGML (ISO 8879). It is a standard for data interchange on the Web, allowing for the structuring of data but without inherent meaning.

This revised version aims to provide a clear, coherent, and professional presentation of the provided information.
