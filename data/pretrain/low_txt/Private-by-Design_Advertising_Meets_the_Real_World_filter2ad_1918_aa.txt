## Abstract
Several designs for online advertising systems aim to enable behavioral targeting without revealing user online behavior or interest profiles to the ad network. However, these designs often overlook the role of ad auctions, which are central to the operation of modern online advertising systems. Additionally, none of these proposed designs have been implemented in real-world settings. This thesis addresses these gaps.

First, we tackle the challenge of conducting ad auctions that leverage user profiles while maintaining the privacy of profile information. We define the problem, explore potential solutions, and discuss their pros and cons. Our analysis, based on data from Microsoft Bing advertising auctions, indicates that, although no solution is ideal in all respects, they are practical and effective.

Second, we develop and evaluate a fully functional prototype of a privacy-preserving ad system at a significant scale. Over two months, our system served more than 13,000 opted-in users, with an average of 4,800 active users daily. During the last month, we recorded 790,000 ad views, 417 clicks, and a small number of product purchases. The click-through rates were comparable to those of Google display ads. Our prototype also includes a differentially private analytics mechanism, which we used to gather experimental data.

In this thesis, we share our firsthand experience and lessons learned from running the world's first fully operational "private-by-design" behavioral advertising and analytics system.

## Acknowledgements
While the journey itself is the destination, a thesis is certainly a milestone along the way. I am grateful to everyone who supported me and shared this part of my journey—it was a fun ride!

I am especially thankful to my advisor, Paul Francis, for his guidance, for including me in the Privad project, and for supporting me during my time at Google, even when the U.S. government was considering whether I posed a national security threat.

I also thank Saikat Guha for his invaluable help and for setting the path I followed. Saikat embodies the qualities of a researcher I aspire to: inquisitiveness, commitment, and keenness. I hope some of these qualities have rubbed off on me.

My gratitude extends to my Google hosts, Damon Kohler, Mauricio Zuluaga, and Manpreet Sight, with whom I worked on exciting projects and learned a great deal about software and systems engineering.

I thank my friends and collaborators, Bin Cheng and Ruichuan Chen, whose joint work appears in this thesis. Istemi Ekin Akkus has been a great lab mate, providing a sounding board for ideas and sharing enjoyable moments.

I am also grateful to the students, faculty, and staff at MPI-SWS for creating a supportive learning environment. Special thanks to Tobias Kaufmann and Christian Klein for IT support, and to Susanne Girard, Vera Laubscher, Corinna Kopke, and Maria-Louise Albrecht for organizational assistance and navigating the German bureaucratic system. Rose Hoberman provided invaluable help with writing and soft-skills seminars.

I am deeply grateful to my family—Mam, Babushka, Ded, Igor, Nastya, and Senya—for their unwavering support. My almost-family, physics teacher Nina Semenovna, inspired me to appreciate science.

Finally, I am profoundly grateful to Yulia for her endless support and encouragement, for pushing me to stay the course, and for enduring my occasional grumbling and fits of nihilism. Without you, I would not be able to enjoy my life or have one outside the lab.
