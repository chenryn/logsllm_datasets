**ATT&CK ID:** T1218.014  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** MMC

Adversaries may exploit `mmc.exe` to execute malicious `.msc` files. Microsoft Management Console (MMC) is a legitimate, often Microsoft-signed, binary that can be utilized in both graphical and command-line environments. MMC enables the creation, opening, and saving of custom administrative consoles, which are composed of snap-insâ€”administrative tools provided by Microsoft. These snap-ins can be used for local or remote management of Windows systems. Additionally, MMC can open pre-defined `.msc` files, which are used to configure system settings.

### Key Points:
- **Purpose of MMC:** 
  - Create, open, and save custom administrative consoles.
  - Manage Windows systems locally or remotely using snap-ins.
  - Open and use Microsoft-created `.msc` files for system configuration.
- **Threat Vector:**
  - Adversaries may abuse `mmc.exe` to execute malicious `.msc` files, leveraging the trusted nature of the MMC binary to evade detection.

This technique highlights the importance of monitoring and controlling the use of `mmc.exe` and associated `.msc` files to prevent potential misuse by adversaries.
