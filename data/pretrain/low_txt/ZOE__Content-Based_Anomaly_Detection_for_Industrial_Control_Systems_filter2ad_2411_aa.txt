## Abstract
Industrial control systems (ICS) are inherently challenging for intrusion detection due to their complexity and the use of proprietary components. The lack of public specifications for binary protocols has led the research community to focus on more abstract detection methods. In this paper, we demonstrate that the content of unknown binary protocols can be effectively modeled. ZOE, our proposed framework, derives prototype models specific to individual message types, capturing the characteristics of arbitrary binary protocols and enabling the detection of various forms of attacks as anomalies. We evaluated ZOE using six days of network traffic from a large power plant (1,900 MW) with over 92,000 unique devices. Our results show that ZOE significantly outperforms related approaches in detection performance and reduces false positives by up to an order of magnitude.

## I. Introduction
The protection of critical infrastructures is paramount for societal security. Industrial facilities, such as power stations and water supply systems, are high-value targets for terrorists and nation-state attackers. The increasing automation and interconnection of industrial processes have expanded the attack surface, presenting new challenges for security solutions. For instance, a power plant may consist of numerous proprietary software and hardware components, each using non-standardized protocols. This makes it difficult for operators to understand the implementation details of their systems, rendering traditional intrusion detection approaches ineffective. Consequently, ICS networks have become increasingly targeted by attacks in recent years [e.g., 7, 15, 33, 47].

Without protocol specifications, an in-depth analysis of communication content is challenging. The research community has thus shifted towards modeling the appearance of network traffic rather than its content [28, 42, 52, 60] or even the underlying physical process [24, 29, 61]. While this approach can detect specific classes of attacks, it also limits the scope of defense. For example, Stuxnet sabotaged production processes by making subtle, infrequent changes to motor speeds, which were anomalous in the context of normal bus communication [15]. A precise model of normality can detect such anomalies at both the process and network levels.

However, constructing these models is inherently difficult. Industrial facilities undergo frequent changes in hardware and process adaptations. Using expert models for detection requires manual updates, which can create vulnerabilities if not maintained. Alternatively, machine learning can automatically learn and update models, but the prevalence of proprietary binary protocols complicates content-based approaches [23].

In this paper, we present ZOE, a framework that effectively and efficiently applies content-based anomaly detection to proprietary binary protocols. We introduce prototype models, which are prototypical representations specific to individual message types. These models characterize both the structure and typical data of message types. We also present a linear-time algorithm based on Count-Min Sketches [9] for learning and applying these models, bridging the gap between clustering and anomaly detection.

For evaluation, we recorded approximately 210 GiB of network traffic from two industrial facilities: a large power plant (1,900 MW) and a coal mining facility. Over six days, we gathered data from 92,700 unique devices. Since recordings of attacks in industrial environments are rare, we developed a tool to generate abnormal network messages for calibration. Our empirical evaluation shows that ZOE improves detection performance by up to an order of magnitude and significantly reduces false positives.

**Contributions:**
- **Prototype Models for Network Messages:** We introduce prototype models and a linear-time algorithm for constructing them. These models capture the structure and typical data of individual message types.
- **Noise-Resilient Anomaly Detection:** We demonstrate how protocol models can prune out irrelevant, noisy features, enhancing the expressiveness of the models and enabling robust anomaly detection in high-entropy data environments.
- **Large-Scale Evaluation Using Authentic SCADA Data:** We conduct a large-scale evaluation with authentic data from two different industrial facilities, including PROFINET IO traffic and five undocumented protocols, involving over 210 GiB of data and 92,700 unique devices.

## II. Problem Statement and Scope
Protecting industrial computer networks, such as ICS and SCADA systems, from attacks is a formidable task. While these networks are more homogeneous than general-purpose networks, they often employ proprietary systems and protocols. Operators typically lack access to detailed protocol specifications, making conventional security techniques like intrusion detection systems less effective. Industrial networks frequently use binary protocols to minimize communication overhead and delay, further complicating the analysis of network traffic.

To address this, we model communication as a sequence of incoming and outgoing binary messages, or application-level data units (ADUs). For stateful transport protocols like TCP, ADUs can be extracted using stream reassembly; for stateless protocols like UDP, ADUs refer to the application-level payloads. We focus on analyzing binary messages and identifying anomalous content.

Industrial environments have a narrow and well-defined scope, making them suitable for anomaly detection. However, several challenges must be addressed:
- **High Costs of Error:** False negatives can cause significant harm, while false positives can render the system useless. An effective detector must minimize both.
- **Lack of Training Data:** Sufficient training data is crucial for building accurate models. Gathering enough data, especially malicious samples, is a major challenge.
- **Semantic Gap:** Anomaly detection reports deviations from normal content, requiring periodic retraining to maintain accuracy.
- **Large Variability of Input Data:** Network traffic exhibits great variability, necessitating careful aggregation of information over extended periods.

## III. Attack Detection in Proprietary Protocols
Research on content-based intrusion detection has shown that considering the presence of features in network traffic is often superior to counting their occurrences [23, 63, 68, 71]. However, frequency information is valuable for modeling normality, especially in proprietary environments.

We develop ZOE, a content-based anomaly detector capable of handling both binary and text-based protocols without requiring protocol specifications. ZOE learns a model of normality from observed network traffic and detects attacks as deviations. The key components of ZOE are:
- **Building Prototype Models:** We partition network traffic into groups of messages with similar content, approximating protocol states and deriving one prototype model per message type.
- **Reducing Noise:** We filter out rare features using a frequency threshold to reduce noise and improve model accuracy.

These components form the basis of our detector, enabling robust and efficient anomaly detection in industrial control systems.
