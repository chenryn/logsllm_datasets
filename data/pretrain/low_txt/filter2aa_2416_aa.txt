## What is NAC?

### Introduction to NAC
- **Problem Definition:**
  - An enterprise network is a complex and dynamic environment that hosts a variety of devices such as workstations, servers, printers, wireless access points, VoIP phones, switches, and routers.
  - The stability, integrity, and regular operation of the enterprise LAN are threatened by rogue, non-compliant, and unmanaged elements (e.g., viruses, worms, malware, information theft).

- **NAC History:**
  - NAC has evolved over time, but standardization and common criteria for NAC do not exist. Definitions and components vary from one vendor to another.

- **Basic Tasks of NAC:**
  - Control network access.
  - Ensure compliance.
  - NAC is primarily a security solution and secondarily a compliance solution.
  - NAC is a risk mitigation security solution.

- **My Definition of NAC:**
  - Network Access Control (NAC) is a set of technologies and defined processes tasked with controlling access to the Enterprise LAN, allowing only authorized and compliant devices to access and operate on the network.

## NAC Basics

### Attack Vectors
- **Architecture:**
  - The inner workings of the different solution pieces.
- **Technology:**
  - Technologies used to support various NAC features:
    - Element detection
    - Device authorization
    - User authentication
    - Assessment
    - Quarantine/Enforcement
- **Components:**
  - Various components that make up a NAC solution.

## 10 (or More) Ways to Bypass NAC

### Ways to Bypass NAC
- **Definition:**
  - **Element Detection:**
    - Completeness
    - Real-time
    - L2 vs. L3
  - **Validation:**
    - Device authorization
    - User authentication
  - **Quarantine:**
    - Shared vs. Private
    - L2 vs. L3
    - How to bypass
  - **Enforcement:**
    - Using exceptions as a bypass means
    - L2 vs. L3
  - **Assessment:**
    - Qualification of elements
    - Client vs. client-less
    - All-in-one client approach
    - Information checked during the assessment stage
    - Falsifying returning information

### The Definition
- **Problem Definition:**
  - How one defines their NAC solution.
  - The goal of the NAC solution:
    - Posture validation only
    - Access control against all devices
- **NAC Solution Definition:**
  - Security
  - Compliance
- **Trusted Network Connect (TNC):**
  - TNC is an open, non-proprietary standard that enables the application and enforcement of security requirements for endpoints connecting to the corporate network. It enforces corporate configuration requirements and prevents and detects malware outbreaks.
  - TNC includes collecting endpoint configuration data, comparing this data against policies set by the network owner, and providing an appropriate level of network access based on the detected level of policy compliance.

### Element Detection
- **Core Feature:**
  - One cannot afford to have an element operating on the network without knowing about it.
  - If a NAC solution cannot perform complete element detection in real-time, it does not provide a valuable line of defense.
  - No Knowledge == No Control == No Defense
  - No Element Detection == No NAC

- **Methods of Element Detection:**
  - Listening to traffic:
    - DHCP
    - Broadcast listeners
    - Out-of-band solutions
    - In-line devices
  - Integration with a switch:
    - 802.1x
    - SNMP traps
  - Software:
    - Client-based software

- **Passive Element Detection:**
  - What you see is only what you get.
  - No control over the pace of discovery.
  - More information: "Risks of passive network discovery systems," Ofir Arkin, 2005. Available from: [Sys-Security Blog](http://sys-security.com/blog/published-materials/papers/)

- **Issues with Element Detection:**
  - Layer-3:
    - Not real-time
    - Not complete
  - Layer-2:
    - An element may reside on the local subnet and not be detected.
  - Other issues:
    - DHCP: Elements that do not use DHCP will not be discovered.
    - SNMP Traps: Elements connecting to switches that cannot send SNMP traps will not be discovered.
    - Client Software: Elements that cannot install the client-based software will not be discovered.
  - NAT and Virtualization:
    - NAT-enabled devices and virtualization (e.g., VMware, Xen, Parallels) pose significant challenges.

### Validation
- **Process:**
  - Authorization of devices to operate on the Enterprise LAN and proving the identity of users.
- **Device Authorization:**
  - Combats rogue devices.
  - Must be tightly integrated with element detection.
  - Unauthorized devices must be immediately blocked when attached to the network.
- **User Authentication:**
  - Some NAC solutions only mandate user authentication.
  - Others do not require user authentication or support scenarios where it is not mandated.
  - Example: Cisco NAC Framework, two out of three operational modes do not require user authentication.
  - Consequences of using a non-authorized device with proper user credentials can be severe (e.g., stealing user credentials).

- **Example:**
  - The goal is to validate the username and password, perform device and network scans, and grant or deny access based on compliance.
  - Source: Cisco Clean Access presentation.

- **Tying Between Device and User:**
  - Creating a binding between a device, user, and location enhances authentication, authorization, and auditing.

- **Poor User Authentication Example:**
  - DHCP in a Box / Authenticated DHCP.

- **A Word About 802.1x:**
  - Just a username/password protocol.
  - Not a device authorization solution.
  - Credentials are often the same as those used for domain/machine logon.

### Assessment
- **Process:**
  - Evaluating whether an element meets the required security posture.
  - Ensuring that devices and users comply with the organization's security policies.

This document provides a comprehensive overview of NAC, its components, and potential bypass methods, offering insights into the importance of robust NAC solutions in enterprise environments.
