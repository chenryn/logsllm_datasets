## OpticSpy Overview
- **Optical Receiver**: Converts light into voltage
- **Wavelength Range**: Visible and near-infrared (420-940nm)
- **Signal Speed**: 100Hz to 1.5MHz
- **Data Stream Polarity**: Selectable (normal or inverted)
- **Adjustments**: Gain and threshold via potentiometers
- **Interface**: USB for direct connection to a host PC

## Covert Channels
- **Definition**: Hidden methods for intentionally exfiltrating or transferring data from a normally functioning system
- **Implementation**:
  - Hardware (HW) and/or firmware (FW) modifications
  - Specifications altered or misdesigned before manufacturing
  - Modifications during manufacturing or in the field
  - Hardware implant via interdiction

## Exploiting the Environment
- **Leakage Methods**: Optical, acoustic, thermal, or RF characteristics
- **Notable Research**:
  - **Soft Tempest**: Hidden Data Transmission Using Electromagnetic Emanations (Kuhn, Anderson)
  - **Emanate Like a Boss**: Generalized Covert Data Exfiltration with Funtenna (Cui)
  - **Inaudible Sound as a Covert Channel in Mobile Devices** (Deshotels)
  - **BitWhisper**: Covert Signaling Channel between Air-Gapped Computers using Thermal Manipulations (Guri et al.)

## Blinkenlights
- **LEDs for Data Exfiltration**: Modulation faster than human eye detection
- **Optical Covert Channels**:
  - Information Leakage from Optical Emanations (Loughry and Umphress, 2002)
  - Silence on the Wire: A Field Guide to Passive Reconnaissance and Indirect Attacks (Zalewski)
  - Extended Functionality Attacks on IoT Devices: The Case of Smart Lights (Ronen, Shamir)
  - xLED: Covert Data Exfiltration from Air-Gapped Networks via Router LEDs (Guri et al.)

  - **Size, Date, Title, Filename**
  - **Components**:
    - **Photodiode**: Vishay Semiconductor BPW21R
      - Converts light into current
      - Photoconductive mode (reverse bias)
      - Faster response for higher bandwidth
      - Less sensitivity, increased dark current
      - Bias resistor affects response/sensitivity
    - **Amplification**:
      - **Maxim MAX4124**: Wide Bandwidth, Low Power, Rail-to-Rail Operational Amplifier
      - Two stages with signal massaging in between
      - Lower gain per stage for less overall noise
      - Total transimpedance gain = R2 x U1Av x U2Av
    - **Threshold Detector** and **Non-Inverting Amplifiers**
    - **USB Mini B Connector**
    - **FT231XS USB to Serial Converter**
    - **Power Management**: MIC5205-3.3YM5
