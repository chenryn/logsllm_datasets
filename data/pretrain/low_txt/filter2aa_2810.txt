**John E. Benson, J.D.**
**Bridging the Gap Between Technology and the Law**

**Introduction: Technology vs. The Law**
- **Technology:**
  - Becomes more advanced
  - Changes daily
  - Thrives on growth and development
- **The Law:**
  - Rare sweeping changes
  - Slow to react
  - Resistant to new and different concepts
  - Through the Common Law system, laws are:
    - Stable
    - Predictable
    - Methodical

**Why Can’t the Law Be Different?**
- Unpredictable viewpoint
- Cases have yet to reach appellate levels
- Cases haven’t been brought at all

**Cause and Effect: Adoption and Perception of Technology**
- Most attorneys lack a deep understanding of technology
- Judges are even less knowledgeable
- Attorneys come from diverse backgrounds

**Who Are We Talking About?**
- **Recent Graduates:**
  - Most use laptops
  - Most use Windows XP
  - Most use Internet Explorer
  - Many do not pay attention to sending passwords in plain text

- **Practicing Attorneys:**
  - Love email and Blackberries
  - All Federal Courts have electronic filing
  - Strong obligation to keep communications confidential

**Encryption:**
- Easy to use
- Easy to implement
- Especially beneficial for small practices

**Understanding:**
- Operate on the front lines
- Require excellent advocacy skills
- Working understanding of facts

**Trial Attorneys:**
- **The Amero Trial:**
  - Substitute teacher
  - Risk of injury to a minor
  - Exposure to pornography

- **The Statute:**
  - Willfully or unlawfully causes
  - A child under 16
  - To be placed in a situation where the morals of that child are likely to be impaired
  - Shall be punished

- **Elements:**
  - Willful means deliberately or intentionally
  - Not a standard of negligence
  - If she was negligent, she would not be convicted

**Prosecution Highlights:**
- “Were there any other images that had been placed on your hard drive on the day before that you saw at least in the file format?”
- "Did she log onto any programs?"
- “Specifically to what I am pointing at here, my understanding is this http://www.vaginalcumshots.com, specifically this website, again, was accessed to that PC in Mr. Napp’s classroom, correct?”

**Defense Highlights:**
- “Were any of the adware, spyware, parasites, and viruses updated on or before October 19th?”
- “I’m computer illiterate.”

**Evidentiary Pitfalls:**
- Before checking firewall logs, the computer was accessed by IT
- Computer not taken out of service for a week

- **Police Investigator:**
  - Q: "Did you examine the hard drive for spyware, viruses, or parasites?"
  - A: No

- **District Failings:**
  - District still runs Windows 95 and 98
  - Only antivirus protection
  - Filtering software wasn’t updated

- **Q: “Does spyware and adware generate pornography?”**
  - A: “I'm not aware that they do”

**Why Was Some Evidence Excluded?**
- Procedure not to be taken lightly
- Prosecution not given the material prepared by the defense expert

**Did It Make a Difference?**
- Probably not
- Expert gave his conclusions
- Mentioned adware and spyware numerous times in testimony

**Actions of the Expert:**
- Rude to the court
- Clearly angering the judge and prosecutor

**Who Do We Blame?**
- Everyone
- District
- The State
- The Defense Attorney
- The Expert

**Was the Response Warranted?**
- Misdirected
- Blind rage against the judicial system is ineffective
- Work together
- Ensure this doesn’t happen again

**Where is the Case Now?**
- Judge has ordered a new trial
- Anticipating more expert testimony to be offered (and admitted)
- What will the new outcome be?

**AACS v. The World:**
- HD-DVD Processing Key cracked weeks ago
- Finally appears on Digg
- Takedown notices sent
- Hilarity ensues

**Cold Facts:**
- Dissemination is a violation of the DMCA
- Takedown requests were valid
- Not a First Amendment issue
- Private companies may do as they choose

**The Reality:**
- Landscape significantly different than when DeCSS was released
- Copyright holders must find more effective ways of rights protection
- User-driven sites must be ready to respond

**Torrentspy:**
- Hosts torrent files
- Doesn’t keep logs

**Conclusion:**
- The fundamental issues separating law and technology aren’t going away
- Attorneys need to have a better relationship with technology
- Need for stronger advocates to prevent poor judicial decisions
