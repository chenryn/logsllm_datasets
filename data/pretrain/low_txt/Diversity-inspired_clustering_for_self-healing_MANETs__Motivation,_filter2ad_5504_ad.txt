The proposed protocol achieves over 90% improvement in coverage compared to the baseline protocol (i.e., \( P_{\text{bl}}^{\text{hm}}(v) \)). However, neither protocol can achieve practically meaningful coverage with a small transmission range \( r \). This is because many scattered nodes would be out of the transmission range of any other nodes, making it impossible for clustering mechanisms to organize them effectively.

When \( r \) increases, meaning that node \( v \) is likely to have more neighbors, the SCP (Superimposed Clustering Protocol) begins to perform satisfactorily. At \( r = 40 \), the coverage exceeds 90%, while the baseline protocol's coverage remains below 70%. However, both protocols experience a slight decrease in coverage beyond this point. The reason is that while a larger transmission range allows a cluster to accommodate more nodes, the number of competitors for \( v \) in its neighborhood also increases. This makes it more difficult for the ID of \( v \) to be ranked as the maximum or minimum, thereby slightly decreasing the likelihood that \( v \) will become a Cluster Head (CH). Despite this, the coverage value remains fairly stable for larger values of \( r \). By examining the constituent measures, specifically \( P_{\text{scp}}^{\text{m}}(v) \), we observe that these values slowly decrease and increase, respectively, as \( r \) continues to increase, indicating that \( P_{\text{scp}}^{\text{hm}}(v) \) reaches an approximately equilibrium state.

In Figure 4(b), the results are based on a scenario where a 500×500 field accommodates 400 nodes. For such a dense node population, both SCP and the baseline protocol reach their peak performance earlier, at \( r = 30 \). Beyond this point, SCP's coverage remains high and stable throughout the considered transmission range.

Figures 5(a) and 5(b) demonstrate the dual-policy-induced clusterhead redundancy and node coverage redundancy, respectively. These redundancies, though a by-product of superimposed clustering, offer robustness advantages over single-policy-based approaches. Figures 5(a) and 5(b) display the values of \( P_{\text{scp}}^{r|\text{ch}}(v) \) and \( P_{\text{scp}}^{r|\text{cm}}(v) \), respectively.

Both figures show that the likelihoods of redundancy are low when \( r \) is below 20, especially in scenarios with low node population density. As \( r \) increases, the probability of the presence of a redundant CH and the probability of redundant coverage also increase. This is because a larger cluster will accommodate more nodes, increasing the likelihood of redundancies. These results are desirable, as the loss of coverage in a larger node population would have more severe consequences compared to a small cluster containing a few nodes. Nonetheless, the probabilities of CH redundancy and coverage redundancy quickly reach an approximately equilibrium state, suggesting that further increases in \( r \) will yield limited benefits.

Table 2 presents the results obtained from the SAN model illustrated in Figure 3. For the evaluation, we assume that the time between the moves of the passive CH is exponentially distributed with a rate of 0.1 (per second). When the timed activity "mv p" is activated, the passive CH will move in either the positive or negative direction along the X and/or Y axis within a cluster of radius 30 meters (i.e., the transmission range \( r \)). The threshold for activating/deactivating statistical preferences varies from 4 to 20 meters. Specifically, when \( D \) exceeds threshold \( h \), the passive CH \( v \) has a 70% chance to move toward and a 30% chance to move away from the cluster center.

Each entry in Table 2 represents the probability that the distance between the passive CH and the cluster center will be at most \( d \), and the translated probability that the gracefully degraded clustering coverage \( G \) provided by the passive CH will be at least \( g \). The results reveal an interesting tradeoff between \( h \) and \( G \). Even with a very relaxed threshold (\( h = 20 \)), the probability that the passive CH will cover nearly 60% (or above) of the cluster area remains over 99%.

### Related Work

In recent years, numerous research efforts have been devoted to clustering protocols, which can be classified into two major categories based on their clustering policies. The first category includes protocols that explicitly address specific requirements, such as mobility-aware clustering, energy-efficient clustering, and combined-metrics-based clustering. The effectiveness of these protocols depends on the accuracy of parameters, the validity of assumptions, and the available amount of system profile data. For example, the MOBIC protocol [13] groups mobile hosts with similar speeds into the same cluster to reduce the need for cluster maintenance, making its performance highly dependent on the assumption of group mobility.

The second category includes protocols that implicitly address requirements. For instance, the Passive Clustering (PC) protocol [14] invokes cluster formation and maintenance only when mobile hosts have data to disseminate, allowing control messages to piggyback on upper-layer traffic. This reduces clustering overhead and maintenance costs for MANETs with high mobility. However, PC may struggle with bursty traffic, as the readiness of a cluster-based routing structure can be problematic.

The concept of dual-homing, widely used in the Internet, has been adapted to improve the survivability of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In [15], dual-homing is realized through the composition of two paths consisting of both disjointed and jointed links, fostering partially protected multicast to ensure scalability. While SCP shares a similar philosophy, it complements the notion of partial protection by enabling self-healing in cluster-based MANETs through graceful performance degradation.

Several dominant pruning algorithms have been developed to reduce broadcast redundancy in ad hoc wireless networks. For example, Lou and Wu [16] developed approximation algorithms to efficiently reduce the size of the dominating set. While the purpose of these algorithms is to decrease the number of nodes on data forwarding paths, the objective of redundancy shadowing in SCP is to extract and combine the complementary portions of two cluster layers and preserve redundancies for future self-healing needs. Finally, our superimposed clustering framework is flexible enough to permit clustering policies to address specific requirements either explicitly or implicitly.

### Concluding Remarks

We have developed a framework for superimposed clustering and investigated an instance of SCP. This effort is significant for several reasons. First, since self-healing is typically realized through autonomous reconfiguration, superimposed clustering provides a low-cost approach for self-healing in large-scale systems, allowing performance to be gracefully degradable.

Second, we have exploited the notion of diversity in a novel way. Rather than aiming for convergence or majority agreement, our intent is to let diversified clustering policies create two cluster layers that compensate for each other after redundancy shadowing. The shadowed redundancies prepare the cluster-based system for self-healing.

While design diversity can be expensive in terms of development, maintenance, and performance costs, the judicious use of diversified policies in SCP is affordable. The MaxMin-ID-based SCP instance described in this paper requires the same neighborhood information that individual policies would need when used alone. This implies that the parallel use of clustering policies and related computation (i.e., redundancy shadowing) generally requires no additional message exchanges between hosts. Since message transmission is the primary driver of performance overhead and energy consumption in MANETs, SCP is both affordable and efficient.
