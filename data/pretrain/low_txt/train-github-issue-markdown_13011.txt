In our research group, each member has a user account on a shared server where we conduct individual experiments (running Ubuntu in the background). By default, everyone downloads `transformers` models to their home directory. With 20 researchers, this setup results in multiple duplicates of the same model, such as "bert-base-cased," which is inefficient and consumes excessive storage space.

We attempted to address this issue by creating a globally accessible (777 permissions) directory for the `TRANSFORMERS_CACHE`. However, this solution did not work as expected. When a model is downloaded, some files are created with read/write permissions exclusive to the user who initiated the download. Consequently, other users encounter permission errors when trying to access these models.

To resolve this, we propose adding an option that allows setting file permissions for all downloaded files during the model download process. Ideally, this feature would be configurable via a system-wide environment variable. This functionality could be implemented in `file_utils.py`, similar to existing options like `local_files_only`.

Currently, I do not have the time to develop this feature myself, but I am open to any feedback or suggestions.
