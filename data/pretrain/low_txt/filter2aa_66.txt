# Frontpage: Laying the Groundwork

## What is Frontpage?

- **Definition**: Frontpage is Microsoft's integrated web site development tool.
- **Functionality**: It enables users with little to no web page experience to add basic to advanced functionality to their websites.
- **Integration**: It is part of the MS Office package.
- **Security Concerns**: It has been known to present significant security vulnerabilities.

## Who is Vermeer Technologies?

- **History**: In early 1995, Vermeer Technologies developed one of the first web publishing tools for simple end-users, named Frontpage.
- **Acquisition**: Following its success, Microsoft acquired the application and integrated it into the Office package.

## Decoding the System

### Protocol Analysis

#### Client/Server Protocol Analysis
- **Communication**: The Frontpage client and server extensions communicate over HTTP PUT requests. The client interacts with `Author.dll`, `Admin.dll`, and `shtml.exe`.
- **Author.dll (exe)**: Handles authoring commands, content uploading, downloading, property review, and adding enhancements.
- **Admin.dll (exe)**: Manages administrative commands, such as adding users, modifying permissions, and listing accounts.
- **Shtml.exe, vti_rpc**: Facilitates initial access and service negotiation.

### The Authentication System
- **Process**: Authentication occurs with each request, including login, upload, download, permission changes, and folder navigation.
- **Resource Usage**: While resource-intensive, this method limits state-based attacks.

### _vti_inf.html

- **Configuration Information**: This file provides configuration details and helps in determining the server environment.
- **Operating System Determination**:
  - Files with references to `.exe` tools are likely on Unix servers.
  - Files with references to `.dll` tools are likely on Windows servers.
  - Server extension version numbers can help identify the OS version.

### Version Table
- **Windows 98/ME Personal Webserver**: Version unknown.
- **Windows NT 4.0**: Version 4.x.
- **Windows 2000**: Version 5.x.
- **Windows XP**: Version 5.x.

### Understanding Vermeer RPC Packets
- **Format**: Responses from Frontpage Server Extensions come in the form of Vermeer RPC packets, which resemble HTML pages.
- **Information Encoding**: Data is encoded within these packets based on position within HTML tags, similar to early XML.
- **Sample Packet**: Contains information such as physical drive locations, useful for Unicode exploits.

## Knocking on the Door

### Custom Tools
- **fpxploiter**: A Perl-Gtk scanning tool that identifies vulnerable Frontpage-accessible webservers.
- **Features**:
  - Locating webservers with default or user-defined accounts and passwords.
  - Identifying servers without passwords or with weak passwords.

### Using fpxploiter
- **Starting the Tool**: Run `fpxploiter` to open the main window.
- **Scanning Targets**:
  - Set targets via `File -> Set Targets` or `Ctrl-T`.
  - Enter host targets.
- **Password List**:
  - Modify the password list via `File -> Set Password List`.
- **User Account**:
  - Change the default user account via `File -> Set User Account`.
- **Export Results**:
  - Save the log file via `File -> Save Log`.

### Future Directions
- **Apache Support**: Adding support for Apache Frontpage extensions.
- **Tool Redesign**: Rebuilding fpxploiter as a generic Frontpage access library.
- **Rebuild Options**: Rebuild in C/Gtk or C++/QT.
- **Content Upload**: Enabling content upload features.

### Code Availability
- **fpxploiter**: Available at [http://www.fpxploiter.org](http://www.fpxploiter.org) and on the DEFCON CD.

## What to Do When You're There

### ASP for Hackers
- **SQL Server Database Hunting**:
  - **Tools**: SQL Server database access tools.
  - **Custom ASP Pages**: Execute queries and explore SQL Servers.
  - **fpxploiter**: Locate vulnerable servers.
  - **ASP Pages**: Tie everything together to execute SQL queries against the database.

### Summary
- **Fpxploiter**: Helps find vulnerable web servers.
- **SQLUltimate.asp**: A custom ASP code that functions as a SQL Analyzer.
- **Actions**:
  - Add SQL Server users (if in the System Admin role).
  - Access corporate data.
  - Execute extended stored procedures.
  - Locate application accounts and passwords.

### Command Line ASP
- **cmdasp.asp**: Executes console commands and returns results.
- **Commands**:
  - `netstat -a`
  - `ipconfig -all`
  - `ver`
  - `set`
  - `net users`
  - `net localgroup`

### Summary
- **Fpxploiter**: Finds vulnerable web servers.
- **cmdasp.asp**: Executes simple console commands.
- **Ideas**:
  - Use `netstat -an` and `netstat -a` for reverse DNS.
  - Use `net localgroup` and `net view` to understand drive mappings and groups.
  - Use `ping` to find additional servers.

### Future Ideas
- **ASP Code**:
  - Used with the winsock control for "scanning" from the webserver.
  - View SMB shares and remote administration.
  - Navigate internal web sites (Intranets) using `xmlhttp` controls.

## Holding Down the Fort

### Securing Frontpage
- **Strong Passwords**:
  - Use upper and lowercase characters, numbers, and special characters.
  - Choose passwords over eight characters long.
- **Change Admin Account**:
  - Avoid common names like `Root`, `Admin`, `123`, and `Password`.
- **Least Privilege**:
  - Provide only necessary access.
  - Use Frontpage roles to assign Author rights to specific webs.
  - Reserve Admin rights for specific accounts.
- **IP Restrictions**:
  - Use IIS native IP-based restrictions to block access to `admin.dll` and `author.dll` from external IP addresses.
  - Segment developers and limit their access.
