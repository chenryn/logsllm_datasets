### 9. Conclusion

This study investigated the performance impact of transitioning to DNS over HTTPS (DoH) for residential clients globally. We employed a meticulous methodology, utilizing 22,052 clients worldwide to collect our measurements. The resulting data presents a complex picture: DoH provides performance benefits in certain regions but causes slowdowns in others. We then examined differences between four major public DoH providers, highlighting architectural and routing capabilities that may influence overall resolution performance. Additionally, we analyzed several explanatory variables correlated with the performance impact of switching from DNS over UDP (Do53) to DoH. Our findings indicate that clients in countries with higher-quality Internet infrastructure (faster speeds, more Autonomous Systems) and those from higher-income countries are less likely to experience a slowdown and may even see a speedup with DoH. This raises important questions about the asymmetric effects of global DoH adoption, which should be further studied and considered in DoH deployment decisions. We have made our dataset available for further research, and we hope our findings will inform the DoH community as adoption continues to accelerate.

### A. Ethics

Our measurement methodology involves the use of the BrightData proxy network and the RIPE Atlas measurement platform. Below, we discuss the key ethical aspects related to our experiments:

1. **BrightData**: BrightData is a commercial platform. We purchased their services and strictly adhered to their Terms of Service when running our experiments. We also had significant discussions with the BrightData team about our experiments ahead of time and received explicit approval from them to conduct our measurements on their platform.

2. **Exit Nodes**: The exit nodes of the BrightData network are recruited/enrolled by the platform. These exit nodes and the BrightData platform have agreements to route traffic through the exit nodes (in exchange for free VPN services).

3. **Experiment Design**: Our experiments only involve generating DNS queries to benign DNS resolvers to query benign domain names (under our control). This does not introduce any harm to the proxy service or the exit nodes. We do not store raw client IP addresses in our study. Any geolocation lookups presented in this work are based on the /24 of the IP address. We log the IP addresses of the public recursive resolvers used to perform DoH queries, but we take care not to inspect any potentially sensitive client data (e.g., client IPs present in the ECS-client-subnet DNS extension).

4. **RIPE Atlas**: Our use of RIPE Atlas is in line with their terms of service and involves minimal testing for ground truth validation experiments.

### B. Dataset

We provide additional figures characterizing our dataset. Figure 8 shows a map with all the MaxMind-located clients we used in this study (locating them based on their /24). Figure 9 shows these clients by resolver, coloring them based on the geographic distance to the DoH resolver point-of-presence they used.

### C. Regression Analysis

In addition to conducting aggregate regressions, we also computed linear regressions filtered by each DoH resolver provider. The results are shown in Table 6.

**Table 6: Linear Modeling of DNS Performance by Resolver**  
We show the results of our linear modeling split by each resolver for the delta between a single DoH request compared to Do53. All results are statistically significant with p < 0.001 unless indicated by an asterisk (*).
