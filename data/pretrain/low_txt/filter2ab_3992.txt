**Title: BlackHat Asia 2021 - Hey, You, Get Off My Private Data: Do Apps Respect Your Privacy as They Claim?**

In recent years, numerous major companies have faced regulatory penalties and legal repercussions for violating personal data privacy. Some of these violations may stem from misunderstandings or a lack of awareness regarding data protection laws. In this presentation, we will share the results of our study on multinational data protection regulations and the compliance of a large number of apps.

Our research focuses on whether apps provide users with control over their personal data, specifically addressing the rights to be informed, to give consent, to be erased and forgotten, and to obtain data portability. We have developed a comprehensive framework to evaluate the compliance of Android apps with data protection regulations. This framework is available as an open-source, automated tool that app developers can use to assess their own applications.

We applied our framework to the top 1,000 apps in the Google Play Store and other alternative app stores. Our findings reveal that privacy violations are widespread among these apps. During the talk, we will present our key findings and offer recommendations to raise awareness among app manufacturers and other stakeholders.
