### Issue Summary
I have encountered an issue where a link on a server-rendered page (using Express) does not work as expected. The page is rendered with an alias, and clicking the link does not change the URL parameter as intended.

### Current Behavior
- When the `XX` page is rendered, there is a link to the same page but with an additional parameter.
- The link is defined as `href="/XX?id=1"`.
- Clicking the link does nothing, and no errors are logged in the console.
- The link works if I change `href="/XX?id=1"` to `href="_random_string_"`.
- The link also works correctly when I dynamically change the subpage to `_ZZ_` and then return to `_XX_`.

### Expected Behavior
- Clicking the link should update the URL parameter without reloading the page.
- For example, if I have a list of recipes displayed on the `/recipes` page, clicking a link should add the parameter (e.g., `/recipes/1`) and load the details of the selected recipe without changing the page.

### Context
- I have a list of recipes displayed on the `/recipes` page.
- When I click on a specific recipe, I want to add a parameter to the URL (e.g., `/recipes/1`) and load the details of the selected recipe without navigating away from the current page.

### Environment
- **Next.js Version:** 5.0
- **Node.js Version:** 9.4.0

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Render the `XX` page using Express with an alias `_YY_`.
2. Include a link on the page with `href="/XX?id=1"`.
3. Click the link and observe that the URL parameter does not change.
4. Change the link to `href="_random_string_"` and observe that it works.
5. Dynamically change the subpage to `_ZZ_` and return to `_XX_`, and observe that the link works as expected.

### Additional Information
- No errors are logged in the console.
- The issue seems to be related to the alias used in the server rendering process.

Thank you for your help!
