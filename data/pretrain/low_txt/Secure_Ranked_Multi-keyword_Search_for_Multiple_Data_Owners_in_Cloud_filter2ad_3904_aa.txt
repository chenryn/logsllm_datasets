## Abstract
With the advent of cloud computing, data owners increasingly outsource their data to public cloud servers, allowing data users to retrieve these data. For privacy concerns, secure searches over encrypted cloud data have been a focus of research, primarily under the single-owner model. However, most cloud servers serve multiple owners, who share the benefits of cloud services.

In this paper, we propose schemes for secure ranked multi-keyword search in a multi-owner model. To enable cloud servers to perform secure searches without knowing the actual data of both keywords and trapdoors, we construct a novel secure search protocol. To rank search results and preserve the privacy of relevance scores between keywords and files, we introduce a new Additive Order and Privacy Preserving Function (AOPPF) family. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets confirm the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed schemes.

## 1. Introduction
Cloud computing is a transformative technology that changes how IT hardware and software are designed and purchased. It offers numerous benefits such as easy access, decreased costs, quick deployment, and flexible resource management. Enterprises of all sizes can leverage the cloud to increase innovation and collaboration.

Despite these benefits, privacy concerns prevent individuals and enterprises from outsourcing sensitive data, including emails, personal health records, and government confidential files, to the cloud. Once data is outsourced, data owners lose direct control, and cloud service providers (CSPs) may not fully protect data privacy. Encryption can preserve data privacy but makes data utilization challenging.

Secure search over encrypted data has attracted significant research interest. Song et al. [2] first defined and solved the problem of secure search over encrypted data, introducing searchable encryption. This primitive allows users to perform keyword-based searches on encrypted datasets as if they were plaintext. Subsequent work [3]-[7] extended searchable encryption, but these schemes mainly focused on single or boolean keyword searches, which are computationally and storage-intensive for ranked multi-keyword searches.

Wang et al. [8] and subsequent studies [9]-[14] addressed secure search over encrypted cloud data, reducing computational and storage costs and expanding search functionalities. However, these schemes are limited to the single-owner model, where only one data owner outsources data. In practice, cloud servers often support multiple data owners, making existing schemes impractical.

Extending single-owner schemes to multi-owner models presents several challenges. In single-owner models, data users must request secret keys from the data owner to generate trapdoors (encrypted keywords). In multi-owner models, this is infeasible due to the need for simultaneous online presence and the communication overhead of generating and sending trapdoors. Sharing a secret key among all data owners is also risky, as it creates a single point of failure.

In this paper, we address secure ranked multi-keyword search in a multi-owner cloud model. We construct a secure search protocol that allows different data owners to use different keys for encryption, enabling authorized data users to query without knowing these keys. We also propose an AOPPF to rank search results while preserving the privacy of relevance scores. Experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our schemes.

## 2. Main Contributions
- **Multi-Owner Model:** We define a multi-owner model for secure keyword search over encrypted cloud data, aligning more closely with real-world scenarios.
- **Secure Search Protocol:** We systematically construct a novel secure search protocol that enables cloud servers to perform secure ranked keyword searches without knowing the actual data of keywords and trapdoors.
- **Additive Order and Privacy Preserving Function (AOPPF):** We propose an AOPPF that allows data owners to protect the privacy of relevance scores using different functions, while still permitting the cloud server to rank data files accurately.
- **Experimental Validation:** We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets to confirm the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed schemes.

## 3. Related Work
### 3.1 Searchable Encryption
- **Early Work:** Song et al. [2] introduced searchable encryption, encrypting each word independently to allow keyword searches without revealing exact words.
- **Improvements:** Goh et al. [3] used Bloom filters, and Curtmola et al. [4] used hash tables to accelerate searches. The first public key scheme for keyword search over encrypted data was presented in [5], and [6] and [7] extended functionalities for conjunctive keyword searches.
- **Challenges:** Extending these techniques for ranked multi-keyword searches is computationally and storage-intensive.

### 3.2 Secure Keyword Search in Cloud Computing
- **Privacy Concerns:** Wang et al. [8] defined and solved secure ranked keyword search over encrypted cloud data, returning top-k relevant files for single keyword searches.
- **Extensions:** [9] and [10] extended secure keyword search for multi-keyword queries, vectorizing keywords and using matrix multiplications. Xu et al. [11] proposed MKQE, enabling dynamic keyword dictionaries. Li et al. [12] and Chuah et al. [13] introduced fuzzy keyword search, and Wang et al. [14] proposed similarity search mechanisms.
- **Limitations:** These works consider only a single data owner, leading to communication overhead in multi-owner scenarios.

### 3.3 Order Preserving Encryption
- **OPE Schemes:** Agrawal et al. [15] and Boldyreva et al. [16] introduced order-preserving encryption (OPE) schemes, but these cannot be directly used in our scheme.
- **AOPPF:** Inspired by Yi et al. [17], we propose a new family of additive order and privacy preserving functions (AOPPF) that allow data owners to use different mappings to protect relevance scores while enabling the cloud server to rank results.

## 4. Problem Formulation
### 4.1 System Model
Our multi-owner and multi-user cloud computing model involves three entities: data owners, cloud server, and data users. Data owners have a collection of files F, build a secure searchable index I on the keyword set W extracted from F, encrypt their files to get C, and outsource both C and I to the cloud server. Authorized users compute trapdoors T for keyword searches, and the cloud server returns the top-k relevant files. The system consists of six algorithms:
- **KeyGen:** Data owners generate keys for file and keyword encryption.
- **Keywords Encryption:** Each data owner uses a secret key to encrypt keywords.
- **BuildIndex:** Each data owner builds an inverted index.
- **Trapdoor Generation:** Authorized data users generate trapdoors based on their keywords.
- **Locate Keywords:** The cloud server locates keywords among different files.
- **Rank Relevance Scores:** The cloud server ranks relevance scores and returns the top-k relevant files.

### 4.2 Threat Model
Data owners and authorized data users are trusted, but the cloud server is not. The cloud server is curious but honest, following the protocol but eager to obtain encrypted file contents, keywords, and relevance scores. Data owners share a secret hash function Hs(·) unknown to the cloud server, preventing unauthorized queries.

## 5. Proposed Solution
### 5.1 Secure Search Protocol
We describe the secure search protocol in two phases:
- **Phase 1: Locating Different-Key Encrypted Keywords**
- **Phase 2: Ranking Encrypted Relevance Scores**

### 5.2 Additive Order and Privacy Preserving Function (AOPPF)
We introduce an AOPPF that allows data owners to use different functions to protect relevance scores while enabling the cloud server to rank results accurately.

## 6. Security Analysis and Potential Extensions
We analyze the security of our proposed scheme and discuss potential extensions.

## 7. Experimental Results
We present experimental results on real-world datasets to demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of our proposed schemes.

## 8. Conclusion
This paper addresses the problem of secure ranked multi-keyword search in a multi-owner cloud model. We construct a secure search protocol and propose an AOPPF to rank search results while preserving privacy. Experiments confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our schemes.
