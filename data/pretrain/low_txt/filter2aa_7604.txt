### Overview of Blockchain Security

In recent years, the field of blockchain security has seen rapid development. However, there is a lack of comprehensive information on this topic in many online resources, including Wikipedia. To address this gap, I collaborated with a few colleagues to create content focused on blockchain security. We acknowledge that some of the terminology may not be entirely precise, and we welcome any feedback or questions through our issue tracker, which we will address promptly.

This overview covers the main areas of blockchain security, primarily focusing on **public blockchain security** and **smart contract security**.
