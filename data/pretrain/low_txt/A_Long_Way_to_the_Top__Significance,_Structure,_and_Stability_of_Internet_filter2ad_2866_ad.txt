### Long-Term Study of the Alexa Top 1M

A long-term study of the Alexa Top 1M over the course of a year will measure approximately 13.5 million distinct domains. Across all lists, we find that between 20% and 33% of daily changing domains are new, meaning they are entering the list for the first time. This implies that 66% to 80% of daily changing domains are those that are repeatedly removed from and reinserted into the list. These findings, along with the equivalent figures for the Top 1k, are detailed in column µNEW of Table 2.

#### Figure 2: Domain Dynamics in Top Lists
- **(a)** Cumulative sum of all domains ever included in the Top 1M lists (similar for Top 1k).
- **(b)** List intersection against a fixed starting set (median value of seven different starting days).
- **(c)** CDF of the percentage of days that domains spend in the Top 1M and Top 1k lists.

This figure illustrates the run-up and run-down of domains and the share of days that domains spend in top lists for the JOINT dataset.

#### Figure 3: Weekday vs. Weekend Distributions and Dynamics in SLDs

- **(c)** Weekday/weekend dynamics in Umbrella Top 1M SLDs.

The KS distance method allows us to statistically determine the overlap between the distribution of a domain's ranks on weekdays and weekends. For Alexa Top 1M, approximately 35% of domains have a KS distance of one, indicating no common data points between their weekend and weekday distributions. This is also observed in Umbrella’s rankings, where over 15% of domains have a KS distance of one. The changes are less pronounced for the Top 1k lists, suggesting that top domains are more stable. Comparing weekdays to weekdays and weekends to weekends shows much lower KS distances, with 90% of domains in Alexa or Umbrella (Top 1k or Top 1M) having a distance lower than 0.05. Majestic rankings show even lower distances, with all domains having a KS distance lower than 0.02. This indicates that a significant number of domains, primarily in the long-tail, exhibit disjunct rankings between weekends and weekdays.

### Domains More Popular on Weekends
To investigate the nature of domains that change in popularity with a weekly pattern, we group domains by "second-level-domain" (SLD), defined as the label left of a public suffix per the Public Suffix list [93]. Figures 3b and 3c display the time dynamics of SLD groups for which the number of domains varies by more than 40% between weekdays and weekends. For Alexa, we observe stable behavior before its February 2018 change. Some groups, such as blogspot.* and tumblr.com, are significantly more popular on weekends, while domains under sharepoint.com (a web-based Microsoft Office platform) are more popular during the week. Umbrella shows similar behavior, with nessus.org (a threat intelligence tool) more popular during the week, and ampproject.org (a website performance optimization framework) and nflxso.net (a Netflix domain) more popular on weekends. These examples confirm that different internet usage patterns on weekends are a cause for the weekly patterns.

### Order of Domains in Top Lists
As top lists are sorted, a statistical analysis of order variation provides insight into their stability. We use the Kendall rank correlation coefficient (Kendall’s τ) to measure the similarity in the order of lists. A high Kendall’s τ indicates similar orders, while a low τ indicates dissimilar orders.

Figure 4 shows the CDF of Kendall’s τ for the Alexa, Umbrella, and Majestic Top 1k domains in two cases: (i) day-to-day comparisons, and (ii) static comparison to the first day in the JOINT dataset. For day-to-day comparisons, Majestic shows the highest similarity at 99%, followed by Alexa (72%) and Umbrella (40%). When compared to a reference day, very strong correlation drops below 5% for all lists, suggesting that order variations are not perceived in the short term but may arise over longer periods.

### Rank Variation in Top 1M Lists
Table 4 summarizes the rank variation for some more and less popular websites in the Top 1M lists, showing the lowest, highest, and median ranks for each domain across Alexa, Umbrella, and Majestic. The variability in ranks is striking, with top domains being fairly stable and bottom domains fluctuating drastically.

### Summary
Our investigation into the stability of top lists reveals abrupt changes, weekly patterns, and significant churn for some lists. Lower-ranked domains fluctuate more, but the effect varies by list and subset (Top 1k or Top 1M). We confirm that the weekly pattern stems from leisure-oriented domains being more popular on weekends and provide examples of domain rank variations.

### Understanding and Influencing Top Lists Ranking Mechanisms
We explore the ranking mechanisms of top lists, including Alexa, Umbrella, and Majestic, to understand the traffic levels required and the effort needed to manipulate a domain's ranking. Alexa’s ranking is based on its browser toolbar and other sources, Umbrella on OpenDNS queries, and Majestic on the count of subnets with inbound links. We reverse-engineer the Alexa toolbar to understand its data collection methods and find that it gathers detailed information about user demographics and browsing behavior.

### Impact on Research Results
Top lists are widely used in networking, security, and systems research, particularly in Internet measurement studies. We evaluate the impact of using top lists on research outcomes by investigating common layers like DNS and IP, and specific studies across various layers. Our evaluation focuses on three questions: (i) the bias when using a top list compared to a general population, (ii) the difference in results when using different top lists, and (iii) the difference in results when using a top list from a different day.

### DNS Resolution and Record Type Perspective
We investigate the share of NXDOMAINs and IPv6-enabled domains, and the share of CAA-enabled domains as an example of a DNS-based measurement study. The amount of NXDOMAIN responses in the Umbrella (11.5%) and Majestic (2.7%) top lists is higher than in the general population of com/net/org domains (0.8%), aligning with the fact that many domains in the Umbrella list belong to non-existent top-level domains. The NXDOMAIN share is generally stable over time, with almost no NXDOMAINs among Top 1k ranked domains.

### Umbrella Rank Depending on Probe Count and Query Frequency
To better understand Umbrella’s ranking mechanism and the required query volume, we set up RIPE Atlas measurements to query the OpenDNS resolvers for DNS names under our control. We vary the probe count and query frequency to explore the trade-offs and parameters involved in building a top list based on DNS queries.

By setting up measurements with 100, 1k, 5k, and 10k RIPE Atlas probes, and at frequencies of 1, we aim to determine the query volume required to influence a domain’s ranking in the Umbrella list.
