### 4. Vulnerabilities and Future Directions

As an Internet-based voting system, A is susceptible to various vulnerabilities and potential attacks. In this section, we will address these vulnerabilities and propose solutions that will be incorporated into future versions of the A system.

#### Distributed Key Generation
Currently, the distributed key generation subsystem in A is not universally verifiable, meaning that some authorities could misbehave without detection. This could compromise the randomness of the public keys used in elections. To address this, standard cryptographic solutions will be implemented in future versions to ensure the integrity and verifiability of the key generation process.

#### Transcript Availability and Robustness
The A system relies on an SQL database to preserve the election trail, which includes all encrypted ballots, public keys of authorities, and other auxiliary values. Although this database contains no secrets (in line with our transparency design principle), it must be available for election verification and result publication. An insider attack that deletes the database at any stage would be highly destructive. To mitigate this risk, the database will be replicated and stored at frequent intervals on remote replication servers. Future versions of A will incorporate such fault-tolerance techniques to enhance robustness.

#### Vote Buying and Coercion
In the current implementation, a malicious voting client could produce a proof of how a user voted or leak information about the voter. To counter this, future versions of A will incorporate ciphertext re-randomization, a technique that has been suggested to protect against proof-of-vote attacks in e-voting systems (cf. [10]).

#### Voter Verifiability
Currently, A does not provide a method for voters to physically verify that their published encrypted ballot corresponds to their actual choice. Instead, voters rely on the correctness of the client software. Addressing this is complex, as any method for voter-based verification could also be exploited to prove how a voter cast their vote, enabling vote buying. Future versions of A will explore ways to balance voter verifiability with the prevention of vote buying.

#### Viruses and Other Client-Environment Hazards
Cryptography alone cannot entirely solve the secure platform problem for remote Internet voting [34]. However, employing a trusted computing environment [35] can help. Many cryptographic protocols assume an ideal, virus-free environment, but this is often too optimistic. If A is run on a standard PC, the client environment can be compromised by viruses and other malicious code, leading to significant security risks. A standard approach to mitigate this is to provide a stripped-down operating environment with an authorized web browser and the A applet, which can be downloaded and burned onto a bootable CD-ROM. This allows users to boot into a clean environment, and using a free and open-source operating system as the base would enable complete auditing down to the compiler and OS level, ensuring trustworthiness [37].

#### Denial-of-Service Attacks
Like all Internet-based voting systems, A is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, which can be particularly devastating. Future versions of A will consider incorporating countermeasures to mitigate DoS attacks, such as those proposed in [39].

#### User Interaction
Computer systems running election protocols may require human operators to participate in security and integrity verification. Enabling human verifiability of secure system operation is crucial for any secure system implementation. A aims to advance our understanding of the interaction between cryptography and its users, making it an important step forward in this area.
