### 4.4.3 Analysis of User Behavior in Different Period Types

**Figure 12a** illustrates the average change in usage for each user during Type 1 periods compared to Type 3 periods. In both period types, the indicator color remained constant, but the discount in Type 1 periods was significantly higher. If users were responsive to numerical prices, we would expect an increase in usage during Type 1 periods and a decrease during Type 3 periods, with data points lying above the reference line. However, **Figure 12a** shows that only half of the users exhibited this behavior. Some users increased their usage dramatically in both period types, while most decreased their usage in both. A Wilcoxon test indicates an 82% probability that the null hypothesis (no significant difference in usage changes) is valid, suggesting that users were largely indifferent to the numerical values of the discounts when the indicator color did not change.

**Figure 12b** compares the average change in usage between Type 2 and Type 1 periods. The discounts in both periods increased by comparable amounts, but the indicator color changed from orange to green only in Type 2 periods. Most users' data points lie above the reference line, indicating that usage increased more (or decreased less) in Type 2 periods compared to Type 1 periods. The Wilcoxon test yields only a 9.8% probability that the null hypothesis is valid, suggesting that users responded to the indicator color despite the similar numerical discounts.

### 4.4.4 Benefits of Optimized Time-Dependent Pricing (TDP)

**Question:** Does peak usage decrease with time-dependent pricing? And does this decrease come at the expense of an overall decrease in usage?

**Method:** We offered optimized TDP to all users with jailbroken (JB) devices over a two-week period in January 2012. The waiting functions used to calculate these prices were estimated from usage data under static TDP. To measure peak reduction, we calculated the peak-to-average ratio (PAR), which is the ratio of usage in the peak period to the average per-period usage, for each day. We then compared the PARs from our TIP data to those observed with TUBE’s optimized TDP.

**Results:** Optimized TDP reduced the peak-to-average ratio from TIP usage. Additionally, overall usage significantly increased after TDP was introduced, partly because people used more data during discounted off-peak periods. **Figure 13a** shows the distribution of daily PARs before and after TDP was introduced. The maximum PAR decreased by 30% with TDP, and approximately 20% of the PARs before TDP were larger than the maximum PAR with TDP. This indicates that TDP significantly flattened demand over the day.

We also show that this decrease in PAR is not due to a net loss of traffic. **Figure 13b** displays the peak daily usage observed before and after TDP. Although the maximum peak usage is about the same, peak usage is generally higher with TDP. Since the PARs also decreased, usage in non-peak periods increased. In fact, we observed a 130% increase in usage from TIP to TDP. Part of this increase may be due to the time of year—TIP usage was measured from July to September, while TDP usage was measured in January. However, TDP is likely a major factor: the discounts during off-peak periods allowed users to consume more data while still spending less money and decreasing the PAR.

Finally, we examine the changes in application distribution due to the introduction of TDP. **Figure 13c** shows the average daily usage by application before TDP (i.e., during our TIP calibration period) and after TDP was introduced. Movie streaming nearly quadrupled, while usage of other applications remained relatively stable. Since streaming is generally used for entertainment, the discounts may have motivated people to consume more data during low-price periods. Thus, the "valleys" of TIP usage were further filled up by an increase in demand, creating a win-win-win scenario for end users, ISPs, and content providers.

### 5. Discussion and Future Work

#### Limitations and Extensions

**Mobility:** Mobile users may frequently switch base stations, requiring user devices to track different prices across distinct base stations. However, user mobility can often be predicted from location history [22], allowing the device to predict its location and pull prices from the appropriate base stations. The device can then keep track of the user’s bill, making this approach scalable to many users.

**Single Bottleneck:** Our model assumes a single bottleneck in the network, consistent with a wireless base station in an urban area or a middle-mile bottleneck in rural areas.

**Time Granularity:** Our initial trial used hour-long periods, as users are more familiar with hourly prices. However, we can reduce the periods to, say, 10 minutes. Shorter time periods allow users to wait less, potentially enhancing TDP’s effectiveness. If the timescale is further reduced to several seconds, the autopilot mode on user devices can respond to real-time congestion conditions, effectively turning TDP into congestion-dependent pricing.

**Trial Scale and Additional Functionalities:** Different demographics likely have different price and time sensitivities for mobile data, making our trial only the first step towards understanding TDP’s effectiveness. We are currently conducting larger-scale trials with U.S. and Indian ISPs to further illuminate users’ price-delay tradeoffs and directly test the effect of the autopilot mode.

**Control Group:** While a trial control group is highly desirable, it is challenging to compare TDP usage between one group of users and another control group of TIP users unless they are properly matched. Such matching is especially difficult in a small population of users, as in our trial. Our planned large-scale trials will address this issue.

### 6. Related Work

Internet pricing models have been debated since the 1990s. Several static and dynamic pricing schemes have been proposed by networking researchers to alleviate congestion. Static pricing plans charge users according to predetermined rates without adapting to customers’ usage behavior, such as metered, flat price, cap then metered, and two-period time-of-day pricing plans [17]. Other proposals include Clark’s Expected Capacity Pricing [3], Cocchi’s Edge Pricing [4], and Odlyzko’s Paris Metro Pricing [16], with the former two admitting dynamic versions as well.

Dynamic pricing has the advantage of adapting prices to network conditions, as shown in Gupta et al.’s Priority Pricing [7], Hayer’s Transport Auction [9], Kelly et al.’s Proportional Fair Pricing [11], Varian’s Smart Market Pricing [13], MacKie-Mason et al.’s Responsive Pricing [14], Semret et al.’s Market Pricing [19], etc. Sen et al. [20] provide a detailed overview of these various pricing proposals and their realization in current data plans. The social and ethical dimensions of dynamic pricing have also been widely studied, and its consumer adoption and benefits in electricity and transportation networks are well documented [20]. However, there have been no documented trials of dynamic pricing for mobile data.

### 7. Conclusion

Although time-dependent pricing for mobile data has been discussed for several decades, no experimental study has been conducted to investigate a functional prototype. To this end, we developed and implemented TUBE, an architecture that translates TDP from economic theory into a system implementation. TUBE creates a feedback loop between the ISP’s price computation and users’ ever-changing responses to these prices. To link these components, we estimate and predict users’ future behavior each day using aggregate usage data. Users respond to the prices via a GUI on their devices, either manually or using an autopilot mode.

To confirm TDP’s feasibility, we conducted a trial with 50 iPhone/iPad 3G data plan users, acting as a resale ISP and charging them according to our TDP algorithms. Our trial results indicate that people are sensitive to time-dependent prices and indeed shift their Internet usage to off-peak periods, while increasing their monthly total data usage. TDP flattens the temporal distribution of user demand for data, reducing ISP costs while allowing users to save money. This implementation and pilot trial motivate future studies on time-dependent pricing for different markets and demographics.
