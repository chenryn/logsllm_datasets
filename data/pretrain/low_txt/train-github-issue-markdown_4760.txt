### Summary of the New Feature/Enhancement

This enhancement allows users to map the Windows key by itself as a shortcut for PowerTools Run, effectively disabling the launch of the Windows Start menu. However, it will still permit the use of Windows key combinations (such as WIN+L, WIN+1, WIN+TAB, etc.) to function as usual. Users can still access the Start menu or its search functionality by clicking with the mouse.

**Reason:**
I would like to replace the traditional Windows menu and search with this more efficient alternative.
