### 4.5.4 Declining Cookies

For Q7 (Decline), we received 94 responses across the three studies, and identified ten themes. The most prominent expectation was that declining cookies would prevent access to the website (28 responses). For example, one participant stated, "I don’t get access to the desired information" (1-282), while another said, "The site closes itself and you are redirected to the search engine" (2-685). Seventeen other participants expected parts of the website not to work, with one noting, "I won’t be able to use some functionality because [...] cookies fund the website" (2-255). Only four participants explicitly mentioned that they would still be able to access the site, such as, "Normally I can continue to navigate the site" (Figure 6: Visitors’ interactions with different consent mechanisms in Experiment 3. Notices contained technical language ("cookies") and a link to the privacy policy (or not)).

Some participants reported that the notice appeared in a background browser tab, so they had only seen the invitation to take the survey. Two participants noted that the notice had been auto-replaced before they could interact with it.

### 4.5.2 Perception of Complex Consent Notices

We asked survey participants who saw a category- or vendor-based notice to elaborate on their choice selection (Q6) to understand how they perceived purpose-based consent mechanisms as required by the GDPR. We received 38 responses across Experiments 2 and 3. Appendix B lists the codes and their distribution for this and the following open-response questions.

A recurring theme in the responses was transparency, mentioned by five participants who had seen a category-based notice. One participant noted, "[I liked] that I could directly select the options without going to the settings. It would be great if this was the default" (3-171). Another stated, "What I like [here] is that only [the ...] necessary option is selected and all of the others are deactivated" (3-88).

One participant with experience in online shopping commented, "It has only happened twice that [a] site has kicked me out. But online shopping [is] difficult if you don’t agree" (2-94). Three participants expected no collection or processing of personal data when cookies are declined but still had doubts, such as, "I hope that no data is collected" (1-177, 1-121, 3-216). Twelve participants expected the site to behave as if "Accept" were clicked, with one saying, "I guess my data is still collected" (1-170), and another stating, "Nothing, of course. Me not accepting cookies does not mean that the site uses less or no cookies or does not collect any data about me" (2-630).

Other recurring themes included the expectation to see fewer ads, a focus on technical aspects (e.g., "no cookies are evaluated" [3-217]), and whether the notice would disappear or reappear. See Appendix B for more details.

### 4.5.5 Accepting Cookies

For Q8 (Accept), which was also answered by 94 participants (not all the same respondents as for Q7), we identified ten themes. Twenty-nine participants expected their personal data to be collected and/or processed, with one stating, "my behavior on the website is stored and analyzed" (2-216), and another noting, "my data is shared with who knows what third parties [...] Facebook, Google, marketing / market research / ad analytics [...]" (2-557). Nineteen responses focused on technical aspects, such as, "a cookie is set which recognizes me when I revisit the website" (1-250).

Twenty-one participants stated that the website would only work if they allowed cookies, with examples like, "I can read the article" (2-53) and "I can continue to use the website" (2-405). Other themes included effects on the consent notice only, such as, "the banner disappears" (2-675), and concerns about personal data being collected for advertising, user profiling, and other purposes, e.g., "sale to third parties" (3-171), "influencing Internet algorithms" (1-269), and "any purpose" (1-207, 3-64). Seven participants believed it made no difference what was clicked but did not specify the "default" behavior of the website.

These answers indicate that our participants had some understanding of how cookies are used, e.g., to recognize recurring visitors and for ad tracking and targeting. Concerningly, almost a quarter of participants thought they had to accept cookies before accessing a website, suggesting that negative experiences on some sites may influence general expectations and behavior across websites. A transparent and GDPR-compliant consent notice should inform users which website functionality may not work as intended if cookies are declined.

### 5 RELATED WORK

Multiple measurement studies have provided insights into the prevalence of consent notices [5, 12, 49]. Even though many consent notice libraries can be configured to display notices only to EU visitors [12], van Eijk et al. [49] found that a website’s top-level domain was the primary factor in whether a consent notice was displayed rather than a visitor’s location.

Sanchez-Rola et al. [38] evaluated the functionality of consent notices and opt-out mechanisms under GDPR. They manually visited 2,000 popular websites, tried to opt out of data collection whenever possible, and studied the effects on the website’s cookies. They found that 92% of websites set at least one high-entropy cookie before showing any kind of notice. Only 4% of notices provided an opt-out choice, and 2.5% of websites removed some cookies upon opt-out. Degeling et al. [12] further found that many third-party consent libraries either lack the functionality to block or delete cookies, or require significant modification of a website to properly react to visitors’ consent choices.

In Section 2, we presented a detailed analysis of variants in consent notices' user interfaces. Previous work had only classified consent notices by the provided information [22], the choices offered [12, 38], and if the notice blocks access to the website [38]. Van Eijk et al. [49] report some statistics on the height and width of consent notices, their location offset, and notices’ word and link/button counts.

Kulyk et al. [22] investigated users’ perceptions of and reactions to differently worded cookie consent notices. They identified five categories of disclaimers based on the amount of information provided about the purposes of cookie use and the parties involved. In a qualitative user study, they found that the text of a cookie notice does not significantly influence users’ decisions to continue using a website; their decision was rather based on the website’s perceived trustworthiness and relevance. Participants perceived cookie consent notices as a nuisance or threat to their privacy and reported lacking information about the implications of cookies and possible countermeasures.

Warning research and ad placement studies provide insights into the effects of user interface design choices on user attention and behavior, including color [40] and position [9]. Studies investigating different notice designs have been conducted for SSL [16], browser security [33], and phishing warnings [13].

Mathur et al. [28] classified common dark patterns in web services. In their classification scheme, the observed actions are described as "sneaking" (attempting to misrepresent user actions or delay information that, if made available to users, they would likely object to), "misdirection" (using visuals, language, or emotion to steer users toward or away from making a particular choice), and "forced action" (forcing the user to do something additional to complete their task).

Users’ perceptions of consent notices’ choice architectures have been partially studied before. Boerman et al. [7], using Dutch panel data, explored how users protect their online privacy. Given the opportunity to decline cookies, many participants self-reported that they decline cookies "often" (16%) or "very often" (17%). Facing the decision to either accept cookies or leave the website, 12% and 13% reported refraining from using the site "often" and "very often," respectively.

Previous work has shown that cookies are poorly understood by web users. Ha et al. [19] studied the usability of two cookie management tools in focus groups, identifying misconceptions about cookies and risks associated with them. Kulyk et al. [23] developed and tested a privacy-friendly cookie settings interface for the Chrome browser and found that users appreciate tools that help them better understand the standard browser cookie settings, such as an assistant that transforms users’ privacy preferences into cookie settings or additional explanations about the purpose and security/privacy implications of different types of cookies.

Consent notices are not the only way for web users to opt out of targeted advertising. Previous work has evaluated the usability of different opt-out tools [18, 20, 24] and found that users find it difficult to locate, configure, and understand these mechanisms. Schaub et al. describe the design space for privacy notices and controls, including consent notices and permission prompts on mobile devices [39].

### 6 DISCUSSION

We conducted three experiments evaluating the effects of cookie consent notices’ position, choices, and content on people’s consent behavior. In the following, we describe recommendations based on our findings and discuss limitations of our approach.

#### 6.1 Recommendations

Our experiments investigated different notice positions, details of the choices offered, and the wording of cookie consent notices. Future guidelines for consent notices should consider the following recommendations:

**Position:** Experiment 1 showed that the position of a notice has a substantial impact on whether a website visitor engages with the notice. A dialog box in the lower left corner (on desktop) or the lower part of the screen (on mobile) significantly increases the chance that a user makes a consent decision. While we expected higher interaction rates on mobile devices for this position since it is easy to reach with the thumb, we were surprised by the impact on desktop users, given the general wisdom that content in the top left receives the most attention in cultures with left-to-right writing. This result could be related to our partner website, like many websites, displaying a header that shifts content to lower parts of the screen. This experiment shows that the second most common notice position observed in practice, the top position (see Table 1), results in notices being ignored by users.

**Choices:** Our results from Experiment 2 showed that nudging (highlighting "Accept" buttons or pre-selecting checkboxes) substantially affects people’s acceptance of cookies, providing clear evidence for the interference of such dark patterns with people’s consent decisions. Given a binary choice, more visitors accepted cookies than declined them, which could be evidence for the adverse effects of consent bundling on consent decisions, which is not allowed under the GDPR. Surprisingly, rejection rates in the vendor- and cookie-based conditions were close to those in the binary condition, although visitors had to make five to six additional clicks to reach the same goal. This suggests that people who want to decline cookies are willing to expend extra effort.

Moreover, the survey answers show that participants think that no data is collected unless they make a decision, showing that privacy by default is the expected functionality, although this is not the current practice.

**Text:** While we did not see an effect in Experiment 3 from including a privacy policy link in the notice, we found that mentioning "cookies" made more users reject the data collection. The negative effect of mentioning cookies can be related to the fact that internet users generally have a negative feeling about them [19, 22].

It is clear that the current ecosystem of mechanisms to prompt for user consent, with a plethora of combinations regarding the provided information, the granularity of user options, and how and if their choice is enforced, provides no real improvement for user privacy compared to pre-GDPR times. At the same time, many things are still in flux, with regulators publishing differing guidelines on how to obtain consent, the online advertising industry developing and updating proposals for consent frameworks, and legal and technical scholars evaluating them. While some claim [36] that many underlying principles of the online advertising industry are not compatible with the GDPR at all, the regulation so far has only partially affected how companies process personal data [48].

We hope that our results can inform future discussions, not only with recommendations for the design of consent notices. Given that very few users are currently willing to give consent to any form of processing of their personal data, we think that the business model of online behavioral advertising, which targets ads based on large amounts of personal data, should be challenged, and alternative models like privacy-friendly contextual advertising or other ways of monetization for web services need to be developed.

#### 6.2 Limitations

Our study has some potential limitations. First, our sample is biased as we conducted all experiments on a German-language e-commerce website whose visitors may not be representative of the general public. However, our partnership with this website gave us control over the notice implementation and access to a high number of unique visitors. We validated some of our results with data from Cookiebot, which showed similar results (see Section 4.3.3). Overall, it seems our sample is more inclined towards rejecting cookies, and we must assume that, in general, a higher percentage of users may allow cookies.

Our field study did not allow us to collect more detailed information about visitors, such as their specific device, the size of the notice on the screen, or how long they stayed on the website, which could potentially have an effect on consent behavior. Furthermore, many visitors did not interact with the notice at all and spent only a short period of time on the site. While this could be related to the notice, it is not unusual that most visitors leave a site after a few seconds. Liu et al. [25] showed that website dwell time has a negative aging effect. Users first skim a site to decide whether they will stay on it. Since we were not able to measure the exact time visitors stayed on the site, we included all users for whom the logged data indicated a fully loaded page, which results in a high number of "no action" visitors. From a legal perspective, the time spent on the site does not affect the need to request consent. Our partner website also does not have user accounts. Past research has shown that visitors tend to underestimate the amount of personal data collected by websites on which they do not create an account and enter personal data [32]. This may cause them to underestimate the privacy implications of allowing cookie use, but we did not see evidence for this in the survey responses.

Responses to our voluntary survey are likely biased due to participants’ self-selection. Responses to the question about possible data collection suggest that participants had a good understanding of the technical background or an interest in privacy. Of the survey participants, 61 had previously interacted with our consent notices, and 49 had not, showing that the results are only partially biased towards those who care about notices. We considered this bias when interpreting results.

### 7 CONCLUSION

We conducted the first large-scale field study on the effect of cookie consent notices on people’s consent behavior. Cookie notices have seen widespread adoption since the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation went into effect in May 2018. Our findings show that a substantial number of users are willing to engage with consent notices, especially those who want to opt out or do not want to opt in to cookie use. At the same time, position, offered choices, nudging, and wording substantially affect people’s consent behavior. Unfortunately, many current cookie notice implementations do not make use of the available design space, offering no meaningful choice to consumers. Our results further indicate that the GDPR’s principles of data protection by default and purpose-based consent would require websites to use consent notices that would actually lead to less than 0.1% of users actively consenting to the use of third-party cookies.
