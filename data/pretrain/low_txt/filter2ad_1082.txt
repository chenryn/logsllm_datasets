## Abstract

The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to seamlessly connect everything and everyone, promising smart environments, Industry 4.0, intelligent infrastructure management, environmental monitoring, and disaster recovery. The rapid increase in the number of interconnected devices poses significant challenges in ensuring their security, the security of their networks, and the privacy of the data they collect. The Workshop on Trustworthy Embedded Devices (TrustED) focuses on all aspects of security and privacy related to embedded systems and the IoT. TrustED 2015 continues a successful series of workshops held in conjunction with ESORICS 2011, IEEE Security & Privacy 2012, ACM CCS 2013, and ACM CCS 2014 (see [http://www.trusted-workshop.de](http://www.trusted-workshop.de) for details). The goal of this workshop is to bring together experts from academia, research institutes, industry, and government in the field of security and privacy in cyber-physical systems.

## 1. Background and Motivation

The paradigm of ubiquitous computing and permanent, mobile connectivity has already become a reality through modern technologies that allow electronic systems to be embedded practically everywhere, most prominently in smartphones. Examples of such ubiquitous interconnected systems include sensor nodes, smart meters, femtocells, automotive platforms, home gateways, smart homes, and IPTV boxes, among others. Unfortunately, the new opportunities created by smart environments and infrastructures also come with new security and privacy risks, particularly when embedded systems are involved. These systems, which we interact with closely and sometimes unknowingly in our daily lives, differ significantly from "classical" systems like desktop PCs in several ways:

- **Constrained Resources:** They have limited power, memory, and computational capabilities, necessitating the redesign of standard security solutions.
- **Ease of Accessibility:** Malicious parties can easily access, replace, or physically tamper with them.
- **Connectivity:** Most (future) embedded devices will be network-enabled and often connected to more powerful devices or gateways, making them prime targets for network attacks.

Thus, the challenge is to develop security solutions that guarantee trust, security, and privacy while meeting the constraints of embedded systems. Additionally, ensuring security across different layers of the embedded system (hardware, OS, and application) while minimizing overhead is both a challenge and a requirement for successful system deployment.

## 2. Scope and Objectives

TrustED considers selected security and privacy aspects of cyber-physical systems and their environments, which influence trust and trust establishment in such environments. A major theme of TrustED 2015 was the security and privacy aspects of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. The IoT promises to realize Mark Weiser's vision of ubiquitous computation as set out in his influential 1991 paper. However, to make this vision successful, it is widely acknowledged that the security of super-large distributed systems must be guaranteed, and the privacy of the collected data must be protected. Submissions exploring new paradigms to assure security and privacy in the IoT are strongly encouraged.

The workshop topics include (but are not limited to) the following:

- Embedded system security
- Hardware-entangled cryptography
- New Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) constructions and novel applications
- Remote attestation and integrity verification
- Secure execution environments (e.g., TrustZone, TPMs) on mobile devices
- Privacy aspects of embedded systems (e.g., medical devices, electronic IDs)
- Physical and logical convergence (e.g., secure and privacy-preserving facility management)
- New protection paradigms for trustworthy embedded systems
- Novel paradigms to establish trust in large distributed environments
- Novel security architectures for the IoT
