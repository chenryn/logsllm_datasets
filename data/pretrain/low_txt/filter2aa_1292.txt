## Do Bug Hunters Touch Your Data?
- **Job done.**
- **Crap.**
- **Yes.**
- **Not yet.**

### Data Everywhere
- **Data Flow Diagram:**
  - Employee Laptop
  - XSSHunter (or similar third-party tools)
  - Gmail
  - My Hard Drive
  - Time Machine
  - Bug Tracker

### Incident Example
- **Example Incident:**
  - "Your PoC exfiltrated email addresses, but other PII could have been hypothetically at risk. The user base was relatively small (a few thousand) as this was an experimental project."
  - "Be sure that any PII in your PoC should be obfuscated. We are excited to be included in your talk and help give back to the security community."

### Data Retention and Notification
- **Asked to delete data?** No.
- **Maintain data access through ticket?** Yes.
- **Disclosure notifications?** Not to my knowledge.

### Other Researchers
- **Examples:**
  - [Gaining Access to Uber's User Data Through AMPscript Evaluation](https://blog.assetnote.io/bug-bounty/2019/01/14/gaining-access-to-ubers-user-data-through-ampscript-evaluation/)
  - [Hacking Starbucks](https://samcurry.net/hacking-starbucks/)

### Common Practices
- **Asked to delete data?** No.
- **Maintain data access through ticket?** Yes.

### Why Does It Happen?
- **Accidents vs. Intentional:**
  - Sometimes it’s an accident.
  - Sometimes it’s not an accident.
- **Incentives:**
  - Bountier incentives
  - Triager incentives
