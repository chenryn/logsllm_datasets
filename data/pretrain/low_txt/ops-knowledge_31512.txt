After several months of successful and uninterrupted continuous integration, my Hudson instance, running on Mac OS X 10.7.4 Lion, has started entering shutdown mode after 20-30 minutes of inactivity.

For those familiar with this behavior, the Hudson instance does not fully shut down, but it stops new jobs from starting, which is undesirable in this case. I am certain that I have not changed any settings, leading me to believe that the issue may have been gradually developing over time.

I have confirmed that there is ample storage space available (over 400 GB), so disk space is not the cause. I am unsure what else could be triggering the shutdown mode without manually doing so through the Hudson web portal.

The problem appears to be linked to inactivity. As a temporary fix, I created a build job that runs every 5 minutes and does nothing. This seemed to work initially, but after extended periods of inactivity, the instance would still revert to shutdown mode.

### Solution: Disable the thinBackup Plugin

Upon reviewing the Hudson logs at `http://localhost:8080/log/all`, I noticed that the thinBackup plugin was active each time the Hudson instance entered shutdown mode. The fact that shutdown mode occurred during periods of inactivity aligns with the behavior of the thinBackup plugin.

To resolve the issue, I disabled the thinBackup plugin, and the Hudson instance no longer enters shutdown mode. It is worth noting that the thinBackup plugin had been installed for some time before this problem began. I am currently seeking a solution from the thinBackup developers to re-enable the plugin without the negative effects. I will update this post if I receive a resolution.
