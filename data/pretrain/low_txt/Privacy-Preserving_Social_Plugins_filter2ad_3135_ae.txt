### Threats to User Privacy in Social Networking Sites (SNSs)

The combination of personal information within an SNS can pose a significant threat to user privacy. Extensive research has been conducted on the interplay between SNSs and privacy. For instance, some studies have focused on protecting privacy in SNSs against third-party applications installed in a user's profile [41, 40, 55]. 

**Facecloak** [49] is a system that shields a user’s personal information from both the SNS and any third-party interactions by providing fake information to the SNS and storing actual, sensitive information in an encrypted form on a separate server. **FlyByNight** [48] proposes the use of public key cryptography among friends in an SNS to protect their information from a curious social provider and potential data leaks.

Recent work has also addressed how to support personalized advertisements without revealing the user’s personal information to the providing party. **Adnostic** [57] offers targeted advertising while preserving the user’s privacy by having the web browser profile the user through monitoring their browsing history and inferring their interests. The browser then downloads diverse content from the advertising server and selects which part to display to the user. Similarly, **RePriv** [42] enables the browser to mine a user’s web behavior to infer guidelines for content personalization, which are ultimately communicated to interested sites. Our approach differs in principle because these previous systems prevent a website from building a profile for the user, whereas we decouple the identification step the user undergoes to access their existing social profile with their subsequent requests for content personalization.

**Mayer et al.** [50] highlight the threats to user privacy posed by the cross-site tracking capabilities of third-party web services. They detail a plethora of tracking technologies used by embedded pages of advertisements, analytics, and social networking services. Their work demonstrates the high level of sophistication in web tracking technologies and their resilience against browser countermeasures.

**Roesner et al.** [53] study the tracking ecosystem of third-party web services and discuss current defenses, including third-party cookie blocking. They identify cases where tracking services actively try to evade such restrictions by positioning themselves as first parties, e.g., by spawning pop-up windows. Additionally, they present cases where services are treated as first parties when visited directly and intentionally by users, but appear embedded as third parties in websites, as is the case with social networking services and their social plugins. Overall, they conclude that current restrictions imposed by browsers against third-party tracking are not foolproof, and they find more than 500 tracking services, some with the capability to capture more than 20% of a user’s browsing behavior.

Several browser add-ons exist [7, 26] that block social plugins from web pages by removing them or preventing them from loading, similar to what **Adblock** [1] does for advertisements. However, this comes at the cost of full loss of functionality, as social plugins are completely removed from a page. Some of these add-ons are poorly implemented and naively remove the social plugins only after they have appeared on a page, meaning that the corresponding HTTP request containing user-identifying information has already been issued to the server.

**ShareMeNot** [28, 53] is a Firefox add-on that strips user cookies from a series of HTTP requests that the web browser issues to load social plugins. As a result, no user-identifying information is sent to the social networking service until the user explicitly interacts with the social plugin. The downside of this approach is that users are deprived of any personalized information offered by the plugin, such as the number and names of friends who have interacted with a page. In other words, users view these social plugins as if they were logged out from the respective SNS (or browsing in “incognito” mode). Our approach differs from ShareMeNot in that it focuses on providing the full content personalization of existing social plugins while protecting user privacy.

### Conclusion

Concerns about the interplay between social plugins and privacy are mounting rapidly. Tensions have reached the point where even governments are considering outlawing Facebook’s Like button [13]. Recently, in an official response to questions regarding user privacy asked by the government of Norway, it was stated that “Facebook does not use cookies to track people visiting websites using the Like button” [37]. The current design of social plugins, as provided by all major social networking services, combined with empirical evidence [9], stresses the need for changes so that words align with actions. We want to believe that SNSs treat the privacy of their members as an issue of utmost importance and hope that they are willing to ensure it through technical means.

In this paper, we have presented a novel design for privacy-preserving social plugins that provide exactly the same user experience as existing plugins while preventing SNSs from being able to track the browsing activities of their users. We have described in detail how this design can be offered transparently as a service to users of existing SNSs without the need to install any additional software, and thus envisage that it could be adopted for the protection of their member’s privacy. **SafeButton**, our proof-of-concept implementation of this design as a browser add-on for Firefox, demonstrates the practicality of our approach. SafeButton is publicly available and currently supports full content personalization in a privacy-preserving way with minimal space overhead for seven out of the nine social plugins offered by Facebook, while loading them 2.8 times faster compared to their original versions.
