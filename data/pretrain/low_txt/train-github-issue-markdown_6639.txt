After upgrading to VSCode 0.10.6, I have been experiencing IntelliSense suggestions while writing line comments (starting with `//`) in C# projects. I primarily use VSCode for developing Unity3D projects on macOS 10.11.2.

This behavior is quite disruptive. For example, when I type "will do" in a comment, the word "do" is automatically completed into a full `do...while` loop. This makes the coding process much more frustrating and inefficient.
