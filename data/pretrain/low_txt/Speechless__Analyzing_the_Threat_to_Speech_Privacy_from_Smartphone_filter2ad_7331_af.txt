**Figure 4:** Spectrum showing motion sensor readings along the x-axis in the presence of a male voice pronouncing "OH" in a loudspeaker setup. There is a lack of noticeable effect on the gyroscope spectrum for both scenarios, while the accelerometer spectrum shows the existence of speech for the same surface scenario.

**Figure 5:** Spectrum of the motion sensors in the presence of a phone speaker pronouncing "OH," indicating the lack of any observable effect on motion sensor readings for the setup with a phone speaker and a different smartphone containing motion sensors residing on the same surface.

**Figure 6:** Comparison of sensor behavior under ambient locations and in the presence of speech in the Phone-Different-Surface scenario. Maximum variance in sensor readings (in the absence of speech) at quiet locations 1, 2, 3, 4 is plotted alongside maximum variance in sensor readings (in the presence of speech) to determine the effect of speech on sensors. The blue line (maximum variance in the presence of speech) closely follows the rest of the lines (that represent maximum variance in the absence of speech), indicating similar behavior of sensors in quiet locations and under the effect of speech from a phone speaker placed on a different surface.

**Figure 7:** Spectrum of the motion sensors in the presence of a human speaker (loud) pronouncing "OH," indicating the lack of any observable effect on motion sensor readings for the setup with a smartphone (with motion sensors) under the effect of a human speaker in a loud voice.

**Figure 8:** Spectrum of the motion sensors in the presence of a human speaker (normal) pronouncing "OH," indicating the lack of any observable effect on motion sensor readings for the setup with a smartphone (with motion sensors) under the effect of a human speaker in a normal voice.
