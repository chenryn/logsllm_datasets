### API Connection Description and Rationale

#### Control: Logic App Connectors Must Use AAD-Based Authentication Wherever Possible
- **Rationale**: Utilizing Azure Active Directory (AAD) for authentication leverages the built-in high level of assurance in user identity, which is essential for subsequent access control. All enterprise subscriptions are automatically linked to their enterprise directory (e.g., `xxx.onmicrosoft.com`), and users within this directory are trusted for authentication to these subscriptions.
- **Severity**: High
- **Automated Fix Script Available**: Yes
- **Manual Fix Required**: No

#### Control: Data Transit Across Connectors Must Use Encrypted Channels
- **Rationale**: Using HTTPS ensures server/service authentication and protects data in transit from various network layer attacks, such as man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, and session-hijacking.
- **Severity**: High
- **Automated Fix Script Available**: Yes
- **Manual Fix Required**: No

This structure provides a clear and organized presentation of the controls, their rationale, severity, and whether automated or manual fixes are available.
