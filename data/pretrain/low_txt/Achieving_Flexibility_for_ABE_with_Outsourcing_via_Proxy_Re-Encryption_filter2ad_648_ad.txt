### Semi-Functional Secret Key Generation

The system generates one type of semi-functional secret key based on the input type, which can be 1, 2, or 3. The generation process is as follows:

- For \(\vec{C}_1\):
  \[
  \vec{C}_1 = \vec{g}_c(\vec{s}, \vec{h})
  \]
- For \(\vec{R}_3\):
  \[
  \vec{R}_3 \leftarrow \mathbb{Z}_N
  \]
  \[
  \vec{C}_1 = \vec{g}_c(\vec{s}, \vec{h}) \cdot \vec{g}_c(\vec{s}, 2) \leftarrow \mathbb{Z}_{m_2}^N
  \]

The semi-functional secret key \(\Pi_0.SKX\) is defined as:
\[
\Pi_0.SKX = 
\begin{cases}
\vec{g}_k(0, \vec{h}, \vec{r}) \cdot \vec{g}_k(\hat{\alpha}, \vec{h}, \vec{r}) \cdot \vec{g}_k(\hat{\alpha}, \vec{0}, \vec{0}) \cdot \vec{g}_k(R_3, 3) \cdot \vec{g}_k(\vec{R}_3, 3) \cdot \vec{g}_k(\vec{R}_3, 3) \cdot \vec{g}_k(\alpha, \vec{h}, \vec{r}) \cdot \vec{g}_k(\alpha, \vec{h}, \vec{r}) \cdot \vec{g}_k(\alpha, \vec{h}, \vec{r}) & \text{if } \text{type} = 1 \\
\vec{g}_k(0, \vec{h}, \vec{r}) \cdot \vec{g}_k(\hat{\alpha}, \vec{h}, \vec{r}) \cdot \vec{g}_k(\hat{\alpha}, \vec{0}, \vec{0}) \cdot \vec{g}_k(R_3, 3) \cdot \vec{g}_k(\vec{R}_3, 3) \cdot \vec{g}_k(\vec{R}_3, 3) \cdot \vec{g}_k(\alpha, \vec{h}, \vec{r}) \cdot \vec{g}_k(\alpha, \vec{h}, \vec{r}) \cdot \vec{g}_k(\alpha, \vec{h}, \vec{r}) & \text{if } \text{type} = 2 \\
\vec{g}_k(0, \vec{h}, \vec{r}) \cdot \vec{g}_k(\hat{\alpha}, \vec{h}, \vec{r}) \cdot \vec{g}_k(\hat{\alpha}, \vec{0}, \vec{0}) \cdot \vec{g}_k(R_3, 3) \cdot \vec{g}_k(\vec{R}_3, 3) \cdot \vec{g}_k(\vec{R}_3, 3) \cdot \vec{g}_k(\alpha, \vec{h}, \vec{r}) \cdot \vec{g}_k(\alpha, \vec{h}, \vec{r}) \cdot \vec{g}_k(\alpha, \vec{h}, \vec{r}) & \text{if } \text{type} = 3
\end{cases}
\]

### Re-Encryption Key Generation

The re-encryption key \(rk_{\Pi_0.X \rightarrow \Pi_i.Y}\) is generated as follows:
- Run \((\vec{k}; m_2) \leftarrow \text{Enc}_1(\Pi_0.X, N)\), pick \(\delta \leftarrow \mathbb{G}_T\), and \(\vec{r}_2 \leftarrow \mathbb{Z}_{m_2}^N\).
- Compute:
  \[
  \vec{rk} = 
  \begin{cases}
  \vec{g}_k(0, \vec{h}, \vec{r}_2) \cdot (\Pi_0.SKX)_{H(\delta)} & \text{if } \text{type} = 1 \\
  \vec{g}_k(0, \vec{h}, \vec{r}_2) \cdot (\Pi_0.SKX)_{H(\delta)} & \text{if } \text{type} = 2 \\
  \vec{g}_k(0, \vec{h}, \vec{r}_2) \cdot (\Pi_0.SKX)_{H(\delta)} & \text{if } \text{type} = 3
  \end{cases}
  \]
- Encrypt \(\delta\) using \(\Pi_i\)'s public key and attribute \(Y\):
  \[
  \Pi_i.\vec{C} \leftarrow \Pi_i.\text{Enc}(\Pi_i.PK, \Pi_i.Y, \delta)
  \]

### Proof Overview

We use a sequence of games to prove the security of the system. Each game is defined as follows:

- **Game Real (Gamer eal)**: This is the real game as defined in Section 3.1.
- **Game ES (Gamer es)**: This game is nearly the same as Game Real, except that all attribute queries to \(O_0\) are such that \(Rp_2(\Pi_0.X, \Pi_0.Y^*) = 0\) rather than \(RN(\Pi_0.X, \Pi_0.Y^*) = 0\).
- **Modify \(\Pi_0.CT^*\)**: Modify \(\Pi_0.CT^* \leftarrow \text{SFEncrypt}(\Pi_0.Y^*, M_b, \Pi_0.PK, g_2, \vec{h})\).
- **Game 0 (Game0)**: Run \(\text{SFSetup}(1^\lambda, k)\) in the setup phase.
- **Game k (Gamek)**: For key queries and re-encryption key queries made by \(A\), \(C\) answers the \(j\)-th query by generating the corresponding secret key as follows:
  - \(\hat{\alpha}_j \leftarrow \mathbb{Z}_N\)
  - \(\text{SK}_{X_j} \leftarrow \text{SFKeyGen}(\Pi_0.X_j, \Pi_0.MSK, \Pi_0.PK, g_2, 3, \hat{\alpha}_j, \vec{0}, \vec{0})\)
- **Final Game (Gamefinal)**: Modify \(M \leftarrow \mathcal{M}\), and \(\Pi_0.CT^* \leftarrow \text{SFEncrypt}(\Pi_0.Y^*, M, \Pi_0.PK, g_2, \vec{h})\).

### Indistinguishability of Games

The proof structure is as follows:
\[
\text{Gr eal} \rightarrow \text{Gr es} \rightarrow G_0 \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow G_{k-1} \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow G_k \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow G_{q_1 + q_2} \rightarrow \text{Gf inal}
\]

### Semi-Functional Key Invariance

The proof structure is similar to [2], but our simulator needs to handle the simulation for re-encryption key queries from \(\Pi_0.X_k\) to \(\Pi_i.Y_k\) in each phase. This additional complexity means the original indistinguishability between \(G_{k-1}\) and \(G_k\) does not hold if we use the techniques from [2]. We provide the proof of indistinguishability between these two games in Appendix A.

### Handling Re-Encryption Key Queries

The main difference in our proof is that the adversary can make re-encryption key queries from \(\Pi_0.X_k\) to \(\Pi_i.Y_k\) in each phase. To address this, we divide the \(k\)-th query into two cases:

- **Case 1**: \(R(\Pi_0.X_k, \Pi_0.Y^*) = 0\). The secret key of attribute \(\Pi_0.X_j\) cannot decrypt the challenge ciphertext. The security proof in this case is similar to the adaptive security of an ABE scheme.
- **Case 2**: \(R(\Pi_0.X_k, \Pi_0.Y^*) = 1\). The secret key of attribute \(\Pi_0.X_j\) can decrypt the challenge ciphertext. Additional techniques are required to simulate the re-encryption key, leveraging the fact that the simulator masks \(\delta\) with chosen-plaintext security.

### Enhanced Security

When the target PKE scheme \(\Pi\) has enhanced security guarantees, such as leakage-resilience or related-key attack resilience, the resulting CS-PRE scheme can also be resilient to side-channel attacks or related-key attacks. For a detailed discussion, see the full version of this paper.

### Discussion

Compared to composite-order groups, schemes in prime-order groups are more efficient. Recent techniques by Chen et al. [12, 13] simulate composite-order groups in prime-order groups, but these techniques are not directly applicable to our framework due to the need for different intermediate results in the re-encryption algorithm. We seek new techniques for constructing attribute-based proxy re-encryption schemes in prime-order groups.
