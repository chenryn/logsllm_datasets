### VIII. Related Work

User authentication is typically based on three distinct factors: something the user knows, something the user has, and something the user is. Many traditional authentication methods rely on the first two factors. Passwords remain widely used and are often complemented by physical tokens, such as RSA SecurID [14]. However, these methods require the deployment and carrying of tokens, which can be inconvenient.

A significant body of research has explored biometric authentication, including the use of fingerprints [11], hand geometry [21], iris patterns [10], facial recognition [4], and blood vessel information [30]. Biometric authentication is appealing because it reduces the user's burden by eliminating the need to memorize secrets or carry external tokens. However, these methods can still be vulnerable to spoofing and raise new issues, such as revocation and privacy concerns. Additionally, traditional biometric authentication is not transparent to the user.

The desire to minimize the user's effort in authentication has led to the development of transparent and continuous authentication schemes. One approach involves proximity-based authentication, where the presence of a personal device (e.g., using RFID, NFC, Bluetooth, or WiFi signal strength) is used to authenticate the user. The advantage of this method is the seamless integration with existing devices, but it suffers from limited accuracy and vulnerability to spoofing and replay attacks [18] [19] [15].

Behavioral biometrics, which consider behaviors unique to specific individuals, have also been explored. A common example is gait, identified from video or acceleration data. Gafurov et al. [16] developed an authentication system based on a user's gait, characterized by recorded accelerations from a hip-worn device. They also addressed spoofing attacks against gait-based authentication [17]. Another subset of behavioral biometrics includes keystroke and typing-based authentication. Early work by Joyce et al. [20] and Monrose et al. [25] [24] focused on identifying users based on their typing rhythm, considering inter-key latencies. More recently, Ahmed et al. [1] explored mouse dynamics for authentication, while De Luca et al. [13] distinguished users based on touch screen input patterns. However, Tey et al. [27] demonstrated that attackers can learn to defeat keystroke biometrics through training.

Combining multiple types of transparent authentication schemes, as proposed by Riva et al. [26], can enhance overall performance. However, the design of such systems is complex and remains an open research problem.

### IX. Conclusions

ZEBRA is an interesting and useful approach as a zero-effort deauthentication system. We identified a subtle design flaw in ZEBRA, which is easier for human operators to perform and more robust compared to the naive attacks studied by the authors [23]. We demonstrated that a malicious adversary using an opportunistic strategy can defeat ZEBRA. This finding contrasts with the positive results reported in [23], which were based on naive attackers mimicking all victim interactions. Our attack was conducted in a typical usage scenario. While physical mitigations, such as visual barriers, might reduce the success of our specific attack, the underlying vulnerability persists. Although ZEBRA is susceptible to opportunistic adversaries, it performs well against accidental misuse by innocent adversaries, which is likely the most common threat in its intended scenarios. However, systems are often used in contexts not originally envisioned by their designers. Therefore, recognizing the limitations of ZEBRA's original design against malicious adversaries is the first step towards strengthening its resistance. The approaches we identified in Section VI can help secure ZEBRA without losing its desirable properties. We are currently developing these approaches further. More generally, our work highlights how subtle design assumptions based on premature usability and privacy considerations can adversely impact security. We also emphasize the importance of ensuring that adversary models used in security analysis are realistic and do not underestimate attacker capabilities.
