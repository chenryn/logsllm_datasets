### Northern Mariana Islands

**Usage: Intermediate Implementation**

The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) has designated its entire territory as a metropolitan area, comprising a chain of 14 volcanic islands in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. Of these, only three are inhabited: Saipan, Tinian, and Rota. Approximately 90% of the CNMI's population resides on Saipan, which serves as the capital.

**Governance: Intermediate Implementation (10%)**

In 2005, the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) Working Group was established to create the TICP, involving local and state agencies such as public health, state police, and the Port Authority. The area has a mix of formal and informal partnerships among agencies, but formalized agreements are still needed. Although some preliminary planning has begun, CNMI lacks a strategic plan for interoperable communications. Despite facing significant declines in local funding (e.g., the departure of garment companies and a decline in tourism), organizations within CNMI have given some consideration to regional communications interoperability through federal grant funds. The mayor’s participation on the governance committee and the governor's role as the final decision-maker on interoperability decisions indicate that interoperability is a political and fiscal priority.

**Recommendations:**
- Clarify federal membership in the decision-making group (e.g., TICP Working Group) and document roles and responsibilities.
- Develop, document, and formalize agreements (e.g., signed memoranda of understanding [MOUs] with defined roles and responsibilities) among all participating agencies.
- Reference all applicable agreements (e.g., MOUs, intergovernmental agreements) in the TICP and store them in an accessible format.
- Establish a regular review process to ensure that agreements remain current and relevant.
- Develop, document, and implement a regional strategic plan (beyond the operational TICP) with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance, including a long-term communications funding strategy.
- Align local and CNMI-wide strategic planning efforts to ensure regional interoperability needs are met.
- Develop and implement a regional approach to long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) sustainable funding consistent with the strategic plan.
- Continue to champion a governance structure that supports regional communications interoperability, involving senior regional government leadership in long-term funding plans.

**Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Established Implementation (15%)**

The Northern Mariana Islands incorporated existing policies and procedures (e.g., from the Civil Defense Office VHF systems) into the TICP. Since these SOPs were well-established and frequently used, public safety agencies were well-positioned to adopt the TICP. However, the TICP should include updated SOPs related to the new 800 MHz system. The area has begun disseminating these policies and procedures to participating agencies. Due to the limited scope of the exercise, participants did not always demonstrate proficiency in executing all SOPs listed in the TICP. The area began implementing NIMS/ICS less than six months ago, and this was evident during the exercise, as participants did not demonstrate familiarity with command and control processes.

**Recommendations:**
- Continue to distribute updated regional interoperability SOPs (e.g., document demonstrated exercise procedures not originally included in the TICP).
- Develop training policies and requirements for inclusion in the TICP.
- Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises for SOPs (including TICP implementation of communications units) and NIMS/ICS to ensure all participating first responder agencies attain and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance.

**Usage: Intermediate Implementation (10%)**

The CNMI regularly uses its shared 800 MHz system in day-to-day, task force, and mutual aid situations. While proficient in daily use, participants experienced difficulties in demonstrating familiarity and proficiency with interoperable communications equipment during the TICP validation exercise. Although the exercise scope did not require the use of interoperable assets, evaluators noted that when participants attempted to communicate via the shared systems, "no solution was observed to compensate for the significant queuing noted," and cellular and landline telephones were heavily relied upon.

**Recommendations:**
- Regularly test and exercise deployment of and procedures for the territory’s interoperability resources (e.g., radio cache, gateway) to improve proficiency.
- Consider adding interoperable communications as an evaluation component for all future exercises and day-to-day activities.

**Technology Overview**

The CNMI operates an 800 MHz, trunked, Motorola SmartZone™ radio system used by the Department of Public Safety (DPS), Emergency Management Office (EMO), Public Health, Department of Public Works, Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Repeaters are located on Mt. Tapotchao, with consoles and central electronics banks at DPS and EMO. The Ports Authority, Utility Corporation, and Mayor's Office each run their own VHF radio systems. The actual number of cache radios is unknown, and the SmartZone system, now 14 years old, no longer receives parts from Motorola. The need for interoperability is apparent, and newer technology (e.g., T1 or microwave backhaul links) would facilitate this. CNMI aims to replace the system with a Project 25 system but lacks the necessary funding.

### Puerto Rico

**Usage: Intermediate Implementation**

The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (PR) has designated San Juan, the most populous area, as the metropolitan area, consisting of the Bayamón, Guaynabo, and San Juan municipalities.

**Governance: Intermediate Implementation (10%)**

In March 2006, the Puerto Rico Communications Interoperability Committee (PRCIC) was established to develop the TICP for the area. The PRCIC includes municipal, commonwealth, and federal agencies and is dedicated to developing interoperability across the commonwealth. Although there are currently only informal agreements and partnerships among public safety agencies, the area is working toward implementing the formalized TICP and regional SOPs. The area does not base funding and equipment procurement decisions on regionwide interoperable communications goals but is developing a more strategic, long-term funding plan. Despite recent progress, the area lacks a sustained history of dedicated fiscal and political support for interoperable communications.

**Recommendations:**
- Continue to support the decision-making group through regularly scheduled meetings and actively working issues to address regional (tactical and strategic) interoperability.
- Continue to document and formalize agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding) among all participating agencies.
- Continue the interoperability strategic planning process toward the development and implementation of a strategic plan with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance.
- Align regional and territorywide strategic planning efforts to ensure regional communications interoperability needs are met.
- Develop and implement a regional approach to long-term interoperability planning and sustainable funding.
- Incorporate a regional interoperability funding strategy into a strategic plan, considering funding models (in addition to grants) that can leverage regional and territorywide strategic planning efforts.
- Involve additional political leaders in championing a governance structure that fully supports territorywide interoperability.

**Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Intermediate Implementation (10%)**

The TICP is the first regional communications interoperability SOP for the San Juan metropolitan area, and steps have been taken to disseminate the new policies and procedures to all involved organizations. The area has begun implementing the SOPs through tabletop and functional exercises. While still a new process, the area is aggressively working toward full NIMS/ICS implementation, involving fire, EMS, law enforcement, and other public safety support services. During the exercise, participants encountered difficulties following SOPs for command and control, including incomplete ICS Form 205 and multiple participants performing Communications Unit Leader responsibilities.

**Recommendations:**
- Ensure all regional communications interoperability SOPs are in place and put into practice, and increase proficiency in their use.
- Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises for NIMS/ICS (including communications unit training).
- Continue regular practice of NIMS/ICS to improve interoperable communications.

**Usage: Intermediate Implementation (10%)**

The area has the capability to use multiple interoperable communications methods for day-to-day operations but reports infrequent use and flexibility for incident interoperability. During the exercise, participants demonstrated the use of the PREMA gateway, but EMS could not effectively communicate with the Fire Department. The radio cache was not used, and the shared system supported Police and Fire on different talk groups but not as an interoperability method.

**Recommendations:**
- Regularly test and exercise deployment of regional communications interoperability resources to improve proficiency (e.g., shared system, gateway).
- Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.

**Technology Overview**

The Puerto Rico Police Department (PRPD) owns two trunked systems on the island: a Motorola® SmartNet II™ 800 MHz analog trunked system covering San Juan and its vicinity, and an EF Johnson® MultiNet™ 800 MHz analog trunked system covering all other municipalities. Interoperability between the two systems is achieved by a fixed gateway and multi-protocol portable radios. PRPD is the only user of these systems, while most other public safety agencies use VHF and UHF simplex systems. PRPD also owns a large number of fixed and mobile gateways, with plans to interconnect the equipment for remote operation. PREMA is currently acquiring additional gateways.

### U.S. Virgin Islands

**Usage: Intermediate Implementation**

The U.S. Virgin Islands metropolitan area consists of four islands: St. Croix, St. John, St. Thomas, and Water Island.

**Governance: Intermediate Implementation (10%)**

The Virgin Islands Office of Homeland Security established a communications committee to oversee the development and implementation of the TICP. The committee includes local, state, and federal representatives, including administrators from St. Thomas, St. John, and St. Croix. Although the area created regional SOPs and organizations have accepted the plan, it is not yet in practice across the islands. There is a strategic plan addressing funding and operations, but it is unclear if it incorporates interoperable communications beyond the operational focus of the TICP. Limited and fragmented interoperable communications funding plans exist, primarily relying on grants. The area plans to align budget management and equipment procurement with strategic interoperability goals but has not demonstrated a long-term plan. The area’s leaders understand the importance of interoperable communications and are working on further developing political and fiscal support.

**Recommendations:**
- Continue to support the decision-making group through regularly scheduled meetings and actively working issues to address regional (tactical and strategic) interoperability.
- Continue to involve territory and federal organizations in the decision-making group and document roles and responsibilities.
- Document and put into practice the necessary interoperability agreements to ensure consistent communications plans.
- In addition to the TICP, continue to develop and document a strategic plan with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance.
- Involve additional leaders in championing a governance structure that fully supports territorywide interoperability.

**Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Established Implementation (15%)**

The Virgin Islands built on previously existing policies and procedures, including the Emergency Operations Plan, when creating the TICP. The area has disseminated its SOPs to all included organizations and dispatch centers and provided training through the TICP Workshop. During the exercise, participants experienced problems with shared channels and neglected to follow TICP policies and procedures to resolve the issue. The area has been implementing NIMS/ICS for over a year, and fire, EMS, law enforcement, the Red Cross, and the Virgin Islands Rescue Squads are involved in training and implementation. Based on the exercise, the area demonstrated familiarity with NIMS/ICS command and control aspects but experienced deficiencies in full implementation (e.g., incomplete ICS Form 205 and Communications Unit Leader designation confusion).

**Recommendations:**
- Continue to develop, standardize, and put into practice regionwide SOPs for all applicable means of interoperability (e.g., shared channels).
- Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (including communications unit implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure all participating first responder agencies attain and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance.

**Usage: Intermediate Implementation (10%)**

The Virgin Islands has the capability to use shared channels and gateways on a daily basis. Although gateway solutions are frequently used, there is only one equipment manager for the nine gateways across the islands. Officials indicated that interoperable communications were effectively used during a recent real-world event. During the exercise, evaluators observed that practitioners were less familiar with some of their interoperability assets. For example, the participants used the gateway but set it up in a location that could have impeded use. The multidisciplinary use of shared channels and shared systems was minimal, leading to a lack of seamless interoperability. During the exercise, EMS was unable to communicate back to its dispatcher on either the EMS or mutual aid channels once they entered the Water and Power Authority gate.

**Recommendations:**
- Regularly test and exercise deployment of regional interoperability resources (e.g., resolve shared channel and gateway issues involving state and federal agencies) to improve proficiency.
- Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.

**Technology Overview**

Most public safety agencies in the U.S. Virgin Islands use simplex and repeated, conventional VHF systems. There are about 15 mobile gateways between St. Croix, St. John, and St. Thomas, with two shared channels available for interoperability. The Virgin Islands National Guard is transitioning from an 800 MHz system to a VHF system, and the Virgin Islands Office of Homeland Security intends to establish a radio cache in the future.
