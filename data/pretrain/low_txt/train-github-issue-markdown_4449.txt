### Issue: Inconsistent Quotation Mark Usage in HTML and JSX Examples

**Description:**
In many examples, HTML elements use single quotes for attribute values, whereas the README and blog posts from Vercel (formerly Zeit) use double quotes. This inconsistency may confuse users, especially when using linters like `standard`, which enforce double quotes in JSX. It is unclear which style is recommended.

**Steps Taken:**
- I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

**Expected Behavior:**
- Consistent use of quotation marks across all examples, whether in the project or documentation.

**Current Behavior:**
- Mixed styles are used between the examples in the project and the documentation.

**Recommendation:**
- Standardize on either single or double quotes and update all examples to follow this convention.
- Clearly document the chosen style in the contributing guidelines or coding standards.

This will help maintain consistency and reduce confusion for users, particularly when using linters that enforce specific quoting styles.
