#### 26. Setting Up an NFS Share Point
- Use NFS to export share points to UNIX clients. (Export is the NFS term for sharing.)
- **Note:** Avoid using spaces or slashes (/) in the name of a share point you plan to export using NFS. Spaces and slashes in volume names can cause access problems for NFS clients. If you must use spaces, use Netinfo Manager to escape the spaces with a backslash (\).

**To configure an NFS share point:**
1. Open Workgroup Manager and click **Sharing**.
2. Click **Share Points** and select the share point.
3. Click **Protocols** and choose **NFS Export Settings** from the pop-up menu.
4. Select **"Export this item and its contents to"** and choose an audience from the pop-up menu.
   - To limit clients to specific computers, choose **"Client"** and click **Add** to specify the IP addresses of computers that can access the share point.
   - To limit clients to the entire subnet, choose **"Subnet"** and enter the IP address and subnet mask for the subnet.
     - **Important:** Ensure the subnet address corresponds to the subnet mask. Use a network calculator to validate your address/mask combination.
   - To allow unlimited (and unauthenticated) access, choose **"World."**
     - **Note:** Only the last export is available to clients if multiple NFS world exports are created on a single server volume.
5. Select **"Map Root user to nobody"** if you want the root user on a remote client to have minimal privileges.
6. Select **"Map All users to nobody"** if you want all users to have minimal privileges.
7. Select **"Read-only"** if you do not want client users to modify the contents of the shared item.
8. Click **Save**.

**File and file range locking (standard POSIX advisory locks) are enabled by default for NFS share points in Mac OS X Server.**

**From the Command Line:**
- You can also set up an NFS share point by using the `niutil` command in Terminal to add an entry to the NetInfo /exports directory.
- For more information, see the file services chapter of the command-line administration guide.

#### 27. Resharing NFS Mounts as AFP Share Points
- Resharing NFS mounts (NFS volumes exported to the Mac OS X Server) as AFP share points allows clients to access NFS volumes using the secure authentication of an AFP connection. It also enables Mac OS 9 clients to access NFS file services on traditional UNIX networks.
- **Note:** Quotas set on the original NFS export are not enforced on the AFP reshare.

**To reshare an NFS mount as an AFP share point:**
1. On the NFS server, ensure the NFS export maps root-to-root and restrict the export to the single AFP server.
2. On the AFP server, create a directory named `nfs_reshares` at the root level of the file system.
   - In Terminal, log in as admin and use the command: `sudo mkdir /nfs_reshares`
3. Create a subdirectory in the `/nfs_reshares` directory for each NFS volume you want to reshare.
   - In Terminal, use the command: `sudo mkdir /nfs_reshares/`
   - Replace `<volume_name>` with the name of the volume as you want it to appear to AFP clients.
4. On the AFP server, create a mount record that mounts the reshared volume in the `/nfs_reshares` directory.
   - Open NetInfo Manager, select **mounts** in the directory browser window, click the lock, and enter your administrator password.
   - Select **New Subdirectory** from the Directory menu. Edit the name property and add two new properties:
     - `name: <server>:/<path>`
     - `vfstype: nfs`
     - `dir: /nfs_reshares/<volume_name>`
   - Click the lock when finished and save your changes.
5. Restart the computer to enable the mount. Alternatively, manually mount the NFS volume in Terminal with the command: `sudo mount_nfs <server>:<path> /nfs_reshares/<volume_name>`
6. Use the Sharing module in Workgroup Manager to share the NFS mounts as AFP share points. The NFS mounts appear as normal volumes in the All list.
   - You can also share the NFS mounts using SMB and FTP, but it is recommended to use only AFP.
   - You can change privileges and ownership, but not enable quotas (quotas work only on local volumes). However, if quotas are enabled on the NFS server, they should apply to the reshared volume as well.

---

#### 28. Automatically Mounting Share Points for Clients
- You can automatically mount AFP or NFS share points on client computers using network mounts.
- **Note:** All users have guest access to network-mounted AFP share points. Authenticated access is only allowed for a user’s own home directory or if Kerberos is set up to support single sign-on.

**To set up a network mount:**
1. Open Workgroup Manager and click **Sharing**.
2. Click **Share Points** and select the share point.
3. Click **Network Mount**.
4. Choose the directory domain that contains your users and computers from the **Where** pop-up menu.
   - If the correct directory is already chosen, click the lock to authenticate.
5. Choose the sharing protocol (AFP or NFS) from the **Protocol** pop-up menu.
6. Choose how you want the share point to be used and mounted on client computers:
   - **User Home Directories:** The home directories on the share point are listed on a user’s computer in `/Network/Servers`.
   - **Shared Applications:** The share point appears on the user’s computer in `/Network/Applications`.
   - **Shared Library:** The share point appears in `/Network/Library`.
   - **Custom mount path:** The share point appears in the directory you specify. Ensure this directory exists on the client computer before mounting.
7. Click **Save**.
