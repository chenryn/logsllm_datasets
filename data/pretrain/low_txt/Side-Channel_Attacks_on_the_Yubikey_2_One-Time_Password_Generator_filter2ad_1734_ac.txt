### 5.2 Key Recovery using EM Traces

Due to the low-pass characteristic mentioned in Section 4, we continued our analysis using electromagnetic (EM) traces, which provide higher resolution. We performed the same attack as described in Section 5.1 on the digitally demodulated EM traces. The resulting correlations after 800 traces for all candidates of the first, second, eighth, and ninth key bytes are shown in Figure 14.

In contrast to power consumption traces, the correlation for the correct key candidate clearly exceeds that of the incorrect candidates after fewer than 1,000 traces. Additionally, the correlation peak is limited to a short duration of approximately 160 ns, corresponding to a clock frequency of about 6.25 MHz. This suggests that the correlation is likely due to one or a few instructions executed by the microcontroller (µC).

We estimated the number of required traces to recover each key byte, similar to the method in Section 5.1. The results are presented in Table 2. Figure 15b in Appendix 6.2 shows the evolution of the maximum correlation used to derive the numbers in Table 2.

As evident in Table 2, a maximum of 500 EM traces is sufficient to fully recover the 128-bit AES key. Considering that approximately 25% of the EM traces are unusable, this translates to an overall requirement of 666 traces. Consequently, only 1 hour of access to the Yubikey 2 is sufficient to recover the key using EM measurements, compared to the 10.5 hours required with power consumption traces.

A trade-off between computation time and the number of traces can also be considered. For instance, an adversary might choose to record only 300 traces, which would leave three key bytes (1, 3, and 14) partially unrecoverable. However, these remaining 24 bits could be determined through an exhaustive search on a standard PC within minutes. In this scenario, the measurement time is reduced to 36 minutes for a total of 400 traces.

### 6 Conclusion

Using a non-invasive side-channel attack, we successfully extracted the full 128-bit AES key stored on a Yubikey 2 with approximately 500 EM traces. The necessary equipment costs less than $3,000 in total. With the AES key, an adversary can generate an arbitrary number of valid one-time passwords (OTPs) and impersonate the legitimate owner if traditional credentials have been obtained, for example, through eavesdropping, phishing, or malware. To acquire the required number of traces, an adversary needs less than one hour of physical access to the Yubikey, making it feasible to carry out the attack during a short period, such as a lunch break.

It is important to note that a standard correlation power analysis (CPA) was sufficient to mount our attack with a small enough number of traces to pose a real-world threat. Therefore, we did not investigate more complex side-channel attack techniques, such as template attacks [6], which, while potentially reducing the number of required traces, come with additional difficulties due to the need for a separate training device [9]. Our approach using CPA proved to be robust and sufficient in this specific case.

The attack leaves no physical traces on the device under test (DUT). The only means of detecting the attack is a relatively high increase in the usage counters, as discussed in Section 2.2. Since the volatile session counter must reach 256 before the non-volatile usage counter is incremented, the EM-based attack only increases the usage counter by two when recording 500 traces. Thus, the attack does not lead to a "suspicious" change in the counter and is very unlikely to be detected in this way.

### 6.1 Countermeasures

To mitigate the consequences of the attack described in this paper, both hardware-level and backend organizational countermeasures should be implemented. As part of the responsible disclosure process, we discussed feasible approaches with the vendor, Yubico.

Firstly, the Yubikey should always be treated as a second factor and never used as the sole means of authentication. Secondly, it should be ensured that no two Yubikeys share the same AES key. Otherwise, obtaining the AES key from one device would compromise all other devices with the same key. Using only the 6-byte private ID mentioned in Section 2.2 to distinguish Yubikeys is not advisable. Additionally, users should be trained to keep their Yubikey with them at all times and report lost or stolen devices immediately so they can be blocked and replaced.

On the hardware and embedded software level of the Yubikey 2, specific countermeasures against side-channel attacks (SCA) can be implemented. Established techniques, such as randomizing the execution order and timing by shuffling the S-boxes and inserting dummy operations [15], can make the attack much more difficult and significantly increase the number of required traces. This, in turn, reduces the threat posed by the attack, as the longer the device is in the hands of the adversary, the more likely it is that the attack will be noticed by the legitimate user. Due to the limitations of the 8-bit microcontroller used in the Yubikey 2, it is unclear whether SCA countermeasures such as masking, which involve higher space and time overhead, can be implemented.

An interesting alternative, especially for high-security applications, is the Yubikey Neo, also produced by Yubico [33]. Instead of a standard microcontroller, the Yubikey Neo employs a Common Criteria certified smartcard controller specifically designed to withstand implementation attacks and thoroughly tested in this regard. In our opinion, to protect sensitive services and data, the double price of $50 compared to $25 for the Yubikey 2 may be a reasonable investment.

### 6.2 Reaction of the Vendor

Upon discovering the security problem, we contacted the vendor, Yubico, before publication. Yubico acknowledged our results and took measures to mitigate the security issues. We examined an updated firmware (version 2.4) and found that our attacks do not apply to this improved version. Several attempts to circumvent the new mechanisms implemented by the vendor were unsuccessful, indicating a significant increase in the DUT's resistance to SCA. This likely rules out low-complexity attacks (in terms of equipment and required time for measurements) as presented in this paper. The following statement summarizes the reaction of the vendor, Yubico:

"Yubico takes security seriously and we welcome analysis of our products, and are happy to engage on a technical basis for the benefit of our customers. While the YubiKey Standard was not intended to resist physical attacks, we aspire to exceed expectations. After being informed about preliminary results, we worked with the research team to implement mitigations. We have incorporated this in our currently manufactured product. We wish to stress that the YubiKey NEO and the YubiKey Standard used in OATH or challenge response mode is not affected. We look forward to continuing work with researchers and improving our products."
