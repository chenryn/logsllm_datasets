**ATT&CK ID:** T1499  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Endpoint Denial of Service

Adversaries may launch Endpoint Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to disrupt or completely block the availability of services to users. These attacks can be carried out by either exhausting the system resources on which the services are hosted or by exploiting vulnerabilities to induce a persistent crash condition. Common targets for such attacks include websites, email services, DNS servers, and web-based applications.

Endpoint DoS attacks have been observed in various contexts, including for political motivations, as a form of hacktivism, or to support other malicious activities. Adversaries may use these attacks to distract from other operations, to extort victims, or to cause general disruption.
