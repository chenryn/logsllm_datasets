**Message from the Conference Coordinator**

On behalf of the Conference Organizing Committee, I extend a warm welcome to all attendees of the 2006 International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN). This conference is recognized as the premier international event dedicated to dependability in computer systems. As our society becomes increasingly reliant on these systems, and the consequences of failures grow more severe, the topics discussed at DSN are more relevant and critical than ever.

As the Conference Coordinator, my primary responsibility is to oversee the overall technical program. This includes coordinating the activities of the organizers responsible for the Dependable Computing and Communication Symposium, the Performance and Dependability Symposium, the student forum, workshops, industry sessions, and fast abstracts. The success of these components is largely due to the hard work and dedication of the individuals leading each area. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Lorenzo Alvisi, Aad Van Moorsel, Christoph Fetzer, Neeraj Suri, Lisa Spainhower, and Saurabh Bagchi, as well as the organizers of the individual workshops. Special thanks go to Lorenzo and Aad, who, as the two Program Committee (PC) chairs, handled paper submissions, reviews, and PC meetings with exceptional diligence and commitment. Their efforts have significantly contributed to the high quality of the technical program.

I am confident that all attendees will find the conference both valuable and engaging. One of the major challenges in organizing such a diverse program is minimizing scheduling conflicts. While I have made every effort to reduce overlapping sessions, some conflicts are inevitable given the wealth of excellent content and the four-track format. I apologize in advance to those who may find multiple concurrent sessions of interest.

Thank you for choosing to attend DSN 2006. I hope you find the technical program and all other aspects of the conference both informative and enjoyable. We look forward to your participation and wish you a pleasant stay in Philadelphia.

Sincerely,

David Taylor  
Conference Coordinator, DSN 2006
