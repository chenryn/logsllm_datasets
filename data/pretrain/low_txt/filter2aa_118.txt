## Agenda
- Standards and Requirements
- Electro-Mechanical Locks
- Critical Infrastructure and Vulnerabilities
- Real World Threats
- Case Studies

## Standards
### Why We Need Standards
- **Purpose:** To establish a common benchmark for security.
- **Measurements:** They evaluate the lock's resistance to various forms of attack.
- **Limitations:** 
  - Limited protocols and few tests.
  - Exclude many "real-world" attacks such as bumping, mechanical bypass, and specialized attack techniques.

## Standard Security Criteria
- **Conventional vs. High Security:**
  - **Threat Criteria:**
    - Forced Entry
    - Covert Entry
    - Key Security
  - **Basis for Evaluation:**
    - Time, Tools, and Training

### Forced Entry
- **Standards:** UL437 and BHMA 156.30
- **Requirements:**
  - Locks must resist forced entry methods.
  - Attack resistance: 5 minutes.
  - Excludes many attack methods.

### Covert Entry Protection
- **Minimum Security Criteria (UL437 and ANSI/BHMA 156.30):**
  - Protects against certain forms of covert entry.
  - Assures minimum resistance to opening (10-15 minutes).
  - Covers picking, decoding, and master key attacks but not bumping.

### Key Security
- **Organizational Protection:**
  - Duplication of keys
  - Keys ordered by code
- **Legal Protection:**
  - Availability of blanks
- **Technical Security:**
  - Not addressed in standards
- **Conclusion:** Standards provide limited security.

## Categories of Locks
- **Conventional Mechanical Locks**
- **High Security Mechanical Locks**
- **Electronic Credentials:**
  - Electro-Mechanical Locks
  - Electronic Locks
  - Wired, Wireless, Data on Card

## Critical Questions
- What is security regarding locks?
- Is it secure enough?
- What does a high-security rating mean?
- The concept of key control and why it’s important.
- Can the lock be compromised, and how difficult is it?
- Real-world threats and methods to compromise locks.

## Conventional Lock Functions
- **Purpose:** Restrict who can enter and prevent or delay unauthorized access.
- **Security Level:** Low to medium.
- **Certification:** Not certified.
- **Vulnerabilities:**
  - Picking, bumping, decoding
  - Impressioning
  - Master key extrapolation
  - Mechanical bypass
  - Failure of key control (duplication, simulation, replication)

### Are Conventional Locks Adequate?
- No tracking of access attempts or frequency.
- Easy to add or duplicate keys.
- Lack of key security.
- No evidence of breach.
- No intelligence in the lock or key.

## Conventional vs. High Security Cylinders
- **Conventional Cylinders:**
  - Easy to pick or bump open.
  - No key control.
  - Limited forced entry resistance.
- **High Security Cylinders:**
  - Comply with UL and BHMA/ANSI standards (UL-437 and BHMA/ANSI 156.30).
  - Higher quality and tolerances.
  - Resistance to forced and covert entry.
  - Better key control.

### High Security: Increased Protection
- **Protection:** High-value targets.
- **Requirements:** Stringent security.
- **Standards:** UL and BHMA/ANSI.
- **Threat Level:** Higher.
- **Criteria:**
  - Attack times and resistance.
  - More difficult to compromise.
  - Higher key control.

### Critical Differences in High Security
- Multiple security layers.
- More than one point of failure.
- Independent and parallel operation of security layers.
- Difficult to bypass each layer.
- Difficult to derive intelligence about a layer.
- Difficult to simulate the action of a key.

## Mechanical Locks: Design Limitations
- Good for one person, one key.
- No key/user tracking.
- Addition or deletion of keys to the system.
- Lost, stolen, or copied keys.
- Manipulation of keys (e.g., Mul-T-Lock and key interchange).

## Electronic Locks: The Security Solution?
### Electro-Mechanical Locks
- Combine mechanical and electronic credentials.
- Two parallel locking systems:
  - Mechanically keyed alike.
  - Mechanically master-keyed.
  - Key bitting assigned to each customer.

### Electronic Access Control Systems
- Mechanical lock designs.
- Electronic credentials (i-button, RFID, SmartCard).
- Security layers:
  - Protocol
  - Mechanical locking system
  - Audit functions
  - Key security

  - Tests and assures compliance.

### Layered Security Approach
- Physical security of fixed assets.
- Beaches: Trace directly to lock and user violations.
- Copying keys.

### Conventional Locks for Airport Protection
- **Inadequacies:**
  - Duplication of keys.
  - No user-auditable information.
  - No scheduling capabilities (time lock).
  - Master key systems: no identification of employees or ability to test the system.
