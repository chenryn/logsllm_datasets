### Issue Description

I am encountering an issue where a URL is denied in `server.js`, and I expect to see the content of the `_error` page instead of the original `post.js` content. However, when I access this URL, the `_error` page content is almost instantly replaced by the content from `post.js`. I would like to understand how to prevent this unexpected behavior.

### Expected Behavior

When visiting `localhost:3000/post` without any additional parameters, the server should display the content of the custom `_error.js` page. This is the standard behavior in Next.js version 3.0.1.

### Current Behavior

The `_error` page is initially loaded, but it is almost immediately re-rendered with the content from `post.js`. This behavior occurs in Next.js version 3.0.2 and later.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Download or clone the repository from [this link](https://github.com/josefkrajkar/custom-express-server).
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Start the development server using the command `npm run dev`.
4. Open your browser and visit `localhost:3000/post`.

### Environment

- **Next.js Version:** 3.0.2
- **Node.js Version:** 8.1.3
- **Operating System:** macOS Sierra 10.12.6
- **Browser:** Google Chrome 61.0.3163.100

### Additional Notes

- I have searched the issues in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
- The issue is specific to versions of Next.js 3.0.2 and later.
