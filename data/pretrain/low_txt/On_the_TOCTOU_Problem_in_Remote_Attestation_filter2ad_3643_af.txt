### Security and Implementation Aspects of Remote Attestation (RA)

#### Software-Based RA
The security of software-based remote attestation (RA) relies on precise timing measurements. This approach is only suitable in environments where the communication delay between the verifier (Vrf) and the prover (Prv) is negligible or constant, such as in communication between peripherals and a host CPU. Consequently, software-based RA is unsuitable for scenarios where RA must be performed over the internet.

#### Hybrid RA
Hybrid RA is particularly well-suited for low-end embedded devices. It provides the same security guarantees as hardware-based RA while minimizing modifications to the underlying microcontroller unit (MCU) hardware. Current hybrid RA techniques [7–10, 14, 52] implement integrity-ensuring functions (e.g., Message Authentication Codes, MAC) in software, with trusted hardware controlling the execution of this software to prevent security violations, such as gadget-based attacks [53] or key leakage. This paper introduces a paradigm shift in hybrid RA by having trusted hardware provide additional context about the Prv's memory state.

#### Temporal Aspects of RA
In addition to Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerabilities, two other temporal aspects are crucial for RA security:
1. **Temporal Consistency**: This ensures that the RA result reflects an instantaneous snapshot of the Prv's attested memory at some point during RA. Without temporal consistency, self-relocating malware can evade detection by copying or erasing itself during the RA process. Temporal consistency can be achieved by enforcing atomic (uninterruptible) execution of the attestation code or by locking the attested memory during RA.
2. **Real-Time Constraints**: For safety-critical and real-time devices, the requirement for atomicity can interfere with the real-time nature of the Prv application. Techniques like SMARM [37] address this issue by using probabilistic malware detection. ERASMUS [12] and SeED [26] use Prv self-measurements to detect transient malware that infects the Prv and leaves before the next RA instance. Atrium [35] deals with physical-hardware adversaries that intercept instructions as they are fetched to the CPU during attestation, referring to this issue as TOCTOU, although it is distinct from the traditional TOCTOU problem.

#### Formal Verification and RA
Formal verification offers a significantly higher level of assurance, providing provable security for protocol specifications and their implementations. Recent efforts have focused on formal verification of security-critical services and systems [23, 54–58]. VRASED [10] realized a formally verified RA architecture for low-end devices. Other formally verified security services, such as remote proofs of software update, memory erasure, and system-wide MCU reset [1], were derived by extending VRASED. APEX [6] builds on VRASED to develop a verified architecture for proofs of remote software execution on low-end devices. RATA also extends VRASED to provide TOCTOU security while maintaining the original verified guarantees. Relying on VRASED allows for rigorous reasoning about RATA design and formal verification of its security properties. The main concepts of RATA are applicable to other hybrid and possibly hardware-based RA architectures, such as [20].

### Conclusions
In this paper, we design, prove the security of, and formally verify two designs (RAT AA and RAT AB) to secure RA against TOCTOU-related attacks, which perform illegal binary modifications on low-end embedded systems between successive RA instances. The RAT AA and RAT AB modules are formally specified and verified using a model-checker and are composed with VRASED, a verified RA architecture. We show that this composition is TOCTOU-secure using a reduction-based cryptographic proof. Our evaluation demonstrates that a TOCTOU-secure design is feasible even for cost-sensitive low-end embedded devices and, in most cases, reduces RA time complexity from linear to constant in the size of the attested memory.
