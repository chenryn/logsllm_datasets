# V2X Infrastructure and Security Threats

## Introduction
- **Entry Point to V2X Systems**: The DSRC (Dedicated Short-Range Communications) interface serves as the entry point to all systems connected to the V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) infrastructure.
- **Traffic Control Manipulation**: Potential vulnerabilities include manipulation of traffic control systems such as traffic lights and bridges, public transportation, tolling, and financial systems.
- **Wireless Access**: Wireless access to the vehicle's control bus can be exploited to transport malware across borders.

## Security Threats
### Passive Threats
- **Trajectory Determination**: Determine the trajectory of vehicles within a certain radius.
- **Monitoring**: A few monitoring stations are sufficient to cover a typical highway.
- **Service Enumeration**: Enumerate services provided by peers and characterize network traffic patterns within regions.
- **Fingerprinting**: Uniquely fingerprint network participants independent of PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) using RF signatures, probe responses, and behavior patterns.
- **Economic Arbitrage**: Perform arbitrage on economic markets based on gathered data.

### Active Threats
- **Denial of Service (DoS) and Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**: Impersonate infrastructure points and manipulate misbehavior reports.
- **Disruption of Traffic**: Disrupt vehicle traffic and target specific platforms or individuals.
- **Economic Warfare**: Manipulate supply and distribution networks.
- **Behavior Manipulation**: Model and manipulate behavior.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Elevate privileges in VANET (Vehicular Ad Hoc Network).
- **Impersonation**: Parade as an emergency vehicle or a moving toll station.
- **PKI Manipulation**: Use ad hoc PKI for application-layer services and assume vehicle control via platooning services.

## Applied Threat Model
- **Network Corruption**: Network traffic can be corrupted over-the-air.
- **Certificate Hijacking**: Ad hoc PKI can allow certificate hijacking.
- **Diagnostic Services**: Diagnostic services in DSRC implementation expose the vehicle control network.
- **Malicious Instructions**: Valid DSRC messages can pass malicious instructions to the infotainment BUS.
- **Fingerprinting**: Fingerprinting is possible regardless of PKI pseudonym schemes.
- **Trust Management**: Trust management services are vulnerable to manipulation, including misbehavior reporting and certificate revocation.
- **Denial of P2P Certificate Distribution**: Denial of peer-to-peer certificate distribution.

## Our Solution: Just Use Linux
- **Platform-Independent V2X Stack**: Integrated into the mainline Linux kernel, requiring no proprietary DSRC hardware or software.
- **Extensibility**: Extensible in a generic Linux environment, currently supporting ath9k.
- **Standards Implementation**: Implements 802.11p, IEEE 1609.3, and IEEE 1609.4 in the Linux networking subsystem.
- **Mainline Kernel Integration**: Leads to immediate global deployment and rapid driver integration.

## SocketV2V: Implementing 802.11p in Linux Kernel
- **Driver Support**: Add support for the ITS 5.825-5.925GHz band and define ITS 5.8-5.9GHz channels.
- **Regulatory Domain**: Modify the local regulatory domain to force the use of a user-specified domain.
- **Frame Filtering**: Enable filtering for 802.11p frames and require the use of a wildcard BSSID.
- **User-Space Utility Modifications**: Add iw commands for joining 5GHz ITS channels using OCB (Outside Context Broadcaster) and definitions for 5/10MHz-width channels.
- **WAVE Implementation**: Functions to pack, parse, and broadcast WAVE (Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments) messages, with full control over fields and operating modes.
- **Netlink Interface**: Netlink socket interface to userspace for managing channel switching.

## Future Pwning of ITS
- **Levels of Exploitation**:
  - **Level 1**: Denial of Service attacks on single-antenna DSRC systems.
  - **Level 2**: DSRC spectrum sweep to enumerate proprietary services.
  - **Level 3**: Impersonate an emergency vehicle.
  - **Level 4**: Become a mobile tollbooth.
  - **Level 1337**: Remotely execute platooning service to assume direct control.

## Additional Forms of Pwning
- **Mass Malware Dissemination**: Spread malware widely.
- **Passive Surveillance**: Conduct surveillance with minimal effort.
- **RF Parameter Extraction**: Extract RF parameters for imaging.
- **System Reverse Engineering**: Reverse engineer system architectures given enough data.
- **Epidemic Propagation Model**: Built-in protocol switching and exfiltration over communication bridges.

## Developing Connected Vehicle Technologies
- **Community Engagement**: Widespread access enables engagement of the security community in standards development.
- **Interact with V2X Infrastructure**: Pressure manufacturers and OEMs to implement functional V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) systems.
- **Experimental Platforms**: Deploy ahead of market for empirical research, including UAS, maritime, orbital, and heavy vehicles.
- **Empirical Research**: Straightforward to wardrive and hook DIY radio (e.g., Pi Zero with 5GHz USB adapter) into CANBUS (for science only).
