## Observations and Analysis
### D-Link DCS-931L IPCAM
- **Password Security:**
  - Changed default password to "123456".
  - Failed to enable the D-Link cloud service.
- **Firmware Vulnerabilities:**
  - CVE-2015-2048: CSRF to hijack authentication.
  - CVE-2015-2049: Unrestricted file upload to execute.
- **Attack Attempts:**
  - Two instances of unauthorized access via port 8080.
  - Possible use of Shodan for reconnaissance.

### Philips Hue
- **Vulnerability References:**
  - Hacking Lightbulbs Hue (Dhanjani, 2013)
  - MeetHue: Getting Started
  - Port 30000 malicious takeover
- **Traffic Analysis:**
  - Hourly traffic and API requests.
  - No attempts to exploit the leaked API key.
  - UDP broadcast using SSDP.

### LIFX
- **Protocol Details:**
  - Discovery protocol: UDP port 56700
