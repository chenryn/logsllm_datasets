### Electron Version
12.0.1

### Operating System
Windows 10 Enterprise, Build Number: 19041

### Architecture
x64

### Last Known Working Electron Version
Not applicable

### Expected Behavior
When I use the `print({ silent: true, printBackground: true })` method to print a PDF, I expect it to print silently using the default print configuration without displaying the print dialog box.

### Actual Behavior
- When using the `print` method with the `silent` and `printBackground` options set to `true`, the printing process gets stuck if the default print option is set to "Print."
- If I change the default print option to "Microsoft Print to PDF," it prints an empty document.
- Using `executeJavaScript('window.print({ silent: true, printBackground: true })')` results in the document being printed, but the process is not silent.
- This issue is specific to PDFs. 
- Upgrading to Electron version 13.0.0 did not resolve the issue; instead, it caused the PDF viewer to stop working, showing only blank pages. As a result, I had to downgrade to version 12.0.1.
- Silent PDF printing is a critical feature, and I have seen other users requesting a solution, but no resolution has been provided yet.
