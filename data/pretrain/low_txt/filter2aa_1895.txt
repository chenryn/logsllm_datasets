## Technologies That Make a City "Smart"

- **Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)**
- **Urban Automation**
- **Public Safety and Emergency Management**
- **Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)**
- **Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN)**

## Limited Citizen Privacy and Risk Management Options

- You don't have to buy an Alexa.
- You can buy a non-smart TV.
- You can use a feature phone or forego a cell phone.
- You can buy an older car.
- Can you move to a city that isn’t “smart”?

## V2I, V2V, OBD-III, and DSRC

- **Connected Vehicles**: Communicate with each other and with city infrastructure during travel.
- **DSRC (Dedicated Short-Range Communications)**: Allows unique identification.
- **OBD-III (On-Board Diagnostics III)**: A more powerful proposed standard.

## Hangzhou “City Brain”

- **Quote**: "In China, people have less concern with privacy, which allows us to move faster."
  - **Source**: Xian-Sheng Hua, Manager of AI at Alibaba, World Summit AI, 2017

## Smart Streetlights with Cameras

- **GE’s Bill Ruh**: Each city should set policies around the data collected by sensors and how it can be used.

## Facial Recognition

- **Singapore**: In 2017, Peter Ong, former head of Singapore’s civil service, announced plans to deploy facial recognition technology to all 110,000 lampposts in the country.

## Dubai Robotic Police Force

- **Quote**: "By 2030, we will have the first smart police station which won’t require human employees."
  - **Source**: Brigadier Khalid Nasser Al Razouqi, General Director of the Smart Services Department, Dubai Police

## Reconnaissance

### Traditional Port Scanning
- **Tools**:
  - IANA assigned ranges
  - masscan, unicornscan
  - Internet scan projects (e.g., SHODAN, Censys)

### Physical Reconnaissance
- **Methods**:
  - Visual observation
  - Wireless reconnaissance (WiFi, 900MHz one-offs, Zigbee, LoRaWAN)
  - Log off and go outside for on-site inspection

### Search Engines
- **Techniques**:
  - City contracts are public by law. Example search: `Google: "purchase order" "smart device" site:gov`
  - Available on the Internet
  - Customer case studies

### Open Source Application Development Portal (OSADP)
- **Case Study**: Austin, TX

## Devices and Vulnerabilities
