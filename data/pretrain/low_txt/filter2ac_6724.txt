**ATT&CK Technique Name:** DNS Server

Adversaries may establish and operate their own Domain Name System (DNS) servers to support their malicious activities. These custom DNS servers can be used during both the initial targeting phase and post-compromise operations. During the post-compromise phase, adversaries may leverage DNS traffic for various tasks, such as Command and Control (C2) communications, often by using application layer protocols.

Instead of compromising or hijacking existing DNS servers, adversaries may choose to set up and manage their own DNS infrastructure. This approach provides them with greater control and flexibility, enabling them to conduct their operations more effectively and with a reduced risk of detection.
