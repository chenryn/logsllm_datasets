### Usability and Playfulness Scores

Scores above 70 are indicative of good overall usability. The playfulness of the challenges was rated at 3.36 (standard deviation = 1.40), while the easiness of the challenges was rated at 4.58 (standard deviation = 0.77). This suggests that participants found the game challenges to be very easy, although not necessarily playful. These results bode well for the user experience of Gametrics.

### Application Scenarios

**Authentication Mechanism:**
Gametrics can be utilized as a point-of-entry mechanism, such as authenticating users to a web server. 

**Integration with Graphical Passwords:**
Graphical passwords are based on the psychological principle that the human brain has superior memory for processing visual information compared to textual information [3, 30]. They can be based on recognition, such as Random Arts images [23], PassObjects [34], and PassFaces [22], or on recall, such as drawings [8, 14] and PassPoints [33]. Gametrics can be integrated with graphical passwords as a second factor authentication, enhancing security against shoulder surfing and spoofing attacks. Further work is needed to realize such two-factor designs.

**Fallback Authentication:**
Gametrics can also serve as a fallback authentication mechanism. In this use case, multiple instances of the challenges can be presented to the user, as fallbacks do not occur frequently. However, to maintain an up-to-date classification model, the system may need to periodically ask the user to solve challenges. Future investigation is necessary to study Gametrics in the context of fallback authentication applications.

**Touchscreen Devices:**
Given the popularity of touchscreen games, Gametrics would fit well on touchscreen devices. Here, Gametrics can utilize various sensors, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes, to measure users' implicit interactions. Combining these with explicit touchscreen interaction features may enhance overall classification accuracy and resistance to attacks. Future work will study the effectiveness of Gametrics for authenticating users on such devices.

**Trust API Integration:**
Recently, Google announced plans to eliminate passwords by introducing a Trust API that uses a fusion of multiple biometric indicators, such as face recognition, voice patterns, and gait biometrics [13]. In the future, we hope that Gametrics can be added to the Trust API by asking users to play a game challenge on a periodic basis.

### Limitations

Like other behavioral biometrics, Gametrics may suffer from a degradation in the accuracy of user identification when the user's behavior undergoes significant variation, such as changing emotions [9], falling sick, or getting injured. The effect of behavioral changes on Gametrics' performance should be subject to future work.

Future work may also need to test the accuracy of Gametrics classification models when switching devices or hardware (e.g., different kinds of mice or screens).

The results from our study are promising, but further work is needed to improve the overall accuracy of user identification. One avenue is to add more complexity to the game challenges to increase the level of interaction between the challenge and the user, thereby improving the overall usability (False Negative Rate) and security (False Positive Rate) of the interactive authentication.

### Related Work

**Behavioral Biometrics:**
The main aim of behavioral biometrics is to address the problems associated with traditional authentication systems, such as password leakage or sharing, and the requirement for extra hardware in traditional biometrics (e.g., fingerprint readers or iris scanners). However, most proposed behavioral biometrics suffer from issues like low uniqueness among users, leading to high false positive rates. Some require long interaction times, which can allow attackers to interact with the system undetected.

**Keystroke Analysis and Mouse Dynamics:**
The most studied approaches for behavioral biometrics are keystroke analysis and mouse dynamics. Keystroke biometrics identifies users based on their typing characteristics, using features such as key down/hold/up events, time between key releases, typing speed, and error frequency [36]. Mouse dynamics [35] is another widely studied method, used for continuous authentication by recording user interactions transparently.

**Cognitive Abilities:**
Recent research has explored user authentication based on cognitive abilities [1]. In this work, the authors studied the ability to authenticate users based on their cognitive processes, captured through visual search, working memory, and priming effects. The game they used provided a challenge-response task, where users had to drag an object onto a matching object in a search set. Although the method achieved high accuracy (0-7.8% FNR and 0-2.3% FPR), the verification and enrollment times were much longer than those of Gametrics (76.7 seconds - 2.5 minutes for verification and 9.8 min - 24.3 min for enrollment).

**Game-Play Activity Patterns:**
In [5], the authors proposed identifying users based on their game-play activities, showing that idle time distribution is a representative feature. Their relative entropy test (RET) scheme, based on Kullback-Leibler divergence, achieved over 90% accuracy with a 20-minute detection time given a 200-minute history size. However, their detection time is much higher than that of Gametrics.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we introduced Gametrics, an interactive biometrics system based on gameplay patterns embedded in simple game constructs. We demonstrated that incorporating mouse dynamics with cognitive mechanisms can identify users with high accuracy within a short period. Gametrics provides security against various vulnerabilities, including zero-effort attacks and expert attacks. The enrollment and authentication times are reasonably short, and the system provides a good user experience, as reflected in participant responses.
