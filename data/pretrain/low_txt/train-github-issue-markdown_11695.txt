While investigating issue #1411, I tested the `class_weight` parameter in several estimators and observed that it does not function as expected in the `RidgeClassifier`.

I suspect this may be due to a misunderstanding on my part or a regularization issue. Specifically, when dealing with noisy labels, I would expect the `class_weight` parameter to allow me to adjust the decision boundary. However, this is not the case, as demonstrated in the attached notebook.

Any insights or feedback would be greatly appreciated.
