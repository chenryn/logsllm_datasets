### 2. Technical Overview

#### 2.1 Progressive Group Signatures

When examining the most compact CCA2-fully anonymous group signatures in the standard model under standard assumptions (SXDH and XDLIN) by Libert et al. [LPY15], the signature sizes in the best case will have 30 G1 and 14 G2 elements (approximately 15,000 bits when using the settings in Table 1). These signatures come with large public keys and computation times that are far from being feasible for resource-constrained devices.

#### 2.2 Performance of Signature Generation

Our CPA-fully anonymous instantiation is the fastest among all schemes used for comparison, even among those providing CCA− anonymity. To the best of our knowledge, it is the fastest among all existing schemes. This is particularly important because signature generation is likely to be executed on a constrained device. For signature verification, our CPA-fully anonymous instantiation is only outperformed by the CCA− anonymous instantiation in [PS16].

#### 2.3 Signature Size

Comparing schemes with the same anonymity guarantees, our CPA-fully anonymous instantiation provides shorter signature sizes than the popular BBS scheme [BBS04] and, to the best of our knowledge, the shortest signature sizes among all CPA-fully anonymous schemes. Regarding CCA2-fully anonymous schemes, it appears that the efficiency gained in the "without explicit encryption" paradigm comes at the cost of larger signatures compared to instantiations following the SEP paradigm.

### 3. Implementation Results

To confirm the relative performance advantage of our scheme as presented in Table 1 (where we present estimations on a smart card-like device using the performance figures from [UW14]), we benchmarked actual Java implementations of the scheme in [DP06] and our CCA2-fully anonymous scheme using the JMH benchmarking framework and the BN-pairing implementation of the ECCelerate library. The benchmarks were run on an Intel Core i7-4790 CPU with 16 GB RAM running Ubuntu 17.04. On such a powerful platform, signature generation and verification are much faster (not even noticeable). However, it still gives us insight into the accuracy of our estimations regarding the relative computational costs of the schemes.

We compare the absolute numbers of possible signing operations per second (i.e., the throughput) for both schemes. Our results show that our scheme allows twice as many signature generations per second as [DP06] (34,589 ops/s vs. 17,067 ops/s), indicating that our relative performance advantage is even slightly better than suggested by the estimations. When increasing the bitlength of p, our scheme becomes more favorable compared to all other schemes, mainly due to the fact that we do not require operations in the computationally expensive target group GT. For example, when switching from 100-bit security (the current estimate for 256-bit BN-curves [BD18]) to 128-bit security (i.e., 462-bit BN-curves [BD18]), we can compute approximately 2.5 times more signatures than [DP06].

### 4. Conclusion

In this paper, we further pushed the efficiency limits of CPA- as well as CCA2-fully anonymous group signature schemes with respect to signature generation and verification. We also achieved smaller signature sizes for CPA-fully anonymous group signature schemes. Our construction is the only one that does not require any pairing computations or computations in the target group GT upon signature creation, making it especially suitable for constrained devices.

It is also noteworthy that the dynamic Join in [DP06] (and also for [BBS04] when turning it into a dynamic scheme) requires an extractable commitment to a discrete logarithm, which renders their Join procedure rather inefficient. The suggestion in [DP06] is to use Paillier encryption, which, besides adding an additional hardness assumption (DCR) in the hidden order group (factoring-based) setting, induces a significant performance penalty due to an additional expensive equality proof of discrete logarithms in two different groups (see, e.g., [CM99]). In contrast, our scheme achieves this without any such performance penalty and without additionally requiring the hidden-order setting.

Finally, our results affirmatively answer the theoretical question of whether CPA- as well as CCA2-fully anonymous schemes following the "without explicit encryption" paradigm are possible. Recently, Fuchsbauer and Gay [FG18] proposed a variant of SPS-EQ with a relaxed unforgeability notion under standard assumptions, i.e., Matrix-Diffie-Hellman assumptions. They show that their scheme can be plugged into the group signature construction in this paper. However, relying on standard assumptions comes at the cost of decreased performance, making the resulting scheme less attractive regarding efficiency.

### 7. Plausibility of co-CDHI

To justify that co-CDHI is a plausible assumption, we state the following additional assumption in the Type-3 bilinear group setting, which falls into the Uber assumption family [Boy08] with \( R = \langle 1, 1/b \rangle \), \( S = \langle 1, b \rangle \), \( T = \langle 1 \rangle \), and \( f = b^2 \).

**Definition 28.** Relative to BGGen, for all PPT adversaries \( A \) there exists a negligible function \( \epsilon(\cdot) \) such that:
\[
\Pr \left[ \begin{array}{l}
BG \leftarrow BGGen(1^\kappa), \\
b \leftarrow_R \mathbb{Z}_p, \\
c \leftarrow A(BG, 1/bP, b\hat{P}) : \\
c = e(P, \hat{P})^{b^2}
\end{array} \right] \leq \epsilon(\kappa).
\]

**Lemma 3.** If the assumption in Definition 28 holds, then the co-CDHI assumption also holds.

**Proof.** Assume a co-CDHI adversary \( B \). We obtain a problem instance \( 1/bP, b\hat{P} \) relative to \( BG \) for the problem underlying the assumption in Definition 28, start \( B(BG, 1/bP, b\hat{P}) \) to obtain \( c = bP \), and output \( e(P, \hat{P})^{b^2} \leftarrow e(c, b\hat{P}) \) with the same probability as \( B \) outputs \( bP \), i.e., breaks co-CDHI.
