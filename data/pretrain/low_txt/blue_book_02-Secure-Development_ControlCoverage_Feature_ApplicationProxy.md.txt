### Security Controls for Azure AD Application Proxy

| Description & Rationale | Control | Severity | Automated Fix Script |
|-------------------------|---------|----------|----------------------|
| **Only security-compliant applications should be onboarded to AAD App Proxy.** <br> AAD App Proxy facilitates remote access to on-premises applications. If these applications are not designed and implemented securely, their security issues may be exposed to the internet. | Only security-compliant apps should be onboarded to AAD App Proxy. | High | No | No |
| **AAD Authentication must be enabled as a pre-authentication method on your app.** <br> Pre-authentication blocks a significant number of anonymous attacks by allowing only authenticated identities to access the back-end application. | AAD Authentication must be enabled as a pre-authentication method. | High | No | No |
| **Delete personal data captured in logs on the connector machine periodically, or turn off logging if not required.** <br> Connector machine logs may contain personal data, which needs to be handled with care and purged when not needed, in keeping with good privacy principles. | Delete personal data in logs or turn off logging. | High | No | No |
| **HTTP-Only cookie must be enabled while configuring App Proxy wherever possible.** <br> Using an HTTP-Only cookie protects against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by disallowing cookie access to client-side scripts. | HTTP-Only cookie must be enabled. | High | No | No |
| **Use a security-hardened, locked-down OS image for the connector machine.** <br> The connector machine serves as a 'gateway' into the corporate environment, allowing internet-based client endpoints access to enterprise data. Using a locked-down, secure baseline configuration ensures that this machine does not become an entry point for attacks on the applications or corporate network. | Use a security-hardened, locked-down OS image for the connector machine. | High | No | No |

By adhering to these controls, you can enhance the security of your Azure AD Application Proxy and protect your on-premises applications from potential threats.
