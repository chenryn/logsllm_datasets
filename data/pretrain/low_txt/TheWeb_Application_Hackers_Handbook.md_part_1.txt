### Acknowledgments

We are indebted to the directors and others at Next Generation Security Software, who provided the right environment for us to realize the first edition of this book. Since then, our input has come from an increasingly wider community of researchers and professionals who have shared their ideas and contributed to the collective understanding of web application security issues that exists today. Because this is a practical handbook rather than a work of scholarship, we have deliberately avoided filling it with a thousand citations of influential articles, books, and blog postings that spawned the ideas involved. We hope that people whose work we discuss anonymously are content with the general credit given here.

We are grateful to the people at Wiley—especially to Carol Long for enthusiastically supporting our project from the outset, to Adaobi Obi Tulton for helping polish our manuscript and coaching us in the quirks of “American English,” to Gayle Johnson for her very helpful and attentive copy editing, and to Katie Wisor’s team for delivering a first-rate production.

A large measure of thanks is due to our respective partners, Becky and Amanda, for tolerating the significant distraction and time involved in producing a book of this size.

Both authors are indebted to the people who led us into our unusual line of work. Dafydd would like to thank Martin Law, a great guy who first taught him how to hack and encouraged him to spend his time developing techniques and tools for attacking applications. Marcus would like to thank his parents for everything they have done and continue to do, including getting him into computers. He has been getting into computers ever since.
