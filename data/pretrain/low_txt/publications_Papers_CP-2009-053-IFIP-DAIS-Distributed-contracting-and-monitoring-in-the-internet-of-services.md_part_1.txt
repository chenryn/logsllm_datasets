**Abstract:**
The recent approval of the EU Services Directive is fostering the development of the Internet of Services (IoS) and promoting the emergence of marketplaces for business and real-world services. From a research perspective, the IoS will require new technological infrastructures to support business service descriptions, contract management from various perspectives, end-to-end marketplaces, and business monitoring. The IoS envisions web service-based digital societies where service hosting moves from best-effort provisioning to guaranteed service delivery. In this context, monitoring becomes a crucial point of proof for both providers and consumers. This paper presents the integration of technical monitoring results into business effects based on the distributed service infrastructure developed in the THESEUS project, specifically in the TEXO use case.

**1. Introduction**

The rise of electronic marketplaces for services necessitates the description of services not only at the technical level but also from business and operational perspectives. Service-oriented Architectures (SOA) and web services leverage the technical value of solutions in distributed systems, cross-enterprise integration, and enterprise architectures. While SOA and web services reside in an IT layer, organizations require the advertising and trading of business services that reside in a business layer. Existing solutions for Service Level Agreement (SLA) negotiation and monitoring need to be adapted to provide suitable infrastructures for monitoring business aspects.

The European directive on services in the internal market [1] facilitates businesses in providing and using cross-border services within the EU. It strengthens consumer rights, such as non-discrimination and contract fulfillment protection. In a business context, a service is the non-material equivalent of a good, provided by a service provider to a service consumer to create value for both parties.

Real-world examples of domains requiring the digital description and monitoring of business services and the establishment of contracts include the software and automobile industries. In these use cases, both providers and consumers face the challenge of describing service offerings, which is significant given that services are one of the least understood portions of the global economy [2,3].

This paper is structured as follows:
- **Chapter 2:** Presents the Universal Service Description Language (USDL) for describing business services and the creation of SLA templates from USDL service descriptions.
- **Chapter 3:** Introduces our monitoring architecture and illustrates different aspects of monitoring.
- **Chapter 4:** Shows how monitoring data can be aggregated and used to evaluate SLA.
- **Chapter 5:** Describes how discovered problems can be handled.

**2. Descriptions of Services and Service Level Agreements**

**2.1 Business Service Descriptions**

Service descriptions are fundamental for enabling the offering, search, and usage of services. SLAs are formal contracts between a service provider and consumer, regulating the provisioning and consumption of services. In this section, we argue for the need for suitable means to describe services and present USDL as our approach. We will also show how SLAs are created from USDL descriptions.

**2.1.1 The Vision of the Internet of Services (IoS)**

The vision of the IoS [4] and service marketplaces represents a new business model that can radically change the way we discover and invoke services. Developing infrastructures to maintain electronic marketplaces for services requires support for the contracting and monitoring of business aspects of services. In the IoS, services are seen as tradable goods offered on service marketplaces by providers to potential consumers. Barros et al. [5] describe service marketplaces as logical collections of services subject to constraints characteristic of business service delivery. Multiple providers may offer their services, creating an ecosystem of competing and collaborating services. The notion of a business service is broader than the concept of a web service, which primarily has an IT perspective. Web services are technical software resources that are discoverable, invocable, platform-independent, and self-descriptive [6]. They are described by interface definitions (e.g., WSDL) and monitored at the technical and infrastructure levels. In contrast, the IoS requires a stronger emphasis on a business perspective. A suitable service description must account for legal constraints, resources consumed and produced, service scope and purpose, consumer benefits, pricing strategies, participating roles and responsibilities, service levels, operations, distribution channels, and marketing efforts.

**2.1.2 Beyond WSDL: The Need for USDL**

While WSDL describes the technical details of web services, the IoS requires combining and correlating business, operational, and technical aspects into service descriptions. USDL, the Universal Service Description Language, addresses this need by integrating business, operational, and technical perspectives. The business cluster in USDL describes information about the service provider and relevant consumers, including service levels, legal terms, marketing, and interaction. The operational cluster describes the functions and functional classification of a service, supporting service search. The technical perspective allows the specification of technical communication aspects using WS-* protocols. By defining these three clusters, USDL goes beyond purely technical approaches like WSDL and provides a well-understood and limited set of options for describing the most important aspects of business services.

**2.1.3 Example: Logistics Service Description**

Listing 1.1 presents a simplified example of a USDL business description for a logistics service. The Truck Freight Transport Service enables the transport of goods within the city limits of Dresden, with an execution time of 3 hours and a reliability of 95%.

1 service {
2   serviceName TruckFreightTransportService
3   description Transport of goods within city area
4   business {
5     providerName Truck Transport Dresden GmbH
6     providerAddress Traubestr 17, Dresden, Germany
7     price 100 EUR
8     termsOfUse http://www.truck-dd.com/services/ToU.html
9     executionTime 3H
10    reliability 95%
11  }
}
```

**2.2 Deriving SLA from Service Descriptions**

In the IoS, SLAs provide a formal base for regulating the provisioning and consumption of services between the provider and consumer. These contracts are monitored to ensure conformance to the agreement by both parties. Violations of service level objectives (SLOs) need to be identified, and appropriate reactions triggered.

Various technologies have been developed for negotiating and representing formal contracts, such as WSLA [13], SLAng [14], and WS-Agreement [15]. For our project, we chose to implement SLA handling based on WS-Agreement, augmented with information from our USDL specification. The creation of SLAs was integrated into our service development process, and an SLA Manager component was developed to handle SLA negotiation and make SLA information available to other components.

**2.2.1 Specifying SLA**

The SLA negotiation process, following the WS-Agreement protocol, starts with an SLA template generated from the service description at the end of the service development process. During negotiation, this template is refined into an agreement proposal and finally into an agreement. The WS-Agreement files are structured into three main sections: ServiceDescriptionTerms, ServiceProperties, and GuaranteeTerms. The ServiceDescriptionTerm section describes general information about the service and its functionality. The ServiceProperties section defines measurable service attributes, and the GuaranteeTerm section defines SLOs, such as minimum, maximum, average, or concrete values, for the variables defined in the ServiceProperties section.

Listing 1.2 shows a simplified SLA example for the Truck Freight Transport Service, incorporating USDL elements.

2   Name TruckFreightTransportService SLA
3   ServiceDescriptionTerm {
4     ServiceName TruckFreightTransportService
5     usdl:description Transport of goods within city area

19   GuaranteeTerm {

27     ServiceLevelObjective {

31   }
}
```

**Figure 2** provides an overview of the SLA generation, negotiation, and monitoring processes as implemented in our work. Services are created using the Inter-enterprise Service Engineering (ISE) workbench, which implements a model-driven approach to service development. As the final step of the development process, SLA templates are generated from the USDL service description. The parameters specified for the service are mapped to the different WS-Agreement elements of the SLA template document or the USDL elements.
