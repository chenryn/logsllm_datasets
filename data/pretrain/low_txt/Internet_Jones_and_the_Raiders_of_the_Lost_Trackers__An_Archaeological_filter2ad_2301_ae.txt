### Table 5: Tracker with the Most API Calls on a Single Site per Year

Table 5 identifies the tracker that makes the most API calls on a single site in each year. In cases of ties, the third-party tracker that appears on the largest number of sites is selected. The maximum usage of APIs has increased over time. However, we observe that the most prolific API users are not necessarily the most popular cookie-based trackers.

Although our analysis only identifies API uses within JavaScript and does not account for how the results are used, the increasing use of these APIs implies an enhanced ability to fingerprint users. This is particularly true when combined with non-JavaScript signals such as HTTP headers and plugin behavior. For example, Panopticlick derived 18 bits of entropy about remote browsers from a subset of these APIs, along with HTTP headers and information from plugins [15].

### Increasing Power of Fingerprint-Related API Users

Beyond the growing power of the most prolific fingerprint-related API users, we also find that more sites include more trackers using these APIs over time. Figure 5 illustrates the number of sites in each year containing a tracker that calls at least K of the 37 fingerprinting APIs on that site. While many sites have always included trackers that use at least one API (typically `navigator.userAgent`, which is common in browser compatibility checks), the number of sites with trackers calling two or more APIs has risen significantly over time.

### Use of HTML5 Local Storage

In addition to fingerprint-related APIs, we examine the use of HTML5 `localStorage`, a per-site persistent storage mechanism standardized in 2009. Figure 6 shows that the use of `localStorage` has risen rapidly since its introduction, indicating that tracking defenses should increasingly consider storage mechanisms beyond cookies.

### Third-Party Contacts

We now turn our attention to the number of third parties that users encounter while browsing the web. Even third parties not confirmed as trackers have the potential to track users across the web. As discovered in Section 4, many third parties in archived data may indeed be confirmed trackers for which the Wayback Machine simply did not archive sufficient information.

Figure 7 shows the distribution of third-party requests for the top 500 sites from 1996 to 2016. The increase in both medians and distributions indicates that more third parties are being contacted by popular sites, both in common and extreme cases.

Figure 8 provides a different view of similar data, showing the distribution of the top sites each year by the number of distinct third parties they contact. In the early 2000s, only about 5% of sites contacted at least five third parties, while in 2016, nearly 40% of sites did so. We see a maximum in 2015, when one site contacted 34 separate third parties (a raw number likely underestimated by the Wayback Machine’s data).

### Top Trackers Over Time

Next, we investigate the top trackers each year: who are the key players in the ecosystem, and how wide is their view of users' browsing behaviors?

#### Coverage of Top Trackers

We define the coverage of a set of trackers as the percentage of total sites from the dataset for which at least one of those trackers appears. For a single tracker, its coverage is the percentage of sites on which it appears. Intuitively, coverage suggests the concentration of tracking ability—greater coverage allows trackers to build larger browsing profiles. This metric addresses the core privacy concern of tracking, that certain entities may know nearly everything a person does on the web.

We consider trackers by domain name, even though some trackers are owned by the same company (e.g., Google owns `google-analytics.com`, `doubleclick.net`, and the “+1” button served from `google.com`), because a business relationship does not imply that the entities share data, though some trackers may indeed share information out of public view.

Figure 9 illustrates the growth of tracker coverage over time. It considers both the single domain with the highest coverage each year (Top 1 Tracker) and the combined coverage of the union of the top 5, 10, and 20 trackers. Confirming the lesson from Section 4.2, the coverage rates we see for third-party domains in the archive are similar to live coverage of confirmed vanilla cookie-based trackers. Clearly, the coverage of top trackers has risen over time, suggesting that a small number of third parties can observe an increasing portion of user browsing histories.

#### Popular Trackers Over Time

Who are these top trackers? Figure 10 shows the rise and fall of the top two trackers ("champions") each year. To create this figure, we manually label known popular confirmed trackers. We identified the two domains with the highest third-party request coverage each year, omitting cases where the most popular tracker in a year appeared on only one site. We manually verified that 12/19 of these domains were indeed trackers by researching the domain, owning company, archived behavior and context, and modern behaviors (if applicable).

Based on this analysis, we can assess the change in tracking behaviors even for domains for which cookies are lost in the archive (e.g., `doubleclick.net`). This analysis reveals trends in the trackers with the most power to capture profiles of user behavior across many sites. We find that in the early 2000s, no single tracker was present on more than 10% of top sites, but in recent years, `google-analytics.com` has been present on nearly a third of top sites, and 2-4 others have been present on more than 10% and growing.

Some, such as `doubleclick.net` (acquired by Google in 2008), have been popular throughout the entire time period of the graph, while others, such as `scorecardresearch.com`, have seen a much more recent rise. We note that `google-analytics.com` is a remarkable outlier with nearly 35% coverage in 2011. Google Analytics is also an outlier in that it is one of only two non-cross-site trackers among the champions (`gstatic.com`, a Referred Analytics tracker, is the other). As an Analytics-type tracker, Google Analytics tracks users only within a single site, meaning that its "coverage" is arguably less meaningful than that of a cross-site tracker. However, we observe that Google Analytics could track users across sites via fingerprinting or by changing its behavior to store tracking cookies. This observation highlights the need for repeated measurements studies that provide transparency on the web: with a simple change to its tracking infrastructure, Google Analytics could begin to track users across 40% of the most popular sites on the web overnight. Thus, Google's decision not to structure Google Analytics in this way has a tremendous impact on user privacy.

### Evolution of the Tracking Ecosystem

Finally, we consider the tracking ecosystem as a whole, focusing on relationships between different trackers. We find a remarkable increase in the complexity of these relationships over time. We only consider relationships observable using TrackingExcavator, not external information about business relationships.

To study these relationships, we construct the graph of referring relationships between elements on pages. For example, if we observe a third-party request from `example.com` to `tracker.com`, or from `tracker.com` referring to `tracker2.com`, the nodes for those domains in the graph will be connected by edges. We find a significant increase in complexity over time by examining several properties of this graph (Figure 11). Over time, the mean number of referrals outward from domains increases (top of Figure 11), while the number of domains that are never referred to by other domains or never refer outward steadily decreases (middle of Figure 11). Meanwhile, the maximum number of domains that refer to a single domain increases dramatically, suggesting that individual third parties in the web ecosystem have gradually gained increasing prominence and coverage. This reflects and confirms trends shown by other aspects of our data (Figures 10 and 9).

These trends illuminate an ecosystem of generally increasing connected relationships and players growing in size and influence. Appendix B shows this evolution in graph form; the increase in complexity over time is quite striking.

### Summary and Discussion

We have uncovered trends suggesting that tracking has become more prevalent and complex in the 20 years since 1996: there are now more unique trackers exhibiting more types of behaviors; websites contact increasing numbers of third parties, giving them the opportunity to track users; the scope of top trackers has increased, providing them with a broader view of user browsing behaviors; and the complexity and interconnectedness of the tracking ecosystem have increased markedly.

From a privacy perspective, our findings show that over time, more third parties are in a position to gather and utilize increasing amounts of information about users and their browsing behaviors. This increase comes despite recent academic, policy, and media attention on these privacy concerns, suggesting that these discussions are far from resolved. As researchers continue to conduct longitudinal measurements of web tracking going forward, our work provides the necessary historical context in which to situate future developments.

### Additional Related Work

**Tracking and Defenses:** Third-party tracking has been studied extensively in recent years, particularly through analysis and measurements from 2005 to the present [18, 19, 24, 30, 32–34, 40–43, 60]. A few studies have considered mobile, rather than desktop, browser tracking [20, 27]. Beyond explicit stateful (e.g., cookie-based) tracking, recent work has studied the use of browser and machine fingerprinting techniques to re-identify and track users [3, 4, 15, 37, 57, 71]. Others have studied the possible results of tracking, including targeted ads [45, 70], personalized search [29], and price discrimination [66].

User-facing defenses against tracking range from browser extensions like Ghostery [23] and Privacy Badger [16] to research proposals (e.g., [8, 28]). Researchers have also designed privacy-preserving alternatives, including privacy-preserving ads [22, 25, 59, 64], social media widgets [14, 39, 61], and analytics [6]. Others have studied user attitudes toward tracking and targeted advertising (e.g., [46, 51, 65]).

Our study shows the increased prevalence of tracking over time, suggesting that designing and supporting these defenses for privacy-sensitive users is as important as ever.

**Wayback Machine and Other Longitudinal Measurements:** Others have used the Wayback Machine for historical measurements to predict whether websites will become malicious [62] and to study JavaScript inclusion [55] and website accessibility [26]; to recover medical references [67]; to analyze social trends [35]; and as evidence in legal cases [17]. Others [53] found that websites are accurately reflected in the archive. These studies noted similar limitations as we did, as well as ways it has changed over time [38]. Finally, researchers have studied other aspects of the web and Internet longitudinally without the use of archives, including IPv6 adoption [12], search-engine poisoning [47], privacy notices [52], and botnets [68].

### Conclusion

Though third-party web tracking and its associated privacy concerns have received attention in recent years, the practice long predates the first academic measurement studies of tracking (begun in 2005). Indeed, in our measurements, we find tracking behaviors as early as 1996. We introduce TrackingExcavator, a measurement infrastructure for third-party web tracking behaviors that leverages archive.org’s Wayback Machine to conduct historical studies. We rigorously evaluate the Wayback Machine’s view of past third-party requests and develop strategies for overcoming its limitations.

We then use TrackingExcavator to conduct the most extensive longitudinal study of the third-party web tracking ecosystem to date, retrospectively from 1996 to the present (2016). We find that the web tracking ecosystem has expanded in scope and complexity over time: today’s users browsing the web’s popular sites encounter more trackers, with more complex behaviors, with wider coverage, and with more connections to other trackers, than at any point in the past 20 years. We argue that understanding the trends in the web tracking ecosystem over time—provided for the first time at this scale by our work—is important to future discussions surrounding web tracking, both technical and political.

Beyond web tracking, there are many questions about the history and evolution of the web. We believe our evaluation of the Wayback Machine’s view of the past, as well as TrackingExcavator, which we plan to release with this paper, will aid future study of these questions.
