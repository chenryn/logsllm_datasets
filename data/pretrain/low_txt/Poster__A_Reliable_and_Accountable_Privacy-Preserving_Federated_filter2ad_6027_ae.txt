### Optimized Text

When the privacy parameter is set to 10, which is the upper bound in our experiment, we achieve an accuracy of 97%. Therefore, our designed approach ensures both high accuracy and robust privacy protection for local models and data. Additionally, Yin et al. [66] introduced a DeepInversion method that can synthesize class-conditional input images from random noise by leveraging information stored in the batch normalization layer. However, in our trained model, we add Laplacian noise during the training process in the batch normalization layer, making it impossible for attackers to extract the true information stored there. Consequently, their method is ineffective against our trained model.

### VIII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

In this paper, we present a blockchain-based crowdsourcing federated learning (FL) system designed for IoT device manufacturers to better understand their customers. Our system integrates multiple state-of-the-art technologies, including mobile edge computing servers, blockchain, distributed storage, and federated learning. To protect customer data privacy, we enforce differential privacy. We also introduce a new normalization technique that outperforms batch normalization when features are protected by differential privacy, thereby improving the accuracy of the FL model. By designing an effective incentive mechanism, we encourage more customers to participate in crowdsourcing tasks. The blockchain audits all customer updates during federated training, ensuring accountability and preventing malicious activities by customers or manufacturers.

For future work, we plan to conduct more experiments and test our system with real-world home appliance datasets. Additionally, we aim to find the optimal balance between local and global epochs to further enhance the test accuracy.
