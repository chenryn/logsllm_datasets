### Search Results and Suspicious Suggestions

The individual queries containing suspicious suggestions, as reported by the STA (Suspicious Trigger Analyzer), undergo a two-step analysis. This process yields highly accurate findings, with a precision of 96.23% and a recall of 95.63% (Section V).

### Evaluation

In our study, we implemented Sacabuche to automatically analyze 114 million suggestion and trigger pairs, along with 1.6 million search result pages. The analysis was conducted on an R730xd server equipped with 40 Intel Xeon E5-2650 v3 2.3GHz, 25M Cache CPUs, and 256GB of memory. This section details the data collection and large-scale analysis methods.

#### A. Data Collection and Validation

To evaluate Sacabuche, we collected a large number of trigger-suggestion pairs. We first used a set of keywords to iteratively query the autocomplete services provided by Google, Bing, and Yahoo!. The trigger and suggestion pairs discovered through this method were then analyzed by the STA to identify suspicious ones. These query terms were further used to search the engines and gather their result pages. In total, we obtained 114 million suggestion and trigger pairs and 1.6 million result pages, as shown in Table I.

**Trigger and Suggestion Collection:**
To collect these seed triggers, we chose a set of "hot" phrases representing popular search interests. These trigger phrases are mainly trending keywords with a high search volume, totaling 1 million collected from a keyword database [10], covering a broad range of search interests (legal services, financial services, home services, and education). However, they miss some content categories that suggestion manipulators target, such as gambling and pharmaceuticals. To address this, we included 386 gambling keywords [3], [16] and 514 pharmaceutical keywords from drug lists [5] in the dataset.

Using these "seed" keywords, we employed the technique mentioned in Section IV-B to iteratively discover suggestion phrases through autocomplete APIs. For each given trigger, its suggestion list is retrieved from the API and then serves as new triggers to discover their suggestions. This process continues until a search depth limit is met. In our research, we set the search depth to 2 for trending phrases and to 3 for gambling/pharmacy phrases, as the latter are known targets of suggestion manipulation. This autocomplete collection was performed daily for three months, from 02/09/2017 to 05/09/2017, resulting in 114 million unique suggestion and trigger pairs.

**Validation:**
A study on autocomplete manipulation faces the challenge of obtaining ground truth, a common problem in blackhat SEO research [38], [58], [48], [41]. Following prior studies, we used several indicators to manually validate the findings made by Sacabuche. Specifically, we randomly sampled flagged query terms (trigger + suggestion) by grouping their suggestions according to their categories and then randomly selected 100 from each group for inspection. Since this inspection cannot be automated, we manually analyzed each sample, including the search results of a suggestion and related websites and content, to determine its legitimacy based on the presence of certain indicators:
1. A manipulated suggestion must promote a target whose reputation cannot make it stand out in the search results of the trigger.
2. The manipulated suggestion and its search results often conflict with the user's original search intention.

For example, for the suggestion "strongvault online backup free download," we identified the promoted website "strongvault-online-backup.software.informer.com" in the search result pages. We found that this website does not appear in the search results of its trigger ("online backup free download"). Upon manual examination, we were redirected to a phishing website to download suspicious code, which VirusTotal [33] reported as malware. Therefore, we consider this suggestion to be manipulated.

#### B. Parameter Setting

In our experiments, the parameters of our prototype system were set as follows:
- **RBO decay constant (p):** This parameter tunes the weights for different depths in the rank-biased overlap function (Section IV-C). It was set to p = 0.9, following the convention for evaluating the RBO function.
- **Inverse of regularization strength (C):** Regularization reduces overfitting to labeled data when building relation models using logistic regression. We used C = 10, which provided the best performance among other C values from 0.3 to 15.
- **Scaling Factor α in Word Kernel:** This factor scales the word similarity value in the W K kernel. We adopted α = 5, as suggested by the original authors, for good performance across multiple datasets.
- **Decay Factor λ in Sentence Kernel:** This factor penalizes the length of given phrases in the sentence kernel SK(sa, st). Like α in the Word Kernel, we adopted λ = 1, as recommended by the original work.

#### C. Results

**Accuracy and Coverage:**
We first evaluated STA over 100 manipulated trigger-suggestion pairs and 150 legitimate pairs, and then examined SRA over the search result pages of 150 manipulated trigger-suggestion pairs from the bad set (focusing on the top 20 result items), together with 300 legitimate pairs from the good set and their search results, using five-fold cross-validation. Overall, our prototype achieved a precision of 96.23% and a recall of 95.63%.

Next, we ran Sacabuche on the unknown set with 114 million suggestion and trigger pairs. Our STA found 1 million pairs to be suspicious. These pairs were further inspected by SRA, which reported 460K to be illegitimate. Among all detected, 5.6% of manipulated suggestions include links to compromised or malicious websites in their top 20 search results (confirmed by CleanMX [17] and Google Safebrowsing [22]). In this step, we manually inspected 1,000 suggestion-trigger pairs and concluded that Sacabuche achieved a precision of 95.4% on the unknown set.

**Performance:**
To understand the performance of Sacabuche, we measured the time it takes to process 100,000 suggestion-trigger pairs from the unknown set on our R730xd server using a single process. The breakdown of delays observed at each stage (PF, STA, and SRA) is reported in Table III. On average, 28.06 seconds were spent preprocessing those 100,000 suggestion-trigger pairs, and only 1,326 search queries were issued to Google. This demonstrates that Sacabuche scales well and can process a large number of suggestion terms without generating too many queries.

We also compared our implementation of Sacabuche with an alternative solution, called Sacabuche-C, which queries Google for every trigger + suggestion pair and then uses the combined features of STA and SRA to detect manipulated suggestions. This approach is fully tuned toward effectiveness, completely ignoring the performance impact. In our research, we trained Sacabuche-C over the labeled datasets as described in Section III and evaluated it using five-fold cross-validation. This alternative approach has a precision of 97.68% and a recall of 95.59%, indicating that our two-step design does not affect detection effectiveness. However, the performance overhead of Sacabuche-C is at least 94 times larger than our two-step approach, making it impractical to scale.

### Measurement

On the 114 million trigger-suggestion pairs in the unknown set, we conducted a measurement study to understand how today’s autocomplete services are being abused. Our study reveals the pervasiveness of autocomplete manipulations, with 0.4% of the suggestions we collected showing traits typical of illicitly promoted autocompletes. More concerning is that the threat continues to evolve, becoming even more serious over time. We further investigated the ecosystem of this emerging SEO business (see Figure 2) by purchasing and interacting with manipulation service providers. This effort led to the discovery of their strategies, including query log pollution and the use of compromised sites, and their revenues, as high as $569K per week. We also analyzed an attack toolkit and a large-scale malvertising campaign involving 245 manipulated suggestions and 1,672 websites.

#### A. Landscape

**Scope and Magnitude:**
Our study reveals that manipulated suggestion terms are pervasive across multiple search engines' autocomplete services. Out of 14 million trigger phrases on Google, Bing, and Yahoo!, we found that 256K were manipulated, relating to 383K manipulated suggestions. Figure 6(a) illustrates the number of abused suggestions we discovered on different search engines in a single day. Google is the most affected (0.48%) in our dataset, followed by Bing (0.37%) and Yahoo! (0.2%). Additionally, in Google's autocomplete service, 16.6% of manipulated suggestions were ranked in the top 3 autocomplete results, compared to 14.2% in Bing and 29.1% in Yahoo!.

We further investigated the impacts of suggestion manipulations on different search content. For this purpose, we grouped all trigger keywords into 10 categories. Table IV presents the number of manipulated suggestion terms under each category. Such abused suggestions cover a vast range of topics, including home services, education, legal and lending products, technology, gambling, and others. Among these categories, Lending Products (4.13%) have the largest portion of trigger phrases with manipulated suggestions, followed by Home Services (2.47%) and Pharmaceutical Services (2.09%). When we looked at polluted triggers in the Lending Products category, we found 536 "payday loan" related polluted triggers with manipulated suggestions such as "online payday loans get cash now - cashnow.com" and "payday loans cash advances www.quickquid.co.uk." Note that Google bans ads for payday loans in search results [12]. These payday loan websites were able to promote their lending products in search engines through autocomplete manipulation.

**Evolution and Lifetime:**
To understand how this emerging threat evolves over time, we collected 67 million distinct autosuggestions from the Google Autocomplete API from 02/09/2017 to 05/09/2017. Among them, Sacabuche found 324,610 manipulated trigger-suggestion pairs on Google. Figure 6(b) illustrates the evolution of the attack, in terms of the cumulative number of newly-appearing manipulated terms observed during that period. We found that a large number of manipulated suggestions are newly appearing, with 71.3% of newly-appearing manipulated suggestions related to newly-appearing polluted triggers. On average, 1.9% of trigger phrases were polluted, jumping to 2.1% on 03/21/2017. Generally, the trend shows a substantial increase in the number of manipulated suggestions.

When looking into the lifetime of the manipulated suggestion terms, we were surprised by the effectiveness and stealthiness of suggestion manipulation campaigns: they have been present for a long time without being detected. Figure 6(c) illustrates the distribution of the lifetime for these missuggestion terms, estimated through continuous crawling of the seed keywords' autocomplete every day from 02/09/2017 to 05/09/2017. As shown in the figure, 39.3% of the manipulated suggestions stay on Google’s suggestion list for more than 30 days, with an average lifetime of 34 days, comparable to the lifetimes of legitimate suggestions, which average 63 days.

**Manipulation Content and Pattern:**
Our research shows that multiple triggers have been utilized to promote one suggestion. We found that 20% of manipulated terms are related to more than one trigger. For example, the missuggestion "free web hosting and domain name registration services by doteasy.com" is associated with 123 trigger phrases such as "free web hosting without domain name" and "web hosting free domain name registration." Therefore, finding one manipulation suggestion can help detect other polluted triggers.

Another interesting observation is that different manipulated suggestions tend to have similar grammatical structures, as shown in Table V. For example, we found that 1,446 manipulated suggestions follow the pattern "trigger phrase relevant content + by + URL," such as "custom t shirt design software and application tool by panaceatek.com" and "free web hosting and domain name registration services by doteasy.com."
