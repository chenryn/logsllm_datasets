### Introduction
This document presents an analysis of real-world alert data, focusing on the detection and classification of anomalies within different types of alert flows. The primary objective is to identify and highlight interesting phenomena while reducing the burden of manual inspection for operators.

### Analysis of Specific Flows

#### Whatsup
- **Detected Phenomena**: p2, p3, p6, and p8 were detected, while p4, p5, and p7 were missed.
- **Nature of Phenomena**: All phenomena are shifts in constant level activity.
- **Common Factors for Missed Phenomena (K-)**: Smallness of the shift and placement after other anomalies.
- **New Anomalies**: Delayed detection of p4 and p7 due to changes in weekday peak height after a constant level decrease.
- **N- Occurrences**: Five N- occurrences, with two being extra anomalies or duplicates, and three due to changed intensity of weekday peaks compared to the previous week.
- **Comparison with EWMA**: Similar anomalies detected, but the proposed model provides a more accurate representation of normal behavior, even highlighting missed anomalies in the residual series \(E_t\).

#### Destination Unreachable
- **Phenomena**: No known, interesting phenomena; only a weak weekly rhythm.
- **Anomalies Signaled**: Twelve anomalies in total.
- **Interesting Anomalies (N+)**: Three, indicating overall intensity changes in both high (weekday) and low (weekend) activity periods.
- **N- Anomalies**: Nine, with two artifacts created by \(\nabla_{\text{week}}\) and seven unexplained.
- **EWMA Comparison**: Signaled over 50% more anomalies, mostly part of the weekly rhythm, and unable to detect level shifts found by the proposed method.

#### LOCAL-POLICY
- **Detected Phenomena**: p2, p4, and p5 were signaled, p3 was missed.
- **Missed Phenomenon (p3)**: Change in high-frequency peak intensity levels from 1 to 2, among peaks reaching up to 10,000 alerts.
- **New, Interesting Phenomena**: Four new phenomena, including additional or missing peaks breaking the weekly rhythm and changes in periodic peak intensity.
- **N- Anomalies**: Five, with two artifacts, two anomalies on extremely high peaks (part of the weekly rhythm), and one anomaly possibly caused by variations in low-level components.
- **EWMA Comparison**: Had difficulties, signaling every peak and unable to leave out peaks following the weekly rhythm.

#### Speedera
- **Known Phenomena**: p1 and p2, both detected.
- **N+ Anomaly**: n2, indicating lower-than-normal intensity on a Friday.
- **N- Anomalies**: Two related to artifacts created by \(\nabla_{\text{week}}\).
- **Artifact n1**: Created by the AR(p) model starting predictions from the (p + 1)th observation and the detection component needing more data for correct thresholding.
- **Visualization**: Good examples of unwanted artifacts and filtering of normal flow behavior.
- **EWMA Comparison**: Signals anomalies only at the beginning of every Monday, unable to cope with strong periodic components and non-dramatic changes in flow behavior.

### Discussion
- **Model Capabilities**: Detects sharp and impulse-like peaks and valleys outside the day and week rhythms. Can detect shifts in constant components and overall intensity, but detrending makes detection of small shifts difficult.
- **Residual Series**: Preceding variations can mask current anomalies, as the detection threshold is based on standard deviation.
- **Improvements**: Possible enhancements by developing the detection component or customizing smoothing factors and thresholds, but the current approach is sufficiently generic and deployable.
- **Operator Benefits**: Reduces the need for manual inspection by 90% or more, allowing operators to focus on more relevant tasks.
- **False Positives and Misses**: Few artificial phenomena, typically easy to identify. Misses some small changes close to larger disturbances, but the number of false positives is relatively small.

### Conclusions
- **Methodology**: Tailored for specific alert types and volumes, revealing significant structure in alert flows.
- **Alert Processing**: Highlights interesting phenomena and reduces the burden of manual inspection.
- **Sampling Interval**: One-hour interval used, reasonable for the nature of processed alerts.
- **Future Work**: Potential for pushing processing towards sensors for certain alert flows.
