### Title: BlackHat Asia 2023: Insider Threats Packing Their Bags with Corporate Data

**Abstract:**

What if your organization could identify which employees are exfiltrating data before they leave? According to the 2020 Securonix Insider Threat Report, 60% of insider threats involve "flight risk" employees who are planning to depart. While this issue is well-recognized, it remains challenging to address, particularly as cloud services become more prevalent and the distinction between personal and business traffic becomes increasingly blurred.

In this presentation, we will explore the indicators we have used in a large-scale production environment to detect employees who are exfiltrating data prior to their departure. Our approach involved analyzing anonymized data from over 4 million users across more than 200 organizations worldwide. This data was collected from a subset of Netskope users with prior authorization.

Our analysis revealed that approximately 15% of all departing employees used personal cloud applications to take data with them. Based on these findings, we developed models to identify insider threat flight risks and tested them over several months. These models successfully identified multiple instances of data exfiltration that would have otherwise gone undetected.

We will share the behavioral insights we uncovered for employees preparing to leave, including the types and volumes of data they target, and the cloud providers they use. Our goal is to provide organizations with actionable indicators to better protect their data.
