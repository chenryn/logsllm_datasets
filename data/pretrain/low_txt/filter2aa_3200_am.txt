**Current Interoperable Communications Initiatives:**
- **Fiber Optic Project:** For UASI II and 04 UASI, the state is laying or tapping into existing fiber optic cable networks to provide communication infrastructure for Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs) and seats of government in the Urban Area partners. This project is near completion and will connect the Snohomish County EOC and County Executive’s Office to the Governor’s Office in Olympia. It also includes the purchase of comparable satellite phones for each site.
- **Helicopter Downlink Project:** Using 04 UASI funding, aviation assets and EOCs for each Urban Area partner are being fitted with video downlink capability. This will allow video images from helicopters in any jurisdiction to be transmitted to any or all EOCs in the urban area.

**Current Interoperable Communications Initiatives:**
- **Statewide Interoperable Communications Project:** West Virginia is implementing a statewide interoperable communications project using a digital trunked radio system supported by a microwave communications backbone. When completed, this system will enable first responders to maintain interoperable communications throughout the state. The system is fully functional in areas where the backbone and trunked sites have been completed. West Virginia is also working with surrounding states to implement interoperable communications capabilities.

**Current Interoperable Communications Initiatives:**
- **Regional Approach:** Wisconsin has adopted a regional approach to communications interoperability, recognizing that any statewide system must build on existing local systems. Several regional groups have formed, including the Northeast Wisconsin Communications (NEWCOM) group, the West Central Interoperability Alliance (WCIA), the Northwest Radio Users (NWIOU), the Fox Valley Communications (FOXCOM) group, a central three-county effort, and a southeast Wisconsin regional group. These regional efforts cover 58 of Wisconsin’s 72 counties.
- **Statewide Interoperability Strategic Plan:** Wisconsin is developing a statewide interoperability strategic plan to define operational and technical specifications, ensuring performance standards are met. In 2004, the Wisconsin Office of Justice Assistance (OJA) contracted with Federal Engineering, Inc. to conduct a statewide study of interoperable radio communication capabilities and provide recommendations. This resulted in grants totaling $1.8 million for region-specific engineering studies.

**Current Interoperable Communications Initiatives:**
- **Stopgap Systems:** Several subgrantees have expanded their Command and Control capacities through the purchase of mobile command posts and interoperable communications suites. The state has purchased 7 ACU 1000 Interconnect communications systems, allowing disparate communications systems to work seamlessly during high-threat or crisis events.
- **WYO-LINK Project:** Wyoming is expanding the WYO-LINK Project, a comprehensive interoperable communications system. This initiative includes the creation of a steering committee and will connect all radio frequencies in the state through 57 radio sites. The project will cost approximately $51 million, funded partially by G&T funds and partially by Wyoming State funds. FY05 G&T funds are almost exclusively dedicated to interoperable communications through this and other equipment initiatives.

- **Data Collection:** The data in this report is gathered from the Grants Reporting Tool (GRT) as of April 18, 2006. GRT data represents planned project expenditures based on the Initial Strategy Implementation Plan (ISIP) and the BSIR. It does not necessarily represent actual expenditures. Project-level data for FY 2003 was not collected, so the figures reported for Interoperable Communications Equipment Funding may not represent the entire amount of funding for FY 2003. This information is subject to change based on updates to the GRT by users.
