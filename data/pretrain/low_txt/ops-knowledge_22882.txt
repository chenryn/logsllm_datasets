When using Ghostscript, I encounter an issue where the process terminates unexpectedly and throws an exception to `stdout`, which I am unable to catch and log. I suspect this problem arises when I use Asian fonts. Has anyone else encountered and resolved this issue?

It is possible that you need to read from `stderr` of the child process to capture the error messages.
