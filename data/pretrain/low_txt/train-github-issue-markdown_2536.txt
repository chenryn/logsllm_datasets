I work in an environment where logging in as an administrator is not permitted. Instead, we must use the "Shift + Right-click" and select "Run as different user" to access administrative privileges. 

Currently, Windows Terminal only supports running with elevated administrator privileges. However, for my daily tasks, I need the ability to run it as a specific, non-administrative user. To date, I have not seen any Universal Windows Platform (UWP) applications that support this functionality, which leads me to believe it may not be possible.

**Bonus:** It would be even more beneficial if I could launch each tab in Windows Terminal as a different user, while still maintaining the settings and core user interface under my primary user account.

Thank you in advance for any assistance or guidance.

P.S. I find the current security policy to be quite restrictive.
