**Update:** For those in a hurry, please refer to my comment below for instructions on how to install all the necessary dependencies for Julia on Ubuntu 12.04.

It would be highly beneficial to have an Ubuntu PPA (Personal Package Archive) that consolidates all the software required to compile Julia. This could significantly reduce compilation times and serve as a valuable first step toward providing actual binary packages of Julia for Debian-based systems.

Based on my testing, the following packages are required to build Julia:

- `gfortran`
- `llvm-3.1-dev` (available from the PPA: `ppa:dr-graef/llvm-3.1.precise`)
- `libblas-dev`
- `liblapack-dev`
- `libarpack2`
- `libpcre3-dev`
- `libglpk-dev`
- `lighttpd`
- `libgmp-dev`
- `libunwind7-dev`
- `libreadline-dev`

However, there are some additional considerations:
- **SuiteSparse**: Only version 3.4.0 is available in the repositories, while version 4.0.2 is needed. You may need to download and install this manually.
- **FFTW**: Installing `libfftw3-dev` did not work for me, as it resulted in a `LoadError`. Instead, I allowed Julia to compile its own FFTW, which worked successfully.
- **zlib**: The default installation does not include large file support, so you may need to configure and install zlib with this feature enabled.
- **Other Dependencies**: There may be other dependencies that I have not yet identified. If you encounter any issues, please let me know.

By addressing these points, we can streamline the process of setting up Julia on Ubuntu 12.04.
