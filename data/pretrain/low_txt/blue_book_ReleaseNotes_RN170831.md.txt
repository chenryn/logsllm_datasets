### Feature Updates

- **Baseline Mode for AzSDK Scans:**
  - Introduced support for 'baseline mode' in AzSDK scans. In this mode, a centrally defined 'control baseline' is used as the target control set for scanning. This mode can be configured as the default behavior for CA scans and can also be activated manually by using a switch in the scan commands.
  
- **Enhanced OMS View:**
  - A new OMS view has been added, displaying subscription, ERNetwork, and resource security status. The view includes numerous usability improvements, making it easier to review and resolve baseline control failures for various resource types.

- **New SVTs for Azure Functions:**
  - New Security Verification Tests (SVTs) have been added specifically for Azure Functions.

- **Preview of 'Fix Controls' Feature:**
  - A preview of the 'fix controls' feature is now available. This feature can be triggered using the "-GenerateFixScript" switch in the scan commands. When enabled, AzSDK generates automated fix scripts for a subset of failed controls, which can then be executed to quickly remediate these issues.

- **Checkpointing Support for Get-AzSDKAzureServicesSecurityStatus:**
  - The `Get-AzSDKAzureServicesSecurityStatus` command now supports checkpointing via the "-UsePartialCommits" switch. When this switch is used, the command periodically saves scan progress to disk. This allows the scan to resume from the last saved state if interrupted or if an error occurs. This feature is particularly useful for CA scans where Azure may forcefully suspend long-running automation jobs.

- **Enhancements to CA Runbook:**
  - The CA runbook has been enhanced with various telemetry capabilities, including tracking the difference between resources present in a subscription and those actually scanned via CA. For virtual machines, additional metadata is now available, such as VM type and whether the VM is on an Express Route circuit.

### Other Improvements and Bug Fixes

- **Support for Classic/ASM Cloud Services:**
  - Added support to scan classic/ASM Cloud Services with ARM Reader privileges, bringing them into the scope of CA scans.

- **Control Attestation with Severity-Based Expiry:**
  - Control attestation now supports different expiry intervals based on severity. These expiry periods can be configured in the backend.

- **Updated PDF Report Generator:**
  - The PDF report generator has been updated to include control attestation data.

- **Updated List of Deprecated/Central Accounts:**
  - The list of deprecated/'white-listed' central accounts has been updated.

- **Decommissioned AzSDK Control Info Sites:**
  - The AzSDK control information sites at `aka.ms/azsdktcp` and `aka.ms/azsdkosstcp` have been decommissioned. The content has been moved to GitHub.
