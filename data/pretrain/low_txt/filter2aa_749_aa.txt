    - What would you like us to look at next?
    - What shouldn’t we be doing?
    - Who/What/When/Where/Why/How?

## We Build Too!
- We also build secure systems, but the focus of this talk is on "academic security analyses."
- Visit our websites for more information!

## Part 1: Our Hacks
### Background
- **Academic Model**
  - Experiment with technologies.
  - Analyze existing ones.
  - Build new ones.
  - Publish results in peer-reviewed venues (conferences, journals).
  - As scientists, we seek to learn new things and improve our world, using rigorous approaches.

- **Links to Papers**
  - Follow the links provided in subsequent slides for detailed examples of academic papers.

### Type A: Analyzing Critical Systems
- **Properties of These Projects**
  - Focus on critical systems important to people and society.
  - Often previously understudied technologies or applications.
  - Papers must have broader implications, not just attacks.
  - Results can influence public policy and legislation.
  - Include discussions of possible defenses.

#### Example: Analysis of an Electronic Voting Machine
- **Authors**: Tadayoshi Kohno, Adam Stubblefield, Aviel D. Rubin, Dan S. Wallach
- **Conference**: IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, 2004
- **Link to Paper**: [PDF](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/yoshi/papers/eVoting/vote.pdf)

### The FUTURE!
- **Case of the Diebold FTP Site**
  - **Pre-2003**: Concerns about e-voting security, but no public access to source code.
  - **2003**: Diebold source code posted on an anonymous FTP site, found by Bev Harris.
  - **CVS Repository**: From October 2000 to April 2002.
  - **First Opportunity**: To publicly analyze the source code of a real e-voting machine.

#### New Opportunity
- **Analysis of Diebold’s AccuVote-TS Version 4.3.1 Source Code**
  - Many of the computer scientists' worst fears were confirmed.

#### Step 1: Determine How the System Works
- **System Overview**
  - **Pre-Election**: Poll workers load ballot definition files.
  - **Active Voting**: Voters use tokens to activate machines and vote.
  - **Post-Election**: Stored votes are transported to the tabulation center.

#### Step 2: Analyze Security and Privacy Under Different Threat Models
- **Problems Identified**
  - Lack of authentication for ballot definition files.
  - No authentication between voter token and terminal.
  - Hard-coded encryption key.
  - Votes transmitted in cleartext.

#### Step 3: Follow Through
- **Toward Better E-Voting**
  - Identify, study, and address challenges in designing better e-voting machines.
  - Active research area with significant funding and collaboration.

### Type B: Measuring What’s Happening in Today’s World
- **Properties of These Projects**
  - Shed light on unknown aspects of today's world.
  - Improve network and system artifacts.
  - Protect against these networks or systems.
  - Broad impacts on public policy and legislation.
  - Include discussions on lessons learned, predictions, and possible improvements.

#### Example: Detecting In-Flight Page Changes with Web Tripwires
- **Authors**: Charlie Reis, Steven D. Gribble, Tadayoshi Kohno, Nicholas C. Weaver
- **Conference**: USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation, 2008
- **Link to Paper**: [PDF](http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/security/web-tripwire/nsdi-2008.pdf)

- **ISP-Injected Ads**
  - Reports of web page modifications.
  - ISPs injecting ads into web pages.
  - Scientifically study and measure the phenomenon.

- **Detecting Page Changes**
  - Use JavaScript to detect changes.
  - Built a Web Tripwire that runs in the client's browser.
  - Compares the original and modified HTML.

- **Attracting Visitors**
  - Posted to Slashdot, Digg, etc.
  - Visits from over 50,000 unique IP addresses.

- **Analyze the Results**
  - 657 clients saw changes (1.3%).
  - Changes made by client software, agents in the network, and various other sources.
  - Diverse incentives, often concerning for publishers.

- **Types of Changes**
  - Injected advertisements, compression, security checking scripts, popup and ad blockers, and malware.

- **Unanticipated Impact**
  - Some changes inadvertently broke pages.
  - Introduced vulnerabilities, such as XSS, which can be exploited by attackers.

## Conclusion
- **Discussion and Q&A**
  - Open floor for questions and discussion.
  - Your feedback and insights are valuable to us.
