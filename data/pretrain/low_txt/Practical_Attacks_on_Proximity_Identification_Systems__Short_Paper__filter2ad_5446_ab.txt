### Table 1: Distance Performance for Each Antenna/Amplifier Setup

## 3.2.2 Token to Attacker’s Antenna
After activating the token, the next step is to retrieve the token's response. The best result for detection distance (\(d_e\)) was obtained using the A5 antenna with the 1 W amplifier, as shown in Figure 3(b), along with a comparative measurement at approximately half the maximum distance. This result was surprising because we expected the range to increase with higher power. However, we only achieved \(d_e = 50 \, \text{cm}\) using the same antenna with the 4 W amplifier and \(d_e = 135 \, \text{cm}\) using the same amplifier with the A4 antenna. This discrepancy can be attributed to several factors:

- The amplitude of the load modulation is absolute and not proportional to the carrier signal. As the carrier is amplified, the relative effect of the load modulation decreases, reducing the modulation index and, consequently, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
- This behavior was consistent across tokens from different vendors with the same form factor.
- The amplitude of the reflected load modulation decreased as the distance (\(d_p\)) increased. Even though the token could be activated at the distances mentioned, it had to be moved closer to the loop antenna to create a sufficient effect for eavesdropping. This negated the advantage of larger antenna/amplifier combinations.
- Analysis of the transmitted signal from the reader showed some carrier leakage into the sidebands. When the carrier is amplified, the receiver has difficulty isolating the sidebands, and the input amplifiers saturate before the small data signals can be detected. In a specially designed attacking reader, care could be taken to improve the spectral properties of the carrier signal, allowing for the recovery of smaller sideband signals and increasing both \(d_p\) and \(d_e\).

Despite this, the threat of this attack is somewhat diminished as \(d_p\) ended up quite small for the best case of \(d_e\). However, 15 cm is still sufficient to execute an attack in a crowded area and easily allows reading a card in someone's pocket or bag.

## 4. Relay Attacks
A relay attack involves information passing through the attacker's hardware between the legitimate reader and the token. This presents a practical example of the grand master chess problem. An attacker can use two transponders to relay the information exchanged during a cryptographic challenge-response protocol. A proxy-token device is placed near the real reader, and a proxy-reader device is placed near the real token, possibly unknown to its holder. Information can thus be forwarded over a great distance if a suitable communication medium is chosen between the proxy-token and proxy-reader. As a result, the reader will report that it has verified the presence of a remote token and provide access to the attacker.

We implemented a practical relay attack and achieved a relay distance of 50 meters using a cheap FSK RF link [9]. The timing constraints were not as strict as defined in the standards, allowing sufficient time to relay messages, even with a 20 μs delay introduced by our hardware. The necessary hardware parts were easily obtainable, and the cost of the whole system was well under $100, with most of the cost being an OEM RFID reader. The system was then modified using an FPGA development board to implement an adjustable delay, determining the maximum attacking window.

It was possible to buffer and delay the data for a period of time, provided it was clocked out on the rising edge of the reader's clock. We systematically increased the delay and tested the system by reading the token's ID. At 750 μs, the system still functioned normally. Errors started occurring when the delay reached 1 ms, and no data was read once the delay reached 5 ms. The allowed time delay might be dependent on the reader and its setup, so the experiment should be repeated with a few readers to get an accurate result.

We also considered the possibility that an attacker could alter data before relaying it back to the reader. Using the same experimental system, we successfully modified a token's ID response, which is unencrypted and only uses a byte-wise XOR for integrity. This offers possibilities for further work on how this could affect older payment systems using stream ciphers with limited integrity checking.

## 5. Countermeasures
We briefly discuss how tokens are protected and to what extent current mechanisms and card data can be compromised by the attacks mentioned in the previous sections.

- **Passive Eavesdropping:** Can be mitigated by implementing confidentiality and privacy mechanisms. Active scanning is prevented by authentication. Papers on RFID security concentrate on minimalist cryptography protocols for EPC type tags. Suggested authentication and privacy protocols use pseudonyms and hash locking [17,23]. Further protocols suggest modifying the anti-collision protocols [28] or providing blocking tags [19]. Few of these ideas are currently implemented, with the EPC standard only specifying a 32-bit password and kill code option to prevent active scanning.
- **ISO 14443 Tokens:** Generally provide stronger algorithms such as RSA, DES, AES, and some vendors provide proprietary algorithms, e.g., Philips Crypto1. These tokens have a fixed Unique Identifier (UID) used for anti-collision, which could be used to track a specific card. The subsequent Protocol and Parameter Selection (PPS) could provide more information about the origin/use of the card before security mechanisms are invoked. Some access control systems, despite the cryptographic capability of their tokens, simply use the UID for access control purposes, making them vulnerable to simple replay attacks.
- **ICAO New Password Standard:** Using ISO 14443 tokens, only specifies mandatory "Passive Authentication," which only proves that the data is authentic. "Basic Access Control," which would provide confidentiality, is an optional feature. If not implemented, it would allow the attacker to eavesdrop on the passport owner's personal information [18].

**Relay Attacks:** Cannot easily be prevented by cryptographic protocols operating at the application layer of an RFID protocol stack. An attacker executing a relay attack cannot avoid causing a delay in the system. Distance-bounding or secure-positioning protocols are therefore a possible defense. Brands and Chaum [4] described the first distance-bounding protocol based on timing the single-bit round-trip delay in a cryptographic challenge-response exchange to prevent relay attacks. Since then, several protocols based on technologies such as RF [3], Received Signal Strength (RSS) [8], and Ultrasound [25] have been proposed. These protocols are not ideal for RFID devices as they require excessive power and processing resources, and little attention is paid to practical considerations such as noise and error correction. Kuhn et al. [10] proposed a new distance-bounding protocol for RFID devices. Further research in this area might lead to protocols with sufficient resolution to prevent unauthorized readers from accessing tokens outside a trusted boundary.

## 6. Conclusion
The RF communication interface of 'proximity' tokens is vulnerable to practical attacks. We demonstrated that an eavesdropper can intercept a two-way communication sequence between a legitimate reader and token from 4 meters and that it is possible to scan a token's response from approximately 1.5 meters away after activating it from a distance of 15 cm using a magnetic loop antenna. We also showed how relay attacks can successfully spoof the location of authentication tokens and that the permissible system delay provides an opportunity for attacks on the system's integrity by allowing enough time for the modification of legitimate communication sequences.

Currently, these attacks are at the proof-of-concept stage, and further work, such as digital signal processing or specially designed receivers, could increase the eavesdropping range. Nevertheless, the current implementations still present a credible threat, as they are within the capabilities of an attacker with a limited budget and some RF/electronic knowledge. It would be interesting to see similar results for tokens using standards other than ISO 14443 A, e.g., ISO 14443 B. We hope that the results presented here can serve as a starting point for more research into the security aspects of RFID communication interfaces.
