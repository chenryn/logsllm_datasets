# Denial of Service (DoS) Attack Detection and Recovery in IP Telephony Networks

## Figures and Data

**Time (minutes):**
- 23, 25, 27, 29, 15, 13, 17

**Call Volume:**
- 200 URIs with 1 call per minute

**Graphical Representation:**
- **(b)** 
  - Time (minutes): 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29

### Figure 10: Aggregate Level Detection of Stealth DoS Attack
- **Parameters**: \( \text{oagg} = 1 \) and \( \text{Tagg} = 2 \)

**Observations:**
- Lowering the values would allow for stealthier attacks to be detected but would also increase the false alarm rate.

## Table 2: Detection Time for Various DoS Attacks
| Attack Type | Detection Time (URI level) | Detection Time (Aggregate level) |
|-------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 4 calls/min Limited DoS | 4 minutes | - |
| 10 calls/min Limited DoS | 2 minutes | - |
| 50 URI Aggressive DoS | 6 minutes | - |
| 200 URI Stealth DoS | - | 8 minutes |

## Table 3: Recovery Time for Limited DoS Attack on a Small Number of URIs
| Attack Volume - Recovery Algorithm | Recovery Time |
|-------------------------------------|---------------|
| 4 calls/min - Linear Recovery | 3 minutes |
| 10 calls/min - Linear Recovery | 17 minutes |
| 10 calls/min - Exponential Recovery | 6 minutes |
| 10 calls/min - Reset after Timeout | 3 minutes |

## Analysis and Discussion

### Performance Evaluation
- The detection times for four types of DoS attacks are shown in Table 2. The results in Figures 6, 9, and 10 indicate that the larger the volume of attack calls, the shorter the detection time.
- Surprisingly, the stealth attack was detected faster than the aggressive attack due to the higher overall call volume in the stealth attack (200 calls per minute to 1-200 different URIs) compared to the aggressive attack (150 calls per minute to 3-50 different URIs).

### Recovery Algorithms
- To evaluate the performance and impact of different recovery algorithms, a limited DoS attack targeting a low-volume URI was used.
- Figures 6b, 7, and 8 provide a graphical representation of the recovery algorithms' operation.
- The linear recovery algorithm performed substantially lower than the exponential and reset after timeout algorithms.
- For real-world deployments, the increased complexity of using the exponential or reset after timeout algorithms is acceptable due to the significant improvement in performance.

### Normalization and Legitimate Traffic
- To ensure the detection algorithm works independently of the volume of legitimate traffic received by any URI, limited attacks targeting two URIs from different user categories were considered.
- For users with high-volume legitimate traffic, the normalization factor \(\hat{C}(n)\) in Equation 1 is large, reducing the value of \(X_n\) because \(X_n = \frac{\hat{n}}{\hat{C}(n)}\).
- Figure 6b shows the impact of this normalization, with the peak value of the attack on the high-volume URI being 25% less than the low-volume URI target.

## Other Deployment Issues

### ALAS Placement
- **ALAS behind the SIP Proxy**:
  - Placing ALAS behind the SIP Proxy changes the characteristics of the traffic seen by the sensor.
  - During an attack, the sensor will not see all incoming calls, and the response mechanisms activated in the proxy will influence the traffic pattern.
  - This requires modifications to the detection and recovery algorithms, which is the scope of future work.

- **Protection for PSTN Originated Attacks**:
  - In a converged network, attacks can originate from the PSTN.
  - Detecting and controlling such attacks can be done by placing an ALAS in series with the Media/Signal Gateway (MSG).
  - The MSG must generate Transfer Controlled (TFC) messages or Release Busy messages for targeted E.164 numbers based on the severity of the attack.

## Related Work
- **Detection and Protection of DoS Attacks**:
  - Yau et al. [31] developed a scheme to include throttles in network routers using a leaky-bucket approach.
  - Pushback and Aggregate Congestion Control [18, 10, 13] are other approaches to countering DoS attacks at the network infrastructure.
  - Burns and Ghosal [4] examined media-stimulated focused overloads in the PSTN.
  - SYN cookies [3] and SYN cache [17] are extensions to the network protocol stack to reduce resource consumption.
  - Garg and Reddy [11] presented a prototype system for enforcing QoS restrictions.
  - Wang et al. [30] introduced an algorithm that exploits normal TCP behavior to detect SYN flood attacks.

## Conclusion
- This study provided a detailed examination of DoS attacks against IP telephony-enabled enterprise networks.
- Dedicated sensors at the transport and application layers were implemented, using a non-parametric cumulative sum algorithm for detection.
- The performance and impact of three different recovery algorithms were evaluated, and the detection algorithm correctly identified three types of DoS attacks.
- Future work includes understanding the impact of various sensor parameters and integrating techniques to detect DoS attacks using malicious media flows.
