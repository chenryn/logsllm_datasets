### Limitations and Future Directions

The current study, while offering valuable insights into worm detection and mitigation, is limited in both the number and scope of the tested worms. We hope that researchers with access to larger datasets or more extensive test environments will be willing to share their resources for further testing and validation. Despite our use of real packet traces from three distinct sources, a broader and more comprehensive study is essential to confirm the scalability of our proposed methods and to assess whether the diversity of content flows across different sites can effectively detect common attack vectors during a worm outbreak.

### PAYL: A Novel Approach to Worm Detection

PAYL demonstrates a remarkable ability to identify new worms without relying on predefined signatures. By correlating the content alerts generated by PAYL, we can significantly reduce false positives and generate detailed content signatures. These signatures can then be used to filter out worm attacks at multiple sites. We believe that this approach presents a substantial challenge to worm creators, and we wish them nothing but failure and frustration in their attempts to circumvent these new defensive systems. Furthermore, we posit that the problem of worms will ultimately be mitigated through the formation of defensive "coalitions," making network systems generally safe from this class of cyber threats for the foreseeable future.

### On Interactive Internet Traffic Replay

#### Abstract

In this paper, we introduce TCPopera, an interactive Internet traffic replay tool designed to achieve two primary goals: (1) replaying TCP connections in a stateful manner, and (2) supporting traffic models for trace manipulation. TCPopera emulates a TCP protocol stack and replays trace records interactively, ensuring no ghost packet generation, which is critical for live test environments. Our validation tests demonstrate that TCPopera successfully reproduces trace records in terms of various traffic parameters and can be deployed in test environments for intrusion detection and prevention systems.

#### 1. Introduction

The network research community has a persistent demand for traffic generation tools that can create realistic test conditions. Trace-based traffic replaying and analytic model-based traffic generation are two common approaches. While trace-based replaying is easy to implement, it may not be representative of real-world conditions. Analytic model-based generation, though challenging, allows for tuning traffic parameters. TCPopera combines the strengths of both approaches, providing stateful TCP emulation and support for traffic models, making it suitable for test environments where both realism and protocol accuracy are crucial.

#### 2. Related Work

Several open-source traffic replay tools, such as TCPreplay, TCPivo, Monkey, and Tomahawk, have been developed for testing security products. However, they often lack the capability to handle complex interactions and stateful TCP connections. TCPopera addresses these limitations by providing stateful TCP emulation and support for traffic models, making it a more versatile tool for live test environments.

#### 3. TCPopera

##### 3.1 Design Goals

TCPopera aims to:
- Ensure no ghost packet generation through stateful TCP emulation.
- Support traffic models for adjusting traffic parameters.
- Provide environment transformation features like address remapping and ARP emulation.
- Handle inter-connection dependencies within IP flows.
- Be deployable in large-scale emulation environments.

##### 3.2 Components and Implementation

TCPopera consists of several components:
- **Flow Preprocess**: Extracts IP flows from input trace records and collects necessary information for TCP control block initialization.
- **Traffic Models**: Allows users to adjust traffic parameters using configuration files.
- **TCP Functions**: Emulates TCP connections and handles packet transmission.
- **Packet Injection and Capturing**: Manages the injection and capturing of packets for replay.

Our validation tests show that TCPopera successfully reproduces trace records and can be effectively used in live test environments for evaluating intrusion detection and prevention systems.

#### 4. Validation Tests

Our tests compared TCPopera's traffic to input trace records, demonstrating successful reproduction of IP flows without breaking TCP semantics. Additionally, we showed how TCPopera can be deployed in live test environments for IDS/IPS evaluation, revealing interesting differences in Snort's behavior under varying test conditions.

#### 5. Conclusion and Future Work

TCPopera offers a novel approach to traffic replay, combining stateful TCP emulation with support for traffic models. Future work will focus on enhancing application-specific inter-connection dependencies and expanding the tool's capabilities for large-scale deployment.
