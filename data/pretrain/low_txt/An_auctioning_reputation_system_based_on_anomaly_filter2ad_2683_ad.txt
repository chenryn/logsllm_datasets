## Detailed Analysis

### Seller 672
- **Product Type:** Laptop Batteries
- **Auctions:** 20
- **Winning Rate of Top 5% Bidders:** 2%
- **Average Winning Rate of All Bidders:** 13%
- **Classification:** Abnormal with respect to the P model (Figure 5c)
- **Top Two Bidders:**
  - Participated in 15 out of 20 auctions
  - Won none
  - Exclusively buyers, never sold items on eBay
  - Placed bids at about 90% of the final price
  - Consistent with shilling behavior

### Seller 7578
- **Product Type:** Laptop Batteries
- **Auctions:** 439
- **Auctions with Bids:** 248
- **Winning Rate of Top 5% Bidders:** 14%
- **Average Winning Rate of All Bidders:** 40%
- **Classification:** Abnormal with respect to the P model (Figure 5d)
- **Top Two Bidders:**
  - Participated in 40 auctions
  - Won only one auction
  - First bidder bid up to 90% of the final price
  - Second bidder bid very early in the auction, usually with a small bid
  - Both exclusively buyers, never sold items on eBay
  - Abnormality with respect to N (Figure 5b) explained by normal M (Figure 5c)

### Hypothesis
- **Inexperienced Buyers:** Have reduced opportunities to get a bargain from sellers identified as abnormal.
- **Bidding Behavior:** Consistent with shilling, different sets of bidders repeatedly participated and lost in auctions.
- **Final Prices:** Close to prices at other online stores, including reputable retailers.
- **Example of Shilling:** Bidder for seller 7504 bid early and always at the same price, resulting in higher final prices.

### Reputation Analysis
- **eBay Reputations:** Overwhelmingly positive (average 98.7% positive feedback).
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identified as abnormal by our reputation system.
- **Advice for Inexperienced Buyers:** Bid elsewhere.

## Threat Analysis

### Techniques for Normalizing Reputation Scores

#### Normalizing an N Score
- **Objective:** Reduce the number of bids in auctions.
- **Methods:**
  - Using fewer shill bids per auction.
  - Creating a new identity.
  - Adding shill bids to auctions of other sellers.

#### Normalizing an M Score
- **Objective:** Decrease the average number of bids or adjust minimum starting bids.
- **Methods:**
  - Decrease the average number of bids using techniques from Section 6.1.
  - Lower the minimum starting bids.

#### Normalizing a P Score
- **Objective:** Adjust the cumulative bidder presence and win curves.
- **Methods:**
  - Distribute shill bids among more bidders.
  - Let some shill bidders win occasionally.

## Conclusions
- **Reputation System:** Identifies sellers who seem to inflate their prices.
- **Statistical Modeling and Anomaly Detection:** Used to rank sellers and identify suspicious behavior.
- **Real-World Data:** Demonstrated efficacy on eBay data.
- **Findings:** Identified anomalous sellers with high eBay reputations, indicating potential price inflation.
