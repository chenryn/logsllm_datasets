**Auto File System Format Utility (autofmt)**

The `autofmt` command initiates the Auto File System Format Utility, which is used to format a drive or partition. This utility can be accessed and executed from the Windows Recovery Console.

**Important Note:**
- The `autofmt` command cannot be run directly from the command line. It must be invoked through the Windows Recovery Console.

This utility is particularly useful for preparing drives or partitions for use, especially in recovery or setup scenarios.
