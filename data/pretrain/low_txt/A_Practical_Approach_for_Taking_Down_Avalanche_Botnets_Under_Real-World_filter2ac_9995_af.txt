### Pleiades and Other DGA Detection Methods

Pleiades is a system that clusters non-existent domains by analyzing character distributions within domain names and the querying hosts. It uses DNS traffic from large ISPs to discover previously unknown DGAs. Krishnan et al. [53] detected hosts in a botnet by analyzing patterns in DNS queries for non-existent AGDs through sequential hypothesis testing. Mowbray et al. [64] identified hosts querying domains with unusual length distributions, discovering 19 DGAs, nine of which were previously unknown.

Subsequent work focused on detecting AGDs on a per-domain basis. Schiavone et al. [77] introduced Phoenix, a system that uses linguistic features to detect potential AGDs. It then employs linguistic, IP-based, and DNS-based features to cluster domains and extract properties of the DGAs that generated them. Abbink and Doerr [9] and Pereira et al. [68] highlighted that most classifiers focus on detecting randomness in AGDs, making them ineffective for dictionary-based DGAs. They proposed new methods to address this limitation. Multiple deep learning-based approaches have since been proposed [82]. Spooren et al. [85] found that a deep learning model by Woodbridge et al. [96] outperformed the human-engineered features of the model by Schüppen et al. [78].

### Takedowns of Botnet Infrastructures

Previous coordinated takedowns of botnet infrastructures have been studied to evaluate their long-term effectiveness in preventing further abuse. Nadji et al. [65] presented rza, a tool that uses a passive DNS database to analyze and improve the effectiveness of botnet takedowns. They evaluated the tool for three malware families and found mixed long-term impacts. Asghari et al. [17] analyzed the institutional factors influencing the cleanup effort of the Conficker worm, finding that cleanup was slow and that large-scale national initiatives did not have a visible impact. Shirazi [80] surveyed and taxonomized 19 botnet takedown initiatives from 2008 to 2014. Plohmann et al. [71] analyzed the structure of DGAs for 43 malware families and variants, identifying domains missed in takedowns, families with few sinkholed domains, and delays in seizing AGDs registered by malicious actors. Alowaisheq et al. [12] studied the lifecycle of takedown operations across sinkholes and registrars based on passive DNS and WHOIS data, finding several flaws that could allow malicious actors to regain control of some sinkholed domains. Hutchings et al. [42] provided insights into the effectiveness of takedown efforts by interviewing key actors, finding that law enforcement faces more challenges than commercial enterprises in carrying out takedown operations.

### Conclusion

Taking down the domains used by compromised machines to communicate with command and control servers is an effective measure to disrupt botnets like Avalanche. However, law enforcement must take care not to affect any legitimate domains that may collide with algorithmically generated domains. For Avalanche, prosecutors manually conducted this classification process, requiring significant time and effort and allowing for human error.

To address this, we developed an automated approach for classifying benign and malicious registered DGA domains, within the constraints of real-world takedown contexts. This approach cannot rely on bulk patterns, detecting ongoing malware activity, or actively connecting to domains. We propose a hybrid model that balances automation with manual classification to achieve higher performance and significantly reduce investigator effort. Our approach aims to represent the Avalanche takedown accurately, reflecting the utility of automated domain classifiers in real-world scenarios, such as our contribution to the 2019 iteration.

Given the increasing number and size of cybercrime operations, automated tools can assist law enforcement investigators in avoiding harmful impacts on uninvolved legitimate parties. These tools will help them stay one step ahead of malicious actors and impair their activities, shielding end users from harm.
