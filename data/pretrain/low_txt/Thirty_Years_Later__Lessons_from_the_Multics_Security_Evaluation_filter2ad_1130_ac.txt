### Expected Roles and Security Assessments

Users are often expected to serve as system administrators for their own desktop systems, despite a lack of formal training. Additionally, quality assurance testing and subjecting systems to authorized (ethical) hackers are common methods to determine the adequacy of system security. There have even been serious proposals [1] suggesting that student hackers could be used to test computerized voting systems. However, it is evident that such approaches are ineffective in detecting the most attractive vulnerabilities for professionals—malicious software triggered by unique keys or passwords unknown to those conducting the assessment.

**Note:** This does not imply that penetration testing or ethical hacking is without value. One of the authors currently works in IBM’s Global Security Analysis Laboratory, an ethical hacking organization. Penetration testing can identify some vulnerabilities, but the failure of a particular team to find any does not guarantee their absence; it only indicates that the team did not detect them.

### Systems and Security Requirements

Systems that are less secure than Multics are being considered for use in environments that even Multics could not handle without restructuring around a security kernel. This situation suggests four possible conclusions: (1) today’s systems are more secure than claimed; (2) potential attackers are less capable or motivated; (3) the information being processed is less valuable; or (4) there is an unwillingness or inability to recognize the need for better technical solutions.

### Technical Solutions

Although Multics was never restructured around a security kernel as recommended, the technical feasibility of building a full-featured commercial operating system around a Class A1-compliant kernel while maintaining good compatibility was demonstrated for the VAX [25]. The successful deployment of a highly secure system using the popular x86 processor with the NSA-certified Class A1 GEMSOS [32] security kernel for VPN security management has also been achieved [42].

In the nearly thirty years since the report, it has been shown that the speculative technology direction can be implemented and effectively addresses the problem of malicious software employed by well-motivated professionals. Unfortunately, major vendors' mainstream products largely ignore these demonstrated technologies. Most vendors argue that the market is not willing to pay for high-assurance security. Customers, on the other hand, claim they have never been offered mainstream commercial products that provide such a choice, leaving them with several ineffective solutions marketed under terms like “defense in depth.”

### Future Implications

In our opinion, this is an unstable state of affairs. It is inconceivable that another thirty years will pass without either horrific cyber disasters depriving society of much of the value computers can provide, or the delivery and enhancement of available technology in products that offer effective security. We hope it will be the latter.

### Acknowledgments

We must thank Iris Partlow of the IBM Business Support Center for retyping the 1974 report. Valuable comments were provided by Mike Thompson of Aesec Corporation, Jeremy Epstein of webMethods, Wietse Venema and David Safford of IBM Research, Steve Sutton of PatientKeeper, and Tom Van Vleck of NAI Labs. Tom also runs the Multics website (http://www.multicians.org), where we found some of the necessary information. Tom, who was the system administrator and a designer of Multics, is thanked for his understanding that our work aimed to make Multics more secure, even if its presentation was sometimes considered overly dramatic.
