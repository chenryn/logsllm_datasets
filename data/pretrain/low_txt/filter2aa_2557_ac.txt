### Time-Shifting and Streaming Media
As more consumers receive audio and video content from streaming Internet sources, they will increasingly demand tools that allow them to preserve their fair use expectations, including the ability to "time-shift" programming for later viewing or listening. However, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) may prevent the development of digital equivalents of VCRs and cassette decks for streaming media.

**Example: Streambox VCR**
Start-up software company Streambox developed a product called the Streambox VCR, designed to time-shift streaming media. When competitor RealNetworks discovered that Streambox had also developed a competing streaming media player, it invoked the DMCA and obtained an injunction against the Streambox VCR product.

**Case:**
RealNetworks, Inc. v. Streambox, Inc., 2000 WL 127311 (W.D. Wash. Jan. 18, 2000).

**Additional Example: Streamripper**
The DMCA has also been used to threaten the developer of an open-source, non-commercial software application called Streamripper, which records MP3 audio streams for later listening.

**Cease and Desist Letter:**

### Embed and Fonts
In January 2002, typeface vendor Agfa Monotype Corporation threatened a college student with DMCA liability for creating "embed," a free, open-source, non-commercial software program designed to manipulate TrueType fonts.

**Student's Explanation:**
"I wrote embed in 1997, after discovering that all of my fonts disallowed embedding in documents. Since my fonts are free, this was unnecessary, but I didn't want to take the time to change the flag and reset all the extended font properties. Instead, I wrote this program to convert all of my fonts at once. The program is very simple; it just requires setting a few bits to zero. Other fonts licensed for unlimited distribution also disallowed embedding, so I put the program online to help other font developers."

Despite the program's legitimate uses, Agfa Monotype threatened the student author with DMCA liability for distributing it, arguing that it could be used to distribute protected fonts.

### Unintended Consequences: Four Years Under the DMCA

#### 5. A Threat to Innovation and Competition
The DMCA is being used to hinder the efforts of legitimate competitors to create interoperable products.

**Example: Blizzard Video Game Division**
Vivendi-Universal's Blizzard video game division invoked the DMCA to intimidate developers of a software product derived from legitimate reverse engineering.

**Example: Sony Aibo Robot Dog**
Sony has used the DMCA to threaten hobbyists who created competing software for Sony’s Aibo robot dog, as well as to sue makers of software that allows the playing of PlayStation games on PCs.

**Lexmark Toner Cartridges**
Lexmark, the second-largest printer vendor in the U.S., has long tried to eliminate aftermarket laser printer toner vendors. In December 2002, Lexmark invoked the DMCA to sue Static Control Components for "circumvention" of certain "authentication routines" between Lexmark toner cartridges and printers. Lexmark added these authentication routines to hinder aftermarket toner vendors, and Static Control reverse-engineered these measures to sell "Smartek" chips that enable aftermarket cartridges to work in Lexmark printers.

**Sony Sues Connectix and Bleem**
Since the DMCA’s enactment in 1998, Sony has used DMCA litigation to pressure competitors who created software allowing PC owners to play PlayStation games. In 1999, Sony sued Connectix Corporation, the manufacturer of the Virtual Game Station, and Bleem, the leading vendor of PlayStation emulator software for Windows PCs. Both companies engaged in legitimate reverse engineering, but were forced to pull their products off the market due to high litigation costs.

**Sony Threatens Aibo Hobbyist**
Sony invoked the DMCA against a hobbyist who developed custom programs for Sony’s Aibo robotic "pet" dog. The hobbyist cracked the encryption surrounding the source code to reverse engineer programs that allow owners to customize voice recognition. Despite not revealing the decrypted source code or making a profit, Sony claimed the act violated the DMCA and demanded the removal of the programs. Public outcry led Sony to permit the hobbyist to repost some programs, but the incident highlighted Sony’s willingness to use the DMCA in non-piracy-related situations.

**Blizzard Sues bnetd.org**
Vivendi-Universal's Blizzard Entertainment video game division sued a group of volunteer game enthusiasts who used reverse engineering to create free and open-source software (bnetd) to allow owners of Blizzard games to play over the Internet. Blizzard alleged that bnetd is a circumvention device that violates the DMCA, though the software has numerous legitimate uses for owners of Blizzard games.

**Sony Attacks PlayStation “Mod Chips”**
Sony has sued manufacturers of "mod chips" for alleged circumvention under the DMCA. These chips modify PlayStation consoles to permit games legitimately purchased in one region to be played on consoles from another region. Sony sued mod chip manufacturers in the U.S., the U.K., and Australia. An Australian court recently ruled against Sony, recognizing the anti-competitive potential of the region playback control system.

**Apple Harasses Inventive Retailer**
Other World Computing (OWC), a small retailer specializing in Apple Macintosh computers, developed a software patch to allow all Mac owners to use Apple’s iDVD software. Apple claimed this constituted a violation of the DMCA and requested that OWC stop the practice. This prevented consumers from upgrading their older Macs with external DVD recorders, forcing them to buy new Macs instead.

### Conclusion
Four years of experience with the DMCA’s "anti-circumvention" provisions demonstrate that the statute reaches too far, chilling a wide variety of legitimate activities in ways Congress did not intend. As more copyrighted works are wrapped in technological protection measures, the DMCA’s anti-circumvention provisions are likely to be applied in further unforeseen contexts, hindering the legitimate activities of innovators, researchers, the press, and the public at large.
