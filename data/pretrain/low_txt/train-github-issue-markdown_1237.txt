I assume that the 1-D Hilbert transform function in the `signal` module was intended to behave similarly to its MATLAB equivalent. Specifically, when applied to an N-dimensional array, it should perform the transformation only along the zeroth dimension.

However, I encountered an issue where the Hilbert transform returned zeros when applied to two-dimensional arrays. This patch addresses and resolves this problem. The root cause was incorrect arguments being passed to the `ifft` function.

**Summary:**
- **Issue:** The 1-D Hilbert transform function in the `signal` module returns zeros for two-dimensional arrays.
- **Expected Behavior:** The function should perform the Hilbert transform along the zeroth dimension, similar to MATLAB's implementation.
- **Fix:** Correct the arguments passed to the `ifft` function.

This patch ensures that the Hilbert transform works correctly for multi-dimensional arrays, aligning with the expected behavior.
