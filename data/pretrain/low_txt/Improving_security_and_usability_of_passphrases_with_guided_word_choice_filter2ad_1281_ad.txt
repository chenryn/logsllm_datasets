### Group 20 Analysis
The lower frequency of participants in Group 20 selecting the second line of the array can explain the observed distribution. Similarly, positional effects may account for why the distribution is closer to Corpus(30) than Corpus(100).

### Mnemonic and Syntactic Patterns
One might expect participants to use mnemonics and create sentence-like passphrases with common patterns. However, the only syntactic pattern that appeared more than three times was 8% of participants choosing three nouns in a row. Given that nouns form the majority of the dictionary used, even these passphrases remain secure, reducing the entropy by at most 5 bits (out of more than 96 bits of entropy). Surprisingly, having more words to choose from did not increase the tendency to create syntactically correct sentences but reduced it instead.

### Positional Bias and Security
The positional bias should be viewed as an additional security feature rather than a weakness. Since the position is truly random, a stronger positional bias leads to a more uniform and higher-entropy passphrase. This holds true as long as the adversary cannot access the initial word list; otherwise, the system becomes insecure.

### Language Proficiency and Word Choice
Word choice patterns were consistent across different levels of English proficiency. These results apply not only to native English speakers but also to those for whom English is a second language, with minor differences in word choice and no significant difference in memorability.

### Participant Guessing Task
The task where participants guessed each other’s words served a dual purpose: to distract and impair their memory and to determine if a simple strategy could explain their choices. The absence of highly successful participants suggests that if a general strategy exists, it has eluded both the researchers and the participants.

### Presentation of Word Fields
Unfortunately, we did not compare multiple ways of presenting the word field. While a linear presentation was not tested, it would likely be less user-friendly.

### Conclusion
This study demonstrates that guiding people to choose from an array of random words can build high-entropy, memorable passphrases. This method prevents the selection of easy-to-guess favorite words. Although there is a slight reduction in entropy compared to random passphrase generation, the improved usability and memorability offset this. Larger dictionaries can be used since people can choose words they know, resulting in final entropy levels exceeding random passphrase generation by 20-30%, reaching 95-98 bits of entropy.

### Main Predictors of Word Choice
The primary predictor of word choice from the random word array was the familiarity of the word to the participant, regardless of whether they were primary or non-primary English speakers. This bias was weaker than expected, and letting people choose from an array achieved between 97% and 99% of the maximal entropy, depending on the size of the array.

### Array Size and Memorability
A larger array size, providing more choices, was linked to improved memorability of the passphrase. With a 100-word array, 94% of participants remembered at least 5 out of their 6 words the first time they were asked, despite performing a distractor task. In practical use, remembering the passphrase should be relatively easy.

### Security and Usability
The advantage of selecting from an array of random words is that it provides users with an easy way to create secure and memorable passphrases using only a random generator and a dictionary. Security is maintained by generating the array locally on the user's machine when needed. Sending the list over the network is highly inadvisable as it drastically lowers the entropy, especially if the adversary knows the position of the words. However, this should not be a problem in practice, as the secret array can be produced on any machine with the dictionary and code requiring less than 300KB of memory.

### Future Research Questions
- How well does short-term memorability with a distractor task predict long-term memorability for passphrases?
- Can placing high-frequency words closer to the middle of the array compensate for the positional advantage?
- Can other visual presentations, such as word clouds, make word choice from the presented set even more uniform?
- Would the high uniformity of word frequency be as or even more successful with even larger dictionaries, such as the full SOWPODS with its 276,663 words?
- Why is choosing from 100 words more memorable than choosing from 20? It isn't because people took longer, as they didn't. It might be due to more personalized choices or the ability to select more familiar words. Does memorability continue to increase with arrays of more than 100 words? What is the nature of the trade-off, and must there be a compromise between entropy and memorability?
- How does the size of the array affect reading patterns and word choice? Does the left-wise bias in Group 20 come from different reading patterns?
