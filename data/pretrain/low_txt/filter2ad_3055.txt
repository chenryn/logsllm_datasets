## Abstract
This workshop focuses on the application of scientific practices to cybersecurity research. The objective is to examine the implementation of scientific methods in cyber defense research and to understand the implications of trade-offs between simplifications for interpretable results and observational studies of systems in real-world settings, which may lead to ambiguous interpretations. The accepted research papers address a wide range of technical questions in the cyber domain, with the maturity of the work spanning from initial ideas and proofs of concept to mature work ready for operational implementation. Papers were evaluated based on the reproducibility of the work, as represented by the documentation of methods and testing environments.

## 1. Introduction
There has been significant interest recently in the science of cybersecurity. For research to be considered scientific, it must follow a series of steps to ensure repeatable, reproducible, and verifiable results. These steps include:

- Define a tractable problem.
- Ensure falsifiability.
- Obtain ground truth.
- Document assumptions and test them.
- Assess progress toward the larger problem.
- Start with simple experiments.

Upon completing this cycle, the process repeats, incorporating previous results into the problem and assumptions.

The focus of this workshop is the application of scientific practices to cybersecurity research. The objective is to examine the implementation of these practices in cyber defense research and to understand the ramifications of trade-offs between simplifications for interpretable results and observational studies of systems in real-world settings, where results can lead to ambiguous interpretations.

## 2. Topics
The workshop will consist of papers, presentations, and a panel discussion on cybersecurity research and the means of applying scientific processes to that research. The following topics are of interest:

- Configuration evaluation, testing, forensics, debugging.
- Continuous monitoring and response.
- Cyber resiliency, agility, and moving target defense.
- Cost-effectiveness.
- Resilience and agility effectiveness.
- Testbeds.
- Research infrastructure.
- Verification techniques.
- Validation techniques.
- Testing and evaluation methods.
- Cyber-physical systems security.
- Security configuration verification and economics.
- Security metrics, including adversarial and user measures.
- Security policy management.
- Theory of defense-in-depth.
- Mission metrics, including mission assurance, mission measures, and conflicting mission management.

## 3. Program
The workshop will feature a combination of peer-reviewed and invited papers, a keynote presentation, and a panel discussion.

- **Keynote Presentation**: Dr. William (Bill) Sanders, Department Head of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, will discuss the processes of transitioning from good science to good engineering in the context of cybersecurity and cyber resilience.
- **Panel Discussion**: The panel will include Bill and professors from the University of Texas at Dallas, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and at least one other panelist to be named shortly. Each panelist will also present introductory remarks as invited talks.
- **Paper Presentations**: The remainder of the program will consist of 15 and 30-minute presentations by the authors of accepted papers. Full paper authors will have 30 minutes each, while short paper authors will have 15 minutes each.

## 5. Workshop Chairs
- **Nicholas J. Multari** provides programmatic and technical guidance to cybersecurity research programs at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). Before joining PNNL, he led trusted cyber technology research at Boeing Research and Technology in Seattle, Washington. In 2008, he served as a consultant to the USAF Scientific Advisory Board (SAB), investigating the effects of the contested cyber environment on the USAF mission. He has held positions as a Senior Security Engineer with Scitor Corporation in Northern Virginia and as a computer scientist in the Air Force, retiring as a Lt. Col. He is a member of external advisory boards at the University of Washington and Iowa State University and an associate editor of the Data and Knowledge Engineering Journal by Elsevier. He received his PhD in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Austin.

- **Anoop Singhal** is a Senior Computer Scientist in the Computer Security Division at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, MD. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio. His research interests include network security, network forensics, cloud computing security, and data mining systems. He is a member of ACM, a senior member of IEEE, and has co-authored over 50 technical papers in leading conferences and journals. He holds two patents in the area of attack graphs and has co-edited a book on Secure Cloud Computing.

- **Erin Miller** is the current chair of PNNL’s Science Council, a group of empirical researchers whose purpose is to bring science-based practices to cybersecurity research. She is a research scientist in the Radiation Detection & Nuclear Sciences group at PNNL and the Technical Team Lead for Radiation Imaging and Materials Science. She has led projects developing methods for gratings-based x-ray imaging for explosives detection, gamma emission tomography for verification of nuclear fuel, and inverse problems in radiation detection, such as localizing and describing radioactive sources in aerial surveys, pedestrian searches, and in combination with radiographic data in cargo containers. She holds a PhD in Physics from the University of Washington.
