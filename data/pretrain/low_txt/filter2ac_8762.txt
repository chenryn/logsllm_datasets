**Description:**
Turla, a well-known threat actor, has been observed using the `net user` command to enumerate local accounts on compromised systems. This technique allows the adversary to gather information about user accounts, which can be used for further exploitation or lateral movement within the network. References to this activity can be found in [48] and [49].
