## Introduction

The rise of e-commerce has fundamentally transformed business practices, compelling managers to reevaluate their strategies. Organizations now face the challenge of managing e-business systems, e-commerce applications, Web services, Web processes, and workflows. Web services and Web processes offer a promising solution to many of today's infrastructure challenges, such as data, application, and process integration. With the advent of Web services, workflow management systems have become essential for supporting, managing, and enacting semantic Web processes both between and within enterprises (Sheth, van der Aalst, & Arpinar, 1999).

There is a growing consensus that Web services alone are insufficient for developing sophisticated and valuable Web processes due to the high degree of heterogeneity, autonomy, and distribution on the Web. Researchers agree that Web services must be machine-understandable to enable the full deployment of efficient solutions supporting all phases of the Web process lifecycle. The concept of the "Semantic Web" (Berners-Lee, Hendler, & Lassila, 2001) has gained traction, and both researchers and companies recognize its potential benefits. Ontologies (Uschold & Gruninger, 1996) are considered the foundational building blocks of the Semantic Web, as they facilitate machine-supported data interpretation, reducing the need for human involvement in data and process integration. For the travel industry, the development of ontologies is crucial for enabling machine-supported interpretation and integration of travel-related data.

Our research aims to help the travel industry fully leverage the near-universal access to the Internet. One of the fastest-growing categories in the travel industry is the creation of dynamic vacation travel packages. The goal of dynamic packaging is to consolidate all components chosen by a traveler into a single reservation. Regardless of the origin of the inventory, the package is handled seamlessly as one transaction, requiring only one payment from the consumer. This can be achieved efficiently, interoperably, and scalably through the development of a commonly accepted communication technology using Web services, Web processes, and semantics. Semantics and ontologies provide a shared understanding of data between travelers and travel-related businesses, promoting the development of interoperable systems that can create and support new collections of travel services to better meet the demands and expectations of travelers and the travel industry.

## Travel Industry Trends

The travel industry, due to its reliance on long-distance interactions, was one of the earliest adopters of electronic commerce (e.g., the Sabre system, which began operating in 1959). It is one of the most significant sectors of e-commerce, representing almost 40% of all global electronic commerce (Filho & Ramos, 2003) and exemplifying the transformative impact of this technology on business processes (Carroll, 2002).

With the proliferation of the Internet and the growth of e-commerce, there has been a shift from traditional offline distribution processes based on operator catalogs to online promotion and reservation processes. This shift is marked by isolated initiatives driven by the B2C (business-to-customer) promise of increased profit margins and reduced commission values. This has led to a diverse and numerous group of online reservation systems, most of which focus on one or a few types of products without an integrated view of vacation planning, which is what consumers seek.

As a result, the most recent trend in the travel industry is dynamic packaging. Dynamic packaging enhances packaging revenues and margins per transaction while offering travelers new opportunities to save by booking flights, hotels, or rental cars together in a single transaction.

## Research Objectives

Currently, the travel industry is focused on developing open specification messages based on eXtensible Markup Language (XML) to ensure seamless message flow between industry segments. For example, the OpenTravel Alliance (OTA, 2004) is an organization pioneering the development and use of specifications that support e-business among all segments of the travel industry. The collaborative efforts of various teams, individuals, associations, companies, and international organizations, including air, car, cruise, rail, hotel, travel agencies, tour operators, and technology providers, have produced a comprehensive set of XML-based specifications for the travel industry (over 140 XML specification files exist).

The Web has permanently changed how vacation packages are created. Consumers can now acquire packages from a variety of websites, including online agencies and airlines. With the spread of Web travel, a new technology has emerged for the leisure travel industry: dynamic packaging. To develop dynamic packaging solutions, it is necessary to examine the technology components needed to enhance the online vacation planning experience. By transitioning from a third-party service in most markets, dynamic packaging engines can better tailor their offerings, pricing, and merchandising to consumer demand.

Our research objective is to help the travel industry fully leverage the latest Internet technologies, such as Web services, Web processes, and semantics, to develop dynamic packaging solutions. Semantics allow for rich descriptions of Web services and Web processes that can be used by computers for automatic processing in various tourism-related applications. The deployment of ontologies helps articulate a well-defined set of common data elements or vocabulary that can support communication across multiple channels, expedite the flow of information, and meet travel industry and customer needs.

Semantic Web services will enable the automatic discovery, composition, integration, orchestration, and execution of inter-organization business logic, making the Internet a global common platform where organizations and individuals can communicate and carry out various commercial activities, providing value-added services. In the context of tourism, there is significant interest in these powerful capabilities. Major airlines, hoteliers, car rental companies, leisure suppliers, travel agencies, and others are interested in creating and implementing industry-wide, open e-business specifications, tools, and Web processes involving Web services.

## Practical Results

Our research will lead to the development and fostering of cross-industry consensus needed to establish and maintain the most effective and widely used specifications for electronically exchanging business data and information among all sectors of the travel industry using ontologies.

The development of a suitable ontology for the tourism industry will serve as a common language for travel-related terminology and a mechanism for promoting the seamless exchange of information across all travel industry segments. The current development of open specification messages based on XML, such as the OTA schema, to ensure interoperability between trading partners and working groups, is not sufficiently expressive to guarantee automatic exchange and processing of information.

The primary outcome of our research will be the development of a comprehensive and precise reference ontology named COTRIN (Comprehensive Ontology for the Travel Industry). Major airlines, hoteliers, car rental companies, leisure suppliers, travel agencies, and others can use COTRIN to integrate autonomous and heterogeneous Web services, Web processes, applications, data, and components residing in distributed environments. The objective of COTRIN is to be deep and complex, implementing rich semantic interrelationships between the nodes of its taxonomies, derived from the data and terminology present in the XML-based OTA specifications (Figure 1). COTRIN will be developed using the Web Ontology Language (OWL, 2004) designed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

With COTRIN, semantic Web processes for managing dynamic packages will determine which Web services are used, what combinations of Web services are allowed or required, and specific rules will dictate how the final retail price is computed (Cardoso et al., 2004).

This work represents the potential of combining two of the hottest R&D and technology application areas: Web services and the Semantic Web, as recognized at the Twelfth International World Wide Conference (2003) and in the industry press. The intelligent combination of Web services and the Semantic Web can initiate a technological revolution with the development of semantic Web processes (Cardoso & Sheth, 2003). These technological advances can ultimately lead to a new generation of Web-based applications.

## Impact on the Portuguese Tourism Industry

Our research has a direct impact on the Portuguese tourism industry, as well as the global tourism industry. Portugal is renowned for its tourism, generating over $7.2 billion in revenue in 2002 alone (INE, 2004). The deployment of ontologies, Web services, and Web processes for the tourism industry will enable the construction of sophisticated infrastructures to support e-commerce and e-business activities. These ontologies encourage the development of interoperable systems that can create and support new collections of travel Web services to better meet the demands and expectations of travelers through dynamic packaging.

The main sectors of the industry affected include airlines, car rental agencies, hotel corporations, leisure suppliers, tour operators, railways, ferry operators, cruise operators, and any other area of travel and tourism.

## Conclusions

New trends in the travel industry require the ability to dynamically compose travel packages from the aggregation and orchestration of distributed Web services. As demand for customized travel itineraries grows, agencies seek technology that provides their clients with the flexibility to build unique packages from a selection of choices. Dynamic packages can be created and booked effortlessly with private and published air, car hire, hotels, attractions, and insurance rates.

Current approaches using XML-based specification messages are not sufficient to enable the creation of dynamic travel packages. One solution is the use of ontologies to overcome semantic problems arising from the autonomy, heterogeneity, and distribution of Web services. Our research targets the development of a comprehensive and functional ontology, named COTRIN, relating the terms commonly used by the tourism industry when exchanging data and information to deploy and manage Web processes for dynamically composing travel packages.
