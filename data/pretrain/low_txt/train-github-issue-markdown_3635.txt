When using Command+Click on a button or element within a site that is styled with version 2.3.1 (to open the link in a new tab), the click event is not registered.

To confirm this issue, I tested it on the `docs/index.html` file from the repository. Tabbed browsing functions correctly in all 2.x versions, including 2.3.0, but the functionality is broken in version 2.3.1.
