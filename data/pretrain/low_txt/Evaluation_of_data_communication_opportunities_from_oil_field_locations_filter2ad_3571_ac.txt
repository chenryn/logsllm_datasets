### 4.2.1 Cellular Link Availability

**Figure 6: Cellular Link Availability at WIL1**

During the data collection period in August at WIL1, we observed frequent interruptions on wireless links caused by weak signal strength. Figure 6 illustrates the cellular link availability, showing over 1,100 interruptions with a peak rate exceeding 10 times per hour.

In such scenarios, data access from field locations to the Internet is best described as a delay-tolerant network (DTN) [24]. Applications running over these data links should incorporate disruption and delay-tolerance features to handle intermittent link availability, as discussed in [3].

### 4.2.2 TCP Throughput Profiling

**Figure 7: CDF of Average TCP Throughput**

In April 2011, each SLA crew conducted between 200 and 1,000 FTP uploads via Verizon’s cellular links. Additionally, the SLA1 ATT dataset included 2,000 FTP uploads. Furthermore, a BGAN link was used for more than 600 FTP uploads by the SLA1 crew from October 2010 to November 2010. No FTP uploads were conducted on the VSAT link due to its strict management, which allows only business applications with approved bandwidth consumption profiles.

Figure 7 presents the cumulative density functions (CDFs) of average TCP throughput for these datasets. We observe significant variations in average TCP throughput over cellular links, attributed to fluctuations in signal quality and spectrum usage contention. Verizon’s cellular service provides a higher maximum uplink speed (500 kbps) compared to AT&T’s (250 kbps), but with greater variability. The BGAN link, being tightly managed with limited background traffic, exhibits more stable average TCP throughput.

Previous studies [2, 4] have investigated temporal correlations and predictions of TCP throughput over wireless links at small time scales (tens of seconds). Our study focuses on average TCP throughput over larger time scales.

**Figure 8: TCP Throughput at Each Hour of the Day**

Figure 8a shows the average TCP throughput of each upload from the SLA1 ATT dataset, categorized by the hour it started. Each dot represents the average TCP throughput measured at a specific hour, and the 5th and 95th percentiles are indicated. Although the 5th to 95th percentile ranges are similar across different hours, the 25th to 75th percentile range is narrow, indicating that a significant portion of measurements cluster around the median value.

Average TCP throughput is generally low during busy hours and higher otherwise. This is likely due to spectrum usage contention and diurnal congestion on the cellular service provider's backbone. As median values vary significantly by hour, collecting hourly statistics can aid in predicting TCP throughput.

Figure 8b, based on over 6,000 TCP throughput measurements from Verizon’s service for SLA1-4 in April and May 2011, shows a similar hourly-shifted pattern.

### 4.2.3 End-to-End Latency

**Figure 9: CDFs of End-to-End Latency**

End-to-end latency is a critical metric affecting TCP stack performance and application service quality. To measure this, ping packets were sent over SLA1-4’s cellular and VSAT links with intervals of 5 and 15 minutes, respectively. Ping packets were also sent over SLA4’s BGAN link every 15 minutes.

Figure 9 shows the end-to-end latency measurements for August 2011. The VSAT link's latency is stable around 500 ms, while the BGAN link has a lower bound of 1,000 ms with 80% of measurements around 2,000 ms. Cellular links have a better lower bound of around 200 ms but exhibit heavy-tailed distributions, indicating occasional long latencies.

Although BGAN and cellular links may have higher availability than the VSAT link, they may not be suitable for applications with strict latency requirements. This suggests the need for joint use of multiple network interfaces for effective data communication in remote areas. Managing these links is challenging due to the additional criteria of latency, cost, and availability. Future work will evaluate whether making the TCP stack aware of latency discrepancies can improve rate adjustment.

### 5. Summary and Future Work

In 2010, we conducted a coverage evaluation in a U.S. region to confirm the expanding presence of cellular data services in remote areas. Variations in service coverage and data link speed were high due to distances from test locations to cellular towers and unfavorable terrestrial conditions. Using two antennas improved cellular link speed, but did not affect coverage.

Encouraged by the overall good coverage, we conducted comprehensive field tests with five oil field operation crews in 2011, evaluating communication opportunities provided by satellite and cellular links over 300 days. In certain regions, cellular data links showed comparable availability to satellite links, suggesting potential operational cost reductions. Delay-tolerance capabilities are essential for applications using these links due to intermittent availability.

We plan to extend our measurement study to other geographical regions and provide more detailed characterizations at finer time granularities. This includes measuring end-to-end latency and jitter to evaluate the feasibility of introducing more interactive applications like real-time collaborations between office and field locations. We will also investigate interactions between the TCP/UDP stack and link characteristics for potential transport layer tuning to improve performance.
