## Abstract
"Bitcoin is a rare case where practice seems to be ahead of theory." — Joseph Bonneau et al. [3]

This tutorial aims to bridge the gap between IT security research and the domain of cryptographic currencies and blockchains. We will use Bitcoin as a primary example, given its prominence and the foundational nature of its blockchain mechanics, which are also relevant to other altcoins and derived systems. The tutorial focuses exclusively on the technical aspects of IT security, omitting legal, sociological, financial, and economic considerations.

Designed for participants with a solid background in IT security, the tutorial does not require prior knowledge of cryptographic currencies. It quickly delves into core aspects of the field. This version incorporates feedback from the WWW2016 [9] tutorial and includes customized content.

**Keywords:** Cryptographic currencies, blockchain, Bitcoin

## 1. Introduction
With a current market capitalization of approximately $9 billion, Bitcoin has demonstrated the feasibility of a decentralized cryptographic currency, handling roughly 200,000 transactions per day [2]. Since its launch in 2009 by an entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto [11], the topic of cryptographic currencies has gained widespread recognition.

The emerging field of cryptographic currencies and consensus ledgers, commonly referred to as blockchains, is attracting increasing interest from diverse communities, including technical enthusiasts, activists, researchers, startups, large enterprises, public authorities, banks, financial regulators, business people, investors, and even criminals [10]. The scientific community has been relatively slow to adapt to this fast-moving field.

Initially, the only available resources were the Bitcoin source code, blog posts, forum discussions, mailing lists, and other online publications, including the original Bitcoin paper [11], which was published without peer review. Following this spirit, much innovation in the field has come from the community through online publications and conversations, rather than traditional peer-reviewed channels.

This rapid, free software development, combined with the business aspects of cryptographic currencies and the time-to-market focus of the industry, has led to a flood of publications, whitepapers, and prototypes. However, this has also resulted in a lack of systematization and theoretical understanding.

This tutorial aims to address these gaps by providing a well-structured introduction to the field from a technical perspective. Given that Bitcoin is the archetype for modern cryptographic currencies and consensus ledgers, we will detail its inner workings and discuss its relevance to other systems.

## 2. Methodology
A web-based challenge environment will be available online for all participants during the tutorial. As a practical exercise and a method of gamification, we will distribute small amounts of Bitcoin as rewards for solving challenges. Participants are encouraged to bring their laptops to fully engage in the tutorial. Challenges range from quiz questions solvable with a browser to small practical tasks.

During the tutorial, we will provide references for further study, linking to a comprehensive bibliography of relevant scientific publications and key online resources [1].

## 3. Outline of the Tutorial
### History of Cryptocurrencies
- A brief overview of the history of cryptographic currency research, tracing its roots back to the 1980s and David Chaum's publications [4, 5, 6].

### Ingredients for Proof-of-Work Based Cryptocurrencies
- An overview of the required cryptographic concepts for mainstream cryptocurrencies and blockchains, including proof-of-work (PoW) schemes [1, 7]. This section will cover the basic characteristics of the PoW schemes used in Bitcoin, ensuring all participants have a common foundation.

### Bitcoin and Blockchain Mechanics
- An in-depth look at how the components of Bitcoin and the blockchain work together to form a PoW-based cryptographic currency. Topics include blocks, transactions, mining, the blockchain, Bitcoin scripting language, transaction fees, blockchain forks, and double-spending [12, 13, 3, 8].

### Open Challenges and Outlook
- A discussion of currently unsolved challenges in the field.

## 4. Intended Audience
This 75-minute tutorial assumes no prior knowledge of cryptographic currencies but requires a good general understanding of information security at a graduate CS student level, with a focus on security. The goal is to present structured knowledge from various sources, providing researchers with practical fundamentals and practitioners with a scientific background.

Key takeaways:
- Practical fundamentals of PoW-based cryptographic currencies
- A good understanding of the underlying blockchain mechanics
- An overview of related literature in the field

We will focus on the technical aspects and will not cover legal, sociological, financial, or purely economic aspects of cryptocurrencies.
