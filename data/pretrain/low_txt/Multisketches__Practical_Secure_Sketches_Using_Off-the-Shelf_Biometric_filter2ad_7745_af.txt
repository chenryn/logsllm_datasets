### Protecting Biometrics with Secure Sketches and Fuzzy Extractors

To protect biometric data, secure sketches and fuzzy extractors are often employed. These cryptographic techniques were first introduced by Dodis et al. [29]. Secure sketches can recover a fingerprint using a helper string (generated during enrollment) and a slightly altered version of the original fingerprint. Fuzzy extractors, similar to secure sketches, enable the extraction of reliable random bits from noisy biometric data. Although these methods are foundational, they require the redesign of biometric matching algorithms, which can compromise accuracy.

Previous research has explored the design of such matching algorithms (or distance functions) for fingerprints [52], irises [36, 63], and faces [57]. However, these custom algorithms often degrade matching performance, making them impractical [32]. Consequently, fingerprints are typically protected by encrypting them at rest and decrypting them during matching. In mobile devices, dedicated hardware is often used to protect fingerprints. For a detailed discussion on the gap between theory and practice in this area, see [38, 51].

### Introducing Multisketch

We propose a new template protection technique called multisketch. This system is compatible with any matching algorithm, thereby addressing the long-standing issue that has prevented template protection algorithms from being widely adopted. The primary drawback of multisketch is its requirement for multiple biometric features—potentially from different modalities—for each individual and a large number of users (e.g., thousands) to provide meaningful security. These requirements are met in current large-scale biometric databases [3, 11].

### Conceptual Similarity and Differences

Our multisketch construction is conceptually similar to the set-distance secure sketch construction by Juels and Sudan [39], which conceals valid set elements using fake "chaff" ones. In our approach, the real set elements of other users serve as the "chaff." Additionally, while Juels et al. [39] assume exact matching between a conjectured and valid set of elements during decoding, we introduce approximate matching via biometric matching algorithms. 

Bard [15] proposed approximate matching passphrases by allowing users to log in with minor typographical errors. Bard's method uses a fixed dictionary of words, ensuring no two words are closer than an edit distance of two. Users must pick a passphrase from this dictionary. In contrast, multisketch operates without such constraints and does not require a dictionary.

### Complementary Techniques: sMPC and SFE

Secure multi-party computation (sMPC) and secure function evaluation (SFE) protocols [16, 23, 62] complement multisketches rather than serving as alternatives. In a multisketch system, templates and proffered biometrics could be (k, n)-secret-shared among n distinct servers, with matching performed using MPC. An attacker would need to compromise at least k servers to access the underlying database and attack the multisketch system. However, such use of MPC is prohibitively expensive.

Existing literature instead focuses on using SFE for privacy-preserving queries, ensuring that no information about the query is revealed to the server and no information about the database is revealed to the client unless a successful match occurs. SCiFI [53] achieves this for face recognition but requires 0.3 seconds per matching operation, making it impractical for large databases. In contrast, multisketches provide strong protection against biometric database breaches with a practical computational cost.

### Conclusion

Biometric template protection has been a long-elusive goal. As large-scale biometric databases become more prevalent, they will be attractive targets for attackers. A breach could compromise the biometric identities of millions or even billions of users.

We introduce a new cryptographic primitive, multisketch, to protect large-scale biometric databases. Multisketch works with multiple biometrics, including different modalities, and is compatible with any underlying biometric matching algorithm. To protect stored templates, multisketch removes the association between user identity and their biometrics, storing them in random order. Only when a user provides a set of biometrics nearly identical to the originally given ones can the templates be recovered. Multisketch can be used for verification and generating high-entropy keys.

We detail the design of a multisketch for tenprints, called TenSketch, and prototype it using a NIST-released tenprint dataset. Using the Bozorth3 matching algorithm, we demonstrate the feasibility of TenSketch for real-world deployment. The computational and matching performance can be improved by using more advanced matching algorithms and updating the template information stored in the database, with minimal overhead. This biometric agility is a key benefit of a multisketch system.

We explore the correlation between different fingerprints of a user using advanced machine learning techniques and build classifiers to identify fingerprints from the same user. We simulate possible attacks and show that, even in a conservative setting, the attacker’s benefit is marginal, providing at least 58-bits of security for a database of 2,500 individuals. Databases with more users would be more secure. Synthetic fingerprints [20] can further enhance security, though more investigation is needed to understand how easily they can be distinguished from real ones.

Multisketch built on multi-modal biometrics is expected to be more secure. Further research on the correlation among fingerprints and other biometrics will help better estimate the security of multisketch in practice. Techniques to de-correlate fingerprints will also improve the security of multisketches.
