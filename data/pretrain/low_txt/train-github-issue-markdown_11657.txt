### Electron Version
15.1.0

### Operating System
Ubuntu 18.04

### Architecture
x64

### Last Known Working Electron Version
15.0.0

### Expected Behavior
When invoking a context-menu event on the `webContents` of a `webview` in the renderer process, the function should work without producing any errors.

### Actual Behavior
Since the introduction of #30831, the `frame` object is included in the parameters. However, the `frame` object is not serializable and therefore cannot be passed from the main process to the renderer process. This results in an error being displayed to the user.

### Testcase Gist URL
_No response_

### Additional Information
I am aware that accessing `webContents` in the renderer process (using `@electron/remote`) is considered an antipattern. Nevertheless, I believe this functionality should not be broken in a minor release.
