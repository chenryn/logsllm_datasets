### Introduction
- First Defcon talk 16 years ago.
- Involved in various random projects.
- Let's dive right into the content.

### What We’re Doing
- **Easy Mode**: Listen along to get a sense of the available Golang malware components.
- **Expert Mode**: Follow the links to code samples, interviews, and other resources to learn how to create and detect Golang malware.

### Agenda
1. Binject Origin & Why Golang is Cool
2. Malware Core Components
3. Exploitation Tools
4. EDR & NIDS Evasion Tools
5. Post-exploitation Tools
6. Complete C2 Frameworks

### Long, Long Ago…
- Interest in anti-censorship during an Iranian election.
- Evaluated Tor’s obfsproxy2 and thought it could be improved.
- Started the Ratnet project as an excuse to learn Golang.

### Golang is Magic
- Comprehensive standard library (Crypto, Networking, FFI, Serialization, VFS).
- Built-in compiler and runtime features (Cross-compiler, Tests, Asm, Threads, GC).
- Unparalleled third-party library support.
- Rust is still catching up, but Golang sets a high bar.

### Main Reason I Love Go
- It’s the fastest way to complete a project.
- Fastest way to learn Go: [golang.org/doc/effective_go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go)

### Go Facts
- Statically compiled, not interpreted.
- ~800k runtime compiled in.
- Embedded assembly language based on Plan9’s assembler.
- Allows low-level operations without CGO or external toolchains.
- Go Assembly Write-up: [Go Assembly on the ARM64](https://www.symbolcrash.com/2021/03/02/go-assembly-on-the-arm64/)

### So Stuxnet Happened
- Everyone got interested in environmental keying.
- Josh Pitts created Ebowla in Golang.
- EDRs started writing signatures for Ebowla, targeting the Golang runtime.
- Docker, Terraform, and other tools emerged, making it harder for EDRs to signature Go programs.
- Leveraged Ratnet for exfiltration.
- Collaborated with other security professionals interested in Golang.

### #golang: The Best Place on the Internet
- Community of helpful, friendly people writing malware.
- Key contributors: capnspacehook, vyrus001, ahhh, sblip, C-Sto, omnifocal, aus, ne0nd0g, audibleblink, magnus stubman, + ~500 others.
- Thanks to everyone for their contributions!

### Offense and Defense
- We are all working security engineers and red-teamers.
- Goal: Communicate a deeper understanding of what is possible and how things work.
- Everything discussed is open source, useful for both offense and defense.
- Don’t be an OSTrich (Ostrich).

### Golang Reversing
- Limited reversing tools due to static compilation.
- Gore/Redress: Extracts metadata from stripped Go binaries.
- IDAGolangHelper: IDA scripts for parsing Golang type information.
- golang_loader_assist: Related blog post.

### Binject/debug
