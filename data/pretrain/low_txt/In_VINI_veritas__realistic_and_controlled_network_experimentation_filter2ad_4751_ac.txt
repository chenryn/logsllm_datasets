# Integrated Architecture for Testing Hand-Off in a Mobility Scenario

## 1. Introduction
The following text describes an integrated architecture designed to test hand-off in a mobility scenario, leveraging both wired and wireless networks. The setup involves PlanetLab-VINI and ORBIT nodes, with the aim of investigating hand-off issues between access points that may belong to different Internet Service Providers (ISPs).

## 2. Network Configuration
### 2.1 Bridge Configuration
**Figure 7: Example of Bridge IP Configuration**
- **Interface Configuration:**
  - `ath0` and `tap0` are configured with the subnet `192.168.102.0/24`.
  - `br0` is configured with the IP address `192.168.102.2` and a netmask of `255.255.255.0`.

### 2.2 Router Configuration
**Figure 8: Example of Router IP Configuration**
- **Interface Configuration:**
  - `br0` is configured with the IP address `192.168.102.1` and a netmask of `255.255.255.0`.
  - `ath0` is configured with the IP address `172.19.0.1` and a netmask of `255.255.255.0`.
  - A route is added to `172.20.0.0/24` via gateway `172.19.0.3`.

## 3. Experiment Description
### 3.1 Topology
**Figure 9: Integrated Architecture for Testing Hand-Off in a Mobility Scenario**
- **Nodes:**
  - Three VINI nodes located at Berkeley, California Tech, and MIT.
  - Communication between VINI nodes is established via UDP tunnels.
  - A Video Server is connected to the California Tech VINI node using an ORBIT node with bridge configuration.
  - Two access points, A and B, are attached to other VINI nodes and configured in router mode.
  - `ath0` interfaces on four ORBIT nodes are configured with `172.16.X.X` IP addresses.
  - `tap0/br0` interfaces are configured with `192.168.X.X` IP addresses.
  - OSPF is used to set up connectivity between nodes.

### 3.2 Experiment Execution
- **Initial Setup:**
  - Video is streamed from the Video Server to the Mobile Client through access point A.
- **Hand-Off Process:**
  - As the Mobile Client moves away from access point A, the connection breaks, and the video freezes.
  - Access point A senses the broken link and advertises the change via OSPF.
  - The Mobile Client establishes a new connection via access point B, which then advertises the new link.
  - Once the new routing information is propagated, the video is restored.

### 3.3 Comparison with Mobile IP
- In Mobile IP, access point A would relay packets to access point B after the hand-off.
- In this scenario, packets go directly from California Tech, MIT, and access point B to the Mobile Client, avoiding triangular routing.

## 4. Experimental Results
- **Packet Delay:**
  - With Mobile IP: 443 msecs
  - With our setup: 225 msecs
- **Routing Propagation Time:**
  - Approximately 3.5 seconds for new routes to propagate and restore the video.

**Figure 10: Throughput Characteristics of Received Video**
- **Throughput from Video Server to Mobile Client:**
  - At 50 Mbps offered load, the average throughput is 0.9 Mbps.
  - At 1 Mbps offered load, the average throughput is 0.975 Mbps.

### 4.1 OpenVPN Link Performance
- **Table 1: Throughput, Delay, and Jitter on OpenVPN Links**
  - **Access Point A to Berkeley:**
    - Throughput: 4.01 Mbps
    - Delay: 83 usec
    - Jitter: 3.0 usec
  - **Access Point B to MIT:**
    - Throughput: 4.25 Mbps
    - Delay: 99 usec
    - Jitter: 2.9 usec
  - **Server Bridge to California Tech:**
    - Throughput: 1.25 Mbps
    - Delay: 19 usec
    - Jitter: 7.5 usec

## 5. Discussion
- **Integration Lessons:**
  - The use of Ethernet tunnels instead of IP tunnels supports non-IP protocols and broadcast packets.
  - VINI provides a powerful platform but requires detailed knowledge of its inner workings.
  - Transparency in the integrated testbed allows users with basic Linux networking knowledge to deploy experiments without needing to understand lower layers of virtualization.
- **Performance Considerations:**
  - Virtualization on PlanetLab nodes incurs additional overhead.
  - ORBIT nodes have two wireless interfaces, allowing potential support for two concurrent experiments per node.
  - Spatial division of the ORBIT grid ensures each experiment gets a portion of the wireless nodes.

## 6. Conclusion
This paper presents an integrated architecture that enables network layer experiments over wired and wireless networks, providing an abstraction of the underlying software architecture. The solution simplifies experiment setup, supports non-IP traffic, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the design through a video hand-off experiment as an alternative to Mobile IP.
