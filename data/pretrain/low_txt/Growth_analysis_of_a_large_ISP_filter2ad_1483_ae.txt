### 5.3 Network Evolution

Finally, we analyze the inferred graph of Cogent’s network. While passively collecting Cogent’s reverse DNS records each week provides us with a detailed list of interfaces, these records do not explicitly indicate connections between routers. Therefore, we use the following procedure to infer the network topology:

1. **Interface Pair Identification**: We observe that connected routers must have interfaces on a shared subnet. Similar to the Sidecar approach [23], we collect candidate pairs of interfaces whose IP addresses appear to share a /30 subnet (the addresses must be off-by-one, and the inferred network and broadcast addresses must be valid and not assigned to other interfaces).

2. **Physical Interface Filtering**: We conservatively consider only candidate pairs where both interfaces are physical and of the same type.

3. **Graph Inference**: Finally, we construct the network graph by connecting the identified interface pairs.

**Figure 6** visualizes paths in Cogent’s network based on data from the week of April 7, 2013. Nodes represent routers, edges link routers sharing the same IP subnet, and nodes are scaled to represent betweenness—larger nodes have a greater number of paths passing through them. The layout is force-directed and does not include geographical information.

We hope that releasing the complete record of our weekly probes will be interesting and relevant to the research community. While this paper provides an extensive verification of our measurement approach and an initial analysis of the dynamics within Cogent’s own routers, we believe additional analyses, such as those of Cogent’s peers and customers, or of the occasional DNS anomalies experienced by our more than one billion queries, could be possible. Combining this dataset with others, such as those gathered by the iPlane project [19] or CAIDA, could also be fruitful avenues for further research.
