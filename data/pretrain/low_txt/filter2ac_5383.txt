**ATT&CK ID:** T1136.002  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Domain Account

Adversaries may create a domain account to maintain persistent access to victim systems. Domain accounts are managed by Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and provide access and permissions across all systems and services within the domain. These accounts can be user, administrator, or service accounts. With sufficient privileges, an adversary can use the `net user /add /domain` command to create a new domain account, thereby establishing a foothold in the network.

### Key Points:
- **Purpose:** Maintain persistent access.
- **Account Types:** User, administrator, and service accounts.
- **Creation Method:** `net user /add /domain` command with appropriate privileges.
- **Management:** Managed by Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).
- **Scope:** Access and permissions configured across the entire domain.
