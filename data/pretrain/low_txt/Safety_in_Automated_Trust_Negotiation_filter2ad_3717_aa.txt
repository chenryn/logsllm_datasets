## Abstract
The exchange of attribute credentials is a method for establishing mutual trust between parties wishing to share resources or conduct business transactions. Automated Trust Negotiation (ATN) regulates the exchange of sensitive information by treating credentials as protected resources, with access controlled by policies. Prior work on ATN lacks a clear and adequate definition of safety, leading to significant security vulnerabilities. This paper introduces a formal framework for ATN that provides precise, usable, and intuitive definitions of policy enforcement. We argue that our primary safety notion captures essential security goals. We compare this notion with two alternative safety concepts, demonstrating their inadequacies. We also prove that an existing ATN approach from the literature meets the requirements of our preferred safety definition, thereby validating its security and the practicality of our definition.

## 1. Introduction
In Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) systems, access control decisions are based on attributes of requesters, such as roles, rights, licenses, or personal details, often documented by digitally signed credentials. A principal proves possession of an attribute by presenting relevant credentials. Since these attributes can be sensitive, they need protection. Automated Trust Negotiation (ATN) enables resource requesters and access mediators to establish trust through cautious, iterative, bilateral disclosure of credentials. Unlike other trust establishment schemes, ATN treats credentials themselves as protected resources.

Prior work on ATN lacks a robust notion of security, failing to adequately address fundamental questions such as "what needs to be protected in ATN?" and "what are the security requirements?". This paper aims to provide a formal ATN framework with precise and appropriate security definitions. 

### 1.1 Deficiencies in Existing Definitions
Most ATN frameworks define safety as ensuring that each disclosed credential is unlocked according to the access control (AC) policy. However, this simple requirement is insufficient for protecting the privacy of sensitive attributes. Several researchers have noted that early ATN designs, while satisfying AC policies, fail to protect negotiators' privacy. For example, a negotiator's behavior can reveal whether they possess a sensitive attribute, even if the attribute itself is not transmitted. This leads to the compromise of private information.

### 1.2 Eager Strategy and Ack Policies
One ATN strategy that avoids this issue is the eager strategy, where each party transmits all credentials whose AC policies have been satisfied. While this strategy prevents revealing sensitive attributes, it is impractical for many scenarios as it does not focus on relevant credentials.

In previous work, an approach using acknowledgement policies (ack policies) was proposed to focus the credential exchange while protecting sensitive attributes. An ack policy is associated with an attribute rather than a credential, allowing one to provide the policy without indicating whether they satisfy the attribute. This approach aims to prevent an opponent from learning whether a negotiator possesses an attribute without first satisfying its ack policy. However, the intuitive notion of safe enforcement of ack policies was not formally defined, making it impossible to prove the safety of strategies using ack policies.

### 1.3 Goals and Contributions
This paper aims to provide a precise, usable, and intuitive definition of safe enforcement of ack policies. The definition should enable the proof of safety for negotiation strategies and fulfill expectations of protecting sensitive attributes. The contributions of this paper include:
1. A formal framework for trust negotiation and a precise definition of safety for enforcement of ack policies.
2. Proof that the eager strategy is safe based on this formal definition.
3. A formal analysis of the relationship between our safety definition and two alternative definitions.
4. An analysis showing why our safety definition is preferable to the alternatives.
5. A family of strategies based on the Trust Target Graph (TTG) protocol that supports flexibility in negotiation.
6. Proof that all strategies in this family are safe according to the formal definition.
7. A precise definition of safety for AC policies that can be used with cryptographic ATN protocols.

- Section 2 discusses why previous notions of safety are inadequate.
- Section 3 presents the formal framework and safety definitions.
- Section 4 reviews the TTG protocol and presents the family of safe strategies.
- Section 5 discusses deficiencies in previous safety definitions for AC policies and provides our new definition.
- Section 6 discusses related work.

- The appendix contains proofs of theorems.

## 2. Prior Unsatisfactory Notions of Safety
Most existing negotiation strategies are considered safe according to the limited definitions provided by their designers. However, they do not adequately protect the content of credentials, which is the central goal of ATN. If credential content did not need protection, requesters could simply push all their credentials to the access mediator for evaluation. This highlights the need for a more robust definition of safety.

### 2.1 Limitations of Current Definitions
Current definitions of safety in ATN, such as the one given in Yu et al. [2003], are insufficient. They state that a sequence of disclosures is safe if each disclosed credential is unlocked at the time of disclosure. This definition fails to account for the privacy implications of a negotiator's behavior, which can reveal sensitive information. For example, a negotiator's response to a request can indicate whether they possess a sensitive attribute, even if the attribute itself is not transmitted.

### 2.2 Example of Inadequate Protection
Consider a scenario where a negotiator is asked to prove a sensitive attribute. The negotiator's behavior, such as the timing and nature of their responses, can reveal whether they possess the attribute. This compromises the privacy of the attribute, even if the attribute itself is not transmitted. Ad hoc solutions, such as pretending not to have the attribute, are impractical and undermine the trust negotiation process.

### 2.3 Need for a Robust Definition
To address these issues, a more robust definition of safety is needed. This definition should ensure that a negotiator's behavior does not reveal sensitive information about their attributes unless the opponent has satisfied the corresponding ack policy. This requires a formal framework that can capture the nuances of ATN and provide a precise, usable, and intuitive definition of safety.

## 3. Formal Framework and Safety Definitions
This section introduces a formal framework for ATN and provides precise, usable, and intuitive definitions of safety for the enforcement of ack policies.

### 3.1 Formalization of ATN
We formalize the ability of an adversary to distinguish between one negotiator and another. For each negotiator \( N \) and each adversary \( M \), there is a set \( U \) of attributes whose ack policies are not satisfied by \( M \). A strategy is defined as safe if any other negotiator \( N' \) who differs from \( N \) only in credentials proving attributes in \( U \) is indistinguishable from \( N \) by \( M \) based on ATN.

### 3.2 Comparison with Alternative Definitions
We compare our safety definition with two alternative definitions that capture similar but different intuitions about safety. We show that these alternatives are strictly weaker and inadequate in various respects. Our safety notions have important similarities to the concepts of noninterference [Goguen and Meseguer 1982] and nondeducibility [Sutherland 1986].

### 3.3 Proof of Safety for Eager Strategy
We prove that the eager strategy, where each party transmits all credentials whose AC policies have been satisfied, is safe according to our formal definition. This validates the security of the eager strategy and the practicality of our safety definition.

## 4. Trust Target Graph (TTG) Protocol and Safe Strategies
This section reviews the Trust Target Graph (TTG) protocol and presents a family of strategies that support flexibility in negotiation while ensuring safety.

### 4.1 Review of TTG Protocol
The TTG protocol, introduced in Winsborough and Li [2002b], focuses the credential exchange while protecting sensitive attributes. It uses ack policies to prevent an opponent from learning whether a negotiator possesses an attribute without first satisfying its ack policy.

### 4.2 Family of Safe Strategies
We present a family of strategies based on the TTG protocol that support flexible search for a successful negotiation. These strategies ensure that a negotiator's behavior does not reveal sensitive information about their attributes unless the opponent has satisfied the corresponding ack policy.

### 4.3 Proof of Safety for TTG Strategies
We prove that all strategies in this family are safe according to our formal definition. This validates both the usability of the definition and the design of the TTG framework.

## 5. Safety Definitions for AC Policies
This section discusses the deficiencies of previous safety definitions for AC policies and provides a new, precise definition.

### 5.1 Deficiencies of Previous Definitions
Previous definitions of safety for AC policies, such as the one given in Yu et al. [2003], are insufficient because they do not adequately protect the content of credentials. These definitions focus on ensuring that each disclosed credential is unlocked according to the AC policy but fail to account for the privacy implications of a negotiator's behavior.

### 5.2 New Definition of Safety for AC Policies
We provide a new, precise definition of safety for AC policies that can be used with cryptographic ATN protocols. This definition ensures that no information about the content of credentials is leaked unless the AC policy for the credential is satisfied. This definition is more robust and addresses the limitations of previous definitions.

## 6. Related Work
This section discusses related work in the field of ATN and compares our approach with existing methods.

### 6.1 Comparison with Other Approaches
We compare our approach with other trust establishment schemes, such as those proposed by Bonatti and Samarati [2000] and Herzberg et al. [2000]. These approaches do not treat credentials as protected resources, making them less suitable for protecting sensitive information. We also discuss the similarities and differences between our safety notions and the concepts of noninterference and nondeducibility.

## 7. Conclusion
This paper introduces a formal framework for ATN and provides precise, usable, and intuitive definitions of safety for the enforcement of ack policies. We prove that the eager strategy and a family of strategies based on the TTG protocol are safe according to our formal definition. We also provide a new, precise definition of safety for AC policies. These contributions validate the security and practicality of our definitions and the design of the TTG framework.

### Future Work
Future work will focus on extending the framework to accommodate diverse credential systems and exploring the application of our safety definitions to other trust negotiation scenarios.
