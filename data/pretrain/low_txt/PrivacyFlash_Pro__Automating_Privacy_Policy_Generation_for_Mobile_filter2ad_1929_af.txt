### Appendix

#### A. Legal Requirements for Privacy Policies

The following privacy policy requirements are covered by PrivacyFlash Pro and, where indicated, by the examined questionnaire-based generators. Omission or incorrect disclosure can be considered an unfair or deceptive act or practice [15 USC §45].

- **COPPA Requirements:**

  - Description of the operator’s collection, use, and disclosure practices [§312.4(d)(2)]
  - Description of whether the site or service enables a child to make personal information publicly available [§312.4(d)(2)]
  - Statement that a parent can review, have deleted, and refuse to permit further collection or use of the child’s personal information and procedures for doing so [§312.4(d)(3)]

- **GDPR Requirements:**
  - Identity and contact details of the data controller and their representative, if any [Art. 13(1)(a), 14(1)(a)]

  - Existence of the rights to request data access, rectification, erasure, and data portability as well as the rights to restrict and object to processing [Art. 13(2)(b), 14(2)(c)]
  - Right to withdraw consent for processing at any time [Art. 13(2)(c), 14(2)(d)]
  - Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority [Art. 13(2)(d), 14(2)(e)]

- **CalOPPA Requirements:**
  - Identify categories of personally identifiable information collected and categories of third parties with whom it is shared [§22575(b)(1)]
  - If the operator maintains a process to review and request changes to personally identifiable information, provide a description of that process [§22575(b)(2)]
  - Description of the process by which consumers are notified of material changes to the operator’s privacy policy [§22575(b)(3)]
  - Identify the policy’s effective date [§22575(b)(4)]

#### C. Improvement Suggestions from the iOS Developer Community

We received the following responses to our question “How could we improve PrivacyFlash Pro?” in the usability survey:

1. No suggestion (16)
2. Implement PrivacyFlash Pro as a native desktop app (6)
3. Improve the UI/UX (e.g., the color scheme or toggle switches) (4)
4. Add support for multiple policy file formats (e.g., Word and PDF) (3)
5. Be more transparent about what is being done with the source code during the analysis (3)
6. Make the tooltips more specific, extensive, or explain more of the law (2)
7. Add to the third-party library analysis more details on what they are doing and what their risks are (2)
8. Implement PrivacyFlash Pro as a web app for analyzing code repositories online (2)
9. Allow developers to manually include or exclude files or directories from the analysis (2)

#### D. Comments from the iOS Developer Community

We received the following comments from study participants via the Upwork chat [72] or email. Additional comments were provided on Reddit’s r/iOSProgramming [57] where we solicited participants for our study. Neither comment was prompted for.

1. "Thanks for this awesome application, very helpful"
2. "As a developer, I am very pleased to use PrivacyFlash Pro."
3. "It is great. Awesome work I am really impressed."
4. "I found [PrivacyFlash Pro] very useful for future purpose [sic]."
5. "I’ll use the application while developing iOS apps. It is great."
6. "This tool is amazing! Congratulations. I really mean that."
7. "I do really like Privacy Flash Pro"
8. "Your project is very interesting, but honestly, I have never written the privacy info myself. But I realize how to make privacy doc easily. If I need to write [...], I will recommend using your program."
9. "It is quite useful"
10. "Neat tool you got there. It would be awesome to have something similar for GDPR too. One thing tho, for the flags, in my opinion, it’s a bit confusing to add/remove any flags. I got a flag for a 3rd party lib, but it was a bit misleading on how to remove it. Anyway, congrats on the cool tool and good luck!"
11. "Overall it was very easy to use your app for creating privacy policy."
12. "Really cool thing for Privacy Policy creation"
13. "I’ll give it a try when I will release a personal project in about 4 weeks. It’s a good tool, but in the past when I released a large number of apps under my name, I did not pay so much attention to the privacy policy. I was just using a template."
14. "I’ve found your app very useful. It is really easy to use."
15. "I just expected it to run as a native app instead of opening a browser. Anyways, seems like a really cool app, congratulations. I will return to it if I ever need a new privacy policy."
16. "Awesome tool, helps to avoid routine work."
17. "I like this product and idea itself. I did not create many policies by myself but I’ve never heard/used something like your product. It can save a lot of time and help many people, I think."
18. "I like your product, and will consider using it in the future."
19. "Thanks for letting me know about PrivacyFlash Pro software, it can really help every Swift developer out there."
20. "This looks awesome! Well done. Looking forward to giving this a try on a project I’m working on soon." [r/iOSProgramming]
21. "[Author name], congratulations to you and your team for the great work! PFP looks (and acts) more like a commercial product than a research prototype :)" [r/iOSProgramming]
22. "Saved this one for later. I cancelled working on my first app because of privacy policies" [r/iOSProgramming]
23. "This is pretty cool! Would it be possible to skip the code analysis and allow for creating a privacy policy by just filling out the questionnaire? I currently use Termly and I’d love to switch over to this and host it myself. Good job, y’all!" [r/iOSProgramming]
24. "This is really cool! Are there any plans for React Native support?" [r/iOSProgramming]

**Note:** GDPR provisions are included in PrivacyFlash Pro.
