### Electron Version
13.1.1

### Operating System
Windows 10 Pro, Version 2004

### Architecture
x64

### Last Known Working Electron Version
11.3.0

### Expected Behavior
The `navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice({ acceptAllDevices: true })` method should scan for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices and return them. This functionality works as expected on macOS.

### Actual Behavior
On Windows, the `navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice({ acceptAllDevices: true })` method does not return any devices and continues scanning indefinitely. This issue is specific to Windows, as the same code works correctly on macOS.
