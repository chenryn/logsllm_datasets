**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Overview:**
The Network Load Balancing Manager (NLBMgr) allows you to configure and manage Network Load Balancing (NLB) clusters and all cluster hosts from a single computer. Additionally, you can use this tool to replicate the cluster configuration to other hosts.

**Starting NLBMgr:**
You can start the Network Load Balancing Manager from the command line using the `nlbmgr.exe` command. This executable is located in the `systemroot\System32` folder.

**Syntax:**
```plaintext
nlbmgr [/noping] [/hostlist <filename>] [/autorefresh <interval>] [/help | /?]
```

**Parameters:**

- **/noping**
  - **Description:** Prevents the Network Load Balancing Manager from pinging the hosts before attempting to contact them through Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). Use this option if you have disabled Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) on all available network adapters.
  - **Note:** If the manager attempts to contact a host that is not available, you may experience a delay when using this option.

- **/hostlist <filename>**
  - **Description:** Loads the hosts specified in the provided file into the Network Load Balancing Manager.
  - **Usage Example:** `nlbmgr /hostlist C:\hosts.txt`

- **/autorefresh <interval>**
  - **Description:** Causes the Network Load Balancing Manager to refresh its host and cluster information every `<interval>` seconds. If no interval is specified, the information is refreshed every 60 seconds by default.
  - **Usage Example:** `nlbmgr /autorefresh 30`

- **/help or /?**
  - **Description:** Displays help information at the command prompt.
  - **Usage Example:** `nlbmgr /help`

By using these parameters, you can effectively manage and configure your NLB clusters and hosts, ensuring optimal performance and availability.
