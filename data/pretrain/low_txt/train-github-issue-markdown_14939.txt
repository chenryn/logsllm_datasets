When I run the command `flutter run`, I encounter the following error:

```
Launching lib/main.dart on iPhone 5s in debug mode...
[VERBOSE-1:callback_cache.cc(132)] Could not parse callback cache, aborting restore
```

This issue is related to the project located at [https://github.com/syfgkjasdkn/flutter_view_swift](https://github.com/syfgkjasdkn/flutter_view_swift).

For additional context, here are the results of running `flutter doctor -v`:

The `flutter doctor` output indicates that my development environment is set up correctly, but the error persists when running the Flutter app on the iPhone 5s simulator.
