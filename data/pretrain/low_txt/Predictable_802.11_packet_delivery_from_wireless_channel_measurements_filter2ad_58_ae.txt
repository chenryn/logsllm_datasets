### Performance Evaluation

The system performs excellently, although it is below the OPT (Optimal) benchmark. However, it consistently overlaps with Previous-OPT, which serves as an upper bound for schemes that track the channel and do not predict future conditions. The Effective Signal-to-Noise Ratio (ESNR) is accurate for 75% of packets, with the expected 10% target over-selection.

### Mobility Impact on SISO Channels

**Figure 9: OPT and ESNR SISO Performance in Human-Speed Mobility**

**Figure 10: OPT and ESNR SISO Performance in Fast Mobile Channels**

These figures illustrate the effects of mobility on Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) channels. Each plot shows the average data rate as a function of the speed at which the trace is played. We cover a wide range of speeds, from 1× (walking speed, approximately 3 mph) to 128× (over 300 mph), in doubling increments. All schemes exhibit a decline in performance with increasing speed. The gap between OPT and Previous-OPT widens from 20% at human speeds to 33% at the fastest speeds. Despite this, ESNR maintains its performance, staying within 10% of Previous-OPT even in highly mobile environments.

### Comparison with Other Schemes

**Figure 11: ESNR, SampleRate, and SoftRate SISO Performance in Human-Speed Mobility**

**Figure 12: OPT, ESNR, SampleRate, and SoftRate SISO Performance in Fast Mobile Channels**

In these comparisons, ESNR slightly outperforms SampleRate, which in turn slightly outperforms SoftRate at 1× speed. These results were unexpected, as SampleRate performed better than anticipated, while SoftRate underperformed. 

- **SampleRate**: Its lagging channel estimate causes it to degrade faster with increased mobility. However, it maintains a 10–25% margin over ESNR, performing well even at high speeds. Dropping the rate on retry is a key factor in its short-term adaptability. Without this fallback, its performance drops by 25–50%.
  
- **SoftRate**: It has one of the slowest performance declines with increasing mobility due to its direct and accurate channel measurements. At maximum speed, it performs the best. However, at slower speeds, it is slightly slower on average than SampleRate, though it outperforms SampleRate without the fallback mechanism. Further tuning is expected to improve SoftRate's performance.

### MIMO Performance

**Figure 13: OPT and ESNR MIMO Performance in Human-Speed Mobility**

**Figure 14: OPT and ESNR MIMO Performance in Faster Mobile Channels**

To demonstrate the generality of our model, we show the performance of an unmodified ESNR algorithm for 802.11n Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) rates. These results exclude SampleRate and SoftRate, which are SISO schemes. Instead, we use OPT as the benchmark. The trends in these graphs are similar to those in the SISO graphs:

- At human mobility speeds, ESNR closely tracks Previous-OPT, delivering excellent performance with 80% accuracy and 10% over-selection.
- In faster mobile channels, the gap between ESNR and Previous-OPT is slightly larger for MIMO than for SISO, likely due to the increased number of rates (24 for MIMO vs. 8 for SISO). ESNR is more likely to choose rates below the highest feasible rate.

### Enhancements

Our model's strength lies in its ability to accommodate additional functionalities without increasing complexity. For example, we demonstrated an enhancement to trim excess transmit power in Section 5. Another enhancement is the selection of the best transmit antenna when there are spare antennas. An 802.11n Access Point (AP) can select antennas to send packets to a legacy 802.11a/g client, using all antennas to receive packets. With three antennas, the expected gain in SNR is around 2.5 dB, often enough to advance to a higher rate. A version of SISO ESNR that chose the antenna with the highest ESNR achieved a 5% increase in the average rate, compared to a 10% increase by OPT.

### Related Work

Several studies have investigated the performance characteristics of 802.11. Initial studies found Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) to be a weak predictor of packet delivery, which improved with calibration for thermal conditions and manufacturing variability. Today’s Network Interface Cards (NICs) have intensive calibration procedures that largely eliminate these issues. However, the variation across links with 802.11a/g/n Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) comes from frequency-selective fading, which does not affect spread-spectrum modulations in 802.11b.

### Conclusion

Wireless links are straightforward in theory but challenging in practice, necessitating search algorithms to find optimal rates, power levels, and other parameters. We present a practical 802.11 packet delivery model that simplifies this situation. Our model uses Channel State Information (CSI) to predict whether a link will deliver packets for various NIC configurations. It employs the concept of effective SNR to handle OFDM over faded links, works for MIMO configurations, and requires no calibration of target links. We evaluated our model with Intel 802.11a/g/n NICs, showing that it accurately predicts link performance over a wide range of rates, transmit power, spatial streams, and antenna settings. Our model is simple, easy to deploy, and general, applicable to both 802.11n (MIMO) and 802.11a/g (SISO) systems.
