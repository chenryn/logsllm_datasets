### Certificate and Policy Management in Agent Systems

**Certificate Assignment:**
- **Attribute Certificates:** These certificates are assigned to a specific agent and clearly identify the subject, which is the agent granted certain privileges.
- **Policy Certificates:** Unlike attribute certificates, policy certificates can apply to a broader range of subjects, such as multiple agent platforms within a domain. For instance, a policy certificate issued by a domain authority can be applicable to all agent platforms within that domain. This multi-platform policy allocation can be achieved by using an appropriate entity name (e.g., a DNS domain name) for the certificate owner.

**Security Policy Application:**
- The platform administrator or security officer is responsible for applying the relevant policy certificates by setting configuration parameters. Policy certificates can be stored externally, provided that the storage location does not introduce security vulnerabilities.
- During initialization, an agent platform validates the policy certificates and applies the policy content either immediately or on demand.

**Privilege Management Certificates:**
- Privilege management certificates can be represented in various formats, typically using Abstract Syntax Notation 1 (ASN.1) Distinguished Encoding Rules. However, ASN.1 has limitations, such as not being human-readable and requiring specialized, non-widely available parsing tools.
- To address these issues, we use eXtended Markup Language (XML) for privilege management certificates. The XML representation closely follows the basic certificate structure, allowing for flexibility and ease of use.

**Policy Expression:**
- Policy expressions within privilege management certificates can be conveyed in different forms, such as:
  - **Matchmaker System:** Uses a complex form of policy expression via classified advertisements (classads) to broker services between providers and consumers. Classads support logical and arithmetic expressions.
  - **Policy Definition Language (PDL):** Developed by Koch et al., PDL specifies executable rules for automating management policies, supporting logical expressions as preconditions for management actions.
  - **IETFâ€™s Security Policy Specification Language (SPSL):** Specialized for security and Internet communications, SPSL follows PDL in functionality, focusing on the protection of communications.

**Policy-Setting Principals:**
- **Branding Principals:** Entities involved in attesting to the characteristics of the agent's code, such as the manufacturer, evaluator, or owner.
- **Using Principals:** Individuals or organizations on whose behalf the agent operates, causing the agent to be launched. Typically, there is one using principal per agent, but multiple users may be involved in some scenarios.
- **Hosting Principals:** Entities with resource authorization control over the agent platform, such as system administrators, security officers, or domain authorization authorities.

**Certificate Issuance:**
- Hosting principals issue policy certificates, while branding and using principals issue attribute certificates. The latter may include additional information specific to the agent instance.
- Figure 3 illustrates the certificate assignment process, showing how different types of principals issue different types of certificates.

**Delegation and Authorization Chains:**
- Privilege management certificates can involve chains of delegation, where the privileges of an issued certificate are derived from those held by the issuer. This allows for flexible authorization styles, from push-style (where a policy-setting principal first gains privileges before allocating them to an agent) to pull-style (where visited platforms contact an authorization authority to confirm the legitimacy of the agent's privileges).

**Policy Processing:**
- An agent carries its attribute certificates as it moves between platforms. The platform processes these certificates to determine the agent's security context.
- The policy processing mechanism is divided into two parts: the outer policy engine and the inner policy engine.
  - **Outer Policy Engine:** Responsible for parsing, verifying, and validating the certificates, including handling certificate chains and ordering attribute certificates based on policy precedence.
  - **Inner Policy Engine:** Determines the security context for the agent at the platform by processing the validated attribute certificates against the platform policy.

**Java-Based Agent Systems:**
- Many agent systems are implemented using the Java programming language, which supports features such as code mobility, dynamic code downloading, digitally signed code, remote method invocation, object serialization, and platform heterogeneity.

This approach provides a flexible and robust framework for managing security policies in agent systems, ensuring that the necessary security and operational requirements are met.
