# Technical Changes Since the Last Tor Talk

## Speaker: Nick Mathewson, The Tor Project
### Event: Defcon XV
#### Date: August 4, 2007

### Introduction
- **Tor in 2004 (v0.0.7.2):**
  - Functioning and seemingly secure.
  - Small network.
  - No graphical user interface (GUI), making it difficult to use.
  - Presented at a couple of Defcon talks.

- **Current State (v0.2.0.4-alpha):**
  - **Security:** Adding features and fixing security bugs.
  - **Scalability:** Challenges in adding and using capacity.
  - **Usability:** Improving GUIs and fixing bugs.
  - **Integration:** Enhancing compatibility with other applications.
  - **Other Updates:** Refer to the changelog for more details.
  - **Network Growth:** Approximately 200,000 users and 1,000 servers.

### Outline
1. **Prelude: Brief Introduction to Tor**
2. **Directories and Server Discovery Changes: More Secure and Scalable**
3. **Path Generation Changes: More Efficient and Less Filling**
4. **Circuit-Building Protocol Changes: Cryptography is Challenging**
5. **New Tools and Features: Simplifying User Experience**

### Prelude: Introduction to Anonymity and Tor
- **Anonymity Networks:** Hide users among other users.
- **Tor Network:**
  - Consists of multiple servers connected via TLS (SSL).
  - Clients build circuits through a network of decrypting relays.
  - Circuits are used to relay multiple TCP streams.
  - Traffic patterns can be correlated by hostile nodes, but there is no simple, fast fix.

### I. Directories and Server Discovery
- **Challenges:**
  - Every client must know every server.
  - All clients must have the same server list.
  - Servers should not impersonate each other.
  - Bandwidth is a critical factor.

- **Historical Approach (2004):**
  - Each authority published a large list of server information, which was slow.
  - Caches were added to improve performance but introduced new risks.

- **Current Approach (2007):**
  - Split directory into status (signed) and individual descriptors.
  - Authorities vote on a single consensus status document.
  - Descriptors are named and requested by digest to prevent attacks.
  - Authorities provide detailed information about servers, such as stability, speed, and roles.

### II. Path Generation
- **2004:**
  - All servers were chosen with equal probability, leading to underutilized large servers and overloaded small ones.

- **Current Approach:**
  - Bandwidth is considered, so selection is not uniform.
  - Unstable servers are used for short-lived connections.
  - Long-lived servers are used for long-lived connections.
  - Guard nodes are used to provide long-term anonymity.
  - Predictive circuit building based on past behavior and unused circuit cannibalization for faster response.

### III. Circuit-Building Protocol
- **Old Method:**
  - Extend by IP:Port was insufficient due to incomplete server knowledge.
  - Using only identity keys created man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack opportunities.
  - Encrypted create cell for the first hop was unnecessary.

- **New Method:**
  - Use both identity key and IP.
  - Check for bad values of g^x and g^y.
  - Ian Goldberg's proof of security after these checks.
  - OpenSSL patches applied.

### IV. New Tools and Features
- **Old Solution:**
  - Everyone had to use SOCKS, which was cumbersome.
  - Solutions like Privoxy and polipo were not ideal.
  - Windows and macOS had limited support.

- **Current Solutions:**
  - TransPort and iptables/pf support any TCP application.
  - Virtual machines (e.g., JanusVM) can be used as routers.
  - Tor acts as a DNS server to handle .onion addresses and prevent DNS leaks.
  - External GUIs (e.g., Vidalia, TorK) simplify configuration.

### Conclusion and Next Steps
- **Try Tor:**
