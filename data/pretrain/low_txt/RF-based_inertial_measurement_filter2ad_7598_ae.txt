### Various Industrial Applications
RIM (Radio Frequency-based Inertial Measurement) has a wide range of industrial applications, such as tracking carts and machines. 

### Packet Loss
Ideally, uniformly sampled Channel State Information (CSI) provides the best performance for RIM. In practice, RIM can tolerate packet loss to a certain extent through interpolation. However, a relatively clean channel is essential to ensure optimal performance.

### Angle Resolution
Currently, RIM utilizes discrete directions defined by the antenna array (e.g., 30° resolution with a 6-antenna uniform circular array). Notably, the Time-Reversed Resonance Spectrum (TRRS) decreases differently with respect to various deviation angles. This suggests that finer-granularity directions in continuous space could be explored by leveraging the geometric relationship of adjacent antenna pairs.

### Limitation of Rotating Angle
The current prototype of RIM can only sense in-place rotation with coarse resolution and cannot monitor the rotating angle of swinging turns (i.e., moving while turning). Further research is needed to explore more general and accurate angular motion measurement based on RIM. Although we have demonstrated the ability to track movements during turns by integrating inertial sensors in §6.3.3, it is interesting to investigate simultaneous translational and rotational motions using RIM alone.

### 3D Motion
While RIM achieves better precision and robustness, it cannot measure 3D motion like traditional inertial sensors. Building a specialized 3D array could overcome this limitation, which may be impractical in some scenarios but valuable for special-purpose applications like drone tracking. Incorporating existing techniques such as WiBall [46], which is also based on TRRS, may offer (less accurate) distance estimation in arbitrary directions without the need for a 3D array. The 3D direction remains an open area for future research.

### Fusing Inertial Sensors
RIM enhances inertial measurements, particularly for distance and heading estimation, which are challenging for traditional inertial sensors. Gyroscopes provide high accuracy for rotating angles, and magnetometers report absolute orientation. Given that inertial sensors are often present alongside WiFi radios, fusing them with RIM is a promising direction. This fusion can both calibrate inertial sensors and incorporate them into RIM, thereby enhancing ubiquitous inertial measurements for applications such as indoor tracking and virtual reality.

### Related Works
Related works fall into two main areas: wireless tracking and sensing, and inertial sensing.

#### Wireless Tracking and Sensing
Numerous efforts have been devoted to wireless tracking and sensing over the past decades. Many existing works use different channel parameters for tracking, such as Angle of Arrival (AoA) [13, 15, 43], Time of Flight (ToF) [9, 29], or their fusion [26, 41]. The latest approaches, such as [14], achieve sub-centimeter accuracy. These methods, however, typically require a large phased array or a large frequency bandwidth, along with clear Line of Sight (LOS) conditions, to perform well. Efforts to expand bandwidth by frequency hopping [35, 40] and extend antenna arrays [42] have been made, but they incur extra spectrum or hardware overhead. Additionally, many existing works require cooperation across multiple Access Points (APs) [13, 15, 43]. Some proposals attempt to track using a single AP, but they still need precise AP location and orientation [29, 35] or achieve decimeter accuracy [46]. Moreover, many of these works degrade or fail in Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) conditions. In contrast, RIM is truly multipath-resilient, providing centimeter-level motion tracking even in complex NLOS scenarios, and resolving direction simultaneously, using only a single arbitrarily placed AP without any prior information.

Other works leverage fingerprinting of dense APs [1, 27, 30]. [25] uses Channel Impulse Response (CIR) for movement detection but does not address motion tracking. Centimeter granularity fingerprinting using CIR [39] has been enhanced by multiple antennas [5] and frequency hopping [4]. [37] leverages multipath profiles of RFID channel parameters for fine-grained fingerprinting. These proposals require exhaustive calibration before deployment and deteriorate due to temporal dynamics. Unlike these, RIM does not need any calibration. [38] tracks orientation with an array of RFID tags, relying on precise phase difference of arrival, but does not address moving distance. [31] uses phase profiles to determine the relative order of RFID tags but does not solve relative distances or directions. The emerging 802.11mc [11] and Bluetooth 5.1 [34] standards provide Round Trip Time and AoA measurement, respectively, but offer limited accuracy, especially in indoor environments.

#### Inertial Sensing
Inertial sensing and its applications have been widely studied in aerodynamics, robotics, and mobile computing [6, 19, 28, 32, 44]. Various algorithms have been proposed to efficiently fuse data from accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers [2, 22]. For mobile and wearable devices, the state-of-the-art orientation is achieved by A3 [47] and MUSE [33]. Tracking moving distance with inertial sensors is more challenging. Prior works only track coarse-grained inertial distance for short-time motion by counting steps and estimating step lengths [36, 44]. Low-cost inertial sensors are generally unable to track precise distance, for which RIM offers a superior complement. Inertial sensors have also been used for activity recognition and classification, and we envision that RIM will enhance these capabilities. We note that RIM is particularly complementary to conventional inertial sensors, and we envision comprehensive fusion in the future.

Many other modalities, including computer vision [7, 24], visible light [16, 20], and acoustic sensing [21, 45], can also track the location of objects. These technologies usually require special infrastructure or are vulnerable to dynamic ambient contexts, making them less favorable for ubiquitous motion measurements. They do not resolve multiple inertial parameters either.

### Conclusion
This paper presents RIM, a precise inertial measurement system that estimates centimeter-level moving distance, heading direction, and rotating angle using commercial WiFi radios. It operates over a large multipath-rich area covered by a single unknown AP, without the need for additional infrastructure or sensors. By doing so, RIM opens up WiFi-based motion sensing to new applications requiring accurate and reliable motion measurements, such as robot monitoring, VR tracking, and mobile gaming. This work does not raise any ethical issues.
