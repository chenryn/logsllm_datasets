**Abstract:**

**1. Introduction**

Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a critical and complex task in IT processes, especially for large-scale cloud service providers like Salesforce. RCA typically involves analyzing data sources such as application error logs and service call traces. However, a rich source of root cause information is also hidden in the natural language documentation of past incident investigations by domain experts, known as Problem Review Board (PRB) Data. This data is a core component of IT Incident Management but is often not directly reusable due to its unstructured nature.

In this work, we focus on leveraging PRB Data to build an Incident Causation Analysis (ICA) engine using state-of-the-art (SoTA) neural Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The ICA engine extracts targeted information and constructs a structured Causal Knowledge Graph. This forms the backbone of a simple yet effective retrieval-based RCA system, which can search and rank past incidents to detect likely root causes based on the symptoms of new incidents.

We present the ICA and the downstream Incident Search and Retrieval-based RCA pipeline, built at Salesforce, over 2,000 documented cloud service incident investigations collected over several years. We also establish the effectiveness of ICA and the downstream tasks through various quantitative benchmarks, qualitative analysis, and validation by domain experts, including real incident case studies after deployment.

**2. Problem Setting and Motivation**

Our dataset consists of 2,000 PRB records from cloud service incidents with severity levels Sev0 (Catastrophic), Sev1 (Critical), and Sev2 (High Impact). The motivation for mining PRB data stems from the inadequacy of existing literature, which primarily focuses on mining knowledge from software logging data, execution traces, service call graphs, and time series data. While these works are valuable, they do not address the complexity and unstructured nature of PRB data.

**Motivation-1: Inadequate Prior Work**
Most RCA literature has focused on extracting usable knowledge from structured data sources such as software logs and execution traces. The closest related works [10, 12, 27] mine knowledge from incident descriptions or troubleshooting guides. However, these works focus on more straightforward tasks and simpler models, often with readily available training data. For example, [27] only tags named entities from incident descriptions using structured key-value pair data, while [12] recommends troubleshooting guides for incidents with parallel data to train Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. [10] performs bug triaging on structured bug-fix documents using non-neural and heuristic methods. These approaches do not require the detailed, targeted information needed for comprehensive RCA.

**Research Question:**
Can AI assist in ongoing incident analysis by extracting and mining relevant RCA information from past investigations and reusing this knowledge to quickly resolve repeating incidents?

**Primary Contributions:**
- **Incident Causation Analysis (ICA) Pipeline:** We propose an AI pipeline for ICA over past incident investigation data (PRB data), consisting of:
  - A targeted Neural NLP and Information Extraction system to extract key RCA information from each unstructured PRB.
  - A specialized Neural Knowledge Mining system to aggregate document-level information across all incidents into a domain-specific Causal Knowledge Graph.
