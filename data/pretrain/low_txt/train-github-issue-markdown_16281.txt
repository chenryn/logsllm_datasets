Subject: Issue with Dropdown Functionality on iPhone - Reference to #5180

Dear Team,

I am writing to follow up on issue #5180, which pertains to the functionality of dropdowns within pills and button dropdowns on my iPhone. While the dropdown menu opens correctly, selecting a menu item causes it to close instead of navigating to the intended page.

I wanted to inquire if this issue is scheduled to be addressed in the upcoming 2.1.2 release. If not, I will need to implement a workaround. My testing with the 2.1.2 work-in-progress (wip) version indicates that the problem persists.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,  
Lee
