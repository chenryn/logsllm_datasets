### Methodology and Findings

To identify potential vulnerabilities, we initiated an ICMP echo request to a public IP address under our control. We then searched for IP addresses that publicly exposed administrative services such as Telnet or SSH. This was achieved by checking for publicly routable loopbacks or services listening on routing interfaces. The process was easily automated since none of the open-source looking-glass software employ CAPTCHAs.

At the conclusion of our experiments, we identified a subset of vulnerable Autonomous Systems (ASes) where an attacker could potentially inject commands directly into the router or recover credentials required to log in through a publicly accessible interface.

We correlated this list of ASes with historical records of BGP announcements collected by RIPE RIS from various probes and peers worldwide. The results suggest that by compromising some of these ASes, an attacker could announce routes that would not be properly filtered by neighboring ASes.

We acknowledge that our methodology may result in several false negatives (URLs not in the original list, unavailable at the time of the experiment, or missed during fingerprinting) and a few false positives (updated and well-configured routers with proper ACLs). For the former, future experiments could be conducted to compare results. Unfortunately, it is impossible to eliminate false positives without performing real tests on the routers, which we could not do for ethical reasons.

### Results

After an initial fingerprinting phase, we collected 919 unique URLs of looking-glass applications, of which 220 were running one of the open-source software listed in Table 1. The remaining ones were either unreachable (184 cases) or running custom code we were unable to identify with our signatures (515).

#### Impacted ASes

An initial web search engine lookup revealed at least four configuration files crawled by indexing bots. Our findings are summarized in Table 3.

| Vulnerabilities | Affected ASes |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Exposed Configuration Files | 28 |
| Remote Command Injection | 12 |
| Misconfigured CGI | 4 |
| Exposed SSH Private Keys | 2 |

By examining default configuration paths for each software, we observed a large number of exposed credentials. At least 28 configuration files containing IPs and credentials can be directly downloaded by malicious attackers. In two cases, private SSH keys were also exposed on the web server.

#### Source Code Analysis

Our review of the source code revealed a general lack of basic security practices. None of the software used anti-automation mechanisms. The most concerning finding was a missing input sanitation mechanism, allowing arbitrary command injection to the router console (CVE-2014-3927 [19]). We also found three instances of insecure default paths and permissions, leading to the exposure of credentials (CVE-2014-3928 [20], CVE-2014-3929 [21], and CVE-2014-3930 [22]). In one case, the result page was vulnerable to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack (CVE-2014-3926 [23]).

On the host side, we discovered a remote memory corruption related to the parsing of ICMP-response fields in a bundled ping-like utility, intended to run as SUID on the looking-glass web server (CVE-2014-3931 [24]).

In total, we detected 46 vulnerable ASes that could be targeted by attackers to gain access to the Internet infrastructure. Figure 2 shows the geographical distribution of these ASes, with Russia having the highest number of vulnerable ASes (six), followed by Poland (four). However, none of these ASes are known tier-1 providers.

Using looking-glasses and network probes, we identified 53 routers across 20 ASes publicly exposing Telnet or SSH services. This figure excludes known public route servers, typically accessed over Telnet, which were filtered out.

By combining all the data, we correlated two leaked configurations to ASes whose router administration services were listening on routable IPs. We observed six routers connected to looking-glass instances that are directly reachable via Telnet and have publicly exposed credentials.

Overall, we identified at least 14 ASes highly interesting for attackers targeting the Internet infrastructure: 12 of them run software vulnerable to arbitrary command injection, while the remaining two have a largely exposed infrastructure.

### BGP Injection Feasibility

A malicious attacker capable of manipulating BGP sessions can affect network traffic globally. While several mechanisms exist to limit such issues, such as prefix filtering, past hijacks and academic studies have shown that BGP announcements are often not properly filtered, leading to misconfigurations and hijacks.

We analyzed historical data from RIPE RIS and spotted at least three cases where anomalous announcements were recorded by BGP collectors. In two cases, overlong prefixes (more specific than /24) were observed by multiple participating peers, and in the remaining case, an event lasting 8 hours occurred where one AS briefly announced an unrelated prefix already in use (a short multi-origin AS event, possibly due to a temporary misconfiguration).

These unfiltered prefixes suggest the possibility for a remote attacker to distribute bogus BGP routes by compromising one of the above ASes.

### Related Work

Backbone routers are critical for the Internet core infrastructure and have been studied from various perspectives. Remote exploitation of routers has been explored, with researchers focusing on Cisco IOS and Huawei VRP. Despite their importance, serious local flaws continue to be found, allowing attackers with console access to escalate privileges.

Researchers have also focused on BGP, the de facto interdomain routing protocol. The threat model involves taking control of a BGP device to announce false routes or hijack prefixes. Several solutions, including cryptography and anomaly detection, have been proposed but are not widely adopted by network providers.

Specific to looking-glass applications, past research has found vulnerabilities, but the focus was on code execution on the server running the looking-glass software. Some concerns about information leakage have been raised on public mailing lists, but no comprehensive studies have been conducted on this class of applications until now.

### Conclusions

Our study highlights the lack of uniform application of basic best practices by operators worldwide and how an attacker can target several ASes to disrupt the Internet with minimal effort. By analyzing public information and applying simple heuristics, we identified numerous attack surfaces in this critical infrastructure. We directly identified at least 45 exposed ASes, six routers across two ASes that could be remotely accessed via exposed credentials, and at least 12 additional ASes vulnerable to arbitrary command injection through the web interface. Additionally, we spotted unfiltered prefixes originating from at least three of these ASes in the past.
