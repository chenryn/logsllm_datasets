**Testimony of Paul Vixie, Chairman & CEO, Farsight Security, Inc.**

**Before the Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary**

**Hearing on: Taking Down Botnets: Public and Private Efforts to Disrupt and Dismantle Cybercriminal Networks**

**July 15, 2014**

**I. Introduction**

Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Graham, and Members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for inviting me to testify on the subject of botnet takedowns.

My name is Paul Vixie, and I am the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Farsight Security, a commercial Internet security company. I am testifying today in my personal capacity, drawing on my extensive experience in building and securing Internet infrastructure. Additionally, I represent the Messaging, Malware and Mobile Anti-Abuse Working Group (M3AAWG), a non-profit organization dedicated to enhancing global Internet security.

With over three decades of experience in the Internet industry, my background includes roles such as Chief Technology Officer at Abovenet/MFN, founder and CEO of MAPS (the first anti-spam company), and operator of the “F” DNS root name server. I have also been involved in Internet standards development through the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and policy work with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). Furthermore, I served on the board of trustees of ARIN, which manages Internet address resources in North America and parts of the Caribbean. Currently, I serve on the ICANN Security and Stability Advisory Committee (SSAC) and the Root Server System Advisory Committee (RSSAC). My contributions to DNS and BIND led to my induction into the Internet Hall of Fame earlier this year. My remarks today aim to promote improvements in botnet takedown efforts across non-profit, for-profit, and law enforcement sectors.

**II. Lessons from Conficker and Ghost Click**

To begin, I would like to review several successful botnet takedown efforts in recent years, as their commonalities may provide valuable insights.

**Conficker (2008-2009)**

In 2008, the Conficker worm was discovered, and by mid-2009, it had infected over ten million computers. I played a hands-on role in the data collection and measurement infrastructure for the takedown team. This effort saw unprecedented cooperation among competing commercial security companies, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and academic researchers, many of whom are M3AAWG members. The takedown required blocking or registering 50,000 domain names daily, spread across 110 different country-code top-level domains. Almost all registries cooperated, sharing technical and strategic plans.

**Operation Ghost Click (2011)**

In 2011, the U.S. Department of Justice led "Operation Ghost Click," resulting in the arrest and indictment of a criminal gang based in Estonia for wire fraud, computer intrusion, and conspiracy. The "DNS Changer" botnet affected at least 600,000 computers. My employer, Internet Systems Consortium (ISC), was appointed as the court receiver for the criminal's Internet resources. I personally prepared, installed, and operated the replacement DNS servers, ensuring that victims remained online while the criminal infrastructure was dismantled.

**Key Takeaways**

Both takedowns highlight the importance of ad-hoc public-private partnerships, where trust and credibility, rather than formal contracts, were the binding factors. These efforts exemplify modern multilateralism, where intent, competence, and merit guide the collaboration. Unilateral actions often lead to catastrophic outcomes due to the Internet's interdependent nature and unwritten operational rules.

**Privacy Considerations**

Protecting end-user privacy is paramount. In the Conficker takedown, victim data, including timestamps and IP addresses, was shared only on a need-to-know basis with responsible parties. Operation Ghost Click maintained even stricter privacy controls, with the court-appointed receiver collecting minimal data and directly delivering records to research and cleanup teams under non-disclosure terms.

**Ad-Hoc Partnerships and Government Role**

The ad-hoc nature of these partnerships, while seemingly informal, aligns with how the Internet operates and how criminals collaborate. Top-down control and government directives are less effective against the rapidly evolving threat landscape. Government agencies, such as the FBI and Homeland Security, can support these efforts by participating in ad-hoc public-private partnerships, as seen in the National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance (NCFTA) and the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT).

**Financial Aspects**

Notably, both takedowns were zero-fee events, ensuring a level playing field. The only financial transaction in Operation Ghost Click was a modest contract for technical services between the DOJ and the court-appointed receiver.

**III. Understanding Botnets: Origin and Proliferation**

Botnets are networks of compromised computers, or "robots," running unauthorized software. With billions of Internet users and millions of unattended servers, including industrial control systems, the potential for exploitation is vast. Every Internet-connected device runs complex software, and the primary requirement is interoperability. This complexity, combined with the lack of robust security measures, makes devices vulnerable to botnet attacks.

Criminals find botnets attractive due to their ability to scale and automate malicious activities. Effective takedown and remediation require a coordinated, flexible, and adaptive response, leveraging the strengths of both public and private sectors.
