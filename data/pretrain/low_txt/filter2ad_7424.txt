## Abstract
The proliferation of sensor-rich mobile devices has propelled the paradigm of mobile crowdsensing, enabling convenient and cost-effective collection of large volumes of sensory data for applications such as traffic monitoring, environmental monitoring, and personalized recommendation services [1, 2]. However, the reliability of this data is often compromised due to factors like heterogeneous sensor quality and noise. This raises a critical challenge: how to extract accurate information from unreliable sensory data, a problem known as truth discovery [3]. Additionally, data privacy is a significant concern in mobile crowdsensing, as the collected data can reveal sensitive information about users' daily routines, locations, health, and social relationships [1].

In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing privacy-preserving truth discovery techniques for mobile crowdsensing [4, 5]. In this keynote, I will present our research on privacy-preserving truth discovery in mobile crowdsensing. Our goal is to ensure privacy preservation, cost efficiency, and practical deployment for truth discovery in mobile crowdsensing. I will first discuss the research challenges, which include the complex functional requirements of truth discovery and practical deployment. I will then introduce our solutions, which leverage advanced cryptographic techniques such as garbled circuits and homomorphic encryption, and are tailored for practical performance [6–8]. Finally, I will explore future directions for researchers and practitioners to further investigate innovative solutions for privacy-preserving truth discovery in mobile crowdsensing.
