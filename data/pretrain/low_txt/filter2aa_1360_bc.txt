### Search Results and Archiving

The results identify over twenty websites that contain the specified terms, with each site hosting multiple archived copies. This data spans decades of content, much of which is no longer available on the current public internet. Many domains have been completely shut down. Notably, even websites I own appear in these results, despite my efforts to block archiving through server configuration files. These sites would not be found by directly searching the domains via the Wayback Machine. This underscores the importance of checking all available resources before concluding an investigation.

### Search Engine Caching

Google and Bing tend to display very recent results, often identical to the live view. However, the Yandex cache from a week prior is more likely to show modified content. Baidu can sometimes provide even older cached versions of pages than Yandex.

### Cross-Country Search

This feature allows you to conduct a single search across two country-specific sites, displaying results in a single column. Foreign results are automatically translated to English. While the first few sponsored results may be similar, the official results should differ.

### Importance of Caches

Caches are particularly useful when a website appears to be present and unaltered. They can reveal changes in content, highlighting information that was meant to be deleted. These minor alterations can be crucial for investigations. Most people are unaware of this technique.

### International Searches

Not all useful information is available on English-language websites. Your target may be from another country or have international connections. While Google and Bing attempt to account for this, their technology is not perfect. For example, google.fr presents a French search page, which may produce different results from google.com.

### Translation Tools

- **Google Translator (translate.google.com)**
- **Bing Translator (bing.com/translator)**
- **DeepL (deepL.com/translator)**
- **PROMT Online Translator (online-translator.com)**
- **Google Input Tools (google.com/inputtools/try)**

Using multiple translation services ensures a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of foreign content. This is especially important for translating Tweets and other short messages that may not be grammatically correct.

### Google Input Tools

Google's Input Tools allow you to type in any language. By selecting the desired language and typing, you can see how the text appears in that language. This technique is particularly effective on Twitter, where searches are filtered by keyword and language.

### Newspaper Archives

- **Google News Archive (news.google.com)**
- **Google Newspaper Archive (news.google.com/newspapers)**
- **Newspaper Archive (newspaperarchive.com)**

These archives provide high-resolution scans of newspapers, ranging from the 1800s to the present. While some require a subscription, many libraries offer free access to their collections. A Google search can help you find these free resources.

### Advanced Search Features

- **Google Advanced Search (google.com/advanced_search)**
- **Bing Advanced Search (search.yahoo.com/web/advanced)**
- **Old Fulton (fultonhistory.com/Fulton.html)**
- **Library of Congress US News Directory (chroniclingamerica.loc.gov)**
- **Small Town Newspapers (stparchive.com)**

### Specialized Search Engines

- **Google Blogs (google.com/search?q=TEST&tbm=nws&tbs=nrt:b)**
- **Google Patents (google.com/?tbm=pts)**
- **Google Scholar (scholar.google.com)**
- **Keyword Tool (keywordtool.io)**

These specialized engines can provide unique and valuable results that are not easily found through standard searches.

### Other Alternatives

- **Searx (searx.be)**
- **Exalead (exalead.com/search)**
- **Start Page (startpage.com)**

These meta-crawlers and alternative search engines offer additional features and privacy benefits, making them useful tools for comprehensive research.

### Real-World Application

I have successfully used these techniques in various investigations, including one where I helped a medium-sized business investigate customer complaints about a faulty product. By using Keyword Tool, I discovered a misspelling of the product name, leading to more relevant data for the client.

### Conclusion

By leveraging a variety of search engines, caches, and translation tools, you can conduct thorough and effective investigations. Always check multiple sources and use advanced search features to ensure a comprehensive and unbiased approach.
