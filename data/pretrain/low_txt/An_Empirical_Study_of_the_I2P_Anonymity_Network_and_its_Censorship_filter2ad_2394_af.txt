### Examination of Censorship Resistance in I2P

Although I2P is not as widely used as Tor, primarily due to its nature as a self-contained anonymity network, our measurements over a three-month period reveal a consistent network size. The network maintained an average of approximately 32,000 daily active peers. Among these, around 14,000 peers were connecting from behind NATs or firewalls. Additionally, we identified a group of about 6,000 peers located in countries with low Press Freedom scores.

Our findings indicate that despite I2P's decentralized architecture, a censor can effectively prevent local users from accessing the network at a relatively low cost. In our censorship resistance evaluation, we assumed the victim to be a long-term, robust peer with uninterrupted network participation. However, we demonstrated that a censor could block more than 95% of the IP addresses found in the victim’s network database (netDb) by operating just 10 routers. By applying different blacklist time windows and increasing the number of routers (e.g., to 20), a censor could achieve a blocking rate of nearly 100%.

### Future Work

In future research, we plan to explore the feasibility of using newly joined peers in combination with firewalled peers as bridges for those who are blocked from accessing the network.

### Acknowledgments

We would like to express our gratitude to our shepherd, Mirja Kühlewind, the anonymous reviewers, and the following members of the I2P team for their valuable feedback: Sadie Doreen, str4d, echelon, meeh, psi, slumlord, and zzz.
