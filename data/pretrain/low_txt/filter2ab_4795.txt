### Title: Black Hat US-20: A Decade of RATs â€“ Custom Chinese Linux Rootkits for Everyone

While 2020 is the Year of the Rat in the Chinese zodiac, it feels more like the Decade of the RATs (Remote Access Trojans) in the cybersecurity world. In this presentation, I will unveil a nearly decade-long, undetected, state-sponsored campaign targeting Linux servers that form the backbone of modern government and industry infrastructure.

Through the discovery of a comprehensive suite of custom-crafted Linux malware, ranging from interactive installation scripts to kernel rootkits and attacker control panels, I have been able to construct a rare and uniquely detailed narrative of a coordinated espionage effort. This talk will reveal how five Chinese Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups, originally stemming from the notorious WINNTI collective, formed a specialized Linux cell.

Set against the backdrop of recent, renewed efforts by the U.S. Department of Justice to expose and prosecute Chinese espionage, this presentation sheds light on a new and troubling chapter in an otherwise familiar story of Chinese intellectual property theft. The scope of this activity extends beyond Linux, crossing into the Android and Windows platforms as well.

The presentation will demonstrate how the attackers successfully exploited common defender assumptions about the security of Linux, the treatment of Windows adware, and the overall deployment of security products and services. Attendees will also be introduced to intriguing questions, such as:

- Is a Chinese APT group behind the development of one of the most widely used, commercially available RATs for mobile devices?
- Is the WINNTI collective responsible for creating the largest known Linux DDoS botnet?

Join us to delve into the details of this sophisticated and long-standing espionage operation.
