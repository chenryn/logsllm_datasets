When I run `flutter doctor`, the only issue it reports is: "Android licenses not accepted. To resolve this, run: `flutter doctor --android-licenses`." 

However, even after running the suggested command and accepting each license by pressing "y", `flutter doctor` still complains about the Android licenses.

Here is the output of `flutter doctor -v`:

I also posted this issue on the Google Groups for Flutter, and it was suggested that this might be a bug. Therefore, I am posting it here for further assistance.
