### 9.1 Best Practices for Password-Reuse Notifications

Our Study 1 results led us to identify five key design goals for password-reuse notifications (Section 5). Some of these goals, such as timeliness, are derived from general guidelines for warning design. However, the importance of providing adequate background information and engendering trust are more specific to the domain of password reuse. Our model notification in Study 2 performed best according to these goals, suggesting the following best practices for designing password-reuse notifications:

- **Explicitly State the Root Causes**: The notification should clearly explain that the situation is due to password reuse and a data breach.
- **Force a Password Reset**: Providers should require users to reset their passwords on their service.
- **Encourage Changing Similar Passwords**: The notification should strongly recommend changing similar passwords on other accounts and thoroughly explain why this is necessary to prevent future attacks.
- **Promote 2FA and Password Managers**: The notification should explicitly encourage users to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) and use password managers.
- **Use Multiple Communication Channels**: Notifications should be sent via both email and more immediate channels, such as a blocking notification upon login.

### 9.2 Addressing Persistent Misunderstandings

While the real-world notifications tested in Study 1 were successful in raising concern, many respondents were unclear about the correct actions to take. The model notification synthesized for Study 2, along with its variants, was effective in prompting the majority of respondents to report that they would change their password on the site that sent the notification. However, this success was tempered by the fact that many respondents reported that their new password would often be a minor variation of their previous one or a password reused from another account. Additionally, many respondents indicated that they would not change their passwords on other providers. Collectively, these decisions leave users vulnerable to future attacks leveraging password reuse.

The model notification had mixed success in encouraging respondents to take two other actions that could mitigate password reuse:
- **Adoption of 2FA**: Nearly two-thirds of respondents reported being likely to adopt 2FA after receiving the notifications.
- **Use of Password Managers**: Only about 40% of respondents reported being likely to use a password manager, regardless of whether the notification explicitly encouraged it. Future work could explore whether more explicit explanations of the specific situation and the importance of these actions might be more effective.

### 9.3 Discussion

We conducted the first systematic study on how users understand and intend to respond to security notifications related to password reuse. Through two complementary user studies, we identified best practices for the design of password-reuse notifications and pinpointed areas where notifications fall short in helping users fully remediate password reuse issues. Our formative study lays the groundwork for future field studies. We recommend future work that does not rely solely on self-reporting but instead tests the best practices we developed for password-reuse notifications in more ecologically valid situations.
