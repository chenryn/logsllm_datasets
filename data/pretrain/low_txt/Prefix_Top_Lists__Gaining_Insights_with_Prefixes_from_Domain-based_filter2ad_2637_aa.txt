## Abstract
Domain-based top lists, such as the Alexa Top 1M, aim to reflect the popularity of web domains. Despite their known limitations (e.g., instability, lack of aggregation, and absence of weights), these lists remain a crucial tool in Internet measurement studies. In this paper, we introduce the concept of prefix top lists, which address some of these shortcomings while providing insights into the importance of addresses in domain-based top lists. By aggregating domain-based top lists into network prefixes and applying a Zipf distribution to assign weights, we find that different domain-based top lists offer varied perspectives on Internet prefixes. Our analysis reveals minimal weight changes over time. We utilize prefix top lists to evaluate DNS deployment quality, demonstrating that popular domains generally adhere to name server recommendations for IPv4, but compliance is lacking for IPv6. Finally, we provide these enhanced and more stable prefix top lists to the research community to facilitate more representative measurement results.

## 1 Introduction
An essential step in conducting Internet measurements is the selection of targets. These can range from the entire Internet (which is impractical in IPv6 [11, 12]), to subsets based on random sampling, or using domain-based top lists to gather suitable targets. Many Internet measurement studies use domain-based top lists like the Alexa Top 1M [2], Majestic [17], and Umbrella [8] to obtain a representative sample of hosts. However, these lists are known to be unstable [21] and lack aggregation and weighting, making it difficult to compare the relative popularity of entries.

In this paper, we propose a new technique to associate IP prefixes with weights that represent their importance. Prefix top lists, consisting of network prefixes rather than domains, can be used in measurement studies beyond the scope of domain-based top lists. We create prefix top lists by mapping domains to IP addresses, aggregating these addresses into prefixes, and applying a Zipf distribution to assign weights. This approach allows us to rank prefixes and provide a more stable and representative view of the Internet's infrastructure.

Prefix top lists can be applied in various Internet measurement studies, such as identifying top CDN networks, evaluating the Internet's infrastructure, or analyzing dependencies of core routers. In this paper, we present an analysis of DNS name server deployment using prefix top lists. To support further research, we make our prefix top lists available at https://prefixtoplists.net.in.tum.de/.

## 2 Prefix Top List

### 2.1 Domain Top List
Existing top lists rank their entries based on proprietary metrics, with processes and raw data sources not publicly available. They often exhibit weekly fluctuations [21]. Previous work [15] suggests merging multiple top lists to create more stable versions. This can be done by averaging each top list over multiple days. The popularity in the Internet follows a Zipf distribution [1, 6, 13, 14], allowing differently ranked input lists to be combined by aggregating their Zipf weights. The Zipf weight \( w \) for rank \( k \) in a total of \( N \) elements is calculated as:

\[ w = \frac{1/k^s}{\sum_{n=1}^{N} 1/n^s} \]

The parameter \( s \) determines the slope of the distribution; larger values of \( s \) increase the weight for top-ranking elements and reduce the weight for low-ranking elements. Based on previous work [15], we use \( s = 1 \).

We extend this approach by using the Zipf distribution to assign ranks and transfer weights to the resulting top list for further analysis. The different input top lists are joined based on domain names, and the average weight is calculated. If a domain name does not appear in an input list, it is assigned a weight of 0. Our weighted list, called a domain top list, is created by averaging the input top lists' Zipf weights over the previous week to mitigate weekly fluctuations. Table 1 shows the domain top list for August 1, 2019, based on the Alexa list.

### 2.2 Address Resolution
To create prefix and AS-based top lists, domain names need to be resolved. We deploy a custom DNS resolver to collect a rich DNS data set. This full resolver discovers the zone setup using QNAME minimization (cf. RFC 7816 [7]) and queries all available authoritative name servers for each query. The name servers for each zone are discovered through delegation from the parent zone, trustworthy glue records, and additional NS records in the zone apex. The individual name server names are resolved by the same process, and the executed queries and zone setups are saved with metadata.

Compared to traditional resolvers, this allows for in-depth investigation of the zone setup and name servers. All domains in the daily domain top list are resolved every day in a randomized order, split into multiple shards to avoid high load spikes on shared authoritative name servers. The following shards are scanned and later merged into a single dataset:
- **Backfill:** Domains contained within the top lists over the last week but no longer included.
- **Umbrella t0:** The Umbrella top list for today.
- **Alexa t0 ∪ Majestic t0:** The deduplicated union of the Alexa and Majestic top lists for today.
- **n=−1 Alexa tn, Majestic tn, Umbrella tn \ (Alexa t0 ∪ Majestic t0 ∪ Umbrella t0):** Domains from the past week not currently in the top lists.

After resolving the zones and domain names, IP addresses are extracted. If a domain points to multiple IP addresses, all are extracted. This resolution process represents a local view and is susceptible to DNS-based load balancing, which we discuss in Section 5.

### 2.3 Prefix-based Top Lists
For generating prefix-based top lists, we choose different aggregation levels: ASes, BGP announced prefixes, and normalized prefixes. Normalized prefixes are /24 prefixes (/48 for IPv6), representing the smallest generally propagated BGP announcements. The aggregation levels are hierarchical, with each normalized prefix belonging to one BGP announced prefix, and each BGP announced prefix belonging to one AS. For assignment, a localized BGP dump is used, and in case of multiple origin ASes, the lower AS number is taken.

For aggregation and ranking, the weight of an input domain is transferred based on the resolved mappings. If a domain resolves to multiple objects, the weight is distributed accordingly. The generated prefix top lists provide a more stable and representative view of the Internet's infrastructure.
