**Why This Talk?**
- My fascination with phone phreaking began after DEF CON 15, but I felt I had missed the opportunity.
- However, phone phreaking is not dead; we now have VoIP!
- Today, we will focus on:
  - Call flooding using feature codes
  - SMS flooding using feature codes
  - Caller ID spoofing using feature codes
  - Potential for additional "features"

**Basic Terminology:**
- **Vertical Service Code (VSC) or Feature Code:** A special code dialed to activate a specific telephone service.
- **Private Branch eXchange (PBX):** A telephone exchange system that serves a private organization, managing internal communication and external lines.

**The History of Feature Codes:**
- Developed by AT&T in the 1960s and 1970s as part of the Custom Local Area Signaling Service (CLASS).
- The term "vertical service code" was adopted by the North American Numbering Plan Administration (NANPA) because "CLASS" was an AT&T trademark.
- These codes were used locally within the Central Office (CO) and not for inter-company communication.

**Our Feature Codes:**
- Managed by the North American Numbering Plan Administration (NANPA).

**What Do We Mean By “Weaponize”?**
- **Weaponize (v.):** To convert something for use as a weapon.
- Feature codes are not inherently malicious, but they can be misused.
- The potential damage ranges from simple annoyance to significant disruption of business and personal relationships.

**Materials You Will Need:**
- A Linux machine
- Asterisk Software PBX by Digium installed on the Linux machine
- VoIP service provider (e.g., Vitelity, Bandwidth, RingCentral)
- A hard or soft phone registered with your PBX
- Imagination

**The Structure of Our Feature Codes:**
- **[context-label]:** Denotes the start of a context in Asterisk, essentially a part of your dial plan.
- **\*4X.:**
  - \* indicates the beginning of the feature code.
  - 4 is chosen to preserve standard vertical service codes.
  - X is a placeholder for any number between 0-9.
  - . tells Asterisk to accept any numbers following the feature code as user input.
- **Example:** *427028675309

**Feature Code: *40 - The Call Flood**
- **Demo Time!**
- **Mitigation Techniques:**
  - Pattern matching call drop in Asterisk.
  - Can be bypassed by changing the Caller ID on a per-call basis.
  - For phones not behind a PBX, carrier-level mitigation is necessary.

**Feature Code: *41 - The SMS Flood**
- **Demo Time…. Again!**
- **Practical Use:**
  - Clicking a malicious link to stop the flood.
  - Sending "3 AM" texts from a supposed mistress.
- **SMS Flood Mitigation:**
  - Carriers can limit SMS delivery.
  - Using Google Voice (flood works against Project Fi).
  - Turning off your cell phone (the flood will resume when the phone is turned back on).

**Feature Code: *42 - A Spoofy Ghost**
- **Stop!**
- **Spoofing is NOT new, but still practical:**
  - Used in social engineering attacks to gain trust.
  - Useful for voicemail hacking, though this is becoming less viable.

**Imagination and Future Possibilities:**
- We still have *43 - *49 available for experimentation.
- Ideas for preset attack structures.
- Nmap scan with IP address as dialed input?
- Audience ideas and feedback.
- Launching automated campaigns without being at a computer.

**Conclusion:**
- Feature codes offer a powerful toolset for both legitimate and malicious purposes.
- Understanding and mitigating their misuse is crucial for maintaining security and privacy.
