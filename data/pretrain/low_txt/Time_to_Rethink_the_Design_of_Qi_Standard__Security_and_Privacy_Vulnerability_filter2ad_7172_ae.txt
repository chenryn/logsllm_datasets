**Security and Privacy Vulnerability Analysis of Qi Wireless Charging**

**Yi Wu, Zhuohang Li, Nicholas Van Nostrand, and Jian Liu**

**Introduction to Security Challenges in Qi Standard**

The self-calibration characteristic of the Qi standard necessitates that an adversary continuously injects malicious messages at a high frequency to maintain an effective attack. The transmitter can monitor the message reception rate and terminate the charging process upon detecting a sudden increase. Additionally, wireless charger identification or authentication could be implemented to defend against hijacking attacks. However, this would require additional efforts to detect successfully injected Qi messages on the charger's primary coil. A recent study [53] demonstrated the potential to identify wireless chargers by fingerprinting based on the intrinsic nonlinear distortion effects of the underlying charging circuit. We will explore whether these fingerprints can be used at the circuit level to design a more resilient charging system.

**Defending Against Eavesdropping Attacks**

For eavesdropping attacks, besides adding irregular noise to the primary coil voltage, another possible defense is to implement lightweight encryption mechanisms (e.g., lightweight block ciphers, hash functions [41], and AES [16]) on the Qi communication channel. This helps prevent Qi messages from being intercepted. Some studies [1, 18, 19, 54, 55] have proposed chaotically regulating the frequency of the power source to encrypt the energy, ensuring that only legitimate power receivers can acquire it. Since Qi uses AM modulation to modulate data bits on its carrier signal, we can potentially leverage this chaotic frequency regulation technique in reverse to protect the Qi messages sent from the charging device to the charger. These potential approaches are part of our future work.

**Disclosure and Industry Collaboration**

We are collaborating with industry partners to address the identified threats. We have informed the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) [47] about the potential security and privacy risks associated with Qi wireless charging, and the resolution of these threats is ongoing.

**Related Work: Security and Privacy Threats in Wired and Wireless Charging**

**Wired Charging Threats**

Due to the limited lifespan of smartphone batteries, numerous USB charging stations have been installed in public areas such as airports, hotels, and hospitals. While these stations provide convenience, they also expose users to significant privacy threats. For example, Mactans [24] demonstrated the deployment of malware on iOS devices within one minute of being plugged into a malicious USB wall charger. Tian et al. [43] showed that AT commands issued through USB charging interfaces can launch various types of attacks on Android devices, such as unlocking screens and injecting touch events. KeySweeper [23] uses a malicious USB wall charger to passively sniff, decrypt, and log keystrokes from wireless keyboards. Yang et al. [51] revealed that webpage browsing activity on smartphones while charging can be collected via power trace analysis. They also proposed a new attack on Tor to identify visited websites using power consumption information [50]. Spolaor et al. [42] demonstrated the potential for data exfiltration (e.g., IMEI, contacts' phone numbers) through a power-only USB charging cable. Meng et al. [28-30] proposed juice filming attacks that automatically monitor and record the phone screen during the charging process.

**Wireless Charging Threats**

Compared to wired charging, research on the security and privacy of wireless charging is still in its early stages. Several studies have explored the security and safety issues of wireless powered communication networks. For instance, Dai et al. [9] proposed an algorithm to maximize the charging utility of far-field, radio frequency-based wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs) while ensuring human safety under electromagnetic radiation (EMR) exposure. Lin et al. [25] introduced a denial-of-charging attack on WRSNs, which exhausts rechargeable sensor nodes faster than usual by generating fake charging requests. Niyato et al. [32, 33] formulated theoretical models (e.g., game-theoretic models) to analyze energy request and data transmission policies under jamming attacks. To prevent unauthorized electric vehicles (EVs) from obtaining energy, several studies [18, 19, 54, 55] proposed energy encryption mechanisms. There has been limited discussion on the security and privacy threats of these wireless charging systems, particularly for mobile devices. A survey paper [27] briefly mentioned the possibility of eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks against Qi but did not provide technical details or proof-of-concept experiments. The discussion was limited to identity leakage, without considering the potential for hijacking attacks or revealing sensitive private information. Roychowdhury [37] proposed an encryption method to protect transmitted communication packets via simulation, and Yang et al. [49] proposed QID, a system that identifies different charging devices using unique features extracted from coil activities. These papers also focused primarily on identity leakage. In general, the underlying threats of Qi wireless charging warrant greater attention.

**Our Contribution**

Unlike existing studies, we aim to highlight the potential vulnerabilities of wireless charging, particularly Qi wireless charging for mobile devices, to prioritize their mitigation. We analyze the Qi standard from both security and privacy perspectives and demonstrate the capability of an adversary to take over the entire charging process and infer various phone activities while it is being charged.

**Conclusion**

In this paper, we conducted the first comprehensive study to explore the potential security and privacy vulnerabilities of Qi wireless charging. We demonstrated that due to the open propagation characteristic of electromagnetic signals, the Qi communication channel can be easily hijacked by injecting malicious Qi messages through the stealthy placement of an adversarial coil on the charger. Additionally, an adversary can snoop on Qi messages transmitted between the wireless charger and the charging device to detect and identify the device's activities (e.g., incoming phone calls and messages from different apps) while being charged. We validated that an adversary can reduce charging efficiency, stop power transfer, cause overcharging, and potentially damage the battery by injecting malicious Qi messages. Extensive experiments using multiple commodity smartphones and 14 commonly used social apps demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed eavesdropping attack.
