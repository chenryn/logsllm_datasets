# Resistance is Futile

## Limited Maneuverability
- **Online Activism (Abroad) Since 1996**: International pressure, shareholder threats, business boycotts, and nation-state sanctions have all played a role.
- **Data Filtering Provider**: Denied knowledge of software sales. The website shows the Prime Minister and Sales Director closing the deal.
- **Website Defacement**: Noted in four instances, particularly in Cuba.

## No Private Connections
- **Cuba**: Highly educated but with no private internet connections.
- **Government Objectives**:
  - **Realistic Goal**: Prevent ordinary users from engaging in blatant attacks.
  - **Unrealistic Goal**: Stop sophisticated users from conducting advanced attacks.

## Analysts Overwhelmed
- **Technology Outpacing Bureaucracy**: Software and hardware are constantly evolving, and website content is highly dynamic.
- **Challenges in Computer Network Defense**: The difficulties in defending against cyber threats cannot be overstated.

## E-conomics
- **Politics vs. Progress**: Monopolies harm efficiency and vitality.
- **Internet Thrives on Information Exchange**: Censorship slows down both cyberspace and the economy.
- **Future Trends**: The world will become increasingly connected.
- **Fukuyama's "The End of History"**: A philosophical perspective on the future.

## The Future of Cyber Resistance
- **Internet as a Champion of Freedom**: Traditional media is more susceptible to control.
- **Ordinary Citizens and Activists**: Privacy advocates should be cautiously optimistic.

## Common Tools
- **Telecommunications and Satellite Access**: Foreign ISPs, pseudonymous email, peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, anonymous proxies, and encryption.
- **Covert Communication**: Dead drops, steganography, covert channels, and creative use of applications, protocols, and ports.
- **Innovative Techniques**: Using text as pictures, hiding information in whitespace, and other creative methods.

## In the News
- **Psiphon**: A Citizen Lab project at the University of Toronto.
- **Designed for Restricted Regimes**: Free user #1 installs the software, connection information is sent to user #2, who then communicates cryptographically via user #1.
- **Personal Trust in Security**: No single solution can guarantee complete security.

## No Magic Bullet
- **Anarchic Cyberspace**: There is no perfect attack or defense.
- **Advice**: Increase vigilance during key times like elections.
- **Personal Targeting**: Little may help if you are personally targeted.

## Truth in Cyberspace
- **Evidence Requires**:
  - Uncommon expertise.
  - Infrastructure map.
  - Traffic baseline.
  - Multiple access points and data paths.
  - Knowledge of adversary tactics.
- **Availability**: Normally only accessible to big brother (BB).

## The Human Factor
- **Rising User Sophistication**: Laypersons can now perform basic technical analysis.
- **Symptoms of Censorship**: Latency, banners, errors, and crashes.
- **Quick Investigation**: Determine if outages are due to general censorship or targeted attacks.
- **Content Filtering**: Assess whether content is amenable to filtering.
- **Legitimate or Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)**: What do you think?
