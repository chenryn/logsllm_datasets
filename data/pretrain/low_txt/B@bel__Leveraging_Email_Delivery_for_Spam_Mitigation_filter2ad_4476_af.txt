### Coverage Issues with Sender-Based Techniques

Previous research has demonstrated that IP blacklists often fail to detect a significant portion of IP addresses involved in spamming activities, particularly due to the highly dynamic nature of the machines (typically botnets) used for sending spam [32, 37, 38]. Our method introduces a novel, third approach that focuses on the manner in which messages are sent. This approach avoids the need for costly content analysis and does not require the design or implementation of a reputation metric or blacklist. Instead, we aim to recognize the SMTP dialect during the actual SMTP transaction. Our empirical results show that this method can effectively distinguish between spam and legitimate emails, complementing both pre-acceptance and post-acceptance approaches.

### Related Work

Beverly et al. [5] and Kakavelakis et al. [19] also explored this direction by leveraging the fact that spambots often have poor network connections, and they performed spam detection by analyzing TCP-level features such as retransmissions and connection resets. However, our system is more robust because it does not rely on assumptions about the network connectivity of the mail client.

### Protocol Analysis: Core Idea

The core idea behind our approach is to learn the SMTP dialect used by a particular client. This problem is closely related to automated protocol reverse-engineering, where an unknown protocol is analyzed to determine its structure and individual elements [6, 13]. Early work in this area focused on clustering network traces to group similar messages [14], while later methods extracted protocol information by analyzing program execution during network communication [10, 15, 24, 45, 47]. More sophisticated methods can handle multiple messages and recover the protocol's state machine. For example, Dispatcher is a tool capable of extracting the format of protocol messages when only one endpoint (the bot binary) is accessible [9]. Cho et al. leveraged the information extracted by Dispatcher to learn C&C protocols [11]. Brumley et al. studied how deviations in protocol implementations can be used to detect errors or generate fingerprints [7].

Our problem is related to previous work on protocol analysis, as we extract different SMTP protocol variations and use these variations to build fingerprints. However, we treat the protocol speaker (the bot) as a black box and do not perform code analysis or instrumentation to find protocol formats or deviations. This is important because malware is notoriously difficult to analyze, and we might not always have a malware sample available. Our technique allows us to build SMTP dialect state machines even when interacting with previously unknown spambots.

### Fingerprinting Protocols

There is also a line of research on fingerprinting protocols [12, 30, 49]. Initial work in this area relied on manual analysis, but there are now methods like FiG that automatically generate fingerprints for DNS servers [42]. The main difference between our work and FiG is that our dialects are stateful, while FiG operates on individual messages. This entirely avoids the need to merge and explore protocol state machines. However, as discussed previously, individual messages are typically insufficient to distinguish between SMTP engines.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we introduced a novel method to detect and mitigate spam emails that complements content- and sender-based analysis methods. We focus on how email messages are sent and derive methods to influence the spam delivery mechanism during SMTP transactions. On one hand, we show how small deviations in the SMTP implementation of different email agents (so-called SMTP dialects) allow us to detect spambots during the actual SMTP communication. On the other hand, we study how the feedback mechanism used by botnets can be poisoned, which can negatively impact the effectiveness of botnets.

Empirical results confirm that both aspects of our approach can be used to detect and mitigate spam emails. While spammers might adapt their practices in response to our findings, we argue that this reduces their performance and flexibility.
