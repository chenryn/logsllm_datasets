## Abstract
On May 15, 2001, ICANN announced the introduction of the .biz and .info generic top-level domains (gTLDs)—the first new gTLDs since the inception of the Domain Name System—aiming to "increase consumer choice and create opportunities for entities that have been shut out under the current name structure." The .biz gTLD, in particular, was intended as an alternative to the popular .com top-level domain.

In this paper, we examine the current usage of the .biz gTLD to determine whether it has evolved into the role intended by ICANN and whether concerns expressed in early discussions of this expansion have been justified. Using DNS zone files, DNS probing, and web crawler data, we investigate whether .biz has become a viable alternative to .com, providing trademark holders with an attractive alternative, or if it has merely induced defensive registrations by existing trademark holders who already had equivalent .com domains.

## 1. Introduction
The Domain Name System (DNS) serves as the primary means of assigning names to entities on the Internet. Over 25 years old, its original goal was to provide a consistent way to map host names to IP addresses. Since then, DNS has grown to identify the internet presence of brands, companies, products, political campaigns, and individuals.

Compared to other navigation methods, DNS has a rigid lookup structure: users must know the name precisely and completely to perform a lookup. While search engines offer more flexible navigation, there is still a need for a direct mechanism like the domain system, which remains free of third-party mediation, is succinct enough for print, and is easy for users to act on.

Historically, DNS is arranged hierarchically, with names associated with a suffix, typically a top-level domain (TLD). The original DNS design included generic TLDs (gTLDs) such as .com, .edu, etc., following administrative considerations. The growth of the Web created the need to name broader entities, and .com proved the most open and suitable, becoming the de facto TLD for web addresses.

To the average user, .com became synonymous with the Web, earning a place in the Oxford English Dictionary in 1994. As a result of its popularity, the .com landscape quickly became crowded. To ease the pressure on .com, ICANN introduced .biz and .info in 2001. The success of this endeavor hinged on how users would perceive TLDs: whether they accepted the notion of TLDs as different potential homes for various internet entities or viewed "dot com" as the sole TLD for prominent web enterprises. Would users find it confusing to encounter the same subdomain in different TLDs?

A decade later, ICANN now promotes a new, more open system for introducing new TLDs, which could dramatically change the Domain Name System. This paper evaluates the .biz gTLD, promoted as an alternative to .com. We find that approximately 20% of domains in both .biz and .com are parked, contrary to the original intention to avoid domain speculation in .biz. Furthermore, between 10% and 25% of .biz registrations appear to exist only to defend against name infringement.

The rest of this paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 provides background on the .biz TLD and a survey of related work. Section 3 describes our data collection methodology, followed by our analysis in Section 4, and a brief discussion of our findings in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper.

## 2. Background
In June 1998, the US Department of Commerce called for the creation of a new not-for-profit organization to assume responsibility for the technical coordination functions performed by the IANA. Later that year, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) was formed to fulfill that role. ICANN obtained the authority to manage and perform specific functions related to the coordination of the domain name system, including overseeing policy for adding new TLDs to the root system [8]. In 1999, ICANN formed the Domain Name Supporting Organization (DNSO), an advisory body within ICANN, to handle matters concerning the Domain Name System [6], chartering Working Group C to study the issues surrounding the formation of new generic top-level domains (gTLDs). The Working Group's task was to gauge the need for new gTLDs and, if required, determine their nature and deployment policy [3]. In March 2000, Working Group C released its final report, addressing these questions [10]. The ICANN board adopted its recommendations in July 2000 [5].

### 2.1 The Working Group C Report
The Working Group C report [10] addressed two important questions: whether to create new gTLDs and, if so, how to introduce them. On the need for new gTLDs, the report argued: "Expanding the number of TLDs will increase consumer choice and create opportunities for entities that have been shut out under the current name structure." Moreover, the report observed:

- Existing second-level domain names under the .com TLD routinely change hands for inflated prices.
- These high prices reflect the artificial scarcity of common names in existing gTLDs, especially .com.
- If the name space is expanded, companies will be able to get easy-to-remember domain names more easily, and the entry barriers to successful participation in electronic commerce will be lowered.
- Addition of new TLDs will allow different companies to have the same second-level domain name in different TLDs (emphasis added).

Some members of the Working Group suggested that increasing the number of top-level domains could confuse consumers and increase trademark owners' policing costs and the costs of defensive registrations. They expressed concerns about "trademark holders simply duplicating their existing domains" (emphasis added).

On the nature of the initial rollout, the report weighed two opposing approaches: authorizing "hundreds of new TLDs over the course of the next few years" and introducing new TLDs "slowly and in a controlled manner, and only after effective trademark protection mechanisms had been implemented and shown to be effective." Some members argued that a small number of new gTLDs without a commitment to add more would encourage preemptive and speculative registrations based on the possibility of continued artificial scarcity (emphasis added). The report ultimately proposed "deploying six to ten new TLDs."

### 2.2 Recent Studies
In its recent move to open TLD registration to the general public, ICANN commissioned several reports analyzing the economic consequences of their new initiative. Among other concerns, the reports address the danger that new gTLDs will compel trademark holders to defensively register their marks in each new TLD. The 2009 Carlton report [2] dismisses this as a problem, arguing that "many registrations that 'redirect traffic' to other sites serve productive purposes of attracting and retaining internet traffic, not merely to prevent cybersquatting." Furthermore, the report argues that while some registrations for domain names under the new gTLDs may have been made for defensive purposes, the limited number of registrations for new gTLDs indicates that the vast majority of .com registrants did not find a compelling reason to undertake defensive registrations in the new gTLDs. The 2010 Katz, Rosston, Sullivan report [7] looked back at past TLD introductions: "A broad look at the evidence to date suggests that other gTLDs provide little competition for .com as those gTLDs have neither attracted a large number of domains nor shown any signs of catching up with .com." The report also notes that the prospects of cyber-squatting within new gTLDs could force parties to undertake defensive registrations.

Most closely related to our work is the 2002 survey of .biz registrations by Zittrain and Edelman [11]. They found that 90.5% of names registered in .biz also occur in .com (consistent with our finding). To assess whether .biz and .com registrants overlapped, the survey authors examined Whois records, comparing records based on registrant postal code, email address, and name server second-level domains. They found that 35.4% of .biz-.com pairs matched in at least one attribute, 25.8% in two, and 12.9% in all three.

## 3. Data and Methodology
This paper aims to answer two basic questions: how do owners of .biz domains use their domains, and, if in active use, whether the .biz domain forms the primary domain of the registrant or whether it merely defends one registered under another gTLD. To start, we obtained the .biz and .com zone files, dated June 27, 2011, to coincide with the 10-year anniversary of the .biz TLD's addition to the authoritative root server. We use three sets of domain names: all 2.1 million .biz domains, their 2 million (94%) .com namesakes, and a random sample of 2 million .com domains. We rely on four sources of data to classify domains: zone files, active DNS queries, Whois registration records, and web content.

### 3.1 Zone Files
A zone file contains the DNS records used by a name server, typically in BIND format. We obtained the zone files for the .biz and .com gTLDs from their respective registries. We used the zone files to get the list of .biz and .com domains and determine which domains were registered in both gTLDs. We also gathered their name server information for the DNS crawler.

### 3.2 Whois
We retrieved the Whois registration information for each .biz–.com pair in our dataset. Since Whois records consist of free-form text, we used a customized version of phpWhois [2] to parse the Whois records and extract the domain registrant (owner) information. Many registrars have limits on the number of Whois queries they will answer. Additionally, phpWhois could not parse all Whois entries. Due to these limitations, we could only extract registrant information from 65% of our .biz–.com pairs.

To assess whether the .biz domain and its .com namesake share the same owner, we compare the registrant information returned by phpWhois. We first exclude domains that use Whois privacy mechanisms (e.g., the Domains by Proxy service). We compute the Levenshtein distance between both domains for each of: the registrant's name, e-mail address, phone, and fax number. We mark each of these fields as missing if they are absent or less than 5 characters long in either domain. We mark a field as a match if present and the Levenshtein distance between .biz and .com does not exceed 2 (requiring an exact match does not significantly alter our results). We also mark registrant names as a match if the name from one domain forms a substring of the other domain.

We consider two Whois records a strong match if at least two of the four categories match and at most one category is missing. We consider them a weak match if any of the four categories match. We use both types of matches but differentiate between them in our analysis.

We note that for a significant number of .com domains, the Whois record we retrieved only contained the registrant name but no further fields. Therefore, we cannot have a strong match for any of these domains.

### 3.3 DNS Probing
We queried the DNS records for a list of all .biz domains and their .com counterparts, as well as the randomly selected set of .com domains. For each name, we queried (starting at the root) to find the authoritative name servers for the .biz and .com versions of the domain. We performed the crawling with a custom Python library on September 12th and 13th, 2011.

### 3.4 Web Crawl
We collected the content of the web pages belonging to the registered domains in our datasets. First, we downloaded the pages for the domains in the .biz zone file, e.g., foo.biz. Then, we crawled the corresponding .com domain foo.com to check the registration purpose for the .biz domain. When downloading the web pages, we recorded the HTTP status codes for success, redirection, errors, and other standardized events. We also recorded unknown errors. Note that at times we could not retrieve the web pages, either because the domain owners wanted to serve no web content or due to the time interval (several months) between the zone file creation and our active web crawling.

### 3.5 Content Classification
To identify parked domains, we built a simple classifier that searches for a set of regular expressions in the downloaded content. We created highly specific patterns to match templates for the largest known parking sites. We relied on unique features of the page, such as JavaScript libraries or image servers used by the parked pages.

## 4. Analysis
Recall that we set out to evaluate a number of predictions made about the effects of introducing a new gTLD: whether it would lead to "trademark holders simply duplicating their existing domains" or "will allow different companies to have the same second-level domain name in different TLDs"; whether it "would encourage pre-emptive and speculative registrations based on the possibility of continued artificial scarcity" [10].

To answer these questions, we first group .biz domains into three functional categories:

- **Primary**: Primary domains identify a company, product, service, or organization, either publicly or internally. In other words, the registrant actually uses primary domains. For example, NeuStar, Inc. and UC San Diego use neustar.biz and ucsd.edu, respectively, as the primary domain names by which they identify themselves on the Internet.
- **Defensive**: A registrant uses a domain registration only to defend a name while not actively employing the domain to identify itself, its service, or network resources. Examples of defensive registrations are google.biz and gooogle.com, both of which redirect to google.com.
- **Parked**: Registrants park domains with the purpose of reselling them or generating advertising revenue from accidental user visits to the site.

## 5. Discussion
Our findings indicate that approximately 20% of domains in both .biz and .com are parked, contrary to the original intention to avoid domain speculation in .biz. Furthermore, between 10% and 25% of .biz registrations appear to exist only to defend against name infringement. This suggests that the .biz gTLD has not fully evolved into the role intended by ICANN. Instead, it has primarily served as a defensive registration tool for existing trademark holders rather than a viable alternative for new entrants.

## 6. Conclusion
In conclusion, the .biz gTLD, introduced as an alternative to the crowded .com TLD, has not achieved its intended purpose. The high percentage of parked and defensive registrations indicates that the .biz TLD has not provided the desired opportunities for new entities. Future introductions of new TLDs should carefully consider the lessons learned from the .biz experience to ensure they meet the needs of a diverse range of internet users and stakeholders.
