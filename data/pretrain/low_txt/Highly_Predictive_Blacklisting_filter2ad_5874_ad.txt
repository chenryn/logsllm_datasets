**Comparison of HPB and LWOL:**
- Overall, HPBs demonstrate a performance advantage over LWOL.
- The IV and RI values also exhibit similar distributions.
- Comparing Figures 8 and 7, we see that HPB has more hit improvement compared to LWOL than to GWOL in this time window.

### 4.2 Prediction of New Attacks

A key assumption in secure collaborative defense strategies is that participants can prepare for attacks they have not yet encountered. A new attack is defined as a DShield log entry from a source that the contributor has never reported before. This experiment shows that HPB analysis provides contributors with a potential to predict more new attacks than GWOL.

- **Methodology:**
  - For each contributor, we construct two new lists, HPB-local and GWOL-local, each containing 1000 entries, excluding any entries reported by the contributor during the training window.
  - **HPB-local:** HPB minus local
  - **GWOL-local:** GWOL minus local

- **Results:**
  - Figure 9 compares HPB-local and GWOL-local on their ability to predict new attack sources for the local contributor.
  - The hit number plots demonstrate that HPB-local provides substantial improvement over the predictive value of GWOL.

### 4.3 Timely Inclusion of Sources

Timely inclusion refers to the ability of a blacklist to incorporate addresses relevant to the blacklist owner before those addresses have saturated the Internet. We examine how many contributors need to report a particular attacker before it can be included in the respective blacklists.

- **Methodology:**
  - Focus on attackers within these blacklists that carried out attacks during the prediction window.
  - Use the number of distinct victims (contributors) attacked in the training window to measure the extent to which the source has saturated the Internet.

- **Results:**
  - Figure 10 plots the distribution of the number of distinct victims across different attackers on the three blacklists.
  - Attackers selected on the GWOL were the most prolific in the training period, with all sources attacking more than 20 contributors and almost 1/3 attacking more than 200 contributors.
  - LWOLs select attacker addresses focused on local networks, with most addresses attacking fewer contributors.
  - HPBs’ distribution is close to that of the LWOL, allowing the incorporation of attackers that have not saturated the Internet.

### 4.4 Performance Consistency

The results show that the HPB provides an increase in hit count performance across the majority of all contributors. We investigate the consistency of HPB’s performance over time.

- **Methodology:**
  - Use a 60-day DShield dataset divided into 12 time windows (T0, T1, ..., T11).
  - Generate blacklists from data in time window Ti−1 and test the lists on data in Ti.
  - For each contributor v, compare HPB with GWOL and obtain eleven improvement values (IVs).

- **Consistency Index (CI):**
  - If IVi(v) ≥ 0, HPB performs well for v in window i.
  - CI(v) = |{p ∈ IVs(v) : p ≥ 0}| − |{p ∈ IVs(v) : p < 0}|

- **Results:**
  - Figure 11 plots the sorted CI values against the contributors.
  - For almost 70% of the contributors, HPB’s performance is extremely consistent, with a CI value of 11.
  - For more than 90% of the contributors, HPBs demonstrate fairly good consistency.
  - Only 5 contributors show a performance index below -3.

### 4.5 Blacklist Length

We vary the length of the blacklists to 500, 1000, 5000, and 10000 and compare the hit counts of HPBs, GWOLs, and LWOLs.

- **Methodology:**
  - Plot the medians of the hit rates (hit count divided by blacklist length).

- **Results:**
  - Figure 12 shows that HPBs have the hit rate advantage for all choices in blacklist length.
  - The relative amount of advantage is maintained across different lengths.

### 4.6 Training and Prediction Window Sizes

We investigate how far into the future the HPB can maintain its advantage over GWOL and LWOL and how different training window sizes affect an HPB’s hit count.

- **Methodology:**
  - Left panel of Figure 13 shows the median of the hit count of HPB, GWOL, and LWOL on day 1, 2, 3, ..., 20 for each individual day in the prediction window.

- **Results:**
  - Helps determine how often we need to recompute the blacklist and select the right amount of history data as input to our system.
