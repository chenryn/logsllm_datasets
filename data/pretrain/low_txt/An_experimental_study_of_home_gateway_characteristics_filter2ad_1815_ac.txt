### Summary of the Results of Other Tests

#### Table 2: Summary of the Results of Other Tests

- **SCTP Support**: The SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) works because only IP headers are translated, and the SCTP checksum does not cover the network-layer pseudo-header. Further experiments are needed to better characterize the nature of SCTP support in these devices, including whether SCTP multihoming works over those devices that support a single-homed connection.
- **DNS Support**: Out of the tested devices, 14 accept connections on TCP port 53 (DNS), and 10 of them accept and respond to DNS queries on that TCP port. This is roughly in agreement with [9]. The device "ap" forwards DNS queries arriving via TCP over UDP, while the others forward over TCP.

### Observations and Discussion

#### UDP Binding Timeouts
The results in Section 4.1 indicate that although UDP binding timeouts are relatively low for bindings that see little use (UDP-1), bindings that see some bidirectional traffic (UDP-2) and especially bindings that see repeated bidirectional traffic (UDP-3) are granted longer timeouts. No device uses the IETF-recommended 600 seconds. In this context, UDP keepalive intervals as short as 15 seconds, which are used by some applications, may be overly aggressive. The lowest measured timeout when a binding has seen bidirectional traffic is 54 seconds. It is clear that there is a variety of different behaviors among the tested devices, and the timeout applied to a binding depends more on the traffic pattern than on the port numbers used.

#### Parallel TCP Bindings
In Section 4.2, the lowest measured number of parallel TCP bindings to a single server port is 16, and even the "best" devices imposed a limit of approximately 1024, which is much smaller than the 16-bit port number space. A low number of permitted parallel bindings can interfere with important applications, such as web browsing. Modern browsers impose a limit on the number of concurrent connections to a DNS name, which has caused content providers to use multiple DNS names for a web server with one IP address. The intent of this practice is to circumvent the browser limit to improve performance.

#### TCP Binding Timeouts
TCP binding timeouts vary much more widely than UDP timeouts. Half the devices time out TCP bindings after less than 1 hour, which is much less than the IETF-recommended minimum of 124 minutes. This means that TCP stacks that implement the standardized minimum TCP keepalive interval of 2 hours [6] will not be able to reliably refresh TCP connections in many cases.

#### Additional Behaviors
Our experiments also exposed a few other interesting behaviors:
1. **MAC Address Usage**: Some devices use the same Ethernet MAC address for both their WAN and LAN ports. In a typical configuration, this should make no difference, but it required us to connect the WAN and LAN ports to physically different VLAN switches.
2. **TTL Field Handling**: Some devices do not decrement the IP time-to-live (TTL) field and few honor a "Record Route" IP option, which can interfere with network diagnostics and other uses of the TTL field.
3. **Unknown Transport Protocol Fallback**: It was unexpected to find that some devices fall back to only translating the IP header when they encounter an unknown transport protocol. This behavior raises an interesting question for future transport protocol design: Could this behavior be leveraged by avoiding dependencies on the IP layer (such as the pseudo-headers for checksum calculation) to improve the chances for un-encapsulated and un-relayed NAT traversal?

Finally, it is worth noting that no single home gateway consistently performs better than others across all tests, making it difficult for application designers to target a "better" subset of devices.

### Conclusions and Future Work

The results presented in this paper are a snapshot of an ongoing study, but already show interesting variations in home gateway behavior. The results cover 34 different home gateway models, but do not necessarily reflect how frequent the observed behaviors are in the deployed device base. We plan to expand the range of tests to investigate handling of TCP and IP options, measure the rate at which NATs create new bindings, conduct more extensive DNSSEC, queuing, and SCTP tests, and measure the success rates of STUN [27], TURN [18], and ICE [26]. We also plan to investigate the support for ECN [24], IPv6 [8], and various IP and TCP options.

We are also continuing to expand the range of home gateways in the testbed. All home gateways measured in this paper use an Ethernet interface for their uplink. We plan to extend this study to include already-donated DSL and cable modems, once a DSLAM (DSL access multiplexer) and a CMTS (cable modem termination system), which have been donated after preliminary versions of this study were presented, have been added to the testbed.

### Acknowledgments

Many of the home gateway devices were donated to the testbed, and we would like to sincerely thank all donors. The results presented in this paper are a snapshot of a study that is continuously being extended. Please contact the authors if you have suggestions for additional or improved tests, or if you can donate a spare, unused home gateway to the testbed—we will cover shipping.
