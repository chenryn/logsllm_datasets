### Key Exchange and Authentication in Security Protocols

#### JFK vs. IKEv2
JFK employs ciphersuites, similar to the SSL/TLS protocols [10], for its security mechanisms. In contrast, IKEv2 supports legacy authentication methods, such as pre-shared keys. By design, JFK does not support other authentication mechanisms, as discussed in Section 3. While it is feasible to implement such features (e.g., a variant of JFKr that can do this without compromising security), the added complexity does not justify their inclusion.

Apart from these main differences, there are several superficial distinctions, such as the "wire" format, which are more a matter of preference than fundamental protocol design. The authors of both proposals have collaborated on a joint draft [19] submitted to the IETF IPsec Working Group. This draft outlines a set of design options reflecting the differences between the two protocols. Concurrently, a unified proposal is being developed, combining properties from both JFK and IKEv2. This unified proposal aims to establish a security association within two round trips while providing DoS protection for the responder, allowing the responder to be almost completely stateless between the second and third messages.

#### Other Key Exchange Protocols

**Photuris [24]**
Photuris introduced the concept of cookies to counter "blind" denial of service attacks. The protocol consists of a 6-message exchange, similar to the Station to Station protocol. It shares similarities with IKE in message layout and purpose, but the SA information is moved to the third message. For re-keying, a two-message exchange can be used to request a unidirectional SPI, requiring four messages for complete re-keying. Photuris is vulnerable to computation-based DoS attacks, although one variant provides DoS protection via stateless cookies.

**SKEME [27]**
SKEME aligns with many of JFK's requirements and has influenced IKE's design. It serves as a set of protocol building blocks rather than a specific protocol instance. Depending on the key management requirements, these blocks can be combined in various ways. SKEME avoids digital signatures, using public key encryption instead for authentication, allowing both parties to repudiate the exchange.

**SKIP [5]**
SKIP was an early proposal for IPsec key management. It uses long-term Diffie-Hellman public keys to derive shared keys, which are then used to distribute session keys. The session key is encrypted with the long-term key and included in the packet header. While this scheme offers good synchronization for re-keying, the base version lacks Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS). PFS was later provided via an extension [4], but this detracts from SKIP's original properties. Additionally, SKIP does not provide identity protection, as the certificates used to verify the Diffie-Hellman public keys are publicly available, and the master identities are included in each packet, making it susceptible to DoS attacks.

**Host Identity Payload (HIP) [38]**
HIP uses cryptographic public keys as host identifiers and introduces protocols for establishing SAs in IPsec. The HIP protocol involves a four-packet exchange and uses client puzzles to limit the number of sessions an attacker can initiate. HIP allows for the reuse of the Diffie-Hellman value over time to handle high session rates. For re-keying, a HIP packet protected by an existing IPsec session is used. HIP does not provide identity protection and relies on out-of-band mechanisms for distributing keys and certificates, or additional HIP messages, increasing the effective message count to six or eight.

### Conclusion
Over the years, numerous key exchange protocols have been proposed, some with security flaws and others failing to meet certain requirements. JFK addresses these issues through simplicity and a proof of correctness. We argue that new protocols should not be deployed without such an analysis. The details of JFK were refined to accommodate the proof, emphasizing the importance of simplicity in design to avoid implementation errors and interoperability issues.

The requirements issue is more challenging due to the evolving nature of threat models and operational needs. For example, StS is unsuitable for environments where DoS attacks are a concern. Identity protection is another recent requirement, but the exact needs and threat models are still unclear, leading to the development of both JFKi and JFKr.

Finally, we show that attributes often considered essential, such as DoS-resistance and PFS, are subject to cost-benefit analysis. By treating some aspects as parameters rather than absolutes, it is possible to improve other aspects of the protocol, such as reducing the number of round trips required.

We thank Ran Atkinson, Matt Crawford, Paul Hoffman, and Eric Rescorla for their valuable comments. Discussions with Hugo Krawczyk were particularly useful. Dan Harkins suggested including IPI in the authenticator, and David Wagner provided suggestions on the format of Message (2) in JFKi. The design of JFKr was influenced by the SIGMA and IKEv2 protocols.
