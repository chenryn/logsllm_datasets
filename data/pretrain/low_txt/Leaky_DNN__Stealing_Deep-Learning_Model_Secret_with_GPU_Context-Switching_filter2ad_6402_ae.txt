### Information Leakage in DNN Model Training on Shared GPUs

We have identified a potential security vulnerability related to information leakage when training Deep Neural Network (DNN) models on shared GPUs. Our findings indicate that the context-switching penalty of GPUs can be exploited by an attacker to obtain detailed information about another CUDA application, including DNN operations and hyperparameters.

#### Exploitation Techniques
- **Active Slow-Down Attack**: By deliberately slowing down the GPU, an attacker can create conditions that allow for more precise timing measurements.
- **Passive Inference with LSTM Models**: Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, we can infer the characteristics of the DNN being trained, achieving high accuracy in these attack tasks.

#### Future Work
In future work, we plan to test potential defenses against these attacks. We also call upon the community and stakeholders to develop new protection mechanisms to mitigate this risk.
