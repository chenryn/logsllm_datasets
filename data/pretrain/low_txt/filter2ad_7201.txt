## Abstract
We present a demonstration of WTF (Where’s The Fault?), a system designed to localize performance issues in home and access networks. Implemented as custom firmware on off-the-shelf home routers, WTF uses timing and buffering information from passively monitored traffic to detect both access link and wireless network bottlenecks.

## 1. Introduction
We have developed an algorithm and tool, named WTF (Where’s The Fault?), which determines whether network performance bottlenecks lie inside or outside the home network. Running on commodity home routers, WTF detects access link and wireless bottlenecks by analyzing timing and buffering information from passively monitored traffic. This data is used to design two maximum likelihood detectors: one for access link bottlenecks and another for wireless network bottlenecks. These detectors help infer the most likely location of performance problems, though they do not identify the root cause. 

To maximize deployment, we implemented WTF as custom firmware for off-the-shelf home routers. While this approach leverages familiar, low-cost devices, it also presents challenges due to resource constraints. Existing bottleneck detection and wireless analysis tools often require multiple vantage points and extensive trace collection, which are impractical in this environment. WTF addresses these limitations by collecting lightweight passive measurements and performing minimal data processing on the router.

## 2. Detection Algorithm
WTF exploits the fundamental property that packets buffer at the head of a bottleneck queue. This property manifests differently depending on the bottleneck's location.

### Access Link Bottleneck
Bottleneck links smooth packet arrival rates. When a bottleneck link services packets at a rate slower than their arrival, queues build up, and the link paces packets evenly. Upstream of the bottleneck, packet inter-arrival times show high variance due to TCP congestion control, while downstream, the variance is lower due to buffer smoothing.

Figure 1 illustrates this effect:
- **(a)** Access link is not the bottleneck: High variance in packet inter-arrival times.
- **(b)** Access link is the bottleneck: Steady throughput with uniform packet inter-arrival times.

### Wireless Bottleneck
If the wireless link is the bottleneck, the TCP round-trip time (RTT) between the router and clients increases due to buffering. We use `tcptrace` to measure RTT. If the wireless link is not the bottleneck, RTT is low; otherwise, it is significantly higher.

Figure 2 shows this effect:
- **(a)** Access link is the bottleneck: Low RTT (about 5 ms).
- **(b)** Wireless link is the bottleneck: High RTT (about 25–30 ms).

### Combining Detectors
We combine the access link and wireless link detectors using a simple threshold-based algorithm (Figure 3):
- **Access Link Threshold Breached:** Access link is the bottleneck.
- **Wireless Threshold Breached:** Wireless link is the bottleneck.
- **Neither Thresholds Breached:** Bottleneck is elsewhere or demand is insufficient.
- **Both Thresholds Breached:** Access and wireless throughputs are closely matched.

In our experiments, thresholds for the coefficient of variation (cv) and RTT (τ) were set to 0.8 and 15 ms, respectively, achieving over 95% true positive detection and less than 5% false negative rates.

## 3. Demonstration Details
In our demo, we will showcase WTF on a commodity home router. The setup (Figure 4) includes traffic controllers to vary bandwidth, latency, and loss in the end-to-end path. The tool's front-end is a web page hosted on the router, displaying the current state of the access link and wireless clients. Detailed information about wireless network performance (bitrates, retransmission rates, etc.) will be provided to better understand client performance. The demo can be conducted without an upstream Internet connection but is enhanced with one, allowing more realistic scenarios.
