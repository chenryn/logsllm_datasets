### Shadow Files and Data Persistence

Shadow files are utilized for reading unchanged data from the shared system image. These files are recreated at each boot, meaning any modifications made by the user to the startup volume are lost upon restart. For example, if a user saves a document to the startup volume, it will be deleted after a restart. This behavior ensures that the environment remains in the state set up by the administrator. Therefore, it is recommended that users store their documents on a network file server.

### Balancing the Shadow File Load

NetBoot creates an Apple Filing Protocol (AFP) share point on each specified server volume (refer to “Choosing Where Shadow Files Are Stored” on page 35) and distributes client shadow files across these points to balance the load for NetBoot clients. There is no performance benefit if the volumes are partitions on the same disk. For more details, see “Distributing Shadow Files” on page 47.

**Warning:** Do not rename a NetBoot share point or the volume on which it resides. Additionally, do not use Workgroup Manager to stop sharing for a NetBoot share point unless you first deselect the share point for images and shadow files in Server Admin.

### Allocation of Shadow Files for Mac OS X NetBoot Clients

When a client computer boots from a Mac OS X boot image, it creates its shadow files on a server's `NetBootClientsn` share point. If no share point is available, the shadow files are created on a local drive. For information on changing this behavior, see “Changing How Mac OS X NetBoot Clients Allocate Shadow Files” on page 24.

### NetBoot Image Folders

A NetBoot image folder contains the necessary files for a client computer to start up over the network. The folder name has the suffix “.nbi.” The contents differ slightly between Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X due to the different startup requirements.

#### Mac OS X NetBoot Image Folder

- **booter**: Boot file
- **mach.macosx**: UNIX kernel
- **mach.macosx.mkext**: Drivers
- **System.dmg**: Startup image file (may include application software)
- **NBImageInfo.plist**: Property list file

#### Mac OS 9 NetBoot Image Folder

- **Mac OS ROM**: Boot file
- **NetBoot HD.img**: System startup image file
- **Application HD.img**: Application image file
- **NBImageInfo.plist**: Property list file
- **Backup**: Folder created by NetBoot Desktop Admin for the backup image

### Creating and Modifying NetBoot Images

- **Mac OS X NBI Folders**: Use Network Image Utility to set up Mac OS X NBI folders. This utility allows you to:
  - Name the image
  - Choose the image type (NetBoot or Network Install)
  - Provide an image ID
  - Choose the default language
  - Specify a default user name and password
  - Enable automatic installation for install images
  - Add additional packages or preinstalled applications

- **Mac OS 9 NBI Folders**: Use NetBoot Desktop Admin to modify the Mac OS 9 NBI folder. This utility lets you change the image file (`NetBoot HD.img`), adjust the image size, and add software to the application image.

### Property List File

The property list file (`NBImageInfo.plist`) stores image properties. Initial values are set by the tools used to work with the image files, and typically do not need to be changed directly. Some values are set by Server Admin. If editing is required, you can use TextEdit or Property List Editor, found in the Utilities folder on the Mac OS X Server Administration Tools CD.

#### Mac OS 9 Property List

- **BootFile**: Name of boot ROM file
- **Index**: Unique identifier (1–4095 for local images, 4096–65535 for load-balanced images)
- **IsDefault**: Specifies the default boot image
- **IsEnabled**: Sets whether the image is available to clients
- **IsInstall**: Specifies a Network Install image
- **Name**: Image name
- **Type**: Classic
- **SupportsDiskless**: Directs the NetBoot server to allocate space for diskless clients

#### Mac OS X Property List

- **BootFile**: Name of boot ROM file
- **Index**: Unique identifier (1–4095 for local images, 4096–65535 for load-balanced images)
- **IsDefault**: Specifies the default boot image
- **IsEnabled**: Sets whether the image is available to clients
- **IsInstall**: Specifies a Network Install image
- **Name**: Image name
- **RootPath**: Path to disk image on the server
- **Type**: NFS or HTTP
- **SupportsDiskless**: Directs the NetBoot server to allocate space for diskless clients
- **Description**: Arbitrary text describing the image
- **Language**: Code specifying the language to be used

### Boot Server Discovery Protocol (BSDP)

NetBoot uses the Boot Server Discovery Protocol (BSDP), a protocol based on DHCP, to discover NetBoot servers on a network. BSDP provides built-in support for load balancing. See “Performance and Load Balancing” on page 45.

### BootP Server

NetBoot uses a BootP server (bootpd) to provide necessary information to client computers when they boot from an image on the server. To prevent the NetBoot BootP server from responding to IP address requests, add a key named `bootp_enabled` with no value to the directory `/config/dhcp` using NetInfo Manager.

### TFTP and Boot Files

NetBoot uses Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) to send boot files from the server to the client. The boot files are stored in `/Library/NetBoot/NetBootSPn/image.nbi` (where `n` is the volume number and `image` is the image name). For Mac OS 9, there is a single file named `Mac OS ROM`. For Mac OS X, there are three files: `booter`, `mach.macosx`, and `mach.macosx.mkext`.

### Using Images Stored on Other Servers

You can store Mac OS X boot or install images on NFS servers other than the NetBoot server itself. For more information, see “Using Images Stored on Other NFS Servers” on page 36.

### Security

You can restrict access to NetBoot services by listing the hardware (MAC) addresses of computers that you want to allow or deny. A client’s hardware address is automatically added to the NetBoot Filtering list when it starts up using NetBoot. For more information, see “Restricting NetBoot Clients by Filtering Addresses” on page 38.

### Before You Set Up NetBoot

Before setting up a NetBoot server, review the following considerations and requirements:

- **Network Configuration**: Be familiar with your network setup and DHCP services.
- **Client Computer Requirements**: Most Macintosh computers running Mac OS 9.2.2 or later can use NetBoot. Ensure you have the latest firmware updates.
- **RAM Requirements**: Minimum RAM requirements are 64 MB for Mac OS 9 and 128 MB for Mac OS X.
- **Software Updates**: Use the latest system software when creating NetBoot disk images.
- **Ethernet Support**: NetBoot is supported only over the built-in Ethernet connection.
- **Network Hardware**: The type of network connections depends on the number of clients.
- **Network Services**: Depending on the types of clients, your NetBoot server must provide DHCP, NFS, AFP, HTTP, and TFTP services.

### NetBoot and AirPort

The use of AirPort wireless technology for NetBoot clients is not supported and is discouraged.
