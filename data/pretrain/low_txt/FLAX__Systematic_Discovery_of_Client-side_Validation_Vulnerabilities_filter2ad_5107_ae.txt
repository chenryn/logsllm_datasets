### Permitted by Browser’s Same-Origin Policy

The attacker's payload and the gadget's iframe principal are identical, which is permitted by the browser's same-origin policy.

### Google/iGoogle Security Design

Google/iGoogle is designed such that each iGoogle gadget operates as a separate security principal, hosted at a subdomain of `http://gmodules.com`. This design mitigates the risk of an attacker who compromises one gadget from gaining access to sensitive data on the `google.com` domain. In the past, Barth et al. described a related attack called "gadget hijacking," where attackers could steal sensitive data by navigating the gadget frame to a malicious site [7]. They proposed new browser frame navigation policies to prevent such attacks. Gadget overwriting attacks, resulting from CSV vulnerabilities in vulnerable gadgets, can also allow attackers to achieve similar objectives, which were addressed by the defenses proposed by Barth et al. [7].

### Gadget Overwriting Attack Example

**Figure 11.** A gadget overwriting attack layered on a CSV vulnerability. The user clicks on an untrusted link, which displays the iGoogle web page with an overwritten iGoogle gadget. The URL bar continues to show the iGoogle web page.

### Cookie-Sink Vulnerabilities

FLAX reported a cookie corruption vulnerability in one of AskAWord's iGoogle gadgets, which provides the AskAWord.com dictionary and spell checker service. FLAX noted that the cookie data could be corrupted with arbitrary data, and additional cookie attributes could be injected, classifying it as a low-severity vulnerability. However, further analysis revealed that the gadget used the cookie to store the user's history of previous searches, which was echoed back in the server's HTML response without any client-side or server-side validation. We informed the developers about the cookie attribute injection and the reflected XSS vulnerability through the cookie channel, and they patched the vulnerability on the same day.

### Application Command Injection

One vulnerability reported by FLAX for the AjaxIM chat application indicated that untrusted data from an input text box could be used to inject application commands. AjaxIM uses untrusted data to construct a URL that directs application-specific commands to its backend server using XMLHttpRequest. These commands include adding/deleting chat rooms, adding/deleting friends, and changing the user's profile. FLAX discovered a vulnerability where unsanitized input from an input-box is used to construct the URL that sends a GET request command to join a chat room. An attacker can exploit this by injecting new parameters (key-value pairs) into the URL. For example, a benign command request URL to join a chat room named 'friends' in AjaxIM is `ajaxim.php?call=joinroom&room=friends`. By providing a room name as `friends&call=addbuddy&buddy=evil`, the value of the `call` command is overridden from `joinroom` to a command that adds an untrusted user (called "evil") to the victim's friend list. The severity of this vulnerability is limited, as it does not allow a remote attacker to exploit the bug without additional social engineering. However, we informed the developers, and they acknowledged the concern, agreeing to fix the vulnerability.

### Related Work

#### Server-Side Vulnerabilities

XSS, SQL injection, directory traversal, cross-site request forgery, and command injection have been the most significant web vulnerabilities in recent years [36]. Techniques including static analyses [22, 24], model checking [28], mixed static-dynamic analyses [4], and decision procedure-based automated analyses [21, 25] have been developed for server-side applications written in PHP and Java. Among these, only a few works have aimed to precisely analyze custom validation routines. Balzarotti et al. identified that the use of custom sanitization could be a significant source of both false positives and negatives for analysis tools in their work on Saner [4]. Their approach used static techniques for reasoning about multiple paths effectively but was limited to a subset of string functions and ignored validation checks that manifest as conditional constraints on the execution path. Although an area of active research, more recent string decision procedures do not yet support the full generality of constraints observed in JavaScript subject applications [9, 21, 25].

#### Dynamic Taint Analysis Approaches

Vogt et al. developed taint-analysis techniques for JavaScript to study confidentiality attacks resulting from XSS vulnerabilities [39]. Our taint-tracking techniques are character-level precise and accurately model the semantics of string operations, which is required in our application domain. Purely dynamic taint-based approaches have been used for runtime defense against web attacks [18, 29, 32, 35, 37, 38, 43]. However, applying these to discover attacks is difficult because reasoning about validation checks is crucial for precision. Tools like PHPTaint [38] approximate this by implicitly clearing the taint when data is sanitized using a built-in sanitization routine.

#### Directed Random Testing

Our taint-enhanced blackbox fuzzing technique shares some benefits with taint-based directed whitebox fuzzing [15]. Both techniques use taint information to narrow down the space of relevant inputs; however, our technique uses knowledge of the sink to perform a directed black-box analysis for the vulnerability, as opposed to their white-box analysis. Techniques developed in this paper are related to dynamic symbolic execution-based approaches [11, 12, 16, 21], which use decision procedures to explore the program space of the application. As discussed earlier, automated decision procedures for the theory of strings do not support the expressiveness to directly solve practical constraints observed in real JavaScript applications. In comparison, our taint-enhanced blackbox fuzzing algorithm is a lighter-weight mechanism that efficiently combines the benefits of taint-based analyses with randomized testing to overcome the limitations of decision-procedure-based tools.

#### JavaScript Analysis Frameworks

Several works have recently applied static analysis to JavaScript applications [14, 17]. In contrast, we demonstrate the practical effectiveness of a complementary dynamic analysis technique and explain the benefits of our analyses over their static counterparts. GateKeeper enforces a different set of policies using static techniques, which may lead to false positives. Recent frameworks for dynamic analyses [44] have been proposed for source-level instrumentation for JavaScript, but source-level transformations are much harder to reason about in practice due to the complexity of the JavaScript language.

#### Browser Vulnerabilities

CSV vulnerabilities are related to, but significantly different from, browser vulnerabilities [5, 7, 13, 41]. Research on these vulnerabilities has largely focused on better designs of interfaces that could be used securely by mutually untrusted principals. In this paper, we showed how web application developers use these abstractions, such as inter-frame communication interfaces, in an insecure way.

### Conclusion

This paper presents a new class of vulnerabilities, which we call CSV vulnerabilities. We proposed a hybrid approach to automatically test JavaScript applications for the presence of these vulnerabilities. We implemented our approach in a prototype tool called FLAX. FLAX has discovered several real-world bugs, suggesting that such tools are valuable resources for security analysts and developers of rich web applications today. Results from running FLAX provide key insights into the prevalence of this class of CSV vulnerabilities with empirical examples, and point out several implicit assumptions and programming errors that JavaScript developers make.
