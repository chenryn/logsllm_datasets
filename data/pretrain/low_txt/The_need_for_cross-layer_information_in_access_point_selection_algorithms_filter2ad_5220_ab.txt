### Traffic Load and Access Point (AP) Selection Stress Testing

To stress test specific dimensions of the AP selection problem, we distribute traffic loads across both APs and clients. We then introduce a new client into the environment and measure the following three metrics with respect to two candidate APs:

1. **Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)**
2. **Aggregated Transmission Delay (ATD)**
3. **Access Point Capacity (APC)**

The client is instructed to affiliate with each of the two candidate APs. For each association, a 4 Mbps Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic stream is sent from the chosen AP to the client for 60 seconds, with a packet size of 1500 bytes. We record the resulting throughput and identify the AP that offers the best performance. We then compare these results with the AP selections that would have been made using each individual metric:
- The AP with the highest RSSI
- The AP with the lowest ATD
- The AP with the highest APC

Most experiments focus on downlink traffic, as it is the dominant mode of wireless usage (most servers still reside in the wired infrastructure). However, we have also conducted uplink experiments, and the trends and observations are consistent with the downlink results. All experiments are performed in the evening when no other wireless activity occurs in the building.

### Limitations of the Testbed

Our testbed uses prototype APs with modifiable wireless cards. These wireless adaptors do not support per-client rate adaptation, a feature available in commercial APs. Throughout the experiments, we use a fixed rate of 11 Mbps, which results in an effective maximum throughput of 5 Mbps. The lack of rate adaptation means the link's effective rate cannot adapt to the quality of the wireless channel. This limitation does not affect the APC metric but influences the representativeness of RSSI and ATD metrics in reflecting user throughput. To mitigate this, our first three experimental topologies restrict the communication channel quality to regions where rate adaptation is not required. We also saturate the channel so that good quality links can be used at their maximum rate. A separate experiment focuses on uplink traffic to test the effect of rate adaptation, leveraging the clients' ability to perform this function.

### Experiment 1: RSSI

**Setup Summary:**
- One AP is closer to the new client but has an associated client and co-channel interference.
- The other AP is farther away but has no associated clients or interference.

**Experiment Details:**
We deploy three APs in an office environment. Two APs (AP1 and AP2) operate on the same frequency and each has one client receiving traffic at a constant rate of 4 Mbps. The third AP (AP3) operates on an orthogonal frequency and has no associated clients. The path loss from the new client (C2) to AP1 is smaller than to AP3. If the affiliation algorithm were based solely on signal strength, C2 would select AP1. We instruct C2 to affiliate with AP1 and AP3 in turn and measure the throughput achieved by a 4 Mbps CBR stream sent from the AP to the client. Table 1 lists the values for the different candidate metrics observed by the client with respect to the two candidate APs, as well as the resulting throughput. The throughput obtained from affiliating with AP3 is 25% higher than with AP1, despite AP1 having a higher RSSI. Table 2 shows the decisions that the other two metrics would have led to if used in the affiliation decision. The impact of the co-channel AP and existing traffic is greater than the lower RSSI with respect to AP3.

### Experiment 2: Aggregated Transmission Delay

**Setup Summary:**
- One AP has no clients but faces co-channel interference and is farther away from the new client.
- The other AP is closer but has an associated client receiving moderate traffic.

**Experiment Details:**
The second topology, shown in Figure 1(b), focuses on the performance of the ATD metric. ATD is affected by the number of clients and their transmission delays. The client (C3) has two affiliation choices: AP1 or AP3. AP1 operates on channel 10 and features co-channel AP2 with client C2 constantly receiving traffic at 4 Mbps. AP3 operates on an orthogonal frequency and sends traffic to its associated client at 1 Mbps. The link quality from C3 to AP1 is worse than to AP3. Affiliating C3 with each AP in turn leads to the results reported in Table 1. The throughput achieved by affiliating with AP3 is six times higher than with AP1. The ATD for AP1 is zero since it has no clients, but the co-channel AP with high workload and poor link quality leads to very poor throughput.

### Experiment 3: AP Capacity

**Setup Summary:**
- One AP is closer to the new client and has no associated clients but faces co-channel interference from a busy AP.
- The other AP faces no interference but is farther away and has an associated client.

**Experiment Details:**
The third topology, shown in Figure 1(c), tests the performance of the APC metric. AP1 and AP2 operate on the same channel, with AP2 sending traffic to C3 at 2 Mbps. AP3 operates on an orthogonal channel and sends traffic to C4 at 4 Mbps. The signal quality to AP1 is better than to AP3. The APC reported by AP1 is smaller than that of AP3 due to the co-channel AP. If the client affiliates with the AP that occupies the medium for the greatest amount of time, it obtains half the throughput compared to affiliating with AP1 (Table 1). The impact of lower RSSI and contending clients is greater than the impact of lesser capacity by AP1. Note that the capacity is not significantly low since AP2 sends a light traffic stream to C3 and is far from AP1.

### Experiment 4: RSSI (Uplink)

**Setup Summary:**
- One AP is closer to the new client but has an associated client sending traffic in the uplink direction.
- The other AP has no associated clients but is farther away.

**Experiment Details:**
The topology in Figure 1(d) focuses on the performance of the RSSI metric in the uplink direction, where clients have the capability for rate adaptation. This is the only experiment using 802.11g due to its wider range of transmission rates. Client C2 has two affiliation options: (i) AP1, which receives traffic from client C1 at 18 Mbps, and (ii) AP3, which is farther away but has no clients. Affiliating C2 with the closest AP1 results in a 33% loss in throughput due to the existing client (Table 1). Affiliating with the slightly worse quality AP3 can lead to better performance in the presence of rate adaptation. While this was observed in downlink experiments, the impact of the wrong decision is greater in the uplink because clients can adapt their rates, reducing the impact of poor channel quality.

### Toward a More Inclusive Metric: Expected Throughput

From the above experiments, it is clear that none of the individual metrics can consistently make the right association decision under all circumstances. This is because a single metric cannot capture all factors influencing throughput performance. According to Section 2, we can estimate the long-term throughput of a client based on all three metrics. We call this new metric "Expected Throughput" (ET). The ET metric for a client \( u \) with respect to an access point \( a \) is given by:

\[
\text{ET}(a, u) = \frac{\text{APC}(a)}{\text{ATD}(a) + d(u)}
\]

where:
- \(\text{APC}(a)\) is the capacity of \( a \)
- \(\text{ATD}\) is the aggregated transmission delay as reported by the AP
- \( d(u) \) is the estimated transmission delay for a data unit by client \( u \) based on RSSI

Equation 2 does not include \( T \) due to the dependence of our measurement reference period on the transmission/reception events for each AP (Section 3). The weighted moving average nature of APC and ATD still provides a common basis for comparison across APs. This limitation stems from the sensitivity of the firmware code to sustain continuous measurements. Upon calculating the ET metric for different APs, the client will decide to affiliate with the AP that features the highest ET value.

The results for the ET metric are shown in Tables 1 and 2. It is clear that the ET metric makes the right decision in all four experiments, confirming its effectiveness. However, it must be noted that the ET metric relies on two key assumptions: the use of rate adaptation and saturated downlink traffic. In the absence of these, modifications will be required.

### The Impact of Rate Adaptation

The ET metric assumes that the transmission rate and hence the aggregated transmission delay is a function of the RSSI, which in turn assumes the use of some form of rate adaptation. While the ET metric is a good throughput indicator in uplink experiments where rate scaling is implemented, we found that it was also a good indicator in all downlink experiments.
