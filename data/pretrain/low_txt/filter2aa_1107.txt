## Overview
- SMB/CIFS Refresher
- Windows Permissions Refresher (DACLs, SDDL, ACEs, etc.)
- The Problem with Scanning Today
- What Share Scanning Is Good For
- Tools!

## Windows File Sharing
- **CIFS (Common Internet File System)**
  - Essentially SMB 1.0
  - Mostly open and is the published specification that others implement
- **SMB (Server Message Block)**
  - SMB 1.0: Windows XP, Server 2003 R2, and Prior
  - SMB 2.0: Windows Vista, Server 2008, and Above
  - SMB 2.1: Windows 7, Server 2008 R2, and Above
  - SMB 3.0: Windows 8, Server 2012, and Above
  - SMB 3.02: Windows 8.1, Server 2012 R2

## Types of Shares
- **Special Types of Shares (IPC$, ADMIN$, C$)**
  - **$ = Hidden… usually**
    - **IPC$**: Inter-Process Communication
    - **ADMIN$**: C:\Windows\System32
    - **C$, D$, etc.**: Drive Shares
  - These are default and rarely removed, although they can be disabled (see [Microsoft KB 954422](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/954422))

## Share Permissions
- **Discretionary Access Control List (DACL)**
  - Example: `REVISION:1,OWNER:2K8-WIN7-01\ShareEnumUser1, GROUP:PROD\Domain Users, ACL:2K8\shareenumdomuser1:0/16/0x001f01ff`
- **Access Control Entry (ACE)**
  - Example: `BUILTIN\Administrators:0/0/0x001f01ff`

### Permissions Levels
- **Read**
  - View files and folders
  - View file and folder contents
- **Change**
  - Add files and folders
  - Change data in files
  - Delete folders and files
- **Full Control**
  - Change NTFS permissions
  - Modify
  - Read & Execute
  - List Folder Contents
  - Write
  - Special Permissions

### Special Permissions
- Traverse Folder/Execute File
- List Folder/Read Data
- Read Attributes
- Read Extended Attributes
- Create Files/Write Data
- Create Folders/Append Data
- Write Attributes
- Write Extended Attributes
- Delete Subfolders and Files
- Delete
- Read Permissions
- Change Permissions
- Take Ownership

### Attributes
- **READONLY**
- **HIDDEN**
- **SYSTEM**
- **ARCHIVE**
- **TEMPORARY**
- **COMPRESSED (Directory Only)**
- **OFFLINE**
- **NOT_CONTENT_INDEXED**

### Extended Attributes
- Custom and starting to be used in Windows 8

### Access Masks
- **Generic Access Rights**
- **Standard Access Rights**
- **File and Directory Access Rights**
- **DOS Mode Flags**: Read Only, Hidden

## The Problem with Current Tools
- **Current tools have a variety of issues:**
  - Do not support all authentication mechanisms (NTLMv2, NTLMSSP)
  - Can be very noisy, leading to detection
  - Slow
  - Only pull information at the top level of the share

## Why We Scan Shares
- **Sensitive Data (Obviously!)**
  - \HR
  - \IT
  - \Backups
  - \Source
- **System Fingerprinting**
  - What kind of shares does this system have?
  - What does that tell us about the system?
- **Reconnaissance**
  - NETLOGON & SYSVOL
  - Windows Deployment Services
  - Images and Credentials
- **Credential Reuse**
  - Is the local administrator password reused?
  - Do all systems have their local administrator renamed to “AdminWhatAdmin” with the same password?
  - Does the local “ITHelpDesk” account exist everywhere with a known password?
- **Local Administrator Access**
  - Where do I have admin access on a box?
  - Does “Domain Users” have admin access somewhere?
  - What about a single user?

## Share Scanning Tools
- **Nmap NSE (smb-enum-shares)**
- **SysInternal’s ShareEnum**
- **Nessus**
- **Metasploit**
- **SMBClient**
- **WinShareEnum (GitHub: nccgroup/WinShareEnum)**
- **Manually through Explorer or net use**

## Our Tool
- **Why Implement Our Own Protocols?**
  - Someone else already has: Samba.
  - We use the same libraries as smbclient, but it's much faster to go native than to parse command line output.
  - Supports the same authentication methods as Samba (NTLMv2, NTLMSSP).
- **Features**
  - Gathers DACLs and parses ACEs for each object
  - Recursively loads subdirectories and files
  - CSV output for easy filtering
  - Supports Anonymous, Regular Credentials, and Pass the Hash

## Demos
- **Demo 1: Local Administrator Password Reuse**
- **Demo 2: Sensitive Shares**
- **Demo 3: Recursively Enumerating a Share**

## Additional Notes
- If you know about the Samba RPC and IDL code, we’d love to buy you a beer.
