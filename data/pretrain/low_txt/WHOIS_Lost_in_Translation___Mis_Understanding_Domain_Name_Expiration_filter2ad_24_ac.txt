### 4.68 Million .com Domains: Re-Registration Analysis

For the re-registration analysis, we adjust the expiration date of domains in the "auto-renew" interval by subtracting one year. We only use the first and last observed Whois responses for each domain. The final lookup result is either "domain not found," indicating no re-registration, or a valid record containing the creation date of the new re-registration instance.

### 3.5 Limitations

Our study focuses on domains removed from zone files, thus excluding those that are registered but do not appear in DNS zones, such as domains not intended to resolve. Manually deleted domains are also excluded, as their deletion may be unrelated to the expiration date, which is the basis for our re-registration analysis. We only analyze domains that go through the redemption and pending delete periods, ensuring they are removed from the DNS zone. This approach does not account for private domain sales or auctions that result in ownership transfers without going through the expiration, deletion, and re-registration cycles, as these transfers may keep the domain active in the DNS zone with the original creation date in the Whois data. However, our method can quantify re-registrations regardless of whether the domain re-appears in the DNS zone, using Whois signals for detection.

### 4. Re-Registration Analysis

In our measurement, we added samples of domains removed from DNS zones daily over seven months and tracked them for ten months. From a statistical perspective, our re-registration data is right-censored because the observation period varies for different domains. To handle this, we use survival analysis, specifically the Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimator [14].

The survival function \( S(t) \) represents the probability that an expired domain has not been re-registered after time \( t \). We define the random variable \( T \) as the time between a domain's expiration date and its next creation date. This definition includes the period when the domain has expired but is not yet available for re-registration due to being in the auto-renew, redemption, or pending delete state. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of \( T \) is denoted as \( F(t) \), and the survival function is defined as:

\[ S(t) = P[T > t] = 1 - F(t) \]

The KM estimator makes no assumptions about the distribution of re-registration delays. It uses the set of observed re-registration delays and, for censored data, the set of non-re-registration time spans (i.e., from the expiration date to the most recent "domain not found" Whois observation).

### Overall Re-Registration Delay

Figure 3 shows the survival functions for the five zones. Smaller zones exhibit lower re-registration rates. The most popular zone, .com, has a re-registration rate of about 20% after 300 days. Interestingly, re-registered domains tend to be re-registered early. All zones show a spike in re-registrations just before day 80, which corresponds to the maximum deletion delay (45 days in auto-renew, 30 in redemption, and 5 in pending delete). This suggests that registrants take over expired domains as soon as possible.

### Earliest Re-Registrations

Immediate re-registration of deleted domains is the core business of drop-catch services. These services, fully automated and in direct competition, attempt to "catch" a domain as soon as it "drops." Our data shows the steepest increase in re-registrations on days 78 and 79, likely due to registrars deleting domains a few days early to avoid renewal fees.

### Re-Registrations by Prior Age

To predict which expired domains are more likely to be re-registered, we analyzed the survival function for .com domains based on their prior registration age. Figure 4 illustrates that longer-registered domains are more likely to be re-registered. For example, a domain registered for nine or more years is about three times more likely to be re-registered than one not renewed after its initial year. Longer registration periods may indicate higher desirability and established online reputation, making the domain valuable for various purposes, including spamming, exploitation of residual trust, and domain speculation.

### 5. Discussion & Conclusions

Initially, we expected quantifying re-registration probabilities and delays to be straightforward, with the main challenge being large-scale Whois data collection. However, domain names can expire in various ways, and variations in how sponsoring registrars implement expiration flows make it challenging to predict the time between expiration and deletion. Some domain states are not visible in Whois data, leading to potential misinterpretations. A well-defined, consistent format for Whois data and a public audit trail of domain state modifications would improve the accuracy and reliability of such studies.
