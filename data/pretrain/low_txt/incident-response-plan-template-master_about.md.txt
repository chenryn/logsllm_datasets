# About
This template was developed by the team at [Counteractive Security](https://www.counteractive.net) to help organizations of all sizes and types create a concise, directive, specific, flexible, and free incident response plan. Our goal is to provide you with a [plan that you will actually use](https://www.counteractive.net/posts/an-ir-plan-you-will-use/) to respond effectively, minimize costs and impact, and resume normal operations as quickly as possible.
