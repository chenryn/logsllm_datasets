### Welcome to DEF CON 20

We are excited to have this opportunity to share some ideas about advancing incident response, forensics, and penetration testing. It is an honor and a privilege to present to the DEF CON audience. Our mission is to inspire network defenders and attackers to work more closely together to improve each other's skills. 

We will conclude the session with a group hug and a few rounds of "Kumbaya," but first, we will introduce ourselves, our methods, and the challenges we aim to address. We will provide a quick, advanced introduction to the forensics methodology we call "Sniper Forensics" and discuss our contributions to what we call the "Real-World Penetration Testing" movement. Next, we will demonstrate how we apply these ideas by stepping through sample attacks that both exemplify and do not exemplify our methods. Finally, we will wrap up with the hugs and songs.

### State of Incident Response and Forensics

- **Mindset Shift**: We are fighting an uphill battle to change the mindset of the digital forensic discipline.
- **Skillsets**: Law enforcement officers excel at their roles, while we excel at being computer engineers. Occasionally, we find hybridsâ€”law enforcement professionals who are tech-savvy.
- **Evolving Data**: New systems mean new attacks, which require continuous research. If we haven't seen it before, we must adapt and learn.
- **Proof of Concept**: Collaborative exercises with penetration testers open up forensics to the broader world of digital investigation.

### State of Penetration Testing

- **Exploit Focus**: We are overly reliant on "sploits," which I use to refer to exploits that take advantage of memory corruption bugs. About 75% of the content under the exploit tree in Metasploit falls into this category. I am redefining "exploit" to mean all other types of vulnerabilities. This usage runs counter to current trends, but I believe it is important because language shapes our reality.
- **Focus on Exploits**: I will argue that we can largely ignore "sploits" and focus on other types of exploits.
- **Testing Methodology**: The way we scope, perform, and document penetration tests is pushing us further away from modeling real-world attacks.
- **OPFOR Concept**: The idea of OPFOR (Opposing Force) was inspired by a project to catalog SpiderLabs' most successful internal network attack techniques. A presentation by Tim Crothers on a live C&C server showed a high degree of overlap between the attacker's methods and the recommended techniques, leading to the development of the OPFOR concept.

When I explained my idea to Chris, he said, "Oh, OPFOR. Cool." For those unfamiliar, OPFOR is a term used in military training to refer to a red team. I had to look it up, but I learned that it is a common concept in US Army training manuals.
