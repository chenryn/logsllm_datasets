## Disclaimer & About Us
We are not medical doctors; our expertise lies in coffee drinking. Last year, we presented "Café Latte with free topping of cracked WEP." This year, we will share interesting observations about Wireless LAN (WLAN) behavior, some of which have parallels with known medical conditions.

## Introduction
### What is Autoimmunity Disorder?
An autoimmune disorder occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body cells. In the context of WLANs, this can be likened to an Access Point (AP) mistakenly attacking and disconnecting authorized clients.

### Why It Caught Our Attention
During late-night coding and debugging sessions, we observed instances where APs exhibited self-destructive behavior, similar to an autoimmune disorder. This behavior can lead to new avenues for launching Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

## Background
### Known DoS from External Sources
It is well-known that sending spoofed De-authentication or Disassociation packets can break the connection between an AP and a client. For example:
- A De-authentication packet with the source address set to the AP's MAC address causes disconnection in the client's state machine.
- A De-authentication packet with the source address set to the client's MAC address causes disconnection in the AP's state machine.

### New Self-DoS Triggered by External Stimuli
There exist malformed packets that, when injected, can turn an AP into a connection-killing machine. We will demonstrate eight examples of this behavior. The standard protocol specifications are often unclear on how APs should respond to malformed frames, leading to different behaviors across implementations. Some APs survive, some crash, and some become self-destructive.

## Test Setup
### WLAN Test Lab
To test for autoimmunity disorders in WLANs, the following setup is required:
- A raw frame injection tool (e.g., wireshark-inject)
- A wireless LAN card (preferably 802.11abg) connected to a BackTrack 2 Linux box
- An operational wireless LAN with at least one AP and a few clients

### Stimulus for Autoimmunity Disorder Tests
- **Association Request/Response, Re-association Request/Response, Authentication**
- **WLAN Address Fields:** Address1, Address2, Address3, Address4
- **Modified Information Elements (IEs)**

### Example Stimuli
1. **Broadcast MAC Address in Address 2 Field:**
   - Send a broadcast MAC address (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF) as the source MAC address in any class 2 or 3 frame.
   - The AP is likely to send a Deauthentication Notification frame with Reason Code “Class 3 frame received from nonassociated station.”
   - Associated stations honor the broadcast disconnection frame and disconnect from the AP.

2. **Multicast MAC Address in Address 2 Field:**
   - Send a multicast MAC address (01:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX) as the source MAC address in any class 2 or 3 frame.
   - The AP is likely to send a Disconnection Notification frame with Reason Code “Class 3 frame received from nonassociated station.”
   - All associated nodes honor the multicast disconnection notification and disconnect from the AP.

3. **4-MAC Address WLAN Frame:**
   - Send a 4-MAC address WDS DATA frame with the victim’s STA MAC as the source MAC address.
   - The AP, unable to handle 4-MAC address DATA frames, is likely to send a disconnection notification to the client.

4. **Spoofed Capabilities Field in Association Request:**
   - An Association Request with a spoofed Capabilities Field can drop the client’s connection at the AP and trigger a response with Status Code 10 (Cannot support all requested capabilities).

5. **Spoofed Current AP Address in Reassociation Request:**
   - A Reassociation Request with a spoofed Current AP Address can disconnect an associated client and trigger a response with Status Code 11 (Reassociation denied due to inability to confirm that association exists).

6. **Invalid Authentication Algorithm in Authentication Frame:**
   - An Authentication frame with an invalid Authentication Algorithm can disconnect an associated client and trigger a response with Status Code 13 (Responding station does not support the specified authentication algorithm).

7. **Invalid Authentication Transaction Sequence Number:**
   - An Authentication frame with an invalid Authentication Transaction Sequence Number can disconnect an associated client and trigger a response with Status Code 14 (Received an Authentication frame with authentication transaction sequence number out of expected sequence).

8. **Invalid BSS BasicRateSet Parameter in Association Request:**
   - An Association Request with an invalid BSS BasicRateSet parameter can disconnect an associated client and trigger a response with Status Code 18 (Association denied due to requesting station not supporting all of the data rates in the BSS BasicRateSet parameter).

## Autoimmunity Disorder Report
The report includes detailed results for various attack types and their impact on different AP models and firmware versions. Specific findings will be shared during the presentation.

## MFP (Management Frame Protection)
### Background
The root cause of disconnection-based DoS vulnerabilities in 802.11 is that management frames used for connection establishment and termination are not protected. MFP (802.11w) aims to solve this problem by protecting these frames.

### Autoimmunity Disorder in MFP Infrastructure
- **MFP-Enabled APs and Clients:**
  - Details on how MFP-protected APs and clients can still be vulnerable to autoimmunity disorders will be provided during the presentation.

## Key Takeaways
- **Without MFP Protection:**
  - New avenues for launching DoS attacks are possible. Most vulnerabilities are implementation-dependent and found in select open-source and commercial AP software.
- **With MFP Protection:**
  - DoS vulnerabilities could not be completely eliminated. Even MFP was found to be vulnerable.

## Food for Thought
A fix for MFP vulnerability has been attempted in the latest 11w draft, and future revisions will continue to raise the bar to make 802.11 more resistant to DoS attacks. Will the dream of an attack-proof 802.11 ever be realized?
