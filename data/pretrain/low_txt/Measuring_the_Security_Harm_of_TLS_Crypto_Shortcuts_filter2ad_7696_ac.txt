### Mail.ru Session Ticket Reuse

Mail.ru exhibited a 63-day session ticket reuse period, indicating that the session ticket was observed on both the first and last day of our study. This suggests that the session ticket was likely in use both before and after the study period.

### STEK Lifetimes and Alexa Rank Tiers

Figure 4 illustrates the variation in STEK lifetimes across different Alexa rank tiers, based on the average rank of each domain over a 9-week period. Our observations include:
- 56 domains in the Alexa Top 100
- 494 domains in the Top 1K
- 4,154 domains in the Top 10K
- 37,224 domains in the Top 100K
- 224,702 domains in the Alexa Top Million

These are only the domains that remained within the Alexa Top Million for the entire duration of our study.

### Factors Influencing STEK Longevity

The longevity of STEKs can be largely attributed to popular server implementations. For example, Apache 2.4.0 and Nginx 1.5.7 and later versions allow administrators to configure the server to read 48 bytes of randomness from a file path on disk. This file contains the STEK identifier, encryption key, and MAC key, enabling synchronization of STEKs across servers. This configuration can only be changed via direct administrative interaction and a server restart. If this option is not available or if a key file is not configured, the server generates a new STEK at startup and uses it for the lifetime of the process.

While some websites appeared to never rotate STEKs, many have more reasonable configurations. Notable examples include Google, Twitter, YouTube, Baidu, and others, which do not reuse an issuing STEK across days. However, as discussed in Section 7, this is not always the sole indicator of a secure configuration.

### Ephemeral Exchange Value Reuse

#### DHE and ECDHE Value Lifetime

As described in Section 2, TLS servers can cache and reuse ephemeral handshake values (e.g., \(a, g^a\) in finite-field Diffie-Hellman or \(d_A, d_A G\) in elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman) to reduce the computational cost of public key cryptography. Table 1 shows that 7.2% of domains in a single Alexa Top Million list reuse a DHE value, and 15.5% reuse an ECDHE value for some period.

To determine the persistence of these ephemeral values, we analyzed two sets of daily scans for the Top Million Domains. One set, obtained from the Censys project, offered only DHE ciphers, while the other offered ECDHE and RSA ciphers, with ECDHE as the first priority.

**DHE:**
- Of the 291,643 domains consistently in the Alexa Top Million and supporting HTTPS with a valid certificate, 166,608 (57%) connected successfully when the client offered only DHE ciphers.
- 12,824 domains (4.4%) reused a DHE value for some period in the 10 connection scans referenced in Table 1.
- 3,849 (1.3%) reused a DHE value for at least one day, 3,347 (1.2%) for at least 7 days, and 1,527 (0.52%) for 30 or more days.

Table 3 lists the top ten domains that reused a DHE value for more than 7 days, including commsec.com.au (an Australian brokerage firm) with 36 days of reuse and 32 kayak.[tld] domains with between 6 and 18 days of reuse.

**ECDHE:**
- 234,302 domains (80% of those consistently in the Alexa Top Million and supporting HTTPS with a valid certificate) completed an ECDHE handshake.
- 42,029 domains (14.4%) reused an ECDHE value for some period in the 10 connection scans.
- In our daily scans, 9,886 domains (3.4%) reused an ECDHE value for at least one day, 8,710 (3.0%) for at least 7 days, and 4,071 (1.4%) for 30 or more days.

Table 4 lists the top ten domains that reused an ECDHE value for more than 7 days, including betterment.com (an online investing service) and mint.com (a budgeting website) with 62 days of reuse, and symantec.com, symanteccloud.com, and norton.com with 41, 16, and 19 days of reuse, respectively.

Figure 5 visually represents the ephemeral value reuse, showing that the metrics are fairly consistent but differ significantly from the STEK longevity rates seen in Figure 3.

### TLS Secret State Sharing

When measuring the increased attack surface resulting from stored TLS secrets, it is important to consider cases where secrets are shared across domains, servers, or data centers. If a shared TLS secret is extracted from a single site, it can compromise connections to all other sites, regardless of their long-term SSL certificates.

We found many "service groups" where multiple domains shared a session cache, STEK, or Diffie-Hellman value, making these secrets valuable targets for attacks. This behavior is likely due to domains sharing an SSL terminator, such as a Cavium card or multiple domains running on the same web server.

#### Shared Session ID Caches

To establish a lower bound on how many websites share session ID caches, we conducted a cross-domain probing experiment. We attempted to resume a TLS connection to domain B using a session that originated from domain A. We limited the experiment to a small number of domains from each AS and transitively grew the graph.

For each site, we randomly selected up to five other sites in its AS and up to five sites that shared its IP address and tested whether its session ID allowed connection to these other sites. Of the 357,536 domains that supported session ID resumption, we found 212,491 service groups, of which 183,261 (86%) contained only a single domain. The largest service group belonged to CloudFlare, containing 30,163 domains (66% of the 45,520 Alexa Top Million domains in their AS). Table 5 lists the ten largest session cache service groups.

#### Shared STEKs

To track how STEKs are shared across servers, we connected to each April 17, 2016 Alexa Top Million domain ten times over a six-hour window and grouped sites that shared at least one STEK identifier during the scans. We repeated the experiment with one connection over a 30-minute window and joined the two groups.

Of the 354,697 sites that supported session tickets, we found 170,634 STEK service groups, of which 140,715 (83%) contained only a single domain. The largest group belonged to CloudFlare, containing 62,176 domains, followed by Alphabet (Google's parent company) with 8,973 hosts sharing a STEK. Table 6 lists the top ten largest STEK service groups.

#### Shared (EC)DHE Values

Lastly, we looked for Alexa Top Million domains that shared DHE or ECDHE key-exchange values. We completed 10 TLS handshakes with each Alexa Top Million domain over a five-hour window and performed a scan that made a single connection to every domain during a 30-minute window. Both scans were conducted twice, once with only DHE ciphers and once with only ECDHE ciphers.

We found that Diffie-Hellman values were shared in fewer instances and by smaller groups than session caches or STEKs. The most widely shared DHE value was seen 1,368 times across 137 domains and 119 IP addresses, all within AS 20401 (Hostway Corporation). We also found a single ECDHE value shared 1,790 times across 179 domains on a single IP, which appeared to be a Jimdo hosting server on Amazon EC2.

We labeled servers that presented the same DHE or ECDHE key-exchange value as part of the same service group. We found 421,492 Diffie-Hellman service groups, of which 417,397 (99%) contained only a single domain. The largest group belonged to SquareSpace and contained 1,627 domains. Table 7 identifies the largest ephemeral value service groups.

### Crypto Shortcut Dangers

As of May 2016, 90.2% of Top Million domains with trusted HTTPS use forward-secret key exchanges for connections from modern browsers. However, the interaction of crypto shortcuts and cross-domain secret sharing reveals that many popular domains remain susceptible to retrospective decryption.

Forward secrecy is not a binary concept but a gradient where the confidentiality of the data is forward-secret after a passage of time dependent on various factors. At one extreme, a complex key-ratcheting mechanism can protect data confidentiality even if an endpoint is compromised during the connection. At the other extreme, a TLS connection using RSA key exchange is effectively never forward-secure due to the long-term nature of SSL certificates and their storage on disk.

To quantify forward secrecy, we can establish lower bounds for each site's vulnerability window, the span of time during which an attacker could recover the session keys for an observed TLS connection by compromising secret values stored by the server. Our measurements provide estimates, but the true exposure may be greater. While we can detect that a server refuses to resume older sessions, we cannot tell whether it has securely erased the corresponding secrets or whether they may be vulnerable to forensic recovery.

In addition to quantifying forward secrecy, we must account for the concentration of secrets. In a secure world, a compromise of one server would affect as few connections on as few domains as possible. However, as shown in Section 5, the compromise of a small number of SSL endpoints could endanger a large number of domains' content, presenting an enticing target for attackers.

### Exposure from Session Tickets

The long-term usage of session ticket encryption keys (STEKs) is the most concerning practice. Since the session ticket contains the session keys encrypted with the STEK and is sent outside the TLS tunnel, an attacker who obtains the associated STEK can decrypt the ticket, recover the session keys, and decrypt the connection contents.
