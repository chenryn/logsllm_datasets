### Title: BotConf 2017 - Automation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) Botnet Takedowns by an ISP

Over the past 12 months, IoT botnets have frequently made headlines. Beyond the media hype, these botnets pose a significant threat that can be mitigated through targeted actions to discourage their operators, who are often inexperienced individuals, or "kiddies." These operators frequently purchase services from third parties to set up Command & Control (C&C) servers, which can significantly amplify the potential for harm.

The increasing number of IoT botnets has prompted us to develop a workflow to address this growing threat. This presentation will demonstrate how to identify the C&C servers of IoT botnets and detail how OVH implemented an automated workflow to detect and neutralize them within its network. This workflow, currently in production, successfully extracts the C&C IP addresses in 9 out of 10 cases and can be easily adopted by other Internet Service Providers (ISPs).

OVH is one of the world's leading hosting companies, offering a range of services including bare metal servers, cloud instances, web hosting, and xDSL links. Known for mitigating a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack exceeding the terabit-per-second threshold, initiated by a MIRAI botnet, OVH is committed to combating the proliferation of botnets.
