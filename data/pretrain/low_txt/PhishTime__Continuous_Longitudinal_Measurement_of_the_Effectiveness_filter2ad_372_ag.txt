By replicating phishing attacks in a controlled environment, we were able to identify and address the vulnerabilities that attackers exploit in existing defenses. Our highly automated approach provides the flexibility to deploy experiments that not only realistically replicate current attacks but can also be used to proactively test emerging threats or new mitigations.

Anti-phishing defenses, including browser blacklists, are sophisticated systems. Despite their ability to quickly respond to a record volume of phishing attacks, even a minor failure in one system component, such as a crawler or reporting channel, can allow certain attacks to succeed and harm users. Our empirical measurement approach helps pinpoint such failures when they affect overall mitigation performance.

Beyond making ecosystem-level recommendations, our approach benefits organizations frequently impersonated by phishers. Experiments focusing on a specific brand can measure how effectively the ecosystem protects that brand’s customers and how well the brand implements its own anti-phishing measures, which may otherwise be difficult to assess.

Given the evolving nature of both phishing attacks and corresponding defenses, longitudinal measurements of the ecosystem are essential. These measurements not only help maintain an understanding of the ecosystem's protection but also evaluate new security features as they are released, ensuring continuous user security.
