### Issue Description
Over the past few weeks, I have been unable to access a specific website. Although I can view the offline Cloudflare version of the homepage, I consistently receive the following error messages: "522 Connection Timed Out" and "Host Error." This issue is unique to this site, as I do not encounter similar problems with other websites. 

Interestingly, the site works on my phone when it is not connected to my home Wi-Fi. However, when I connect to my home Wi-Fi, I receive a "Host Error." Could someone please provide guidance on how to resolve this issue? This is my second attempt at reporting this problem.
