## Abstract

The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to seamlessly connect everything and everyone, enabling smart environments, Industry 4.0, intelligent infrastructure management, environmental monitoring, disaster recovery, and more. According to ABI Research [1] and Gartner [2], the number of IoT devices is projected to reach between 20 and 30 billion by 2020. This rapid growth in interconnected devices presents significant challenges in ensuring their security, network security, and the privacy of the data they collect.

The Workshop on Trustworthy Embedded Devices (TrustED) focuses on all aspects of security and privacy related to embedded systems and the IoT. TrustED 2014 continues a successful series of workshops, previously held in conjunction with ESORICS 2011, IEEE Security & Privacy 2012, and ACM CCS 2013 (see http://www.trusted-workshop.de for details). The goal of this workshop is to bring together experts from academia, research institutes, industry, and government to discuss and address the challenges and recent developments in the field of security and privacy in cyber-physical systems.

## 1. Background and Motivation

The paradigm of ubiquitous computing and permanent, mobile connectivity has become a reality through modern technologies that allow electronic systems to be embedded almost everywhere, most prominently in smartphones. It is predicted [1, 2] that the number of Internet-connected devices will increase exponentially, reaching over 20 billion by 2020. Examples of such interconnected systems include sensor nodes, smart meters, femtocells, automotive platforms, home gateways, smart homes, and IPTV boxes, among others.

Unfortunately, the new opportunities created by smart environments and infrastructures also come with new security and privacy risks, particularly when embedded systems are involved. These systems, which we interact with daily, often unknowingly, differ significantly from traditional systems like desktop PCs in several ways:

- **Constrained Resources:** They have limited power, memory, and computational capabilities, necessitating the redesign of standard security solutions.
- **Ease of Accessibility:** Malicious parties can easily access, replace, or physically tamper with these devices.
- **Connectivity:** Most (future) embedded devices will be network-enabled and connected to more powerful devices or gateways, making them prime targets for network attacks.

The challenge is to develop security solutions that ensure trust, security, and privacy while meeting the constraints of embedded systems. Additionally, guaranteeing security across different layers of the embedded system (hardware, OS, and application) while minimizing overhead is both a challenge and a requirement for successful system deployment.

## 2. Scope and Objectives

In summary, security for embedded systems is a highly interdisciplinary topic, presenting both new challenges and new possibilities. A promising approach is to exploit special features in embedded devices and their environment to establish novel security and privacy mechanisms. Examples include:

- Identification and deployment of new out-of-band channels, such as NFC-based schemes.
- Explicit use of physical properties, such as distance bounding protocols, signal fingerprinting, and information-theoretic secret key derivation from wireless fading channels.
- Secure execution environments provided by new generations of processors.
- Use of hardware-entangled cryptography (e.g., schemes based on physically unclonable functions) and hardware-assisted cryptographic protocols.

In this workshop, we will consider selected aspects of cyber-physical systems and their environments. We aim to bring together experts from academia, industry, and government organizations to discuss and investigate the problems, challenges, and recent scientific and technological developments in this field. The workshop topics include (but are not limited to):

- Embedded system security
- Privacy aspects of embedded systems (e.g., medical devices, electronic IDs)
- Physical and logical convergence (e.g., secure and privacy-preserving facility management)
- Hardware-entangled cryptography
- Foundation, development, and applications of physical security primitives (e.g., physically unclonable functions - PUFs)
- Remote attestation
- IP protection for embedded systems
- Reverse engineering
- Secure execution environments (e.g., TrustZone, TPMs) on mobile devices
- New protection paradigms for trustworthy embedded systems
