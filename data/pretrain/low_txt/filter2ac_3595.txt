**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Privileged Account Management

Regularly audit domain and local accounts, along with their permission levels, to identify any situations that could enable an adversary to gain system-wide access using stolen privileged account credentials. [11] [12] These audits should also check for the presence of enabled default accounts and unauthorized new local accounts. 

To mitigate risks, follow best practices for the design and administration of an enterprise network, particularly focusing on limiting the use of privileged accounts across different administrative tiers. [13]
