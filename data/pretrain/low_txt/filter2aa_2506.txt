## Introduction to MoCA (Media over Coaxial Alliance)
- **Formation**: A collaboration of media companies.
- **Objective**: Utilize existing coaxial cabling for content delivery.
  - **Advantages**:
    - Shielded
    - High frequency bandwidth
    - Signal transmission up to 500 feet
- **Specifications**:
  - **PHY/MAC**: Defines the physical and media access control layers.
  - **Network Creation**: Establishes a network on the coaxial bus.
  - **Bandwidth Guarantees**: Ensures specific bandwidths at certain distances.

### MoCA Operation
- **PHY (Physical Layer)**:
  - **Medium**: Coaxial cable.
  - **Frequencies & Signaling**:
    - Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM).
    - WAN and LAN channel sets.
- **MAC (Media Access Control)**:
  - **Control Mechanisms**:
    - Scheduled frames.
    - Master node controller.
    - Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA).
    - Assured speeds.

### PHY and MAC Rates
| PHY Rate (Mbps) | Minimum MAC Rate (Mbps) |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| ≥275            | 139.87                  |
| 250             | 130.78                  |
| 225             | 119.45                  |
| 200             | 107.74                  |
| 175             | 95.64                   |
| 150             | 81.98                   |
| 125             | 68.32                   |
| 100             | 54.65                   |
| 75              | 39.82                   |

### MoCA Features and Prevalence
- **Triple Play Enablement**: Supports voice, video, and data services.
- **ISP Preference**: Desirable for high-definition television (HDTV) and guaranteed speeds.
- **Widespread Deployment**:
  - Common in North American and European broadband installations.
  - Examples: FIOS, Cable/Xfinity, Dish/Satellite, DVR, Set-Top Box (STB).

### The Wall Wart and Optical Network Terminator (ONT)
- **Optical Cable**: Runs from the neighborhood splitter to the home.
- **ONT**: Installed on the exterior of the home.
  - **Function**: Bridges fiber to coaxial or CAT5 cable.
  - **ISP Preference**: Coaxial for MoCA.

### MoCA Inside the Home
- **Actiontec Router**:
  - SPI firewall.
  - NAT router.
  - 2 MoCA nodes (NC).
  - MoCA-to-Ethernet bridge.
- **Digital Video Recorder (DVR)**:
  - Onboard MoCA networking.
  - Dependent on Actiontec router for time synchronization and TV channel data.

### Potential Security Vulnerabilities
- **External Access Point**: Utility point-of-presence with ONT and root coax splitter.
- **Attack Vectors**:
  - **No Keys Required**: Attacker can connect directly.
  - **Tools**:
    - MoCA-to-Ethernet bridge.
    - RG-6 Coaxial Cable.
    - >1GHz Coaxial Splitter.
- **Exploitation**:
  - **Burning Bridges**: Connect attack device to the bridge’s Ethernet interface.
  - **Lack of Link Protection**: Any device can connect to the Actiontec LAN.

### Consequences of Exploitation
- **Network Extension**: Internal Ethernet LAN extended outside the home.
- **Potential Attacks**:
  - Firewall bypass.
  - Network redirection (ARP poisoning, DHCP spoofing, DNS hijacking).
  - Traffic profiling (deep packet inspection).
  - Direct attacks on the local Ethernet network using tools like Ettercap, dnsniff, Metasploit, BeEF, EvilGrade, Karmetasploit.

### Mitigation and Defense
- **MoCA Filters**:
  - Block signals in MoCA ranges.
  - Marketed as a security layer to prevent unwanted MoCA signals.
  - Typically located on the feed to the splitter.
  - Designed to prevent signal bleed between houses, not between interior and exterior walls.

### Building a Disposable Attack Unit
- **Requirements**:
  - Physical toolkit for insertion, power, and computing.
  - Remote access via reverse tunnel.
  - Traffic redirection and content manipulation.
- **Design Objectives**:
  - Do no harm (educational purposes only).
  - Use standard, updatable, and disposable tools.
  - Minimize power consumption.
  - Control costs.

### Components
- **Power Supply**:
  - APC BackUPS 350 ES.
  - Management software for soft shutdown.
  - ~60 hours uptime for a 3VA device.
- **Raspberry Pi**:
  - Model B – 512 MB RAM.
  - ARM11 processor.
  - Minimal power consumption.
  - 8GB class 10 SD Card for storage.
- **Software**:
  - Kali Linux (penetration testing distribution).
  - Universal Plug-n-Play (uPNP) protocol.
  - MoCA-to-Ethernet bridge (Netgear MCAB1001).

### uPNP and IGD
- **uPNP**:
  - Service discovery on broadcast domains (UDP port 1900).
  - No authentication required.
- **Internet Gateway Device (IGD)**:
  - Adjusts firewall rules based on internal host requests.
  - No authentication.
  - Forwards requested ports and sets up NAT.
  - Supported by Microsoft, DLNA, ISPs.

### Image Manipulation
- **Transparent Proxy**:
  - Squid for URL rewriting.
  - ImageMagick libraries for image manipulation.
- **I Love My Neighbors**:
  - Josh Wright’s wireless honeypot distribution.
  - Perl scripts for URL rewriting.

### Recipe for Raspberry MoCA
- **Phase 1**:
  - Insertion and remote access.
  - Execute uPNP command to forward an external port to the local SSH server.
- **Phase 2**:
  - ARP poison the LAN.
  - Redirect web streams to a local proxy.
  - Manipulate the web stream.

### Results and Performance
- **ARM11 Performance**:
  - Single core, slow for large images.
  - Reduced Apache and Squid to 5 threads.
  - Simple flips, animated GIFs are slow.
- **Traffic Redirection**:
  - Successful redirection with minimal performance issues.
  - Effective for simple text replacements.

### Security Needs
- **Exposure**: Major exposure of the physical transport layer.
- **Reassessment**: Requires attention from cable installers and Internet providers.
- **Consumer Awareness**: Consumers should demand better security.

### Ongoing Work
- **Detection and Alerts**:
  - Detect MoCA injections.
  - Alert on network insertion.
- **Collaborative Projects**:
  - SLIM and Counter-Pi (in collaboration with Stephan Browarny).
