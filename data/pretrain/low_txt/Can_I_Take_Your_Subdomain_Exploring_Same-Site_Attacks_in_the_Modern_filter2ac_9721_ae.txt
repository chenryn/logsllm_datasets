# Analysis of Web Security Vulnerabilities to Related-Domain Attacks

## Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the security threats posed by related-domain attackers on web applications. We introduce a novel framework that captures the capabilities acquired by such attackers and discuss the advantages they have over traditional web attackers. We also examine the security implications of 31 third-party service providers and dynamic DNS services, identifying the vulnerabilities that arise when an attacker takes over a domain hosted by these services. Additionally, we present a new subdomain hijacking technique and describe the design of our automated toolchain used to assess the pervasiveness of these threats in the wild. Our large-scale analysis of the 50,000 most popular domains identified vulnerabilities in 887 of them, including major websites like cnn.com and cisco.com.

## Notation for Service Vulnerability
- **Service not affected (¸)**
- **Service is vulnerable (V)**
- **Conditions of redirect and PSL do not apply (−)**
- **Could not evaluate (e.g., due to payment required, no public registration form, etc.) (?)**

### Example Services and Their Status
- **Helpscout**: Allows hosting only arbitrary active content files (JS, CSS)
- **Gemfury**: Allows hosting only arbitrary passive content files (images, media, etc.)
- **Launchrock**: Implicitly associates every subdomain to the mapped domain, not just the `www` subdomain.

## Table: Public Suffix List (PSL) on Dynamic DNS Services
| Service       | # Domains | PSL                 |
|---------------|-----------|---------------------|
| afraid (FreeDNS) | 52,443    | V 0/52,443          |
| duckdns       | 1         | ¸ 1/1               |
| dyndns        | 293       | V 287/293           |
| noip          | 91        | V 85/91             |
| securepoint   | 10        | ¸ 10/10             |

### Key Findings
- **Cookie Integrity**: Many domains are vulnerable to session fixation and cookie forcing due to the lack of integrity against related-domain attackers. The adoption of the `__Host-` prefix can improve cookie integrity, but its usage is currently negligible.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Incorrect configurations in CSPs make them ineffective even against web attackers. Related-domain attackers can bypass CSP protections on 139 additional domains, particularly for object injection, frame injection, and framing control.
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: Related-domain attackers can exploit CORS deployments more effectively than traditional web attackers, with 224 new exploitable cases, including 63 with credentials.
- **Domain Relaxation**: 57 out of 97 domains using domain relaxation are vulnerable to related-domain attacks, which can bypass all web security boundaries.
- **postMessage**: Sites either do not enforce any security checks or restrict communication to selected origins, making related-domain attackers no more powerful than web attackers for this attack vector.

## Related Work
- **Related-Domain Attackers**: First introduced by Bortz, Barth, and Czeskis, who proposed origin cookies as a defense mechanism. The `__Host-` prefix was later integrated into major web browsers.
- **Subdomain Takeover**: Studies by Liu et al. and Borgolte et al. have examined the threat posed by dangling DNS records and deprovisioned cloud instances, respectively.
- **Web Measurements**: Various studies have analyzed cross-origin data exchange, CORS misconfigurations, and postMessage handlers, but none have specifically considered related-domain attacks.

## Conclusion
This paper provides the first detailed analysis of the threats posed by related-domain attackers to web application security. We introduced a framework to capture the capabilities of these attackers and presented a new subdomain hijacking technique. Our large-scale analysis revealed significant vulnerabilities in many popular domains, highlighting the need for better security practices and the adoption of robust defenses like the `__Host-` prefix.
