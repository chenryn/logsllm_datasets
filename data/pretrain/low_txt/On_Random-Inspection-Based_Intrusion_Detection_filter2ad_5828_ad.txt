# Performance Overhead of WindRain at Different Inspection Frequencies

## Introduction
The following data and analysis focus on the performance overhead of WindRain, an intrusion detection system, at varying inspection frequencies. The inspection frequency is defined as the number of instructions executed between inspections.

### Data
- **Inspection Frequency (in number of instructions):** 1800, 1400, 1600, 2000, 2400
- **Performance Overhead (in %):** 1200, 1000, 2200, 1800, 1400, 1600, 2000, 2400

### Figure 1: Performance Overhead vs. Inspection Frequency
- **Y-axis:** Overhead in %
- **X-axis:** Inspection frequency in number of instructions executed before an inspection occurs

## Analysis
From the results in Figure 1, it is evident that the performance overhead decreases significantly as the inspection frequency decreases. This highlights a trade-off between the detection rate and the performance overhead. 

### Trade-offs and Implications
- **Detection Rate vs. Overhead:** A higher inspection frequency improves the detection rate but increases the performance overhead.
- **Obfuscation Techniques:** Techniques that lengthen the Virtual Verification Path (VVP) of injected code can help. For instance, if an obfuscation technique ensures that any injected code will spend at least 2000 instructions locating the necessary library functions, we can perform inspections every 2000 instructions with an overhead of around 20%.

### Comparison with System-Call-Based IDS
- **System-Call-Based IDS:** Typically incur more than 100% overhead in interposing system calls unless the kernel is modified.
- **WindRain's Performance:** Even with random inspections every 800 instructions, WindRain's overhead is significantly lower.

### Contribution of Random Inspection to Overhead
To isolate the overhead contributed by the random-inspection process, we compared WindRain with a system that performs random inspections without PC-value checking. The results show:
- **Overhead Contribution:** More than 89% of the overhead comes from performing random inspections.
- **PC Value Checking:** Only slightly increases the overhead, indicating the feasibility of more sophisticated checks at each inspection point.

### Pipeline Flushing and Overhead
- **Pipeline Flushing:** Identified as a major cause of overhead in both WindRain and system-call-based systems.
- **Cache Misses and Paging:** No significant increase in cache miss rate or paging rate during random inspections.

## Conclusions and Future Work
### Summary
- **System-Call-Based Anomaly Detection Systems:** Vulnerable to mimicry attacks and non-portable for Windows.
- **Random Inspection:** Provides a complementary mechanism that is less susceptible to mimicry attacks and can be implemented on Windows without kernel modification.

### Future Enhancements
- **Dynamic Code Handling:** Solutions for dynamically-generated/self-modifying code.
- **Selective Activation:** Turning off WindRain for non-critical processes to reduce overhead.
- **Profile-Based Intrusion Detection:** Utilizing information available at random-inspection points to design profile-based systems.
- **Address Obfuscation:** Making attacks more complicated and detectable by random-inspection-based systems.
