> "Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat."
> - Sun Tzu

These two concepts are more closely related than we often realize.

### Joint Operations Planning Process
- **Effects-Based Planning**
  - COG (Center of Gravity): The source of power that provides moral or physical strength, freedom of action, or will to act.
  - CCs (Critical Capabilities): Crucial enablers for a COG to function.
  - CRs (Critical Requirements): Conditions, resources, and means that enable a critical capability to become fully operational.
  - CVs (Critical Vulnerabilities): Aspects or components of CRs that are deficient or vulnerable to direct or indirect attack.

- **Tasks, Effects, Objectives, and End State (E/S)**
  - (Military) End State: A point in time and/or circumstances beyond which the President does not require the military instrument of national power as the primary means to achieve remaining national objectives.
  - Objectives: Clearly defined, decisive, and attainable goals.
  - Effects: Physical and/or behavioral state of a system resulting from an action, set of actions, or another effect.
  - Tasks: Direct friendly action.

### Planning Phases
- **Planning Initiation**
- **Mission Analysis**
- **Course of Action (COA) Development**
- **COA Wargaming and Comparison**
- **COA Selection and Approval**

### Mission Analysis
- Determine known facts
- Analyze the higher commander’s intent
- Determine specified, implied, and essential tasks
- Determine operational limitations
- Develop assumptions
- Determine own and enemy’s center of gravity
- Determine initial commanders' CCIRs
- Conduct initial force structure
- Conduct initial risk assessment
- Develop mission statement
- Develop mission analysis brief
- Prepare initial staff estimates

### Mission to Task
- **United States Government**
  - **CCs**: Banking, Law Enforcement, First Responders
  - **CRs**: Banks, Telecom, Police, Utilities, Transportation
  - **CVs**: Physical, Technical, Procedural

- **Tasks, Effects, Objectives, and End State (E/S)**
  - Destabilize United States Critical Infrastructure
  - Disrupt, Degrade, Destroy
  - Varied by Target
  - Kinetic, Non-Kinetic

### COA Development

- Feasible
- Acceptable
- Distinguishable
- Complete
  - Objective, effects, and tasks
  - Major forces required
  - Concepts for deployment, employment, and sustainment
