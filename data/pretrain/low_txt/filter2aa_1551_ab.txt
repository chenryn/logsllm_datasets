# Permanent IP Address and Security Aspects

## Overview
- **Permanent IP Address**
- **Security Aspects**

## HI3 Delivery
- **The Dutch TIIT Specifications**
  - **TIIT (Technical Interface for Intercepted Traffic)**
  - **WGLI (Wireless Gateway Lawful Interception)**
  - **The Players**
  - **The End Result V.1.0**

## Deadlines
- **Full IP & Email**: 2002
- **NLIP (National Lawful Interception Platform)**

## Costs and Challenges
- **ISP Challenge**
- **Costs**

## User (LEA) Requirements for Transport
- **Description of Handover Interface (HI)**
  - **HI1**: Method depends on LEA, but also contains crypto keys.
  - **HI2**: Events like login, logout, access e-mailbox, etc.
  - **HI3**: Content of Communication and additional generated information (hash results and NULL packets).

## General Architecture for HI2 and HI3
- **Handover Interface Specification**
  - **Global Data Structures**
    - **S1: T2 Traffic Definition**
    - **Data Structures and Message Flows for HI2 and HI3**
    - **Use of Cryptography**

### Detailed Architecture
- **S1: Interception**
  - Intercept target traffic
  - Time stamp target packets
  - Generate SHA hash over 64 target packets
  - Encrypt with key specific for this interception
  - Send to S2
- **S2: Gathering & Transport**
  - Collect target packets from authenticated S1s
  - Distribute target packets randomly over the T1s over a TLS or IPsec channel
  - Use X.509 certificates for mutual authentication
- **S3: Management Box**
  - Not part of TIIT
  - Management system for starting & stopping interceptions
  - Collect billing data
  - Etc.

### T2 and T1 Functions
- **T2: Decrypt packets from S1s, check integrity**
- **T1: End TLS or IPsec channels, forward data to T2(s) of the LEA that ordered the interception**

## Interception Suppliers and Techniques
- **LI Implementations**
  - **Verint (formerly Comverse Infosys)**
    - Based in Israel
    - Used by Dutch LEMF
    - Supports CALEA & ETSI
    - Use of Top Layer switch
  - **NICE**
    - Used in BE as t1
    - Proprietary, implemented for ETSI
    - Features: topic extraction, keyword spotting, remote send of CC, auto language detection and translation
    - Runs on Windows NT & 2000 Svr
    - Standalone internet/telephony solution
  - **ADC (formerly SS8)**
    - Use of proprietary hardware
    - Used for large bandwidth circuits
    - Known to be used in satellite traffic centers
    - Supports CALEA & ETSI
    - Use of Top Layer switch
  - **Accuris**
    - Max. of 50 concurrent taps
    - Solution not dependent on switch type
    - Can use single S2 as concentrator
    - Offers Gigabit Solution
    - Supports CALEA & ETSI

## Cost Considerations
- **Solutions can cost anywhere from 100,000 Euro to 700,000 Euro for the ISP**
- **UK Govt. expected to spend 46 billion over the next 5 years, subsequently reduced to 27 billion**
- **Division of costs**
  - **Cap Ex = ISP**
  - **Op Ex = Govt.**
- **Penalties for non-compliance**
  - Fines up to 250,000 euros
  - Civil charges
  - House arrest of CEO of ISP

## Conclusions for Law Enforcement
- **If you're going to do it, do it right**
- **Disclosure of tools and methods**
- **Adherence to warrant submission requirements**
- **Completeness of logs and supporting info.**
- **Proof of non-contamination of target data**
- **Maintaining relationship with the private sector**
- **Training**
- **Defining role of police investigators and civilian technicians**
- **Handling multi-focal investigations**

## Future Developments & Issues
- **EU Expansion and Europol stipulations**
- **Data Retention Decisions**
- **ENFOPOL organization**
- **Borderless LI**
- **ISP Role**
- **EU wide agreements on Intercept Initiation**
- **Quantum Cryptography**
- **WLAN challenges**
- **The Future of Privacy Legislation?**

## Q&A / Discussion
- **Does LI deliver added value to Law Enforcement's ability to protect the public?**
- **What about open source interception tools?**
- **Will there be a return of the Clipper Chip?**
- **Should there be mandated Key Escrow of ISP's encryption keys?**
- **What types of oversight need to be built into the system to prevent abuse?**

Thank You.
