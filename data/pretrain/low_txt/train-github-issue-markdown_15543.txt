When I downloaded Bootstrap 3 from the customization page, I encountered an issue with the font files being corrupt, which prevented Glyphicons from functioning properly. However, after downloading Bootstrap from the main homepage at [http://getbootstrap.com/](http://getbootstrap.com/), the problem was resolved.
