## Abstract
Mobile devices, such as smartphones and internet-capable tablets, now possess computing and networking capabilities comparable to traditional personal computers. While their widespread adoption has brought numerous benefits, it has also introduced significant security and privacy concerns. The operating systems of these devices, including iOS and Android, offer both advantages and disadvantages in terms of security. On one hand, they use application sandboxing to contain exploits and limit the privileges of malware. On the other hand, they collect and organize a variety of security- and privacy-sensitive information, making it easily accessible to third-party applications.

Recognizing smartphone security and privacy as an emerging area, this workshop aims to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners to exchange ideas and deepen our understanding of various security and privacy issues on smartphones. The workshop solicits technical and position papers on a wide range of relevant topics, with a particular emphasis on novel paradigms and controversial ideas. With strong community engagement, the workshop is expected to be a vibrant forum for creative debate and interaction in security- and privacy-sensitive areas of computing and communication impacted by smartphones and mobile devices.

## 1. Introduction
In recent years, the adoption of smartphones and mobile devices has seen a meteoric rise. In 2011, for the first time in history, smartphones outsold personal computers. This popularity can be attributed to the incredible functionality and convenience these devices offer, transforming them from basic communication tools into powerful platforms for web surfing, social networking, GPS navigation, and online banking. The latest generation of mobile devices now boasts computing and networking capabilities comparable to traditional personal computers.

While mainstream mobile platforms like Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android provide impressive features and a vast array of applications, their success has also introduced significant security and privacy challenges. For example, the widespread presence of information-stealing apps and other types of malicious software raises substantial concerns. Centralized marketplaces or app stores streamline the process of app browsing, downloads, and installation, but they can also facilitate the rapid spread of mobile malware.

The operating systems supporting these devices have both strengths and weaknesses. They use application sandboxing to contain exploits and limit the privileges of malware. However, they also collect and organize a variety of security- and privacy-sensitive information, making it easily accessible to third-party applications.

## 2. Workshop Goals
Recognizing smartphone security and privacy as an active research area, this workshop aims to provide a vibrant platform for researchers and practitioners to exchange ideas and deepen our understanding of various security and privacy issues on smartphones and mobile devices. The workshop should appeal to both academic researchers and industry practitioners in the privacy and security communities, providing a forum to present novel issues and techniques related to smartphones and mobile devices.

The workshop will address different aspects of accessing, transporting, and processing personal or sensitive information stored in mobile devices. It will also explore how to effectively balance privacy (or security) and usability, improving one without necessarily undermining the other. The workshop serves as a forum for the confluence of new and multidisciplinary ideas, driving research in privacy and security, embedded systems, human-computer interaction, and mobile computing.

Affiliated with the ACM CCS main conference, this workshop was successfully held last year, with 19 submissions, 9 accepted papers, and over 80 registered attendees. Building on this success, we aim to continue actively soliciting participation from researchers and practitioners in academia, industry, and government agencies, expecting even more submissions and attendees.

## 3. Topics of Interest
All researchers and practitioners are encouraged to submit papers covering various security and privacy issues on smartphones and mobile devices, particularly on platforms like iOS and Android. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Device/hardware security
- OS/middleware security
- Application security
- Marketplace security
- Authenticating users to devices and services
- Mobile web browsers
- Usability
- Privacy
- Rogue application detection and recovery
- Vulnerability detection and remediation
- Secure application development
- Mobile virtualization
- Mobile payment
- In-app advertisement security
- Program analysis for mobile applications
- Cloud support for mobile security

We especially encourage novel paradigms and controversial ideas that may not be listed above. The workshop aims to be a venue for creative debate and interaction in security- and privacy-sensitive areas of computing and communication impacted by smartphones.

## 4. Workshop Organization
The workshop will take place over a full day and will consist of a keynote presentation and a series of research papers reporting the latest advances in smartphone security and privacy. The keynote speech will be given by Geir Olsen, Principal Program Manager in the Windows Phone team, who will discuss "Windows Phone 8 Security."

We welcome both full papers presenting relatively complete and mature research results and short position papers reporting work-in-progress with inspiring and intriguing new ideas. The tentative program is as follows:

| Time        | Activity                    |
|-------------|-----------------------------|
| 8:30 - 8:40 | Opening Remarks             |
| 8:40 - 9:40 | Keynote                     |
| 9:40 - 10:00| Morning Break               |
| 10:00 - 12:00| Technical Session I         |
| 12:00 - 1:30| Lunch                       |
| 1:30 - 3:00 | Technical Session II        |
| 3:00 - 3:45 | Afternoon Break             |
| 3:45 - 5:45 | Technical Session III       |
| 5:45 - 5:50 | Closing Remarks             |

Each technical session will feature 15-minute back-to-back talks followed by 45 minutes of discussion. The goal is to engage the audience and presenters in discussions that reveal potential challenges and generate new insights for improvements or solutions.
