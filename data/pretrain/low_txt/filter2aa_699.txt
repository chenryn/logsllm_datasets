## Overview
### Introduction/Background
- **Getting Up to Speed: Badge Basics**
  - **Name**: Frequency, Distance
    - **Low Frequency (LF)**: 120kHz – 140kHz, <3ft (commonly under 1.5ft)
    - **High Frequency (HF)**: 13.56MHz, 3-10 ft
    - **Ultra-High-Frequency (UHF)**: 860-960MHz (regional), ~30ft
  - **Legacy 125kHz**
    - According to Stephane Ardiley of HID Global, "Legacy 125-kilohertz proximity technology is still in place at around 70% to 80% of all physical access control deployments in the U.S., and it will be a long time."
    - "There is no security, they’ve been hacked, there’s no protection of data, no privacy, everything is in the clear and it’s not resistant to sniffing or common attacks."

### Points of Attack
- **Card**: Broadcasts 26-37 bit card number
- **Reader**: Converts card data to Wiegand Protocol for transmission to the controller; no access decisions are made by the reader
- **Controller**: Decodes binary card data and makes the decision to grant access
- **Host PC**: Manages card holders, access privileges, and monitors system events in real time

### Badge Types
- **Data on Access Cards**: A string of binary numbers (ones and zeros) of a fixed configuration and length, used to identify the cardholder.
- **HID Card Types**:
  - Magnetic Stripe
  - Wiegand (swipe)
  - 125 kHz Prox (HID & Indala)
  - MIFARE contactless smart cards
  - iCLASS contactless smart cards
  - Multi-technology cards

### Card Elements
- **Card ID Number**
- **Facility Code**
- **Site Code (occasionally)**
- **Note**: If a printed card number is visible, it may be possible to brute force the 1-255 facility code for a Standard 26-bit card.

### RFID Hacking Tools
- **Proxmark3**: An RFID hacking Swiss army knife that can read, simulate, and clone RFID cards. Cost: $399
- **ProxBrute**: Custom firmware for the Proxmark3 to brute-force higher privileged badges.
- **RFIDiot Scripts**: Various tools for RFID hacking.
- **RFIDeas Tools**: No software required, identifies card type and data, useful for badges without visual indicators of card type. Cost: $269.00

### Tastic RFID Thief
- **Features**:
  - Can be hidden in a briefcase or messenger bag, reads badges from up to 3 feet away.
  - Silent powering and stealing of RFID badge credentials to be cloned later using T55x7 cards.
- **Design**:
  - Designed using Fritzing and exported to Extended-Gerber.
  - PCB can be ordered at [www.4pcb.com](http://www.4pcb.com).
  - Cost: $33 for 1 PCB, much cheaper in bulk.

### Custom PCB
- **Tastic RFID Thief**: Easy to plug into any type of RFID badge reader.
- **Wiegand Input**: Reads from the Wiegand output of the reader.

### Commercial Readers
- **Indala Long-Range Reader 620**
- **HID MaxiProx 5375AGN00**

### Forward Channel Attacks
- **Eavesdropping RFID**: Tools like Cloner 2.0 by Chris Paget can reach up to 10 feet, though it was never publicly released.

### Programmable Cards
- **T55x7 Cards**: Simulate data and behavior of any badge type.
- **Q5 Cards (T5555)**: Example of cloning to T55x7 Card using Proxmark3.

### Reader and Controller Attacks
- **Direct Approach**: Dump private keys, valid badge info, and more in a few seconds.
- **MITM Attack**: Insert a device in the door reader to record badge numbers.

### Backdoors and Other Fun
- **Pwn Plug**: A small, portable device for maintaining access.
  - **Pwn Plug Elite**: $995.00
  - **Power Pwn**: $1,495.00
- **Raspberry Pi**: A cheap alternative (~$35) to Pwn Plug/Power Pwn.
  - **Pwnie Express**: Raspberry Pwn
  - **Rogue Pi**: RPi Pentesting Dropbox
  - **Pwn Pi v3.0**

### Little Extra Touches
- **Fake Polo Shirts**: Get the logo from the target website.
- **Fargo DTC515 Full Color ID Card ID Badge Printer**: ~$500 on Amazon.
- **Badge Accessories**
- **HD PenCam**: Mini 720p Video Camera
- **Lock Pick Gun/Set**

### Defenses
- **Implement Secure Active RFID Systems**: Use encryption, mutual authentication, and message replay protection.
- **2-Factor Authentication**: Incorporate elements such as a PIN pad or biometric inputs.
- **Physical Security**: Implement intrusion and anomaly detection software.
- **Employee Training**: Instruct employees not to wear badges prominently outside company premises.
- **RFID Card Shields**: Prevent drive-by card sniffing attacks.
- **Secure Badge Readers**: Use security screws and tamper-detect mechanisms. Monitor readers and doors with CCTV.

### Resources
- **RFID Security by Syngress**: Last updated July 2005.
- **NIST SP 800-98 – Securing RFID**: Last updated April 2007.
- **Hackin9 Magazine – Aug 2011**: RFID Hacking, pretty decent.

### Example of Broken Defense
- **USA - Green Card Sleeve**: Since May 11, 2010, new Green Cards contain an RFID chip. Carl’s “protective sleeve” does not block anything, providing a false sense of security.
