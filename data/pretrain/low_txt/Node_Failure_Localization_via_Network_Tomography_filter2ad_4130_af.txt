# Upper Bound (Ω=σ) Analysis

## Figure 7: Bounds on the Maximum Identifiability
### Densely-Connected Random Topologies
- **Parameters**: |V| = 20, µ = 2, ..., 10, E[|L|] = 99, 50 graph instances per model.
- **Models**:
  - RG (Random Graph)
  - BA (Barabási–Albert Model)
  - RPL (Random Power-Law)

### Observations
- The maximum identifiability (Ω) under different probing mechanisms (CAP, CSP, and UP) shows clear differences.
- For most networks, UP and CSP only guarantee unique localization of single-node failures, while CAP can handle multi-node failures.
- A larger gap is observed between ΩCAP and ΩCSP compared to the gap between ΩCSP and ΩUP, due to the sparsity of AS topologies, which limits the flexibility in selecting probing paths under cycle-free constraints.

### Specific Networks
- **AS1755**: |V| = 172, |L| = 381, µc = 69
- **AS6461**: |V| = 182, |L| = 294, µc = 121
- **AS3967**: |V| = 201, |L| = 434, µc = 106
- **AS3257**: |V| = 240, |L| = 404, µc = 123

### Observations
- The ordering of the normalized maximum identifiability (Ω/σ) is consistent with the minimum monitor fraction (µc/|V|).
- The results show a significant gap between ΩCAP and the other two mechanisms, and Ω/σ is inversely related to µc/|V|.

## Figure 9: Maximum Identifiability for CAIDA AS Topologies
### Specific Networks
- **AS28583**: |V| = 284, |L| = 415, µc = 211
- **AS10024**: |V| = 318, |L| = 336, µc = 270
- **AS15706**: |V| = 325, |L| = 874, µc = 282
- **AS26788**: |V| = 355, |L| = 483, µc = 316

### Observations
- CAIDA ASes require more monitors than Rocketfuel ASes, with the largest fraction µc/|V| being 0.89 for AS26788 and the smallest being 0.74 for AS28583.
- Even under the most flexible probing mechanism (CAP), only a few nodes can be localized with the minimum monitor placement.
- Without control over probing paths (i.e., UP), randomly placed monitors are unlikely to guarantee unique failure localization, emphasizing the need for optimized monitor placement and controllable probing.

## Conclusion
We have studied the fundamental capability of a network to localize failed nodes from the health condition of end-to-end paths between monitors. We introduced the concept of maximum identifiability to quantify this capability. We analyzed this measure for three families of probing mechanisms, each offering different trade-offs between controllability and implementation cost. Our evaluations on random and real network topologies reveal that giving monitors more control over probe routing, despite higher costs, significantly improves their ability to localize simultaneous failures.
