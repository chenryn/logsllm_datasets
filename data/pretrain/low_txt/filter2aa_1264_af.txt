### Glossary

**Single Sign-On (SSO)**: A feature that allows users to access additional services without re-entering their password, provided these services are configured to accept Kerberos tickets. Mac OS X Server uses Kerberos v5 for this purpose.

**Local Delivery Agent (LDA)**: A mail service agent responsible for transferring email messages from incoming mail storage to the recipient's inbox. The LDA ensures that local delivery of messages is handled and makes the mail accessible to the user’s email application.

**List Administrator**: An individual who manages a mailing list. List administrators can add or remove subscribers and designate other administrators. They do not need to be local machine or domain administrators.

**Load Balancing**: The process of distributing client requests for network services across multiple servers to optimize performance by fully utilizing the capacity of all available servers.

**Mail Access Agent (MAA)**: A mail service that communicates with a user’s email program to download mail messages or headers to the user’s local machine.

**Mail Exchanger / Mail Host**: The computer that provides mail services. These terms are synonymous.

**Mailing List**: A service that distributes a single email message to multiple recipients. Subscribers do not have to be mail users on your server, and the list can be managed by a list administrator. Subscribers often have the ability to add or remove themselves from the list.

**Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)**: A mail service that sends outgoing mail, receives incoming mail for local recipients, and forwards incoming mail for non-local recipients to other MTAs.

**Mail User Agent (MUA)**: A mail process on a user’s local machine that works with the MAA to download mail messages and headers. This is commonly referred to as an “email application” or “email program.”

**MX Record (Mail Exchange Record)**: An entry in a DNS table that specifies which computer manages mail for an Internet domain. When a mail server needs to deliver mail to a domain, it queries the MX record to determine the correct destination.

**Name Server**: See Domain Name System (DNS).

**Open Relay**: A server that automatically forwards received mail to another server. Spammers often exploit open relays to avoid blacklisting their own mail servers.

**ORBS (Open Relay Behavior-Modification System)**: An Internet service that blacklists mail servers known or suspected to be open relays for junk mail. ORBS servers are also known as RBL (Real-Time Blackhole List) servers.

**Percent Symbol (%)**: The command-line prompt in the Terminal application, indicating that a command can be entered.

**POP (Post Office Protocol)**: A protocol for retrieving incoming mail. Once a user retrieves POP mail, it is stored on the user’s computer and typically deleted from the mail server.

**Privileges**: Settings that define the level of access users have to shared items. Four types of privileges can be assigned: read and write, read only, write only, and no access.

**RBL (Real-Time Blackhole List)**: An Internet service that blacklists mail servers known or suspected to be open relays for junk mail.

**Short Name**: An abbreviated name for a user, used by Mac OS X for home directories, authentication, and email addresses.

**SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**: A protocol used to send and transfer mail. It has limited queuing capabilities, so it is primarily used for sending mail, while POP or IMAP is used for receiving mail.

**Spam**: Unsolicited email, also known as junk mail.

**SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)**: An Internet protocol that enables the secure transmission of encrypted, authenticated information over the Internet.

**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: A method used with the Internet Protocol (IP) to send data in the form of message units between computers over the Internet. IP handles the actual delivery of the data, while TCP keeps track of the individual data packets for efficient routing.

**UCE (Unsolicited Commercial Email)**: See spam.

**UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: A communication method that uses the Internet Protocol (IP) to send a data unit (datagram) from one computer to another in a network. UDP is used for applications that exchange small data units.

**UID (User ID)**: A unique number that identifies a user. Mac OS X uses the UID to manage a user’s directory and file ownership.

**User Name**: The full name for a user, sometimes referred to as the user’s “real” name. See also short name.

**Virtual Domain**: An additional domain that can be used in email addresses for your mail users. It represents a list of domain names for which your mail server is responsible.

**Virtual User**: An alternate email address (short name) for a user, similar to an alias but involving another user account.
