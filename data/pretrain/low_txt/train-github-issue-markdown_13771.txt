It appears there is a discrepancy between the information provided on the Celery project homepage (http://www.celeryproject.org/) and the Flask-Celery package page on PyPI (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask-Celery).

The Celery project homepage suggests that Celery can be easily integrated with Flask using the Flask-Celery add-on package. However, the Flask-Celery PyPI page clearly states in bold: "FROM CELERY 3.0 THIS LIBRARY IS NO LONGER NECESSARY, INSTEAD YOU SHOULD USE THE STANDARD CELERY API."

Given this information, it would be appropriate to update the Celery project homepage to reflect the current best practices. The suggestion to use the Flask-Celery add-on should be removed, and users should be directed to use the standard Celery API for integration with Flask.

Hereâ€™s a suggested revision for the Celery project homepage:

"Celery is easy to integrate with ... Flask, using the standard Celery API. For more information, please refer to the Celery documentation."

This change will help ensure that users are following the most up-to-date and recommended approach for integrating Celery with Flask.
