## Steps to Reproduce

I have encountered an issue where, upon navigating to a new page using the `pushReplacement` method, the AppBar displays a back button, which should not be present. Below is the code I am using to navigate to the new page:

```dart
Route route = new MaterialPageRoute(
  settings: new RouteSettings(name: "/PostAuthHome"),
  builder: (BuildContext context) => new PostAuthHome.PostAuthHome(title: "LOOP Home"),
);
Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement(route);
```

### Expected Behavior
- The new page should be displayed without a back button in the AppBar.

### Actual Behavior
- The new page is displayed with a back button in the AppBar.
