I am currently working on multiple projects that are mounted using SSHFS. As I frequently move between my home and office, these projects become temporarily inaccessible. Since Atom attempts to load previously opened tabs and folders upon startup, I often encounter a long list of red warning messages twice dailyâ€”once when I leave for the office and once when I return home.

It would be greatly beneficial to have an option to disable this behavior, as it does not serve a useful purpose in my situation.
