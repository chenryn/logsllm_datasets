### 7.3 Late Bids: Revenue & Network Cost

The broadcasting nature of Header Bidding (HB) results in a substantial number of bid requests being sent to multiple Demand Partners. Our study indicates that a typical website has a limited number of available ad-slots, ranging from 2 to 6 for the median case, depending on the type of HB. However, some auctions request more ad-slots than are actually available, sometimes up to 20. The most commonly auctioned ad-slots in HB are side banners and top banners. For each ad-slot, a parallel auction is conducted, soliciting bids from numerous Demand-Side Platforms (DSPs).

As expected, the more ad-slots present on a webpage, the higher the overall HB latency. When 1 to 3 ad-slots are auctioned, the median latency ranges from 0.3 to 0.57 seconds. For 3 to 5 slots, the median latency increases to 0.57 to 0.92 seconds.

This overwhelming volume of bid requests significantly escalates the required processing power for Ad Exchanges (ADXs) and DSP decision engines, leading to a dramatic rise in infrastructure costs [17]. Companies that began supporting HB experienced up to a 100% increase in bid requests, with some receiving between 5 million and 6 million requests per second, despite the number of available ad-slots remaining the same [50]. Interestingly, the same partners may compete for the same ad-slots multiple times: first in the HB process and then in the regular waterfall model, as publishers may fall back to the waterfall if HB does not yield sufficiently high prices for the auctioned slots [17].

In addition to increasing infrastructure costs, the surge in bid requests also extends the response time for DSPs, resulting in a significant number of delayed bids. We found that in over 50% of auctions, half of the bid responses arrive too late (after the publisher’s set threshold) to be considered, due to high latency. These late bids not only waste network resources and processing power from the perspective of Demand Partners but also result in potential revenue loss for publishers.

### 7.4 Limitations & Future Work

This study represents the first comprehensive analysis of the HB protocol and an effort to measure the ecosystem and partners involved. Despite the scarcity of HB documentation, we have reverse-engineered the protocol and analyzed the various HB libraries used by the crawled websites. Due to several limitations in the data collection process, this study focused on specific dimensions, leaving other aspects for future work. In follow-up research on HB, it is important to address the limitations of our HBDetector and expand the scope to include:

- **Extensive Analysis of HB Libraries:** Increase coverage of the ecosystem and websites employing HB.
- **Impact on User Experience (UX) and Page Load Time:** Study the detailed impact of HB on UX and page load times, as well as the hosting infrastructures responsible for the crawled websites, locations of Demand Partners, and categories of websites to find associations with HB prices and latencies.
- **Privacy Concerns:** Investigate the privacy of online users accessing HB-enabled websites for potential personally identifiable information (PII) leaks and measure the impact of HB on user anonymity. Additionally, assess the use of HTTP vs. HTTPS for HB transactions.
