### Incident Logs and Time Manipulation

**Incident Logs:**
- **Nov 18 13:46:54 important-server:** Hacker performs l33t hack.
- **Nov 18 13:47:47 important-server:** Hacker logs in.

**Time Manipulation:**
- **Through time manipulation or cron running:** The date is set to 'some random time'.
- **If the time is moved forward, it could cause log files to roll over and be purged.**
- **If there is no central logging, forensics may be challenging.**

### GPS Issues and Licenses

**From a Stingray Manual (Thanks to @VickerySec for finding this):**
- **External GPS:** Sometimes an external GPS device will emit erroneous GPS ticks, causing the Gemini activation license to expire.

### Data Center Roof Access

**What can we do if we have access to the data center roof?**
- **GPS Unit with Aerial on Roof:** Connect the GPS unit serially down.
- **GPS Unit in Server:** Use a radio down wire from the roof.
- **Attach Transmitter to Wire with Attenuator.**
- **Use Server IP 127.0.20.0.**
- **ntpd Configuration:** Configure ntpd to look at `/dev/gps0` and `/dev/pps0` for import.

### NMEA Data and PPS

**NMEA Data – Serial Data (`/dev/gps0`):**
- **$GPGGA,062237.000,4117.4155,S,17445.3752,E,1,9,0.97,177.1,M,19.0,M,,*4A**
- **$GPRMC,062237.000,A,4117.4155,S,17445.3752,E,0.16,262.97,120217,,,A*7E**
- **Hour, Minute, Second, Day, Month, Year**

**Pulse Per Second (PPS) (`/dev/pps0`):**
- **Doesn't contain a time value but indicates the start of a second.**
- **Less processing on the GPS receiver, so it comes through more timely.**
- **Rising edge can be in micro or nanosecond accuracy.**

### NTP Setup and Spoofing

**NTP Setup:**
- **Raspberry Pi with NTPd Running:**
  - **GPS Receiver via UART serial on GPIO pins.**
  - **One wire for PPS.**
- **Link the PPS pin to another GPIO pin and set that pin high and low as applicable.**

**Spoofing PPS:**
- **Running PPS with different timing will cause NMEA data to keep correcting, pulling it back within ±1 second.**
- **This can be critical in finance, telecoms, and energy sectors where fractions of a second matter.**

**If the NTPd Tx wire is pulled:**
- **The source in NTPd stops, even if getting PPS signal.**
- **Time cannot be manipulated just through PPS manipulation.**
- **Can we remove the NMEA data?**

### Python Script and NMEAdesync

**Python Script:**
- **Moves time back in steps to avoid crashing NTPd.**
- **Discussed in detail at BSidesCBR.**
  - **Slides:** [BSidesCBR-ZXSecurity_Practical_GPS_Spoofing.pdf](https://zxsecurity.co.nz/presentations/201703_BSidesCBR-ZXSecurity_Practical_GPS_Spoofing.pdf)
  - **Code:** [NMEAdesync on GitHub](https://github.com/zxsecurity/NMEAdesync)

**NMEAdesync:**
- **Similar in concept to tardgps but changes the data in the NMEA data rather than the GPS signal.**
- **Adjusts the time and how fast a second is.**
- **Also generates PPS and offers more control than tardgps without GPS signal tomfoolery.**

**NMEAdesync Under the Hood:**
- **Python script outputs $GPRMC and $GPGGA.**
- **PPS high/low on pin, loop, and socat stdout to /dev/pts/X.**
- **Symlink /dev/pts/X to /dev/gps0, and ntpd takes it from there.**

**NMEAdesync Running:**
- **Behavior similar to tardgps but simpler to execute without the radio aspect.**
- **Requires physical access to the roof of the building.**

### GPS Signal Spoofing and Detection

**GPS Signal Spoofing:**
- **Talked in more detail at Unrestcon 2016.**
  - **Slides:** [Unrestcon-ZXSecurity_GPSSpoofing.pdf](https://zxsecurity.co.nz/presentations/201607_Unrestcon-ZXSecurity_GPSSpoofing.pdf)
  - **Code:** [GPSnitch on GitHub](https://github.com/zxsecurity/gpsnitch)

**Detection:**
- **Time offset, SNR values, SNR range, and location stationary.**
- **Demo available.**

**NTP Servers and GPS Units:**
- **Useful for NMEA serial spoofing.**
- **How to detect:**
  - **[NMEA Snitch on GitHub](https://github.com/zxsecurity/NMEAsnitch)**
  - **Records NMEA sentences and looks at the ratios and sentences per second.**
  - **Alerts when the rate of sentences doesn’t match the norm.**

### NTP Setups to Avoid GPS Spoofing

- **3+ Upstream:**
  - **Allows for bad ticker detection and removal.**
  - **Multiple types of upstream (e.g., GPS, Atomic).**
  - **Don’t pick just one upstream provider.**
  - **Consider an overseas provider for a coarse sanity check of time.**

**Considerations:**
- **Atomic, caesium, rubidium clocks for “air-gapped” networks.**
- **Incorporate GPSnitch.**
- **Additional logging for when daemon shuts down due to a time jump.**
- **Prompt user to accept time jump on daemon restart after a large time jump.**
