### Title: Black Hat US-18: For the Love of Money: Finding and Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Mobile Point of Sale Systems

In today's business landscape, it is rare to find a company that does not accept fast payment methods. The proliferation of Mobile Point of Sale (mPOS) terminals has significantly lowered the barriers for small and micro-sized businesses to process non-cash transactions. Despite the advancements, older payment technologies like magnetic stripe (mag-stripe) still dominate the majority of in-person transactions. The introduction of new payment standards, such as Near Field Communication (NFC), further complicates this ecosystem. With each new iteration in payment technology, new vulnerabilities are introduced into an already complex system.

In this presentation, we will explore the security and fraud implications of reducing the economic barriers to accepting card payments. We will also examine the risks associated with continued reliance on outdated card standards like mag-stripe. Historically, testing for payment attack vectors has been confined to individual projects and those with permanent access to POS and payment infrastructure. However, this is no longer the case.

Our research, which we believe to be the most comprehensive in this field, focuses on four major mPOS providers across the United States and Europe: Square, SumUp, iZettle, and PayPal. We will provide live demonstrations of newly discovered vulnerabilities, including:

- Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks on transactions
- Sending arbitrary code via Bluetooth and mobile applications
- Modifying payment values for mag-stripe transactions
- Exploiting firmware vulnerabilities to perform Denial of Service (DoS) and Remote Code Execution (RCE)

By adopting a geographically diverse approach, we aim to illustrate the current attack surface of mPOS systems and predict how these vulnerabilities may evolve in the future.

For audience members interested in integrating robust testing practices into their organizations or research, we will demonstrate how to use mPOS systems to identify weaknesses in payment technologies. Additionally, we will share strategies for remaining undetected despite the presence of anti-fraud and security mechanisms.
