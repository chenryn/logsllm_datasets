### Multi-Tenant Cloud Services

- **Amazon EC2**
- **Microsoft Azure**
- **Google Cloud Services**
- **Countless fly-by-night VPS hosting providers online**
- **Brick-and-mortar data centers serving local clients**

**Similarities:**
- Most run some form of Xen (OS Xen, XenServer)
- Some use VMware or Hyper-V
- All share network connectivity between tenants

## Key Question
© 2015 Ronny L. Bull - Clarkson University

- **Do Layer 2 network attacks that typically work on physical devices also apply to their virtualized counterparts?**
- **Importance:**
  - All cloud services relying on virtualized environments could be vulnerable.
  - This includes data centers hosting mission-critical or sensitive data.
- **Other Considerations:**
  - Not the only class of attacks from co-located VMs.
  - Old lesson: Vulnerable to those close to you.

## Bottom Line

- **Initial research experiments show that virtualized network devices can be exploited similarly to physical devices.**
- **Some environments allow the attack to spill out of the virtualized network and affect the physical networks they are connected to.**
  - Example: MAC Flooding in Citrix XenServer
    - Allows eavesdropping on both physical and virtual network traffic.

## Possible Attacks

- **What if another tenant can successfully launch a Layer 2 network attack within a multi-tenant environment?**
  - Capture all network traffic
  - Redirect traffic
  - Perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks
  - Denial of Service (DoS)
  - Gain unauthorized access to restricted sub-networks
  - Affect performance

### Bridging
© 2015 Ronny L. Bull - Clarkson University

- **Physical bridges connect two or more segments at Layer 2:**
  - Separate collision domains
  - Maintain MAC address forwarding table for each segment
  - Forward requests based on destination MAC addresses
  - Do not cross the bridge if the destination is on the same segment as the source
  - Cross if the destination is on a different segment connected to the bridge

### Ethernet Frame

- **Preamble (8 bytes)**
- **Destination Address (6 bytes)**
- **Source Address (6 bytes)**
- **Type/Length (2 bytes)**
- **Data (~)**
- **Frame Check Sequence (FCS, 4 bytes)**

### Virtual Bridges

- **Simplest form of virtual networking:**
  - Uses 802.1d Ethernet Bridging
  - Support built into the Linux kernel and bridge-utils user-space package
  - Uses virtual TAP interfaces to connect virtual machines to a virtual bridge (e.g., tap0)
  - Simulates a Layer 2 (link layer) network device

### Switching

- **Physical switches operate at Layer 2 or higher:**
  - Multi-port bridges
  - Separate collision domains
  - CAM Table (Content Addressable Memory)
    - Similar to bridge forwarding table
    - Dynamic table that maps MAC addresses to ports
    - Finite amount of memory!

### Virtual Switches

- **Advanced form of virtual networking:**
  - Can emulate Layer 2 and higher physical devices
  - Virtual machines connect to vSwitch via virtual interfaces (e.g., vif0)
  - Provide services such as:
    - Quality of Service (QoS)
    - VLAN traffic separation
    - Performance and traffic monitoring

- **Variety of virtual switches available:**
  - Open vSwitch (OS Xen, Citrix XenServer, KVM, Proxmox)
  - Cisco Nexus 1000V Series (VMware vSphere, MS Hyper-V)
  - Microsoft Hyper-V Virtual Switch (Microsoft Hyper-V)

- **All are considered enterprise-level solutions.**

## Test Environment
- **Cloud Security Research Lab**
- **Hardware Specifications** (full system specs provided in the white paper on the DEFCON 23 CD)

### MAC Flooding Attack
© 2015 Ronny L. Bull - Clarkson University

- **MAC Flooding:**
  - Flood switch with numerous random MAC addresses to fill the CAM table buffer
  - Forces switch into fail-safe mode (a.k.a. Hub mode)
  - All frames forwarded to all connected devices
  - Breaks collision domain separation
  - Works well on most physical switches

- **Demos:**
  - Gentoo / OS Xen – 802.1d Linux Bridging
    - [YouTube Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh-aOy9gu9I)
  - Gentoo / OS Xen – Open vSwitch 2.0.0
    - [YouTube Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzuQI_XUgKc)
  - Citrix XenServer 6.2 – Open vSwitch 1.4.6
    - [YouTube Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1JQg5YXfY4)

- **Summary:**
  - Reported Open vSwitch vulnerability to cert.org (Assigned VU#784996)
  - No response as of yet
  - Implementation of MAC learning fairness patch applied to all versions of Open vSwitch >= 2.0.0
    - [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs/commit/2577b9346b9b77feb94b34398b54b8f19fcff4bd)

### MAC Flooding Mitigation

- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - Enforce port security on physical switches
  - Limit the number of MAC addresses that can be learned via a single port
  - Only allow authorized MAC addresses to connect to a single port on the switch
  - Disable unused switch ports

### DHCP Attacks

- **DHCP Protocol:**
  - Automates IP address allocation and provides other network information
  - Options include Subnet Mask, Default Gateway, DNS Servers, WINS Servers, TFTP Servers

- **Client-Server Model:**
  - DHCP allows administrators to pass many options to clients
  - Options defined by DHCP Option Code numbers (e.g., Time Server, Domain Name, ARP Cache Timeout, SMTP Server)
  - Options defined in [RFC 2132 - DHCP Options](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2132)

- **DHCP Attacks:**
  - Details and scenarios to be discussed
