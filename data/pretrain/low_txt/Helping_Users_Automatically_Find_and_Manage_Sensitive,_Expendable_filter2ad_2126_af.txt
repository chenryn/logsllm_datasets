### Improved Text

The classifier performed better for images than for documents. This discrepancy may be an artifact of the underlying data, but we hypothesize that certain significant features in images, such as "adult," "racy," and "violent" content, are more easily detectable across different users. For documents, while there are standardized classes of significant and identifiable features (e.g., Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and financial information), qualitative responses from participants suggest a strong temporal relevance to these features. Our classifier does not account for context, whether temporal or otherwise.

Participants also described some sensitive images as having sentimental value (e.g., pictures of children or loved ones). Directly predicting this type of sensitivity from our current features is not feasible, and this task merits deeper investigation.

Future work to improve our understanding of file sensitivity and management should focus on longitudinal studies. This will allow us to passively observe participants' actions over time, rather than actively asking them to make management decisions. Longitudinal data will enable the development of a sensitivity persona that can account for variations in individual perceptions of sensitivity. The success of a classifier largely depends on the training and testing data coming from the same distribution. If the covariate distribution changes over time, a problem known as concept drift, the classifiers would need to be updated to account for this drift to maintain performance. While we lacked longitudinal data in this study and were unable to check for concept drift, a quantitative evaluation of its effect on classifier performance for retrospective file management would be a valuable direction for future research.

Additionally, future work should aim to broaden the participant pool to minimize potential biases and better account for cultural diversity. It should also explore the trade-off between file management and the associated risk of sensitive files. This can be achieved by developing and widely deploying an effective user management interface with additional surveys, which can efficiently surface these ideas. Overall, these efforts would address our current limitations and operationalize the results of our work to improve Aletheia’s performance.
