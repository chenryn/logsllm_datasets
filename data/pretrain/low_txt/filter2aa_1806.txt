#### Disclaimer
Some of the topics in this presentation may be used to break the law in new and exciting ways. However, we do not recommend breaking the law. It is your responsibility to check your local laws and abide by them. Do not blame us if a three-letter organization knocks on your door.

### History of WEP Attacks and Why They Don't Work
- **Passive Sniffing**
  - Slow, requires a lot of data, and can be impractical due to impatience.
  - No more weak IVs.
- **Replay/Injection Attacks**
  - Fast but very noisy.
  - Simple signatures.
  - AP features like PSPF (Protected Setup Protocol Framework) try to block these attacks.

### History of WPA Attacks and Why They Don't Work
- **Pre-Shared Key (PSK)**
  - Requires catching both sides of a quick handshake.
  - Must be in range of both the client and the AP.
- **Enterprise**
  - Nearly impossible to crack passively.
  - Most EAP types are difficult (at best) to man-in-the-middle (MiTM).

### The Well-Guarded Door
- Nearly 100% of attacks focus on the Access Point (AP).
- APs are becoming increasingly secure with new features:
  - PSPF / Client Isolation
  - Strong Authentication / Encryption
  - Lightweight controller-based architecture
- APs are no longer the unguarded back door; they are well-deployed with security in mind and follow industry best practices.

### Take the Path of Least Resistance
- **Attack the Clients!**
  - Tools have slowly appeared recently, but they are difficult to use and have odd requirements.

### Attacking Client Keys
- **WEP**
  - Wep0ff
  - Caffe-Latte
  - Caffe-Latte Frag
- **WPA-PSK**
  - No public implementation available.
- **WPA-Enterprise**
  - Freeradius-wpe (thanks to Brad and Josh!)
  - Requires hardware AP.

### Challenges in Attacking the Client
- Many separate tools that are difficult to configure.
- Typically sparsely documented.
- Odd requirements and configurations.

### Introducing Airbase-ng
- Merges many tools into one.
- New and improved, simplified implementations.
- Full monitor mode AP simulation, needs no extra hardware.
- Easy, fast, and deadly (to encryption keys at least).

### Airbase-ng Demo
- **Evil Twin / Honey Pot**
- **Karma**
- **WEP attacks**
- **WPA-PSK attacks**
- **WPA-Enterprise attacks** (if completed in time)

### Ethical Considerations
- This does not promise a win; there are ways to defend as well.
- APs are finally being configured securely, and now clients must be as well.

### Simple Defenses
- **Proper Secure Client Configurations**
  - Check the right boxes.
  - Group Policy Objects (GPO).
  - (This section is still in progress. Please download the final slides from the link at the end of the presentation.)

### Beyond the Basics
- **Wireless Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (WIPS)**
  - Designed to detect and sometimes even prevent attacks.
  - (A full explanation of WIPS systems and features will follow, with no vendor bashing. Rick is still gaining permissions required by his employer, so this section will be left uncompleted for now.)

### A Step Beyond Crazy
- **WiFi Frequencies**
  - 802.11b/g: 2412-2462 MHz (US)
  - 802.11a: 5180-5320 MHz, 5745-5825 MHz (US)
  - Does this look odd to anyone else?

### Licensed Bands
- Some vendors carry licensed radios.
- Special Wi-Fi cards for use by military and public safety.
- Typically expensive and require a license to purchase.
- Frequencies of 4920 MHz seem surprisingly close to 5180 MHz.

### Can We Do This Cheaper?
- Atheros and others sometimes support more channels.
- Allows for one radio to be sold for many purposes.
- Software controls allowed frequencies.

### Who Controls the Software?
- Typically, the chipset vendors.
- Most Wi-Fi drivers in Linux require binary firmware.
- This firmware controls regulatory compliance and purposing.

### What Can We Do?
- Fortunately, most Linux users don’t like closed-source binaries.
- Fully open-sourced drivers are being developed.
- As these drivers become stable, we can start to experiment.

### Let’s Play…
- **Madwifi-ng** is driven by a binary HAL.
- **Ath5k** is the next-gen fully open-source driver.
- Kugutsumen released a patch for "DEBUG" regdomain.
  - Allows tuning to all supported channels.

### New Toys
- **Yesterday:**
  - 802.11b/g: 2412-2462 MHz (US)
  - 802.11a: 5180-5320 MHz, 5745-5825 MHz (US)
- **Today:**
  - 802.11a: 4920-6100 MHz (DEBUG)

### What to Do Now?
- What is on these new frequencies?
- (Insert full image of frequency map)
- But does it really work?

### Spectrum Analyzer Demo
- Fully tested frequencies (complete testing is ongoing).
- Warning: This may differ from card to card.

### Limitations
- Many real licensed implementations are broken.
- Card reports channel 1 but is actually on 4920 MHz.
- This is done to make it easy to use existing drivers.
- This breaks many open-source applications.

### Airodump-ng
- Supports a list of frequencies to scan rather than channels.
- Only channels are shown in the display, which may be incorrect.
- Strips vital header information off the packet, making data saved from extended channels useless.

### Kismet
- At the time of writing, unable to handle most extended channels.
- Displays channels, not frequencies.
- Does save usable pcap files.

### Improvement Needed
- Sniffers are too trusting; they believe what they see.
- Never intended to deal with oddly broken implementations such as channel number fudging.
- Sniffers need to be improved to report more reality and fewer assumptions.

### Final Thoughts
- Remember, everyone here is a white hat.
- Please use your newfound knowledge for good, not evil.
- In the United States, it is legal to monitor all radio frequencies (except those used by cell phones).
- Have fun…
