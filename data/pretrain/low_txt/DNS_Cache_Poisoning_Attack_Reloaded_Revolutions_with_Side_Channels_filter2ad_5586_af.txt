#### DNS Blind Forgery Attacks and Cache Poisoning
After the major DNS cache poisoning attack in 2008 [39], numerous defenses have been implemented, making such blind off-path attacks significantly more difficult. Several studies have continued to investigate the feasibility of new attacks in the presence of state-of-the-art defenses.

Herzberg and Shulman [30] proposed a method to de-randomize the source port of a resolver behind NAT by occupying all but one port on the NAT with the help of a dummy machine in the same network as the resolver. They also introduced a name-server-pinning method leveraging IP fragmentation. However, this attack is not applicable to resolvers with a public IP address, which is believed to be the common case. Alharbi et al. [5] conducted a similar attack to exhaust local ports on a client machine and poison the OS-wide DNS cache.

In another work, Herzberg and Shulman [31] proposed a novel IP fragmentation technique to target resolvers, eliminating the need to guess randomized source port numbers, server addresses, and query names. Instead, only the IPID becomes the secret that needs to be guessed. The key assumption is that the response from the victim domain is voluntarily fragmented (e.g., when DNSSEC is enabled). Brandt et al. [9] relaxed this constraint by injecting ICMP fragmentation needed error messages to an authoritative name server, proactively lowering its MTU (with respect to the resolver) and inducing fragmentation. This attack depends on the exact server configuration, as many servers simply reject such ICMP packets or maintain a minimum MTU larger than needed to fragment a DNS response. Additionally, predicting IPID precisely has become more challenging over time due to increased randomness [4]. Despite this, Wang et al. [60] developed a novel attack targeting DNS forwarders by forcing fragmentation using attacker-owned authoritative name servers.

Overall, our approach leverages a universal network side channel based on the ICMP global rate limit, which we show to be prevalent. Our attack is effective against all layers of DNS caches, not just resolvers.

#### Network Side Channel Vulnerabilities
For decades, researchers have used network side channels to infer sensitive network information, such as port scans [26], TCP sequence number inference [11, 45, 50], and others [3, 42].

The only work classified as a side channel in DNS source port inference is by Herzberg and Shulman [32]. They proposed using low-rate bursts of packets to overload specific source ports on resolvers, potentially causing legitimate DNS replies destined for those ports to be dropped. This creates a timing side channel: longer end-to-end response times indicate that a port is in use, while shorter times indicate it is not. Unfortunately, this requires the attacker and the resolver to be co-located in a low-latency network environment, such as a LAN, due to its sensitivity to network noise. In contrast, our source port scan technique is more direct and reliable, allowing it to be carried out from a distance.

Additionally, the concept of leveraging global rate limits in network protocols as a side channel has been documented in several important works. For example, TCP RST rate limit [12, 26] and TCP challenge ACK rate limit [11] have been demonstrated and reported in the past. The ICMP rate limit, while similar in principle, is perhaps even more subtle as it appears during interactions across layers (i.e., UDP and ICMP).

### 10. Conclusion
This paper presents a novel and general side channel based on the global ICMP rate limit, universally implemented by all modern operating systems. This allows efficient scans of UDP source ports in DNS queries. Combined with techniques to extend the attack window, it leads to a powerful revival of the DNS cache poisoning attack, demonstrated with real-world experiments under realistic server configurations and network conditions. Finally, we suggest practical mitigations that can be used to raise the bar against such attacks.
