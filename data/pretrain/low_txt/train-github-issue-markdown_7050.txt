A few days ago, I encountered an issue that I believe to be a bug. After installing the "ImageView" package, the command `sin(BigFloat(3))` consistently produces an error message (please see the attached screenshot). This problem affects Julia versions 1.2, 1.3 RC3, and the latest nightly build.

I have been able to reproduce this error on my Windows 10 system (Intel Core-i3, 4 GB RAM, Developer Mode) as often as needed, even after completely reinstalling Windows. Interestingly, in approximately one out of ten attempts to uninstall and then reinstall Julia, the error did not occur. Additionally, when I installed Julia on another computer, it worked without any errors.

I have already reported this issue to a member of the JuliaImages/ImageView.jl team (timholy), who suggested that I report it as a Julia bug. The relevant GitHub issue can be found [here](https://github.com/JuliaImages/ImageView.jl/issues/181).
