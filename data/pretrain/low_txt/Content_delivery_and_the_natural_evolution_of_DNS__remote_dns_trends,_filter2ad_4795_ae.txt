### 5.4.2 Performance Comparison Utility

**namehelp** also includes a DNS benchmarking tool based on **namebench** [18]. To compare DNS services, we adopt the approach used by **namebench**, which queries both public and ISP DNS servers for a set of domain names. By default, a list of popular sites from Alexa.com is used, but users can personalize the results using their web browser history. The tool ranks DNS servers by mean response time and identifies potential server-specific issues (e.g., NXDOMAIN hijacking [31]).

The **namehelp** benchmarking service extends the functionality of **namebench** to evaluate CDN performance via different DNS services. Tests can be run against a list of popular websites or tailored with a user’s browsing history. Additionally, the tool checks for EDNS-Client-Subnet support, given its potential performance benefits when available (§4.3).

To evaluate end-to-end CDN performance provided by a DNS service, **namehelp** benchmarking downloads selected web pages and their linked objects (i.e., images, scripts, and stylesheets) using the given DNS service to resolve domain names. We determine end-to-end latency using the methodology from §3.3. For simplicity, we use a single-threaded architecture for downloading web objects. Although optimizations such as parallel connections and HTTP pipelining could reduce the overall download time, our approach provides comparable results for end-to-end performance between public DNS services. Caching of DNS lookups and HTTP objects, when possible, minimizes the test’s run time and bandwidth consumption.

The results of these tests are presented to the user, enabling them to make an informed decision regarding which DNS service to use, based not only on DNS performance (as in **namebench**) but also on the resulting CDN performance.

### 6. Related Work

Our work builds upon and significantly extends several past studies on DNS, CDNs, and their interaction.

**Johnson et al.** [10] studied the redirection performance of CDNs and concluded that they succeed not by selecting optimal servers, but rather by avoiding making bad decisions. **Wang et al.** [33] analyzed methods to maximize CDN objectives, such as improving response time and system throughput under various loads. **Nygren et al.** [19] described several aspects of Akamai's network, and **Triukose et al.** [29] studied Akamai's performance. **WhyHigh** [14] is a tool used by Google to identify and diagnose client performance issues from the CDN’s perspective. While a detailed view of a CDN’s network is valuable, accurately capturing the end-user’s perceived performance under different settings remains a challenge. In this work, we capture the end user’s perspective to accurately characterize the end-to-end performance impact of remote DNS usage.

**DNS and CDNs**: DNS is a critical component of the Internet infrastructure. Since the retrospective study by **Mockapetris and Dunlap** [17], it has been the subject of several measurement analyses (e.g., [1, 11, 15, 16, 22, 25]) and proposed design alternatives (including [23, 24]). Several studies [1, 9, 12, 16, 25] have evaluated different aspects of DNS-based redirections and CDNs. **Mao et al.** [16] determined that DNS-based redirection is sufficient for coarse-grained (e.g., AS-level) server selection but not as precise at the granularity of BGP prefixes. **Shaikh et al.** [25] found that the ping time to a client’s DNS server is a poor predictor of ping time to the actual client. The recent growth in the usage of remote DNS services, such as OpenDNS [20, 21] and Google DNS [6], has motivated studies on the implications of remote DNS and its interactions with CDN redirections.

In a preliminary study by **Ager et al.** [1], the authors reported that typically-employed load balancing techniques have a detrimental effect on DNS caching and that public DNS-based redirection is less likely to point users to an available copy of content within their own network. **Huang et al.** [9] documented that a user’s nearest public DNS server is often farther away than their ISP-provided DNS server, and using a more distant public DNS server can result in redirections to edge servers that are even farther away. Our work builds on and extends these studies by evaluating the end-to-end performance impact of remote DNS on CDNs and conducting an extensive diagnosis of the results.

**Solutions**: Several approaches have been proposed to address the poor interaction between remote DNS and CDN redirections. **Khosla et al.** [12] studied the interaction between “cloud-based” remote DNS and Akamai redirections and discussed several possible approaches to mitigate the performance penalty. **Huang et al.** [8] proposed an application-level solution to address the mismatch between client and local DNS resolvers. Industry players have formed the “Global Internet Speedup” [28] collaboration, advocating for the adoption of the proposed EDNS-Client-Subnet DNS extension [3], which passes part of a client’s IP address to CDNs to improve DNS-based server selection decisions. Our work presents the first evaluation of the performance benefits and adoption of this DNS extension. Additionally, we propose and evaluate a general client-based solution, **Direct Resolution**, which allows unmodified applications to benefit from improved redirections. We describe **namehelp**, an implementation of the Direct Resolution approach, and evaluate its performance benefits.

### 7. Conclusion

We explored the end-to-end impact of using remote DNS services on CDN performance and presented the first evaluation of an industry-proposed solution to the problem. We showed that remote DNS usage can significantly impact client web performance and that the proposed solution, if available, can effectively address the problem for most clients. Considering the performance cost of remote DNS usage and the limited adoption base of the industry-proposed solution, we present and evaluate **Direct Resolution**, an alternative approach to readily obtain comparable performance improvements without requiring CDN or DNS participation. We have implemented our approach as part of **namehelp**, a DNS proxy running on the client local host. **namehelp** also provides a benchmark service, comparing the impact of alternative DNS services on CDN performance. We have made **namehelp** publicly available. We continue to monitor the adoption of the EDNS-Client-Subnet DNS extension by DNS services and CDNs. We are also studying approaches for evaluating the potential performance benefits of this extension when providing partial client location information, while investigating alternative heuristics to improve **namehelp**’s performance.
