I was considering recommending Atom to a friend and visited the official website at [https://atom.io/](https://atom.io/) to check for Windows builds. The site detected that I was using Linux and displayed links for .deb and .rpm packages, along with a link for "Other platforms." 

On the "Other platforms" page, I found the following text:
> Prebuilt versions of Atom are available for OS X 10.8 or later, Windows 7 & 8, RedHat Linux, and Ubuntu Linux.

However, the page does not provide direct links to these prebuilt versions, nor does it offer any assurance that they actually exist. This lack of information and direct access to the installers makes it difficult to download them for offline installation on another computer. It seems I would be out of luck if I wanted to save one of their installers to a flash drive for use on a different machine without an internet connection.
