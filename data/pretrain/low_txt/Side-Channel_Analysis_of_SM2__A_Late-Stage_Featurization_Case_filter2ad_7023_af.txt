## Figures

### Figure 8: Partial Raw Cache-Timing Traces During SM2DSA
- **Top:** Ladder scalar multiplication composed of regular double and add operations.
- **Bottom:** FLT modular inversion via exponentiation composed of regular squaring windows followed by a single multiply.

### Figure 9: Filtered EM Trace After Applying the Ladder Countermeasure
- **Description:** The filtered EM trace clearly reveals the sequence of ECC double and add operations during SM2PKE decryption. However, this sequence is regular and not useful for side-channel analysis (SCA)-enabled attackers.

### Figure 10: T-Test Results
- **Top:** T-test results between sets S1 and S2 versus sample index; for fixed vs random k, the test marginally fails with leaks at the few points where the threshold is around 6.
- **Bottom:** T-test results between sets S1 and S3 versus sample index; for fixed vs random C, the test passes since no peaks exceed the 4.5 threshold.

### Analysis
- **Observation:** For (S1, S2), we still observe a marginal number of peaks with magnitude roughly 6. In theory, it is still possible to exploit this, e.g., a key value leading to special intermediate points on the curve such as zero-value or same value points. However, the leakage is so minimal that mounting such attacks would be extremely difficult and feature significant data complexity.
- **Countermeasure:** The scalar randomization countermeasure to thwart this leak introduces performance overhead, which is unacceptable to OpenSSL when weighed against the risk.

### Figure Descriptions
- **Figure 8:** Latency (cycles) vs. Time (samples) for double and add probes.
- **Figure 9:** Latency (cycles) vs. Time (samples) for multiply and square probes.
- **Figure 10:** Time (samples) vs. T-test values for different sets.
