### Example: RxPayouts' Photo ID Requirement and Affiliate Reaction

In late January 2012, RxPayouts introduced a photo ID requirement for new customers, which sparked significant discontent among its affiliates. On an English-speaking forum dedicated to pharmaceutical affiliates, one RxPayouts affiliate expressed their frustration: "This new rule is killing me; my conversion rate for new customers has dropped to zero. As soon as new customers find out they have to fax a photo ID to customer service, they cancel their orders." Another affiliate reported that only about 10% of their orders were being completed.

### Blacklisting

Before processing a transaction, it is common practice to evaluate the fraud risk associated with a customer. New customers, for instance, are often considered higher risk. If a transaction originates from an IP address previously linked to a chargeback or declined payment, the risk is even higher. We have observed shop runners manually filtering out orders from specific individuals suspected to be undercover operatives [8]. Some shops filter out IP addresses associated with past unsuccessful transactions, while others refuse to process payments on credit cards with certain Bank Identification Numbers (BINs). This approach forced our group to partner with multiple issuers to obtain a diverse set of BINs for the payment cards used in our study [16]. Additionally, we have identified distressed programs that use IP geolocation to restrict payment options, such as blocking U.S. purchases. For example, after several merchant accounts were shut down, the 4RX program stopped offering Visa to U.S. customers, but accessing the site via a European IP address still provided a Visa payment option. These techniques increase the complexity and burden for undercover purchasing, requiring greater diversity in IP addresses, geographic locations, BINs, and names.

### Accepting Only Existing Customers

Some programs have chosen to "weather the storm" by accepting orders only from existing customers. While this strategy can significantly reduce revenue, McCoy et al. have documented that repeat orders can account for up to 30% of overall sales [11].

### Complaint Bypass

The complaint process for targeted interventions involves a brand holder claiming that a given site is infringing on their intellectual property. The acquiring bank is then pressured to take action based on card association contract rules that prohibit supporting infringing merchants. However, only the brand holder has the standing to issue such a complaint, as they are presumed to be the only party capable of verifying unauthorized sales.

During the OEM software action, we identified two affiliate programs, OmegabidSoft and CD OEM, who removed the software offered by the complaining brand holder. While they continued to sell counterfeit software by other brands, the complainant no longer had standing to make a case. This likely explains why the associated banks, B+S Card Services and Wirecard, allowed these merchant accounts to continue processing orders despite multiple complaints. In principle, another affected brand holder could have complained, but this would require more coordination.

Similarly, in the last two months, several pharmaceutical programs have started replacing brand-name drugs with generic equivalents (e.g., Sildenafil Citrate instead of Viagra, Tadalafil instead of Cialis). Program operators argue that this will eliminate brand and trademark issues, making it harder for brand holders to shut down individual sites and associated merchant accounts. However, this strategy may impact consumer conversion, as not all customers are familiar with generic drug names. It remains unclear how effective this tactic will be, as card associations may still have the flexibility to include patent violations in their contracts.

### Evasion

Independent of targeted complaints, affiliate programs must also deal with increased scrutiny from card associations and the difficulty of obtaining new merchant accounts once old ones are shut down. For example, it has become extremely difficult for online pharmacies to secure new merchant accounts. Many pharmaceutical programs have thus engaged in various efforts to bypass these restrictions, including miscoding. When our study began in 2010, nearly 90% of pharmaceutical transactions were correctly coded with MCC 5192 or MCC 5122 (appropriate codes for pharmaceuticals). After these codes were specifically mentioned in Visa’s Global Brand Protection Program (GBPP) announcement, correct coding diminished. Currently, almost 70% of pharmaceutical transactions over the past two months are miscoded (e.g., as Cosmetics, Grocery Stores, etc.). The State Bank of Mauritius is now the only bank that both correctly codes such transactions and supports a large number of affiliate programs.

We also observe that some programs (or their Payment Service Providers, PSPs) are resorting to increasingly risky processing arrangements, such as laundering the nature of their business through an existing business of a different character. For example, between August and October 2011, both RXAffiliateNetwork and ZedCash used an online wallet provider (similar to PayPal) as an aggregator. In another instance, an OEM software affiliate (Eurosoft) processed payments through the merchant account of a rental car agency in Spain. With increased pressure on OEM software affiliate programs, we have recently seen attempts to execute payments through banks located in the United States. These arrangements are more fragile than traditional merchant accounts and are aggressively shut down by many banks once discovered.

### Alternative Payments

While payment card networks have the largest footprint for Western consumers, they are not the only payment mechanisms. Several pharmaceutical programs with disabled processing (e.g., 4RX) have attempted to continue business using Western Union and eCheck payments. A few U.S.-based pharmaceutical programs, such as Health Solutions Network, enabled Cash-On-Delivery (COD) payments when their Visa processing was disabled. The effectiveness of these alternative payment methods depends on consumer familiarity, the availability of more traditional payment options, and consumer motivation. While some programs, particularly in the OEM software space, have tried to continue using alternative payment mechanisms like PayPal and Bitcoin, these efforts have generally not been successful.

### Conclusion

Security interventions should be evaluated based on their impact on disrupting adversaries and the cost to defenders. Targeting the payment tier of abuse-advertising appears to be a promising approach. For a modest online purchase, it is possible to identify and terminate a portion of the underlying payment infrastructure within weeks, at a cost far lower than the intervention itself. There are only a limited number of banks providing high-risk services, so concentrated actions with key financial institutions can have a significant impact. Our observations indicate that this approach is most effective when there is comprehensive intelligence about all involved programs and a relentless follow-up on a per-program basis. While sporadic account takedowns do raise costs for program sponsors, sustained focus is necessary to convince operators to cease operations.

### Acknowledgments

This study benefited from the support of numerous individuals and organizations. We are deeply grateful to our card issuers and those who helped place trace purchases on our behalf. We also thank key brand holders and financial service providers for their critical insights and support. Legal and ethical guidance from Erin Kenneally, oversight from Daniel Park (UCSD’s Chief Counsel), and Patrick Schlesinger (UC’s System-wide Research Compliance office) were invaluable. We appreciate the ongoing systems and storage support from Brian Kantor and Cindy Moore, and we recognize the anonymous reviewers for their feedback and critiques.
