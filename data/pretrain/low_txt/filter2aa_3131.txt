- **Raymond:** 06/25/2013 3:58 P.M.

#### Kwikset Locks: A Spectrum Brands Company
- **Millions in Use in America and Canada:**
  - Homes, apartments, businesses
- **Inexpensive: Cost $20-$30**
- **Models:**
  - Pin tumbler (5 and 6 pin)
  - SmartKey (5 pin)
  - Deadbolts
  - Electronic with override

#### One of the Most Popular Locks in the U.S.
- **Millions Sold Every Year:**
  - Common keyway: Weiser, Baldwin
  - Over fifty years of diverse product lines:
    - Deadbolts
    - Rim
    - Lever handle
    - Electronic

#### Kwikset Distribution
- **Wide Product Line:**
  - Homes, apartments, business, commercial
- **Kwikset, Weiser, Baldwin: The Basics**
  - Pin tumbler and SmartKey
  - 5 or 6 pin conventional cylinders
  - Many configurations
  - 5 pin SmartKey programmable
  - Common keyways, no security
  - No duplication protection
  - Not high security
  - Mainly residential and apartments

#### Kwikset History
- **Original Pin Tumbler Design:**
  - Rim cylinder
  - Deadbolt
  - Key-in-knob design
- **Easily Compromised:**
  - Most popular until 2008
  - SmartKey introduced to Canada and the U.S. in 2008

#### Pin Tumbler vs. SmartKey
- **Pin Tumbler Design:**
  - Not secure
  - Easy to pick, bump, impression, and mechanically bypass
  - Can be master keyed
  - Limited number of combinations

- **How it Works:**
  - Pin stacks = security
  - Plug can turn when pins are at shearline
  - Locked: pins not at shearline

- **Kwikset SmartKey:**
  - Not a pin tumbler lock
  - Attributes:
    - 5 pin only, 6 depth increments
    - Single sidebar security
    - Extremely pick resistant (UL437)
    - Cannot be bumped or impressioned
    - Instant programmability to any key
    - Cannot be master keyed
  - Additional attributes:
    - One primary keyway
    - BHMA 156.5 Grade 1 rating
    - UL 437 rating
    - Special “Key Control Deadbolt” as an alternative to MK systems

#### Master Key Systems: Pin Tumbler vs. SmartKey
- **Conventional MK Systems:**
  - One key opens many locks
  - Different levels of keying
  - Expensive to rekey or add keys
  - Must disassemble cylinder to rekey
  - Cross keying between locks and systems

- **MK System Security:**
  - Inherent insecurity
  - Must have at least two security layers
  - Easier to compromise entire system
  - Multiple shear lines
  - Unintended key combinations will open the lock
  - Easier to pick, bump, impression, and decode
  - Extrapolation of TMK

#### Kwikset Key Control: The Alternative to Master Keying
- **Two Independent Cores:**
  - Two separate and distinct keys
  - Supposed to maintain security of key blanks
  - Control key only from factory
  - Instantly reprogrammable
  - No cross keying or incidental master keys
  - Not a real MK system
  - Only one level of keying

- **Positive Attributes:**
  - No locksmith required
  - 46,656 theoretical combinations
  - Good for facilities that need one MK level only
  - Great for construction MK
  - No disassembly of cylinders
  - Two independent shear lines with no interaction like conventional systems

- **More Positive Attributes:**
  - Instant ability to reprogram
  - Two separate keyways
  - Cannot derive control key from change key
  - Like Corbin “Master Sleeve” system 75 years ago, inherently more secure
  - Little chance of one system opening another

- **The Bad:**
  - No warranty for commercial use
  - Not for complex or commercial systems
  - Can be compromised in 15 seconds
  - Easy to decode control key
  - Easy to replicate control key
  - No patent protection on keys

#### Security: You Get What You Pay For
- **Do You Expect a $20-$30 Lock to Provide Any Security?**
  - Some buyers cannot afford higher security
  - What is the minimum they are entitled to?
  - Kwikset knows these locks have serious vulnerabilities
  - Does the public have a right to know how easy it is to open them?
  - Should there be warnings on packaging?

#### Kwikset SmartKey: Insecurity Engineering
- **Millions of People and Facilities at Potential Risk:**
  - Covert entry
  - Forced entry
  - Kwikset claims: “Highest grade of residential security available.”
  - True but misleading
  - Open in less than thirty seconds
  - False sense of security

- **BHMA Grade 1 Rating:**
  - “Highest grade of residential security”
  - UL 437 picking rating
  - Virtually bump proof
  - Users are not aware of risks
  - Locks can be opened in seconds
  - Failure to disclose vulnerabilities

#### Kwikset Advertising and Misrepresentations
- **False or Misleading Statements by Tech Support and Sales:**
  - 8 separate interviews:
    - “Cannot be opened except by drilling”
    - “No maintenance problems”
    - “Video on YouTube not true: lock was tampered with”
    - “No way can be opened with a screwdriver”
    - “The problem has been dealt with”

#### SmartKey Design Issues
- **Sidebar Should Provide More Security Than Pin Tumbler Lock:**
  - Only one layer of security
  - Small, fragile sliders
  - Programming problems
  - Low tolerance, limited differs
  - 243 key combinations
  - All the same blank
  - Cast metal easily compromised

- **More Design Issues:**
  - Plug design can be warped
  - Slider design
  - Able to decode the sliders
  - Sliders easily jammed
  - Tailpiece design and access
  - No key detent for programming

#### SmartKey: Methods of Defeat
- **Tryout Keys:**
  - Biting = 6 depths @.023”
  - 5 sliders
  - Universe of keys = 3^5 = 243
  - #1.5 = Depths 1-2
  - #3.5 = Depths 3-4
  - #5.5 = Depths 5-6

- **Depth Increments and Tolerance:**
  - Depths 1-2-3-4-5-6
  - Depth increments 1-2
  - Depths 1-2 = 1.5
  - Depth increments 3-4
  - Depths 3-4 = 3.5
  - Depth increments 5-6
  - Depths 5-6 = 5.5

- **Tailpiece Design:**
  - Same design for pin tumbler and SmartKey
  - Hollow and solid telescoping
  - Plug cap not sufficient
  - Zig-zag wire through keyway
    - No trace
    - No damage
    - Less than 30 seconds

- **Key-in-Knob Attack:**
  - Tailpiece access
  - Visual decoding sliders
  - Insert borescope or mirror to view position
  - Torque the plug
    - Believed to violate BHMA 156.5
    - Formal complaint filed
    - How the lock can be compromised:
      - Warp sliders or keyway
      - Application of 110 pound force inches
      - Set sliders to specific position
      - Apply torque with 4” screwdriver and wrench
      - Open in about fifteen seconds

- **Slider Design and Torque Attack:**
  - Torque and BHMA 156.5 requirement = 300 lbf-in
  - Open in 112 lbf-in
  - 112 pounds force inches = open
  - Key control: none

#### Summary: SmartKey Insecurity
- **One of the Most Popular and Inexpensive Locks in the U.S. and Canada:**
  - Consumer-friendly
  - Fills certain needs
  - Secure against certain attacks (picking, bumping)

- **Burglars: They Don’t Pick Locks:**
  - Pick-resistant
  - Bump-proof
  - All of the security is meaningless if the lock can be opened in 15 seconds
  - Patents mean nothing
  - BHMA ratings mean nothing
  - Could be made secure
  - You get what you pay for
