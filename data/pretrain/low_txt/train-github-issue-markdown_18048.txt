When editing Node.js (JavaScript) files after opening a folder, I encountered an issue with the "Go to Definition" feature. Specifically, when a file requires another module from the same folder, using F12 or right-clicking and selecting "Go to Definition" no longer works as of the latest update (Version 0.10.10). This feature was previously functioning correctly and is one that I use frequently.
