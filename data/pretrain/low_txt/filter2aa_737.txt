**Information Classification: General**

## Attacker’s View
- **Code goes in, apps come out**
- **Pipelines have network access to a range of environments**
- **Pipelines have credentials to pull dependencies and push artifacts**
- **Free compute resources**

## Scenarios

## Developer Access
- **Git Access**: 
  - Granted developer access to an internal Bitbucket repository
  - **Apache Maven Project**: Could modify project dependencies
  - **Hosted dependency on an attacker-controlled URL**
  - **Jenkins Runner Shell**: Meterpreter shell from Jenkins runner
  - **Limited environment means easy recon**: Found keys
  - **Pivot**: Network Recon – SSH, File system access – SSH key
  - **Root**: SSH access to Jenkins control nodes, Secrets for all projects, Kubeconfig file

## GitHub Authorization
- **GitHub Authorization Plugin**: "Grant READ Permissions to All Authenticated Users" (not "All Authenticated Users in this Organisation")
- **Jenkins Access with Gmail Account**: Register an arbitrary account in GitHub to log in, Log in to Jenkins, Access to build jobs and history, No monitoring and alerting

## Lessons Learned
- **Read the description and test**
- **Least privilege principle**
- **Separation of duties**
- **Monitoring and alerting**

## Build Output
- **Jenkins Login**: Authenticated Users had Overall/Administrator role in Jenkins
- **Infra as Code pipeline with terraform cli within the steps**: No monitoring and alerting
- **Job Logs**: Terraform CLI output in build output, Output did not mask any secrets, Showed all users AWS API keys

## FSAS Engagement
- **Entry**: Red team compromised a developer account, Git access to a range of repositories
- **Pipeline Access**: Pipeline modifications, Pipeline prevented displaying of env variables, `printenv | base64`
- **Credentials**: Service account with Domain Admin access

## Web Application LFI
- **Web App**: Internal infrastructure assessment, Identified web application SSRF/LFI vulnerabilities, Application was deployed for testing mid-pipeline
- **Kubernetes**: Read service account token through LFI, Use to communicate with Kubernetes API Server, Permissions to edit Configmaps (AWS EKS authentication), Gained cluster admin on the build cluster
- **Container Registry**: Stole AWS IAM credentials to deploy to ECR
- **Kubernetes**: Production workloads used pull-based CI, Overwrote images in ECR, new images were automatically pulled

## From Cloud Web App to On-Prem Server
- **Web App**: Started with WordPress with some custom pages, Application had directory listings enabled, S3 bucket linked as sitemap, File responsible to push code to GitHub
- **Git**: File had hardcoded credentials in S3 allowed access to VCS, Developer access to multiple repositories with read and write, No alert on signing in with the account, but had logs
- **Jenkins**: Same credentials allowed access to Jenkins, as an administrator, 14 clusters with 200 build servers or agents
- **Lateral Movement**: Cluster admin on 14 Jenkins Masters and 200 Jenkins build servers, Dump credentials from Jenkins: 200+ API Tokens, SSH Keys

## Branched-Based Secrets
- **Developer Access**: Developers had no direct access to production cloud environments, Only main branch deployed to prod, Main branch protected, and required merge approval
- **Circle CI**: Pipelines configured using CircleCI YAML files, Configuration files in the same repo as application code, Secrets specified per branch
- **Privilege Escalation**: Developers could modify pipeline configuration file in non-Main branches

## Lessons Learned
- **Validate secret management/protection**
- **Assume every developer is malicious (or trust them)**
- **Log and audit credential use**
- **Least privilege RBAC**

## Privilege Escalation
- **SSO Credentials**: Login with SSO Credentials, Testing 3 separated roles: read, build, admin, Locked down and documented roles
- **Privilege Escalation**: Build user with Build/Replay permission, Code execution with Groovy, Credentials dump

## Conclusion
- **CI/CD is beneficial, but also complex**
- **None of these problems are new**
- **Environments are rarely threat modeled**
- **Little focus on the pipeline and infrastructure**
