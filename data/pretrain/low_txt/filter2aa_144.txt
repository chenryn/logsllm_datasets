### 5. Key Terms
- **IPC (Inter-Process Communication)**
  - **Definition:** An operating system mechanism that allows processes and applications to manage shared data and communicate.
  - **Roles:** Categorized as clients and servers, where the client requests data and the server responds.
  - **Usage:** Many applications are both clients and servers, common in distributed computing.

- **Windows Named Pipes**
  - **Definition:** A method for IPC in Microsoft Windows.
  - **Communication:** One-way or duplex pipe between the pipe server and one or more pipe clients.
  - **File System:** Utilizes NPFS (Named Pipe Filesystem).
  - **Access:** Any process can access named pipes, subject to security checks.
  - **Instances:** All instances share the same pipe name but have their own buffers and handles.
  - **Configurations:**
    - Half Duplex or Full Duplex
    - Byte-Oriented or Packet-Oriented
    - Local or Network
  - **Network Communication:** Not encrypted, uses SMB (port 445) or DCE/RPC (port 135).

- **RPC (Remote Procedure Call)**
  - **Definition:** A protocol that allows one program to invoke a service from a program located on another computer.
  - **Details:** No need to understand the network's structure; uses port 135 TCP or UDP.

- **DCE/RPC (Distributed Computing Environment / Remote Procedure Calls)**
  - **Definition:** A facility for calling a procedure on a remote machine as if it were a local procedure call.
  - **Programming:** To the programmer, a remote call looks like a local call.

- **SMB (Server Message Block)**
  - **Definition:** An application-layer network protocol providing shared access to files, printers, serial ports, etc.
  - **Usage:** Mostly used for file sharing.
  - **Examples:**
    - `\\192.168.1.1\c$\Users\manager\Documents`
    - `\\fileserver\public\shareddocs`
  - **Features:** Provides authenticated inter-process communication, uses port 445 TCP.

- **Named and Unnamed (Anonymous) Pipes**
  - **Types:**
    - **Named Pipes:** Have a specific name, all instances share the name.
    - **Unnamed/Anonymous Pipes:** Not given a name, used only for communication between a child and its parent process, always local, vanishes when closed or when one of the processes completes execution.

### 6. Connecting to a Named Pipe
- **Location:** All pipes placed in the root directory of NPFS.
- **Mounting:** Cannot be mounted within the normal filesystem, mounted under the special path `\\.\pipe\{pipe name}`.
- **Example:**
  - A pipe named "foo" would have a full path name of: `\\.\pipe\foo`.
  - Remote connection: `\\10.0.0.1\pipe\foo`.
- **Tools:**
  - **IO Ninja:** A Swiss army knife for named pipes and other communications.
  - **Wireshark:** For monitoring SMB communication.

### 7. Pipe ACLs and Connection Limitation
- **Implementation:** Named pipes are implemented by a filesystem driver in Windows NT, `npfs.sys`, which supports security descriptors.
- **Security Descriptors:** Used to control access to named pipes.
- **Default Permissions:** DACL (Discretionary Access Control Lists) permissions set to everyone using anonymous login (null sessions).
- **Other Configurations:** Some named pipes allow access to authenticated domain users.
- **Modification:** ACLs can be modified to allow only specific users.
- **Limitations:** Maximum number of instances of a pipe.

### 8. Named Pipes in the Wild
- **Conficker Case Study:**
  - **Overview:** A computer worm targeting Microsoft Windows, first detected in November 2008.
  - **Propagation:** Uses flaws in Windows OS software and dictionary attacks on administrator passwords.
  - **Impact:** Infected millions of computers in over 190 countries.
  - **Variant C:** Creates a named pipe to push URLs for downloadable payloads to other infected hosts on a local area network.
  - **Usage:** Used in other Trojans like Moker, ZxShell, and Petya for transferring extracted passwords.

### 9. Enumerating and Scanning for Named Pipes
- **Tools:**
  - **Sysinternals’ pipelist:** For locally detecting open named pipes.
  - **Beyond Security Pipe Security Editor:** For enumerating named pipes ACLs.
  - **SysInternals’ pipeacl:** For viewing permissions of named pipes.
  - **Metasploit Module (Pipe_Auditor):** For remotely enumerating accessible named pipes over SMB or RPC.

### 10. Sniffing Named Pipes Content
- **Tools:**
  - **IO Ninja:** Enables sniffing and monitoring traffic of a chosen named pipe.

### 11. Fuzzing Named Pipes
- **Definition:** An automated software testing technique involving invalid, unexpected, or random data inputs.
- **Tools:**
  - **Dump-fuzzing script:** Available for Windows IPC fuzzing.
- **Approaches:**
  - **Dumb (Black Box):** Goes over all possible inputs without understanding the expected ones.
  - **Smart (White Box):** Understands the expected input and fuzzes along the edges.

### 12. Exploitation and Impact
- **Vulnerabilities:**
  - **Hidden and Undocumented APIs:** Many pieces of software work with these, leaving named pipes as an uncharted territory.
  - **App and Infra PT:** Named pipes fall between application and infrastructure pentesting, often overlooked.
  - **Risks:** If software reads data from the named pipe without validation, it can lead to buffer overflow, denial of service, or remote code execution.
  - **Remote Access:** If named pipe ACLs allow remote access, remote DoS or RCE can be triggered.
  - **Zero Day Vulnerabilities:** Research into crash causes can facilitate zero-day vulnerabilities.
  - **Malware Spread:** Can be used to spread malware, as seen in WannaCry and NotPetya campaigns.

### 13. Case Study: Viber, qBittorrent, SugarSync
- **Viber:**
  - **Description:** Cellular and endpoint social communication, free calls, text, and picture sharing.
  - **Users:** 800 million worldwide.
- **qBittorrent:**
  - **Description:** Cross-platform BitTorrent client, free and open-source, written in C++.
- **SugarSync:**
  - **Description:** Cloud service for file synchronization and backup across various devices.
- **Common Framework:** QT framework, used for cross-platform application development.
- **Vulnerability:** By fuzzing the named pipe, remote crashes and command injection attacks were achieved.

### 14. Mitigation and Defense
- **Developers:**
  - **Secure ACLs:** Set secured ACLs to allow only authorized connections.
  - **Least Privilege:** Follow the least privilege approach.
  - **Instance Limitation:** Limit the maximum number of instances of a named pipe.
- **Users/3rd Party Software Clients:**
  - **Block Services:** Block unnecessary SMB and RPC services (ports 135 and 445), especially over WAN/Internet.
  - **Network Segmentation:** Segment the network according to security best practices.
  - **Patches:** Install the latest software security patches.
- **Hackers:**
  - **Explore Opportunities:** Explore remotely accessible named pipes and test for RCE and DoS.
  - **Have Fun:** Enjoy the process!

### 15. Closing Remarks
- **Importance:** Windows named pipes are a forgotten, remotely accessible, socket-like interface.
- **Potential Risks:** A newly rediscovered potential world of local and remote vulnerabilities.
- **Advice:** Do not ignore named pipes in Windows desktop applications.
- **Stay Safe:** Stay vigilant and secure.
