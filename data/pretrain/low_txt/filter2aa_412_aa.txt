### New in This Presentation:
- **Hostile Portal Attacks:** Steal Active Directory credentials from WPA2-EAP networks without network access.
- **Indirect Wireless Pivots:** Use Rogue AP attacks to bypass port-based access control mechanisms.

## WPA2-EAP and Wireless Theory

### Evil Twin Attacks
- **Rogue Access Point (AP) Attacks:**
  - Core component of modern wireless penetration tests.
  - Enable stealthy Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
  - Facilitate the theft of RADIUS credentials and use of captive portals.

### Evolution of Rogue Access Point Attacks
- **2002:** Evil Twin attacks documented in “Wireless LAN Security FAQ” by C. W. Klaus.
- **2003:** asleap by Joshua Wright.
- **2004:** Karma Attacks by Dino Dai Zovi and Shane Macaulay.
- **2008:** Freeradius-wpe by Joshua Wright and Brad Antoniewitz.
- **2014:** Improved Karma Attacks (Mana) by Dominic White and Ian de Villiers.
- **2017:** Lure10 Attacks by George Chatzisofroniou.

### Roles of Rogue AP Attacks
- **Primary Uses:**
  1. MITM attacks (stealing credentials).
  2. Breaching WPA/WPA2 networks (gaining access to WLAN).
- **New Role:** As a means of lateral movement.

### Evil Twin Attacks Against WPA2-EAP
- **Authentication Process:**
  - Occurs between the supplicant and the authentication server.
- **EAP Vulnerabilities:**
  - Without a secure tunnel, the authentication process can be sniffed.
  - Legacy EAP implementations (e.g., EAP-MD5) are susceptible to offline password derivation.

### Attack Techniques
- **freeradius-wpe (2008):** Forces the supplicant to authenticate with the attacker using an evil twin attack.
- **Cracking MS-CHAPv2:**
  - **Dictionary Attack:** Success rate inversely proportional to password strength.
  - **Divide and Conquer Attack (2012):** Exploits the 56-bit DES encryption used in MS-CHAPv2, allowing for 100% success rate in less than 24 hours with FPGA cracking rigs like Crack.sh.

### Solution: EAP-TLS
- **Introduction (2008):** RFC 5216.
- **Features:**
  - Mutual authentication using x.509 certificates.
  - Strength lies in client-side certificates.
- **Challenges:**
  - Poor adoption due to perceived complexity.
  - Classic security vs. convenience dilemma.

## Network Access Control (NAC) Mechanisms

### Traditional NAC
- **Purpose:**
  - Distinguish between authorized and unauthorized network endpoints.
  - Place unauthorized devices in a quarantine VLAN.
- **Types:**
  - **Agent-based NAC:**
    - Installed on authorized endpoints.
    - Highly effective but impractical.
  - **Agentless NAC:**
    - Uses passive fingerprinting and active scanning.
    - Easier to deploy but can be bypassed by masquerading as an authorized device.

### Next-Generation NAC
- **Features:**
  - Uses WMI to interrogate new devices.
  - Performs internal checks without an agent.
  - Authenticates over SMB using a single administrative service account.
  - Allows deep interrogation without additional overhead.
- **Single Point of Failure:**
  - Service account has extensive network access, creating a significant risk.

### SMB Relay Attacks
- **NTLM Authentication Process:**
  - Client attempts to authenticate.
  - Server issues a challenge.
  - Client encrypts the challenge using its password hash.
  - Client sends the encrypted challenge back to the server.
  - Server decrypts the response.
  - If decrypted response matches the challenge, authentication succeeds.
- **SMB Relay Attack:**
  - Attacker intercepts NTLM traffic.
  - Relays the authentication attempt to the target server.
  - Attacker is authenticated with the server.

### Mitigations
- **SMB Signing:** Digitally signs packets to confirm their authenticity.
- **Challenges:**
  - Does not address the issue of hashes being sent to untrusted endpoints.
  - Requires installation, essentially acting as an agent.

### Wireless Client Isolation
- **Purpose:**
  - Prevents wireless clients from communicating with each other.
  - Commonly used in open networks.
- **Theoretical Function:**
  - AP mediates all communication.
- **Practical Limitations:**
  - Logical control, not physical.
  - Radio transceivers cannot be prevented from communicating with each other.

### Tools and Techniques
- **Wifitap:**
  - First released by Cedric Blancher in 2005.
  - Revived by Oliver Lavery in 2013.
  - Reads packets from the victim to the AP in monitor mode.
  - Injects responses as if they came from the AP.
- **Aircrack Suite:**
  - **airtun-ng:** Supports WEP.
  - **tkiptun-ng:** Supports WPA1.

### Theoretical Attacks
- **Hole 196:** Debated effectiveness but worth mentioning.

### Conclusion
- **NAC's Role:**
  - Used to prevent attackers from accessing sensitive resources after a breach.
- **Actions:**
  - Place unauthorized endpoints in quarantine.
  - Block the port.
- **Final Thoughts:**
  - NAC is not the only problem in wireless security.
  - A balanced approach is needed to address both security and convenience.
