**Abstract:**
In distributed systems, users need the ability to share sensitive content with multiple recipients based on their ability to satisfy arbitrary policies. One such system is the electricity grid, where fine-grained sensor data sharing holds the potential for increased reliability and efficiency. However, effective data sharing requires technical solutions that support flexible access policies, such as sharing more data when the grid is unstable. In such systems, both the messages and policies are sensitive and need to be kept secret. Furthermore, to allow for secure and usable data sharing in the presence of untrusted object stores and relays, the system must be resilient to active adversaries and provide efficient key management. While several of these properties have been studied in the past, we address a new problem in the area of policy-based encryption by developing a solution with all of these capabilities. We develop a Policy and Key Encapsulation Mechanism - Data Encapsulation Mechanism (PKEM-DEM) encryption scheme that is secure against adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks and use this scheme to create a Policy-Based Encryption System (PBES) that provides these capabilities. We provide an implementation of PBES and measure its performance.

## 1. Introduction
In distributed systems, users need to share sensitive objects with others based on the recipients' ability to satisfy a policy. In this work, we develop a Policy-Based Encryption System (PBES) driven by a real-world, large-scale, policy-based data sharing problem. The problem we address is data sharing in the electric power grid, where power system operators need to cooperate to operate the grid safely and reliably but also compete as business entities. Increasing power consumption and major events, such as the August 2003 blackout, mean that system operators are compelled to share sensitive data to improve grid reliability through wide-area measurement, monitoring, and control. In deregulated grids, utilities share sensitive data with local Independent System Operators (ISOs) as required by regulatory laws. However, they may not be comfortable disclosing sensitive data to other entities except under certain conditions, such as transient conditions in the grid at the time of access. For example, Utility A might be willing to share certain data:
1. With some utilities immediately, while with others only after four hours.
2. With any Utility X under the jurisdiction of ISO B during a frequency or voltage disturbance.

In many cases, it is the context-based policy that drives data sharing, and the number or identities of recipients may not be known in advance. Both the data and the policies are sensitive. For instance, if a policy rule involving a major transmission disturbance were in clear text, observing significant network traffic with that policy could reveal that a major event has occurred, leading to negative publicity, loss of market revenue, or increased attacks.

An effective approach for addressing the power grid data sharing problem requires techniques that go beyond today's solutions. Specifically, there is a need for policy-based data encryption techniques that support:
1. Multiple recipients.
2. Data and policy secrecy.
3. Context-based policy enforcement.

Furthermore, to be practical, these techniques must be efficient in terms of key management, support flexible policy specifications, be secure in the presence of active adversaries, and be compatible with existing distributed networking and systems technologies. Past work in this area has addressed only a subset of these problems. Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) systems and policy-based cryptographic schemes allow the association of flexible policies with objects but do not keep the policy secret and are designed for two-party communication. Works in the area of "hidden policies and credentials" provide message and policy secrecy but focus on two-party interactions. Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) systems such as Ciphertext-Policy ABE (CP-ABE) and policy-based cryptographic schemes allow the association of flexible policies with objects for multiple recipients but do not provide policy secrecy and are vulnerable to collusion attacks. Recent work extends CP-ABE to support policy secrecy but limits policy flexibility and does not support context-based policies. PEAPOD focuses on one-to-many messaging with both message and policy secrecy but does not provide efficient key management and is also vulnerable to collusion attacks.

### Our Contribution
In this work, we develop an application-independent Policy-Based Encryption System (PBES) that addresses the new problem of providing all the above-mentioned properties and then use the solution to design an effective power grid data sharing application. We build a new encryption scheme, PKEM-DEM (Policy and Key Encapsulation Mechanism - Data Encapsulation Mechanism), for encrypting objects and policies and show that it is secure against adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks in the random oracle model. The encryption scheme builds on recent work in KEM-DEM hybrid encryption schemes. In addition to message indistinguishability and policy indistinguishability, we define and prove a new notion of pairwise indistinguishability, where adversaries need to distinguish between pairs of messages and policies. We then use this scheme to construct the PBES system that provides the three properties mentioned above. For decryption, PBES utilizes trusted Key Distribution Centers (KDCs) that mediate decryption of objects for recipients and enforce the policies associated with the objects. We leverage the KDCs for policy enforcement and provide very efficient key management as well as immediate revocation. We discuss how PBES can address the requirements of the power grid data sharing application and study design issues for developing applications in general, such as key distribution and placement of trust in KDCs. We also implement a prototype toolkit to demonstrate its feasibility and reasonable performance.

PBES employs trusted key servers, which is reasonable for regulated environments such as the power grid. From a systems perspective, this approach initially seemed straightforward, but it turned out to be challenging. We examined leading Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and secure publish/subscribe systems that typically employ trusted servers for mediated access control but were unable to satisfy the requirements. Specifically, the requirements for policy secrecy and context-based policy enforcement could not be met. PBES satisfies these requirements and also provides efficiency, security, and flexibility. We show that with its unique properties, PBES can naturally address the data sharing needs of the power grid. To that end, we identify actors, applications, and processes for data sharing in the grid. While we focus primarily on the power grid, PBES is suitable for many large-scale systems that share features with the power grid, such as medical and financial information systems. Regulated environments often employ trusted mediators, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in public health and the Securities and Exchange Commission in finance. Even outside regulated domains, suitable application domains include those where partial trust or auditing capabilities are provided by the trusted servers.

## 2. Background
The North American electric power grid is a highly interconnected system, hailed as one of the greatest engineering feats of the 20th century. However, increasing demand for electricity and an aging infrastructure are putting pressure on the reliability and safety of the grid, as witnessed in recent blackouts. Deregulation of the power industry has moved it from vertically integrated centralized operations to coordinated decentralized operations. Reliability Coordinators (RCs) such as Independent System Operators (ISOs) or Regional Transmission Operators (RTOs) are tasked with overseeing reliable operation of the grid and providing reliability coordination and oversight over a wide area. Balancing Authorities (BAs) are responsible for balancing load, generation, and scheduled interchange in real-time within a given Balancing Authority Area (BAA). BAA is a geographic area where a single entity balances generation and loads in real-time to maintain reliable operation. Every generator, transmission facility, and end-use customer is in a BAA.

Currently, sensor readings from substations in utilities are sent via a communication network to the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems in the local BA that controls the system and to the RC that oversees reliable operation. There are operations taking place at various time granularities to keep the power system stable and reliable. Among the frequent operations, protection and control mechanisms at substations operate at the granularity of milliseconds, state estimators and contingency analysis in BAs and RCs operate at the granularity of minutes and hours, and hourly and day-ahead power markets run by RCs operate at the granularity of hour and day, respectively.

To improve the reliability of the power grid while meeting increased power demand, the industry is moving towards wide-area measurement, monitoring, and control. The Department of Energy (DOE), NERC, and electric utility companies formed the North American SynchroPhasor Initiative (NASPI) with a vision to improve the reliability of the power grid through wide-area measurement, monitoring, and control. Its mission is to create a robust, widely available, and secure synchronized data measurement infrastructure with associated monitoring and analysis tools for better planning and reliable operation of the power grid. NASPI envisions the deployment of hundreds of thousands of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) across the grid, pumping data at 30 samples/second to hundreds of applications in approximately 140 BAAs across the country. PMUs are clock-synchronized (through GPS) sensors that can read current and voltage phasors at a substation bus on the transmission power network. Phasor Data Concentrators (PDCs) at substations or control centers time-align the data from multiple PMUs before sending them to applications. PMUs give direct access to the state of the grid at any given instant, in contrast to having to estimate the state, as is done today. Figure 1 shows a high-level architecture envisioned for PMUs. Applications utilizing this data have varying requirements. Open-loop control applications like state estimation have critical time alignment requirements, while post-event analysis applications like disturbance analysis have critical accuracy and message rate requirements. Feedback control applications like transient stability control have critical latency, availability, accuracy, message rate, and time alignment requirements.

While utilities are currently mandated to share operational data with their local BA and RC (ISO or RTO), they are not required or expected to share data with other utilities. This is because, while the utilities have to cooperate to operate the grid safely and reliably, they are also business competitors. Furthermore, this data can reveal a fine-grained view of a utility's network and the current state of that network. In the wrong hands, the former can make the utility a target of attacks, and the latter can affect the wholesale electricity markets and, consequently, the utility itself adversely. Another consideration hampering data sharing is the concern of utilities that they might open themselves up for continuous compliance monitoring. However, there is mutual benefit in sharing PMU data widely, as it will help in operating the grid safely and reliably and in avoiding overloading, outages, brownouts, and blackouts. Sharing PMU data will also help in:

- Improving the overall reliability and stability of the grid.
- Enabling better coordination and response to grid disturbances.
- Enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of grid operations.

By addressing the challenges and requirements of data sharing in the power grid, PBES provides a robust and secure solution that can be extended to other large-scale, regulated environments.
