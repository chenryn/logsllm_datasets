# Intrusion Detection and Attacker Identification in In-Vehicle Networks

## Abstract
This paper presents an LOF (Local Outlier Factor)-based intrusion detection method for identifying attackers in in-vehicle networks. We conducted three types of attacks—physical, remote, and bus-off—on two vehicles, a Luxgen U5 SUV and a Buick Regal. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately distinguish between normal and attack signals, with high detection rates and low false detection rates. 

## 1. Introduction
In-vehicle networks, such as the CAN (Controller Area Network) bus, are critical for the operation of modern vehicles. However, they are also vulnerable to various types of attacks. This paper proposes an LOF-based intrusion detection method to identify and mitigate these attacks.

## 2. Experimental Setup
### A. Experimental Environment
We conducted experiments on two vehicles: a 2017 Luxgen U5 SUV and a 2017 Buick Regal. The CAN bus was accessed via the OBD II interface, using pins 6 and 14 for CAN-H and CAN-L lines, respectively. The experimental setup included:
- **PicoScope 2204A**: A portable oscilloscope for measuring and recording CAN bus voltage.
- **CANalyst II**: For sending camouflaged CAN frames to the vehicles.
- **CANWIFI II**: For performing remote wireless attacks up to 30 meters away.

### B. Spoofing Attack and Detection
We performed reverse engineering on the CAN bus traffic and executed a spoofing attack by sending camouflaged data to control vehicle functions like lights and wipers. The CAN bus voltage was simultaneously recorded. Since different devices generate unique voltage waveforms, our LOF-based scheme can accurately detect these anomalies.

### C. Bus-off Attack and Detection
The CAN bus arbitration mechanism ensures that only one ECU (Electronic Control Unit) transmits at a time. However, a bus-off attack can force multiple ECUs to transmit simultaneously, leading to bit errors and disconnection from the bus. Our experiments reconstructed this attack to verify the effectiveness of our intrusion detection method.

## 3. Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
LOF is a distance-based anomaly detection method used in various fields, including anti-cheating and attack defense. It assigns a dispersion value to each point based on its local density. Points with lower local densities are considered outliers. The LOF value for a point \( p \) is given by:

\[
\text{LOF}_k(p) = \frac{\sum_{o \in N_k(p)} \text{lrd}_k(o)}{|N_k(p)|} / \text{lrd}_k(p)
\]

where \( \text{lrd}_k(p) \) is the local reachable density:

\[
\text{lrd}_k(p) = \frac{1}{\sum_{o \in N_k(p)} \max(d_k(o), d(p, o)) / |N_k(p)|}
\]

Here, \( N_k(p) \) is the set of \( k \) nearest neighbors of \( p \), \( d_k(o) \) is the distance to the \( k \)-th nearest neighbor of \( o \), and \( d(p, o) \) is the distance between \( p \) and \( o \).

## 4. Experimental Results and Analysis
### A. Attacker Identification
Our method successfully identified ECUs in both the Luxgen and Buick cars. For the Luxgen, 4 out of 12 ECUs were perfectly identified, with the rest having identification rates of 96% or higher. The false detection rate was very low, with only 0.5% of ECU3's signal being misidentified as ECU2's. For the Buick, 3 out of 13 ECUs were perfectly identified, with the rest having identification rates above 98%, except for ECU4. Only ECU10 had a false detection rate of 1%.

### B. Intrusion Detection
The proposed LOF-based method accurately distinguished between normal and attack signals, with over 97% of signals correctly identified. The detection rate for bus-off attacks was over 90%. In comparison, the SVM (Support Vector Machine) algorithm achieved an average detection rate of 87.9% and a false detection rate of 3.77%, with the highest false detection rate being 17.5%.

## 5. Conclusion
The LOF-based intrusion detection method effectively identifies attackers and distinguishes between normal and attack signals in in-vehicle networks. Future work will focus on implementing a complete intrusion detection system with more attack models and efficient algorithms.
