### A Decade of Experience with Research Proposals and Query Languages for the Web

Over the past decade, extensive experience with research proposals and standardized query languages for both the conventional Web and the emerging Semantic Web has highlighted the need to reconsider the design principles for these query languages. This paper argues that a new generation of versatile Web query languages is essential to address the challenges posed by the evolving Web. It also emphasizes that well-known referential transparency and novel answer-closedness are critical features of such versatile query languages.

The decentralized and heterogeneous nature of the Web necessitates the handling of incomplete data specifications and selections. This means that queries can be specified without precise knowledge of the queried data, and answers can be limited to an excerpt of the queried data.

### A Layered Model for Building Ontology Translation Systems

**Authors:**
- Oscar Corcho, Intelligent Software Components, Spain
- Asunción Gómez-Pérez, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Spain

In this paper, the authors present a model for building ontology translation systems between different ontology languages and tools. The model defines translation decisions at four distinct layers: lexical, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic. The authors also propose a method to guide the development of ontology translation systems, which includes four main activities: feasibility study, analysis of source and target formats, design, and implementation. Each activity is broken down into specific tasks, and the authors recommend appropriate techniques for each task.

### A Survey on Ontology Creation Methodologies

**Authors:**
- Matteo Cristani and Roberta Cuel, Università di Verona, Italy

This paper provides a framework for analyzing existing methodologies for ontology creation by comparing them against a set of general criteria. The authors classify these methodologies based on the direction of ontology construction: bottom-up approaches start with domain descriptions and derive a classification, while top-down approaches begin with an abstract view of the domain. This classification is valuable not only for theoretical purposes but also for practical applications in Information Systems, as it helps in selecting the appropriate methodology based on the specific context and application needs.

### MTSR'05: First Online Conference on Metadata and Semantics Research

**Website:**
[http://www.metadata-semantics.org](http://www.metadata-semantics.org)

**Latest News:**
Selected papers will be considered for journal special issues. More information is available in the call for papers section.

**Conference Overview:**
The First Online Conference on Metadata and Semantics Research (MTSR'05) aims to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in metadata, its representation, semantics, and diverse applications in Information Systems. The conference focuses on four interconnected research areas: Semantic Web and Information Systems, Reusable Learning Objects, Knowledge Management in Information Systems, and Cultural Heritage Metadata. Other "metadata and semantics"-related topics are also of interest.

**Format:**
The online format encourages the demonstration of systems and prototypes and enables the sharing of artifacts like schemas, ontologies, learning objects, or sample metadata records. The conference will publish online pre-proceedings to facilitate virtual interaction and discussion. Post-proceedings, including all presented papers and extended versions incorporating discussion results, will be published by an international editor. Best papers will be selected for publishing extended versions in several International Journals covering the diversity of topics of the conference.

**Sponsorship:**
MTSR'05 is sponsored by AIS SIGSEMIS and AIS SIGRLO. Members will benefit from reduced registration fees.

**Call for Papers:**
The conference focuses on the following areas:
- Semantic Web (SW) applications to Information Systems.
- Learning Objects (LO) concepts and applications.
- Knowledge Management (KM) approaches to Information Systems.
- Cultural Heritage (CH) issues, schemas, and applications.

Selected papers will be considered for inclusion in topical special issues in The Electronic Library and Online Information.
