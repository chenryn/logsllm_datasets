### Observability of Different Measurement Signals

After applying the POD (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller to the system, the dominant eigenvalues for each input signal are listed in Table IV. The results indicate that all input signals have the potential to improve power system stability, making them viable candidates for the POD controller.

### Damping Performance of Each Signal

The damping performance of each signal is illustrated in Figure 7. As shown, using the power flow at bus 8 as the input provides the best control performance. The priority order of the input signals to the POD controller is determined as follows (from high to low priority): 7BP, 9BP, 8BP, and 6BusV. Voltage signals (BusV10) are excluded from the candidate list for the POD controller, and the three power flow signals are selected as the input signals.

### Stateful Data Delivery Service (SDDS) for POD Controller

A SDDS-based POD controller, referred to as the State Aware POD (SAPOD) controller, is introduced in this section. The SAPOD enables the controller to switch between different input data based on state provider (SP) information on link latency and select the appropriate signal input for the POD controller, as described in Section III.

### Experiment Setup

The power system, SAPOD controller, and SP are modeled in SIMULINK. The SP identifies the real-time latency of each input signal and selects the signal with the highest priority that meets the latency requirements listed in Table V. Only the chosen signal output is used to obtain the SAPOD output signal. It should be noted that the SP may take some processing time to switch from one input signal to another, introducing a switching latency of 1 second in the model.

### Results

In the experiment, the latency of the power flow signal from bus 8 remains at 0.2 seconds until 103 seconds of simulation, after which it increases to 0.5 seconds. The latency of the power flow signal from bus 7 remains at 0.4 seconds throughout the simulation. Two communication latency scenarios, 200 ms and 500 ms, were tested without the SDDS, using only the 8BP signal. The results, shown in the upper and lower halves of Figure 10, respectively, indicate that the power system is stable when the input signal has a latency of 200 ms but becomes unstable when the latency is 500 ms, causing the simulation to stop at 115.7 seconds due to a generator losing synchronization.

When using the SAPOD and SP, the results are presented in Figure 11. The latency of signal 8BP increases from 200 ms to 500 ms at 103 seconds, while the latency of signal 7BP remains at 400 ms. According to Table V, signal 8BP no longer meets the QoS requirement after 103 seconds, so the SP switches the input signal of the SAPOD from 8BP to 7BP at 104 seconds (including a 1-second switching delay). The power flow measured at bus 9 shows that the system is well damped by the SAPOD, unlike the instability observed in the first case without SDDS.

### Conclusion and Future Work

This paper presents a Stateful Data Delivery Service (SDDS) for power system applications. The SDDS uses real-time data link performance information to provide power system applications with data according to their QoS requirements. The study demonstrates the interaction between the SP and a power system application, using a POD controller as an example. The results show that the SDDS can enhance the reliability of application performance compared to systems without data link state awareness. The success of the SDDS suggests a new approach to designing power system applications, allowing for the use of multiple input signals to increase tolerance to latency issues, data source failures, and data link failures.
