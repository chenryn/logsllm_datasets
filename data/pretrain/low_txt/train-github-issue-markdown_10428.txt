### Current Behavior

When navigating to a route with multiple search parameters that share the same key, Angular merges them into a single parameter, retaining only the value of the last occurrence. For example:

- Navigating to `host.com/test?p=test&p=best` 
- Results in `host.com/test?p=best` after Angular has processed the URL.

### Expected Behavior

Navigating to `host.com/test?p=test&p=best` should result in the URL remaining as `host.com/test?p=test&p=best` after Angular has loaded.

### Minimal Reproduction

1. **Steps to Reproduce:**
   - Set up routing in an Angular application.
   - Navigate to a route with more than one search parameter that shares the same key.

2. **Plunker Example:**
   - A Plunker demonstrating the issue can be found [here](<plunker_link>). Open it in full screen and click on the "Click Me" button to see the behavior.

### Motivation / Use Case

The REST endpoint I am using for filtering and faceting adds multiple search parameters with the same key when more than one filter is selected. With the current behavior, only the last selected filter is retained, as all parameters with the same key are merged. This limits the functionality, as users can only select one filter per type. It seems unnecessary to merge these parameters, as they are intended to represent multiple values.

### Environment

- **Operating System:** macOS El Capitan 10.11.6
- **Development Tools:** Brackets, Webpack, NG Live Development Server
