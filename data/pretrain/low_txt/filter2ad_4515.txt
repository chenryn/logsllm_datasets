## Abstract
Attack trees are a widely used graphical notation for representing threats to IT systems. They allow the description of attacks in terms of attacker goals and actions. By focusing on a single attacker's perspective and a specific goal, the conceptual complexity of threat modeling is significantly reduced [1]. Aspects not covered by attack trees, such as the system's behavior under attack, can be described using other models, enabling a comprehensive security analysis.

Despite the long-standing popularity of attack trees in security engineering, some pitfalls in their use have only recently been identified [2]. In this talk, I will highlight these challenges, discuss how attack trees can be integrated with system models, and explain the implications of different model combinations for security analysis results. After analyzing an abstract model, the insights gained need to be applied to real-world scenarios. I will introduce an automata-based model for runtime monitors [3] and demonstrate how defenses can be implemented at runtime using the CliSeAu system [4,5].

## Biography
Heiko Mantel is a full professor of Computer Science at TU Darmstadt. His research interests include language-based security, security engineering, information-flow security, and side-channel analysis. From 2010 to 2017, he was the spokesperson for the national research initiative "Reliably Secure Software Systems," funded by the German Science Foundation. Since 2018, he has led the "Software-Factory 4.0" initiative, which aims to develop efficient, flexible, and reliable solutions for software re-engineering, funded by the state of Hesse. He has been involved in numerous research projects as a principal investigator.

Previously, Heiko Mantel was an assistant professor at RWTH Aachen, a postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zurich, and a researcher at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence. He received his Ph.D. from Saarland University in 2003.
