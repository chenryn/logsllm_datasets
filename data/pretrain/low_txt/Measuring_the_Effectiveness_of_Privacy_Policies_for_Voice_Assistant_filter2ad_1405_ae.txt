| Do you think all skills should have a privacy policy? | A privacy policy is always necessary to give users peace of mind. Users should be able to know the risks involved, such as if others could be listening in illegally. <br> <br> A privacy policy is definitely required so it can assure consumers that it is unlikely that malicious actions will occur with their data. They should be made easily accessible too. <br> <br> Required if there are things that customers should be warned about prior to using it. <br> <br> A privacy policy would be completely necessary. I feel like the skills need to disclose everything being done with a user’s data. But it should be easily explained and controls easily learned. <br> <br> If data is being collected, this is personal information that the user should have some control over. It needs to be more digestible so people will actually read it. <br> <br> I do think it is necessary to have a privacy policy, but I do think it should be short and easy to understand. |
