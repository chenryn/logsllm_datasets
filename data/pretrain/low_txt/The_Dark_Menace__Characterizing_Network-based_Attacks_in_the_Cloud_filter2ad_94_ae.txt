### Bound Attacks on Cloud Services

Bound attacks primarily target services in large cloud environments. The most common types of these attacks are SQL injection and TDS (Traffic Distribution System) attacks. Small ISPs and customer networks experience 25% and 13% of the outbound attacks, respectively (Figure 15a). However, individual Autonomous Systems (ASes) generate a negligible amount of outbound attacks, contributing less than 0.01% of the total (Figure 15b).

Small ISPs and customer networks are also the primary targets for brute-force attacks and spam. This is likely due to their often weaker security measures. For instance, 23.6% of the outbound DNS reflection attack packets are directed at an ISP in France. Therefore, it is crucial to coordinate security measures across cloud infrastructures and these networks to protect against such attacks.

Mobile networks face only a small number of brute-force attacks (1.4%). This may be because mobile devices are often behind NAT (Network Address Translation), which prevents unsolicited connections, making it harder for attacks to succeed.

### Internet Applications Under Attack

To understand the internet applications targeted by attacks, we analyzed the destination ports of outbound traffic from VIPs (Virtual IP addresses) generating outbound attacks (Figure 16). We found that the majority of outbound attacks target web services, with HTTP/HTTPS combined accounting for 64.5% of the attack VIPs. For example, 69% of the outbound UDP floods use port 80, targeting HTTP services. Other frequently targeted services include SQL, SMTP, and SSH.

### Geolocation Distribution of Outbound Attacks

Outbound attack targets are predominantly located in Europe and North America (Figure 14b). There are fewer outbound attack targets in Eastern Asia compared to inbound attack sources. A specific AS in Spain, previously discussed in the context of inbound attacks, receives more than 35% of outbound attacks, mainly consisting of brute-force, TDS, and SQL attacks.

### Existing Security Practices

#### Inbound Attacks: TCP SYN, UDP, ICMP Floods, and DNS Reflection

Cloud VMs are accessible through VIPs, and traffic to these VIPs is routed through a load-balancing infrastructure [42]. At this infrastructure, the cloud can monitor, detect, and mitigate flood attacks using techniques such as SYN cookies, rate limiting, and connection limits to ensure that such attacks do not impact customer VM instances [7]. Tenants can also use scale-out (adding more VMs on demand) or scale-up (deploying resource-rich VMs) methods to increase resilience against attacks [4].

Cloud systems have multiple in-built mechanisms to safeguard tenants. For example, the hypervisor hosting guest VMs is neither directly addressable internally by other tenants nor externally. Additional filters block broadcast and multicast traffic, except for what is needed to maintain DHCP leases. Inside the VMs, tenants can enable web server add-ons to protect against certain DoS (Denial of Service) attacks [41]. For TCP SYN flooding, a security rule can track significant deviations from the norm in terms of half-open TCP sessions and drop further TCP SYN packets from specific sources [5].

#### Port Scans

Unauthorized port scans are considered a violation of cloud use policy and are blocked by cloud providers [3]. By default, all inbound ports on VMs are closed except those opened by tenants. Tenants can specify service definition files to open necessary internal endpoints and control communication with them [8]. Additionally, tenants can use security groups or firewalls to block unauthorized traffic [41].

#### Other Inbound Attacks

Some cloud providers do not actively block network traffic affecting individual tenants because the infrastructure does not interpret the expected behavior of customer applications. Instead, they allow tenants to use firewall proxy devices like Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) to terminate and forward traffic to VM endpoints. Tenants can also use network ACLs or VLANs to prevent packets from certain IP addresses from reaching VMs [7].

Cloud providers can leverage high-level signals from workloads running on the cloud. One such signal is the number of open ports. Legitimate customers typically minimize the number of open ports to reduce vulnerability, while compromised accounts or VMs may exhibit anomalous activities such as running botnet controllers or torrent services on multiple open ports. The cloud security team monitors such activities and shuts down misbehaving tenant VMs.

#### Outbound Attacks

To mitigate outbound attacks, it is essential to identify fraudulent VMs when a tenant sets up a subscription. Cloud providers use anti-fraud techniques such as credit card validation, estimating geographical distance from the IP address used for login to the billing address, and checking if the email address is from a free email provider. If an attack is successful, compromised VMs can be used for malicious activities, such as sending spam. Cloud providers can enforce limits on the number of emails a VM can send and prevent SMTP open relay, which can be used to spread spam [5].

### Related Work

This paper presents one of the first large-scale studies to investigate the prevalence of network-based attacks in the cloud. We compare our work with related research on detecting and understanding internet-based attacks.

#### Attack Detection Methods

Previous works have used NetFlow logs to understand DDoS attacks and traffic anomalies in ISP networks [38, 22, 36, 35]. Our approach is similar but focuses on a broader set of attacks in the cloud. Most prior studies on application-level attacks analyze content (e.g., spam [15, 25], SQL injection [18], SSH [32]). Our work shows that network-level signatures, such as volumes, spread, TCP flags, and communication patterns, can also detect some of these attacks. Previous research has shown that application-level attacks (e.g., spam) have strong network-level signatures [46]. We validate our network-based detection by comparing detected attacks against security appliance alerts and incident reports. Although network-based detection may not capture all types of application-level attacks (e.g., malware), it is more practical to implement in today's cloud monitoring infrastructure.

#### Attack Characterization

There is extensive literature on characterizing internet-based attacks. Most prior efforts (e.g., [10, 13, 17, 40, 46, 51]) focus on one or a few types of attacks. Given the importance of cloud services, understanding attacks from and to the cloud is critical. Our study investigates a wide diversity of inbound and outbound attacks in the cloud, differentiating DDoS attacks based on protocols (TCP SYN, UDP, DNS reflection) and showing that other types of attacks (e.g., brute-force, port scans, and TDS) also require attention. We provide detailed characteristics of attacks in the cloud, including affected cloud services, internet origins and targets, and the intensity and frequency of these attacks. These results can guide the future design of attack detection and mitigation systems for the cloud.

### Conclusion

We investigated the prevalence of network-based attacks both on and off the cloud. Our study provides the first comprehensive measurement of the characteristics of a wide range of cloud attacks, varying in complexity, intensity, duration, and distribution. Our findings show a significant increase in the scale, volume, and sophistication of these attacks. Our results have been used by the cloud security team to identify correlations and improve mitigations for different attack types. We hope this study motivates future research towards designing effective attack detection and mitigation systems for the cloud. In future work, we plan to extend our measurement study to analyze application-level attacks, compare across attack categories, and leverage packet traces for deeper analysis.
