While working on a PHP file, the editor panel in Visual Studio Code becomes unresponsive after a few seconds, necessitating a force quit of the entire program. Although the menu bar remains interactive, selecting "Exit" does not close the application. The Task Manager indicates that the `code.exe` process is consuming a consistent 40% of the CPU.

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 Pro x64 (Build 1511)
- **Visual Studio Code Version:** 0.10.1
