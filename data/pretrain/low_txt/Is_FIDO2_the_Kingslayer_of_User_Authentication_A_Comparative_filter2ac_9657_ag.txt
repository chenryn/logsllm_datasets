### Appendix A: Details on Comparison of Text-Based Passwords with FIDO2 1FA Using a Yubico Security Key

#### A. Benefits Dependent Only on FIDO2

**a) Usability:**
- **Scalable-for-Users (SFU):** A single FIDO2 authenticator can be used for hundreds of accounts.
- **Nothing-to-Carry (NTC):** FIDO2 uses hardware-based authenticators, so users do not need to remember or carry additional information.
- **Easy-Recovery-from-Loss (ERL):** FIDO2 does not inherently provide this benefit; the website must offer recovery or secondary authentication options.

**b) Deployability:**
- **Server-Compatible (SC):** FIDO2 is not server-compatible, as relying parties must support it separately.
- **Mature (M):** FIDO2 is not yet fully mature but is gaining adoption.
- **Non-Proprietary (NP):** FIDO2 is non-proprietary, although many authenticators in the market are proprietary.

**c) Security:**
- **Resilient-to-Physical-Observation (RPO):** FIDO2 is resilient to physical observation because it uses a challenge-response protocol based on public key cryptography.
- **Resilient-to-Targeted-Impersonation (RTI):** FIDO2 is resilient to targeted impersonation.
- **Resilient-to-Throttled-Guessing (RTG):** FIDO2 is resilient to throttled guessing.
- **Resilient-to-Leaks-from-Other-Verifiers (RLOV):** FIDO2 has no shared secret between the user and the relying party, making it resilient to leaks from other verifiers.
- **No-Trusted-Third-Party (NTTP):** FIDO2 does not require a trusted third party.
- **Unlinkable (U):** During registration, a new unique key pair is created by the authenticator per account, preventing linking of authenticators and user accounts.
- **Resilient-to-Unthrottled-Guessing (RUG):** FIDO2 is resilient to unthrottled guessing.
- **Resilient-to-Phishing (RP):** FIDO2 is resilient to phishing attacks.

#### B. Benefits Dependent Primarily on Authenticator

**a) Usability:**
- **Memorywise-Effortless (ME):** FIDO2 with the Yubico Security Key requires only a button press, making it memorywise effortless.
- **Physically-Effortless (PE):** Inserting the Security Key and pressing a flashing button is physically effortless.
- **Easy-to-Learn (ETL):** The process is easy to learn and efficient to use.
- **Infrequent-Errors (IE):** Assuming proper implementation, FIDO2 should have infrequent errors, though this depends on the authenticator.

**b) Deployability:**
- **Accessible (A):** Pushing the button is as accessible as entering a password.
- **Quasi-Negligible-Cost-per-User (QNCP):** With a one-time investment of $20–$27 for the Yubico Security Key, this solution is quasi-negligible cost per user.

**c) Security:**
- **Resilient-to-Internal-Observation (RIO):** The Security Key has its own physical button, making it resilient to internal observation.
- **Resilient-to-Theft (RT):** The Security Key is not resilient to theft, as possession alone suffices for authentication.
- **Requiring-Explicit-Consent (REC):** Requiring a button push ensures explicit consent for authentication.
