## 1. Introduction to Lawful Interception

### ETSI Definition of (Lawful) Interception
- **Definition:** Lawful interception is an action based on the law, performed by a network operator, access provider, or service provider (NWO/AP/SvP), to make certain information available and provide it to a law enforcement monitoring facility.

#### Roles:
- **Network Operator/Access Provider/Service Provider (NWO/AP/SvP)**
- **Law Enforcement Agency (LEA)**
- **Law Enforcement Monitoring Facility (LEMF)**

#### Rationale for Interception
- **Why Intercept?**
  - Terrorism
  - Pedophilia rings
  - Cyber stalking
  - Data theft and industrial espionage
  - Drug dealing on the internet

- **Why Not?**
  - Privacy concerns
  - Security issues

### Legal Issues in Lawful Interception
- **Relevance of Evidence:**
  - **Admissible:** Can evidence be considered in court? (varies by country)
  - **Authentic:** Explicitly linking data to individuals
  - **Accurate:** Reliability of the surveillance process over the content of the intercept
  - **Complete:** Tells a "complete" story of a particular circumstance
  - **Convincing to Juries:** Probative value and subjective practical test of presentation

- **Admissibility of Surveillance Evidence:**
  - **Virtual Locus Delicti:** Difficulty in finding criminals in delicto flagrante
  - **Expert Evidence:** Juries are not composed of network specialists; legal, not scientific, decision-making
  - **Primary vs. Secondary Evidence:**
    - **Primary:** Best possible evidence (e.g., original document)
    - **Secondary:** Clearly not the primary source (e.g., copy)

## 2. Interception of Internet Services

### Defined Internet Services
- Access to the Internet
- Services over the Internet, such as:
  - Web surfing (e.g., HTML)
  - Email
  - Chat and ICQ
  - VoIP, FoIP
  - FTP
  - Telnet

### Encrypted Traffic
- **Secure Communication:**
  - Secure email (e.g., PGP, S/MIME)
  - Secure web browsing (e.g., HTTPS, SSL, TLS)
  - Virtual Private Networks (VPNs, e.g., IPSec)
  - Encrypted IP telephony (e.g., PGP-phone, Nautilus)

- **Handling Encryption:**
  - If applied by NWO/AP/SvP, encryption should be stripped before sending to LEMF, or keys should be made available to LEA.
  - Otherwise, it poses a challenge for the LEA.

### Technical Challenges
- **Requirements:**
  - Maintain transparency and standard of communication
  - Identify target and monitoring radius
  - Capture intercept information effectively
  - Packet reassembly
  - Software complexity increases bugginess
  - Peering with LEMF

## 3. Origins in the European Community

### Legal Basis in the EU
- **EU Directive**
- **Convention on Cybercrime (Council of Europe):**
  - Article 20: Real-time collection of traffic data
  - Article 21: Interception of content data
- **National Laws and Regulations:**
  - Technically, not Carnivore or CALEA
  - Standards and best practices approach
  - IETF's standpoint (RFC 2804: IETF Policy on Wiretapping)

## 4. The European Interception Legislation in Brief

### Solution Requirements
- **France:**
  - Commission Nationale de Contrôle des Interceptions de Sécurité (La loi 91-636)
  - Loi sur la Sécurité Quotidienne (November 2001)

- **Germany:**
  - G-10 (2001): Gesetz zur Beschränkung des Brief-, Post- und Fernmeldegeheimnisses
  - Counter-Terrorism Act (January 2002)

- **UK:**
  - Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000
  - Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001

### The Case in Holland
- **At the Forefront of LI: Both Legally and Technically**
  - Dutch Telecommunications Act 1998: Operator Responsibilities
  - Dutch Code of Criminal Proceedings: Initiation and handling of interception requests
  - Special Investigation Powers Act: Streamlines criminal investigation methods
  - WETVOORSTEL 20859: Backdoor decree for NAW info
  - LIO (National Interception Office): In operation since end of 2002
  - CIOT: Central bureau for telecom interception

## 5. ETSI

### Technical Specifications of Lawful Interception
- **ETSI Model:**
  - **NWO/AP/SvP’s Administration Function**
  - **IRI Mediation Function**
  - **CC Mediation Function**
  - **Network Internal Functions (IIF, INI)**
  - **Intercept Related Information (IRI)**
  - **Content of Communication (CC)**
  - **LI Handover Interface (HI1, HI2, HI3)**
  - **LEMF and LEA Domain**

- **Purpose of ETSI LI Standardization:**
  - Facilitate the economic realization of lawful interception that complies with national and international conventions and legislation
  - Enable interoperability, focusing on handover protocol

- **Current Status:**
  - Comprised primarily of operators and vendors
  - ETSI TR 101 944: The Issues
  - Responsibility: Addressed separately for Access Providers and Service Providers
  - 5-layer model: Network Level and Service Level division
  - Implementation Architecture: Telephone circuits (PSTN/ISDN), Digital Subscriber Line (xDSL), Local Area Network (LAN)

This revised version aims to provide a more structured, clear, and professional presentation of the topic.
