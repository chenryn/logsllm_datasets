### Unreachable States in the Composed Model

In our approach, we avoid states that are unreachable in the composed model, a feature that is also highlighted in [11] regarding decomposition approaches.

### Second Version of the Model with Unbalanced Macro State Probabilities

We now introduce a second version of the model, characterized by more unbalanced macro state probabilities. This adjustment allows for a clearer identification of the most significant states. The model includes one heavily loaded queue (number 6) with four buffer places and an arrival rate of 3.0, while the remaining queues have an arrival rate of 0.1. Servers remain at queue 6 as long as there are customers waiting for service. In contrast, at the other queues, only one customer is served, and only one server is allowed to serve customers. The GSPN subnets corresponding to these strategies can be found in [1].

### Impact on Macro State Probabilities

These modifications result in higher probabilities for macro states where two or three servers are at the heavily loaded queue 6, compared to the remaining macro states.

### CTMC and Approximation Results

The Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) derived from this model has 1,117,536 states. For the approximation, we use \(\theta = 1,819\) and \(\phi = 1,117,536\). The results and computational effort for this example are shown in Figure 3. As in the previous version, the solution effort increases with \(\theta\), but the approximation error decreases much faster. This indicates that a very good approximation can be achieved by considering only a small portion of the state space in detail.

Additionally, we evaluated the effect of using a Gauss-Seidel-like iteration scheme at the macro state level. However, as shown in the left part of Figure 3, the reduction in solution time with this new iteration scheme is only minor.

### Conclusions

We presented an iterative solution approach for large Markov chains resulting from superposed GSPNs or related modeling formalisms. Based on the model structure, where a model is described by \(k\) interacting components, the Markov chain is \(k\)-dimensional, and the generator matrix can be represented as a sum of Kronecker products using compact component matrices. This representation can be leveraged in iterative solution techniques, and many efficient methods have been developed in recent years. However, the limiting factor in these techniques is the size of the iteration vector, which equals the number of reachable states.

Our approach avoids the use of vectors of the size of the state space by representing parts of the vectors in a compact form as Kronecter products of component vectors. This compact representation allows for extremely efficient analysis, though it introduces an approximation error. The iterative approach reduces this error by representing parts of the vector in detail and parts as Kronecker products. This method is particularly useful for models with unbalanced state probabilities, such as reliability models, where the system is mainly in a small number of states. Unlike other approximation methods, our approach adaptively decides which parts to represent in detail and which parts to aggregate, based on a threshold for memory requirements.

### Further Considerations

While we presented the approach using a hierarchical Kronecker representation of the generator matrix, it can also be applied to other representations, such as graph-based methods for storing states. The decision on which states to represent in detail is based on an estimate of the steady-state probability. Another idea would be to use a reward vector for the system states. Our implementation and description use the Power method, although it is known to have slow convergence. Solution times can be significantly reduced by using other iterative solution methods, such as block Gauss-Seidel with integrated aggregation/disaggregation. The integration of these methods with the approximate solution technique is an ongoing research topic.
