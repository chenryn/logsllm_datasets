### 4.3.1 Image Selection and Entropy

After participants selected a suitable image, we recorded the frequency with which each of the seven images in Figure 3 was chosen. By comparing the most frequently chosen images to the entropy calculations for each image in Table 2, we observed that the most frequently chosen images (Images 4 and 6) also had the highest per-click entropy. This indicates that most participants in our study chose the most suitable images, which is encouraging because these images are likely to generate stronger passwords.

Next, we focused on the images deemed suitable by the Stage 1 image saliency measurement, to address usability and memorability.

### 4.3.2 Usability and Memorability

To measure usability, we recorded the time taken for password creation and recall. As shown in Figure 5, the average creation time ranged from approximately 11 seconds to 28 seconds. The login and recall times were generally lower, with the one-week recall time closely matching the initial recall (login) time. It is acceptable for the creation time to be longer since it is a one-time process; therefore, it is a positive outcome that the login and recall times are relatively shorter, and the one-week recall time is similar to the immediate recall time. This suggests that the created passwords were relatively easy to enter, providing evidence for the ease of use in our third research question in Section 4. However, these times are likely higher than those required for entering a textual password, possibly due to the lack of familiarity and repetition with our graphical password method.

Interestingly, Image 4, the second most suitable image, had higher creation, login, and recall times compared to other images. In contrast, the most suitable image, Image 6, had comparatively low creation, login, and recall times. This discrepancy is likely due to the specific content of the images.

We measured the time participants took to log in or recall their passwords and the number of attempts needed to successfully enter the password. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to assess whether there were any significant differences between the images. Table 7 indicates that there were no statistically significant differences in login and recall times, nor in the number of attempts needed for successful authentication during the initial login (login-retry) and the one-week recall (recall-retry). Thus, using the most suitable images did not affect login or recall times, indicating that it does not negatively impact the usability of graphical passwords.

Another key aspect of usability is user satisfaction with the proposed scheme. We conducted interviews with participants after the initial creation and recall phases. Figure 6 shows the responses related to user satisfaction. Approximately 68% of participants found it easy or very easy to remember their password, while opinions were split on whether graphical passwords were slower to use compared to traditional methods. Slightly more than half of the participants found graphical passwords easy to use. These results suggest that while graphical passwords are easy to remember, they are not necessarily faster or easier to use than traditional methods, indicating that they are about as usable as traditional methods. This supports our fourth research question regarding memorability, as less suitable images showed similar creation and recall times to more suitable images. However, it is encouraging that participants did not find graphical passwords less usable than traditional methods, despite being less familiar with our method.

### 4.3.3 User Choice

To address the second research question in Section 4 regarding user choice of Regions of Interest (RoIs), we created heatmaps (see Figure 7) to show how frequently each RoI was chosen. The colors range from green (lightly shaded) for the least frequently selected regions to yellow and red (darker shading) for the most frequently selected regions. If an RoI was not chosen or if the region was not considered an RoI (since it did not contain a detected object), the corresponding square is left uncolored.

For example, in the heatmap of Image 4 (Figure 8a), one of the two most suitable images, the center of the circular object was frequently selected (red/darkly shaded square), with a yellow square just below it. This could be due to participants selecting the center but with less accuracy. Similarly, in the heatmap for Image 8 (Figure 8d), the two faces in the image were frequently selected, consistent with previous findings that faces are attractive regions [37].

Overall, the heatmaps in Figure 7 show that users tend to select RoIs relatively evenly, as indicated by the prevalence of green/lightly shaded RoIs in each image. This suggests that while hotspots do exist, they are not necessarily preferentially chosen by users. This supports our intuition from Section 3.2.1 that more RoIs may encourage users to select visually interesting and potentially memorable regions, even if they are not hotspots. We excluded non-RoI squares from this assessment, as we believe selections without detected RoIs will not be memorable. We intend to test this assumption in future work.

### 5. Conclusion

Graphical passwords have become a viable authentication method due to their usability in terms of login error rate [6]. However, developing a method to evaluate the predictability of graphical passwords is essential to ensure their strength is at least equal to that of textual passwords. In this work, we contribute to the literature on graphical password strength by proposing a measurement based on overall image saliency and content. Our measurement can guide the selection of suitable images for graphical passwords without requiring additional user effort, which is our main contribution.

Our primary message is that graphical passwords are well-suited for touch-based input on modern mobile devices, are more memorable than textual passwords, and thus have greater potential for future research. Research to improve the security, memorability, and usability of graphical passwords may lead to systems better suited for keyboardless or hard-to-type-on devices, where traditional textual passwords are unlikely to improve.

We evaluated our saliency measurement model using existing graphical password click points and found that more salient regions on an image correspond to higher entropy and a larger theoretical and practical password space. We then determined that the resultant passwords are stronger when a guiding image with more RoIs is chosen. In future work, we plan to broaden the participant pool to include more diverse users to generalize the results and ask more in-depth questions about user reasoning behind image choices. We also aim to further support our hypotheses regarding image saliency and regions of interest with a broader set of images.

Another important contribution of this work is challenging the belief that hotspots are detrimental to graphical password guiding images. We show that a more complex image (i.e., one with more RoIs) can provide more possible click points, potentially leading to less guessable passwords or ones that are more computationally intensive and time-consuming for attackers. This spreads potential user click points over the image, making dictionary attacks that need to consider all hotspots less feasible.

Future extensions include considering other object detection algorithms and color features that may provide additional information about the regions likely to be selected by users. Additional future work will explore whether images with more RoIs encourage users to choose more secure and memorable graphical passwords, possibly with the addition of a graphical password strength meter based on the strength metric proposed in this work.
