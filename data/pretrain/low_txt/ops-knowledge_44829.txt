**Subject: Seeking Assistance with Django-LFS Deployment on a Root Server**

Dear Community,

I hope you can assist me with an issue I'm facing. I have been developing a web shop for my company using Django and Lightning Fast Shop (LFS). The project is now essentially complete, and I have been running it on a virtual Ubuntu machine on my PC. However, keeping my PC on all the time to allow others to access the site has become inconvenient. Therefore, I decided to deploy it on a root server.

I acquired a JiffyBox and installed Ubuntu on it. I successfully set up Gnome and connected to the server via VNC. I then uploaded my completed project to the server using FTP.

Initially, I thought I could simply download Django-LFS, create a new project, and replace the project files with my finished ones. This method worked when I tested it on my virtual machine. Unfortunately, it did not work on the root server. When I tried to run `bin/django runserver`, I received the error message "bash: bin/django: Permission denied." Using `sudo` resulted in "sudo: bin/django: command not found."

I realized that I had downloaded a newer version of Django-LFS and attempted to use the same version as on my virtual machine, but this also did not resolve the issue.

I am becoming increasingly frustrated and would greatly appreciate any help or guidance you can provide.

### Additional Information:
- **Settings**: Have I updated all settings in `settings.py` (e.g., paths to static files, project paths)?
- **Server**: Which web server am I using? (Django development server, Apache, Nginx)
- **Permissions**: Do I have the necessary permissions over all files in the project? I should ensure that the file owner is the user I am logged in as, not root.
- **uWSGI**: Am I using uWSGI?
- **Dependencies**: Have I installed all the same applications and dependencies as on my virtual machine?
- **Version Consistency**: Have I installed the exact same versions of all packages as on my virtual machine?

### Steps I Followed When Moving from VM to Server:
1. **Review and Update `settings.py`**: Ensure all paths are correctly updated.
2. **Check File Permissions**: Verify that the web server has the necessary permissions to access the project folder.
3. **Install Packages**: I have a list of required packages and their versions in a `packages.txt` file. I install these using `pip install -r packages.txt`.
4. **Update Virtual Hosts**: If using Apache or Nginx, update the virtual host configuration to reflect the new paths.
5. **uWSGI Configuration**: If using uWSGI, update the uWSGI settings accordingly.

To downgrade pip packages, I sometimes need to delete the egg files, as pip will install the already downloaded package even if the specified version is different. To check the current versions of installed packages, I use `pip freeze`. To export all pip packages to a file, I use `pip freeze > packages.txt` and to install from this file, I use `pip install -r packages.txt`.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Best regards,
Krytos
