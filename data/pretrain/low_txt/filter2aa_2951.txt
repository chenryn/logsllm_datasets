# Security When Nanoseconds Count
## James Arlen, CISA
### DEF CON 19

**Disclaimer:**
I am employed in the information security (Infosec) industry, but I am not authorized to speak on behalf of my employer or clients. Everything I say can be attributed to the voices in your head.

## Credentials
- Over 15 years as an information security specialist
- Experience in staff operations, consulting, auditing, and research
- Specialization in utilities (grid operations, generation, distribution) and financial sectors (banks, trust companies, trading)
- Founder of think|haus
- Despite this, I still do not consider myself an expert in any one area.

## Nanoseconds...

## Admiral Hopper Says...
From a 1982 interview by Morley Safer:
- The speed of light is a critical factor.
- In a millisecond, light travels approximately 300 km (186 miles).
- In a microsecond, light travels about 300 m (328 yards).
- In a nanosecond, light travels roughly 30 cm (1 foot).

## Before You Ask...
- This talk will focus on high-speed trading and its security implications.
- I will not discuss buzzwords such as SCADA, APT, PCI-DSS, WikiLeaks, (anti-|lulz)sec, hacktivism, etc.

## Finance at DEF CON?
- Yes, finance is relevant here.
- DEF CON is all about offensive and defensive techniques and technologies.
- Knowing about vulnerabilities can help focus attention.
- Sometimes, seemingly crazy ideas have a history of becoming reality.

## Trading History
- 1200s: Commodity and debt trading
- 1500s: Inter-market trading
- 1600s: Equity trading
- Early 1800s: Reuters uses carrier pigeons for market data
- Late 1800s: Electronic ticker tapes become widespread
- Mid-1900s: Quotation systems (next price rather than last price) become common
- Late 1900s: Computers are used to maintain exchange records
- Early 2000s: Automated trading without human intervention begins

## Definitions
- **High-Speed Trading:** Committing trades faster than human interactive speeds.
- **Algorithmic Trading:** Trades based on mathematical results from external sources like news and market data.

## Arbitrage
- The practice of taking advantage of price differences between two or more markets.
- Geographically separated markets (in space).
- Temporal differences (in time) between when information is available and when it is widely known.

## Time
- In the mid-20th century, trade times were measured in minutes.
- By the late 1800s, trade times were reduced to minutes.
- In the 1900s, trade times were in seconds.
- In the 2000s, trade times are in hundreds of microseconds.
- Future trade times may involve even faster technologies.

## Architecture

## How Fast Is Fast?
- **Seconds:** You have no position.
- **Milliseconds:** You lose nearly every time.
- **Sub-Millisecond:** Big players regularly beat you.
- **Hundreds of Microseconds:** You’re a bit player and missing a lot.
- **Tens of Microseconds:** You’re usually winning.

## Predictability
- Predictable speed is almost as important as sheer speed.
- Enemies include jitter, packet loss, and inefficient protocols (like TCP).
- Dropped packets mean lost money.

## Proximity
- Proximity reduces speed, latency, and jitter effects.
- Being on the LAN, not the MAN or WAN, is crucial.

## Latency Costs Money
- Latency has a measurable cost and is therefore fundable.

## Missing?

## Oh Crap.

## Dude, Where’s My Firewall?
- No firewalls... they add significant latency.
- Latency costs money.
- Risk < Cost < Profit

## ACL Me Please?
- No Access Control Lists (ACLs).
- ACLs add latency.
- Most switches can’t cut through switch while ACLs are enabled.
- Risk < Cost < Profit

## Harden This...
- No meaningful system hardening.
- Reduced system loading (stripped bare).
- Custom interfacing code (Ethernet, InfiniBand, PCIe).
- Usual complaints about maintainability and problem resolution.

## Specialized Systems

## Threat Modeling
- We know what’s missing in our usual suite of controls.
- How do we describe these gaps?
- How do we determine reasonable threats to build protective measures against?

## THREAT: Vendors
- Trust that the marketing material is accurate.
- Trust that vendors haven’t hired malicious actors.

## MAYBE: Vendors
- Consider a vendor developer who alters patches to change the Precision Time Protocol (PTPv2 - 802.1AS) timing.
- [IEEE 802.1AS](http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/802.1as.html)

## THREAT: Developers
- In algorithmic trading, developers often lack traditional SDLC controls.
- Developers may be traders with live access to production algo engines, making on-the-fly changes.

## YES: Developers
- **Sergey Aleynikov:**
  - July 3, 2009
  - Stole 32 MB of code from Goldman Sachs
  - Sentenced to 97 months (8 years 1 month) and $12,500 fine

  - [Facebook Group](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=123550517320)

## THREAT: The Insider
- Not the typical insider threat.
- How to deal with a trader or administrator using access to market data networks to cause negative effects on other participants?

## YES: Traders
- **Samarth Agrawal:**
  - April 16, 2010
  - Stole several hundred pages of code from Societe Generale
  - Sentenced to 3 years in prison, 2 years supervised release, and deportation
  - [Wired Article](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/04/bankerarrested/)

## THREAT: The Market
- An unusual technical threat.
- Can the market itself cause issues with your systems?
- Malformed messages, transaction risk scrutiny, and compromised systems.

## YES: Market
- **Flash Crash (May 6, 2010):**
  - DJIA dropped 900 points in minutes.
  - [Nanex Report](http://www.nanex.net/20100506/FlashCrashAnalysis_Part1-1.html)

## Ed Felten’s Summary
1. High quote request volume to NYSE computers.
2. Quote queue backlog caused delays.
3. Outdated quotes with recent timestamps confused other market participants.
4. Misinformation destabilized the market.
5. Instability bred more instability, leading to a precipitous drop.

## Questioning Trust
- Is it possible to trust within this framework?
- How to monitor threats effectively?

## Traditional Security Fails
- 100,000 times too slow.
- Unwilling to recognize the fundamentally different world.
- Focused on checkbox compliance.

## Answer the Hard One - Later
- How to secure custom everything?
- How to be fast enough?
- How to make the case that security efforts reduce risk and prevent disaster?

## Do Something!
- Focus on network security basics.
- Even a little Layer 4 goodness would help.

## IT Security: The Next Generation
- Where is the next generation of security solutions?
- Juniper and Cisco are starting, but why aren’t we keeping up?

## Well, Thanks. What Now?

## DO ANYTHING
- Step up and do anything.
- Developing an architectural understanding is better than nothing.
- Make friends and influence people.

## Product Vendors
- Challenge your vendors.
- Demand more than checkboxes.
- There are other markets besides credit card compliance.
- Money is available for developing exotic solutions.

## Risk, Process, Policy, GRC
- Work with business partners.
- They understand risk and have a different tolerance for it.
- Use their knowledge to make good decisions.
- Avoid dogmatic statements.

## Compliance
- IT compliance and financial compliance professionals should collaborate.
- The SEC is taking an active interest.
- [Large Trader Reporting Rule (13h-1)](http://sec.gov/news/press/2011/2011-154.htm)
- Other regulators are watching.

## In the Trenches
- Understand business partners’ needs.
- Look for solutions.
- Build proof-of-concept (PoC) rigs to test.
- Encourage vendors to innovate.
- Prepare for continued downward pressure on transaction times.
