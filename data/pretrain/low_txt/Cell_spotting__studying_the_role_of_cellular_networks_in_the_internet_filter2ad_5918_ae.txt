### Cellular Demand and Network Trends

#### Key Findings

**Finding 1: Concentration of Cellular Traffic**
- A significant portion of cellular traffic is concentrated in a small number of active IP addresses, while the majority of addresses carry minimal demand. This concentration must be considered when measuring cellular networks from IP addresses, as it allows for the capture of representative samples with a relatively small number of target addresses.

**Finding 2: Shared DNS Resolvers in Mixed Networks**
- In mixed cellular networks, nearly 60% of DNS resolvers are shared between cellular and fixed-line clients. This implies that DNS resolvers alone are insufficient for identifying client types. The use of shared resolvers also complicates client localization for common request routing systems. For example, in a large Brazilian mobile network operator (MNO), while cellular and fixed-line clients shared resolvers, the resolvers were geographically proximal only for fixed-line clients. Cellular clients were located over 1,470 miles away.

**Finding 3: Public DNS Usage by Cellular Clients**
- Significant public DNS usage by cellular clients outside the U.S. was observed, challenging the common assumption that cellular clients only use operator-provided DNS. This further complicates attempts to use DNS for end-user mapping in content delivery networks (CDNs).

### Macroscopic View of Cellular Networks

#### Global Cellular Demand Distribution

We examine the global distribution of cellular demand at the continent level, considering the following metrics:
1. The percentage of a continent’s demand that is cellular.
2. The percentage of global cellular demand originating from each continent.
3. The number of mobile subscribers per continent [17].
4. The cellular demand per subscriber.

**Table 8: Summary of Metrics by Continent**

| Continent | % of Demand (Cellular) | % of Global Cellular Demand | Mobile Subscribers (in millions) | Cellular Demand per Subscriber |
|-----------|------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Asia      | 25.5%                  | 38.9%                       | 4,380                            | 1.2 GB                          |
| Africa    | 26.0%                  | 2.9%                        | 800                              | 0.5 GB                          |
| Europe    | 11.3%                  | 15.9%                       | 800                              | 0.8 GB                          |
| North America | 15.0%               | 35.0%                       | 300                              | 1.5 GB                          |
| South America | 12.0%              | 4.1%                        | 400                              | 0.6 GB                          |
| Oceania   | 10.0%                  | 3.0%                        | 30                               | 1.8 GB                          |

**Key Observations:**
- **Global Cellular Demand:** Cellular networks account for 16.2% of all global demand, which is higher than previous industry reports (e.g., Ericsson's 2016 report [10] states 8%).
- **Regional Variations:** The fraction of cellular demand varies significantly across continents. Africa and Asia have the highest fractions (26% and 25.5%, respectively), attributed to limited fixed-line infrastructure. Europe, despite its mature mobile telecommunications industry, has a lower fraction (11.3%) due to well-developed fixed-line networks.
- **Exclusion of China:** Our calculations exclude data from China due to uncertainties in the demand values, leading to an underestimation of overall demand from Asia.

#### Country-Level Statistics

We analyze the distribution of cellular demand across individual countries within each continent. Figure 11 illustrates the top ten countries in terms of cellular demand, highlighting the heavy-tailed distribution. The U.S. accounts for over 30% of global cellular demand, and the top 5 countries (mostly in Asia, with the U.S. being the exception) contribute 55.7% of global demand. The top 20 countries make up 80% of the global total.

**Figure 12: Relationship Between Cellular Demand and Fraction of Total Demand**

- **Country-Specific Trends:** Countries like Laos and Ghana rely heavily on cellular connectivity, with 87.1% and 95.9% of their overall demand, respectively. Indonesia, the fourth-largest country for cellular demand, uses cellular connectivity for 63% of its total traffic demand.
- **Frontier Countries:** Countries along the upper right frontier of the graph (e.g., U.S., Ghana, Indonesia) represent ideal targets for further study to understand traffic dynamics and user behavior in areas dominated by mobile connectivity.

### Summary of Key Findings

1. **Global Cellular Traffic:** Cellular traffic constitutes 16.2% of all global traffic demand. In Asia and Africa, cellular traffic accounts for 25.5% and 26% of continent demand, respectively.
2. **Top Country Dominance:** The top 5 countries account for 55.7% of global cellular traffic demand, and the top 20 comprise 80%.
3. **Dominant Cellular Connectivity:** In several countries (e.g., Laos, Indonesia), cellular access is the primary form of Internet connectivity, making it a critical part of their infrastructure.

### Conclusion

This paper presents the first global analysis of cellular networks, using client browser signals to accurately identify cellular network addresses. We leveraged the global vantage point of one of the world's largest CDNs to map the global cellular IP space and analyze their traffic demand. Future work will explore the evolution of cellular addresses and shifts in demand, as well as characterizing user behavior across various network services.
