### Introduction

SeRLoc is a secure localization scheme that leverages the properties of the physical medium (such as communication range constraints) and computationally efficient cryptographic primitives to enable sensors to determine their location, even in the presence of security threats. Sensors rely on localization information transmitted from reference points with known locations and orientations to estimate their positions. SeRLoc ensures secure localization under the assumption that an attacker cannot selectively jam transmissions from reference points. To enhance localization accuracy, reference points are equipped with directional antennas. However, further improvements in accuracy may require the deployment of more reference points or the use of more directional antennas at each reference point.

### SPINE: Secure Range-Based Positioning

In [6], Șerbănuță Capkun and Jean-Pierre Hubaux propose SPINE, a secure range-based positioning system that bounds the distance of each sensor to at least three reference points using timers with nanosecond precision. If a sensor is within a triangle formed by three reference points, it can compute its position via a method called verifiable multilateration. This method provides a robust position estimate, assuming that no attacker colludes with compromised nodes. However, verifiable multilateration requires a high number of reference points.

### ROPE: Robust Position Estimation

In [20], Lazos et al. introduce ROPE, a range-independent localization scheme designed to limit the impact of multiple attacks, such as wormhole attacks, Sybil attacks, and selective jamming, without requiring a large number of reference points. ROPE secures beacon transmissions from reference points using computationally efficient cryptographic primitives and verifies the distance of each sensor to at least one reference point through distance bounding. Consequently, any adversary can only displace a sensor within a limited region.

### Robust Range-Dependent Localization

In [22], Liu et al. propose a robust range-dependent localization method that uses Minimum Mean Square Estimation (MMSE) to filter outliers and compute the position of sensors using a consistent set of range estimates. This method prevents attackers from displacing sensors by corrupting a small set of range estimates. However, if the attacker successfully corrupts a large set of range estimates (more than the benign ones), the valid set of range estimates cannot be identified.

### Statistical Methods for Outlier Filtering

In [21], Li et al. suggest using robust statistical methods, such as Least Median Squares (LMS), to filter out outliers in the sample set used to estimate the sensors' location. The authors assume that the majority of the observations collected by each sensor are benign, and only a few samples are corrupted. However, in specific types of attacks like the wormhole and Sybil attacks, the majority of the samples can be malicious.

### Discussion and Open Problems

Localization schemes for robust estimation of sensor positions in the presence of adversaries can be classified into two main categories. The first category, exemplified by [21] and [22], does not consider a specific adversarial model but assumes that some fraction of the localization information is corrupted while the majority of the observations are benign. These schemes use statistical methods to filter out outliers and estimate the position of sensors by considering only a consistent subset of the collected observations.

The second category, represented by [6], [18]–[20], considers specific adversarial models and examines potential attacks an adversary can launch to disrupt the localization process. Using the characteristics of these adversarial models, these schemes propose mechanisms to secure localization against different types of feasible attacks.

HiRLoc belongs to the second class of algorithms, where a specific adversarial model is considered. We have shown that an adversary cannot disrupt HiRLoc by corrupting range estimates, as no such estimates are used to compute the position of sensors. An attacker can potentially enlarge the communication range of the locators to displace the sensors, but this enlargement is equivalent to a wormhole attack, which HiRLoc can detect and prevent with a very high probability. An attacker can also attempt to reduce the communication range, but this does not lead to sensor displacement since any sensor hearing a locator will still be within the nominal communication range, even if it has been reduced by an attack.

An adversary attempting to disrupt HiRLoc gains no benefit from compromising sensor nodes, as sensors do not assist in the localization of other sensors. The only usable information extracted from compromising a sensor is the globally shared key \( K_0 \). Although a single sensor compromise reveals \( K_0 \), broadcasting with a commonly shared key is the most bandwidth and energy-efficient solution. The adversary can only use \( K_0 \) to launch a Sybil attack, which can be prevented with a high probability. For higher security, broadcast authentication techniques can be adopted, but these require time synchronization among all network nodes, which is not currently required for HiRLoc.

In HiRLoc, an attacker can displace sensors by compromising a threshold number of locators (reference points). If the coordinate system used to localize the sensor is false, the location estimation will also be false. Additionally, an adversary can displace sensors if they can selectively jam transmissions of locators. HiRLoc is not inherently resistant to jamming, but this feature can be added by employing distance bounding techniques, which come at the expense of hardware complexity, as sensors need to be equipped with clocks of nanosecond precision.

On the other hand, methods using robust statistical methods [21], [22] do not attempt to prevent specific types of attacks. They provide a robust estimate of the position of the sensors as long as the majority of the observations are benign. However, an adversary can launch attacks on specific regions of the network and corrupt the majority of the observations in those regions. For example, in a wormhole attack, the beacons replayed by the attacker provide false localization information to a specific set of sensors. If the replayed beacons outnumber the benign ones, the localization process is compromised. Statistical methods that rely on the detection of consistent subsets of information will fail to discern the replayed beacons from the valid ones and accept the replayed set of beacons as the most consistent one.

Both classes of solutions to the robust sensor localization problem are not perfectly secure against adversaries. Due to the resource-constrained nature of sensor devices, there is a tradeoff between the robustness of location estimation and the hardware and computational complexity. No single approach can prevent all types of attacks, and a multi-modal approach that considers multiple features of the sensor network is required to build a robust localization system. Finally, a formal classification of threat models and their direct relation to localization error is needed.

### Conclusion

We studied the problem of sensor localization in the presence of malicious adversaries and proposed a high-resolution, range-independent localization scheme called HiRLoc. We demonstrated that HiRLoc localizes sensors with significantly higher accuracy than previously proposed methods while requiring fewer hardware resources. Our simulation studies confirmed that varying the transmission parameters at the reference points leads to high-resolution location estimation. Furthermore, HiRLoc allows robust location computation even in the presence of security threats in WSNs, such as wormhole attacks, Sybil attacks, and the compromise of network entities.
