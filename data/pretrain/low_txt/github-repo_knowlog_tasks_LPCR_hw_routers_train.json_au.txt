    - **解释:** The memory usage was too high.
    - **优化后:** The memory is overloaded. The top three processes with the highest memory usage are [LocName]. (Memory Usage: [MemoryUsage]%, Threshold: [Threshold]%)

43. **L3VPN/2/L3V_TRAP_VRF_DOWN_active:**
    - **原始信息:** The interface bound to the VPN instance went Down. (VpnInstanceName=[VpnInstanceName], IfName=[IfName], IfCurRowStatus=[IfCurRowStatus], VRFOperationStatus=[VRFOperationStatus])
    - **解释:** Cause 1: One interface was bound with the VPN instance, and the interface status changed from Up to Down. Cause 2: Multiple interfaces were bound with the VPN instance; the status of all the interfaces changed from Up to Down; the last interface in the Up state went Down. Cause 3: The last interface with Up state is disassociated from the VPN instance.
    - **优化后:** The interface bound to the VPN instance went down. (VPN Instance Name: [VpnInstanceName], Interface Name: [IfName], Current Row Status: [IfCurRowStatus], VRF Operation Status: [VRFOperationStatus]) Possible causes:
      - One interface bound to the VPN instance changed its status from Up to Down.
      - Multiple interfaces bound to the VPN instance changed their status from Up to Down, and the last interface in the Up state went down.
      - The last interface in the Up state was disassociated from the VPN instance.

44. **WWAN/3/MODULE_UPGRADE_FAIL:**
    - **原始信息:** Module upgrade failure. (Slot=[slot-id]) This log is supported only on AR6700 series, AR8100 series.
    - **解释:** The modem fails to be upgraded.
    - **优化后:** The WWAN module upgrade failed. (Slot: [slot-id]) This log is supported only on AR6700 and AR8100 series devices.

45. **WLAN/4/STATION_ONLINE_NOTIFY:**
    - **原始信息:** OID [oid] The Station goes online. (APID=[INTEGER], Station MAC=[OCTET], AP Mac=[OCTET], RadioID=[INTEGER], Station Access Channel=[INTEGER], Station RSSI=[INTEGER], Occur Time=[OCTET])
    - **解释:** Cause 1: The STA is associated with the AP. Cause 2: The STA is reassociated with the AP.
    - **优化后:** The station went online. (AP ID: [INTEGER], Station MAC: [OCTET], AP MAC: [OCTET], Radio ID: [INTEGER], Station Access Channel: [INTEGER], Station RSSI: [INTEGER], Occurrence Time: [OCTET]) Possible causes:
      - The station (STA) is associated with the Access Point (AP).
      - The station (STA) is re-associated with the Access Point (AP).
