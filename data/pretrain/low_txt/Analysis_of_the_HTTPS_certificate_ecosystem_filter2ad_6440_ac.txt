### Identified Issues and Recommendations

While DFN has issued a significant number of intermediate authorities to German institutions, we found no evidence of inappropriate use. However, as discussed in Section 9, the attack surface of the certificate ecosystem could be significantly reduced by limiting the scope of these signing certificates.

The largest commercial provider of intermediate certificates is GTE CyberTrust Solutions, Inc., a subsidiary of Verizon Business, which has issued intermediate signing certificates to 49 third-party organizations, including Dell Inc. and Louisiana State University. Comodo (under the name The USERTRUST Network) provided intermediates to 42 organizations, and GlobalSign to 20. Additionally, several commercial authorities have issued a smaller number of certificates to seemingly unrelated entities. For example, VeriSign, Inc. provided intermediates for Oracle, Symantec, and the U.S. Government; SwissSign AG provided certificates for Nestle, Trend Micro, and other Swiss companies; StartCom Ltd. provided certificates for The City of Osmio, Inc. and WoSign, Inc.; QuoVadis Limited provided certificates for Migros and the Arab Bank Switzerland Ltd.; Entrust.net provided signing certificates to Disney, Experian PLC, and TDC Internet; and Equifax provided intermediates to Google Inc. This practice is not clandestine, and several CAs openly advertise the sale of subordinate CA certificates.

### Distribution of Trust

Approximately 30 of the 149 certificates in the Mozilla NSS root store belong to institutions that are not classified as commercial CAs, such as Visa, Wells Fargo, Deutsche Telekom AG, and the governments of France, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, Spain, and the United States.

While there are 683 organizations with the ability to sign browser-trusted certificates, the distribution is heavily skewed towards a small number of large commercial authorities, primarily in the United States. The security community has previously expressed concern over the sheer number of signing certificates, but it is also worth considering the distribution among various authorities. An increasing number of signing certificates may be a positive sign if it indicates that authorities are using new certificates to reduce the impact of compromise.

As shown in Figure 2, more than 90% of browser-trusted certificates are signed by the 10 largest commercial CAs, are descendants of just 4 root certificates, and are directly signed by 40 intermediate certificates. Several large companies have acquired many smaller, previously independent commercial CAs. For instance, Symantec owns Equifax, GeoTrust, TC TrustCenter, Thawte, and VeriSign; GoDaddy owns Starfield Technologies and ValiCert; and Comodo owns AddTrust AB, eBiz Networks, Positive Software, RegisterFly, Registry Pro, The Code Project, The USERTRUST Network, WebSpace-Forum e.K., and Wotone Communications. These consolidations allow three organizations (Symantec, GoDaddy, and Comodo) to control 75% of the browser-trusted certificates in our study. The top 10 parent organizations and the top 10 commercial CAs are listed in Tables 4 and 5, respectively.

### Historical Context and Risks

There is a long history of commercial CA compromises. In each case, web browsers and operating systems explicitly blacklisted the compromised signing certificate or misissued certificates. However, if a compromised signing certificate had signed a substantial portion of the Internet, it would be potentially infeasible to revoke it without causing significant disruption to the HTTPS ecosystem. Therefore, it is crucial that large commercial authorities distribute signing among multiple intermediate certificates. However, as seen in Figure 2, the opposite is true: more than 50% of all browser-trusted certificates have been directly signed by just 5 intermediate certificates, and a single intermediate certificate has signed over 30% of all trusted certificates.

### Figures and Tables

**Figure 1: CDF of Scan Presence by Certificate**
- We performed 36 scans from January 2013 to March 2013. This figure shows the number of scans in which each certificate was found. Over 30% of self-signed certificates were only found in one scan.

**Figure 2: CDF of Leaf Certificates by CA**
- We find that 90% of trusted certificates are signed by 5 CAs, are descendants of 4 root certificates, and were signed by 40 intermediate certificates.

**Figure 3: Validity Periods of Browser Trusted Certificates**
- Trusted CA certificates are being issued with validity periods as long as 40 years, far beyond the predicted security of the keys they contain.

**Table 3: Types of Organizations with Signing Certificates**
- We found 1,832 valid browser-trusted signing certificates belonging to 683 organizations. More than 80% of the organizations that control a signing certificate are not commercial certificate authorities.

**Table 4: Top Parent Companies**
- Major players such as Symantec, GoDaddy, and Comodo have acquired smaller CAs, leading to the 5 largest companies issuing 84.6% of all trusted certificates.

**Table 5: Top Certificate Authorities**
- The top 10 commercial certificate authorities control 92.4% of trusted certificates present in our March 22, 2013 scan.
