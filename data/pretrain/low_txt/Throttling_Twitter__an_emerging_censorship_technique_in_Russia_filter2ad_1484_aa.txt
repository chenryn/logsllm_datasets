## Abstract
In March 2021, the Russian government initiated a nationwide throttling of Twitter, marking the first large-scale, targeted use of bandwidth throttling for censorship. The slowdown was intended to pressure Twitter to comply with content removal requests from the Russian government.

This paper provides an in-depth analysis of this emerging censorship technique. We collaborated with local activists in Russia to detect and measure the throttling and reverse-engineer the throttling mechanism. Our findings indicate that the throttling is triggered by Twitter domains in the TLS SNI extension, limiting both upstream and downstream traffic to between 130 kbps and 150 kbps by dropping packets that exceed this rate. The throttling devices appear to be located close to end-users and exhibit consistent behavior across different ISPs, suggesting centralized coordination. This shift marks a departure from Russia's previously decentralized censorship model to a more centralized one, granting significant power to authorities to impose restrictions unilaterally.

Russia’s throttling of Twitter serves as a wake-up call to censorship researchers, and we aim to encourage future work in detecting and circumventing this emerging censorship technique.

## 1 Introduction
Traditional Internet censorship often involves the targeted blocking of content and resources. Censors use various network traffic features such as IP [8, 12, 13], DNS [6, 16, 30, 37], keywords [15, 36, 57], or protocol fingerprints [3, 7, 11, 56] to implement blocking. In extreme cases, censors have resorted to Internet shutdowns to completely sever connections [21, 22, 49].

While blocking is a common tool, less is known about using throttling as a means of censorship. Unlike blocking, throttling degrades the bandwidth to a service to discourage its use while still allowing some access. This makes it difficult for users and circumventors to detect or attribute the slowdown to intentional censorship, as slow connections can be mistaken for natural network congestion.

In March 2021, the Russian government began throttling Twitter on a national scale [34] to pressure the platform to comply with content removal requests [42]. While throttling entire user connections during political events has been observed, such as in Iran in 2013 [55], Russia’s selective throttling of specific domains and services is a new and emerging censorship technique. Under pressure, Twitter complied with the majority of content takedown requests without providing transparency to its users. In May 2021, Russia threatened to use the same throttling technique against Google due to disputes over anti-government content on YouTube [40].

This paper investigates and documents the Russian throttling of Twitter. Hours after the onset, we conducted measurements using multiple in-country vantage points to analyze the throttling behavior and its changes over time. We also used public crowdsourced data covering 401 unique Russian ASes to measure the impact on Internet users in Russia.

Our findings show that the throttling is triggered by observing Twitter-related domains in the SNI (Server Name Indication) extension of a TLS Client Hello record. The throttling is not symmetric and can only be triggered for TCP connections originating from within Russia. Once a connection is established, throttling can be triggered by a Twitter SNI sent in either direction. We observe that the throttling devices inspect beyond the first packet in a connection, possibly to counteract circumvention attempts. Once triggered, data packets exceeding a rate limit (around 130 kbps to 150 kbps) are dropped. TTL-limited measurements suggest that the throttling devices are placed close to end-users but are not co-located with ISP blocking devices, indicating a separate infrastructure. The throttling behaviors are consistent across different ISPs, suggesting central coordination.

Based on our measurements, we recommend several methods to circumvent the throttling, such as TCP-level fragmentation or TLS packet stuffing. We also recommend that browsers and websites support TLS Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) to make it more difficult for censors to throttle based on SNI.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze targeted throttling at a national scale. We anticipate that future censorship techniques will similarly target the degradation of service quality for sensitive domains, making this an important area of study. Current censorship detection platforms [33, 35, 50] focus on blocking and are not equipped to monitor throttling. We hope our work encourages further research in detecting and circumventing this emerging censorship technique.

## 2 Background
### Traffic Throttling
Throttling is an intentional act by an ISP or other network intermediary to reduce the allocated bandwidth to network traffic. It can be implemented through traffic shaping, which delays packets exceeding an assigned rate limit, or traffic policing, which drops the exceeding packets [9]. Throttling can be targeted, applied to specific protocols or users, or indiscriminate, applied to all traffic.

There is limited literature on traffic throttling. Kakhki et al. designed an app that uses a “Record-and-Replay” method to detect throttling for arbitrary applications on mobile networks [23]. Flach et al. developed heuristics to quantify traffic policing from server-side traces [17]. Li et al. developed a methodology and tool to identify traffic classification rules that trigger throttling from middleboxes [26, 28]. Their analysis revealed 30 ISPs in 7 countries that deployed traffic throttling mechanisms [27].

While there are instances of ISPs offering different performance for different users or services [10, 27, 59], throttling for censorship is largely unprecedented. One exception is the nationwide Internet slowdowns in Iran during periods of political upheaval [4, 14, 55], but these were not targeted and applied to all traffic. This paper investigates the first use of large-scale, targeted throttling for censorship purposes.

### Changes in Russia’s Censorship Model
Russia’s network architecture consists of thousands of ASes and numerous ISPs, similar to many other countries. As shown by Ramesh et al., unlike China and Iran, Russia uses a decentralized information control mechanism, with different ISPs implementing censorship differently, leading to fragmented access to online content [39].

Ramesh et al. showed that each ISP is responsible for the DPI systems under their control. Roskomnadzor (Russia’s authority on information control) provides a list of blocked resources, including over 100,000 domains and IPs, to be downloaded and used by each ISP’s DPI system. Many ISPs use commercially available hardware solutions, while others use open-source filtering software or develop their own.

However, our findings show a high degree of coordination across different ISPs, marking a departure from the decentralized model. This suggests that Roskomnadzor is moving towards centralized control over its decentralized network of thousands of ISPs.

## 3 Ethics
Measuring censorship events raises important ethical considerations. Most studies, including ours, measure censorship policies by actively triggering censors and observing responses, which may put participants at risk. We carefully designed our measurements to follow best practices described in Menlo reports [32] and were guided by ethical considerations from previous works [39, 52].

We used two primary data sources: 1) measurements from our in-country vantage points in Russia and 2) a crowd-sourced dataset. Before conducting any measurements, we discussed the details with the owners of the vantage points and obtained their consent. We are not aware of anyone being arrested or fined for performing this type of measurement, and we are familiar with the risks from prior research.

For the public, crowd-sourced dataset, we obtained an official determination from our US institution’s IRB as Not Regulated. We ensured the data was collected ethically. The website measures and compares client bandwidth to Twitter and a control site by sending requests and timing the downloads. Accessing Twitter was permitted in Russia even while it was throttled. The website informs users about the tests, the data collected, and links to open-sourced code. Data was bucketed into 5-minute bins to eliminate time correlation.

## 4 Throttling Twitter Incident
On March 10, 2021, Roskomnadzor announced that the government had “taken measures to protect Russian citizens from the influence of unlawful content” and began throttling Twitter due to non-compliance with content takedown requests [42]. The throttling was implemented on 100% of mobile services and 50% of landline services. On April 5, 2021, Roskomnadzor gave an ultimatum to Twitter to fulfill their requirements by May 15 to avoid complete blocking [44]. Under pressure, Twitter removed 91% of the requested prohibited content, and throttling was lifted on landlines on May 17, while it remains on mobile services [45, 46] at the time of submission. Figure 1 shows a timeline of the throttling incident.

The first reports of the throttling came from Russian activists on ntc.party, a forum for network censorship. A website was set up to collect crowd-sourced measurements by fetching an image hosted on Twitter and non-Twitter domains and comparing the performance [53]. The dataset is publicly available at [5].

Analyzing this data, we find that the throttling of Twitter in Russia is widespread. Figure 2 shows the fractions of requests throttled at the AS level. From March 11 to May 19, the website recorded 34,016 measurements from 401 unique Russian ASes, showing large slowdowns in speeds for Twitter requests.

Anecdotal reports from the Russian Internet freedom community suggest that the throttling is implemented using TSPU (технические средства противодействия угрозам, technical solution for threat countermeasures). A government official later confirmed that TSPU is a deep packet inspection (DPI) box developed by RDP.RU on Roskomnadzor’s orders [1, 51]. Unlike existing middleboxes used by individual ISPs, TSPU devices are directly controlled by Roskomnadzor [43].

Despite public and media attention, the implementation details and devices behind the throttling remained a black box. Several questions remained unanswered: How is the throttling implemented? Where in the network does it occur? What triggers the throttling? How can it be circumvented? Is the throttling stable and consistent over time?

## 5 Measurement Setup
Working with the local Internet freedom community, we secured eight local vantage points (Table 1). By comparing available bandwidth to Twitter domains with random, non-Twitter domains, we established that seven of them experienced throttling. The un-throttled vantage point served as a control for our measurements. We then set up our vantage points to follow the “record and replay” approach introduced by Kakhki et al. [23] to reverse-engineer the throttler. This technique records an un-throttled connection and replays the transcript in the tested network to infer if throttling is triggered.
