# Basic Server-Side Application Development for PostgreSQL 12
## Student’s Guide

### Setting Up the Workspace

**For Training Center Students:**
If you are taking the course at a training center, your workspace will be prepared for you.

**For Self-Study Students:**
1. **Install Virtualization Platform:**
   - Install VirtualBox 6.1 or a higher version.
   
2. **Download and Import the Virtual Machine:**
   - Download the virtual machine from [here](https://edu.postgrespro.com/DEV1-student-12-en.ova).
   - Import the downloaded `.ova` file into VirtualBox.
   - Note that the VM can only be installed on a computer with a 64-bit operating system.

3. **System Configuration:**
   - The VM runs 64-bit Xubuntu 20.04, which is pre-configured for the course.
   - Allocate at least 1 GB of RAM. For optimal performance with pgAdmin 4, increase the RAM to 1.5–2 GB.
   - Log in using the student user account (the password is the same as the username).

4. **Browser and Documentation:**
   - The Firefox browser in the VM is set up to display local documentation in English.
   - You do not need an internet connection to complete the course.

5. **File Management and Editing:**
   - Use the command line (e.g., `ls`, `pwd`, `cd`) or GUI tools (e.g., `mc`, Thunar file manager) for file management.
   - Pre-installed text editors include `vim`, `nano`, `gedit`, and `mousepad`.

### Course Handouts

**Latest Version:**
- The latest version of the course handouts is available at [this link](https://edu.postgrespro.com/DEV1-handouts-12-en.zip).

**Downloading Handouts:**
- To download the materials onto the VM, click the “Get DEV1 Handouts” icon on the Desktop or run the `get_handouts.sh` script in the Home directory of the student user.
- All files will be installed in the `dev1` directory.

**Previous Versions:**
- Previous versions of the handouts can be found at [this link](https://edu.postgrespro.com/).

**Handout Formats:**
- **HTML:** Suitable for browsing and copying code snippets.
- **PDF:** Convenient for printing.

**Content:**
- Lecture slides, demonstrations, and keys to practical assignments.

**Reference Materials:**
- **Main Functions and Data Types:** `datatypes.pdf`
- **System Catalog Tables with psql Commands:** `catalogs.pdf`
- **Basic Unix Commands:** `unix_commands.pdf`

**Command Conventions:**
- **Unix Command Prompt:**
  - `user$`: A prompt ending with a dollar sign denotes a Unix command. For example, `student$` means the command should be executed by the student user.
  - To run a command as a different user (e.g., `postgres`), use:
    ```sh
    sudo -u postgres command
    ```
  - Alternatively, open another terminal, run `sudo su postgres` once, and then execute all commands in this terminal as the `postgres` user.

- **psql Command Prompt:**
  - `=>`: An arrow prompt denotes a command entered in psql. If psql is not open, first run `psql` on behalf of the student OS user.

### Self-Study

**Study Plan:**
- Follow the topics lecture by lecture.
- In-class course videos are available at [this link](https://postgrespro.com/education/courses/DEV1).
- Course materials can be used both in conjunction with the videos and independently.
- Each lecture includes slide notes and demonstrations. Try out the commands provided in these demos.

**Practical Assignments:**
- Completing practical assignments is crucial for learning programming.
- Review the provided solutions after completing the tasks on your own, as they may contain additional information.
- The course includes a series of practical assignments based on the Bookstore sample application, covering database schema design, table creation, views, functions, and triggers.
- Complete all assignments marked with the book tag to ensure a fully functional application at the end of the course. Additional practical assignments are also recommended.

**Using Reference Materials:**
- Familiarize yourself with the main Unix commands if you are not already.
- Use the system catalog chart to understand the database structure and use psql to get descriptions of tables, views, and other objects.
- The list of main data types and functions can serve as a handy reference.

**Feedback:**
- We welcome your feedback at edu@postgrespro.ru.

Good luck, and enjoy your learning journey!
