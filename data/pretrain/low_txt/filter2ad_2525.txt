## Abstract
To protect smartphones from unauthorized access, users can activate authentication mechanisms such as PINs, passwords, or patterns. However, these mechanisms are vulnerable to shoulder-surfing, smudge, and snooping attacks. Even traditional biometric systems, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, can be bypassed. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose a behavioral biometric authentication framework that leverages the user's behavioral patterns, including touchscreen actions, keystrokes, application usage, and sensor data, to authenticate smartphone users.

We evaluated our framework through a field study involving 52 participants over a 30-day period, during which we instrumented the Android OS to collect data. We present a prototype of our framework and are currently working on selecting the best feature set to build different modalities for authenticating users in various contexts. So far, we have developed a gesture-based authentication modality, which authenticates users based on touch gestures. We evaluated this modality using approximately 3 million gesture samples, achieving an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 0.004 with a classification scheme and 0.10 with an anomaly detection scheme.

## 1. Introduction
Smartphones have become integral to our daily lives, combining personal computing features with mobility. Consequently, they store a wealth of sensitive data and personal information. To protect this data, users can enable authentication mechanisms. However, many users do not lock their smartphones due to inconvenience, lack of motivation, or awareness. For instance, 52% of 1,500 users [1] and 34% of 500 users [2] do not lock their devices. Moreover, these mechanisms are susceptible to various risks, such as shoulder-surfing and snooping attacks.

In this poster, we propose a behavioral biometric authentication framework that aims to (i) authenticate users implicitly (without interrupting their activities) and (ii) continuously (repeatedly throughout the user's session).

## 2. Related Work
Several researchers have studied current unlocking mechanisms [4], while others have proposed new techniques for smartphone authentication, including biometric [3] and implicit authentication [6]. Our work is more closely related to implicit authentication.

Unlike previous studies, which often evaluated implicit authentication techniques in constrained settings and used simple, statistically weak features, our work seeks to collect realistic behavioral data in unconstrained environments and extract a discriminative set of features.

## 3. Behavioral Biometric Framework
### 3.1 Data Collection
To build a real-world, unconstrained dataset, we developed a monitoring framework and instrumented it in the Android OS (Lollipop version on Nexus 5 device). This framework recorded events related to device unlocking, touchscreen interactions, and sensor data in real-life settings. We deployed our monitoring framework via Phonelab, a programmable smartphone testbed developed at the University at Buffalo [5].

The raw data corpus collected contains about 200 GB of smartphone user activities. Participants took part in our study between July 6, 2016, and August 31, 2016, for at least 30 days each. Out of 133 participants who installed our monitoring framework, 52 kept it for 30 days or more.

### 3.2 Behavioral Biometric Modalities
Our goal is to develop multiple modalities, but so far, we have developed only one: the gesture authentication modality. This section provides a detailed description of this modality.

### 3.3 Gesture Modality
#### 3.3.1 Gesture Analysis
To interact with the touchscreen, users enter gestures, which are hand-drawn shapes. Each gesture can consist of one or more strokes, which are sequences of consecutive timed points. Each point is represented by an ordered pair of numerical coordinates (x, y), as shown in Figure 2.

For each touched point, we collected the following raw data: timestamp, coordinates, pressure, size, and action code (e.g., touch down, touch move, touch up).

#### 3.3.2 Stroke Detection
As illustrated in Figure 2, we detect strokes based on the action code. All consecutive points between a touch down and touch up action represent a stroke S. Each point in S is characterized by its coordinates (xi, yi), pressure (pi), area (ai), and timestamp (ti), where i = {1, ..., n} and n is the total number of points in the stroke.

#### 3.3.3 Feature Extraction
We extracted features from the geometric and dynamic analysis of the stroke.

**Geometric Analysis:**
- Touch down and touch up coordinates (xdown, ydown, xup, yup)
- Stroke length (Slength)
- Stroke curvature (Scurvature)

**Dynamic Analysis:**
- Displacement (Sdisplacement)
- Velocity (V)
- Mean velocity (Smean(V))
- Maximum velocity (Smax(V))
- Acceleration (A)
- Mean acceleration (Smean(acc))

**Temporal Features:**
- Duration (Sduration)
- Inter-stroke duration (Sinterduration)

**Pressure and Size Features:**
- Touch down and touch up pressure (SpDown, SpUp)
- Average, maximum, and minimum pressure (SpAverage, SpMin, SpMax)
- Touch down and touch up size (SsDown, SsUp)
- Average, maximum, and minimum size (SsAverage, SsMin, SsMax)

#### 3.3.4 Modeling and Evaluation
We used two models to authenticate users: a classification model and an anomaly detection model.

**Classification Model:**
- Trained on data from both legitimate users and imposters.
- Used k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier with a one-vs-all scheme.
- Achieved EER 0.004 with AUC 0.99 (Figure 3a).

**Anomaly Detection Model:**
- Trained on data from legitimate users only.
- Used the lsanomaly learning algorithm [7].
- Achieved EER 0.10 with AUC 0.91 (Figure 3b).

**Validation Method:**
- Dataset separated into training and testing sets.
- Performed 10-fold cross-validation.

**Performance Metric:**
- Evaluated using ROC curves, which depict the trade-off between True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR).
- The top left corner of the ROC curve represents the ideal point (TPR = 1, FPR = 0).

### 3.4 Decision Fusion
Although we have developed only one modality, our future work will focus on leveraging different data sources to develop multiple authentication modalities. Each modality will have specific strengths in different contexts, and we will explore fusion scenarios to use these modalities complementarily.

## 4. Conclusions and Future Work
We conducted a field study on Android phone users, collecting data related to user behavioral activities. We are developing a multimodal behavioral biometric authentication framework to authenticate smartphone users in different contexts. Currently, we have implemented a gesture authentication modality. Future work will focus on developing other modalities based on keystroke and behavioral profiling biometric traits.
