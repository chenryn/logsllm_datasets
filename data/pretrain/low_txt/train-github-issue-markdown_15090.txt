### Superset Version
0.25.5

### Expected Results
I need to set a default value in a filter box that will filter non-immune slices on the dashboard to which the filter box is added. I am aware that there is an option to set a filter in the filter box and then save the dashboard, which retains the filtering when selected. However, this option does not work when the filter choices in the filter box may differ for each user. There is currently no property in the filter box slice builder to set a default value.

I have considered adding a new property in `formData` in `Dashboard.jsx`, which could be used in `utils.py` when the query is created, similar to how `extra_filters` works. However, I have not found a way to enforce the use of this "default_filter" only for the first time the dashboard is selected. For the default value, I would like to use the first value in the list of filter choices.

I was able to set a default value in the filter box by changing the `value` property in `OnPasteSelect` in `filter_box.jsx`. However, this change does not propagate to the other slices on the dashboard, making it ineffective.

Is there a way to detect when a dashboard is initially selected by a user? Can setting a default value in the filter box be added as a new property, perhaps picked up by `extra_filters`?

Any thoughts or ideas would be greatly appreciated.
