### Apache Configuration and Usage

- **Configuration File Location:**
  - The configuration file for Apache is located at `/opt/apache2/conf/httpd.conf`. Apple has modified this file to run the `httpd` processes as user and group `www`.

- **WebDAV Compatibility:**
  - When enabling WebDAV with Apache 2, note that clients using Mac OS X or Mac OS X Server version 10.1 will only have read-only access to Apache2 WebDAV volumes. Clients using version 10.2 or later will not have this limitation.

- **Starting Apache:**
  - To start Apache, use the command: 
    ```sh
    sudo /opt/apache2/bin/apachectl start
    ```

- **Running Multiple Apache Versions:**
  - While it is possible to run both versions of Apache, caution is advised. Ensure that both versions do not attempt to listen on the same port (e.g., port 80). You can modify the `Listen` directive in `/opt/apache2/conf/httpd.conf` or use the web section of Server Admin to change the port for your virtual hosts. Additionally, if the web performance cache is enabled, it may be the process listening on port 80.

### JBoss Application Server

- **Overview:**
  - JBoss is an open-source application server designed for J2EE applications, running on Java 1.4.1. It provides a full J2EE technology stack, including:
    - Enterprise Java Bean (EJB) container
    - Java Management Extensions (JMX)
    - Java Connector Architecture (JCA)

- **Default Web Container:**
  - By default, JBoss uses Tomcat as its web container, but you can configure it to use other containers like Jetty.

- **Management Tools:**
  - Use the Application Server section of Server Admin and command-line tools in the Terminal application to manage JBoss. Server Admin ensures continuous availability of JBoss once started.
  - Two web-based tools for JBoss management and application deployment are available at `/Library/JBoss/Application`.

- **Documentation:**
  - For detailed information, refer to:
    - Java application server administration guide
    - Java enterprise applications guide
  - Additional resources:
    - [JBoss Official Website](https://www.jboss.org/)
    - [J2EE Documentation](https://java.sun.com/j2ee/)

- **Starting and Stopping JBoss:**
  - In Server Admin, go to the Application Server section, select the desired server, click Settings, and choose the appropriate JBoss option to start or stop the service.

- **Changing JBoss Configuration:**
  - In Server Admin, go to the Application Server section, click Settings, and either load a remote configuration or use a local configuration.

- **Backup and Restore:**
  - Use the Application Server section of Server Admin to back up and restore JBoss configurations.

### Tomcat Servlet Container

- **Overview:**
  - Tomcat is the official reference implementation for Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSP) technologies. The current production series is Tomcat 4.1.x, implementing Java Servlet 2.3 and JSP 1.2 specifications.

- **Management:**
  - Use the Application Server section of Server Admin to manage Tomcat. Once started, Tomcat's lifecycle is managed by Server Admin, ensuring automatic startup after power failures or server shutdowns.

- **Starting Tomcat:**
  - Using Server Admin:
    - Go to the Application Server section, select the desired server, click Settings, and choose "Tomcat Only" to start the service.
  - Using Terminal:
    ```sh
    cd /Library/Tomcat/bin
    ./catalina.sh start
    ```
  - Verify Tomcat is running by accessing `http://yourwebsite:9006`.

### MySQL Database

- **Overview:**
  - MySQL is a relational database management system preinstalled on Mac OS X Server. Use the MySQL Manager application to set up and manage the MySQL database.

- **Installation and Upgrade:**
  - Mac OS X Server includes the latest version of MySQL. If you install a newer version, it should reside in `/usr/local/mysql`. Ensure you do not run both versions simultaneously.
  - For more information, visit [MySQL Official Website](https://www.mysql.com/).

- **Updating from Previous Versions:**
  - If upgrading from Mac OS X Server 10.x, back up your databases before updating. Use commands like `mysql_fix_privilege_tables` and `mysql_convert_table_format` to update table formats.

### Web Modules

- **Apache Modules:**
  - Apache modules add functionality to the web server. Standard and third-party modules can be found at [Apache Modules Documentation](https://www.apache.org/docs/mod/).
  - To enable or install modules, use the Web section of Server Admin.

- **Macintosh-Specific Modules:**
  - These include `mod_macbinary_apple`, `mod_sherlock_apple`, `mod_auth_apple`, `mod_hfs_apple`, `mod_digest_apple`, and `mod_rendezvous_apple`.

- **Open-Source Modules:**
  - Popular open-source modules include Tomcat, PHP, and mod_perl. For more information, refer to their respective websites.

### Troubleshooting

- **Users Canâ€™t Connect:**
  - Ensure web service is on, check logs, verify URLs, and ensure correct folder and document settings. Check network and DNS configurations.

- **Module Not Working:**
  - Check error logs, module documentation, and compatibility.

- **CGI Not Running:**
  - Verify file permissions and ensure the CGI script is executable by the `www` user.
