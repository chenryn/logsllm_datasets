### 6. Maximizing System Performability

In the previous sections, we have demonstrated how to calculate performance and availability for various system configurations given a fixed budget. This provides customers with a range of options, such as an availability/performance point on one of the curves shown in Figures 2-4. To help customers decide among these options, it is useful to define a single availability/performance metric. In other words, we need a metric for performability [7], defined as a composite measure of a system's performance and its dependability.

For the purposes of this paper, we selected a simple performability metric called "available PetaFLOPS," defined as:

\[ \text{Available PetaFLOPS} = \text{Application Availability} \times \text{Peak PetaFLOPS} \]

Available PetaFLOPS measures the amount of computing a system could actually perform after accounting for failure recovery. For example, the system configuration options from Table 3 have an available PetaFLOPS value of 0.75 (75% application availability × 1 peak PetaFLOPS) for the original system and 0.8 (86% application availability × 0.93 peak PetaFLOPS) with the fifth memory channel. In this case, the fifth memory channel option would be preferred because it has higher available PetaFLOPS, even though it has lower peak PetaFLOPS. From Table 4, the available PetaFLOPS for a system with a RAM checkpoint is 0.71 (92% application availability × 0.77 peak PetaFLOPS). Using this performability metric, this option would not be preferred over either of the others.

The available PetaFLOPS metric could be improved by using a better measure of performance, such as performance on a benchmark suite or some kind of utility function, rather than just peak PetaFLOPS. Nevertheless, the simple metric is useful for illustrating cost/benefit trade-offs between performance and availability.

Figures 2, 3, and 4 showed the trade-off between performance and availability as a function of disk bandwidth. Figures 5, 6, and 7 show the available PetaFLOPS metric using the values from Figures 2-4.

- **Figure 5:** As disk bandwidth increased, application availability initially increases faster than performance decreases. Eventually, however, the performance decrease outweighs the availability increase, yielding the optimal value of 0.767 available PetaFLOPS at 1.2 TB/sec disk bandwidth.
- **Figure 6:** Similar to Figure 5, with an optimal value of 0.775 available PetaFLOPS at 1.15 TB/sec disk bandwidth.
- **Figure 7:** The optimal value occurs when disk bandwidth is reduced rather than increased from its initial value. With a RAM checkpoint and an initial value of 1 TB/sec disk bandwidth, the improvement due to increased disk bandwidth has less impact on performability than the performance improvement achieved with more compute power and less disk bandwidth. The optimal value of 0.7 available PetaFLOPS occurs at 0.89 TB/sec disk bandwidth.

### 7. Summary

This paper describes RAS "by the yard" - the architectural flexibility that allows customers to purchase a range of RAS for different prices. It shows how to analyze the cost vs. RAS vs. performance trade-offs for a system defined by a set of system balance ratios. In particular, it shows how to rebalance the system to accommodate RAS features when the system procurement budget is fixed. Using a performability metric, available PetaFLOPS, system optimization is demonstrated. The system resulting from the optimization provides the best combination of RAS and performance for a fixed cost.

The performability metric, available PetaFLOPS, described in this paper does not fully capture all the subtleties of computer RAS. Treating performability as linear in performance and availability does not account for all the benefits of improved RAS. Better RAS means decreased administration and maintenance costs and higher user satisfaction. At some point, supercomputer users and administrators can stop waiting anxiously after submitting a job to see if it will finish. They can do useful work while trusting the supercomputer to complete the job, even in the presence of failures. The determination of a performability metric that appropriately accounts for productivity is the subject of future research.
