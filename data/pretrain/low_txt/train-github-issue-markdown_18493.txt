After installing the latest update (Version 0.10.1, Commit `df35236`, Shell 0.34.1, Render 45.0.2454.85, Node 4.1.1), I encountered an issue where pasting text into a new file causes the entire screen to freeze. Only the menu bar remains responsive, but it does not function properly. This problem occurs on Windows 8.1.
