# IPTV User Activity Analysis and Workload Generation

## 1. Introduction
This paper presents an in-depth analysis of user activities in large-scale IPTV systems, including the durations of on-, off-, and channel-sessions, time-varying rates of switching events, and channel popularity. We have developed practical mathematical models to capture these characteristics and constructed SIMULWATCH, a tool for generating synthetic yet realistic activity traces of a large number of IPTV users.

## 2. Results and Discussion

### 2.1 Number of Online STBs Over Time
**Figure 17: Number of Online STBs Over Time**
- The figure shows the number of online Set-Top Boxes (STBs) over a 24-hour period.
- Both the real trace and synthetic trace results closely match, indicating the accuracy of our model.

### 2.2 Multi-Class Population Model
**Figure 18: Multi-Class Population Model Captures Channel Popularity Dynamics**
- This figure illustrates how the multi-class population model captures the changes in channel popularity over time.
- The single-class population model treats every channel-switch event uniformly, leading to a proportional relationship between the changing rate of channel popularity and the changing rate of online STB population.

### 2.3 Factors Affecting Channel Popularity
- **Channel Access Probability:** Defined as the number of STBs in a particular population watching a specific channel divided by the number of online STBs in that population at a given time period.
- **Population Mix:** Consists of the proportions of different subgroups in the whole user population.
- The dynamics of channel popularity are generated by the combined effect of these two factors.

### 2.4 Channel Access Probability
**Figure 19: Time-of-Day Dynamics for a Popular Kids Channel**
- The figure displays the channel access probability for a popular kids channel, showing one curve for each group and an additional curve for all STBs.
- The diurnal pattern observed in the all-watchers curve is not present in the other curves, indicating that the change in channel access probability within each group is minimal.

### 2.5 Population Mix
**Figure 20: Population Mix for Each Group**
- This figure illustrates the population mix in our synthetic trace.
- The increase in the light-watcher group during certain hours (approximately 5:00 – 14:00) contributes to the spike in channel popularity.

### 2.6 Case Study: Bandwidth Requirement for Fast-Channel-Switch
**Figure 21: Case Study - Simultaneous Unicast Stream Count and Active Multicast Channel Count**
- We evaluate the bandwidth requirement to support fast-channel-switch using SIMULWATCH.
- The results from both the real trace and synthetic trace closely match, demonstrating the tool's effectiveness in preserving intrinsic user activity characteristics.

## 3. Related Work
- Traditional methods for understanding TV viewing activities relied on phone surveys or specialized monitoring boxes, which were difficult to scale.
- Recent studies have focused on various aspects of IPTV systems, but our work uniquely models user activities and designs a workload generator.
- Other researchers have investigated user activity workloads in media streaming and Video-on-Demand (VoD) systems, providing complementary insights.

## 4. Conclusion
- We have performed an in-depth analysis of user activities in large IPTV systems and developed practical mathematical models to capture these characteristics.
- SIMULWATCH, our user activity workload generation tool, has been validated using real traces from a large nationwide IPTV provider in the United States.
- Future work includes extending the model to include advanced IPTV features and analyzing the impact of new features on system performance.
