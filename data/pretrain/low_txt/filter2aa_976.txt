# Who Cares About IPv6?

**Author:** Sam Bowne

## Part I: Who Cares?

### IPv4 Addresses: 32 Bits
- **IPv4 Address Example:** 192.168.1.10
- **Format:** Four bytes
- **Binary Representation:**
  - 11000000 10101000 00000001 00001010
- **Total Addresses:** 2^32 (approximately 4 billion)
- **Insufficiency:** With 7 billion people, each needing multiple devices (i.e., iPads, cell phones, Google brain chip implants, etc.), the 4 billion addresses are insufficient.

### IPv6 Addresses: 128 Bits
- **IPv6 Address Example:** 2001:05c0:1000:000b:0000:0000:0000:66fb
- **Omitting Unnecessary Zeroes:** 2001:5c0:1000:b::66fb
- **Format:** Eight fields, each 16 bits long (4 hexadecimal characters)
- **Total Addresses:** 2^128 (approximately 340 undecillion, or 340 billion billion billion billion)
- **Sufficiency:** More than enough for the foreseeable future.

### IPv4 Exhaustion
- **As of June 30, 2010:**
  - 16 "/8 address ranges" remain
  - Each /8 has 16.8 million addresses
  - 205 /8s already allocated
  - 35 reserved for special uses
- **Consequences:**
  - No reprieve; IANA will not re-purpose class D or E addresses for general use.
  - People requesting IPv4 addresses after exhaustion will be denied.
  - Hoarding, scalping, and direct sales of IPv4 addresses will begin.

### Federal IPv6 Transition Timeline
- **Source:** Cisco (refer to Defcon-talk 2)

### Summary of Part I
- **Key Point:** IPv4 is full, and a transition to IPv6 is necessary.

## Part II: What Now?

### Methods of IPv6 Migration
1. **Ignore IPv6:** Stay on IPv4-only.
2. **Gateways:** Devices that convert IPv6 to IPv4.
3. **Tunnel IPv6 over IPv4.**
4. **Dual-Stack:** Use both IPv4 and IPv6 together.
5. **Nirvana:** Move to IPv6-only.

### IPv6 Tunnels
- **Advantages:**
  - Fast and easy to set up, best for beginners.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Not ideal for security or performance.
- **Free IPv4-to-IPv6 Tunnels:**
  - Gogo6.com
  - Sixxs.net
  - Tunnelbroker.com
- **References:** Defcon-talk 5-7

### GoGo6
- **Description:** The easiest method for setting up IPv6 tunnels.
- **Demonstration:** Refer to Defcon-talk 5-7.

### IPv6 Certifications
- **Fun and Realistic Projects:**
  - He.net
- **Reference:** Defcon-talk 12

## Part III: Security Problems

### Privacy Risk
- **Issue:** Anyone with your IP address also has your MAC address.
- **Solution:** "Privacy Extensions" technique, enabled by default in Vista and Windows 7.

### ICMPv6
- **Requirements:**
  - Required for all networks.
  - Cannot be blocked.
  - Replaces ARP.
  - "Neighbor Discovery" is trivial.

### THC-IPv6
- **Description:** Hacker's Toolkit.
- **Compatibility:** Runs well on Ubuntu, even in VMware on Windows 7.
- **Instructions:** Refer to Defcon-talk 8.

### Other Risks
- **Security Appliances:**
  - Many are not ready for IPv6, allowing it to bypass them.
  - Torrents can run over IPv6.
  - Some VPN appliances are not ready, so IPv6 connections must bypass them.
- **Packet Amplification Attacks:**
  - Routing Header Zero
  - Ping-pong
