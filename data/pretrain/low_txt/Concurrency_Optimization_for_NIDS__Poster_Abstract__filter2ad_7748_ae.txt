#### 6B: Integrated Analysis of Metabolomics and Microbiome Data Showing Additional Dietary Effects
- **Time:** 2:00 p.m. – 2:20 p.m.
- **Presenting Author:** Jildau Bouwman, TNO, Netherlands
- **Co-Authors:** Femke Hoevenaars, Everton Souto Lima, Lydia Afman, Martin Beaumont, François Blachier, Sandrine Claus, Annick Hartstra, Louise Kjølbæk, Lesli Hingstrup Larsen, Max Nieuwdorp, Yolanda Sanz, Hans Schött, Kevin Portune, Alfonso Benítez, Bart Keijser, Ben van Ommen

**Abstract:**
The prevalence of lifestyle-related diseases has been increasing since the 1970s, and disease prevention through the improvement of human health is gaining more attention. The microbiome is a critical new target in these approaches, as it influences the metabolism of nutrients and thereby affects host physiology. However, there is a general lack of understanding regarding the role of the gut microbiome in health and well-being.

Within the MyNewGut project, research is being conducted on the gut microbiome and its relationship to dietary interventions. By integrating data from various MyNewGut studies, we aim to expand our understanding of diet-microbiome-host interactions. Clinical, NMR, and microbiome data from five different dietary intervention studies were integrated. First, all measured parameters (clinical, LC-MS, NMR, and microbiome) were aligned to discover overlaps between studies. Next, overlapping parameters were selected for further integration. Workflows were developed to align and integrate NMR and microbiome data from the different studies.

Our results show that butyrate/FT and fiber/PUFA improve metabolism, while a high-protein intervention leads to less healthy metabolic outcomes. Traditionally, microbiome, LC-MS, and NMR data are evaluated separately. Integrating these datasets into a model that visualizes treatment effects is useful for detecting new diet-microbiome-host interactions.

#### 6C: Quantitative Dietary Fingerprinting (QDF)—A Novel Tool for Comprehensive Dietary Assessment Based on Urinary Nutrimetabolomics
- **Time:** 2:20 p.m. – 2:35 p.m.
- **Presenting Author:** Raúl González-Domínguez, Biomarkers and Nutrimetabolomics Laboratory, University of Barcelona, Spain
- **Co-Authors:** Raúl González-Domínguez, Mireia Urpi-Sarda, Olga Jáuregui, Paul W. Needs, Paul A. Kroon, Cristina Andrés-Lacueva

**Abstract:**
Accurate dietary assessment is a significant challenge in nutritional research, requiring powerful and robust tools for reliable measurement of food intake and monitoring dietary habits. To address this, we optimized a novel Quantitative Dietary Fingerprinting (QDF) approach, combining solid-phase extraction with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). This method was validated for the quantitation of approximately 350 biomarkers, including (poly)phenolic aglycones, phase II metabolites, microbial-transformed compounds, and other dietary components.

The complex urinary food metabolome was simultaneously extracted using Oasis HLB solid-phase extraction plates. To improve the recovery of sulfate conjugates, ammonium formate was added to elution solvents. Chromatographic separation was achieved by reversed-phase UHPLC in very short run times, facilitating the application of the method to large sample sizes. Tandem mass spectrometry, using multiple reaction monitoring acquisition mode, enabled the selective and sensitive detection of these 350 dietary markers at concentrations typically found in real urine samples.

The applicability of this QDF method was assessed by analyzing urine samples collected after acute dietary interventions with various foods, including orange, apple, grapefruit, red wine, beer, coffee, green tea, soy, walnuts, and wholegrain bread. The optimized methodology presents a significant potential for assessing dietary patterns through high-throughput analysis of the urinary metabolomic pattern.

#### 6D: Grass, Beef, and Human. Unlocking the Value of the Food Chain in New Zealand
- **Time:** 2:35 p.m. – 2:55 p.m.
- **Presenting Author:** Arvind Subbaraj, AgResearch Ltd., New Zealand

**Abstract:**
We recently published the ryegrass metabolome and a chemotaxonomic classification of 715 ryegrass genotypes, representing 118 populations from 21 different countries. Ryegrass is integral to temperate pastoral agriculture, which contributes significantly to global meat and milk production. Pasture-fed beef is claimed to have several health benefits compared to grain-fed counterparts. Lipids, particularly phospholipids, are central to this debate.

We conducted a non-targeted lipidomics analysis of 38 different cuts of pasture-fed Wagyu to account for differences in the lipid profile across the beef carcass. Ten cuts with high phospholipid content were identified, and the effects of breed (Wagyu vs. Angus) and feed (pasture vs. grain) were evaluated in a separate study. No significant differences in phospholipid content were observed between pasture-fed Wagyu and Angus. However, phospholipids were present in higher concentrations in pasture-fed compared to grain-fed Wagyu beef.

Currently, an eight-week dietary intervention study is underway to track the effect of consuming pasture-fed Wagyu beef, grain-fed beef, and a vegetable-based meat alternative on circulating lipids and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk in humans. A non-targeted lipidomics analysis of blood plasma will be conducted. This talk will summarize recent metabolomics studies in New Zealand to elucidate and decipher the critical components of the food chain from grass and animal to human consumption. Missing links in our understanding, such as the rumen metabolome, will be discussed.

#### 6E: NMR Metabolomics Revealed Different Impact of Non-Acylated and Acylated Anthocyanins on Plasma Metabolic Profiles in Obese Diabetic Zucker Rats
- **Time:** 2:55 p.m. – 3:10 p.m.
- **Presenting Author:** Kang Chen, University of Turku, Finland
- **Co-Authors:** Xuetao Wei, Raghunath Paryjani, Maaria Kortesniemi, Jari Heinonen, Yumei Zhang, Jian Zhang, Tuomo Vainio, Kaisa Linderborg, Baoru Yang

**Abstract:**
Anthocyanins, present in food as non-acylated (NAAs) and acylated (AAs), are known for their potent anti-diabetic properties. AAs have higher stability, antioxidant activity, and bioavailability compared to NAAs. Currently, no research has compared the effects of these two forms of anthocyanins on the metabolic profile of diabetic models.

In this study, we aimed to compare the modulatory effects of NAAs (from bilberry) and AAs (from purple potato) on metabolic changes in obese Zucker diabetic rats (fa/fa). Experimental rats were fed with NAAs and AAs at two doses for 8 weeks. 1H NMR metabolomics was used to reveal changes in plasma metabolites. NAAs supplementation reduced plasma glucose levels, but a similar effect was not observed in the group fed with AAs. All treatment groups decreased levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and improved lipid profiles, although no significance was found in the group fed with NAAs at the low dose.

AAs-fed groups showed improved insulin secretion and sensitivity, indicated by the positive change in the glutamine/glutamate ratio. In AAs-fed groups, decreased levels of lactate, serine, threonine, and glycine might be associated with improved oxidative status and a shift in energy production from glycolysis and the TCA cycle towards lipid catabolism. Our data demonstrate that NAAs improved glucose levels through modulating insulin resistance and lipid profiles. AAs reversed most of the changed levels of metabolites in type 2 diabetes to the normal state by modifying insulin resistance and secretion, oxidative stress, energy production, and lipid profiles.

### Session 7: Flux Studies
**Tuesday, June 25, 1:30 p.m. – 3:15 p.m.**

#### 7A: Session Keynote
- **Time:** 1:30 p.m. – 2:00 p.m.
- **Title:** A Systems Medicine Approach to Identify New Drug Targets: Model-Driven Discovery of Metabolic Reprogramming in Metastatic Prostate Cancer
- **Presenting Author:** Marta Cascante, University of Barcelona, Spain
- **Co-Authors:** Cristina Balcells, Igor Marin de Mas, Esther Aguilar, Erika Zodda, Pedro de Atauri, Josep J. Centelles, Balázs Papp, Francesc Mas, Timothy Thomson, Silvia Marin, Marta Cascante

**Abstract:**
Tumors harbor combinations of heterogeneous neoplastic cells. In this complex ecosystem, all modalities of mutual cell interactions can take place within the context of environmental cues that exert selective pressures. Despite the underlying heterogeneity, two broad operational categories of neoplastic cells, cancer stem cells (CSCs) and non-CSCs, are most relevant to the survival under stress and metastatic colonization.

Using a dual model of two clonal subpopulations isolated from an established prostate cancer cell line (PC-3), we applied a systems biology approach, including experimental data integration into genome-scale metabolic models, to unveil metabolic differences and potential vulnerabilities to be exploited as putative drug targets. The dual model consists of a CSC-subpopulation (PC-3M, high metastatic potential, and low invasiveness) and a non-CSC-subpopulation (PC-3S, expressing EMT markers with high invasiveness and low metastatic potential).

Results show that EMT and metastasis programs display different metabolic traits. The main differences observed were in the differential use of glucose and glutamine to fuel the TCA cycle, mitochondrial respiration, one-carbon metabolism, beta-oxidation, and eicosanoids metabolism. We applied the same approach to identify the metabolic reprogramming associated with platinum resistance and identified metabolic alterations emerging from platinum resistance to be used in combined drug therapies.

#### 7B: Using Stable-Isotope Labelled Metabolomics to Explore Cell-Cell Communication Between Malaria Parasites and Host Cells
- **Time:** 2:00 p.m. – 2:20 p.m.
- **Presenting Author:** Darren Creek, Monash University, Australia
- **Co-Authors:** Anna Sexton, Christian Doerig, Teresa Carvalho

**Abstract:**
Malaria is caused by the infection of host red blood cells (RBCs) with the Plasmodium parasite, leading to clinical symptoms such as fever, anemia, and metabolic acidosis. Characterizing the interplay between host and parasite factors is critical for understanding the molecular basis of these symptoms. While RBCs are essential for the lifecycle of P. falciparum, biochemical changes in uninfected, bystander RBCs have not been studied in detail.

We performed an untargeted metabolomics study to investigate metabolic changes in uninfected RBCs when exposed to media from P. falciparum culture ("conditioned RBCs"). We observed significant perturbations to central carbon metabolism in conditioned RBCs. Stable isotope labeled U-13C-glucose was used as a carbon source to differentiate active RBC metabolism from parasite-derived metabolites, showing that flux through glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway was significantly perturbed in conditioned RBCs. Notably, the level of U-13C-lactate secreted by conditioned RBCs was higher than control cells, indicating increased glycolytic flux.

To identify factors driving this effect, P. falciparum culture medium was filtered (to remove protein and extracellular vesicles) and incubated with RBCs. Metabolomic analysis showed that the remaining parasite small molecules, alone, were capable of inducing metabolic perturbations in RBCs. Metabolomic profiling of media from P. falciparum cultures provided a candidate list of small molecules that may be responsible. These data demonstrate the modulation of RBC metabolism by P. falciparum, which may contribute to the metabolic symptoms of clinical infection.

#### 7C: Using Deuterium Labelled Glucose to Quantify Redox Metabolism in Plants
- **Time:** 2:20 p.m. – 2:35 p.m.
- **Presenting Author:** Edward Smith, University of Oxford, United Kingdom
- **Co-Authors:** James S O McCullagh, R George Ratcliffe, Nicholas J Kruger

**Abstract:**
A complete picture of plant metabolism is essential for understanding plant productivity and successful metabolic engineering. However, a lack of quantitative information about sources of metabolic reductant limits the ability to engineer plants to exploit desirable traits. NADPH is the primary source of cellular reductant, required for biosynthesis and protection against oxidative stress. While the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway represents the most direct route for NADPH production from sugars, there is increasing evidence that other pathways make significant contributions to redox balance.

Deuterium-based isotopic tracers have recently been developed to quantify the production of NADPH from different pathways in mammalian cells, but their application to plants has not been explored. In this study, LC-MS was used to measure deuterium incorporation into metabolites extracted from heterotrophic Arabidopsis cell cultures grown on [1-²H]glucose or ²H₂O. The results highlight features of plant metabolism that can confound analysis, such as the interconnectivity of the plant metabolic network, the duplication of pathways in subcellular compartments, and the high abundance of enzymes that can catalyze the loss of isotopic label to solvent. Understanding these features is a prerequisite for developing more effective strategies for flux determination in plant metabolism and ensuring data are both quantitative and representative of biological processes in vivo.

#### 7D: Modelling Cancer Lipogenesis Using REIMS Metabolic Flux Analysis in Breast Cancer Cell Lines
- **Time:** 2:35 p.m. – 2:55 p.m.
- **Presenting Author:** Seyma Turkseven, Imperial College London, United Kingdom
- **Co-Authors:** Alvaro Perdones-Montero, Simon Cameron, Nikolaos Koundouros, George Poulogiannis, Zoltan Takats

**Abstract:**
Rapid evaporative ionisation mass spectrometry (REIMS) offers a novel opportunity for understanding the alterations in lipid metabolism that play an important role during cancer progression. REIMS is an ambient technique that allows sample analysis without preparative steps, which could alter the chemical composition of the sample. Here, REIMS was utilized to monitor metabolic flux during cell proliferation using U-13C-labelled palmitic acid to provide a tracer for lipogenesis in in vitro studies.

For labeling experiments, SKBR3, MCF7, and MCF10A cells were seeded into culture dishes using DMEM and DMEM/F12 and then changed to a fatty acid-free BSA media overnight. Following this, cells were treated with [U-13C]-palmitic acid under normoxic conditions for 6 hours, detached using a cell scraper, and analyzed using REIMS with a CO2 laser for sample heating. The ratio of the labelled palmitate taken up by cells to the production of unlabelled palmitate through de novo lipogenesis showed a similarity in cancer cells and non-tumorigenic cells. However, palmitic acid incorporation into complex lipids resulted in specific lipidomic profiles for the different breast cancer cell lines.

The detected labelled phospholipids after the supplementation of cells with the nutrient might help to further interpret the lipid signaling process, as the cancer cell lines were related to PI3K/Akt/mTOR-mediated regulation of cell functions. This study demonstrates the applicability of LA-REIMS for the characterization of metabolic flux experiments using labelled metabolites in human cell lines, with wider applications to metabolic flux analysis.

#### 7E: Exploring the Use of GC-CI-MS for Stable Isotope Labeling in Metabolomics
- **Time:** 2:55 p.m. – 3:10 p.m.
- **Presenting Author:** Jordi Capellades Tomàs, IISPV, Spain
- **Co-Authors:** Alexandra Junza, Oscar Yanes

**Abstract:**
Isotopic labeling experiments have been incredibly valuable for monitoring metabolic reactions in biological systems, crucial for understanding homeostasis alterations in disease. Experimental determination of metabolic fluxes can be inferred from a characteristic rearrangement of stable isotope tracers (e.g., 13C or 15N) detected by mass spectrometry. Metabolites measured are generally members of well-known metabolic pathways and can be detected by both gas chromatography (GC) coupled to electron ionization (EI) MS and liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to electrospray (ESI) MS approaches.

Here, we show that GC methods coupled to chemical ionization (CI) MS have a clear advantage over alternative methodologies due to GC's superior chromatographic separation efficiency and the fact that CI is a soft ionization technique yielding identifiable protonated molecular ion peaks. We tested diverse GC-CI-MS setups, including methane and isobutane reagent gases, triple quadrupole (QqQ) MS in SIM mode, or monitoring selected ion clusters using optimized narrow windows (~10 Da) in scan mode, and standard full-scan methods using high-resolution GC-TOF and GC-Orbitrap systems. The GC-Orbitrap MS in full-scan mode showed the best performance, enabling precise detection of isotopologues in most metabolic intermediates of central carbon metabolism.

Finally, to overcome manual operations, we developed an R-based tool called IsoScan that automatically quantifies all isotopologues of intermediate metabolites of glycolysis, TCA cycle, amino acids, pentose phosphate pathway, and urea cycle.

### Session 9: Epidemiology
**Tuesday, June 25, 3:45 p.m. – 5:30 p.m.**

#### 9A: Session Keynote
- **Time:** 3:45 p.m. – 4:15 p.m.
- **Title:** Integrating Metabolomics with Genomics, Proteomics, and Other Omics for Health and Drug Research
- **Presenting Author:** Karsten Suhre, Weill Cornell Medicine - Qatar, Qatar

**Abstract:**
Deep molecular phenotyping of population-based studies allows for the investigation of disease-relevant biological pathways by studying their natural variation in large numbers of individuals. Genome-wide association studies with metabolic endpoints have already revealed hundreds of genetically influenced metabotypes that define human metabolic individuality. Recently, these large-scale omics studies have been extended by including proteomics and other omics phenotypes, and by linking these multi-omics readouts to epigenetic regulation.

In this keynote, I will review recent developments in the field and discuss potential applications for health and drug research from a precision medicine perspective.

#### 9B: Application of 1H NMR Metabolomics in ~7,000 People to Investigate Potential Molecular Mechanisms of Genetic Risk Variants for Coronary Artery Diseases
- **Time:** 4:15 p.m. – 4:35 p.m.
- **Presenting Author:** Ibrahim Karaman, Imperial College London, United Kingdom
- **Co-Authors:** Gonçalo Graça, Claire Boulangé, Rui Climaco Pinto, Georgia Saylor, Eliana Portilla, He Gao, Nicholette Palmer, Timothy Howard, Chunhong Mao, Donald Bowden, Arfan Ikram, Abbas Dehghan, Ioanna Tzoulaki, Timothy Ebbels, Paul Elliott, David Herrington

**Abstract:**
Numerous common genetic variants have been identified for association with the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). For the vast majority, the molecular mechanisms leading to the disease phenotype are not well understood or are completely unknown. We conducted untargeted and targeted 1H NMR metabolomics to characterize the metabolomic signatures associated with the risk variants to generate new knowledge about possible mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of CAD.

Both CPMG and conventional 1D 1H NMR spectra acquired from serum of participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA, N=~4,000), the Rotterdam Study (RS, N=~2,000), and the Airwave Health Monitoring Study (Airwave, N=3,000) were used in the untargeted metabolomics analysis. For targeted analysis, we used Bruker Lipoprotein Subclass Analysis (B.I.-LISA) in MESA and Airwave cohorts. The current analyses included 7,141 individuals for CPMG, 7,149 for 1D NMR, and 5,794 for B.I.-LISA data. We found that variants in 37 loci out of 365 reported loci for CAD were associated with metabolites at the 1% metabolome-wide significance level. These metabolites mainly originated from lipoprotein subclasses, lipids from several lipoprotein particles, and several amino acids potentially involved in protein synthesis. This information could produce new knowledge on the causal pathways linking genes to cardiovascular diseases and identify novel preventive targets.

#### 9C: Untargeted Metabolomics in a Prospective Cohort to Identify Diet-Related Metabolites Associated with Age-Related Cognitive Decline
- **Time:** 4:35 p.m. – 4:50 p.m.
- **Presenting Author:** Dorrain Low, Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore
- **Co-Authors:** Sophie Lefèvre-Arbogast, Raúl González-Domínguez, Mireia Urpi-Sarda, Pierre Micheau, Melanie Petera, Delphine Centeno, Stephanie Durand, Estelle Pujos-Guillot, Aniko Korosi, Paul Lucassen, Ludwig Aigner, Cécile Proust-Lima, Boris Hejblum, Catherine Helmer, Cristina Andres-Lacueva, Sandrine Thuret, Cécilia Samieri, Claudine Manach

**Abstract:**
With a global rise in the aging population and age-associated diseases, understanding how diet modifies cognitive aging represents key revenues for prevention. In this discovery (D-CogPlast#) study, we aimed to identify a combination of diet-derived metabolites associated with accelerated cognitive decline using untargeted metabolomics. We leveraged the French Three-City cohort of elderly people and, using an exploratory approach, designed a nested case-control study contrasting the metabolic profiles of 209 cases of cognitive decline over 13 years against 209 controls (matched for age, gender, and educational level) over 12 years following baseline blood draw.

Serum samples were profiled using high-resolution UHPLC-QToF. Validated PLS-DA of the baseline serum profiles clearly distinguished between case and control populations. A signature of 22 serum metabolites was associated with cognitive decline, using bootstrap-enhanced least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Seven metabolites derived from the food metabolome included coffee-derived metabolites (atractyligenin glucuronide, cyclo(leucyl-prolyl), and caffeine), a biomarker of citrus intake (proline betaine), 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-pentyl-2-furanpropionic acid (CMPFP), a cocoa-derived metabolite (cyclo(prolyl-valyl)), and an unknown compound putatively linked to wine intake. The other endogenous metabolites included three acylcarnitines, glycodeoxycholic acid, a glycerophospholipid, trimethyllysine, glucose, cortisol, creatinine, and arginine.

The 22-metabolite signature increased the predictive performance of cognitive decline from a cross-validated Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve of 62% (95% CI 56-67%) to 75% (95% CI 70-80%). Our untargeted metabolomics study supports a role for the food metabolome (e.g., metabolites from coffee, citrus fruits, cocoa, and wine) and various alterations in endogenous metabolism in cognitive aging.

#### 9D: Metabolic Profile and the Risk of Developing Prostate Cancer - A Nested-Case Control Study
- **Time:** 4:50 p.m. – 5:10 p.m.
- **Presenting Author:** Ali Moazzami, Department of Molecular Sciences, SLU, Sweden
- **Co-Authors:** Hanna E Röhnisch, Cecilie Kyrø, Anja Olsen, Elin Thysell, Göran Hallmans, Ali A. Moazzami

**Abstract:**
Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men. Identifying modifiable risk factors and markers for disease risk are therefore important. Our aim was to identify metabolites associated with the risk of prostate cancer using a nested case-control design.

We conducted a nested case-control study within the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study (NSHDS) cohort, comparing the metabolic profiles of 200 incident prostate cancer cases and 200 matched controls. Serum samples were analyzed using targeted and untargeted metabolomics. The results showed that several metabolites, including amino acids, lipids, and other small molecules, were significantly associated with the risk of developing prostate cancer. These findings provide new insights into the metabolic pathways involved in prostate cancer development and may lead to the identification of novel biomarkers for early detection and risk stratification.
