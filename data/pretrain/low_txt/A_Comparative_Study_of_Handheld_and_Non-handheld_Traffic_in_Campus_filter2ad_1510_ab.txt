### Exclusion of FIN and RESET
Connections that do not end with a FIN or RESET are excluded. In all cases, the distributions for both Net1 and Net2 are equivalent; we omit the Net2 distributions for brevity.

### Flow Properties Comparison (Net1)
#### CDFs of TCP Flow Properties
- **(a) Flow Size (KB)**
  - Handhelds tend to have smaller flow sizes compared to non-handhelds.
  - Median flow size for handhelds: 50 KB
  - Median flow size for non-handhelds: 100 KB
  - At the lower tail, there are fewer small flows for non-handhelds than for handhelds.
  - At the upper tail, the maximum flow size is larger for non-handhelds (2 GB) compared to handhelds (630 MB).
  - Smaller flow sizes for handhelds are expected due to content providers serving simpler or compressed content to mobile devices.

- **(b) Flow Duration (seconds)**
  - The median flow duration is approximately the same for both device types.
  - Handhelds have a narrower range of flow durations.
  - Middle 80% of handheld flows: 250 ms to 15 s
  - Middle 80% of non-handheld flows: 100 ms to 75 s
  - The lack of long flows in handhelds can be attributed to typically short usage sessions [5].
  - For specific applications:
    - Web flows: 5x shorter for handhelds, likely due to simplified versions of web pages.
    - Email traffic: Receiving protocols (IMAP, POP) have shorter average flows on non-handhelds, while sending protocol (SMTP) has shorter flows on handhelds. This discrepancy in SMTP may be due to a higher likelihood of non-handheld users including attachments.

- **(c) Flow Rate (Kbps)**
  - Both device types have the same median rate of 10 Kbps.
  - Only 10% of handheld flows are slower than 1 Kbps, compared to 30% of non-handheld flows.
  - Other factors consistent across both device types:
    - Average round trip time for 90% of TCP flows: < 100 ms
    - 4% of flows have one or more retransmissions due to retransmission timeout
    - 1% of flows have one or more retransmissions due to fast retransmit

### Web Traffic
Web traffic accounts for almost all handheld data (97%) and a large fraction of non-handheld data (82%). HTTP is widely used due to its interoperability and support for various content types. Web usage differs between device types due to differences in how individuals use these devices.

- **Hosts**
  - Table 4 lists the top HTTP hosts based on the size (content-length) of the data served to the devices.
  - Handhelds access more multimedia content by volume than non-handhelds.
  - Top 10 handheld hosts account for 74% of handheld data, while the top 10 non-handheld hosts account for 42% of non-handheld data.
  - Non-handheld devices have greater diversity in hosts and are more likely to receive content from hosts providing more than text or multimedia content.
  - Top 10 handheld hosts account for 30% of handheld HTTP requests, compared to 32% for non-handhelds.
  - Greater diversity of services in the top hosts by requests: social networking, streaming media, advertising, search, and news.

- **Content Type and Length**
  - Largest volume of handheld content: video (42%)
  - Top type for non-handhelds: images (29%)
  - Application content (e.g., documents, compressed files, streaming media):
    - Octet-stream is the most common subtype, accounting for 86% of handheld and 51% of non-handheld application type data.
    - Average octet-stream size: 713 KB for handhelds, 189 KB for non-handhelds.
    - Second most common application subtype: RSS feeds for handhelds, Shockwave Flash for non-handhelds.
    - No handhelds access Shockwave Flash content until recently [1].
    - Over 185 different application subtypes for non-handhelds, compared to 58 subtypes for handhelds.
  - Regular web browsing content: mostly image and text types.
  - Multimedia content: 46% of handheld content, 29% of non-handheld content.
  - Video accounts for 93% of multimedia traffic in handhelds and 80% in non-handhelds.

### Streaming Video
- **Streaming video** is a major source of traffic for handheld devices.
- Video content accounts for 40% of all handheld traffic, compared to 17% of all non-handheld traffic.
- Handheld video flows are large compared to overall handheld traffic:
  - 80% of video flows are > 50 KB in size.
  - Nearly 20% of handheld video flows are > 1 MB in size, with a 400 KB median.
  - Non-handheld video flows have a 3 MB median.

This structured and detailed presentation should make the information clearer and more accessible.
