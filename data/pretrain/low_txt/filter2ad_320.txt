## Abstract
Interest in the security of cyber-physical systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly growing across industry, government, and academia. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has established a Cyber-Physical Systems group, leading a public-private initiative to identify a general architecture, design principles, solutions, and future challenges. In Europe, the Horizon 2020 research program has targeted security issues related to cyber-physical infrastructures and the Internet of Things. Additionally, the CHIST-ERA fundamental science program launched calls for research projects on resilient, trustworthy cyber-physical systems (2015) and user-centered security and privacy in the Internet of Things (2016). In the United States, grant calls such as the 2019 CPS grant call by the National Science Foundation (NSF), with a total of $50M, highlight the significance of CPS and IoT security.

In 2019, the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) accepted two workshops: one on CPS security and privacy (held five times previously) and one on IoT security and privacy (held twice previously). Given the overlap in topics, the Steering Committees of these two workshops decided to merge, aiming to deliver a world-class event on CPS and IoT security and privacy.

## CCS Concepts
- Security and privacy

## Keywords

## 1. Review Process
CPSIOTSEC’20 received 25 submissions, which were assigned to 38 Technical Program Committee (TPC) members. Each paper received 4 or 5 reviews, resulting in a total of 112 reviews written by TPC members and 20 reviews from 18 external reviewers.

Following the online discussion, 5 regular papers (12 pages each) and 5 short papers were accepted, achieving an overall acceptance rate of 40%. Additionally, a keynote speech and two demonstrations will be presented.
