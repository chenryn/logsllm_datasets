### Introduction
PP-UTM is a compact protocol designed for privacy-preserving distance and proximity testing. Proximity testing, which involves determining whether two points are within a certain distance of each other, is significantly slower and requires more bandwidth than simple distance computation. We conducted tests using different discretization parameters, which influence the computational and communication costs for both homomorphic comparison protocols and garbled circuits.

### Performance Analysis
On a desktop, the comparison using garbled circuits takes 0.5 to 0.6 seconds, compared to 0.7 to 1.7 seconds with Erkin’s protocol. The time and bandwidth required for precomputation and protocol execution are detailed in Table 3. Garbled circuits require between 37.5 and 41.0 kB of bandwidth, which is more than twice the 7 to 14 kB required by Erkin’s protocol.

Unlike Erkin’s protocol, garbled circuits allow part of the computation to be performed without any user input. This precomputation can be done in advance (e.g., while charging the smartphone or during extended periods of inactivity), but still requires communication between protocol participants. Without precomputation, the comparison using garbled circuits takes 2.4 to 2.8 seconds, while Erkin’s protocol is faster, taking 1.2 to 2.8 seconds, depending on the discretization and distance function. With precomputation, however, the protocol execution time and bandwidth usage are reduced to 1.2 to 1.6 seconds.

### Cost Comparison
The following table summarizes the cost of our privacy-preserving distance measurement protocols:

| Device | Protocol | Time (ms) | Communication (B) |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Desktop | PP-HS    | 41.3      | 896               |
| Desktop | PP-ECEF  | 34.9      | 640               |
| Desktop | PP-UTM   | 26.5      | 512               |
| Smartphone | PP-HS | 78.0 | 896 |
| Smartphone | PP-ECEF | 66.7 | 640 |
| Smartphone | PP-UTM | 53.5 | 512 |

**Table 2: Cost of our privacy-preserving distance measurement protocols.**  
Discretization is performed with 1-meter accuracy for PP-UTM and PP-ECEF and roughly equivalent accuracy (9 digits) for PP-HS.

### Conclusion
In this paper, we introduced three privacy-preserving protocols: PP-UTM, PP-ECEF, and PP-HS, for secure distance computation and proximity testing. Unlike previous work, our PP-ECEF and PP-HS protocols compute distances over a spherical surface instead of a plane, providing significantly more accurate results over long distances with minimal overhead.

We used different techniques for distance computation—Euclidean distance on a plane (as a baseline) and distance on the surface of a sphere—to offer different trade-offs between accuracy and cost. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides a thorough characterization of the geometrical error and the approximation introduced by input discretization in privacy-preserving protocols.

We evaluated the cost of our protocols on a commodity Android device and a desktop computer via a prototype implementation. Our analysis shows that our protocols are practical and can be run efficiently on standard smartphones. Finally, we analyzed the security of our protocols under standard assumptions.
