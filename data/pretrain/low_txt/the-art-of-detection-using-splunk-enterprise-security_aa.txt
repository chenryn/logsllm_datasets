### Agenda
1. Operational Security at Red Hat
2. A New Triage Paradigm
3. Correlation Search Development Process
4. Extensions and Customizations
5. Case Study

### Operational Security
- **Leading Open Source Vendor:**
  - Global team of 14 people, dealing with various aspects of corporate security
  - Splunk customer since version 4.1
  - TB+ license
  - Needed a tool to support workflow and the entire incident management lifecycle
  - Cost and risk of developing/maintaining our own tool were considered greater than using Splunk Enterprise Security (ES)
  - Implemented ES at the end of last year

**Key Point:**
Enterprise Security is just a framework upon which to build a world-class security operation.

### A New Triage Paradigm
Our strategy to address alert fatigue and find what really matters.

**What Makes an Alert Actionable?**
- High Confidence?
- Realized Threat?
- Must Be Rectified by Human?
- Substantial Evidence?

**Intrinsically Actionable Alerts**

**Alert Fatigue Root Cause:**
- We falsely think we can detect "badness"
- Our detection mechanisms are biased towards early stages of the kill chain where there's greater entropy and lower fidelity
- Due to this assumption, we are not actually detecting genuinely bad things that present a real risk to the organization

**Solution:**
- Change-based correlation searches
- Risk-based incident detection
- Auto-close notables (no analyst triage required)
- Triage high-risk objects, prioritized by urgency (object priority x aggregated risk)

**Alert Fatigue Result:**
- Abstract rather than concrete approach to operational security allows unknown threats to be detected
- Analysts can concentrate on hunting and prioritize their triage time
- Analysts triage less than 6 objects in a shift (often none)
- Changes the notion of what constitutes a false-positive

**Requirements/Assumptions:**
- Bad actor changes something to achieve their objectives
- Sufficient data across the attack surface ingested and normalized
- Identity and asset prioritization
- Team of creative analysts
- Suite of correlation searches

**FAQ:**
- **Q: Why bother raising notables if they’re not triaged?**
  - **A:** To summarize and retain evidence
  - **A:** Provide the means for higher-order correlation searches that perform meta-analysis of trends and anomalies across notables
- **Q: If not triaging notables, which dashboards are used first for triage?**
  - **A:** “Security Posture” & “Risk Analysis”
- **Q: Why stop triaging notables raised by high-fidelity correlation searches?**
  - **A:** If they are intrinsically actionable, then they should be triaged by an analyst

**Security Event Tiering:**
- **Tier 1:** Raw information and events from security tools (low fidelity, not intrinsically actionable)
- **Tier 2:** Behavior-based correlation search notables (medium fidelity, generally not intrinsically actionable)
- **Tier 3:** Object risk/sequence-based correlation searches (high fidelity, requires attention)
- **Tier 4:** Abstract risk-based correlation searches (high fidelity, requires attention)

### Correlation Search Development Process

**1. The Idea:**
- What is the organization concerned about?
- What does it look like?

**2. The Source:**
- Scope and Abstraction
- Period and Acceleration
- Cleaning, Checking, and Filtering
- Enrichment and Modeling

**3. The Metric:**
- Signatures and Blacklists
- Statistics and Bounds
- Set Operations
- State Machines

**4. The Conditions:**
- Simple Threshold / Predicate
- Dynamic Threshold / Predicate
- Multi-Stage Conditionals
- Sequences

**5. The Triage:**
- Fields and Documentation
- Analysis and Enrichment
- Actions and Remediation
- Fidelity and Refinement

### Extensions and Customizations
Developing a SIEM to meet the needs of your team.

**Enrichment:**
- Internal Network Sessions (DHCP lease, VPN session)
- User Endpoints (learned devices)
- pDNS (derived from DNS logs / wire data)
- Notable Comment Key-Value Extraction
- Internal Subnets
- User Watchlist ([Link](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3591/))
- Notable Macro
