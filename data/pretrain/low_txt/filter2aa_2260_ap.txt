The Jersey City/Newark Urban Area (UA) regularly uses its shared ultra-high frequency (UHF) channels on a weekly basis to ensure communications interoperability. They also frequently deploy and use radio caches and gateways. During the TICP validation exercise, the UA demonstrated proficiency in using available communications interoperability equipment. However, minor training issues were observed, such as traffic units discussing road closures on the same shared channel that the Communications Unit Leader (COML) was using for a radio check, until a dispatcher intervened. Overall, evaluators noted that "users were proficient with the use of UTAC4, ITAC5, and OEM2 as shared channels" and "the gateway technician was proficient with the setup and use of the system."

**Recommendations:**
- Provide additional training on how to use radios and available channels.
- Include communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.

**Technology Overview:**
- The Jersey City Police Department operates a radio system with five UHF conventional channels.
- The Jersey City Fire Department uses two UHF conventional channels.
- The Newark Police Department uses a conventional UHF radio system.
- The Newark Fire Department uses a conventional very high frequency (VHF) radio system.
- Newark Emergency Medical Services (EMS) operates a VHF radio system.

During the TICP validation exercise, participating agencies demonstrated the ability to achieve communications interoperability, using all available means of communication, including radio caches, gateways, and shared channels. However, there was limited communication between fire and EMS during the exercise. The UA is encouraged to build on its local exercise success by further integrating state, federal, and support agencies in future events.

**Recommendations:**
- Continue to exercise interoperability solutions that allow for direct communication between fire and EMS.
- Include communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.

**Technology Overview:**
- The Buffalo UA has no shared radio systems and relies on a mix of VHF and UHF radio frequencies.
- The Buffalo Police and Fire Departments operate separate UHF radio systems.
- Erie County Fire Departments use VHF low band and UHF radio systems.
- The Erie County Sheriff operates a UHF radio system.
- In Niagara County, the Sheriff’s Office uses a VHF high band radio system, while other law enforcement agencies use a mix of UHF and VHF frequencies.
- Niagara County Fire operates on both VHF low band and UHF.
- Interoperability with state and other regional agencies is achieved through shared VHF and UHF channels, fixed and mobile gateways, and cached radios.
- The New York State Wireless Network is expected to be available in the UA by late 2008.

The New York City Urban Area (UA) includes the core city, surrounding counties of Nassau, Suffolk, and Westchester, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ), and the New York State Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). The New York City Interagency Communications Committee (NYCICC), established in 2002, meets regularly to evaluate and develop strategies for interoperable communications. The group has incorporated multiple local, regional, state, federal, and public support agencies into their decision-making process. Major organizations in the UA have existing agreements, but partnerships with smaller agencies are informal. A strategic plan incorporating counties from Connecticut and New Jersey is in development. Funding for interoperable capital improvements is provided through federal grants and local resources. While the NYCICC has coordinated regional communications efforts, additional participation and leadership from jurisdictions throughout the area are needed to achieve regionwide interoperability.

**Recommendations:**
- Document and reference all applicable local agencies in regional agreements.
- Reference all applicable agreements in the TICP and store them in an accessible format.
- Establish a regular review process to ensure agreements remain current and relevant.
- Develop, document, and implement a regionwide strategic plan with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance.
- Align local and state strategic planning efforts to ensure regional interoperability needs are met.
- Develop a funding strategy for identifying sustainable funding sources to cover lifecycle and recurring costs.
- Encourage broader involvement by senior government leadership in interoperability funding and procurement plans.

The New York TICP is based on existing policies and procedures, expanded to include new procedures and additional jurisdictions. These SOPs have been disseminated to necessary agencies and dispatch centers. New York City uses the Citywide Incident Management System (CIMS) for ICS implementation, while the rest of the UA uses NIMS. TICP peer reviewers noted the need for clear articulation of consistency in ICS to ensure smooth integration of first responders trained on NIMS. CIMS has been certified as compliant with NIMS, but agencies still refer to them separately, creating uncertainty about regionwide understanding of their seamless integration during a response.

**Recommendations:**
- Continue to distribute updated regional communications interoperability SOPs.
- Develop training policies and requirements for inclusion in the TICP.
- Ensure consistent application and practice of CIMS and NIMS across the area.
- Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs to ensure NIMS/ICS compliance.

New York City has developed multiple means of providing interoperable communications. FDNY and NYPD now use the same radios on the same frequency band, and Nassau and Suffolk Counties share channels with New York City. The city provides a common channel for coordination and interoperable communications among city and other agencies. The exercise evaluators noted a weekly roll call of federal agencies using the Federal Interoperability Gateway-based System. Due to the limited scope of the exercise, it was difficult to determine the level of local, regional, state, and federal participation in local response incidents. Officials in New York City indicate the need for more robust exercises with surrounding neighbors.

**Recommendations:**
- Conduct robust exercises to test interoperable communications capabilities.
- Consider adding interoperable communications as an evaluation component for all future exercises and day-to-day activities.

**Technology Overview:**
- The New York City UA has developed multiple means of providing interoperable communications.
- Command and control interoperability is provided by a Regional Wide-Area Interoperability system expanding into New Jersey and neighboring counties.
- An 800 MHz trunked system has dedicated command and control talk-groups, such as ALERT, for high-level, interoperable communications.
- Operational interoperability is provided by NYPD zone frequencies, and tactical interoperability uses a common UHF point-to-point channel.
- The counties operate 800 MHz, UHF, and VHF systems providing interoperability to public safety agencies.
- The UA employs various national law enforcement, New York State Police Mutual Rapid Deployment, and National Public Safety Planning Advisory Committee mutual aid channels.
- The Federal Interoperability Channel provides interoperability to local, regional, and state agencies throughout the UA and northeastern New Jersey.
