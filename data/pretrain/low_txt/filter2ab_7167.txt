**ATT&CK ID:** G0034  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Sandworm Team

In the 2015 attack on the Ukrainian power grid, the Sandworm Team employed a tactic that involved scheduling the disconnection of uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems. This was done in such a way that when the main power was cut from the substations, the UPS devices would also shut down, thereby preventing the recovery of power and service.
