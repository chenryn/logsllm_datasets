### 0.015 for Signal of Type 3
There are no distinct peaks in the signals of Type 4. We compare peak detection approaches with the classic Secretary Problem (SP) solution, which is known to deliver the most optimal results in selecting the maximum value without peak detection. The comparison of the results is illustrated in the form of a histogram, representing the distribution of the error in selecting an optimal sample (Fig. 5).

As can be seen, peak detection approaches yield superior results compared to the SP algorithm for the sensor signal of Type 1 (first row in the figure). This is because the SP search often terminates prematurely by ignoring the correlations in the signal, leading to high error in selecting the maximum value. In contrast, the low noise level in these signals allows for accurate detection of the signal peak. However, the proposed approaches do not perform well with noisy signals. Noise corrupts the CUSUM statistics, resulting in a high false alarm rate. Although smoothing reduces noise, it introduces a delay in the smoothed signal by \((m-1)/2\) samples, causing peak detection when the actual signal is already decaying. Conversely, the SP delivers lower error with noisy signals as it sets the aspiration value based on the highest outlier in the observation window.

Enhancing the SP solution with peak detection may, in certain cases, substantially increase the attacker’s chances of selecting the maximum value. However, any peak detection algorithm must first be tuned to match the properties of the sensor signal.

### 5.1.3 Attacks in a Steady State
So far, we have reported results with disturbance IDV (8) active. However, one of the primary goals of process control is to maintain the process as close as possible to its optimal steady state (without disturbances). In the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process, variables in a steady state do not deviate much from the set points and follow a Gaussian distribution accurately. Most of the sensor signals are of Type 4, with a few of Type 3. Results from Table 3 show that, relative to each other, all approaches demonstrate performance similar to the use case from 5.1.1, with the exception of the NS statistics for OT. Even with a higher threshold of \(\alpha = 3.5\), the Outlier Test (OT) delivers a diminishingly small number of non-selections. In a steady state, the observation window for OT can be substantially reduced. For most sensor signals, it is sufficient to observe only 5 hours of samples to accurately identify \(\mu\) and \(\sigma\). With this, the Time to Attack (TTA) in the Outlier Test becomes comparable to the TTA of the secretary approach with a reduced learning window \(n/\log(n)\).

Due to minimal variations in the process measurements, all approaches demonstrate a lower error in selecting the best possible value. However, for the same reason, the selected attack values are also lower. Moreover, in a steady state, the process is more resilient to attacks on certain individual control loops. For instance, it becomes impossible to bring the process into an unsafe state with any attack on XMEAS(1), and the Shutdown Time (SDT) for attacks on XMEAS{5;12;17} increases more than twice. Therefore, it might not be rewarding for the attacker to strike during a steady state.

### 5.2 Discussion and Future Areas of Research
After gaining access to the process measurements, the attacker faces several uncertainties. She neither knows the process variable range nor the sensitivity of the process to the magnitude of the manipulations. More importantly, the adversary has no knowledge about the time constants of individual control loops and the specifics of disturbance propagation. This means the attacker is uncertain about which attack value to choose and for how long to carry out the assault. The latter is crucial for planning concealing activities. To maximize impact and minimize attack duration, the attacker should try to select the highest or lowest process value possible.

Our study shows that the characteristics of the sensor signals, even within the same facility, are very dissimilar, and attack strategies deliver radically different results when applied to different types of process measurements at different plant states and operating modes. Attacking without knowledge of the current state of the plant is highly likely to result in nuisance rather than actual disruption. In contrast, a knowledgeable attacker can bring the system down in a matter of minutes, leaving operators no chance to respond with countermeasures (e.g., [31]).

Therefore, destructive capabilities in the cyber-physical domain predominantly exist in relation to a specific target, and knowledge of process dynamics (such as results from Table 1) is valid only for a specific process control scheme. A separate analysis would be required for other control schemes of the TE process, such as [22, 28, 19]. The attacker can do her homework well and design part of the attack in advance but will need to tune the attack locally through reconnaissance activities, such as changing configuration parameters, manipulating process variables, or turning components on and off while observing the system's reaction. From a defense perspective, such short-term "testing" process deviations can be detected by process-aware anomaly detection solutions [23, 4]. Below, we describe further considerations and areas of future research.

#### 5.2.1 Impact of the Sampling Frequency
The sampling rate of the sensor signals changes its noise profile. Therefore, we investigated the impact of the sampling frequency (\(f_s\)). As anticipated, a lower signal sampling rate results in lower error in selecting the best sample due to reduced noise levels. However, the selected attack value is also lower if compared to the attack on the signal sampled at a higher rate due to the reduced number of high-amplitude outlier samples (Fig. 6). Depending on the control loop sensitivity, we observed an increase in shutdown time up to 3 hours.

#### 5.2.2 Detection of Plant State Change
The reference value learned in the observation window is only valid for a particular plant state. In practice, the process periodically undergoes changes in its operating conditions, such as updates of set points, operating modes, production loads, and disturbances. The attacker needs to quickly detect such changes to adapt her attack strategy to new circumstances. Figure 7 demonstrates the detection of the A/C feed ratio change using the CUSUM algorithm. With a threshold \(h = 0.001\), such a change can be detected in 8.5 minutes, and with \(h = 0.005\) in 12.5 minutes. Once the change is detected, the attacker can either reset her learning phase immediately or wait to see if the process state continues to change.

#### 5.2.3 Chaining Attacks
As mentioned in 5.1.3, even after executing a successful Denial of Service (DoS) attack in a steady state, it would take a long time to bring the process into an unsafe state. To achieve a shorter SDT, the attacker would need to disturb the process first to cause greater deviation in the process measurements, allowing her to select a higher or lower attack value. Causing a plant-wide disturbance might be difficult, but the attacker can "chain" two DoS attacks to accomplish her goal. For example, a minimum flow attack on a separator underflow causes an oscillation effect on the separator level (Fig. 8a). After 30 minutes, the separator level \(L_{sep}\) reaches 30%. The attacker can use the CUSUM algorithm to detect the change and launch a DoS attack on \(L_{sep}\) when its value reaches its lowest point. In this way, the shutdown can be reached in 3.43 hours compared to 12.03 hours if the attacker were to execute a direct attack on the separator level sensor in a steady state. Similarly, a minimum level attack on the separator underflow causes an immediate step change, which can be quickly and accurately detected and used for a successive DoS attack (Fig. 8b).

### 6. Related Work
Securing process control infrastructure and control communication is the first step towards safe and secure operations. A large body of literature on Industrial Control Systems (ICS) security focuses on intercepting and manipulating traffic [29], infection by malware [3], and unauthorized access [18]. These threats are addressed by designing ICS-specific defenses such as intrusion detection systems [32, 13], authentication and encryption schemes [8], access control [26], code verification [25], and others.

Physical processes and their particular states are inherently time-dependent. The importance of timing parameters in cyber-physical security has been demonstrated in several academic works. For example, it was shown that process-aware segmentation of the control network increases the survivability of the process and extends its time to shutdown [10]. Another study examined the effectiveness of remotely executed cyber-attacks on a valve in a Boiling Water Power Plant, where PLC task scheduling had a major impact on the attack outcome [11]. Synchronization, a critical timing parameter for the stability of the power grid, was discussed in [1], providing an understanding of the impact of timing uncertainty on system model accuracy. A heuristic triangle approximation algorithm from [16] can be used for peak detection in sensor signals.

### 7. Conclusion
In this paper, we introduced the problem of timing-based DoS attacks based on real-time measurement of process values. We used the TE process to illustrate our approach, but our basic methodology is applicable to any cyber-physical system. Our study shows that the characteristics of the sensor signals, even within the same facility, are very dissimilar, and attack strategies deliver radically different results when applied to different types of process measurements. We also showed that applying peak detection algorithms for dealing with correlated time series can potentially improve the performance of the attacker. However, noisy signals can render peak detection ineffective.

In general, it is not possible to give definitive conclusions regarding which of the proposed approaches is more effective. All approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages, and their performance largely depends on the type of the signal under analysis and the state of the plant. For instance, NCUSUM can detect changes to the plant state (e.g., in the case of a reference variable change) as it is quick and can be easily tuned, but it was not a significant addition to the problem of detecting peaks in noisy signals.

Overall, the classic secretary approach delivers the best results at the cost of having a long learning phase and a relatively high number of non-selections. However, it consistently delivers good results regardless of the plant state and signal shape, making it particularly useful in the context of black-box exploitation, where the attacker has no prior knowledge about sensor signal properties. Adversaries who do not want to risk ending the observation period without making a decision may select the SP solution with a reduced learning window \(n/\log(n)\) or the Outlier Test to shorten the time to attack.

In future work, we plan to study how attacking multiple sensor signals can affect the system and include DoS attacks on control signals.
