#### Abstract

Business-to-Business (B2B) integration, also known as external Information Systems (IS) integration and e-business integration, has revolutionized the way businesses interact with partners, suppliers, and customers. It aims to automate and integrate business processes and interactions by significantly transforming traditional methods. At its core, B2B integration is about the exchange of data and information between businesses and their information systems.

One common approach organizations have adopted to achieve higher levels of integration is the use of XML as the standard language for data representation. Today, it is estimated that most organizations use XML for storing and transferring data. However, XML only provides a syntactic structure for the data exchanged in a B2B context, as tags do not have predefined meanings. This addresses only one level of interoperability required in B2B transactions. Developers still face the challenge of semantic interoperability, which involves integrating resources developed using different vocabularies and perspectives on the data.

To overcome the limitations of purely syntactic B2B integration, the Semantic Web and its associated technologies offer a promising solution for semantic B2B integration. This keynote will discuss architectural solutions that enable organizations to participate in B2B transactions using syntactic protocols (such as XML) while representing their internal vocabularies and documents semantically (using OWL). Partners and suppliers can freely exchange syntactic documents. Upon receiving a syntactic document, an organization can create a mapping between the document's elements and the concepts in an ontology that describes the organization's domain of discourse (i.e., internal vocabulary). The organization can create multiple mappings, which are stored in a local repository and can be reused when new, unseen, syntactic documents arrive. When a new syntactic document is received, the repository is queried to determine if any of the syntactic elements have been mapped to ontological concepts in the past.

#### Short Biography

**Jorge Cardoso** (http://www.dme.uma.pt/jcardoso) joined the University of Madeira (Portugal) in March 2003. Prior to this, he lectured at the University of Georgia (USA) and the Instituto Politécnico de Leiria (Portugal). Dr. Cardoso earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Georgia in 2002, under the supervision of Amit Sheth. During his time at the University of Georgia, he was part of the LSDIS Lab, where he conducted extensive research on workflow management systems. In 1999, he worked at the Boeing Company on enterprise application integration with Christoph Bussler.

Dr. Cardoso co-organized and co-chaired the First, Second, and Third International Workshops on Semantic and Dynamic Web Processes. He has published over 60 refereed papers in the areas of workflow management systems, the Semantic Web, and related fields. He has also edited three books on the Semantic Web and Web services. Dr. Cardoso serves on the Editorial Board of the *Enterprise Information Systems Journal*, the *International Journal on Semantic Web and Information Systems*, and the *International Journal of Information Technology*. He is also a member of the Editorial Advisory Review Board of Idea Group Inc.

Before joining the University of Georgia, Dr. Cardoso worked for two years at CCG, Zentrum für Graphische Datenverarbeitung, where he conducted research on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work.
