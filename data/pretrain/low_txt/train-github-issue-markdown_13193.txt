## Description

I propose the addition of a feature that allows users to set up **application groups** with customizable window positions, similar to the functionality available on the _Surface Duo_. This would enhance user experience by enabling more efficient and organized multitasking.

### Proposed Feature
- **Application Group Configuration**: Users should be able to configure application groups with specific window positions, similar to the setup on the Surface Duo.
  - **Example**: 
    ![App Group](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/29bb4816ae8761f93789c032e18f2f1c3e10181ad70a0fc8e07121e3d53fe819/68747470733a2f2f6d73706f776572757365722e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30382f656467652d616e642d6f6e656e6e6f74652d6170702d67726f75702e6a7067)

- **Integration with FancyZones**: The application group positions can be configured using **FancyZones**, providing flexibility and precision in window placement.
- **Taskbar Icon**: An **application group** icon should be added to the taskbar for easy access.
  - **Example**:
    ![Taskbar App Group](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40165444/94113682-8d00e280-fe47-11ea-8257-a7fe65aa7079.png)

### Benefits
- **Enhanced Productivity**: Users can quickly switch between pre-configured application groups, improving workflow efficiency.
- **Customization**: The ability to use FancyZones for precise window placement adds a layer of customization, allowing users to tailor their workspace to their needs.

### Related Enhancement
- This feature builds upon and enhances the existing functionality described in #5901.
