## Abstract
Attackers frequently use URLs to propagate scams and malware. Since domain reputation can be used to identify malicious activity, attackers often register these domains just before an attack. This paper examines the DNS behavior of malicious domains shortly after registration, as identified by their appearance in a spam trap. We analyze the behavioral properties of these domains from two perspectives: (1) the DNS infrastructure associated with the domain, as observable from resource records; and (2) the DNS lookup patterns from networks performing initial lookups. Our findings suggest that monitoring this early DNS behavior could be useful for early detection of malicious domains. We find that about 55% of scam domains are used in attacks at least one day after registration, indicating potential for early discovery based on DNS infrastructure. Additionally, we identify specific IP address regions and autonomous systems (ASes) that host only malicious domains, and observe that malicious domains are quickly queried by a diverse set of networks. These features may serve as the basis for a DNS-based early warning system for attacks.

## 1. Introduction
Attackers often use URLs to advertise scams or propagate malware. The reputation of a domain can be used to identify malicious behavior, but miscreants often register these domains "just in time" before an attack. This paper explores the DNS behavior of attack domains, as identified by their appearance in a spam trap, shortly after registration. We examine the behavioral properties of these domains from two perspectives: (1) the DNS infrastructure associated with the domain, as observable from the resource records; and (2) the DNS lookup patterns from networks performing initial lookups. Our analysis yields several findings that may be useful for early detection of malicious domains.

By monitoring the DNS infrastructure for these malicious domains, we find that about 55% of scam domains are used in attacks at least one day after registration, suggesting the potential for early discovery based on DNS infrastructure. We also find that certain regions of IP address space and ASes are used exclusively for malicious domains. Malicious domains have resource records distributed more widely across IP address space and are quickly queried by a variety of different networks. These features are often evident before any attack takes place and could serve as the basis for a DNS-based early warning system for attacks.

## 2. Context and Related Work
### 2.1 DNS Resource Records and Lookups
When a domain is registered, several basic entries are inserted into the zone files, including NS, MX, and A records. Recursive DNS servers relay user queries to authoritative servers, reducing wide-area DNS traffic. The top-level domain (TLD) name servers provide a natural vantage point for monitoring lookups directed to second-level domains.

### 2.2 Related Work
Previous studies have analyzed DNS resource records and lookup patterns. Holz et al. [10] investigated A record diversity to identify fast-flux service networks. Konte et al. [12] studied changing rates of IP addresses in DNS records of scam domains. Our work tracks DNS records of newly registered domains to infer spatial and temporal characteristics. Anax [1] scanned recursive servers to detect poisoning attacks, while we monitor records in authoritative servers to discover characteristics of malicious domain registration.

## 3. Data Collection
We describe our data collection process, which includes DNS data from Verisign's TLD servers and resource records from newly registered domains. We use PlanetLab to query a large set of domains and collect DNS lookup patterns. We also use spam traps to capture emails from spammers and extract second-level domains involved in spamming activities.

## 4. Registration and Resource Records
### 4.1 Time Between Registration and Attack
We first check the time between domain registration and subsequent attack to investigate the potential for early detection. We then explore how DNS behavior associated with the domain's resolvers can be an early signal for malicious domains.

## 5. Lookup Characteristics
We study the DNS lookup patterns for different types of domains, focusing on the early lookup patterns of newly registered malicious domains. We find that these domains are initially queried by a more diverse set of network address regions than legitimate domains, and they become "popular" more quickly.

## 6. Conclusion
Our study reveals that monitoring the initial DNS behavior of domains can be a powerful tool for early detection of malicious domains. By analyzing DNS infrastructure and lookup patterns, we can identify unique fingerprints that distinguish legitimate domains from those associated with Internet attacks. Future work will focus on developing a DNS-based early warning system for attacks.
