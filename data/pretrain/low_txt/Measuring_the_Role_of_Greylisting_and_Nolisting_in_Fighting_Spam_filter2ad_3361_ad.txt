## Related Work
Spam detection has been an active research area for decades. Various approaches have been proposed to mitigate the impact of unsolicited messages. These methods can be categorized into sender-based and content-based filtering.

### Sender-Based Filtering
- **Blacklists** [11], [23], [28]
- **Graylists** [17], [19]
- **Server Authentication** [3]
- **IP Reputation** [4], [5], [14]

### Content-Based Filtering
- **Bayesian Filters** [29], [36]
- **Collaborative Filtering** [18], [22]
- **Email Prioritization** [35], [38]

### Greylisting
Greylisting was introduced by Harris [17] in 2003 as an effective method to filter out spam emails. Levine [24] conducted one of the first experiments demonstrating its efficacy, noting that non-RFC-compliant clients (i.e., those that do not retry after the first failed attempt) are rare enough to be handled manually with a whitelist. Sochor [31] evaluated the performance of greylisting combined with some Postfix restrictions over a two-year period (2007-2008), finding that its effectiveness remained constant. However, he suggested that greylisting alone is insufficient as a standalone spam defense mechanism due to the need for automated whitelisting. In [32], Sochor discusses different greylisting variants and provides empirical suggestions for efficient greylisting parameters, recommending additional tests in a controlled environment.

### Botnets and Spam
Botnets have become a major tool for sending spam from end-hosts. Several studies [10], [15], [20], [25], [27], [37] have explored methods to identify spamming bots. Our analysis uses these results to select samples and test the efficacy of greylisting and nolisting techniques.

## Conclusions
This paper presents a comprehensive study of the advantages and disadvantages of using nolisting and greylisting as spam filtering techniques. To our knowledge, we are the first to measure the effectiveness of nolisting and to test how real malware behaves in the presence of these defenses. We hope this paper will help system administrators decide whether to implement nolisting or greylisting and how to configure these solutions in their networks.
