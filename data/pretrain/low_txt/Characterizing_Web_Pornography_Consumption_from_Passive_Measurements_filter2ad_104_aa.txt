### Abstract

Web pornography represents a large fraction of Internet traffic, with thousands of websites and millions of users. Studying web pornography consumption allows understanding human behaviors and is crucial for medical and psychological research. However, given the lack of public data, these works typically build on surveys, limited by different factors, e.g., unreliable answers that volunteers may (involuntarily) provide.

In this work, we collect anonymized accesses to pornography websites using HTTP-level passive traces. Our dataset includes about 15,000 broadband subscribers over a period of 3 years. We use it to provide quantitative information about the interactions of users with pornographic websites, focusing on time and frequency of use, habits, and trends. We distribute our anonymized dataset to the community to ease reproducibility and allow further studies.

### 1. Introduction

Pornography and technology have enjoyed a close relationship in the last decades, with technology hugely increasing the capabilities of the porn industry. From the limited market reachable through public theatres, the introduction of the videocassette recorder in the 1970s abruptly changed the way of accessing pornography, allowing access in the privacy and comfort of individual homes. Then, the birth of cable networks and specialty channels in the 1990s allowed a further step toward accessibility and privacy, giving the possibility to retrieve content directly from home. Finally, the Internet revolutionized the market again, guaranteeing direct desktop delivery to every individual with a connection, interactivity through forums and webcams, free content and, at the same time, anonymity.

In 2017, the most used pornographic platform in the world (Pornhub, according to Alexa ranking \[1]), claimed 80 million daily accesses to its website \[2]. The importance of Internet pornography as a prevalent component of popular culture and the need for its study has been recognized for a long time \[6].

In this work we do not attempt to classify Internet pornography. Rather, we refer to the term web pornography (WP) as any online material that, directly or indirectly, seeks to bring about sexual stimulation \[4]. Therefore, the term "pornographic website" is used here to describe services that provide actual pornographic videos, sell sex-related merchandise, help in arranging sexual encounters, etc. We refer only to adult pornography websites and do not advocate the inclusion of child pornography websites in our research—this paper has no application whatsoever to child pornography. The word "pornography," in the context of this article, refers exclusively to legal content in the territories of the EU and USA.

Through the years, WP has been the subject of many studies aiming at describing how people make use of it or pinpointing pathological situations correlated to excessive use. However, such works typically come from the medical and psychology communities and are based on surveys that cover a small number of volunteers. Moreover, previous studies \[10,12] report that people tend to lie, either consciously or unconsciously, when answering surveys about private life, especially about sexuality. Some people declare more accesses than real (e.g., to appear uninhibited), while others understate actual consumption, fearing social blame. Both these behaviours—called social desirability biases—and egosyntonic/egodystonic feelings (i.e., being or not in accordance with their self-image) make surveys less reliable than other sources of information.

In contrast, this study investigates WP by means of passive network measurements, collected from about 15,000 broadband subscribers over a period of 3 years. MindGeek, a company operating many popular pornographic websites, switched to encryption only in April 2017, being the first major player in the WP industry to adopt HTTPS \[3]. Thus, the vast majority of WP portals used plain-text HTTP up to March 2017, allowing us to leverage HTTP-level measurements and obtain detailed results of WP consumption. Using recent advances in data science, we extract only user actions toward WP portals from a deluge of HTTP data.

**Main contributions:**

* We provide a thorough characterization of WP consumption leveraging measurements from 15,000 broadband subscribers over 3 years.
* We show how users moved to mobile devices through the years, even if the time spent on WP remained constant.
* We show that typical WP sessions last less than 15 minutes, with users rarely accessing more than one website. Less than 10% of users consume WP more than 15 days in a month, and repeated use within a single day is very sporadic.
* We release our dataset to the community in anonymized form for further investigation \[1]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only public dataset that includes WP accesses from regular Internet users.

The employed metrics are taken from medical literature surveys and WP portal reports. We restrict our analysis only to those metrics that we were able to verify given our data. Our results enhance the visibility and understanding of these topics and provide a less mediated overview of user behaviors, mostly confirming what emerges from medical surveys.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 summarizes related
work. Section 3 describes data collection, processing and privacy issues, while
Sect. 4 presents the results. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes the paper.

2 Related Work

Most previous works that investigate the interaction between users and WP
leverage the information contained in surveys proposed to groups of volunteers.
Vaillancourt-Morel et al. [18] examine the potential presence of different profiles
of pornography users and their relation with sexual satisfaction and sexual dysfunction.
The investigation is conducted over a poll that involved 830 adults,
and they group users' behavior in three clusters. Daspe et al. [5] investigate the
relationship between frequency of WP consumption and the personal perception
of this behavior, pointing out that often there are strong discrepancies. Another
analysis of the phenomenon is provided by Grubbs et al. [9], where the analysis
is conducted over two participants sets, divided in students and adults, showing
that moral scruples can infect the self-impression over their consumption.
Wetterneck et al. [14] propose a critical analysis of WP, showing the various
limitations of the state of the art of studies that assessed online pornography
usage, concerning its definition, consumption, and the variability of its measurements.

Fewer works used network measurements to study WP. Tyson et al. [17]
extract trends and characteristics in a major adult video portal (YouPorn) by analyzing
almost 200k videos, together with meta-data such as page content, ratings
and tags. In a similar direction, Mazières et al. [11] produce and analyze a semantic
network of WP categories, extracted from the portal xHamster, in order to find
which are the most dominants and if they are actually meaningful. Ortiz et al. [13]
study a Chilean websites containing human images and classify them in normal,
porno and nude, with the objective of automatically discovering WP websites.
Finally, Coletto et al. [3] study users' activity in social networks related to WP, in
order to extract information about the seclusion of those communities with respect
to the rest of the population and their characteristics in terms of age and habits
and gender. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use passive measurements
to study the behavior of users accessing web pornography.

3 Measurements

3.1 Data Collection

In this work, we rely on network measurements coming from passive monitoring
of a population of broadband subscribers over a period of 3 years (from March
2014 to March 2017). We have instrumented a Point-of-Presence (PoP) of a
European ISP, where ≈ 10 000 ADSL and ≈ 5 000 FTTH customers are aggregated.
ADSL downlink capacity is 4–20 Mbit/s, with uplink limited to 1 Mb/s.
FTTH users enjoy 100 Mb/s downlink, and 10 Mbit/s uplink. Each subscription
refers to an installation, where users' devices (PCs, smartphones, etc.) connect
via WiFi or Ethernet through a home gateway. Important to our analysis, the
ISP provides each customer a fixed IP address, allowing us to track her over
time. Nevertheless, a small fraction of customers abandoned the ISP during the
observation period, and few new ones joined. All ADSL customers are residential
customers (i.e., households), while a small number of business customers exist
among the FTTH customers.

To gather measurements we use Tstat [15], a passive meter that collects
rich per-flow summaries, with hundreds of statistics regarding TCP/UDP connections
issued by clients. Beside, Tstat includes a DPI module that creates log
files containing details about observed HTTP transactions. For each transaction,
it records the URL, a client identifier as well as other HTTP headers of requests
and responses. Our measurements are based on the inspection of HTTP headers,
and, as such, neglect all encrypted traffic. However, no big WP portal used
encryption at the time our dataset was collected. Generated log files are copied
to our back-end servers with a daily frequency. Data is stored on a medium-sized
Hadoop cluster to allow scalable processing. All processing is done using Apache
Spark and Python. The stored data covers 3 years of measurements, totaling
20.5 TB of compressed and anonymized flow logs (around 138 billion records).

3.2 Definition of User and Its Limitations

Our PoP is located at the Broadband Remote Access Server (BRAS) level. Each
subscription is identified by a unique and fixed IP address. However, subscriptions
typically refer to households where potentially more than one person surf
the Internet sharing the same public IP address. As such, relying on the client
IP to identify a user would not be precise enough to study habits and behavior.
Thus, in our work we define a user as the concatenation of the client IP address
and the user-agent as extracted from the corresponding HTTP header. Note
that with this definition a single person may appear multiple times with different
identifiers if she uses multiple devices or her device incurs software updates
that modify the user agent string. Analyses are thus performed on a per-browser
fashion – i.e., each user-agent string observed in a household. Privacy requirements
limit any finer granularity.

The evaluated dataset includes only a regional sample of households in a single
country. Users in other regions may have diverse browsing habits. Equally,
mobile devices have been monitored only while connected to home WiFi networks.
As such, our quantification of browsing on mobile terminals is actually a
lower-bound, since visits while connected on mobile networks are not captured.

3.3 Data Filtering and Session Definition

Starting from a HTTP-level dataset, we need to filter only entries referring to
WP websites. Studying innovative methodologies to automatically isolate traffic
towards particular services is out of the scope of this work. We employ a
blacklist based approach to perform classification. We build on public available
lists, achieving robustness by combining three different sources.4 These three
lists provide a set of domain names that offer different WP content (ranging
from video streaming to thematic forums). To avoid false positives, we consider
only those domain names contained in at least two over three lists. We come up
with 310 252 unique entries, arranged over 460 top-level domains.

After filtering entries referring to WP websites, we perform a further step to
identify sessions of continuous activity. To this end, we group data by user, and
process HTTP transactions by start time. We then identify session as follows:
when a user accesses a pornographic website we open a new session and account
to this all subsequent entries to WP websites. We terminate a session if we do
not observe any entry to WP for a period of 30 min. While defining a browsing
session is complicated [8], we simply consider a time larger than 30 min as an
indication of the session end as it is often seen in previous works (e.g., [2]), and
in applications like Google Analytics.5

3.4 User Actions Extraction

Subsequently, we further filter the dataset to isolate only those HTTP requests
containing an explicit user action by the user. This step aims at isolating users'
behavior discarding all HTTP traffic related to inner objects of webpages such
as images, style-sheets, and scripts. To this end, we implement the methodology
described in our previous work [19] that builds a machine-learning model to
pinpoint intentionally visited URLs (i.e., webpages) from raw HTTP traces.
The followed strategy has as core module a supervised classifier, which is able to
correctly recognize user actions in HTTP traces. It results to reach an accuracy
of over 98%, and it can be successfully applied to different scenarios, including
smartphone apps [20].

In total, after the extraction, we have 58 million user actions/visited webpages
towards 59 989 different adult domains. We observe an average of 13 261
different WP users per month. For each user, we determine information about
used OS, browser, and if the device was a PC, a smartphone, or a tablet. These
information are extracted from the user-agent of the original HTTP request at
the time of the capture, using the Universal Device Detection library.6 We made
these data available to the community in anonymized form to guarantee reproducibility
of our results and further investigations [1]. In the remainder of the
paper, we only take into account user actions, to which we simply refer with the
term visited webpages.

3.5 Privacy and Ethical Concerns

Passive measurements potentially expose information which may threaten users'
privacy. As such, our data collection program has been approved by the partner
ISP and by the ethical board of our University. Moreover, this specific data
analysis project was also subject to a privacy impact assessment that was done
with the data protection officer of our institution.

We undertake several countermeasures to avoid recording any personally
identifiable information. Before any storage, all client identifiers are anonymized
using Crypto-PAn algorithm [7], and URLs are truncated to avoid recording
URL-encoded parameters. Encryption keys are varied on a monthly basis, to
avoid persistent users tracking. Sensitive information such as cookies and Post
data are not monitored at all. Logs are stored in a secured data center in an
encrypted format. We emphasize again that in our research we only refer to adult
pornography websites, obtained through open datasets, referring exclusively to
legal content in the territories of EU and USA.

4 Results

In this section, we report the most significant results emerging from our dataset.
We first focus on the time dimension, showing the evolution of WP consumption
from 2014 to 2017 in terms of quantity and device type. We then focus on users,
characterizing duration and frequency of their WP use. Finally, we provide some
figures about the popularity of services.

4.1 Usage Trends

Our first analysis aims at describing WP consumption trends from 2014 to 2017.
In Fig. 1a, we focus on the time spent on WP by monitored users. The blue
(solid), red (dash-dot) and green (dashed) curves report, respectively, the 25th,
50th and 75th percentiles of the total per-user daily time spent on WP, i.e., the
sum of the duration of all the WP sessions. Curves are calculated only for active
users, i.e., users visiting at least one WP website during one day. Curves are
not continuous, for the lack of data due to outages in out PoP. The outcome
shows a rather stable trend over the observation period, with half of the users
spending less than 18 min per day on WP; however almost 25% of users reaches
40 min of daily activity. These are day-wise statistics, and do not provide figures
about the repeated use of WP across multiple days by the same user, as we
will see later. Measuring the overall share of users accessing WP portals is not
easy using our data, as a single identifier – the client IP address – identifies a
broadband subscription, potentially shared by multiple users. However, we notice
that every day 12% of subscribers access WP websites, and this value is constant
across years. A further analysis on WP pervasiveness is given in Sect. 4.2.

Those results can be used as a comparison with surveys statistics, fortifying
or confuting what the participants declare. Vaillancourt-Morel et al. [18] study
the characteristics of WP consumers. The majority of the chosen sample uses WP
for recreation only, on average 24 min per week, a value consistent but slightly
higher compared to our data.

Then, we investigate the evolution in device categories use (PCs, tablets
