**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Privileged Account Management

Regularly audit the permission levels of local accounts to identify any situations that could allow an adversary to gain broad access by obtaining credentials of a privileged account. [16] [17] These audits should also check for the creation of new, unauthorized local accounts. Implementing Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) can help prevent the reuse of local administrator credentials across a domain. [18]
