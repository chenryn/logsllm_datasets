### Snapshot Fingerprinting

To properly analyze the data collected from participating devices, we needed to map each collected device snapshot to a single device. As mentioned in § 3, the first snapshot from a device includes:
1. The 10-digit install ID computed by RacketStore upon installation.
2. The 6-digit participant ID, uniquely generated by us and assigned to each participant.
3. The Android ID.

We expected that the combination of the participant ID, install ID, and Android ID would be sufficient to provide this mapping. However, we found that the same device can be responsible for multiple install events of RacketStore, where a different combination of install ID, participant ID, and Android ID is reported in different snapshots from the same device. For instance, we encountered cases where different ASO workers, with different assigned participant IDs, shared some devices. This can occur if the workers are employed by the same organization, thus having access to a common set of devices, or if the same workers pretend to be different workers. Such workers can install RacketStore at different times, believing it to be a repeat campaign. We also observed workers who repeatedly install and uninstall RacketStore to get paid multiple times for the installation.

Furthermore, for some installs, due to suspected incompatibilities (there are over 24,000 types of device models), the collected snapshots did not include the Android ID and device information. We note that we did not collect device IMEI since it requires an additional dangerous permission, which we wanted to avoid.
