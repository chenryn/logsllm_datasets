**Title: Black Hat US 2022: DirectX - The New Hyper-V Attack Surface**

In 2020, Microsoft introduced a new feature in Hyper-V: GPU-Paravirtualization, which is based on GPU virtualization technology. This technology is integrated into the Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM), and all WDDMv2.5 or later drivers natively support GPU virtualization. However, with new features come new attack surfaces.

In this presentation, I will disclose four vulnerabilities in the Hyper-V DirectX component that I have discovered and which have since been fixed. Two of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to run a specially crafted application on a guest operating system, potentially enabling the execution of arbitrary code on the Hyper-V host operating system.

To understand these vulnerabilities, I will first introduce the basic architecture of the Hyper-V DirectX component and explain how to configure virtual machine parameters to use this virtual device. By referring to the WSL Linux kernel source code and through reverse engineering, I will highlight the attack surface of the Hyper-V DirectX component. The disclosure of these four vulnerabilities will provide a deeper understanding of this attack surface.

I will then describe how to use fuzzing to identify vulnerabilities in this attack surface. As a practical example, I will present a simple fuzzing framework that I developed. Finally, I will share my key takeaways and opinions on this attack surface, along with speculations on the future development of the Hyper-V DirectX component.
