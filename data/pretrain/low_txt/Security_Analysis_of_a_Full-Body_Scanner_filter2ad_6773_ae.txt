### A Radiation Dose Assessment

The Secure 1000 generates low-energy X-rays (50 kVp at 5 mA tube accelerating potential) to construct its images. Although this output is low, the machine still produces ionizing radiation, and careful assessment is necessary to ensure public safety.

#### Recent Findings and Manufacturer Claims

The imparted dose has been scrutinized recently by various agencies using different experimental designs [2, 14, 53]. These findings are consistent with manufacturer claims [38] that per-scan radiation exposure to subjects is non-zero but is near natural background levels. There have been concerns and counterclaims about the distribution of dose within the body, with some groups raising concerns that the scanner might impart a minimal deep dose but an overly large skin dose to the subject [5, 40, 43].

#### Experimental Design

To shed light on this question, we conducted a brief assessment of the radiological output of the scanner using Landauer Inc.’s InLight whole-body dosimeters. These dosimeters provide a shallow dose equivalent (SDE), a deep dose equivalent (DDE), and an eye lens dose equivalent. They are analyzed using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), an established dosimeter technology [9, 20]. We read the results using Landauer’s proprietary MicroStar dosimeter reader.

We used a simple experimental design to quantify the dose output: we arranged 21 dosimeters on a RANDO chest phantom positioned upright on a wooden table with a neck-to-floor distance of 144 cm and a source-to-detector distance of 66 cm, approximating the conditions of a normal scan. The dosimeters give a more accurate dose representation if the incident beam is perpendicular to the detector material. In this case, the dosimeters were attached to the chest phantom without regard for beam angle, and no correction factors were implemented; geometry issues were expected in the results.

The InLight dosimeters require a total dose of at least 50 µSv to be accurate. To irradiate them sufficiently, we performed 4033 consecutive single scans in the machine’s normal operating mode. Each screening consists of at least two such scans: one front and one rear. A scan was automatically triggered every 12 seconds and lasted 5.7 seconds, for a total beam-on time of 6 hours and 23 minutes.

We read the dosimeters the following day. A small loss of dose due to fade is expected, but for the purpose of this study, we regard this decrease as negligible. We applied the standard low-dose Cs-137 calibration suggested by Landauer. Initially, we were concerned that the low energy output of the scanner (50 kVp tube potential emits an X-ray spectrum centered roughly between 16 keV and 25 keV) would lead to inaccurate readings on the InLights. However, since the dosimeters are equipped with filters, the dose equation algorithm in the MicroStar reader can deduce beam energy without a correction factor applied to the 662 keV energy from the original calibration.

#### Results

The average DDE per scan for all the dosimeters was calculated to be 73.8 nSv. The average SDE per scan was 70.6 nSv, and the average eye-lens dose per scan was 77.9 nSv. The standard deviation (σ) and the coefficient of variation (CV) value of all the dosimeters for the DDE were 0.75 and 0.10, respectively (generally low variance). For the SDE and lens dose, σ and the CV were 1.26 and 0.16, and 2.08 and 0.29, respectively.

#### Unexpected Findings

An unexpected aspect of our results is that the measured DDE is higher than the SDE, which is worth further examination. The irradiation geometry of the dosimeters could possibly explain this irregularity. It might be productive to conduct further experiments that account for this effect.

#### Conclusion

The doses we measured are several times higher than those found in the recent AAPM Task Group 217 report [2], but they still equate to only nominal exposure: approximately equal to 24 minutes of natural background radiation and below the recommendation of 250 nSv per screening established by the applicable ANSI/HPS standard [3]. A person would have to undergo approximately 3200 scans per year to exceed the standard’s annual exposure limit of 250 µSv/year, a circumstance unlikely even for transportation workers and very frequent flyers.
