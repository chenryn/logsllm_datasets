The issue was initially identified by @teropa and subsequently confirmed in the ng2 directives for the Bootstrap project (refer to: [ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap#115](https://github.com/ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap/issues/115)):

"When using `TestComponentBuilder`, I encounter errors related to platform directives such as `ngFor`. It appears that these directives are not recognized as 'ambient' within the unit test environment, unlike during normal application execution. I have managed to resolve this by including `CORE_DIRECTIVES` in the component, but this solution feels counterintuitive. Does anyone have suggestions on how to make these directives available without resorting to this workaround?"

This refined version clarifies the context, provides a more structured presentation of the problem, and improves the overall readability and professionalism of the text.
