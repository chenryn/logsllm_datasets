**ATT&CK ID:** S0356  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** KONNI

KONNI has been observed to use `cmd.exe` to execute arbitrary commands on the infected host at various stages of the infection chain. This technique allows the malware to perform a wide range of actions, including but not limited to, file manipulation, process control, and data exfiltration. References for this behavior can be found in [183], [184], and [185].
