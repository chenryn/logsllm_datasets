### Analysis of Network Filtering Policies

**Summary of Findings:**
- **No Filtering:** 35%
- **Filtering:** 28%
- **Low Signal:** 13%
- **Muddled/No Filtering:** 7%
- **Multiple Policies:** 18%

**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **Low Signal (13%) and Muddled/No Filtering (7%):**
   - In some cases, we observe TCP/445 traffic but also indications that more such traffic should be present. This suggests the presence of both filtering and non-filtering policies within the same prefix.
   - For prefixes where we observe traffic from at least five infectees, we conclude that multiple policies are in place. This occurs in 18% of the cases.
   - In other cases, we observe TCP/445 traffic and some indication of additional traffic, but from fewer than five infectees. Here, we cannot conclusively determine that filtering is in use across the entire prefix. This "muddled" state is found in 7% of the prefixes.

2. **Fraction of Prefixes Used for Policy Determination:**
   - For each routed prefix, we calculate the fraction of constituent /24 blocks with known Conficker infectees and where we can conclusively determine the presence or absence of filtering.
   - Figure 3 shows the distribution of prefixes based on these fractions. The "all" distribution represents the expected prefix coverage based on the Conficker infectee list, while the "classified" distribution shows the fraction of /24 blocks used in concrete prefix classifications.
   - Comparing these distributions indicates that we generally use more of the prefix (i.e., more /24s) than the expectation predicts, which enhances our confidence in the classifications.

3. **Size of Routed Prefixes:**
   - Figure 4 presents the distribution of the size of all routed prefixes considered, as well as the sizes of routed prefixes for each concrete classification.
   - The distribution of network sizes for networks where we can concretely detect filtering policy is similar to the distribution of the size of all origin networks. This suggests that neither our detection nor results are biased by prefix size.
   - We find that networks that filter TCP/445 are slightly larger than those that do not, indicating that operators of larger networks may be more diligent about security policies.
   - Networks with multiple policies are also larger, which aligns with the natural tendency for larger networks to have multiple administrative and policy domains.

4. **Confidence in Single Filtering Policy:**
   - We can confidently determine a single filtering policy in roughly half of the /23 and larger routed prefixes, corresponding to 699M IP addresses or 28% of the routable addresses during the week of our darknet data collection.

### Limitations

**Detection of Network Outages and Policies:**
- Previous research has shown that full network outages, whether due to policy decisions or natural disasters, can be detected by the absence of traffic arriving at darknets.
- Our methodology can also infer finer-grained policies such as port blocking, but this requires significant events like a broad swath of the Internet becoming unreachable or the prevalence of energetic malware propagation.

**Background Radiation and Policy Inference:**
- To determine if background radiation provides enough information for general policy understanding, we analyzed the top TCP ports arriving at our darknet.
- Table 3 shows that even for the most prevalent port (TCP/80), we receive SYN packets from only 18% of observed /24s. This suggests that either 82% of /24s are subject to policy blocking or do not source radiation to port 80. The latter is more likely.
- For other top ports, the prevalence is even smaller, making any conclusions about policy tenuous.

**Conclusion:**
- While the technique of searching for the absence of traffic can be useful, it has its limits, especially for more common and less energetic instances of background radiation.

### Conclusions

**Key Contributions:**
- **Methodology:** We developed a novel methodology for detecting service-level network filtering based on passive observation of traffic markers. Using Conficker as an exemplar, we determined the network filtering policy for 699M IP addresses, or 28% of the routed IPv4 address space.
- **State of TCP/445:** Of the address space we assessed, two-thirds show filtering of outgoing TCP/445 traffic. Larger networks are more likely to have multiple service-level filtering policies.
- **Methodological Limitations:** There are limits to inferring policy from the absence of background radiation. Large events can be leveraged, but more routine instances of background radiation are not widespread enough to form reliable expectations and draw conclusions.
