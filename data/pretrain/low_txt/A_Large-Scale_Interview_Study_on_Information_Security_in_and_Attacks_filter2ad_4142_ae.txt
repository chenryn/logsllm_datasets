### 5. Discussion

In this section, we discuss our findings and, based on these, outline recommendations for industry, governments, and legislators, as well as suggestions for future research.

#### 5.1 Key Findings

In relation to our research questions, we summarize the following key findings:

**RQ1: How do company employees perceive the risk of cyberattacks?**

Generally, our interviewees did not perceive a high risk of cyberattacks for their companies. However, they perceived the risk of mass attacks higher than the risk of targeted attacks, especially in smaller companies. This lower perceived risk of targeted attacks may make these companies more susceptible to attacks such as CEO fraud or targeted ransomware (e.g., Emotet [9]), as well as insider threats.

**RQ2: Which and how frequent are information security measures deployed in SMEs?**

Most of our interviewees reported deploying technical measures such as firewalls and antivirus software, while organizational measures like certifications for information security were less frequently reported. We observed a high variance in reported organizational measures, with those requiring regular active engagement (e.g., information security training, risk analysis, or emergency drills) being less common.

The interview results reflect the complexity of companies and illustrate that information security is influenced by technological (e.g., maturity of measures), organizational (e.g., company size, corporate culture, or sector-specific security requirements), and individual (e.g., ability and willingness to provide, process, and share information) characteristics.

While our large-scale exploratory interview study provides insights into the impact of cybercrime on SMEs, it does not offer in-depth causal analyses of the identified phenomena. Therefore, our study provides a foundation for future research based on 5,000 interviews.

We provide the following ideas for future work and recommendations:
1. **For Researchers:**
   - Future research should investigate specific aspects of cybercrime and security measures detailed in Section 5.1.
   - The correlation between interviewee position in the company and reporting on both incidences and measures should be considered, particularly in smaller companies where some roles may be missing.
   - The discrepancy between technical and management staff in risk assessment and deployed measures should be explored further.
   - The low risk perception among participants, despite 40% of companies experiencing cybercrime in the last 12 months, warrants investigation. This could be due to misconceptions about what qualifies as cybercrime, low consequences from most types of cybercrime, or issues in tracking the consequences of cybercrime in SMEs.
   - An in-depth investigation into the correlation between industry sectors and incidents (as shown in Figure 5) could help improve security for these sectors or adapt approaches to other industries.
   - Future research should assess the maturity and internal spread of technical security measures within organizations, given their high reporting rates but varying implementation quality and effectiveness.

2. **For Companies:**
   - While we do not have concrete recommendations for specific security measures, our results indicate a strong correlation between organizational measures and low adoption, as seen in Figure 4. Companies should consider organizational measures like information security policies and employee training, evaluating which ones make sense for their business model.
   - Measures such as a security incident policy strongly correlate with reported incidents, as seen in Section 4.4. Management should spread this self-reported awareness to company staff and provide opportunities to raise information security awareness and participate in security training, especially for staff not directly involved in tech.

3. **For Governments/Legislators:**
   - Industries with high security requirements, such as Finance & Insurance and Energy & Gas, tend to report fewer incidents despite strong detection mechanisms. Governments can play a significant role in enhancing the security of small and medium enterprises.
   - Legislators should focus on areas with high incidence counts for certain attacks, as shown in Figure 5. For example, requirements for the Communication sector to implement security measures against DDoS attacks.
   - Our descriptive results in Section 4.2 show that risk awareness and assessment remain low. Legislators should actively work on increasing awareness of information security and the risks of cybercrime. In Germany, we are integrating survey results into a platform that provides information security guidelines and raises risk awareness for German companies in cooperation with a federal ministry.

### 6. Conclusion

In this study, we investigated the effects, mitigations, and risk assessments of cybercrime in small and medium-sized companies in Germany. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of German SMEs on this scale. Our findings reveal that security awareness has reached all SMEs, but this awareness is not yet widespread among all staff, often limited to management and tech departments, leaving SMEs vulnerable to phishing, insider attacks, and advanced persistent threats. We also discovered positive effects likely related to legislation for information security and used our results to formulate recommendations for employers, governments, and future research areas. In conclusion, cybersecurity awareness in Germany has arrived in SMEs, but the resulting measures and risk assessments are suboptimal, opening enterprises up to unnecessary attack surfaces.

### A. CATI Questionnaire

We provide a translation of the interview guide for our CATIs. It contains the questions in the form of "Question? (Choices→ Factor in Regression [B:Baseline]), (Scale)". The response options “not specified” and “I do not know” are available for any question but are not listed below. WZ08-Classification of the industries → Industry Sector [B:Construction] and headcount bins → Headcount were adopted from the underlying commercial sampling databases. For the full questions and supplementary material of the survey, please refer to Section 3.3.

#### A.1 "Company" - Introduction

1. In which area do you work in your company [multiple answers possible]? → Interviewee Position
   (Multiple Choice: Executive/Management Board, IT & Information Security, Data Protection, Plant Security, Audit, External Service Provider, Other [free text])

2. How high do you estimate the risk for your company to be harmed by a cyber-attack in the next 12 months...
   (... that also hits many other companies at the same time? [e.g., mass-sent malware], → Risk Assessment Untargeted;
   ... that exclusively affects your company? [e.g., targeted espionage attack]); → Risk Assessment Targeted (Scale: Very low, Rather low, Rather high, Very high)

#### A.2 "Incidence" - Detected Cyber-Attacks

1. Always related to the last 12 months: How often has your organization been affected by and had to actively respond to the following types of attacks?
   (Ransomware - which was intended to encrypt company data, → Ransomware Frequency;
   Phishing - attempts to obtain sensitive information, → Phishing Frequency;
   DDoS - Distributed Denial of Service, → DDoS Frequency;
   Insider Threats - malicious actions by current or former employees, → Insider Threats Frequency;
   Advanced Persistent Threats - long-term, targeted attacks, → APT Frequency)
