The limit type is [LimitType], address family is [AddressFamily], limit count is [LimitCount], and the reason type is [ReasonType]. This log is supported only by the service LSs in LS mode.

46. **FEI_MPLS/4/MPLS_INSEGMENT_DROP:**
    - **原始描述:** Many packets fail to match entries in the insegment table.(slotid=[slotid], LabelNum=[LabelNum], label1=[label1], label2=[label2], label3=[label3], label4=[label4], label5=[label5], label6=[label6], label7=[label7], label8=[label8], label9=[label9], label10=[label10]) In VS mode, this log is supported only by the admin VS. In LS mode, this log is not supported.
    - **优化后描述:** Many packets have failed to match entries in the insegment table on slot [slotid]. The labels involved are [label1], [label2], [label3], [label4], [label5], [label6], [label7], [label8], [label9], and [label10]. This log is supported only by the admin VS in VS mode and is not supported in LS mode.

47. **PKI/6/TIMEOUT_CRL_ERR:**
    - **原始描述:** CRL ([crlName]) will be expired in [numOfDays] days. In LS mode, this log is supported by both the admin LS and service LSs.
    - **优化后描述:** The CRL [crlName] will expire in [numOfDays] days. This log is supported by both the admin LS and service LSs in LS mode.

48. **MSDP/4/MSDP_SA_LIMIT:**
    - **原始描述:** In the VPN instance, the number of (S, G) entries learned from an MSDP peer exceeded the maximum number of entries allowed by the SA cache. (
