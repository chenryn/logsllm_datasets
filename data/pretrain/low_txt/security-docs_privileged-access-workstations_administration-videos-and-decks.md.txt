# Microsoft Security Best Practices Module: Privileged Administration

Administrative accounts with privileged access to the environment, including associated groups and workstations, must be protected at the highest levels of security to ensure that all other security measures are not compromised. For more information, see the [Administration](critical-impact-accounts.md) topic.

The following videos provide detailed guidance on privileged administration. You can also download the [PowerPoint slides](/microsoft-365/downloads/security-compass-presentation.pptx) associated with these videos for further reference.
