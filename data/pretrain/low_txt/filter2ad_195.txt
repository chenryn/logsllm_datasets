## Abstract
Information-centric networking (ICN) integrates content replication services into a future Internet layer. Current ICN concepts either use dynamic mapping to direct content requests to nearby copies or immediate routing based on content identifiers. This paper evaluates the performance of content-centric routing through practical experiments, focusing on conceptual aspects. Our findings indicate that the performance of content distribution systems is significantly impacted by the heavy management of states, which arise from the strong coupling of the control and data planes in the underlying routing infrastructure.

## 1. Introduction
The global distribution of content in large volumes is a primary function of today's Internet. Content distribution networks (CDNs) facilitate efficient, wide-area replication of static data for selected content providers. However, the end-to-end design of TCP/IP does not inherently support implicit replication and in-network storage. There is no standard solution for the asynchronous, global replication of popular content in the current Internet. Information-Centric Networking (ICN) proposes to address this gap.

Two main approaches to routing exist in current ICN proposals: an evolutionary path that routes on IP, and "clean slate" concepts that route on content identities. NetInf extends the current Internet with a resolution service that maps content names to topological IDs like IP addresses. TRIAD, DONA, and NDN perform content retrieval by routing on names, with responses and data forwarded along reverse paths (RPF). This can be done using IP as a lower layer or without IP but with dedicated RPF states.

Operating on the content itself forces network infrastructure to become content-aware. A mapping service is required not only to resolve names to source locations but also to advise on nearby replicas, which it learns from the data distribution system. Content routers must rely on names in their interface tables and, for RPF-based forwarding schemes, maintain a reverse state for every data unit. This control information is highly dynamic and requires regular updates from the data plane. The ICN paradigm thus opens the control plane to continuous modifications from the data plane, in contrast to the current Internet, where DNS and routing states remain unaltered by data-driven events.

In this paper, we briefly present our study [2] of the joint control and data plane behavior under varying data conditions, using NDN [3] as an example. We are particularly interested in the response of the ICN infrastructure to load. Experiments were conducted in test networks running PARC’s CCNx software, revealing a performance flaw (by concept, not implementation) with increasing demands on the routing system.

## 2. Basic Measurement Setup
For our measurement study, we used the CCNx implementation version 0.5.1 [4], including the client library to announce content interests, the content repository to store data, and the ccnd to forward subscriptions and data. Our analysis focuses on the effects on the router side. Although the measurements primarily relate to the ccnd, we do not evaluate the implementation but use it as a real-world instance of an information-centric network deployment to illustrate protocol mechanisms. To gain a fine-grained view, we concentrate on the local system and inter-router dependencies.

The basic network topology consists of a chain of two CCNx routers directly interlinked at 100 Mbit/s, with one end connecting the content consumer and the other the content repository. We used default values for all CCNx parameters. CCNx routers communicate via TCP.

## 3. Results
To analyze the performance of content consumption, the content receiver initiates parallel downloads of multiple 10 Mbit files over a constant time. We considered three scenarios: requesting 2 files, 10 files, and 100 files per second. Figure 1 shows the start and completion time of the download per file, the Pending Interest Table (PIT) size, the number of Interest retransmissions, and the traffic load, including the mean goodput at the first hop.

With an increasing number of parallel downloads, the download time increases significantly, and the interval between the request and receive phases grows in overload scenarios. While the download time is almost constant for two files per second (Fig. 1(a)), the stop time diverges non-linearly from the beginning of the download in cases of excessive parallelism (Fig. 1(b), (c)). In the worst case, 150 seconds are needed to download each single file (Fig. 1(c)), while the link capacity would permit retrieving all files in about 10 seconds.

The reason for this performance issue is visualized in the sub-graphs. A higher download frequency leads to an increasing number of simultaneous PIT entries, requiring coordination with the data plane. Each file request is split into multiple chunk requests, and the generation of corresponding interest messages is pipelined. As content traverses, Interest states dissolve and release memory. These operations cause continuous state maintenance triggered by data traversal and a simultaneous burst in CPU load (CPU exhaustion not shown). This results in growing Interest retransmissions after droppings or timeouts, leading to retransmissions of data chunks. Overall, network utilization fluctuates significantly but does not adapt to actual user demands: even though data requests could fill the links easily, the average load remains about constant at 30%.

## 4. Conclusions and Discussions
We have analyzed content-centric routing performance under varying loads and closely examined the implications of data-driven state management. The exhaustion of memory and processing resources due to excessive state allocations was identified as a major reason for service degradation. It is important to note that these effects are not shortcomings of the CCNx implementation but are driven by the concept. Resource-intensive state management opens the door to DoS attacks, with threats arising from resource exhaustion, state decorrelation, and path and name infiltration [2].

An obvious approach to mitigate resource exhaustion is to limit the rates of state injection into the network. Applying restrictions per user will require addressing and tracking of end nodes, leading to traffic shaping and bandwidth restrictions. As content states accumulate in the network and inter-provider deployment leads to a heterogeneous, unbalanced network, rate limiting may help but cannot effectively prevent the resource exhaustion problems discussed in this paper. Conceptual changes seem necessary to make content-centric networking scalable, robust, and resistant to infrastructure attacks.
