### Web Ecosystem: Back-Office Traffic Estimation

#### 6. BACK-OFFICE TRAFFIC: ESTIMATION
The raw number of IP addresses involved in back-office activities does not provide a complete picture of the volume of back-office traffic observed from our vantage points. This section focuses on estimating the volume of this traffic.

#### 6.1 Across Vantage Points
The methodology outlined in Section 4 allows us to classify IP addresses as Web crawlers, auctioneers, bidders, and intermediaries such as CDPs (Customer Data Platforms). With this classification, we can now quantify the amount of back- and front-office Web traffic. For a packet to be classified as back-office traffic, both the source and destination must have been previously identified as part of the back-office ecosystem. Specifically, the source IP address must be identified as belonging to an intermediary, crawler, or auctioneer, and the destination IP:port pair must match one of our identified Web server endpoints. We then tag this packet as back-office traffic, issued by the source (i.e., a crawler, auctioneer, CDP, or other intermediary).

Recall from Section 4 that we use passive and active measurements to uncover intermediaries, manual identification for crawlers and auctioneers, and a list of CDN servers. To account for varying degrees of certainty with these data sets, we distinguish between three different classes when quantifying back-office traffic:
- **IPs-CDN**: Back-office traffic caused by servers in our CDN data set.
- **IPs-DPI+Manual**: Back-office traffic caused by servers identified using DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) and manual inspection.
- **IPs-ZMap**: Back-office traffic caused by servers identified using the ZMap data set.

**Figure 4(a)** shows the percentage of back-office traffic relative to total Web traffic for each vantage point, depicted as a stacked bar plot. The bars represent the volume of back-office traffic found using different methods:
- **Bottom Bar**: Information from the CDN only.
- **Middle Bar**: Information from the IPs-CDN and IPs-DPI+Manual.
- **Top Bar**: All information including ZMap.

Across all vantage points, we observe at least 5% back-office Web traffic using the IPs-CDN and IPs-DPI+Manual sets of IPs, confirming that back-office Web traffic is a significant contributor to todayâ€™s Internet Web traffic. Even when using only the IPs-CDN data set, we see at least 4% back-office traffic at all vantage points except for L-IXP. This variability may be due to routing changes, operational changes in application infrastructure, or changes in the popularity of Web applications. Additionally, we observe more variability for individual backbone links compared to IXPs, likely because IXPs aggregate information from thousands of peering links.

**Table 5** provides a detailed classification of back-office Web traffic, showing the contributions of CDPs, auctioneers, crawlers, and other intermediaries.

#### 6.2 Across Peering Links
The two backbone traces illustrate notable differences in the percentages of back-office bytes and requests on different links, suggesting the need to examine each link individually. We leverage our ability to dissect traffic seen on hundreds of individual AS-AS links at L-IXP.

**Figure 5(a)** shows the fractions of back-office traffic per AS-AS link, sorted by the fraction of back-office Web traffic. The fractions vary drastically from 100% to 0%. Specifically, 18.2% (10.9%) of the peering links carry more than 15% (7%) back-office bytes when using the IPs-ZMap + IPs-DPI+Manual (IPs-DPI+Manual) data set. Conversely, 25.5% (40.8%) of the peering links carry no back-office traffic at all. A closer inspection of the top-10 traffic-carrying links with more than 95% back-office traffic reveals four links between cloud providers and content providers, three links between search engines and hosting providers, two links between CDNs and content providers, and one link between a content provider and an online advertisement company. This analysis highlights the diversity of players contributing to back-office Web traffic.

When aggregating the information to the level of IXP member-ASes, the overall observation changes slightly, as shown in **Figure 5(b)**. No member ASes exchange only back-office Web traffic; they all have at least 20% front-office Web traffic. However, most have some fraction of back-office traffic. There are 19.2% (18.0%) of the members with more than 15% (7%) back-office bytes for the IPs-ZMap + IPs-DPI+Manual (IPs-DPI+Manual) data set. Among the networks with the highest share of back-office traffic are cloud providers, hosting providers, a search engine, and an advertisement company.

#### Summary
Our findings indicate a significant percentage of back-office Web traffic in our traces, though this percentage varies across vantage points. Back-office traffic over backbone links is primarily dominated by CDPs. At IXPs, where multiple links are monitored simultaneously, back-office traffic is also largely due to CDPs and other intermediaries, with real-time bidding and crawling contributing a significant share of bytes and Web requests. Our analysis illustrates the dynamic nature of back-office traffic, which can vary significantly over time and across different network links.
