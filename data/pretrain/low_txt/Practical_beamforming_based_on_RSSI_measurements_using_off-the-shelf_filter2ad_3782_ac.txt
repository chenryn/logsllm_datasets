# Beamforming and Its Impact on Wireless Link Quality and Transport Layer Performance

## 1. Introduction
Beamforming is a technique that improves the signal strength and connectivity in wireless networks by focusing the transmission energy in specific directions. This paper evaluates the performance benefits of beamforming at both the link and transport layers, using experimental data.

## 2. Experimental Setup and Results

### 2.1 Link Layer Performance

**Figure 3: Beamforming Improves Link Quality**

- **(a) RSSI Gain**: The Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) shows significant improvement with beamforming. The RSSI gain is consistently higher across all locations.
- **(b) Throughput**: The throughput increases significantly with beamforming. For example, the downlink UDP throughput increases from an average of 0.9 Mbps to 22.1 Mbps, and the TCP throughput increases from 1.06 Mbps to 14.2 Mbps.
- **(c) CRC Errors**: The Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) error rate decreases, indicating improved data integrity.

### 2.2 Transport Layer Performance

**Figure 4: Transport Layer Performance**

- **(a) Downlink Throughput**: Beamforming significantly improves downlink throughput for both UDP and TCP. The average downlink throughput increases from 0.9 Mbps to 22.1 Mbps for UDP and from 1.06 Mbps to 14.2 Mbps for TCP.
- **(b) Uplink Throughput**: The uplink throughput improvements are smaller due to the fixed rate of ACK packets in the 802.11 standard. The uplink throughput increases from 1.0 Mbps to 5.0 Mbps for UDP and from 1.0 Mbps to 7.0 Mbps for TCP.
- **(c) Delay Performance**: Beamforming reduces the packet round trip delay. The average delay is reduced from 6.5 ms to 1.3 ms, and the standard deviation in delay is reduced from 2.49 ms to 0.28 ms.

## 3. Discussion

### 3.1 MIMO Clients

While this work focuses on clients with omnidirectional antennas, the use of multiple antennas at the client side (e.g., IEEE 802.11n) is becoming more common. Adaptive beamforming can be used in conjunction with other techniques like spatial multiplexing. Channel estimation, as developed in this work, remains crucial even with MIMO. Future work could explore more optimized variants of the current procedure.

## 4. Conclusions

This study demonstrates that beamforming, using power measurements and an intelligent estimation technique, can achieve significant performance benefits without excessive complexity. The ability to exploit the multipath channel through simple RSSI measurements opens up several interesting research directions, such as extending beamforming to serve multiple users and improving spatial reuse and interference management.
