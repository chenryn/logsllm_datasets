2. **Channel Open Attempts:**
   - At 17:55:26, the QuorumCnxManager failed to open a channel to server 2 at the election address (IP: 10.10.34.12, Port: 3888).

3. **Session Establishment and Termination:**
   - At 18:18:01, a new session was attempted by a client (IP: 10.10.34.12, Port: 43125).
   - Multiple session terminations were processed:
     - At 18:18:02, session with ID `0x14ede63a5a70002` was terminated.
     - At 18:18:30, session with ID `0x34ede65503f0010` was terminated.
     - At 19:50:32, session with ID `0x14ede63a5a70023` was terminated.
     - At 19:59:08, session with ID `0x34ede65503f002b` was terminated.
     - At 20:06:34, session with ID `0x24ede63a01b003b` was expired due to a timeout of 10,000 ms.
     - At 20:13:46, session with ID `0x34ede65503f0036` was expired due to a timeout of 10,000 ms.
     - At 20:34:58, session with ID `0x14ede63a5a7003a` was terminated.

4. **Socket Connection Issues:**
   - At 19:50:21, 20:17:12, and 21:03:35, the NIOServerCnxn caught end-of-stream exceptions.
   - At 21:03:35, the NIOServerCnxn closed a socket connection for a client (IP: 10.10.34.13, Port: 38088) with session ID `0x14ede63a5a70048`.

**Summary:**
- The ZooKeeperServer is managing session establishment and termination, with multiple sessions being terminated and a few being established.
- There are several warnings about connection requests from old clients, which will be dropped if the server is in read-only mode.
- The QuorumCnxManager encountered an issue while trying to open a channel to another server.
- The NIOServerCnxn is experiencing end-of-stream exceptions and closing socket connections.
