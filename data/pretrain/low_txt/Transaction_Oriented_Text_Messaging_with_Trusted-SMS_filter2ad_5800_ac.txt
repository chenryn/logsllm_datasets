### Implementation and Performance Characteristics

The performance of different phones' Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP) implementations can vary significantly. Therefore, the best-performing approach on one phone may not be optimal on another. Our analysis focuses on the execution speed of the cryptographic library used in the Trusted-SMS framework, specifically the Bouncycastle library. The performance analysis evaluates all supported elliptic curves that comply with NIST recommendations [27] to identify the most suitable curve.

#### Elliptic Curves Evaluated:

- **Binary Fields:**
  - EC163(1)
  - EC233(2)
  - EC283(3)
  - EC409(4)
  - EC571(5)

- **Prime Fields:**
  - EC192(1)
  - EC224(2)
  - EC239(3)
  - EC256(4)
  - EC384(5)
  - EC521(6)

#### Operations Evaluated:

- Key generation
- Signature generation
- Signature verification
- Plaintext encryption
- Plaintext decryption

### Results and Analysis

All results were obtained by replicating each operation 50 times on a Nokia N70 device (Symbian OS v. 8.1a, Series 60 2nd edition, CPU ARM-926 220 MHz). The Nokia N70 is representative of many Nokia devices currently on the market, including the E Series and N Series, which use the same processor.

#### Key Generation

- **Figure 1:** ECC key generation time
- **Observation:** Curves over prime fields perform better than those over binary fields.
- **Conclusion:** For key pair generation at each power-on, prime field curves are preferred. The first four prime field curves (EC192, EC224, EC239, and EC256) keep the average key generation time below 5 seconds.

#### Signature Generation and Verification

- **Figures 2 and 3:** ECC signature generation and verification time
- **Observation:** EC256 is excluded due to its 15-second verification time.
- **Conclusion:** The candidate set is reduced to three curves: EC192, EC224, and EC239.

#### Encryption and Decryption

- **Figures 4 and 5:** ECC plaintext encryption and decryption time
- **Observation:** EC224 performs 25% better than EC239.
- **Conclusion:** Further restriction of the candidate set excludes EC239, leaving EC192 and EC224.

### Final Candidate Set

- **Candidate Curves:**
  - EC192
  - EC224

#### Security, SMS Length, and Usability

- **Table 2:** Performance comparison between RSA and ECC based on key size
- **Security Level:**
  - 160-bit ECC is comparable to 1024-bit RSA.
  - 210-bit ECC is comparable to 2048-bit RSA.
- **SMS Space:**
  - 160-bit ECC requires 40 bytes (28% of SMS space).
  - 210-bit ECC requires 54 bytes (38% of SMS space).

### Selected Curve

- **Final Selection:** EC192 over prime field
- **Reasons:**
  - Meets performance needs for all cryptographic operations.
  - Comparable to a 1024-bit RSA cryptosystem.

### Current and Future Use of SMS

- **Current Uses:**
  - Payment (e.g., PayPal, Gpay)
  - Alerts and notifications (e.g., Italian Foreign Minister, NISA)
  - Phishing (SMiShing)
  - Authentication (Wireless Hotspots)
  - Employment-related messages (e.g., off-duty, firing)
  - Interactive shopping (e.g., Shoptext.com)

- **Future Work:**
  - Understanding the cost of reverse engineering a Java Midlet.
  - Benchmarking and improving performance using crypto APIs in native language with RMI (versus Bouncycastle).
  - Storing keying material on the SIM card or a tamper-proof external card (SD/MMC).
