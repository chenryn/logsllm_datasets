The code successfully passes all tests; however, there is no confirmation message indicating the completion of the bonfire, and the bonfire is not being marked as completed on the map. I have attached screenshots from both the "Sum of All Odd Fibonacci Numbers" and "Binary Agents" bonfires, which exhibit the same issue. This problem only occurs with some bonfires, while others function correctly. The issue has been observed on both macOS and Linux Mint, using the Firefox browser.

Please find the attached screenshots for reference:
