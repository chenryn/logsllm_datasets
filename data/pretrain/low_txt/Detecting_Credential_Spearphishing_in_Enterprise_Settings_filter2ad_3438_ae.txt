### Detector for Selecting Entire Batches

The detector can be used to select entire batches of emails that share the same DAS (Detection Anomaly Score).

### Extending to Preventative Protection

Our real-time detector can be extended to provide preventative protection. As emails arrive, the detector computes each email's feature values and checks each URL within the email to determine if it would generate an alert if clicked at that moment. If a URL is flagged, the email's URL can be rewritten (before delivery) to redirect to an interstitial warning page set up by the enterprise's security team. Our calculations show that with a budget of 10 alerts per day, an employee would encounter a median of 2 interstitial pages over nearly 4 years of our evaluation data (Appendix B). Given this low burden, future work could explore designing effective warning mechanisms as part of a preventative defense.

### Related Work

Recent research has highlighted the threat of spearphishing and explored potential defenses [8, 12, 19, 24]. The systems proposed by Stringhini et al. [19], Duman et al. [8], and Khonji et al. [12] build behavioral models for senders based on metadata, stylometry, and timing features. These models classify emails as spearphishing or not by comparing new email features against the sender's historical profile. However, these systems cannot detect spearphishing from previously unseen attackers due to the lack of historical data. Additionally, when evaluated on smaller datasets with simulated attacks, the best-performing detectors have false positive rates (FPRs) in the range of 1-10%. Even a 1% FPR is too high for practical enterprise settings, as it would lead to 2,500 alerts per day in a dataset with over 250,000 emails. In contrast, our detector can detect real-world attacks, including those from previously unseen attackers, with a budget of 10 alerts per day.

Other studies have characterized spearphishing attacks against individual activists and dissidents [9, 15, 16, 20]. These attacks range from simple third-party tracking software and common exploits to purchasing specialized spyware and exploits from commercial firms. LeBlond et al. [14] conducted a large-scale analysis of exploit documents used in targeted attacks, finding that none of the malicious attachments used zero-day exploits, and over 95% relied on vulnerabilities at least one year old. While such attacks can succeed against vulnerable individuals, they are likely to fail against enterprises with good security hygiene. Indeed, all recent spearphishing attacks on LBNL have been credential spearphishing.

### Conclusion

In this work, we developed a real-time detector for identifying credential spearphishing attacks in enterprise settings. Two key contributions enabled our detector to achieve practical performance: (1) a new set of features targeting the two fundamental stages of successful spearphishing attacks, and (2) a new anomaly detection technique that leverages these features without requiring labeled training data. We evaluated our approach on an anonymized dataset of over 370 million emails collected from a large national lab. At a false positive rate of less than 0.005%, our system detected all but two attacks in the dataset and uncovered two previously unknown successful attacks. Compared to standard anomaly detection techniques, our approach requires significantly fewer false positives to detect the same attacks. Due to its ability to detect a wide range of attacks, including previously undiscovered ones, and its low false positive cost, LBNL has implemented and deployed a version of our detector.

### Appendix B: Preventative Interstitials

In Section 7, we discussed extending our detector to a preventative defense by rewriting suspicious URLs in emails to redirect to an interstitial page. To assess the practicality of this defense, we ran our detector on our entire evaluation dataset (September 1, 2013 – January 14, 2017) with an average daily budget of 10 alerts. We selected the top 12,310 most suspicious click-in-email events. For each recipient (RCPT TO email address) that received these emails, we computed the number of alerts they received over the entire evaluation time window. Figures 8 and 9 show these results in histogram and CDF form.

**Figure 8:** Histogram of alerts per RCPT TO address for our detector using an average budget of 10 alerts per day across the September 1, 2013 – January 14, 2017 timeframe.

**Figure 9:** CDF of alerts per RCPT TO address for our detector using an average budget of 10 alerts per day across the September 1, 2013 – January 14, 2017 timeframe.

From these figures, we see that over 95% of employees would see fewer than 10 interstitials across the entire time span of nearly 3.5 years.
