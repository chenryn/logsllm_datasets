### Experiment Details

In this experiment, we evaluate the mixing time of social networks by comparing sampling and lower-bound measurements. The following settings are used:

1. **Social Graph Size:**
   - We know the size of the social graphs, both in terms of nodes (\(n\)) and edges (\(m\)).
   - We select a proper value for \(r\) that guarantees a high probability of intersection, using the birthday paradox formula.

2. **Experiment Setup:**
   - We consider the case without an attacker, as SybilLimit bounds the number of Sybil identities based on the number of attacker edges.
   - We increase \(t\) (the walk length) until the number of accepted nodes by a trusted node (verifier) reaches almost all honest nodes in the social network.
   - With this \(t\), we find the average total variation distance required in each graph, which is necessary for the operation of these designs.
   - The number of accepted Sybil identities is computed as \(t \times g\), where \(g\) is the number of attack edges.
   - SybilLimit works as long as \(t < n/w\).

**Results:**
- The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 8. For more details, see [17].

### Conclusion

In this paper, we measured the mixing times of several online and information social networks, which can be used for building security defenses and communication systems. Our main findings show that these social networks generally have much slower mixing times than previously anticipated. Additionally, we observed that the average mixing time is better than the worst-case mixing time, which is the standard definition of the mixing time of a random walk on a graph. However, the average mixing time is still much higher than the ones being used.

**Future Work:**
- We will investigate building theoretical models that consider the average case of the mixing time.
- We will also investigate cost models that consider the different mixing times of social graphs and their relation to the trust model exhibited in such networks to evaluate the overall effectiveness of designs based on social networks.
- This future work is motivated by the observation that some social graphs mix faster than others while their underlying trust is different.
