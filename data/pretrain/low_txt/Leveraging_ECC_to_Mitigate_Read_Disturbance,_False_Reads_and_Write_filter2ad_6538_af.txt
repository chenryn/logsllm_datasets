**Observations:**
- When read disturbance mitigation is more important, WAE and WAP achieve the best performance.

### VIII. Sensitivity Analysis

In Section VII-B, we demonstrated that a high incidence of user writes can mitigate the destructive effects of read disturbances. However, heavily read data (e.g., 1000 reads or more to one write) can still cause cumulative error effects due to read disturbance. Additionally, results in Section VII-D show that the ERP for different mitigation approaches depends on the ratios of raw bit error rates \( p_f \), \( p_d \), and \( p_w \) due to circuit parameters in STT-RAM. The type of dominant error rate significantly influences overall system performance for different error mitigation policies.

We now explore the ERP of these different approaches systematically, varying \( p_d \), \( p_f \), and \( p_w \) in three modes: high, medium, and low. Figure 13 plots the ERP of different approaches against these three modes.

- **Figure 13 (a):** ERP of different approaches when \( p_w \) has the highest bit error rate (varying between \( 10^{-6} \) and \( 10^{-4} \)), and \( p_d \) and \( p_f \) have medium (varying between \( 10^{-8} \) and \( 10^{-6} \)) and low (varying between \( 10^{-10} \) and \( 10^{-8} \)) error rates, respectively.
- **Figure 13 (b):** ERP when \( p_f \) is the highest bit error rate.
- **Figure 13 (c):** ERP when \( p_d \) is the highest bit error rate.

**Characterization of ERP versus Raw Bit Error Rates:**
- **User Read-Write Ratio (a = 99%, b = 0.1%):**
  - **When \( p_w \) is the highest bit error rate:**
    - WAT achieves the best performance because it writes back less, avoiding the high \( p_w \). However, if the system experiences enough cells with incorrect data from \( p_w \) and \( p_d \), it will write back to eliminate accumulated errors.
    - WAR performs poorly in terms of both energy and reliability, making it the worst approach. Its negative impact on latency due to high memory write bandwidth makes it unsuitable for systems with high \( p_w \).
  - **When \( p_f \) is the highest bit error rate:**
    - If \( p_d \) is the lowest bit error rate, WAT achieves the best ERP, reduced by more than three orders of magnitude compared to WAE and WAP, and eight orders of magnitude smaller than WAR.
    - If \( p_d \approx p_f \), WAE, WAP, and WAT have similar ERPs, all better than WAR. The destructive effects of \( p_d \) degrade the energy reliability advantage of WAT relative to the case where \( p_f \gg p_d \).
  - **When \( p_d \) is the highest bit error rate:**
    - WAR has the best ERP because writing back the data block consistently provides a significant reliability advantage that outweighs the energy savings.
    - As long as \( p_w \) is the lowest bit error rate, WAT obtains the worst ERP because the combination of \( p_f \) and \( p_d \) leads to a higher incidence of multiple errors after a single error is left behind.
    - If \( p_f \) is the lowest bit error rate (\( p_d > p_w > p_f \)), the performance of WAE and WAP degrades exponentially.

### IX. Conclusion

Spin-Transfer Torque Random Access Memory (STT-RAM) is a leading candidate in emerging memory technologies. However, its relatively unreliable reads due to read disturbances degrade system reliability and hinder integration into the memory stack. This paper compares three approaches to mitigate read disturbances in STT-RAM: writing back after every read (WAR), writing back after any error (WAE), after a persistent error (WAP), or after multiple errors (WAT). These approaches aim to improve overall memory system reliability by addressing read disturbance, write faults, and false read errors using a single ECC.

**Key Findings:**
1. **WAT:** Achieves the best energy reliability trade-off when the false read error rate or the write bit error rate is dominant.
2. **WAE:** Achieves acceptable reliability and energy levels as long as read disturbance is not dominant.
3. **WAP:** Has energy and reliability similar to WAE, as long as read disturbance is not dominant.
4. **WAR:** Does not offer a significant reliability advantage over other policies when read disturbance is not dominant and has the highest energy and memory bandwidth overheads.

In summary, WAE, WAP, and WAT provide significant improvements in energy consumption and memory bandwidth while maintaining near-WAR reliability.
