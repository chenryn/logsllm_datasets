## Abstract
Flexible display devices enable users to interact with the device by deforming the display surface to trigger commands. As these devices become mainstream, such as in smartphones, e-readers, or tablets, they will require robust authentication mechanisms for user verification. In this poster, we present an authentication scheme designed for flexible display devices, its implementation on a prototype, and the results of an ongoing user study evaluating the usability and security of our system.

## 1. Introduction
Flexible display devices allow users to interact with the device by deforming the display surface to trigger commands. Potential applications include gaming, media control, home appliances, and smartphones. While not yet widely available, several prototypes have been developed to explore their interaction modalities. For instance, Lahey et al. created PaperPhone, a flexible display smartphone, and proposed a classification scheme for bend gestures based on location and polarity. Kildal et al. developed the Kinetic device, a deformable mobile phone, and provided design guidelines for deformable devices. As flexible displays become more common, they will need effective authentication methods.

In this poster, we present an authentication scheme that leverages users' motor learning capabilities. We also demonstrate the implementation of this scheme on a flexible display prototype. To our knowledge, no prior work has investigated authentication schemes specifically for flexible display devices. Our main contributions are:
- Design and implementation of an authentication scheme on a flexible display prototype.
- Ongoing user study to evaluate the usability and security of our authentication scheme, comparing it to a PIN-based system.

## 2. Related Work
While there is no prior research on authentication mechanisms for flexible display devices, some studies have explored password creation using motor learning. Bianchi et al. developed the Haptic Wheel and the Secure Haptic Keypad, which use vibrotactile cues (tactons) for authentication. Chong et al. introduced GesturePIN, a mobile authentication system that uses 3D gestures. Mott et al. created TangibleRubik, an authentication mechanism that requires physical manipulation of a Rubik's Cube. These systems leverage motor learning to enhance password recall and security.

## 3. Prototypes
We developed two prototypes: a flexible display for gesture-based passwords and a mobile phone for PINs.

### 3.1 Flexible Display
Our flexible display prototype consists of a soft PVC display with four 2" Flexpoint bidirectional bend sensors, a pico projector, an Arduino Uno Microcontroller, and a control panel. The pico projector displays a UI onto the flexible display, and the control panel manages the authentication process. The display and control panel are connected to the Arduino, which interfaces with a computer running the software for creating gesture-based passwords.

#### 3.1.1 Creating a Password
Passwords are created by performing a series of bend gestures. A set of 20 gestures is available, including single and dual corner bends. The UI displays a standard password entry field, with an asterisk appearing for each gesture. Passwords must be at least 5 gestures long, providing 21.6 bits of entropy.

### 3.2 Mobile Phone
The mobile phone prototype, developed using Android, allows users to create PINs. The UI matches that of the flexible display prototype. PINs must be at least 6 characters long, providing 19.9 bits of entropy.

## 4. User Study
We are conducting a user study to evaluate the usability and security of our authentication mechanism. Participants complete two sessions. In the first session, they create a gesture-based password on the flexible display and a PIN on the mobile phone, presented in a counterbalanced order. After familiarizing themselves with the prototypes, participants complete post-task questionnaires and re-enter their passwords five times to aid memorization.

The second session, held a week later, assesses password memorability. Participants re-enter their passwords, and qualitative and quantitative data are collected through post-task questionnaires and task performance metrics.

### 4.1 Preliminary Results - Day 1
Sixteen university students (M = 22, SD = 3.42) participated in the first session. On average, participants took longer to re-enter their password on the flexible display (M = 31.2s, SD = 18.08) compared to the mobile phone (M = 7.2s, SD = 3.42). This difference can be attributed to the novelty of the technology and the familiarity of PINs. Most participants successfully re-entered their passwords, and post-task questionnaires indicated a positive experience with the flexible display prototype.

## 5. Conclusion and Future Work
We presented an authentication scheme for flexible display devices, implemented it on a prototype, and conducted a user study to evaluate its usability and security. Preliminary results show that while users can create and re-enter passwords, they take longer on the flexible display due to the new technology. Future work will analyze data from both sessions, focusing on the security and memorability of passwords and the gestural patterns used.
