### Research on Hardware Security Keys

The primary focus of the research has been on hardware security keys. In a laboratory study involving 94 participants, Lyastani et al. [32] examined user perceptions of using FIDO2-compatible hardware security keys as a single factor for authentication. Participants were randomly assigned to register and sign into a website using either a security key or a site-specific password. Generally, participants preferred the security key over traditional passwords but identified several limitations. They expressed concerns about hardware issues, such as the lack of USB ports on some computers. Additionally, they desired features for recovery and revocation if the security key was lost. As expected, participants' mental models of FIDO2 lacked the intuitive understanding associated with traditional passwords.

In a field setting, Farke et al. [18] observed the authentication routines of 10 employees in a small software company. Employees had the option to use a FIDO2-compatible security key or a traditional password for logging in. Over four weeks, several employees stopped using the security key, perceiving its security benefits as unnecessary and finding it slower than using their browser’s password manager.

Oogami et al. [40] conducted a study with 10 participants who used biometric WebAuthn to register their Android phones with their existing Yahoo! Japan accounts. Some participants were confused by the user interface, often mistaking the on-screen fingerprint icon for the actual fingerprint sensor. While this study highlighted usability issues with biometric WebAuthn, the small sample size limited the generalizability of the findings.

### Usability Drawbacks of FIDO2 and WebAuthn

Regardless of the use of biometrics, FIDO2 and WebAuthn have several usability drawbacks [2, 33, 41, 42, 54]. The inability to transfer private keys across devices requires users to register multiple times (e.g., on both a phone and laptop). There is no secure fallback if authenticators are lost or broken, shifting the problem from primary to fallback authentication. Furthermore, there is no security benefit if insecure methods, like passwords, remain valid even after FIDO2 is enabled.

### Misconceptions About Biometrics

While we are among the first to study the use of biometrics within FIDO2 and WebAuthn, prior work has investigated users’ mental models of biometric authentication in other contexts. We highlight and number key misconceptions identified in prior work, which we investigate in our user studies.

1. **Usability Factors**: Several user studies have examined misconceptions about using biometrics to unlock smartphones [9, 12, 34, 36, 57]. De Luca et al. [14] found that usability was a major factor in choosing biometrics, with Apple’s Touch ID considered easy and fast. Interestingly, security and privacy concerns did not significantly influence decisions about adopting biometric unlocking.
   
2. **Storage Location**: Bhagavatula et al. [7] reported misconceptions about the storage location of biometrics, with some participants thinking that biometrics were sent over the network or to the cloud even when unlocking the phone. This misconception is a focus of our study, as we expect it to heavily influence perceptions.

3. **Security Perception**: Participants often considered biometric authentication more secure than PINs, not realizing that PINs remained enabled as a fallback. Many were unaware of security risks like spoofing.

4. **Spoofing Risks**: To further explore misconceptions about biometric phone unlocking, Wolf et al. [63] conducted semi-structured interviews. Both experts and non-experts expressed concerns about biometric data being accessed by third parties. They also highlighted misunderstandings around using multiple devices, delegating access to others, and the availability of biometrics due to wet or oily fingers.

### Notification Design

A significant body of prior work has evaluated and improved warning messages and notifications, including browser warnings [1, 6, 8, 28], phishing warnings [15, 16, 46], malware warnings [3], and PDF download warnings [29]. Early work by Egelman et al. [15] found that phishing warnings were generally ineffective, with high click-through rates. They recommended clear action instructions, making warnings more distinguishable from less severe alerts, and implementing blocking, full-screen, active warnings. Extensive research on TLS warnings [6, 21, 52, 53] showed that opinionated design can improve adherence. Egelman et al. [16] demonstrated how small design changes can increase the time users spend looking at notifications. Reeder et al. [50] conducted a survey on browser warnings in situ with Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox users, concluding that future improvements should focus on smaller, contextual misunderstandings. These real-world improvements underscore the importance of designing effective notifications. Our notifications aim to correct misconceptions and encourage the adoption of WebAuthn.

### Participatory Design and Focus Groups

Warning designers often apply heuristics or expert views during the development and improvement process [21, 46, 56]. For the design of our notifications, we use focus groups and a participatory design (PD) approach. PD involves prospective users in the development and design process, providing valuable insights that challenge experts' assumptions. Weber et al. [60] applied PD to develop new TLS warning messages, describing it as "suitable and versatile" for security interface design. Their participants preferred short, actionable, and concrete warnings. Redmiles et al. [49] studied notifications aimed at encouraging 2FA adoption and found that personalized headlines, bullet points, and the color blue can increase adoption. Contrary to prior work, their participants preferred to avoid graphics, finding them less professional. Gorski et al. [25] used PD to improve security-related console warnings for developers, highlighting that design recommendations for end users may not align with experts' preferences. Althobaiti et al. [4] worked with focus groups to improve the usability of phishing reports. McNally et al. [35] applied PD with children to enhance mobile child protective apps. Chouhan et al. [10] used PD to design a smartphone app for collaborative decision-making on privacy and security. Krombholz et al. [30] used a drawing task to elicit mental models of HTTPS, a technique we also employ.

### Study 1: Online Study of Misconceptions

The goal of this study was to understand potential misconceptions users might have about using biometric WebAuthn. In this two-part study, participants registered and authenticated at a website we created, ExampleTech, using their personal mobile devices. Our implementation is based on Spomky-Labs' PHP WebAuthn Framework [38], with modifications to allow only platform authenticators, require user verification, and set a 60-second timeout. Our code is available on GitHub.1 Note that we used the same WebAuthn implementation for Study 3 (Section 5).

#### Method

Figure 2a illustrates the overall study flow. Participants were recruited via Proliﬁc for a study with two parts: registration and authentication, conducted one week apart. Eligibility criteria included being 18+ years old, residing in the US or UK, having a 95%+ approval rating, and owning an Android phone (running Android 7+) with Google Chrome and biometric phone unlocking configured and enabled. All study protocols were approved by the University of Chicago Institutional Review Board (IRB). Participants were paid $5 for each phase of the study.

**Registration Phase**: Participants first created an account on the ExampleTech website. The main goal was to establish a baseline for misconceptions and opinions about WebAuthn. We crafted an intentionally vague baseline notification stating, “Depending on your device, you can sign in with your fingerprint, face, or iris.” After showing this notification, we simulated a sign-up page by asking participants to provide their age and gender. Upon pressing “register,” the WebAuthn protocol began, launching an OS-specific WebAuthn instruction screen. Participants locally authenticated on their phone (e.g., with their fingerprint or a fallback mechanism like a PIN). If successful, their account was created, and they were redirected to complete the registration survey. If they failed, they completed an alternate survey to understand the reason for the failure.

The registration survey included questions about participants' use of biometrics, their System Usability Scale (SUS) ratings for WebAuthn, and their mental models of WebAuthn and passwords. We hypothesized that misconceptions about where biometrics are stored and with whom they are shared might heavily influence opinions about WebAuthn. The survey also solicited multiple-choice responses and free-text justifications related to additional potential misconceptions surrounding security and usability. We developed these questions through iterative piloting to investigate relevant misconceptions observed in prior user studies about biometric authentication outside the WebAuthn context (cf. Section 2.3). The survey concluded with demographic questions.

**Piloting**: We developed our questions based on previously documented misconceptions about biometrics, WebAuthn, and 2FA, focusing on those relevant in the biometric WebAuthn context (cf. Section 2). To minimize biased, confusing, or technical wording, we conducted formal think-aloud cognitive pilot interviews with three domain experts and four non-technical participants. Based on their feedback, we iteratively refined the survey wording and flow.

**Authentication Phase**: The authentication phase followed a similar procedure. Participants were asked to sign into the ExampleTech website with the account they had created. Those unable to create an account in the previous week were not invited to complete this follow-up session. The one-week waiting period was intended to minimize the effect of account creation on the login process. Typically, users log in more frequently than they create accounts, so it was important to explore both separately.

Once signed in, participants answered questions about possible misconceptions with the login. If they failed to log in, they were given two more attempts before being redirected to an alternate survey. The authentication-phase survey asked more direct questions about their opinions regarding the use of biometric WebAuthn. These questions were placed at the end of the phase to avoid priming participants.

We provided a help page with a note that they needed to use the same device as they used for account registration. If participants tried to use a different device or browser, they were automatically redirected to this help page, where they could exit the study early with partial compensation.

#### Participants

We recruited 50 participants, 42 of whom registered successfully. 41 registered with their fingerprint, and one with their face.
