I have installed Matplotlib on macOS using a Gentoo prefix. Everything appears to be working correctly, except for one issue: when I attempt to save a file, I am unable to change the filename in the dialog box. This is because any keyboard input is directed to the terminal where I am running Python, rather than to the dialog box. I am unsure whether this problem is specific to Matplotlib or if it stems from tkinter within Python. However, I have only encountered this issue while using Matplotlib.
