### Addressing the Challenges

We address these challenges through a two-step process. First, we isolate the computational aspects by employing a special treatment of ciphertexts. Second, we introduce a novel bisimulation technique that incorporates static information-flow analysis, followed by the necessary cryptographic reductions. The rigorous proof spans 30 pages [10], so we will provide a brief overview here. For more details, refer to Figure 4.

### Introducing Encryption Machines

We utilize two encryption machines, EncH and Encsim,H, from [49] to manage the encryption and decryption needs of the system. EncH correctly encrypts every message \( m \), while Encsim,H always encrypts a fixed message \( 1 \) and responds to decryption requests for the resulting ciphertexts via table look-up. According to [49], EncH is at least as secure as Encsim,H.

- **Step 1**: We modify the machines \( M_u \) to use EncH, yielding modified machines \( M'_u \).
- **Step 2**: We replace EncH with its idealized counterpart Encsim,H and use the composition theorem to show that the original system is at least as secure as the resulting system.

### Combined System

Next, we aim to compare the combination \( M_H \) of the modified machines \( M'_u \) and Encsim,H with the combination \( T_{HSimH} \) of the machines \( T_H(H) \) and SimH. Since there is no direct invariant mapping between the states of these two joint machines, we define an intermediate system \( C_H \) with a state space combined from both systems (Step 3 in Figure 4).

### Bisimulations with Error Sets and Information-Flow Analysis

We demonstrate that the joint view of H and A is equivalent in interaction with the combined machine \( C_H \) and the two machines \( T_{HSimH} \) and \( M_H \), except for certain runs, which we collect in error sets. This is achieved by performing two bisimulations simultaneously (Step 4 in Figure 4). Transitivity and symmetry of indistinguishability then yield the desired result for \( T_{HSimH} \) and \( M_H \). In addition to several normal state invariants of \( C_H \), we also define and prove an information-flow invariant on the variables of \( C_H \).

### Reduction Proofs

We show that the aggregated probability of the runs in error sets is negligible, as otherwise, we could break the underlying cryptography. This involves reduction proofs against the security definitions of the primitives. For signature forgeries and collisions of nonces or ciphertexts, these are relatively straightforward. For the adversary's inability to guess "official" nonces and additional randomizers in signatures and ciphertexts, we use the information-flow invariant on the variables of \( C_H \) to show that the adversary has no partial information about such values in situations where correct guessing would place the run in an error set. This proves that \( M_H \) is computationally at least as secure as the ideal system (Step 5 in Figure 4).

### Final Step: Simulatability

Finally, since simulatability is transitive [49], the original real system is also as secure as the ideal system (Step 6 in Figure 4).
