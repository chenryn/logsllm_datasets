### Optimized Text

#### Comparison with [18]
Our proposed scheme outperforms the solution in [18] when the size of the Boolean formula exceeds the number of clauses. In such cases, our scheme is more efficient. Otherwise, both schemes exhibit the same level of efficiency. Our construction also achieves faster decryption times, which is a significant improvement over [18], one of the best constructions for Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) that supports fine-grained policies.

Additionally, our scheme can be extended to allow users to keep only part of the encryption and decryption material secret. This feature is particularly useful for users with limited storage and computational capabilities or those leveraging cloud services. Furthermore, we have introduced support for multiple non-colluding authorities, effectively mitigating the key-escrow problem associated with a single authority.

#### Appendix

##### A. Multi-Authority CP-ABE
Formally, a multi-authority CP-ABE scheme consists of four probabilistic algorithms:

1. **Setup(1λ, B, θ)**: The setup algorithm takes the security parameter λ, the description of the attributes' universe B, and the maximum number of authorities in the system θ as inputs. It generates θ partial master keys MSK1, ..., MSKθ, as well as the global public parameters param of the system.

2. **Extract(u, B(u), MSKi, param)**: This algorithm takes as input a user u and his set of attributes B(u), along with the public parameters param and a partial master key MSKi (1 ≤ i ≤ θ). It outputs the partial user’s private key di_u. This algorithm is run θ times by θ different authorities. Finally, the full secret key of the user is computed from the θ partial user’s private keys.

3. **Encrypt(M, A, param)**: This algorithm takes as input a message M, an access policy A over the universe of attributes, and the global public parameters param. It outputs the ciphertext ct along with a description of the access policy A.

4. **Decrypt(ct, du, param)**: This algorithm takes as input the ciphertext ct, the private key du of user u, and the global public parameters param. It outputs the message M if and only if B(u) satisfies A. Otherwise, it outputs ⊥.

**Security Model:**
We consider two types of adversaries for a multi-authority CP-ABE scheme, named Type I adversary A1 (related to Game I below) and Type II adversary A2 (related to Game II below).

- **Type I Adversary (A1)**: This represents a third-party adversary against the multi-authority CP-ABE scheme. A1 does not know any partial master secret key.
- **Type II Adversary (A2)**: This represents a curious authority who generates partial secret keys for users. Besides knowing other information as A1 does, A2 also knows at most θ − 1 partial master secret keys.

A multi-authority CP-ABE scheme is considered secure if it resists Type II adversaries.

**Game I**: This game is almost the same as the definition of the security model in Section 2.1.

**Game II**: This game is also similar to the definition of the security model in Section 2.1, except that the simulator must provide at most θ − 1 partial master keys for the adversary.

##### B. Conversion from a Boolean Formula to a Corresponding LSSS Matrix
In this section, we recall from [20] the algorithm to convert a Boolean formula into a corresponding LSSS matrix. The algorithm works as follows:

1. **Convert the Boolean Formula to an Access Tree**: Consider the Boolean formula as an access tree, where interior nodes are AND and OR gates, and leaf nodes correspond to attributes. Use (1, 0, ..., 0) as the sharing vector for the LSSS matrix. Begin by labeling the root node of the tree with the vector (1) (a vector of length 1).

2. **Labeling the Nodes**: Go down the levels of the tree, labeling each node with a vector determined by the vector assigned to its parent node. Maintain a global counter variable c, initialized to 1.
   - If the parent node is an OR gate labeled by the vector v, label its children by v (and the value of c stays the same).
   - If the parent node is an AND gate labeled by the vector v, pad v with 0's at the end (if necessary) to make it of length c. Label one of its children with the vector v|1 (where | denotes concatenation) and the other with the vector (0, ..., 0)| -1, where (0, ..., 0) denotes the zero vector of length c. Note that these two vectors sum to v|0. Increment the value of c by 1.

3. **Finalize the LSSS Matrix**: Once the entire tree is labeled, the vectors labeling the leaf nodes form the rows of the LSSS matrix. If these vectors have different lengths, pad the shorter ones with 0's at the end to arrive at vectors of the same length.
