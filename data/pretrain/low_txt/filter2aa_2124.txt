### Background
**What is Urban Exploration?**

Urban Exploration, or UrbEx, is the practice of discovering, exploring, and often photographing the more unconventional and overlooked areas of human civilization. As Jeff Chapman, also known as "Ninjalicious," described in 2004, "This hobby consists of a lot more than just poking about in abandoned buildings and storm drains and hanging out on web boards trying to impress people. Being an urban explorer is a whole way of looking at the world, where every ladder, door, window, grate, and hole in the ground is a possible portal to adventure."

**What do we explore?**
- **Civil Buildings:** Hospitals, schools, institutions
- **Industrial Buildings:** Factories, transportation facilities
- **Utilities & Infrastructure:** Steam tunnels, storm drains, utility corridors
- **Residential Areas:** Hotels, high-rises, houses, and shanties

**The UrbEx Subculture**
- **Jeff Chapman ("Ninjalicious")** coined the term "Urban Exploration" and operated the zine "Infiltration" from 1996 to 2005.
- Several online communities have emerged over the past decade, such as UER.CA (mostly USA), DegGi5.com (NE USA), and 28dayslater.co.uk (UK).

**Explorers vs. Tourists vs. Scenesters**
- **Birds of a Feather: What Urban Explorers and Computer Hackers Have in Common**
  - **Perspective:** Both share a "behind-the-scenes" view of the world and the ability to look at things abstractly.
  - **Willingness to Use Non-Standard Entry Points:** They are willing to use unconventional methods to gain access.
  - **Secrecy:** Both are built around subcultures with counterculture tendencies, often distrusting newbies and hesitant to allow outsiders in.
  - **Script Kiddies and Tourists:** These are individuals who engage in the activity without the depth of knowledge or respect for the community.

**Gray Area Activities**
- The line between using one's skills for good and for personal satisfaction can be blurred.
- There is often a sense of "moral superiority" while engaging in legally questionable behavior.

**Social Engineering**
- Social engineering is incredibly effective in both UrbEx and hacking, but the stakes are higher (e.g., potential legal consequences).
- **Exploitation by Others:**
  - **Taggers vs. Website Defacers**
  - **Scrappers vs. Phishers**
  - **Drug Labs, Gangs, and K1dd1e-pr0n Collectors**

### Safety
**This is a hobby. We do it for fun. Dying is not fun.**

**Hazards:**
- **Off-limits areas** may not meet safety codes.
- **Abandoned buildings** may not be structurally sound.
- **Hazardous materials** and **hazardous people** may be present.
- In the basement of an abandoned building, no one can hear you scream.

**Safety: Rules to Live By**
- **Do List:**
  - Tell someone exactly where you are going and check in later.
  - Carry a cellphone.
  - Bring multiple flashlights.
  - Be wary of water-damaged floors.
  - Move slowly; look, then move.
  - Wear well-fitting, protective clothing.
  - Wear waterproof, sturdy shoes or boots.
  - Consider using gloves, masks, or other safety equipment.

- **Don't List:**
  - Never explore alone.
  - Do not step, crawl, or move where you can't see.
  - Do not put any body part through jagged metal or broken glass.
  - Do not climb anything unstable.
  - Do not move while looking through a camera.
  - Do not let doors close behind you without checking their openability from both sides.
  - Do not touch, taste, or smell unusual substances.

**Health Hazards:**
- **Asbestos:** No known "safe level" of exposure. Mesothelioma can develop more than 10 years later.
- **Asphyxiation:** Enclosed and subterranean spaces can have poor air quality.
- **Disease Exposure:** Pigeon, rat, and animal waste, as well as human waste, can pose risks. Tetanus, Hepatitis A & B are preventable with vaccines.
- **Chemical Exposure:** PCBs, acids, and toxic waste may be present in industrial locations. Research the facility before entering and wear appropriate protective gear.

**Legality:**
- Trespass laws vary by state. Look up your local laws.
- Getting permission is always a good idea.
- Avoid theft, vandalism, breaking and entering, and possession of burglary tools.
- Disregarding these rules not only puts you at risk but also makes life harder for legitimate explorers.

**Disclaimer:** I am not a lawyer, and nothing in this presentation is intended to be legal advice. If in doubt, consult an attorney.

**No Lock Picks!**
- **Stealth and Appearance:**
  - Dress to look convincing, not cool.
  - Walk and act "casual, but confident."
  - Use credibility props, as coined by Ninjalicious.
  - Be aware of your visibility and act accordingly.

**Parking and Confrontations:**
- Introduce yourself first.
- Be friendly and non-confrontational.
- Offer to leave peacefully.

**Do No Harm:**
- Follow the Sierra Club motto: "Take nothing but photographs, leave nothing but footprints."
- Vandalism or breaking and entering increases the likelihood of criminal charges.
- Creating new or obvious points of entry invites graffiti, theft, and squatters.
- Be respectful of property owners and future explorers by not changing anything.

**Life-cycle of an Abandonment:**
- **Secured:** Boarded-up windows, chained doors, locked fences.
- **Infiltrated:** Break-in by scrappers, taggers, homeless, etc. At least one point of entry (PoE) exists, possibly concealed.
- **Promiscuous:** Accessibility is well established, with multiple PoEs. Regular occupancy by taggers, homeless, teenagers, and explorers. Rapid deterioration of the site (graffiti, trash, theft, etc.).
- **Incident:** Injury, death, murder, or arrest on-site. Police involvement, property owner contacted, cycle repeats.

**Discovering Locations:**
- **Open Your Eyes:**
  - Check likely areas of town for the types of facilities you are interested in.
  - Look for railroad tracks, industrial areas, downtown areas, and commercial property listings.
- **Using the Internet:**
  - Google Earth, satellite, and street views.
  - Web searches (do this last).
  - Do not ask explorers online for specific locations, akin to asking for a 0-day exploit in a hacker forum.
