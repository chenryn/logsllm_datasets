### Novel Policy Designs for Gesture Passwords: Blacklist, Consolidated, and Lexical

We propose three novel policy designs for gesture passwords: blacklist, consolidated, and lexical. These policies were evaluated in a two-day study involving 4,000 participants. The results indicate that while the lexical policy reduces security against online attacks with 20 guesses, the blacklist and consolidated policies significantly increase guessing entropy and reduce susceptibility to dictionary attacks, albeit with a modest impact on usability.

Gesture passwords are a promising technology for smartphone authentication. Future research should focus on understanding the gestures people create and the policies, guidance, and feedback needed to enhance their security. This paper contributes to this goal by providing insights into the effectiveness of different policy designs.

### Appendix A: Subjective Categorization of Gestures

Table X reports subjective categorization rates for gestures. The first seven categories appear in prior work [11], while the remaining four categories—Compound, Cursive, Iconic, and Other—were newly introduced. Compound gestures are complex, involving at least two or more elements (e.g., a shape and a letter); cursive gestures involve short sequences of letters (e.g., handwriting); iconic gestures depict objects (e.g., hands and flowers). The "Other" category collects any remaining gestures.

The first study and second study baseline and lexical categorizations are broadly consistent. The second study's blacklist and consolidated policies show reductions in gestures categorized as geometric shapes and letters and elevated rates for compound categorizations. Compared to prior work (right column), gesture categorizations show reduced rates for geometric shapes and letters due to the introduction of new categories (particularly compound) and a reduced occurrence of math and music symbols, possibly due to different populations (university students in [11] versus MTurk workers here).

### Appendix B: Distribution of Gesture Points in Policy Conditions in First and Second Studies

Figure 9 depicts the distribution of gesture points in both studies. All results show bias in start and final point locations; first study data and the second study baseline policy are most strongly biased (to left corners) in start position, and the lexical policy is most evenly distributed in start and final positions.

### Appendix C: n-gram Model Results

Table XI presents details of the 134 n-gram models generated from gestures captured in the first study that achieved a crack rate of greater than 10%. These data highlight the challenges in selecting appropriate n-gram models, as high crack rates can be combined with low similarity to the original user-chosen gestures. Similarly, high similarity scores can be obtained with larger models (i.e., with more fine-grained discretizations), while the number of n-gram cases observed can be reduced.
