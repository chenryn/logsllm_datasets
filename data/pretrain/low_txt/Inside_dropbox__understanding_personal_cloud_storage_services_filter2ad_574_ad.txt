### 5. SERVICE WORKLOAD

#### 5.1 Storage Volume
In this section, we correlate ISP customers (IP addresses) in home networks with the total storage volume in retrieve and store operations. The amount of data retrieved and stored per household is depicted in Figure 11. Each IP address is represented by a point, and different symbols are used to illustrate the number of devices behind the IP address. Note that cases with less than 1 kB are placed on the axes due to the logarithmic scales. The figure accounts only for transfers made from the Dropbox client. Similar to Section 4.4, the typical overhead of SSL negotiations was subtracted from the transferred amount.

**Figure 11: Data volume stored and retrieved from Dropbox in each household.**

- **Data Volume Units:**
  - 100M, 10M, 1M, 100k, 10k, 1k, 100G, 10G, 1G
  - Retrieve (bytes)

- **Subfigure (b) Home 2**

**Observations:**
- Dropbox users tend to download more than upload, as seen in the density of points below the diagonals.
- In Campus 2, the total downloaded data is 2.4 times higher than the total uploaded data.
- This ratio is 1.6 and 1.4 in Campus 1 and Home 1, respectively.
- Home 2 is an exception, with a ratio of around 0.9, indicating some customers are heavily uploading content, which can be seen in the top right corner of Figure 11(b).
- One of these customers is also responsible for the bias in the CDF depicted in Figure 7.

**Usage Scenarios:**
- **Occasional Users:** These users abandon their Dropbox clients and hardly synchronize any content (points close to the origins).
- **Upload-Only Users:** These users mainly submit files (points close to the y-axes).
- **Download-Only Users:** These users execute predominantly retrieve operations (points close to the x-axes).
- **Heavy Users:** These users both store and retrieve large amounts of data (points along the diagonals).

**Table 5: Summary of User Groups in Home 1 and Home 2**

| Group         | IP Addresses (%) | Sessions (%) | Retrieved Data (GB) | Stored Data (GB) | Days Online (avg.) | Devices (avg.) |
|---------------|------------------|--------------|---------------------|------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| Occasional    | 31%              | 15%          | 16.37               | 1.22             | 1.13               | 1.0            |
| Upload-Only   | 6%               | 6%           | 84                  | 1.36             | 1.37               | 0.8            |
| Download-Only | 26%              | 24%          | 21.53               | 1.69             | 1.34               | 1.0            |
| Heavy         | 37%              | 54%          | 417                 | 2.65             | 2.16               | 2.0            |

- **Home 2:**
  - Occasional: 32%, 18%
  - Upload-Only: 7%, 4%
  - Download-Only: 28%, 23%
  - Heavy: 33%, 55%

**Key Findings:**
- The occasional group represents around 30% of the total IP addresses in both vantage points and exchanges a negligible amount of data.
- The upload-only group accounts for around 7% of the IP addresses and is responsible for a significant amount of uploads (21% in Home 1 and 11% in Home 2).
- The download-only group is very significant in both the number of IP addresses (26% in Home 1 and 28% in Home 2) and transferred volume (25% and 28%, respectively).
- The heavy group, accounting for 37% of IP addresses in Home 1 and 33% in Home 2, is responsible for most of the volume transferred by Dropbox clients.

#### 5.2 Devices
This section describes the distribution of the number of devices residing in the same LAN. Devices connected to the same LAN can use the LAN Sync Protocol for synchronizing files without retrieving duplicated content from the cloud.

**Figure 12: Distribution of the number of devices per household using the Dropbox client.**

- **Key Observations:**
  - Around 60% of households have only one device linked to the service.
  - Most of the remaining households have up to 4 devices and are part of the heavy group.
  - In Home 1, around 60% of households with more than one device (around 25% of the total) share at least one folder among the devices, confirming the typical use of Dropbox for device synchronization.
  - No more than 25% of households are benefiting from the LAN Sync Protocol, and the remaining users rely on central storage data centers for their data transfers.

#### 5.3 Shared Folders
To measure the extent to which Dropbox is being used for content sharing or collaborative work, we analyze namespace identifications in Home 1 and Campus 1 traffic.

**Figure 13: Number of namespaces per device.**

- **Key Observations:**
  - The number of namespaces per device is not stationary and has a slightly increasing trend.
  - In both networks, the number of users with only one namespace (the users' root folder) is small: 13% in Campus 1 and 28% in Home 1.
  - Users in Campus 1 have more namespaces than in Home 1, with 50% of users having 5 or more namespaces in Campus 1 compared to 23% in Home 1.
  - Workstations in Campus 1 have an average of 3.86 namespaces per device.

#### 5.4 Daily Usage
We characterize whether the use of the Dropbox client has any typical seasonality.

**Figure 14: Distinct device start-ups per day â€“ fraction of the number of devices in each probe.**

- **Key Observations:**
  - Around 40% of all devices start at least one session every day in home networks, including weekends.
  - In campus networks, there is a strong weekly seasonality.
  - At a finer time scale (1-hour bins), the service usage follows a clear day-night pattern.

**Figure 15: Daily usage of Dropbox on weekdays.**

- **Subfigures:**
  - **(a) Session Start-Ups:** Fraction of distinct devices starting a session in each interval.
  - **(b) Active Devices:** Fraction of devices active (connected to Dropbox) per time interval.
  - **(c) Retrieve:** Fraction of the total number of bytes exchanged in each time interval in retrieve functions.
  - **(d) Store:** Fraction of the total number of bytes exchanged in each time interval in store functions.

**Key Observations:**
- Dropbox usage varies strongly in different locations, following the presence of users in the environment.
- In Campus 1, session start-ups have a clear relation with employees' office hours.
- In home networks, peaks of start-ups are seen early in the morning and during the evenings.
- All time series of active devices (Figure 15(b)) are smooth, showing that the number of active users at any time of the day is easily predictable.

#### 5.5 Session Duration
We analyze the session duration based on the TCP flows to notification servers.

**Figure 16: Distribution of session durations.**

- **Key Observations:**
  - Home 1, Home 2, and Campus 2 have similar behavior in general, with an exception for the number of short-lived sessions.
  - In both home networks, a significant number of notification flows are terminated in less than 1 minute.
  - A closer inspection reveals that most of those flows are from a few devices, suggesting that network equipment (e.g., NAT or firewalls) might be terminating notification connections abruptly.
