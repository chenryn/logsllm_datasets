### S/MIME and PGP Usage Analysis at Our University

#### Key Insights
- **RSA** is the most widely used key algorithm.
- For **S/MIME**, a key size of 2048 bits was most commonly used.
- **PGP** keys predominantly used 4096 bits, although newer PGP keys have reverted to less secure 2048 bits.
- Approximately one-third of PGP keys did not have an expiration date set.
- The **Deutsche Telekom** was the root CA for 64.95% of all S/MIME certificates.

#### Client and Operating System Distribution

    - **Android**: 7,153
    - **Webmail**: 4,903
    - **Unknown**: 428
    - **No Useragent**: 6,825

**Notes:**
- AppleMail and the iOS mail client do not include the X-Mailer header in the sent folder, leading to their identification as "No Useragent."
- Not all clients store the operating system as part of the Useragent/X-Mailer field. If not available, they are identified as "Unknown."
