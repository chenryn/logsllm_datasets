- **Figure 8:** Top 20 ASes in normalized content delivery potential.

## 2. Factors Influencing Content Delivery Potential
### 2.1 Akamai Caches
- All these ASes host Akamai caches, which boost their content delivery potential.
- The widespread deployment of Akamai caches in carriers is a significant factor.

### 2.2 Exclusive Content
- Some ASes host unique content that is not available elsewhere.
- This exclusivity is more important than the presence of Akamai caches and explains why some ASes rank higher.

### 2.3 Normalized Ranking
- A ranking based on normalized content delivery potential spreads the weight of distributed content infrastructure across all ASes.
- The top ASes in the normalized ranking are those with exclusive content, as reflected by their CMI values.

## 3. Comparison with Other Rankings
### 3.1 Topology-Driven Rankings
- Many topology-driven rankings have been proposed, such as CAIDA's AS-degree and customer cone rankings, Renesys' ranking, and the Knodes Index.
- These rankings tend to favor large transit carriers.

### 3.2 Traffic-Driven Rankings
- Arbor's traffic exchange-based ranking is similar to topological rankings, except for Google and Comcast.
- Our content-based rankings give more weight to ASes that deliver a large amount of content.

### 3.3 Content-Based Rankings
- The normalized potential ranking leads to similar top-ranked ASes as topological and traffic-based rankings but favors ASes that host content.
- No single ranking captures all aspects of an AS's importance; a comprehensive understanding requires considering topology, traffic, and content.

## 4. Discussion
### 4.1 Dynamic Nature of Hosting Infrastructures
- Hosting infrastructures are dynamic, growing, changing peerings, and placing infrastructure inside ISP networks.
- Our methodology provides an automated tool to monitor the state of hosting infrastructures at a given time.

### 4.2 Commoditization and User-Generated Content
- Content producers have more choices for placing content, especially to target their user base.
- Meta-CDNs distribute content demand across different CDNs, requiring content producers to measure server diversity and performance.

### 4.3 Competition and Collaboration
- Competition among CDNs is intense, with ISPs deploying more hosting infrastructures.
- The IETF's Content Delivery Networks Interconnect (CDNi) working group aims to standardize interconnection between CDNs.

### 4.4 Virtualization
- Virtualization offers flexibility for content producers, providers, and ISPs to dynamically move content.
- It will lead to a richer market, better resource utilization, and improved service to end-users.
- Virtualization poses both challenges and opportunities for Web content cartography.

## 5. Related Work
### 5.1 Rise of Web Content Traffic
- Studies show a significant rise in Web content traffic, driven by video traffic and broadband penetration.
- Large-scale content distribution networks and data-centers are being deployed to handle this growth.

### 5.2 Consolidation and Shifts in Peerings
- Labovitz et al. observed consolidation of Web content traffic and shifts in peerings.
- Our approach focuses on hosting infrastructures, providing extensive coverage of popular hosting infrastructures.

### 5.3 Co-location and DNS Requests
- Shue et al. observed co-location of servers in .com and .net domains.
- Huang et al., Su et al., and Triukose et al. used DNS requests to understand Web content distribution.

### 5.4 Clustering and End-User Grouping
- Clustering has been used to group end-users based on routing and DNS resolution.
- Our approach focuses on identifying and clustering hosting infrastructures rather than end-users.

## 6. Conclusion
- We introduce Web content cartography, a lightweight and fully automated approach to discover Web content hosting and delivery infrastructures.
- Our results show that a significant fraction of content is exclusively delivered by specific hosting infrastructures or geographical regions.
- Content-centric AS rankings complement existing AS rankings and provide insights into recent observations about shifts in the AS topology.
- Our work is crucial for content producers, providers, ISPs, and the research community, enabling better peering decisions, network dimensioning, and competitiveness in the content delivery market.
