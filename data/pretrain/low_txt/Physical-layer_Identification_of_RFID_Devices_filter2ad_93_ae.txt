### Experiments and Analysis

In our experiments, the remote feature extraction process resulted in an Equal Error Rate (EER) of approximately 50%. We hypothesize that this high EER is due to changes in the acquisition antenna orientation and a lower signal-to-noise ratio. While it is possible that other discriminant features could be found for remote extraction, this does not appear to be the case with our current set of features.

After obtaining the original fingerprint, an attacker would need to produce or find an RFID transponder with the same fingerprint, which is challenging given that the extracted fingerprints are a result of manufacturing process variations. Although these variations affect the RFID micro-controller, it is likely that the main source of detectable variation lies in the RFID radio circuitry. However, we cannot conclusively determine which component of the entire transponder circuit contributes most to the fingerprints. This determination is left for future work. Given the complexity of these circuits, this task is challenging even in a controlled laboratory setting, let alone in the uncontrolled environment of an attacker.

### Use Case: On-Transponder Fingerprint Storage

In the second use case, transponder fingerprints are measured before deployment, as in the first case, but are stored on the transponders rather than in a back-end database. We assume that the fingerprints stored on the transponders are digitally signed by the document-issuing authority and protected from unauthorized remote access. The digital signature binds the fingerprint to the document's unique identifier, both of which are stored on the transponder. During document authenticity validation, the binding between the document ID and the stored fingerprint is ensured through cryptographic verification of the authority’s signature. If the signature is valid, the stored fingerprint is compared to the measured fingerprint of the document transponder.

The main advantage of this approach is that document authenticity can be verified offline. The main drawback is that the fingerprint is now stored on the transponder, and without appropriate access protection, it can be remotely obtained by an attacker. Minimal access protection can be provided, for example, through Basic Access Authentication [3], although this mechanism has known weaknesses due to predictable document numbers [33].

As mentioned in Section 5.4, our technique generates compact fingerprints that can be stored in approximately 120 bytes, making them suitable for storage in today’s e-passports. The ICAO standard [3] provides space for such storage in files EF.DG[3-14], which are reserved for additional biometric and future use. Our proposal does not require the storage of a new public key or the maintenance of a separate public-key infrastructure, as the integrity of the fingerprints stored in EF.DG[3-14] will be protected by the existing passive authentication mechanisms implemented in current e-passports.

### Related Work: Transponder Cloning Protection

The closest work to ours in terms of transponder cloning protection is the research by Devadas et al. [12], where the authors propose and implement Physically Unclonable Function (PUF)-Based RFID transponders. These transponders contain special circuits, PUFs, that are difficult to clone, thus preventing transponder cloning. The main difference between PUF-based solutions and our techniques is that our methods can be used with existing RFID transponders, whereas PUF-based solutions can only detect cloning of PUF-based transponders. However, PUF-based solutions have the advantage of relying on "controlled" randomness, unlike our techniques, which rely on the unintentional randomness introduced during the manufacturing of RFID tags.

### Related Work: Signal Similarities and Features

Several other works relate to our research. Richter et al. [41] report on the possibility of detecting the country that issued a given passport by analyzing the bytes sent in response to carefully chosen commands from the reader. This technique enables classification of RFID transponders used in e-passports but cannot be used for cloning detection, as the attacker can modify the tag responses at the logical level.

The proliferation of radio technologies has led to various research initiatives aimed at detecting illegally operated radio transmitters [44, 45, 23], mobile phone cloning [30], defective transmission devices [48], and identifying wireless devices [20, 22, 43, 40, 39, 9] using physical characteristics of the transmitted signals [15]. Below, we present the most relevant work in terms of signal similarities, features, and objectives.

- **Hall et al.** [20, 21] explored a combination of features such as amplitude, phase, in-phase, quadrature, power, and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) of the transient signal. They tested on 30 IEEE 802.11b transceivers from 6 different manufacturers and achieved a classification error rate of 5.5%. Further work on 10 Bluetooth transceivers from 3 manufacturers recorded a classification error rate of 7% [22].
- **Ureten et al.** [39] extracted the envelope of the instantaneous amplitude using the Hilbert transformation and classified the signals using a Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN). Their method was tested on 8 IEEE 802.11b transceivers from 8 different manufacturers and registered a classification error rate of 2%-4%.
- **Rasmussen et al.** [40] explored transient length, amplitude variance, number of peaks of the carrier signal, and the difference between mean and maximum value of the transient. The features were tested on 10 identical Mica2 (CC1000) sensor devices (approximately 15 cm from the capturing antenna) and achieved a classification error rate of 30%.
- **Brik et al.** [9] proposed a device identification technique based on the variance of modulation errors. The method was tested on 100 identical 802.11b NICs (3-15 m from the capturing antenna) and achieved a classification error rate of 3% and 0.34% for k-NN and SVM classifiers, respectively.
- **Danev and Čapkun** [11] demonstrated the feasibility of transient-based Tmote Sky (CC2420) sensor device identification with an EER of 0.24%. They also considered the stability of the proposed fingerprint features with respect to capturing distance, antenna polarization, and voltage, and related attacks on the identification system.

### Conclusion

In this work, we conducted the first comprehensive study of physical-layer identification of RFID transponders. We showed that RFID transponders have stable fingerprints related to physical-layer properties, enabling their accurate identification. Our techniques are based on the extraction of the modulation shape and spectral features of the response signals of the transponders to in- and out-of-specification reader signals. We tested our techniques on a set of 50 RFID smart cards of the same manufacturer and type, achieving an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 2.43% (single run) and 4.38% (two runs). We further applied our techniques to a smaller set of electronic passports, obtaining similar identification accuracy. We also tested the classification accuracy of our techniques, showing that they achieve 0% average classification error for classes corresponding to manufacturers and countries of issuance. Finally, we analyzed possible applications of the proposed techniques to the detection of cloned products and documents.
