## Abstract
On November 3, 2009, voters in Takoma Park, Maryland, cast ballots for the mayor and city council members using the Scantegrity II voting system—the first time any end-to-end (E2E) voting system with ballot privacy has been used in a binding governmental election. This case study describes the various efforts that went into the election, including the improved design and implementation of the voting system, streamlined procedures, agreements with the city, and assessments of the experiences of voters and poll workers.

The election, involving 1,728 voters from six wards, utilized paper ballots with invisible-ink confirmation codes, instant-runoff voting with write-ins, early and absentee (mail-in) voting, dual-language ballots, provisional ballots, privacy sleeves, any-which-way scanning with parallel conventional desktop scanners, end-to-end verifiability based on optional web-based voter verification of votes cast, a full hand recount, thresholded authorities, three independent outside auditors, fully-disclosed software, and exit surveys for voters and poll workers. Despite some glitches, the use of Scantegrity II was a success, demonstrating that E2E cryptographic voting systems can be effectively used and accepted by the general public.

## 1. Introduction
The November 2009 municipal election in Takoma Park, Maryland, marked the first time that anyone could verify that the votes were counted correctly in a secret ballot election for public office without having to be present for the entire proceedings. This article is a case study of the Takoma Park election, describing the process from the time the Scantegrity Voting System Team (SVST) was approached by the Takoma Park Board of Elections in February 2008 to the last cryptographic election audit in December 2009. While the paper provides a simple summary of survey results, the focus is on the engineering process of bringing a new cryptographic approach to solve a complex practical problem involving technology, procedures, and laws.

With the Scantegrity II voting system, voters mark optical scan paper ballots with pens, filling the oval for the candidates of their choice. These ballots are handled as traditional ballots, permitting all the usual automated and manual counting, accounting, and recounting. Additionally, the voting system provides a layer of integrity protection through its use of invisible-ink confirmation codes. When voters mark ballot ovals using a decoder pen, confirmation codes printed in invisible ink are revealed. Interested voters can note down these codes to check them later on the election website. The codes are generated randomly for each race and each ballot, and hence do not reveal the corresponding vote. A final tally can be computed from the codes, and the system provides a public digital audit trail of the computation.

Election audits in Scantegrity II are not restricted to privileged individuals and can be performed by voters and other interested parties. Developers and election authorities are unable to significantly falsify an election outcome without an overwhelming probability of an audit failure [8]. The system also addresses false claims of impropriety in the recording and tally of the votes, which are readily revealed to be false.

All the software used in the election—for ballot authoring, printing, scanning, and tally—was published well in advance of the election as commented, buildable source code, which may be a first in its own right. Moreover, commercial off-the-shelf scanners were adapted to receive ballots in privacy sleeves from voters, making the overall system relatively inexpensive.

Despite several limitations of the implementation, we found that the amount of extra work needed by officials to use Scantegrity II while administering an election is acceptable given the promise of improved voter satisfaction and indisputability of the outcome. Indeed, discussions are ongoing with the Board of Elections of the city regarding continued use of the system in future elections.

Another observation from the election is that the election officials and voters surveyed seemed to appreciate the system. Since voters who do not wish to verify can simply proceed as usual, ignoring the codes revealed in the filled ovals, the system is least intrusive for these voters. Those voters who did check their codes, and even many who did not, seem to appreciate the opportunity.

This paper describes the entire process of adapting the Scantegrity II system to handle the Takoma Park election, including the agreement with the city, printing the special ballots with invisible-ink confirmation codes, actually running the election, and verifying that the election outcome was correct.

## 3. Related Work
Chaum was the first to propose the use of cryptography for the purpose of secure elections [5]. This was followed by almost two decades of work in improving security and privacy guarantees, most recently under the rubric of end-to-end (E2E) voting systems. These voting system proposals provide integrity (any attempt to change the tally can be caught with very high probability by audits which are not restricted to privileged individuals) and ballot secrecy.

The first of these proposals include protocols by Chaum [6] and Neff [19], which were implemented soon after (Chaum’s as Citizen-Verified Voting [16] and Neff’s by VoteHere). Several more proposals with prototypes followed: Prêt à Voter [10], Punchscan [21, 15], the proposal of Kutylowski and Zagórski [18] as Voting Ducks, and Simple Verifiable Voting [4] as Helios [2] and VoteBox [24].

Making end-to-end systems usable in real elections has proven to be challenging. We are aware of the following previous binding elections held using similar verification technology: the Punchscan elections for the graduate students’ union of the University of Ottawa (2007) and the Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (2007); the Rijnland Internet Election System (RIES) public elections in the Netherlands in 2004 and 2006; the Helios elections of the Recteur of Université Catholique de Louvain [3] (2009) and the Princeton undergraduate student government election (2009), as well as a student election using Prêt à Voter.

Only the RIES system has been used in a governmental election; however, it is meant for remote (absentee) voting and, consequently, does not offer strong ballot secrecy guarantees. For this reason, it has been recommended that the RIES system not be used for regular public elections [17, 20]. Helios is also a remote voting system, and offers stronger ballot secrecy guarantees over RIES. The Punchscan elections were the closest to this study, but they did not rise to the level of public elections. They did not have multiple ballot styles, the users of the system were not a broad cross-segment of the population as in Takoma Park, the system implementors were deeply involved in administering the elections, and no active auditors were established to audit the elections. To date, this study is the most comparable use case of E2E technology to that of a typical optical scan election.

The case study reported here is based on a series of systems successively developed, tested, and deployed by a team of researchers included among the present authors, originating with the Punchscan system. Although it used paper ballots, the Punchscan system did not allow manual recounts, a feature that the team recognized as needing to be designed into the next generation of systems. The result was Scantegrity [9], which retained hand-countable ballots and was tested in a number of small elections. With Scantegrity, however, it was too easy to trigger an audit that would require scrutiny of the physical ballots. The Scantegrity II system [7, 8], deployed in Takoma Park, was a further refinement to address this problem by allowing a public statistical test of whether voter complaints actually reflect a discrepancy or whether they are without basis. Note: in the rest of the paper, “Scantegrity” refers to the voting team or to the Scantegrity II voting system; which one is typically easily determined from context.

As part of the Scantegrity agreement with Takoma Park (see section 3), a "mock election" [26] was held in April 2009 to test and demonstrate the feasibility of the Scantegrity system during Takoma Park’s annual Arbor Day celebration. Volunteer voters voted for their favorite tree. A number of revisions and tweaks to the Scantegrity system were made as a result of the mock election, including: ballot revisions (no detachable chit, but instead a separate voter verification card), pen revisions (two-ended, with different sized tips), scanner station revisions (better voter flow, no monitor, two scanners), privacy sleeve (no lock, no clipboard, folding design, feeds directly into scanner), and confirmation codes (three decimal digits).

## 4. The Setting
For several reasons, the implementation of voting systems is a difficult task. Most voting system users—i.e., the voters—are untrained, and elections happen infrequently. Voter privacy requirements preclude the usual sorts of feedback and auditing methods common in other applications, such as banking. Additionally, government regulations and pre-existing norms in the conduct of elections are difficult to change. These issues can pose significant challenges when deploying new voting systems, and it is therefore useful to understand the setting in which the election took place.

### About Takoma Park
The city of Takoma Park is located in Montgomery County, Maryland, shares a city line with Washington, D.C., and is governed by a mayor and a six-member City Council. The city has about 17,000 residents and almost 11,000 registered voters [27, pg. 10]. A seven-member Board of Elections conducts local elections in collaboration with the City Clerk. In the past, the city has used hand counts and optical scan voting, as well as Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) systems for state elections.

The Montgomery County US Census Update Data of 2005 provides some demographic information about the city. Median household income in 2004 was $48,675. The percentage of households with computers was 87.4%, and about 32% of Takoma Park residents above the age of twenty-five had a graduate, professional, or doctoral degree. It is an ethnically diverse city: 45.8% of its residents identify their race as "White," 36.3% as "Black," 9.7% as "Asian or Pacific Islander," and 8.2% as "Other" (individuals of Hispanic origin form the major component of this category). Further, 44.4% of its households have a foreign-born head of household or spouse, and 44.8% of residents above the age of five spoke a language other than English at home.

### Instant Runoff Voting (IRV)
Takoma Park has used IRV in municipal city elections since 2006. IRV is a ranked-choice system where each voter assigns each candidate a rank according to her preferences. The rules [3] used by Takoma Park (and the Scantegrity software) for counting IRV ballots are relatively standard, so we omit further discussion for lack of space.

### Agreement with the City
As with any municipal government in the US, Takoma Park is allowed to choose its own voting system for city elections. For county, state, and federal elections, it is constrained by county, state, and federal election laws.

Takoma Park and the SVST signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), in which the SVST agreed to provide equipment, software, training assistance, and technical support. The City of Takoma Park agreed to provide election-related information on the municipality, election workers, consumable materials, and perform or provide all other election duties or materials not provided by us. No goods or funds were exchanged.

According to the MOU, if approved by the city council, the election was to be conducted in compliance with all applicable laws and policies of the city. This included using Instant Runoff Voting as defined by the City of Takoma Park Municipal Charter.

The SVST also agreed to pursue an accessible ballot-marking device for the election, but was later relieved of satisfying this requirement. Unfortunately, Scantegrity is not yet fitted with a voter interface for those with visual or motor disabilities, and accessible user interfaces were also not used in Takoma Park’s previous optical scan elections.

### Timeline
Scantegrity was approached by the Takoma Park Board of Elections in February 2008. After initial discussions, a mock election was held in April 2009 to test and demonstrate the feasibility of the Scantegrity system. Following the mock election, several revisions and improvements were made to the system. The actual election was conducted on November 3, 2009, and the final cryptographic audit was completed in December 2009.
