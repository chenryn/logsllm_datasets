### Audience and Content Privacy Settings

When participants were asked about their reasons for changing the audience settings of a given post, they predominantly cited content-related factors (e.g., "It's irrelevant because it’s an old sports post about a game") rather than friendship dynamics or life events. Our qualitative analysis of participants' self-reported reasoning suggests that the content of a post is a critical factor in determining whether its privacy settings should be adjusted. We combined this insight with two key reasons for our prediction inaccuracies—namely, the presence of external content and limited text content—to propose that future work focusing on deeper post content analysis is likely to improve prediction accuracy. Additionally, our qualitative results indicated that privacy decisions were sometimes influenced by participants’ anticipation of their friends’ interests, which contributed to prediction inaccuracies.

### Data Privacy and Future Work

To protect participants’ privacy, our analysis was restricted to data from their Facebook accounts. Future research could include external data, provided it is collected with proper consent, which may further aid in identifying past posts that require retrospective privacy management. Therefore, future work should focus on utilizing additional data mined from connected URLs, as well as conducting more in-depth analyses of images and videos. Our detailed investigation into post privacy decisions provided valuable insights that refined our understanding of how to operationalize retrospective tools. This approach serves as a natural precursor to a broader, quantitative study of the same task.

### Limitations and Future Directions

As with most studies involving real user data, our study has several limitations. Due to our focus on deeply probing multiple posts for individual participants, our overall sample size is smaller than what would be ideal for quantitative analysis. Furthermore, allowing our tools to access the full contents of participants’ Facebook accounts likely introduced a nontrivial bias, potentially dissuading privacy-sensitive users from participating in this or similar studies requiring informed consent.

Our experimental approach, while not suitable for large-scale analysis, yielded promising prediction results. These results are likely a lower bound that will improve with access to more training data. Leveraging qualitative insights, Table 5 highlights additional features to collect in future studies, which we envision will enhance prediction accuracy.

While we did not find a simple mismatch between user preferences and current privacy settings that could be corrected in a fully automated way, we made significant progress toward this high-level goal. By building a model based on both qualitative and quantitative insights, we took a first step toward developing human-in-the-loop retrospective privacy-protection systems.
