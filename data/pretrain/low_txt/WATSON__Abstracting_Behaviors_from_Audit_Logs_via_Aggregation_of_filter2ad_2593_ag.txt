### Uncovering Contextual Semantics of Audit Events

Our approach to uncovering the contextual semantics of audit events is based on the TransE principle, which utilizes translational distance to match our knowledge of event usage contexts. This method differs from UNICORN [33], which employs a graph sketching algorithm to summarize long-running system executions. UNICORN leverages statistical properties of graphs to represent semantic information, whereas our approach focuses on learning contextual semantics.

### Conclusion

Abstracting high-level behaviors from low-level audit logs is crucial for effective security response. It helps bridge the semantic gap between audit events and system behaviors, thereby reducing the manual effort required for log analysis. In this paper, we introduce WATSON, an automated approach for abstracting behaviors from audit logs. WATSON addresses two primary challenges: event semantics inference and behavior summarization and aggregation. Specifically, WATSON leverages contextual information in log-based knowledge graphs to infer semantics. To distinguish representative behaviors, WATSON provides a vector representation of behavior semantics, which is used to cluster semantically similar behaviors. We evaluated WATSON using both simulated real-life cyber-attack behaviors and those from a DARPA-organized adversarial engagement. Our experimental results demonstrate that WATSON can accurately abstract both benign and malicious behaviors, significantly reducing the manual workload in attack investigations.
