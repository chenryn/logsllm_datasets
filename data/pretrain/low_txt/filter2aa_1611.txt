# _vti_Exploitation: An In-Depth Analysis of Microsoft FrontPage

## Introduction
### What is FrontPage?
- **Definition**: FrontPage is an integrated web site development tool by Microsoft.
- **Functionality**: It enables users with little to no web page experience to add basic to advanced functionality.
- **Integration**: Part of the MS Office package.
- **Security Concerns**: Known for significant security vulnerabilities.

### Vermeer Technologies
- **Background**: In early 1995, Vermeer Technologies developed one of the first web publishing tools, FrontPage.
- **Acquisition**: The application was later bought by Microsoft and integrated into the Office suite.

## Decoding the System
### Protocol Analysis
#### Client/Server Protocol
- **Communication**: Interaction between the FrontPage client and server extensions occurs over HTTP PUT requests.
- **Key Components**:
  - **Author.dll (exe)**: Handles authoring commands, content upload/download, property review, and enhancements.
  - **Admin.dll (exe)**: Manages administrative tasks such as adding users, modifying permissions, and listing accounts.
  - **Shtml.exe, vti_rpc**: Facilitates initial access and service negotiation.

### Authentication System
- **Process**: Authentication occurs with every request, including login, upload, download, permission changes, and folder navigation.
- **Resource Efficiency**: While resource-intensive, it limits state-based attacks.

## _vti_inf.html
- **Purpose**: Provides configuration information and helps determine the server's operating system.
- **Guidelines**:
  - References to `.exe` tools indicate a Unix server.
  - References to `.dll` tools indicate a Windows server.
  - Server extension version numbers can help identify the OS version.

### Version Table
- **Windows 98/ME Personal Webserver**: Version unknown.
- **Windows NT 4.0**: Version 4.x.
- **Windows 2000**: Version 5.x.
- **Windows XP**: Version 5.x.

## Understanding Vermeer RPC Packets
- **Format**: Responses from FrontPage Server Extensions are in the form of Vermeer RPC packets.
- **Structure**: These packets resemble HTML pages, with information encoded within HTML tags.
- **Sample Packet**: Contains detailed information, including physical drive locations, which may be useful for Unicode exploits.

## Debugging Server Extensions
### Using Windbg
- **Download**: Available from the Microsoft Debugging Website.
- **Symbols Configuration**: Required to determine functions being called.
- **DLLs Used**:
  - `fp4Autl.dll`
  - `ffp4Awel.dll`
  - `fp4amsft.dll`
  - `fp4Avss.dll`
  - `Author.dll`
  - `Admin.dll`

### Basic Tips
- **Resources**: Multiple guides and tutorials available.
- **Commands**:
  - `bm`: Set Breakpoints (e.g., `bm fp4Awel!*`)
  - `bc`: Clear Breakpoints
  - `g`: Go
  - `p`: Print

### Interesting Discoveries
- **Fp4Awel!Vservice**: Lists all documents on the defined web before accepting a request.
- **Fp4Awel!DSPContext:getFile, getDocument**: Called during file downloads; potential buffer overrun opportunities.
- **NTDLL**: Involved in authentication; prior attack vectors may still apply.

## Frontpage: Knocking on the Door
### fpxploiter
- **Description**: A Perl-Gtk scanning tool for finding vulnerable FrontPage accessible webservers.
- **Features**:
  - Locating webservers using default or user-defined accounts and passwords.
  - Identifying servers without passwords or with weak passwords.

### Usage
- **Start**: Run `fpxploiter`.
- **Target List**: Provide a list of host targets.
- **Password List**: Modify the password list via File->Set Password List.
- **User Account**: Change the default user account via File->Set User Account.
- **Export Results**: Save log files after scanning via File->Save Log.

## Future Directions
- **Apache Support**: Extend support for Apache FrontPage extensions.
- **Tool Redesign**: Rebuild fpxploiter as a generic FrontPage access library.
- **Language Update**: Rebuild in C/Gtk or C++/QT.
- **Content Upload**: Add support for uploading content.

## Code Availability
- **fpxploiter**: Available at [fpxploiter.org](http://www.fpxploiter.org).
- **DEFCON CD**: Also included on the DEFCON CD.

## Frontpage: What to Do When You're There
### ASP for Hackers
- **SQL Server Database Hunting**: Tools and custom ASP pages for executing queries and exploring SQL Servers.
- **fpxploiter**: Locate vulnerable servers.
- **SQLUltimate.asp**: Custom ASP code functioning as a SQL Analyzer.
- **Ideas**:
  - Add SQL Server users.
  - Access corporate data.
  - Execute extended stored procedures.
  - Locate application accounts and passwords.

### Command Line ASP
- **cmdasp.asp**: Executes console commands and returns results.
- **Examples**:
  - `netstat -a`
  - `ipconfig -all`
  - `ver`
  - `set`
  - `net users`
  - `Net localgroup`

### Future Ideas
- **Scanning**: Use ASP code with the winsock control for scanning from the webserver.
- **SMB Shares**: View SMB shares and remote administration.
- **Internal Navigation**: Use XMLHTTP controls to navigate internal websites (Intranets).

## Securing FrontPage
### Best Practices
- **Strong Passwords**: Use a mix of upper and lowercase characters, numbers, and special characters. Aim for more than eight characters.
- **Admin Account**: Change the name of the Administrator account to something meaningful but not obvious.
- **Least Privilege**: Assign only necessary access rights.
- **IP Restrictions**: Use IIS native IP-based restrictions to block external access to admin.dll and author.dll.
