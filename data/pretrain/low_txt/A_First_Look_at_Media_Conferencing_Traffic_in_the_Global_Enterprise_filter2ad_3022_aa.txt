## Abstract
Many enterprise networks have expanded beyond a single large site to encompass tens to hundreds of branch offices globally, each connected via Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) or leased lines. With the rise of globally-connected enterprises and the trend towards all-IP convergence, including the transition from traditional PBX systems to Voice over IP (VoIP) servers, IP-based audio/video conferencing for telepresence has challenged the notion that bandwidth is abundant in the enterprise. In this study, we provide an initial analysis of media conferencing traffic in the global enterprise. By instrumenting call quality and network statistics, we quantify the impact on call quality for various factors, such as wired vs. wireless access, inter- vs. intra-branch office communication, Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms like VLAN tagging and Differentiated Services (DiffServ) DSCP marking, and VPN vs. public Internet access.

## 1. Introduction
Enterprise traffic analysis has received limited attention in the networking community, partly due to the difficulty of recording enterprise traffic. Early studies found that network utilization is typically 1-3 orders of magnitude less than network capacity, suggesting that enterprise networks have ample bandwidth. However, this belief is no longer valid due to two key trends: 
1. The emergence of globally-connected enterprises spanning countries and continents, with branch offices connected by leased lines, VPNs, and public Internet connections.
2. The trend towards all-IP convergence, including the transition from PSTN-based telephone exchanges to VoIP servers and IP-based audio/video conferencing for telepresence.

The shift to VoIP and video conferencing is fundamentally altering enterprise traffic characteristics. Worldwide VoIP service revenue is projected to grow to $24.1B in 2007, up 52% from 2006, and is expected to more than double to $61.3B by 2011. Despite this rapid growth, there is a lack of large-scale, quantitative studies on the quality of service for VoIP and video conferencing in the enterprise.

In this paper, we aim to characterize the network quality of audio/video conferencing and VoIP communication within a globally-connected and diverse enterprise network. Using call logs from over 100,000 endpoints over several months, we analyze several characteristics of enterprise network traffic and provisioning, including packet loss, bandwidth utilization, and the causes and potential solutions for poor call quality.

Our main findings include:
- Endpoints on wireless networks experience poor call quality due to non-negligible packet loss rates and high packet burstiness.
- Users connected to the enterprise over VPN or from home experience significantly higher packet loss rates.
- Non-wireless calls with DiffServ QoS priority treatment rarely experience packet loss rates above 2%, a level that many audio codecs can mask.

These results have implications for both enterprise network and protocol/application design, suggesting that large enterprise networks may not always be sufficiently provisioned given the growth of media conferencing traffic.

## 2. The Globally-Connected Modern Enterprise
Unified communication, which uses an IP-based network to carry various forms of communication traffic (e.g., VoIP, video conferencing, bulk data, and instant messaging), is gaining momentum in the industry. Large enterprises are turning to unified communication to improve business processes, reduce communication delays, and enhance employee productivity. While small to medium-sized enterprise networks consist of a few LANs within a single site, large, modern enterprise networks have grown significantly, comprising multiple IP devices per employee, hundreds to thousands of employees per site, and tens to hundreds of sites worldwide.

To accommodate this geographic diversity, the scope of the modern enterprise has expanded to form a heterogeneously-connected network. Our study focuses on the deployment and growing use of IP-based telephony and conferencing within a large IT company with hundreds of branch offices globally. This network includes main campus networks in the U.S., China, and Singapore, connected via well-provisioned private lines (e.g., OC-48), and a large set of branch office sites, connected via VPN over the public Internet or leased lines, with bandwidth capacities ranging from 1.5 Mbps to 45 Mbps depending on the branch office size. 

Even within a single site, devices use both wireless and wired connectivity. Although the network is managed by a single administrative body, the distribution of branch offices makes it challenging to systematically provision all offices to meet variable traffic demands. As a result, the assumption that enterprise networks have sufficient bandwidth throughout no longer holds.

## 3. Measurement Methodology and Datasets

### 3.1. Measurement
Our datasets consist of several IP phone and audio/video conference call log databases. A call can span multiple users at multiple branch offices. Each branch office has one or more Media Control Unit (MCU) servers, which bridge the call. An audio/video stream originating at a user endpoint (client) is received at an MCU and replicated to all other participants. For a two-party call, the MCU is not involved, and the session is identified by a {user endpoint, user endpoint} pair. If any participant is on the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), a PSTN-gateway server is also involved.

For every IP phone call or audio/video conference call, a session-level report is logged at the end of the call by participating endpoints to a central reporting server. Each session log contains information for streams in both directions, including start and end timestamps, average/max packet loss, latency, average/max jitter, bandwidth capacity estimate, network quality (Network Mean Opinion Score, or NMOS), device type, audio/video codec used, bitrate, etc. While the dataset does not include packet-level traces, these call log summary statistics are useful for identifying the cause of poor call quality and allow for a first-look at new kinds of modern enterprise traffic characteristics.

### 3.2. Datasets
Table 1 describes two datasets we obtained for our characterization study. Dataset D1 consists of a log set for a "dogfood" test deployment within the enterprise, while D2 contains a recent, full log database of all calls. Because our logs comprise usage data for over 100,000 endpoints, our study focuses on a broad characterization of the pervasive IP-based conferencing traffic statistics in the enterprise network. We note that the number of distinct endpoints is larger than the number of users in the enterprise because many users make calls from several endpoints (e.g., desktop machine, wireless laptop, IP phone). We use the D2 dataset for all our analysis due to its increased log density and recency, but mention D1 here to note that the results obtained from both datasets are similar (except for call density), suggesting that the results presented in this paper cannot simply be attributed to initial deployment and provisioning hurdles.

| **Dataset** | **Start Date** | **End Date** | **#Audio Streams** | **#Video Streams** | **Distinct IP Endpoints** |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| D1          | 09/12/07       | 01/16/08     | 532,191            | 9,744,660          | 17,118                    |
| D2          | 01/21/08       | 06/22/08     | 9,744,660          | 617,018            | 205,526                   |

We supplement our datasets with location information from an internal database that contains the location of all IP subnets within the enterprise network. Specifically, the location information is in the form {IP Subnet/mask, Country, City, Building}. For each IP address in our dataset, we perform a longest-prefix match to map the location of the caller to a specific building, city, and country. For security and privacy reasons, we do not obtain router-level topology information for the enterprise network. The location database contains entries for over 7,000 subnets spanning 500 unique buildings/locations worldwide.

## 4. Data Analysis

### 4.1. Trends and Statistics
#### Growth Trends
In Figure 2, we plot the number of audio and video streams per day over a six-month period from D3. During this period, total call volume nearly tripled due to an aggressive IP phone deployment across the enterprise starting in April 2008. The number of video streams, however, did not increase as dramatically, showing only 60% growth over six months. This more gradual video stream growth is not linked to any particular external deployment effort and represents a trend towards increased video conferencing.

![Figure 2: (a) Audio trends follow call trends closely; growth in call volume was mostly due to increased VoIP and audio conferencing traffic. (b) Video calls increase slower in frequency compared to audio calls.](figure_2.png)

#### Call Patterns
We observe several types of patterns in our dataset, including time-of-day and time-of-week effects, and conference call patterns. Figure 3(a) shows the typical media traffic patterns observed at intermediate media devices (PSTN-gateways or conference stream aggregators) over a representative week. As expected, traffic exhibits a strong time-of-week effect, with peak usage during mid-week and a significant drop-off on weekends. Figure 3(b) depicts the same data for a typical Wednesday, with traffic seen between business hours and occasional peaks due to individual large conferences. We also note the existence of many larger conference calls that occur at weekly intervals, predictably producing media traffic peaks.

### 4.2. Call Quality Diagnosis
Feedback indicating poor call quality motivated us to investigate the causes and the impact of efforts to improve call quality. Several factors were considered:

- **Wired vs. Wireless Access**: Endpoints on wireless networks experience poor call quality due to non-negligible packet loss rates and high packet burstiness.
- **VPN and Home Connections**: Users connected to the enterprise over VPN or from home experience significantly higher packet loss rates.
- **QoS Mechanisms**: Non-wireless calls with DiffServ QoS priority treatment rarely experience packet loss rates above 2%, a level that many audio codecs can mask.

These results have implications for both enterprise network and protocol/application design, suggesting that large enterprise networks may not always be sufficiently provisioned given the growth of media conferencing traffic.
