### Methodology

#### Probing and RTT Calculation
To analyze the common characteristics of destinations, we use UDP probes with a limited Time-To-Live (TTL) value to force the probed router to generate ICMP error messages. The Round-Trip Time (RTT) is computed by subtracting the time of reception of the ICMP error message from the time the probe was sent.

For each selected flow class, 100 probes are sent at a constant rate (one probe every 50 ms) using the associated flow identifier (i.e., UDP source and destination ports). Only the lowest RTT is retained, which helps to eliminate over-estimation due to queuing delays. Given that probes and responses can be lost, and routers limit their ICMP packet response rate, any flow class with fewer than 90 responses is disregarded.

#### Comparison of Delays
The minimum RTT for each flow class is used as a representative of the delay over the corresponding load-balanced path. A difference of one millisecond in the representative delays is set as the threshold for declaring that two flow classes have different end-to-end delays. To ensure accuracy, delays are batched in groups of ten, and the variance of the minimum delay from each group is analyzed. These minimum delays typically have a variance of 0.5 ms or less (often less than 0.2 ms), indicating that a difference of 1 ms is significant.

### Results

We measured RTTs between 43,889 source-destination pairs with per-flow load balancing. Out of 146,296 traced pairs, only 30% traversed a per-flow load balancer. We obtained sufficient RTT samples (i.e., replies to more than 90% of our probes) for 21,791 pairs. Despite the high fraction of pairs with insufficient measurements, likely due to routers rate-limiting ICMP messages, a large number of paths were still available for study.

For most source-destination pairs, there was no significant RTT difference among load-balanced paths. Only 12% of pairs (2,644) had a delay difference of more than 1 ms. Figure 11 shows the distribution of the ratio of the shortest- to longest-delay paths for source-destination pairs. The Y-axis is logarithmic and plots the number of source-destination pairs with the delay ratio given by the X-axis. Most pairs (59%) can save at least 2% compared to the longest delay, but only 2% of pairs can save 10% or more. There are some rare cases with a 29% difference in delay, such as roncluster1 reaching a user of the MindSpring ISP through the Road Runner domain with an RTT of either 22 ms or 31 ms.

Figure 12 (left) shows the correlation between diamond lengths and delays, while Figure 12 (right) shows the correlation between diamond asymmetry and delays. Each group of vertical bars represents all the source-destination pairs traversing a diamond with a given length or asymmetry. Each individual bar represents the number of pairs having paths with either equal or different delays to the destination.

The figure indicates that longer load-balanced paths tend to have more delay differences. For short diamonds, 94% of the paths have equivalent delays. Diamonds longer than 4 lead to delay differences greater than 2 ms in nearly 40% of the cases. Symmetric diamonds (asymmetry = 0) show that 90% of the paths have equivalent delays, while this proportion decreases for asymmetric diamonds. For diamonds with an asymmetry of 2, 61% of the paths have delay differences greater than 2 ms. Interestingly, beyond an asymmetry of 2, an increase in asymmetry correlates with a decrease in the number of source-destination pairs with different delays. This could be due to the small size of the dataset or the presence of hidden MPLS paths that shorten some paths, as discussed in Section 6.3.2.

### Conclusion

Our results demonstrate that RTT gains towards some internet hosts can be achieved by controlling the ports used by an application. However, this phenomenon is not widespread enough (only 12% of the source-destination pairs with per-flow load balancing) to be widely employed for end-to-end performance improvements.

### Future Work

In future work, we plan to improve the Multipath Detection Algorithm (MDA) to handle uneven load balancing, develop a tool to find the available bandwidth under per-flow load balancing, and explore techniques to control the return flow identifier to characterize load balancing on the return path.
