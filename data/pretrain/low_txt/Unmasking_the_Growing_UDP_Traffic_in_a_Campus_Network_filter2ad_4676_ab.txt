### HTTP Port Analysis

We define a popular port as one that handles more than 0.0015% of the total traffic volume. This threshold is set based on the expected volume per port if traffic were evenly distributed across all port numbers. For source ports, there are 2,496 popular ports, accounting for 95.97% of the total traffic volume. Notably, port 53, which is well-known for DNS queries in the KAIST network, is among these. However, we cannot map the other popular port numbers to specific applications using only packet headers.

**Figure 4. Cumulative Volume by Port Number in k-2011**

### Destination Port Analysis

Applying the same analysis to destination ports, we find 594 popular ports responsible for 99.23% of the total traffic. The most significant port, 53,952, carries 5.42% of the total flow volume. Compared to the source port case, only a quarter of the destination ports carry more traffic. Out of the 594 ports, 546 have 99% of their volume coming from single nodes. Each of these nodes has a large number of flows, up to thousands, with the same destination port but different source ports. This indicates that a single destination port is used for multiple heavy-volume downloads on a single node.

### Communication Patterns Between Hosts

Our next focus is on the communication patterns between hosts of UDP flows. We aim to determine whether recent UDP traffic is from peer-to-peer (P2P) type (many-to-many) transfers or server-to-client type (one-to-many) transfers. We use a methodology similar to that of Karagiannis et al. [12]. From the flow records, we count the number of unique campus IP addresses per off-campus IP address, considering only flows larger than 100 KB. This threshold is arbitrary but sufficient to exclude DNS and scanning traffic while capturing bulk transfers.

**Figure 5(a). Off-Campus Host Popularity**

As shown in Figure 5(a), most off-campus hosts (82.5% of the total) have only one corresponding host on campus, with the maximum number of corresponding hosts being six. This suggests that no popular UDP source host exists outside the campus, and the growth in UDP traffic is not attributed to a single or several off-campus servers. In contrast, the same analysis on TCP traffic shows that the most popular server has sent traffic to 203 on-campus IPs within an hour in the same trace.

**Figure 5(b). Campus Host Popularity**

Figure 5(b) shows the number of unique off-campus IP addresses per campus IP address, with the number going up to more than a hundred. This indicates that hosts on campus download UDP traffic from a large number of external hosts. From the communication patterns by host and port in Section 3.1, we conclude that most UDP traffic is from P2P transfers rather than server-to-client transfers.

### Burstiness of UDP Traffic

UDP traffic has increased to almost 20% of the total link capacity on our congested link. If it is constant bit rate (CBR) and not adaptive to network congestion, it would reduce available bandwidth and unfairly share bandwidth with TCP flows. When UDP is a negligible portion of overall traffic, this unfair advantage is less significant. Now, it is a critical issue.

To determine if UDP flows are CBR, we calculate the standard deviation of flow throughput in one-second intervals. We perform the same calculation for TCP flows for comparison. **Figure 6** shows the cumulative distributions of the standard deviation. In k-2008, most UDP flows had zero standard deviation. By k-2011, about 18% of both UDP and TCP flows had a standard deviation greater than 1.6 Mbps, with the portion of UDP flows with almost zero variability dropping to less than 30%.

**Figure 6. Standard Deviation of Unit Time Throughput**

We also examine the burstiness of aggregate UDP traffic at finer time scales of 0.01 s, 0.1 s, and 1 s. At the 0.01 s scale, the traffic appears more bursty, while the other two scales show similar behavior.

**Figure 7. Burstiness in Aggregate UDP Traffic from k-2011**

Burstiness in traffic significantly impacts router queue and end-host buffer size provisioning. Self-similarity in Internet traffic has been well-documented, and wavelet analysis is a common technique to study scaling behavior. **Figure 8** shows the wavelet energy plot, where the variance of the wavelet coefficients reflects the variance of the traffic counting process Xj at a time scale Tj. A straight line indicates self-similarity, while a horizontal line suggests Poisson traffic.

**Figure 8. Wavelet Energy Plot for TCP and UDP Traffic from k-2011**

TCP traffic from k-2011 shows a nearly straight line, indicating self-similarity, with a Hurst parameter of 0.865. UDP traffic, however, shows a slight dip near j = 7 (time scale of 256 ms). The Hurst parameter for UDP is 0.831. Similar dips in high-speed links have been reported [25], though the cause remains unclear.

The burstiness in UDP traffic does not necessarily imply the use of congestion control by applications. MPEG-coded video can be inherently bursty. However, the communication patterns suggest P2P transfers, and the latest version of µTorrent, a popular BitTorrent client, uses a proprietary congestion control mechanism [3]. Our experiment with a µTP transfer on a controlled node shows that most data packets have a signature size of 1,466 bytes, and we identified 26.8% of total UDP traffic volume in k-2011 with this packet size. This is an upper bound, as false positives may occur in classification. The large volume of UDP flows with proprietary congestion control contributes to the new kind of burstiness in today’s Internet traffic.

### Conclusions and Discussion

In this work, we demonstrate that UDP traffic has increased 46-fold over the past four years on our campus network. Using packet header traces, we provide a first characterization report on this growth. From the 2011 trace, we found that large flows have become dominant in UDP, similar to TCP. These flows are mostly from P2P applications, and the aggregate UDP traffic exhibits burstiness similar to TCP.

Our findings offer several guidelines for classifying UDP traffic. First, port-number-based classification is ineffective for recent UDP traffic, as port numbers appear to be randomly assigned. However, a destination port, once assigned, is used for multiple downloads from different hosts and ports, similar to TCP-based P2P applications. Thus, communication patterns can be a clue, as in [11, 12]. Additionally, certain UDP packet sizes, such as 1,466 bytes in k-2011, are more frequent, making packet sizes a good signature for identifying UDP applications. This is not the case for TCP, as applications operate under TCP's policy.

Our observations on UDP traffic growth have implications for network simulation and experiments. In previous synthetic traffic experiments, UDP flows were often generated as simple CBR and ignored due to their minor volume. Our measurements show that the packet sending behavior is much more bursty than simple CBR, highlighting the need to account for "lower-than-best-effort" traffic in realistic network simulations.
