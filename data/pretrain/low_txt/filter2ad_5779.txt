**Title: Humble Beginnings, Uncertain End: Getting the Internet to Provide Performance Guarantees**

**Abstract**

One of the pioneering efforts to achieve guaranteed performance from the Internet was driven by sheer curiosity. The question, "Can it be done, and if so, how?" unexpectedly arose in the mind of a researcher with no prior experience in networking. This question became a personal challenge that haunted him until he took action. Thanks to the contributions of many other researchers (with far more extensive networking backgrounds), the topic gained significant popularity within the community for several years. Various protocols were designed and some even implemented, embodying the results of this research. Will any of these protocols ever be deployed on the Internet? Only time will tell.

**Biography**

Domenico Ferrari earned his Dr. Ing. degree in Electronics Engineering from Politecnico di Milano, Italy, in 1963. He became an Assistant Professor at Politecnico in 1967. In 1970, he joined the faculty of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, where he is now Professor Emeritus of Computer Science. From 1983 to 1987, he served as Chairman of the Computer Science Division and Associate Chairman of the Department. Starting in 1983, he was also the faculty sponsor of Berkeley's BSD Unix Project.

Domenico was one of the founders and, from its inception in April 1988 until June 1990, Deputy Director, as well as Vice President until 1995, of the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) in Berkeley. During the 1988-1995 period, he also led ICSI's Networks Group.

Since October 1995, he has been the Director of the Center for Research on the Applications of Telematics to Organizations and Society (CRATOS) at the Università Cattolica, Piacenza, Italy. In December 2000, he was appointed to the Chair of General Informatics in the College of Economics for his outstanding reputation ("chiara fama").

Throughout his career, Domenico's research has focused on switching theory, fast computer arithmetic, computer-aided design, performance analysis of computer systems, distributed systems, and networking. In 1989, he founded the Tenet Group, a team of top-notch graduate students and post-docs, which designed and built two real-time protocol suites and tested them on several networking testbeds.

Currently, he is coordinating a large regional project in the field of ICT applications to logistics and is involved in initiatives to establish e-government and e-democracy in Italy. He is also deeply committed to preserving the natural, historical, and artistic heritage of his home country, particularly in his hometown of Piacenza.

Domenico is a Fellow of the IEEE and the ACM, and he received the 1987 A. A. Michelson Award from the Computer Measurement Group.
