### DDoS Mitigation Strategies

#### Top Talkers Example (Continued)
- **Read Logs:**
  - Look for patterns for Fail2Ban or other blocking systems.
  - Block User Agents.
  - Block IPs.

- **Use Sniffer + Wireshark:**
  - Beware of SSL.
  - Using RSA?
  - Have a private key?
    - Use Snort, F5, Suricata, etc.
  - Identify unique characteristics to block on.
  - Often more time-intensive, but traffic never reaches the webserver.

#### Reacting to an Attack (Continued)
- **Sniffer + Wireshark Example:**
  - If the attack was effective, why?
  - Talk to various teams in your organization.
  - Brainstorm!
  - Deploy defenses discussed here (if not already).
  - Test network against a similar attack until defenses are effective.

- **Hack Back?**
  - SX Forum users have hacked DDoSers with some success.
  - “Is it more risky to continue the same methods of cyber defense (stand in the ring with multiple opponents just bobbing and weaving never throwing a punch) or more risky to start fighting back with jabs, combinations, head and body blows?” – Jeff Bardin, Treadstone71
  - Probably not a good idea in general.
  - “If a company can’t do defense correctly, why do you think they can do offense right? … If you can easily and positively attribute, they shouldn’t have breached your defenses. You have no business attacking them when you were negligent on defense 101.” – Brian “Jericho” Martin, attrition.org

- **Shame?**
  - Identifying and shaming DDoSers has been effective for SX.

#### Best Practices
- **Limit Connections:**
  - Use something like mod_evasion.
- **Intelligently Block Bad Traffic:**
  - Use Snort inline, Fail2ban, etc.
- **Have Sniffers in Place:**
  - For quick access to traffic.
- **Tune Webserver, Database, etc.:**
  - For performance, including log tuning.
- **Configure Webserver:**
  - Log Client IP and X-Forwarded-For.
- **Reduce Log Load:**
  - Don’t log small static content (CSS, JS, TXT, etc.).
- **Remove/Limit Search Function:**
  - Replace with Google search or require user login.
- **Avoid Hosting Public Large Files:**
  - Many DDoS attacks target large PDF files.
- **Monitoring Service:**
  - Use a service like RoboAmp.
- **Share Information:**
  - With similar companies/individuals.

#### Story Time
- **VB:**
  - VB DDoS’d SX and took it down for 5 minutes.
  - The Fixer got VB’s IP from the forums.
  - VB’s ISP used Mikrotik routers (where TheFixer used to work).
  - Remote pcap and lulz ensued.

- **BenOwns:**
  - Defrauded SX VIP and was called out for it.
  - Proceeded to DDoS the site.
  - Dox were dropped, Ben vanished.

- **Others:**
  - Many pizzas have been ordered at the expense of DDoS skids.
  - Sc0rpion, egihosting, plex0r, etc.
  - Anonymous network technicians who answered questions about various DDoS encounters.
  - RaT, Amp, The Fixer, lattera, spender, sn4ggl3, Shinobi, Kohelet, EverestX, Jericho, Jeff Bardin, Rhapsody, and the entire soldierx.com community (including irc.soldierx.com #soldierx).
  - DDoS skids for all the entertaining nights of laughing at their packets (especially the Desu attack).
