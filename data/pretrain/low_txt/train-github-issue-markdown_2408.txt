### Description
The DAG import process occasionally fails due to changes in the system configuration. Although this is a rare scenario, it is important to be notified when such failures occur. We need an alert system that sends notifications via Slack or email whenever a DAG import fails.

### Use Case/Motivation
Prompt and reliable notification of DAG import failures will help in quickly identifying and resolving issues, thereby minimizing downtime and ensuring the smooth operation of our workflows.
