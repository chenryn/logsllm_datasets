### 1. Introduction to Mobility-Aware Location Obfuscation

Existing work on mobility-aware location obfuscation techniques, such as that presented in [29], replaces real location traces with plausible fake ones using human mobility models. However, this technique is not directly applicable to fitness tracking apps, where users want to share a significant portion of their route while preserving specific segments (e.g., the area around their home).

### 2. Techniques for Preserving Endpoint Privacy

Some prior research has demonstrated techniques for preserving endpoint privacy while sharing route data. For example, Duckham and Kulik [34] propose location obfuscation methods that add dummy points to measurements with the same probability as the real user position. Ardagna et al. [27] introduce the concept of an Exclusion Privacy Zone (EPZ) to obfuscate user locations, although potential weaknesses in this method are highlighted in [52]. In our work, we demonstrate proof-of-concept attacks that can still violate user privacy even when these obfuscation techniques are employed.

### 3. Social Network Privacy in Fitness Tracking

The social networking aspect of fitness tracking services allows users to "follow" each other, providing access to additional data. This can lead to social engineering [39, 5] and automated social botnet attacks [28, 31], where user information, including location, is automatically extracted. Strava offers a privacy option requiring user approval for new followers, but when this option is not enabled, similar attacks are possible on Strava and other fitness apps. Other social network platforms have also identified various privacy vulnerabilities, including server-side surveillance [33], third-party application spying [54], and profiling of personality types [51]. Our study confirms that many of these concerns are also present in fitness tracking social networks.

### 4. Mobile Privacy in Fitness Tracking

The functionality of fitness tracking social networks relies on the ubiquity of modern smartphones equipped with GPS and other sensors. Lessons from mobile security literature regarding application permissions can be applied to improve user privacy in fitness tracking. Enck et al. [36] demonstrate a method for detecting sensor information leakage on Android through taint analysis, and they conducted a semi-automated analysis of 1,100 applications to identify security and privacy issues [37]. Felt et al. [38] found that one-third of Android apps requested unnecessary privileges. Our work suggests that overprivilege may also be a concern for third-party applications that interoperate with fitness apps.

### 5. Ethics and Disclosure

Given the potential real-world privacy implications of our study, we have taken several steps to ensure responsible research. We consulted our Institutional Review Board (IRB) and confirmed that our analysis of social media posts does not meet the definition of human subjects research, as defined in 45CFR46(d)(f) or 21CFR56.102(c)(e), and thus does not require IRB approval. Our use of social media posts aligns with prior research on user privacy [42, 56, 45, 53, 48], particularly studies evaluating location privacy and user discovery [47, 43, 49].

We disclosed our findings to Strava, Garmin Connect, and Map My Tracks. As of the publication date, all three companies have acknowledged the vulnerabilities and implemented one or more of our recommended countermeasures. Strava has adopted a spatial cloaking function and provides users with the option to re-randomize EPZs. They have also implemented measures to prevent bulk collection of public user activities, such as rate limiting, least privilege restrictions, and IP whitelisting. Garmin Connect introduced a randomization step for EPZs and added user-driven obfuscation. Map My Tracks incorporated spatial cloaking into their new EPZ feature but declined to discuss the details.

### 6. Conclusion

As fitness tracking services have grown in popularity, the online sharing of fitness data has raised concerns about personal privacy and national security. Understanding the effectiveness of privacy protections in these systems is crucial. In this paper, we conducted a deep analysis of the privacy properties of Strava, a leading fitness tracking app. While we identified a significant demand for privacy protections, we also demonstrated that current mechanisms are inadequate. Through our insights, we developed and empirically validated several novel privacy mechanisms that have been adopted by major fitness tracking services. We hope this work spurs greater interest in the efficacy and usability of privacy features in fitness tracking apps.
