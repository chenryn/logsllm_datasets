### SeBIS Results and Analysis

**Table IX: SeBIS Results—Comparison of Security Knowledge Profiles**

We compare items with different (p < 0.1) responses to items in the SeBIS in both Egelman and Peer’s study [4] and the USB experiment, as well as between the school survey and the USB experiment. The results indicate that college students have different security knowledge profiles compared to a general population.

| Question | Egelman and Peer (μ, σ) | USB (μ, σ) | t | df | p |
|----------|-------------------------|------------|----|----|---|
| I set my computer screen to automatically lock if I don’t use it for a prolonged period of time. | 3.20, 1.559 | 3.36, 1.525 | -2.060 | 74.700 | 4.26E-02 |
| When I’m prompted about a software update, I install it right away. | 3.78, 1.419 | 3.36, 1.343 | -3.360 | 69.210 | 1.27E-03 |

**Questionnaire Responses**

1. **I set my computer screen to automatically lock if I don’t use it for a prolonged period of time.**
2. **I use a password/passcode to unlock my laptop or tablet.**
3. **I manually lock my computer screen when I step away from it.**
4. **I use a PIN or passcode to unlock my mobile phone.**
5. **I do not change my passwords, unless I have to.**
6. **I use different passwords for different accounts that I have.**
7. **I do not include special characters in my password if it’s not required.**
8. **When someone sends me a link, I open it without first verifying where it goes.**
9. **I submit information to websites without first verifying that it will be sent securely (e.g., SSL, “https://”, a lock icon).**
10. **When browsing websites, I mouseover links to see where they go, before clicking them.**
11. **If I discover a security problem, I continue what I was doing because I assume someone else will fix it.**
12. **When I’m prompted about a software update, I install it right away.**
13. **I try to make sure that the programs I use are up-to-date.**

### Social Media Response

During the experiment, we monitored social media sites (e.g., Facebook and Reddit) for any descriptions of the experiment. At 11 am on the second day, a student posted a picture of one of the flash drives with attached keys to Facebook. Later that day, at 1 pm, a user posted on the university sub-Reddit about finding multiple drives on campus and stated that they reported the incident to an IT group. Commenters confirmed the presence (and non-maliciousness) of the flash drives and speculated about the purpose of the study. Two users warned readers to avoid plugging the devices into their computers. The next day, a purported IT worker posted about the “Final Exam Answers” and encouraged users not to plug in the drives.

Despite the rapid spread of news about the experiment and warnings from IT workers, the attack was still largely successful.

### Altruistic Experiences

Twice during the experiment, users returned flash drives to the researchers who were attempting to drop them. These incidents highlight the altruistic behavior of some participants and underscore the conclusions of this paper.

### Conclusion

In this study, we demonstrated that the anecdote that users will pick up and plug in found flash drives is true. In a controlled experiment at the University of Illinois, we found that the attack was effective, with an estimated 45%–98% of dropped drives being connected, and expeditious, with the first drive connected in under six minutes.

Users picked up the drives with altruistic intentions, based on the types of drives connected, the files opened, and the number of unconnected drives returned. However, nearly half of the users were driven by curiosity, first opening vacation photos instead of the prominently placed résumé. Contrary to previous beliefs, intriguing drive labels did not increase the attack's success rate. Attaching keys to the drive increased the return rate, and providing a return label led to direct contact with the owner.

The users who connected the drives did not belong to a unique subpopulation. They were neither technically incompetent nor particularly risk-loving compared to the general population. Surprisingly, they were more risk-averse than the general population in all but one DOSPERT category—recreational risk. Many users believed their computers would protect them and were either unaware of or tolerant of the actual risks of plugging in a USB drive.

This evidence serves as a reminder to the security community that less technical attacks remain a real-world threat. We need to better understand the dynamics of social engineering attacks, develop better technical defenses, and effectively educate end users about these risks.
