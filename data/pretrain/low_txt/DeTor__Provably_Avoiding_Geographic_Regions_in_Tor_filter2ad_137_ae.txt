### 6.3.2 Node Selection Analysis

The never-once and never-twice circuits (Figure 7) fall well within the distribution of normal Tor routers, as indicated by the vertical spikes in the figures. Specifically, the top 10% most frequently selected nodes appear with a frequency similar to that of the top 10% of nodes in the standard Tor network. The median 90th percentile for these nodes is almost exactly equal to that of the Tor network. However, the median node in our analysis is slightly less likely to be selected compared to the Tor network, suggesting a minor bias towards more popular nodes.

### 6.3.3 Circuit Performance

We further examine the performance of successful DeTor never-twice circuits, focusing on latency and expected bandwidth. Figure 13 compares the round-trip times (RTTs) of successful never-twice DeTor circuits to those of regular Tor circuits. Compared to the never-once circuits (Figure 8), we observe that some never-twice DeTor circuits exhibit higher RTTs. This indicates that never-twice avoidance can draw from a more diverse set of links, especially when the entry and exit nodes are geographically distant.

Figure 14 reinforces this finding, showing that the distribution of successful never-twice bandwidths closely matches that of the full Tor network, indicating access to a broader set of routers.

### 6.3.4 Factors Influencing Circuit Success

To conclude, we investigate the factors that influence the success or failure of never-twice DeTor circuits. Figure 15 plots the fraction of possible never-twice circuits that were found to be successful as a function of the ratio D(e,m,x)/D(s,e,m,x,t). This ratio represents the proportion of the circuit's length attributable to the middle legs, excluding the entry and exit legs.

Several interesting patterns emerge from this figure. When the ratio is very low, it means that the circuit is dominated by the entry and exit legs, leading to a high likelihood of intersection. As expected, few circuits succeed under these conditions. DeTor succeeds more frequently as the middle legs take up a larger fraction of the circuit's distance. However, success rates begin to decline as the middle legs approach the combined length of the entry and exit legs. This decline is due to the increased probability of intersection, particularly when the middle legs are approximately as long as the entry and exit legs, often corresponding to circuits made from two tightly packed clusters of nodes (e.g., one in North America and the other in Europe).

When the middle legs dominate the circuit's distance (the ratio approaches one), we see another specific pattern: these high-ratio values correspond to circuits where the source and entry nodes are both in North America (or Europe), and the middle legs traverse the Atlantic. The success rate in this regime is influenced by the geographical diversity of the Tor routers.

In summary, DeTor prefers circuits with disproportionately large or small middle legs relative to the entry and exit legs. This preference may be influenced by the geographical distribution of nodes in the Ting dataset used in our analysis. The overall success rate of never-twice avoidance is dependent on the geographical diversity of Tor router locations.

### 7 Conclusion

In this paper, we have introduced techniques that enable end-users to verify whether packets over their Tor circuits have avoided traversing a geographic region once or twice. Our system, DeTor, builds upon prior work on provable avoidance routing [24] and extends it to handle multiple hops in Tor and achieve "never-twice" avoidance. Through extensive simulations using real Tor latency data [6], we have demonstrated that DeTor can provide provable avoidance for most source-destination pairs, even when avoiding large, routing-central countries like the United States.

While the dataset used in evaluating DeTor comes from live Tor measurements [6], the scale and geographical distribution of the data do not fully represent the entire Tor network. Our results suggest that having more Tor routers would increase the potential number of DeTor circuits and improve overall success rates. A longitudinal study with real users on the Tor network would be an ideal next step for evaluation. This work represents the first step towards bringing provable avoidance to Tor, and we believe DeTor has the potential to be a powerful tool in future defenses against censorship and deanonymization.
