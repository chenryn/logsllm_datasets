### Summary of QFind Experimental Results and Analysis

#### Data Collection
In January 2004, we received experimental results from 47 QFind volunteers, primarily from the Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) Computer Science (CS) community, including undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty. These volunteers used 16 different Internet Service Providers (ISPs), with the distribution as follows:
- Charter: 16 users
- Verizon: 11 users
- Comcast: 4 users
- Speakeasy: 4 users
- Earthlink: 2 users
- AOL, Winternet, RR, RCN, NetAccess, MTS, Cyberonic, Cox, Covad, Adelphia: 1 user each

The home nodes of the QFind volunteers had five different operating systems:
- Windows XP: 18 users
- Windows 2000: 11 users
- Linux: 6 users
- Mac OS-X: 3 users
- Windows 98: 1 user
- Unreported: 12 users

Approximately one-third of the volunteers connected their home nodes to their broadband ISPs via a wireless LAN.

#### Network Performance
- **Throughput**: About 45% of the volunteers used DSL, and 55% used cable modems. The cumulative density functions (CDFs) for throughput showed that cable modems had a sharp increase corresponding to a standard 768 Kbps downlink capacity, which was also the median capacity. Above this median, the distributions separated, with cable modems achieving substantially higher throughput than DSL.
- **Ping Times**: The CDFs for maximum ping times indicated a median max ping time of about 200 ms. However, the median for DSL (350 ms) was significantly higher than for cable (175 ms). Ping times of 350 ms can significantly affect interactive applications. The entire body of the DSL CDF was to the right of the cable CDF, indicating a significant difference in max ping times between DSL and cable. Maximum ping times for cable could be up to a second, while for DSL, they could exceed a second, which is detrimental to real-time interaction.

#### Data Filtering
To ensure the accuracy of the data, we winnowed the full dataset by removing measurements where any pair of throughputs or maximum ping times differed by more than 10%. This process removed data from 17 users, and all subsequent analysis was based on the winnowed dataset.

#### Inferred Access Queue Sizes
- **General Comparison**: The CDFs for inferred access queue sizes showed a marked difference between DSL and cable. Cable queues were generally under 20 Kbytes, while DSL queues were larger. The steep increase in DSL queue sizes around 60 Kbytes was near the limit of the receiver window size of most operating systems (64 Kbytes).
- **ISP-Specific Comparison**:
  - **Charter vs. Non-Charter Cable**: There were some differences in the distributions, with Charter cable queues appearing slightly smaller than non-Charter cable queues.
  - **Verizon vs. Non-Verizon DSL**: There were very few differences between the different DSL provider distributions, suggesting common queue size settings across providers.

#### Summary
- **QFind Methodology**: The QFind methodology for inferring queue sizes is attractive because it uses standard pings and web browser downloads, requiring no custom software or special end-host configuration. It also uses a single TCP flow, avoiding excessive congestion.
- **Accuracy**: Simulation and emulation results showed that QFind could effectively infer queue sizes, but measurement results suggested it was less accurate in practice. Multiple QFind experiments helped ensure consistent results, but this led to discarding many data samples.
- **DSL vs. Cable**: Based on the winnowed dataset, DSL appeared to have significantly smaller access queues than cable, and the corresponding ping delays when such queues were full could significantly degrade interactive applications with real-time constraints.

#### Future Work
Future work could explore technologies used for bandwidth estimation, such as those that detect congestion by filling router queues. While these techniques may provide more accurate results, they require custom software and may be intrusive, so their benefits would need to be weighed against these drawbacks.
