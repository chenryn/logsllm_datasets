### Optical TEMPEST Attacks and the Glowworm Attack

#### Introduction to Optical TEMPEST
Optical TEMPEST attacks exploit the intensity variations of a device's power indicator LED to infer information about the device's internal operations. The intensity of the LED can provide a high-resolution (GHz) approximation of the device's power consumption [48]. However, the primary limitation lies in the electro-optical sensors used, which typically have a frequency bandwidth limited to a few MHz. Consequently, only power analysis attacks with sampling rates below a few MHz are practical. Despite this, it has been demonstrated that many attacks, such as RSA key recovery, can be performed with very low sampling rates (a few kHz) using acoustic signals [29].

#### The Glowworm Attack
The Glowworm attack is an optical TEMPEST attack that recovers sound from the power indicator LED of a device. The quality of the recovered sound is directly proportional to the quality of the eavesdropping equipment. In our study, we used a $1000 setup, including a $250 telescope, a $250 electro-optical sensor, and a $500 analog-to-digital converter (ADC). This setup allowed us to recover speech from a distance of 35 meters. To increase the attack range and improve sound quality, more expensive professional equipment, such as a more sensitive ADC and a professional telescope, would be required. Such equipment could enable the recovery of sound from devices with very weak LED intensities, like the Google Nest Mini or Creative Pebble speakers.

#### Limitations and Variability
Some electrical circuits are not vulnerable to the Glowworm attack due to the presence of voltage stabilizers and filters that alter the linear response of the LED to power consumption. For example, while the power indicator LED of Logitech S120 speakers leaks information about the played sound, other Logitech Z200 speakers do not, as shown in Fig. 16.

#### Future Work
For future research, we suggest:
1. **Improving the Glowworm Attack**: Investigate methods to enhance the attack without relying on expensive equipment. This could involve using advanced models, such as artificial bandwidth extension techniques [37, 38, 45, 55, 56].
2. **Recovering Non-Acoustic Information**: Explore the possibility of recovering non-acoustic information from devices via their power indicator LEDs, such as optical cryptanalysis.
