### Version
2.6.8

### Reproduction Link
[CodeSandbox Example](https://codesandbox.io/s/wwoxp636jk)

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Add a click event listener on the `window` object within a child component.

### Expected Behavior
In versions of Vue prior to 2.6, the click event was not propagated to the child component because it had not yet been created and mounted.

### Actual Behavior
In Vue 2.6.8, the click event is now propagated to the child component after it has been created and mounted.

### Question
Do I now need to explicitly add the `.stop` modifier to all parent click events if I add click listeners on the `window` in my child components?
