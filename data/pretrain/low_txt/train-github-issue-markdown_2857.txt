React has introduced a new JSX transform, which is now supported in TypeScript 4.1. You can find more details about this update in the official announcement: [TypeScript 4.1 Beta - JSX Factories](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-1-beta/#jsx-factories).

We should carefully evaluate the implications of this change for Deno, particularly in relation to the `--no-check` flag.
