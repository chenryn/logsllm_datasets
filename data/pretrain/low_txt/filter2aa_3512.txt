**Presenters:**

#### Introduction
This presentation delves into a four-year-long investigation into the ecosystem of social media manipulation, focusing on the Linux/Moose botnet. Our research encompasses various investigative techniques, a comprehensive mapping of all involved actors, and an in-depth analysis of the malware's impact on routers and IoT devices.

#### Linux/Moose Botnet
**Overview:**
- **Type:** An IoT botnet
- **Function:** Conducts social media manipulation
- **Affected Devices:** Routers and Internet of Things (IoT) devices
- **System:** Embedded Linux systems with busybox userland
- **Behavior:** Worm-like, using telnet credential brute force
- **Payload:** Proxy service (SOCKSv4/v5, HTTP, HTTPS)

#### Investigative Techniques
**Honeypots:**
- **Type:** Software-based, low interaction
- **Setup:** Side-loaded ARM virtual machine, intentionally infected

**HTTPS Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:**
- **Objective:** Access raw traffic
- **Findings:**
  - Several infected hosts actively used by operators
  - HTTPS traffic in plaintext
  - Command and Control (C&C) traffic
  - Publicly available seller market

**Whitelisted IPs and Reseller Model:**
- **Variables Analyzed:**
  - Honeypots used
  - Targeted websites
  - TLS fingerprints
  - User agents
  - API calls
  - Timestamps
- **Observations:**
  - Fake accounts pinned to a given honeypot
  - Originating from a single whitelisted IP address
  - Whitelisted IP addresses run on Windows servers
  - Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is actively used

#### Automation Software
**Investigation:**
- **Objective:** Identify the Linux/Moose provider
- **Features Identified:**
  - Mobile and desktop user-agents
  - Socks proxy support
  - Custom browsing patterns
  - Different business models (unlimited accounts, one-time fee, pay-per-month, pay-per-account)

**Automation Software Summary:**
- **GramDominator / Socinator:**
  - .Net, CEF, not packed, no socks proxy support
- **FollowAdder:**
  - Xojo/REALBasic, CEF, obscure Xojo framework, no unlimited accounts
- **MassPlanner:**
  - C++/.Net, CEF, Themida/WinLicense 2.x, one overridable user-agent
- **FollowingLike:**
  - .Net, BotSocial custom browser, ILProtector, custom user-agent feature too recent
- **FollowLiker:**
  - Java compiled to native code, HtmlUnit Java Library, Excelsior JET, different Instagram interaction

#### Reseller Panels
**Findings:**
- **Reseller Model:**
  - Not at the botnet level, found in decrypted traffic
  - Sell popularity in bulk
  - All panels look similar

**Investigation:**
- **Sample Size:** N=343
- **Analysis:**
  - Web application fingerprint
  - Domain registration information
  - HTML content
  - IP address

**Reseller Panel Providers:**
- **All-in-One Solution:**
  - Ready-to-go software
  - Web hosting
  - Domain name sometimes included
- **Features:**
  - API for receiving and sending orders
  - Worker tracking

**Conversations:**
- Multiple discussions by reseller panel owners on BlackHatWorld about the main provider

#### Residential Proxy Services
**New Actor:**
- **Previously Studied Botnet:**
  - Residential proxy services
  - Shocking business model

**Providers:**
- **Storm Proxies:**
  - IPs from USA (Kansas City, Lincoln NE, Sunnyvale CA)
  - Conflicting ISP information
  - Uses Squid, likely Debian Jessie
- **RSocks:**
  - IPs from Russia, ISP: Adman LLC
  - Exposes SSH on port 3389, likely Debian Jessie
- **Valar Solutions:**
  - Single IP from France, Scaleway, Dedibox
  - Traffic via IPv6 in the USA, AT&T Internet Services
  - Uses 3Proxy, confirmed by nmap and error messages

**Summary:**
- **Infrastructure:**
  - GeoIP/Whois
  - Powered by malware (unlikely for most providers)

#### Potential Buyers
**Linux/Moose:**
- **Traffic Focus:**
  - 86% on Instagram
  - 522 potential customer accounts
- **Method:**
  - Content analysis
- **Categories:**
  - Entertainment Industry (20%)
  - Selling Products and Services (21%)
  - Personal Profiles (26%)

**Experiment:**
- **Cost Analysis:**
  - $95 for 10,000 followers
  - $22.5 per 10,000 follows
  - 45 orders of 10,000 follows
  - 450,000 follows a day
  - 11,382 bots
  - One client = $365,000/year

#### Recommendations
**Policy Makers:**
- Regulate the sale of social media manipulation
- Target the middle-man

**Law Enforcement:**
- Increase the costs of creating fake likes and follows

**Individuals:**
- Focus on content rather than the container
- Question the legitimacy of posts and sources
