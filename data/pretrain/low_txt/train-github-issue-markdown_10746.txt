The Scrapy documentation recommends adhering to the PEP8 coding conventions for any code intended for inclusion in Scrapy, with the exception of the 79-character line length rule. Upon running the `pep8` utility, I have identified several instances of PEP8 violations in the master branch. With the approval of the maintainers, I would be happy to address and resolve these issues.
