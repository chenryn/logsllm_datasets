### n-GRAM STROKE DISTRIBUTIONS IN FIRST STUDY
**APPENDIX D**

Figure 10 illustrates the stroke distribution in the three n-gram models selected for the first study. The start strokes exhibit a bias towards rightward and downward directions, while center strokes are generally short. Final strokes are more likely to involve rightward motion.

#### Figure 10: Distribution of Strokes in Optimized n-Gram Models
- **Top Row:** 2x10 n-gram model
- **Center Row:** 3x10 n-gram model
- **Bottom Row:** 4x12 n-gram model

**Columns:**
- **Left Column:** Data from start strokes
- **Center Column:** Data from all other strokes
- **Right Column:** Data from final strokes

Each figure is divided into the discretization regions available in the given n-gram model. The frequency of sub-strokes observed in each region is marked in percentages and color-coded. Boundary regions are shown to scale as grey areas, indicating both length and angle. The proportion of strokes used in each region (black text) and boundary (grey text) is displayed at the boundary (for angles) and the bottom of each diagram (for lengths).

### n-GRAM STROKE DISTRIBUTIONS IN SECOND STUDY
**APPENDIX E**

Figure 11 shows the stroke distribution in n-gram models generated for all four policies in the second study. The start stroke direction exhibits the greatest bias in the baseline policy. Center strokes are typically short, and final strokes tend to be rightward.

#### Figure 11: Distribution of Strokes in n-Gram Models for Different Policies
- **Top Row:** Baseline policy
- **Center-Top Row:** Lexical policy
- **Center-Bottom Row:** Blacklist policy
- **Bottom Row:** Consolidated policy

Each model uses the configuration of the optimized 3x10 model from the first study.

**Columns:**
- **Left Column:** Data from start strokes
- **Center Column:** Data from all other strokes
- **Right Column:** Data from final strokes
