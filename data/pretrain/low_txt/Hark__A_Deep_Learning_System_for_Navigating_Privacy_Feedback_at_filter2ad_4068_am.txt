### D. Additional Analysis Graphs

In addition to the figures presented in Section IX, we provide further statistical insights in Figures 15 and 16. Figure 15 illustrates the distribution of the number of issues per app, while Figure 16 shows the distribution of the number of reviews per issue. Among the apps with privacy issues, the median number of privacy issues is 2. For issues that have 10 or more reviews, the median number of such issues is 25. Notably, a few issues are particularly popular, appearing in tens of thousands of reviews.

### E. Qualitative Examples

Table V presents examples of the outputs generated by Hark compared to the baselines for the privacy classifier, issue generation, and theme title generation models, respectively.

### Appendix

#### A. Models’ Parameters

Table III lists the main hyperparameters for the various models trained in this paper. All models are fine-tuned versions of T5-11B. For our qualitative analysis in Section IX, we set a privacy classifier threshold of 0.91, resulting in an average precision of 83% and an average recall of 82% on Hark’s test set.

#### B. Privacy Classifier Data Analysis

Figure 14 provides a breakdown of how each concept described in Table II is represented in our sampled dataset used for manual labeling in Section V-B2. The figure also shows the distribution by ground truth label, indicating that these concepts are predominantly privacy-related when they occur.

#### C. Emotions Classifier Results

Table IV details the classification results of the emotions classifier.

| Excellent app to offer for sale or buy items that other people no longer need. Easy to use, good results. I prefer this app over others that are offered. They also keep your safety in mind. They remind you not to give out your phone number or your address. | Safety Reminders, Phone Number Protection, Address Protection                                                   | Sale, Buy Items, Results                                                                                         | Identity Security, No Phone Numbers Required, No Email Address Required                                          |

| So far the best way to sell stuff. It has a very large market of users which provides great response time once posting an item for sale. Also lets you view what other people rated the seller so some trust can be added to the transaction.
