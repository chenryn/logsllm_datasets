### Issue Related to #5286

When an item is selected using the `ng-link` directive, the class `ng-link-active` is only added if there are no parameters within the `ng-link` directive. 

**Problem:**
- The class `ng-link-active` fails to be added when the `ng-link` directive includes a parameter.

**Example:**
- For a link without parameters, the class `ng-link-active` is correctly applied.
- For a link with parameters, the class `ng-link-active` is not applied.

**Affected Link:**
- `About` (with parameters)

Please address this issue to ensure that the `ng-link-active` class is consistently applied, regardless of whether the `ng-link` directive contains parameters.
