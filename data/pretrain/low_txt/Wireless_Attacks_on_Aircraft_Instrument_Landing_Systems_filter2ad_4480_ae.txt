### Security Vulnerabilities in the Aviation Industry: A Case Study of ILS Attacks

#### Abstract
While cryptographic authentication can address some security issues in the aviation industry, it is ineffective against Instrument Landing System (ILS) attacks, as demonstrated in this paper.

#### 7. Conclusion
In this study, we conducted the first comprehensive security evaluation of the aircraft instrument landing system (ILS) against wireless attacks. Through both simulations and experiments using aviation-grade commercial ILS receivers and a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-recommended flight simulator, we demonstrated that an attacker can precisely control the approach path of an aircraft without alerting the pilots, particularly during low-visibility conditions. We also discussed potential countermeasures, such as failsafe systems like GPS, and highlighted that these systems do not provide sufficient security guarantees. Additionally, we identified unique challenges in developing a scalable and secure aircraft landing system.
