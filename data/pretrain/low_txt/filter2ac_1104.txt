**ATT&CK ID:** M1026  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Privileged Account Management

**Description:**

Regularly audit domain and local accounts, along with their associated permission levels, to identify potential situations that could allow an adversary to gain broad access by obtaining credentials of a privileged account. [5][6] These audits should also check for the following:
- Whether default accounts have been enabled.
- If new local accounts have been created without proper authorization.

To further mitigate risks, follow best practices for the design and administration of an enterprise network, with a focus on limiting the use of privileged accounts across different administrative tiers. [7]
