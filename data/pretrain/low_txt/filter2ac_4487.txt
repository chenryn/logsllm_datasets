**ATT&CK ID:** T1098.003  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Additional Cloud Roles

An adversary may add additional roles or permissions to an adversary-controlled cloud account to maintain persistent access to a tenant. For example, in cloud-based environments, adversaries might modify Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to grant themselves elevated privileges. In Office 365 environments, they may add a new global administrator account. With sufficient permissions, a compromised account can gain nearly unrestricted access to data and settings, including the ability to reset the passwords of other administrators. This technique allows the adversary to maintain long-term control over the environment, even if some accounts are detected and disabled.
