## What is Bluetooth?
Bluetooth is a wireless standard for exchanging data over short distances. It operates in the 2.4 to 2.485 GHz short-wavelength UHF band, using 79 channels and Adaptive Frequency Hopping (AFH). The name "Bluetooth" comes from Harald Bluetooth, a 10th-century Danish king, as a nod to Scandinavian humor.

### Layer Protocol Architecture
- **Core Protocols**: LMP, L2CAP, SDP
- **Cable Replacement Protocols**
- **Telephony Control Protocols**
- **Adopted Protocols**

### Key Features
- **LMP, L2CAP, SDP are mandatory**.
- **Version Updates**:
  - **1.0**: Mandatory BD_ADDR
  - **1.1**: IEEE Standard (2002)
  - **1.2**: Adaptive frequency-hopping spread spectrum for better resistance to interferences and eavesdropping
  - **2.0**: EDR (Enhanced Data Rate) for faster data transfer, GFSK+PSK modulation
  - **2.1**: Secure Simple Pairing, Extended Inquiry Response
  - **3.0**: Alternative MAC/PHYs for high data transfer, Unicast Connectionless Data
  - **4.0**: Includes Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol
  - **4.1**: Limited discovery time, lower power consumption, LE link layer topology
  - **4.2**: LE Data packet extension, LE secure connections, Link Layer privacy

## Known and Unknown Risks
### BlueSnarf
- **When**: Late 2003
- **What**: Exploits the OBEX protocol in mobile phones and pocket PCs
- **Why**: Insecure implementation of OBEX; no authentication required, easy GET requests to common files (calendar, contacts), no user prompts

### BlueBug
- **When**: 2004 @DEFCON12
- **What**: Exploits Bluetooth implementation on mobile phones, especially Symbian OS
- **Why**: Security loophole; no secure authentication prior to v2.0, control device through plain serial connection, download items via OBEX without prompts

### Legacy Pairing Procedure (pre-v2.0)
- **Encryption Algorithm**: Vulnerable to attacks due to weak encryption
- **Authentication Procedure**: Previously evaluated Link Key, vulnerable to brute-force attacks

### Secure Simple Pairing
- **Encryption Bypass**: By Mark Ryan, involving eavesdropping and decrypting with three different keys (TK, STK, LTK)

### BlueChop
- **What**: Disrupts any Bluetooth piconet from the outside by spoofing a random slave out of the piconet
- **How**: Contacts the master, causing confusion in the masterâ€™s internal state, leading to piconet disruption

### Bluetooth LE Encryption Bypass
- **Eavesdropping vs. Decrypting**: Requires saving the key exchange procedure
- **Key Types**: TK, STK, LTK
- **Brute-Force Attacks**: Intel i7, one core, less than 1 second for brute-forcing

## SmartUnlock
### Overview
- **Android 5.0**: Introduced SmartUnlock, which enables unlocking the smartphone without user interaction under certain conditions:
  - NFC tag in range
  - Within a certain location
  - Recognized face
  - Connected to a trusted Bluetooth device
  - In contact with a body

### Bluetooth Unlock
- **Functionality**: User sets a paired Bluetooth device as trusted, and the lockscreen is bypassed when the device is connected.
- **Vulnerabilities**:
  - **Android 5.1**: Adds new features but remains vulnerable through APIs.
  - **API Vulnerability**: No safe method to check if a device is connected with a proper Link Key (LK).
  - **Fix Status**:
    - **Android >= 5.1**: SmartUnlock is fixed, but APIs are still vulnerable.
    - **Android <= 5.0.X**: Both SmartUnlock and APIs are vulnerable.
  - **Importance of Fixing API**: Third-party applications can exploit vulnerabilities.

## Future Works
- **Focus Areas**:
  - IoT Devices
  - Smart Locks
  - Fit Bands
  - Other Bluetooth-enabled devices
