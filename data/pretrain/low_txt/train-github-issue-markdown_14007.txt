I have been developing a custom debug adapter for Visual Studio Code and have encountered the following issue:

When deploying the extension in server mode (I have not tested it in extension host mode), if the client is abruptly terminated for any reason while the frontend is still awaiting a response to a `scopesRequest` or `variablesRequest` that affects the Variables Debug View, the values in the view remain and become locked. Even after the client has stopped, these values persist. Starting a new debug session does not clear them; you must open a new window with the project to clear the values.

The following screenshots illustrate this issue:

1. **While debugging on the client:**
   - The adapter project is being debugged in server mode.
   - The debugger is paused, and there is an unfulfilled `scopesRequest` or `variablesRequest`.

2. **After stopping the server without completing the request:**
   - The client's Variables Debug View remains locked with the last displayed values.

This issue has occurred in both the January and Insider builds of Visual Studio Code.
