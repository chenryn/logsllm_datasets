### Promise of Choice Between Route Length and Risk Exposure

The method allows for a choice between route length and risk exposure, enabling the selection of routes that pass through certain metropolitan areas while avoiding others. In many instances, this limited set of non-dominated solutions may be sufficient to provide the decision-maker with a clear evaluation. This result highlights the parametric method's ability to offer diverse choices efficiently in multi-objective decision-making.

### Subsequent Solutions and Their Impact

Subsequent solutions do enhance our understanding of the distribution of non-dominated solutions. However, most of these solutions may only represent minor deviations from the representative solutions, as they are generated within a confined feasible region between previously identified non-dominated solutions. After a certain number of iterations, newly generated non-dominated solutions may be only marginally different from their predecessors. For example, as shown in Figures 7 and 8, the next six solutions (i.e., the 7th–12th solutions) generated by the parametric search process are largely similar to their earlier counterparts. Specifically, Path 9 is only slightly different from Path 2 on a few road segments between Newark and New York City, and Path 10 and Path 11 are both very close to Path 6, with the only differences being a short section from Massachusetts to New Hampshire and road segments from Allentown to Scranton, Pennsylvania. From a practical standpoint, incorporating these new solutions may add only marginal value in providing additional insights for final decision-making.

### Tri-Objective Routing Case

#### Comparison of Bi-Objective and Tri-Objective Solutions

First, we compared the complete sets of non-dominated solutions for bi-objective and tri-objective problem instances (generated using the labeling method). In this study, the bi-objective problem yielded 39 non-dominated solutions, while the tri-objective problem produced 40 solutions. We found that the bi-objective case, which combines accident rate and population size, serves as a good approximation to the original tri-objective problem—34 out of 40 non-dominated solutions of the tri-objective problem were present in the solution set of the bi-objective problem, covering all the representative non-dominated solutions shown above.

#### Decomposition and Solution Generation

For the tri-objective problem instance, we applied the decomposition scheme with the bi-objective constrained parametric method to generate non-dominated solutions. Additionally, we implemented an extended tri-objective labeling method based on Brumbaugh-Smith and Shier’s (18) approach to obtain the complete solution set. The non-dominated solutions of the three bi-objective subproblems are summarized in Table 2: the route length-population size subproblem (first column), the accident rate-population size subproblem (second column), and the route length-accident rate subproblem (third column), which generated 27, 5, and 10 solutions, respectively. As an illustration, the non-dominated solution profiles of the three bi-objective subproblems are depicted in Figure 9, showing a close match between the results from the constrained parametric method and the label-correcting method. A synthesis of these non-dominated solutions results in a union set of 34 non-dominated solutions for the tri-objective problem (fourth column in Table 2), achieving a solution identification rate of 85% (i.e., 34 out of 40). This rate is significantly higher than the 76.9% (i.e., 30 out of 39) achieved in the aforementioned bi-objective problem instance.

### Concluding Remarks

This article presents an alternative optimization approach for the multi-objective hazardous materials routing problem. The proposed constrained parametric method differs from existing methods in several ways:
1. Compared to parametric methods, it can identify both extreme and non-extreme non-dominated paths.
2. Compared to labeling methods, it operates in polynomial time and prioritizes finding a set of representative supporting solutions efficiently.

This latter feature makes it particularly useful in time-constrained computing environments, such as real-time, en route applications. Even in planning applications, it offers significant computational benefits, as generating the entire non-dominated solution set is typically not required in most real-world, large-scale problems (Current et al., 1990).

The reduced computational cost of the parametric algorithm is due to the use of an approximate label-setting procedure that solves the parameterized, doubly constrained shortest path subproblem in polynomial time. Although it may not guarantee solution completeness, the parametric algorithm is capable of finding all extreme non-dominated solutions and a large part of non-extreme non-dominated solutions. Extended versions of the parametric algorithm have greater potential in more complex multi-objective routing problems, such as those with stochastic, time-varying attributes, alternative routing policies, and/or extra routing restrictions. In these complex cases, the combinatorial complexity may be exponentially higher than in deterministic, static counterparts. The parametric optimization idea presented here should be further explored to develop efficient, practically implementable solution methods that can characterize efficient solution sets for these more challenging problems in a prompt manner.
