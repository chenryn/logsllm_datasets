## Introduction
- **Welcome**
- **A Perfect Storm**: The convergence of Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies and the vulnerabilities in PEAP (Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol) creates a significant security challenge.

### Overview of PEAP
- **PEAP: Pwned Extensible Authentication Protocol**
  - Joshua Wright and Brad Antoniewicz highlighted the issues with PEAP at ShmooCon.
  - "It’s amazing to me that lots of people seemed to have missed this issue in PEAP and other EAP methods, as it’s still extremely useful in most of the pen-tests I engage in." — Joshua Wright, May 1, [Year]
  - Windows and OS X are vulnerable, and tools like FreeRADIUS-WPE can exploit these vulnerabilities.
  - "PEAP and TTLS can be secure when deployed carefully" — Source: [Link]

### Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)
- **Growth**: 70-80% of companies now support BYOD.
- **EAP Types**: Different mobile platforms support various EAP types, including PEAP, EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, and EAP-FAST.

## CloudCracker
- **Moxie Marlinspike, David Hulton, Marsh Ray** presented at DEF CON XX.
- **MS-CHAPv2 Vulnerability**: "Enterprises who are depending on the mutual authentication properties of MS-CHAPv2 for connection to their WPA RADIUS servers should immediately start migrating to something else." — Moxie Marlinspike, July 2, [Year]
- **Divide and Conquer**: CloudCracker can crack MS-CHAPv2 in 24 hours.

## Key Takeaways
- **Real-world Deployments are Messy**: Many organizations do not implement PEAP correctly.
- **PEAP is Unsafe for BYOD Environments**: The impact of PEAP vulnerabilities is enormous.
- **Immediate Corrective Action Required**: There is no easy fix, and users have control over their devices.

### Bottom Line
- **Defense**: Implement robust security measures.
- **Offense**: Be aware of the potential attack vectors.

### Some Disagree
- **Counterpoint**: "In a properly implemented wireless network, this MS-CHAPv2 exploit is a non-issue. There is no need for Wi-Fi network administrators to abandon PEAP. Period." — [Source]

### Risk Characteristics
- **Lower Risk**: Individual users, smaller organizations, and static user bases.
- **Higher Risk**: Internal network assets, larger organizations, and transient user bases.

### Misconfiguration is Everywhere
- **Example**: Educational institutions often have misconfigured networks.

## Prerequisite Knowledge
- **PEAP**: Why is it popular?
- **EAP Type Support**:
  - **iOS**: Supports PEAP, EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, EAP-FAST.
  - **Android**: Supports PEAP, EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS.
  - **Windows Phone**: Supports PEAP, EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, EAP-FAST.
  - **BlackBerry**: Supports PEAP, EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, EAP-FAST.

### Wireless Authentication Comparison
- **Access Control Granularity**:
  - **Open**: None
  - **WPA**: Group of users who know the password
  - **WPA Enterprise**: Individual user accounts
- **Response to Credential Compromise**:
  - **Open**: N/A
  - **WPA**: Change password, update all devices
  - **WPA Enterprise**: Modify single user account

## Attacking PEAP
- **Methodology**:
  - **Single Network**: Traditional attack
  - **Multiple Networks**: Curated lists based on geographical or industry criteria
  - **All The Devices**: Challenges and stories
- **Tools**:
  - **FreeRADIUS-WPE**
  - **hostapd & hostapd-wpe**
  - **DD-WRT & OpenWrt**
- **Future Developments**:
  - ***WRT scripts and integration**
  - **hostapd-python-script**: [GitHub Link]
  - **Dynamic target selection and GPS integration**

## Solutions
- **How to Fix This**:
  - **Hide yo’ kids, hide yo’ WiFi**: A humorous but impractical solution.
  - **EAP-TLS**: A more secure alternative.
  - **Better Mobile Device Management (MDM)**
- **PEAP vs. EAP-TLS**:
  - **Support**: Nearly universal for both
  - **Server Authentication**: Yes for both
  - **User Authentication**: MS-CHAPv for PEAP, Certificate for EAP-TLS
  - **Ease of Configuration and Management**: PEAP is easier to configure and manage than EAP-TLS.
- **PEAP Mitigations**:
  - **Doing PEAP “Right”**
  - **Mobile Device Management (MDM)**
  - **Custom CA vs. Public CA**
  - **Separate Accounts**

## Demo
- **DefConSecure**: Hacking the hackers
- **Victims Needed**:
  - **Fair Warning**: Turn off all WiFi devices if you do not wish to participate.
  - **Targeting DefConSecure**: No Man-in-the-Middle (MitM), only collecting usernames and MS-CHAPv challenge/response.
  - **Brief Denial of Service**: Passwords will not be cracked, but collected for demonstration purposes.
