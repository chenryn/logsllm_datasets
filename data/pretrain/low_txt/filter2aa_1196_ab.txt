### Summary of Antivirus Products and Data Exfiltration

The following antivirus products were tested for their ability to facilitate data exfiltration from "isolated" endpoints:

- **Comodo Client Security 8.3.0.5216** (Persistence: DNS, HTTP)
- **BitDefender Total Security 2017** (Build 21.0.23.1101, Engine v. 7.69800)

Out of the 10 major antivirus products tested, 4 (Avira, ESET, Kaspersky, and Comodo) were found to enable data exfiltration.

### Insights on AV Sandboxes

We identified 44 different sandbox instances across 22 templates, which can be categorized into 10 classes based on their computer names:

#### Class: namePC
- **Template:** 1 template, 13 instances (e.g., REYNAPC, MALVAPC, ELEANOREPC, etc.)
- **Operator:** ESET
- **Characteristics:**
  - Computer name format: [First Name]PC
  - Shared properties: Disk volume (e0b2a963), performance counter frequency (100MHz), MAC address prefix (00:1B:21:13:37:xx)
  - Network: HTTP traffic blocked, DNS enabled

#### Class: something-PC
- **Templates:** 11 templates, 15 instances (e.g., WIN7-PC, ROGER-PC, DAVID-PC, etc.)
- **Operators:** Comodo, Kaspersky, Avira
- **Characteristics:**
  - Unique properties per template (different CPU, clock speed, MAC address, disk volume number)
  - IP addresses in consumer ISPs
  - Username typically matches the computer name, with some exceptions (e.g., ROGER-PC)

#### Class: C-TT
- **Templates:** 2 templates (C02TT, C06TT)
- **Instances:** 5 (C02TT22, C02TT26, C02TT36, C02TT18, C06TT43)
- **Operator:** Avira
- **Characteristics:**
  - Fixed properties, virtualized environment indicators

#### Class: ZGXTIQTG8837952
- **Template:** 1 template, 4 instances
- **Operator:** Comodo
- **Characteristics:**
  - Observed behind TOR in one instance

#### Class: spurtive
- **Templates:** 2 templates ("spurtive", "circumstellar")
- **Instances:** 1 each
- **Operator:** Comodo

#### Other Classes
- **One-template, one-instance classes:** ABC-WIN7, PC, WIN-U9ELNVPPAD0, PC-4A095E27CB, WIN-LRG949QLD21
- **Characteristics:**
  - Limited information due to infrequent encounters

### Observations on Sandbox Identity
- **Identity Concealment:** Minimal effort is made to hide the identity of the sandboxes.
- **Fixed Properties:** Names are often fixed, and disk volume serial numbers remain unchanged.
- **Virtualization Indicators:** MAC addresses and performance counters often indicate a virtualized environment.
- **Shared Templates:** Some sandbox templates (e.g., ROGER-PC) are shared or OEMed between multiple vendors.

### Additional Observations
- **Reaction Time:** Varies from minutes to hours.
- **Environment Access:** Some sandboxes prevent processes from accessing environment variables.
- **Delayed Executions:** Additional executions may occur days or weeks after sample submission.
- **Static Scanning:** Some AV products extract and execute embedded executables (Satellites).

### On-Premise AV Sandboxes
- **Configuration:** Some AV vendors offer on-premise sandboxes that allow outbound Internet traffic.
- **Impact:** The impact depends on the enterprise network configuration.
- **Recommendation:** Enterprises should be aware of this potential attack vector.

### Cloud-Based Analysis Services
- **Services Tested:**
  - **Google VirusTotal:** Leaked via multiple sandbox templates (e.g., ROGER-PC, ANTONY-PC, etc.)
  - **Joe Security’s Joe Sandbox Cloud:** Leaked via a single sandbox (DNS only).
  - **Payload Security’s Hybrid Analysis:** Leaked via a single sandbox (HTTP and DNS).

### Vendor Status
- **Cloud AV Sandboxes:**
  - **Avira:** Fixed on May 2nd.
  - **ESET:** Fixed on May 15th or before.
  - **Comodo:** Fixed on May 26th.
  - **Kaspersky:** Provided a private fix on July 14th.

- **Cloud-Based Analysis Services:**
  - **VirusTotal:** Declined to fix, stating intentional internet access for C2 communication.
  - **Joe Security:** Fixed on June 19th.
  - **Payload Security:** Chose not to comment.

### Improving AV Cloud Sandboxes
- **Prevention:** Block AV sandboxes from accessing the Internet, especially for samples not originating from the internet.
- **On-Premise Sandboxes:** Apply similar restrictions to on-premise sandboxes.

### Future Research
- **Additional Triggers:** Test with different packers, malware C&C, etc.
- **Exfiltration Techniques:** Explore other methods like ping (ICMP), HTTPS, SMTP, IRC, etc.
- **Stealth Improvement:** Compress/encrypt the Satellite image inside the Rocket.
- **Robust Alternatives:** Reverse-engineer the protocol between the AV agent and the cloud or management server.

### Conclusions
- **Data Exfiltration:** Cloud-based AV sandbox execution can be used to exfiltrate data from endpoint machines.
- **High-Security Environments:** Even high-security enterprises can be vulnerable if they share suspicious/malicious samples with the outside world.
- **Generalization:** Sharing an executable from the organization with the outside world can result in data exfiltration unless there is confidence that the sample has not changed since its arrival.
