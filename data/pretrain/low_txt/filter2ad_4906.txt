We are pleased to present the proceedings of HotDep’11, the seventh installment of the HotDep workshop series. The primary objectives of HotDep are to showcase cutting-edge research ideas across various domains of dependable systems and to foster connections between two key communities with a shared interest in dependability research: researchers who attend traditional dependability conferences such as DSN and ISSRE, and those who participate in mainstream systems conferences like SOSP, OSDI, and EuroSys.

To achieve these goals, the workshop alternates annually between a dependability conference in odd years and a systems conference in even years. This year, we have continued the tradition of previous meetings by selecting a program committee that includes a balanced mix of researchers from both communities:

- Lorenzo Alvisi, University of Texas at Austin
- Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau, University of Wisconsin, Madison
- Byung-Gon Chun, Intel Labs Berkeley
- Arun Iyengar, IBM Research
- Mohamed Kaaniche, LAAS-CNRS
- Daniel Mossé, University of Pittsburgh
- Priya Narasimhan, Intel Labs/Carnegie Mellon University
- James Plank, University of Tennessee
- André Schiper, EPFL
- Alexander Shraer, Yahoo! Research
- Atul Singh, NEC Labs, Princeton
- Marco Vieira, University of Coimbra
- Lidong Zhou, Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing

HotDep’11 received twenty submissions, a number consistent with previous years. The topics covered a wide range, including traditional fault tolerance at the hardware level, software reliability, intrusion detection and tolerance, and general dependability in networks and storage. Each submission was reviewed by at least three members of the program committee and thoroughly discussed during the virtual meeting held on April 11, 2011. The review process resulted in the acceptance of eleven papers for the main program. Additionally, six papers were selected for presentation as posters.

To maximize interactions among participants, we decided to include all eleven accepted papers in the poster session as well, allowing more time for in-depth discussions.

We would like to express our gratitude to several colleagues who contributed to the success of this program. First and foremost, we thank the authors for their valuable contributions and hope they find the program rewarding. We also extend our thanks to the program committee members for their high-quality reviews and their dedication during the discussions, especially those who attended the meeting despite the inconvenience of the time zone differences. We are grateful to the conference organizers, particularly Michael Lyu and the general workshop chairs, for their flexibility and support. Finally, we thank the steering committee of the workshop for giving us the opportunity to serve the community and organize this event.

This year’s program, along with those from previous years, is available online at [http://hotdep.org/](http://hotdep.org/).
