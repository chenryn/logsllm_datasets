### Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecards

#### Implementation Levels
1. **Advanced Implementation**
2. **Established Implementation**
3. **Intermediate Implementation**
4. **Early Implementation**

#### Elements and Descriptions

**First Responders' Utilization of Interoperability Solutions:**
- **Advanced Implementation:** First responders regularly and seamlessly utilize interoperability solutions. The region has demonstrated successful multi-agency communications during exercises, including state, federal, and support organizations.
- **Established Implementation:** First responders use interoperability solutions regularly and easily. The region has shown successful multi-agency communications (which may have included state, federal, and support organizations) during exercises.
- **Intermediate Implementation:** First responders use interoperability solutions regularly but face some challenges in achieving multi-agency communications during exercises.
- **Early Implementation:** Interoperable communications solutions are rarely used for multi-agency communication, and significant difficulties were encountered in achieving interoperability during exercises.

**Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):**
- **Advanced Implementation:** Regional SOPs, reviewed through the TICP process, are in place and regularly used by all agencies. NIMS procedures are well established among all agencies and disciplines, and all procedures were effectively utilized during exercises.
- **Established Implementation:** Existing regional SOPs were reviewed and included in the TICP and are in use by all agencies. NIMS-compliant command and control has been instituted by all agencies and disciplines in the region. Despite minor issues, all SOPs were successfully demonstrated during exercises.
- **Intermediate Implementation:** Some existing SOPs were incorporated into the TICP, and steps have been taken to institute these interoperability procedures among included agencies. Formal NIMS/ICS procedures are in place, but understanding varies among agencies, leading to some issues during exercises.
- **Early Implementation:** Region-wide SOPs were developed and formalized for the first time through the TICP but have not been disseminated to all included agencies. Some elements of NIMS/ICS procedures for command and control are in place, but understanding varies among agencies and was an area of difficulty during exercises.

**Governance:**
- **Advanced Implementation:** Decision-making bodies proactively expand membership to ensure representation from broader public support disciplines and other levels of government, while updating their agreements and strategic plans on a regular basis.
- **Established Implementation:** Formal agreements outline the roles and responsibilities of a decision-making group, which has an agreed-upon strategic plan that addresses sustainable funding for collective, regional interoperable communications needs.
- **Intermediate Implementation:** Some formal agreements exist, and informal agreements are in practice among members of a decision-making group. Regional strategic and budget planning processes are beginning to be put in place.
- **Early Implementation:** Decision-making groups are informal and do not yet have a strategic plan in place to guide collective communications interoperability goals and funding.

### Summary and Recommendations

**Birmingham (Alabama)**
- **Governance:** Intermediate Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures:** Established Implementation
- **Usage:** Advanced Implementation

**Governance:**
- Birmingham has developed a fairly robust governance structure for supporting communications interoperability, with multiple governing bodies responsible for creating and implementing the TICP. However, roles and responsibilities among these bodies are undefined, causing confusion. Further regional cooperation is needed to ensure locally driven decision-making and complete participation from agencies in the area.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Clarify the decision-making authority and implementation responsibilities of the governing bodies through a formalized charter.
  - Implement newly developed regional interoperability agreements and review them at least every 3 to 5 years.
  - Distribute a unified regional strategic plan, including Jefferson County, with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance.
  - Align local and statewide strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met.
  - Consider the direct involvement of an executive-level local official with political and fiscal authority to focus on interoperable communications.

**Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):**
- Birmingham successfully incorporated and updated existing policies and procedures into the submitted TICP. However, the area is developing multiple TICPs (one for each county), which could complicate achieving interoperable communications.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Distribute unified regional interoperability SOPs once completed and put them into practice with all first responders through regular training, exercises, and usage.
  - Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs to ensure all participating first responder agencies attain and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance.

**Usage:**
- Birmingham reports daily use of available means of interoperable communications and was effective in establishing interoperable communications during its exercise.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.

**Technology Overview:**
- The Birmingham area has five shared radio systems supporting public safety operations, including 800 MHz M/A-COM, Enhanced Digital Access Communications System, and Motorola SmartZone™ systems. The area also relies on the SouthernLINC commercial wireless system for voice and data wireless communications.

**Anchorage (Alaska)**
- **Governance:** Established Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures:** Established Implementation
- **Usage:** Advanced Implementation

**Governance:**
- Anchorage’s Interoperable Communications Steering Committee (ICSC) makes decisions related to funding, policy, training, exercises, and compliance. The ICSC has broad representation but may require greater federal representation.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Investigate the possibility of more formal involvement of state and federal organizations in the decision-making group.
  - Document and formalize agreements among all participating agencies to support partnerships on regional interoperability.
  - Establish a process to review the strategic plan annually to ensure that interoperable communications goals are met.
  - Align local and statewide strategic planning efforts to ensure regional interoperability needs are met.
  - Continue to support and enhance the regional interoperability funding strategy, including additional long-term funding sources.

**Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):**
- Anchorage built on existing TriBorough Regional Mutual Aid agreements but has yet to disseminate new regional SOPs to all included organizations.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Ensure all regional interoperability SOPs are incorporated into the TICP and distributed to participating agencies.
  - Regularly practice SOPs to increase proficiency in implementation.
  - Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs to ensure all participating first responder agencies attain and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance.

**Usage:**
- Public safety agencies in Anchorage have demonstrated a clear dedication to implementing interoperable communications solutions and a familiarity with the area’s current technology.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.

**Technology Overview:**
- The State of Alaska designed a statewide very high frequency, Project 25 (P25), trunked radio communications system several years ago in cooperation with the Department of Defense (DoD). This system, known as the ALMR system, is being built slowly as funding becomes available and includes local, state, federal, and DoD users. The Municipality of Anchorage is proceeding with its own development and installation of an 800 MHz, P25, trunked system.
