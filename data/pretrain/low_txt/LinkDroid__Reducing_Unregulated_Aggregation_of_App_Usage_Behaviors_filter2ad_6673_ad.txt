### Introduction to LinkDroid and its Functionality

To manage or terminate communication channels, this app requests certain permissions. For specific types of identifying information, such as Accounts and Location, we provide more granular control. For Location, users can choose between zip-code level (1km) or city-level (10km) precision. For Accounts, users can select which specific account to share instead of exposing all their accounts.

### Global Linking Ratio (GLR) Analysis

The Global Linking Ratio (GLR) is a metric that measures the extent to which different apps can be linked. Figures 13 and 14 illustrate the GLR for various categories of sources and individual users before and after applying LinkDroid.

- **Figure 13**: The GLR of different categories of sources before and after using LinkDroid.
- **Figure 14**: The GLR of different users before and after using LinkDroid.

After applying LinkDroid, the GLR dropped from 81% to 21%. This significant reduction indicates that fewer apps are linkable, and it becomes harder for an adversary to aggregate information from two linkable apps. The Global Linking Effort (GLE) also increased significantly, from 0.22 to 0.68. Specifically, the percentage of apps directly linkable to Facebook dropped from 86% to 18%.

### Effectiveness Across Users

The effectiveness of LinkDroid varies among users, as shown in Figure 14. Generally, LinkDroid is more effective for users with diverse mobility patterns, those who are cautious about sharing information across apps, and those who maintain different accounts for different services.

### Network Obfuscation and Overhead

LinkDroid uses a Virtual Private Network (VPN) as a plug-in solution to obfuscate network identifiers. While using a VPN, there is a potential increase in device energy consumption and network latency. Our tests on a Samsung Galaxy 4 device using Monsoon Power Monitor showed a 5% increase in energy consumption for online videos and no observable difference for browsing. The ping time to Alexa Top 20 domains increased by 13% (17ms). These results indicate that the overhead of using a VPN on a smartphone is noticeable but not significant. Seven out of 13 participants in our evaluation were willing to use a VPN to achieve better privacy.

### User Feedback and Acceptance

We interviewed 13 participants after the experiments. On a scale of 1 to 5, a score of 4 or higher was considered "agree." Eleven participants found the UI prompt informative and clear, and nine were willing to use LinkDroid daily to inform them about risks and provide opt-out options. However, these responses may not be representative due to the limited size and diversity of the participants. Users were particularly concerned about the linkability of sensitive apps like Snapchat and Facebook. Some participants explicitly stated that they do not want any app to be associated with Facebook, except for very necessary occasions. This supports the rationale behind LinkDroid's unlinkable mode.

### Related Work

Several proposals [7, 17] address the privacy threats of information aggregation by mobile apps. These shift the responsibility of information personalization and aggregation from mobile apps to the mobile OS or trusted cloud providers, requiring re-development of mobile apps and extensive modifications to the entire mobile ecosystem. In contrast, LinkDroid is a client-side solution compatible with the existing ecosystem, focusing on characterizing the threat in the current mobile ecosystem and making practical trade-offs.

Existing studies have investigated linkability under domain-specific scenarios. Arvind et al. [19] showed that a user’s profile in Netflix can be effectively linked to their IMDB profile using long-tailed (unpopular) movies. Sebastian et al. [16] described how to link profiles of the same user in different social networks using friends' topologies. Unlike these, LinkDroid focuses on domain-independent and ubiquitous linkability across all apps.

The capability of advertising agencies to conduct profiling and aggregation has been extensively studied [12, 23]. Various countermeasures, such as enforcing finer-grained isolation between ad libraries and apps [21, 22], or adopting a privacy-preserving advertising paradigm [4], have been proposed. However, these solutions only consider a very specific and restricted scenario, whereas LinkDroid introduces a general linkability model suitable for a diverse set of adversaries.

### Discussion

In this paper, we proposed a new metric, linkability, to quantify the ability of different apps to link and aggregate their usage behaviors. This metric, while useful, is only a coarse upper-bound of the actual privacy threat, especially in the case of IPCs. Communication between two apps does not necessarily mean they have conducted, or are capable of conducting, information aggregation. Deciding on the actual intention of each IPC is a challenging research problem.

LinkDroid aims to reduce covert linkability without the user’s consent or knowledge. It cannot and does not try to eliminate explicit linkability introduced by users. For example, a user may post photos of themselves or exhibit identifiable purchasing behavior in two different apps, establishing linkability. This type of linkability is app-specific, domain-dependent, and beyond the control of LinkDroid.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we addressed the privacy threat of unregulated aggregation by monitoring, characterizing, and reducing the underlying linkability across apps. This allows us to measure the potential threat of unregulated aggregation during runtime and promptly warn users of the associated risks. We observed how real-world apps abuse OS-level information and IPCs to establish linkability and proposed a practical countermeasure, LinkDroid. Our evaluation on real users has shown that LinkDroid is effective in reducing the linkability across apps and incurs only marginal overheads.
