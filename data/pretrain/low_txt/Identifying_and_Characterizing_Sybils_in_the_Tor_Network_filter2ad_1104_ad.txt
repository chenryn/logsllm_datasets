### Sybil Groups and Their Characteristics

#### Overview
This section provides a detailed analysis of various Sybil groups discovered by sybilhunter and our exitmap modules. These groups, marked with specific symbols, were involved in different types of attacks and activities within the Tor network.

#### Specific Sybil Groups

1. **Onion Domain Impersonation (Uptim e, Churn)**
   - **Description**: Multiple instances of replacing onion domains with impersonation sites.
   - **Activities**:
     - Replaced onion domains with impersonation sites.
     - Redirected users to impersonated sites.
   - **Botnet Information**:
     - **Mar 2014**: Default botnet, likely part of a Windows-powered botnet with wide geographical distribution.
     - **Oct 2010**: Trotsky botnet, consisting of relays running on Windows, primarily located in Eastern Europe.
     - **Jan 2016**: CloudVPS, hosted by a Dutch hoster, with relays in two /24 networks.
     - **Nov 2015**: DenkoNet, active in July 2015, hosted by cloudvps.
     - **Dec 2014**: Anonpoke, hosted by FuslVZTOR, with 61 relays.
     - **Jul 2015**: LizardNSA, hosted in the Google Cloud, with 4,615 relays.
     - **May 2015**: Fingerprints, with 168 relays.
     - **Mar 2014**: FDCservers, with 264 relays.
     - **Feb 2013**: AmazonEC2, with 1,424 relays.
     - **Jun 2010**: PlanetLab, with 595 relays.

2. **Trotsky Botnet**
   - **Description**: Part of a botnet, with relays gradually appearing and all running on Windows.
   - **Geographical Distribution**: Primarily in Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
   - **Configuration**: Running Tor version 0.2.1.26, listening on port 443, and mostly configured as exits.
   - **Timeline**:
     - First appeared in September 2010.
     - Peaks in relay numbers: 139 (September 23) and 219 (October 3).
     - Only 1-3 relays remained in the consensus after the peaks.

3. **Amazon EC2 Sybils**
   - **Description**: Relays using randomly-generated nicknames, running Tor version 0.2.2.37 on GNU/Linux.
   - **Behavior**: Each of the 88 IP addresses changed its fingerprint 24 times, systematically, in a small range.
   - **Online Duration**: 48 hours, with most relays obtaining the HSDir flag after 24 hours.
   - **Research Context**: Likely run by Biryukov, Pustogarov, and Weinmann for their 2013 paper "Trawling for Tor Hidden Services."

4. **Anonpoke Sybils**
   - **Description**: All relays shared the nickname "Anonpoke" and were online for four hours until rejected.
   - **Hosted By**: Rackspace VPS provider in the U.S., with one exception in the UK.
   - **Configuration**: Advertized default bandwidth of 1 GiB/s on ports 9001 and 9030, configured as middle relays and directory mirrors.

5. **FDCservers Sybils**
   - **Description**: Used for deanonymizing onion service users, as discussed by The Tor Project in a July 2014 blog post.
   - **Configuration**: Running FreeBSD, Tor version 0.2.4.18-rc, with identical flags and mostly identical bandwidth values.
   - **Timeline**: Added to the network in batches starting October 2013, with 123 IP addresses blocked by The Tor Project on July 8, 2014.

6. **Default Sybils**
   - **Description**: Named after the shared nickname "default," consisting of Windows-powered relays.
   - **Geographical Distribution**: Present in 73 countries, with Germany, Russia, and Austria being the top three.
   - **Behavior**: High IP address churn, little uptime, and diurnal patterns, suggesting regular power-off periods.
   - **Timeline**: Active since September 2011.

7. **PlanetLab Sybils**
   - **Description**: Relays using variations of the strings "planet", "plab", "pl", and "planetlab" as nicknames.
   - **Configuration**: Exit policy allowed ports 6660-6667, but did not get the Exit flag.
   - **Duration**: Online for three days before being removed by The Tor Project.
   - **Research Context**: Run by a researcher to learn about cloud computing and scaling effects.

8. **LizardNSA Sybils**
   - **Description**: Hosted in the Google Cloud, only online for ten hours.
   - **Configuration**: Mostly middle relays (96%), with some exit relays (4%).
   - **Behavior**: Set up to be onion service directories but taken offline before earning the HSDir flag.
   - **Impact**: If all relays had obtained the HSDir flag, they would have constituted almost 50% of all onion service directories.
   - **Claim of Responsibility**: Someone claimed responsibility on the tor-talk mailing list, indicating it was mere mischief.

9. **FuslVZTOR Sybils**
   - **Description**: Middle relays hosted in the netblock 212.38.181.0/24, owned by a UK VPS provider.
   - **Behavior**: Directory authorities started rejecting the relays five hours after they joined the network.
   - **Configuration**: Advertized default bandwidth of 1 GiB/s and used randomly determined ports.
   - **Parallel Activity**: Active during the "LizardNSA" attack, but no evidence of a connection.

### Alerts and Methodology

#### Alert Thresholds
To manage the number of alerts, we set conservative thresholds:
- **Network Churn**: Î±n for relays with the Valid flag set to 0.017.
- **Fingerprint Changes**: Raised an alert if a relay changed its fingerprint at least ten times per month.
- **Uptime Visualization**: Raised an alert if at least five relays exhibited an identical uptime sequence.

#### Churn Rate Analysis
We analyzed the churn rate between two subsequent consensuses for all 72,061 consensuses published between October 2007 and January 2016. The churn rate slowly reduced over the years, leading us to focus on 2015 and 2016 for more representative results.

### Conclusion
The analysis of these Sybil groups provides insights into the various tactics and motivations behind such attacks. Understanding these patterns and behaviors is crucial for enhancing the security and integrity of the Tor network.
