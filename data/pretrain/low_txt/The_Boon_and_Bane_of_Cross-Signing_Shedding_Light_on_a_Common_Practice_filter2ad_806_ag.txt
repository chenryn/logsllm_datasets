### 2009 AffirmTrust Networking Cross-Sign Revocation
In 2009, the cross-signs for AffirmTrust Networking were revoked more than a year later due to a double-use of the serial number [17]. In contrast, the AffirmTrust Commercial cross-sign was revoked only a few months before its expiration in 2019. However, the corresponding root certificates remain trusted.

### B.5.2 Digicert Details
In Section 5.6.2, we outlined that Digicert inherited most of its cross-signs through acquisitions. The following section provides detailed information on these cross-signs.

Within the Digicert group, most XS-Certs (cross-signed certificates) were created before the corresponding CAs (Certificate Authorities) were acquired by Digicert. As a result, we predominantly find cross-signs between certificates of the same subsidiary, with very few cross-signs across different Digicert subsidiaries, as illustrated in Figure 5. Most cross-signs originate from the periods when VeriSign, Verizon, and QuoVadis were in control, with Digicert adding only a few cross-signs among its own roots.

#### VeriSign Cross-Signs
VeriSign cross-signed four of its own roots: 
- VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority - G3
- G4
- G5
- VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority

It also cross-signed thawte Primary Root CA. Similarly, GeoTrust Primary Certification Authority, which originated from Equifax's security business, was cross-signed during VeriSign's ownership. Only GeoTrust Global CA was already cross-signed when it was still owned by Equifax. After acquiring VeriSign as part of Symantec in 2017, Digicert used its control over VeriSign roots to cross-sign DigiCert Global Root G2 with VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority - G5. Otherwise, it retained the existing cross-signs.

We also find an external cross-sign created by VeriSign that did not last until the ownership change to Symantec. When Thawte was owned by VeriSign, Thawte Server cross-signed Entrust.net Secure Server Certificate Authority. After the intermediates expired in 2003, Thawte did not renew the cross-sign. However, Entrust obtained a cross-sign from the Digicert-controlled GTE CyberTrust Global Root in 2004.

#### Intermediate XS-Certs
Most intermediate XS-Certs in the Digicert group were created by VeriSign or Symantec before Digicert acquired them. Specifically, VeriSign created four intermediate XS-Certs for Thawte and three for itself. After acquiring VeriSign, Symantec, which did not cross-sign any of its roots, created three intermediate XS-Certs for its own CA name. Only one additional Symantec intermediate XS-Cert was created by Digicert after the acquisition. Two to three months after the cross-signing (or acquisition), Digicert revoked all certificates of this latter XS-Cert but kept the old intermediate XS-Certs active.

A cross-sign of QuoVadis, which existed before it was acquired by WiSeKey in 2017, survived as an isolated island within the Digicert group.

#### Beyond Limited Cross-Signing
Beyond these limited cross-signs, Verizon had numerous internal and external cross-signs, which became part of the Digicert group when it acquired the Verizon and CyberTrust roots. Internally, Verizon established multiple cross-signs across CyberTrust roots and a Verizon root cross-sign (cf. Figure 5). Digicert used Baltimore CyberTrust Root to cross-sign DigiCert Global Root CA and DigiCert High Assurance EV Root CA. The latter was additionally cross-signed by GTE CyberTrust Global Root and DigiCert Transition RSA Root (and Entrust.net Secure Server Certification Authority; cf. Section 5.6.1).

More prevalent are the cross-signs of external organizations. First, Verizon started cross-signing root certificates of WellsFargo since 2013. Specifically, the Baltimore CyberTrust Root cross-signed WellsFargo’s WellsSecure Public Root Certificate Authority and WellsSecure Public Root Certification Authority 01 G2 in 2013 and 2015, respectively. The latter was already cross-signed by Verizon Global Root CA in 2013. All corresponding intermediates were revoked by the CA’s CRL and Mozilla’s OneCRL in 2017, when the roots were removed from almost all root stores (after a request by WellsFargo [15]), except for Apple’s store, which still includes WellsSecure Public Root Certificate Authority.

Similarly, the Verizon-controlled GTE CyberTrust Global Root cross-signed Certipost E-Trust Primary Normalized CA, providing it with broad trust coverage and creating another cross-sign that survived the acquisition by Digicert.

Verizon also cross-signed several state-controlled CAs, which is potentially problematic (cf. Section 5.2). In 2010 and 2013, Baltimore CyberTrust Root cross-signed the Swiss Government root, increasing its formerly limited trust (Apple and Microsoft only). One of the cross-signs expired in 2014, while the other stayed active until after the Digicert acquisition. In 2013, Belgium Root CA2 replaced a cross-sign by (non-Digicert) GlobalSign Root from 2007 with a further Verizon cross-sign by CyberTrust Global Root. This cross-sign also stayed active after the Digicert acquisition until October 2017 when it was revoked in OneCRL [19].

Verizon used GTE CyberTrust Global Root and Baltimore CyberTrust Root to cross-sign Portugal’s SCEE ECRaizEstado (formerly trusted by Microsoft only). Shortly after obtaining control over the CyberTrust roots, Digicert actively repeated the latter cross-sign. However, when the cross-sign by GTE CyberTrust Global Root expired in August 2018, the other cross-signs were revoked due to a series of misissuances [21]. Overall, several independent CAs provided state-controlled CAs with larger trust coverage than their original root certificates.

Finally, we find only a single cross-sign between Digicert’s own roots, i.e., DigiCert Global Root CA cross-signed DigiCert Trusted Root G4.

### B.6 Entrust: Further Examples
Beyond Entrust's involvement in Digicert cross-signs (cf. Section B.5.2), Entrust.net Secure Server CA also cross-signed Trustwave’s Secure Trust CA and the TDC Internet Root of the Danish ISP TDC in 2006.

Furthermore, Entrust Root Certification Authority and Entrust Root Certification Authority - G2 created the intermediate XS-Cert Entrust Certification Authority - L1M in 2014. The G2 root revoked the cross-sign after a month but replaced it with a new cross-sign. Also, the intermediate XS-Cert Entrust Certification Authority - L1B was cross-signed by Entrust.net Secure Server Certification Authority. When the cross-sign expired, the originally issuing Entrust.net Certification Authority (2048) revoked the original certificate, declaring it superseded.

Moreover, Entrust cross-signed its Entrust.net Secure Server Certification Authority and Entrust Certification Authority - L1K. These cross-signs only provide alternative paths.

### B.7 Cross-Signing in the Grid PKI
In the grid-PKI, we do not find a real XS-Cert, but an interesting reissuance. Originally, ESnet Root CA 1 issued an intermediate named NERSC Online CA. A month before its expiry, NERSC created a corresponding root certificate instead of requesting a new intermediate. One could argue that ESnet helped NERSC to bootstrap the trust in its later root.

### B.8 Miscellaneous XS-Certs
Finally, we list less prominent cross-signs.

#### B.8.1 Miscellaneous Internal Root XS-Certs
We find some more cross-signs of root certificates issued within a CA. Slovenia used its SI-TRUST Root to cross-sign its sigov-ca and sigend-ca. However, the corresponding root certificates are included only in Microsoft’s root store.

Several CAs used older certificates to sign new versions:
- GlobalSign used its older GlobalSign Root CA to cross-sign the new GlobalSign Root CA - R2 and GlobalSign Root CA - R3.
- Sonera Class2 CA cross-signed TeliaSonera Root CA v1.
- Chunghwa Telecom’s ePKI Root Certification Authority - G2 cross-signed the ePKI Root Certification Authority. Notably, ePKI Root Certification Authority - G2 is itself cross-signed, and the root is only included in recent Microsoft stores, whereas the cross-signed version is widely trusted.
- SECOM’s Security Communication EV RootCA1 and Security Communication RootCA2 were both cross-signed by Security Communication RootCA1.
- Certum CA cross-signed the newer Certum Trusted Network CA.
- DST Root CA X3, which also cross-signed the ISRG Roots used by Let’s Encrypt, cross-signed IdenTrust Commercial Root CA 1.
- Taiwan CA cross-signed its TWCA Global Root CA with the TWCA Root Certification Authority.
- Hellenic Academic and Research Institutions RootCA 2015 got cross-signed by Hellenic Academic and Research Institutions RootCA 2011.
- Deutsche Telekom used its established Deutsche Telekom Root CA 2 to cross-sign the T-TeleSec GlobalRoot Class 2 and T-TeleSec GlobalRoot Class 3 roots.
- TC TrustCenter Class 2 CA, which only got into Mozilla and Android root stores for a short time, was cross-signed by TC TrustCenter Class 2 CA II, which reached better root store coverage, although the trust does not hold up anymore. The same applies for TC TrustCenter Class 3 CA and its cross-signing of TC TrustCenter Class 3 CA II.

#### B.8.2 Miscellaneous Internal Intermediate XS-Certs
- Keynectis used its Certplus (Class 2 Primary CA) to issue the intermediate KEYNECTIS ICS ADVANCED Class 3 CA and cross-signed it with OpenTrust CA for AATL G1, likewise owned by a Keynectics subsidiary.
- Chunghwa Telecom created the intermediate XS-Cert Public Certification Authority - G2 using its roots ePKI Root Certification Authority and ePKI Root Certification Authority - G2.
- Dhimyotis created the intermediate XS-Certs Certigna Services CA and Certigna Wild CA, which provide trust paths to its Certigna root as well as the Certigna Root CA, which is only in the root stores of Mozilla and Microsoft yet.

#### B.8.3 Miscellaneous External Intermediate XS-Certs
Other less prominent intermediate XS-Certs include cross-signs issued across CAs:
- The Vodafone root issued the Vodafone (Secure Sites) intermediate in 2006. GTE CyberTrust Global Root cross-signed this intermediate from 2008 to 2015, providing trust paths after the expiry of the Vodafone root in 2011. Another cross-sign by Baltimore CyberTrust Root extended this trust to 2017, when it was revoked, or even until its expiry in December 2019 for clients that miss checking the CRL.
- The USERTrust Legacy Secure Server CA was signed by Entrust.net Certification Authority (2048) and Entrust.net Secure Server Certification Authority in 2009. Fourteen months before the expiry of those intermediates, AddTrust External CA Root issued a replacement.
- AAA Certificate Services was signed by Entrust.net Secure Server Certification Authority in 2006 and cross-signed by AddTrust External CA Root in 2008.

When GTE CyberTrust Global Root was owned by Verizon in 2007-09, it issued the intermediates Vodafone (Corporate Domain 2009), Vodafone (Secure Networks), MULTICERT - Entidade de Certificado 001, MULTICERT-CA 02, LuxTrust root CA, and Munich Re’s MRG Intermediate CA 01. In 2012 and 2013, it cross-signed these intermediates with Baltimore CyberTrust Root, offering validity up to 2025 instead of only 2018 as the older root. Several of the intermediates were later revoked:
- Both Vodafone certs were revoked in March 2017.
- OneCRL only listed the newer cross-signs as the older certificates were already distrusted by the removal of the Baltimore CyberTrust Root from Mozilla’s root store in 2015.
- The revocation of MULTICERT - Entidade de Certificado 001 in 2019 and the revocation of the LuxTrust root CA in 2017 did not affect the older certificate as it had already expired.

In 2015, Entrust issued and cross-signed the intermediate UIS-IntB using three different CA certificates, each widely trusted.

Finally, we found re-issuances performed by the same CA but a different CA certificate, which do not fall under our definition of cross-signs:
- In 2016, SHA-1 Federal Root CA G2 reissued the intermediate CertiPath Bridge CA, whose earlier version, issued by SHA-1 Federal Root CA, expired in 2014, thus not rendering this case a cross-sign.
- A similar case holds for SAS Public CA v1, which was issued by RSA Public Root CA v1 in 2007 and reissued two weeks after expiration using RSA Security 2048 V3.
