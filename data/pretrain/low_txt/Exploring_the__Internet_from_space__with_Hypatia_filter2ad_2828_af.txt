### A. Ground Station Relays

Hypatia easily accommodates experimentation with constellations that eschew inter-satellite connectivity. In this scenario, ground station relays provide "bent-pipe" connectivity, where long-distance communication goes up and down through satellites and ground stations (GSes) [31]. To demonstrate this capability, we simulate a long-lived TCP flow from Paris to Moscow over the first shell of Kuiper's K1 shell (Table 1). We compare the behavior of the flow in two scenarios:
- (a) The constellation model used in the rest of the paper, i.e., with one GS-satellite link followed by a series of ISLs, followed by a satellite-GS link.
- (b) Without any ISLs, using only bent-pipe connectivity through GS relays. For this case, we add a grid of ground stations between Paris and Moscow, allowing multiple relays to be chosen from.

**Figures 16(a) and 16(b)** show the situation at the start (𝑡 = 0) for the two scenarios. **Figure 18(c)** compares the path RTT over time for the two scenarios absent any traffic. As expected, the bent-pipe connectivity results in higher latency, typically by around 5 ms. **Figure 17** shows the paths at a different time (around 𝑡 = 159 s), near the "peak RTT" in Figure 18(c).

While a variety of configurations are possible for network devices, for this experiment, we configured the network devices at the satellites to have a fixed total up-bandwidth, and to use the same queue for all outgoing traffic. This implies that for the bent-pipe connection, an on-path satellite’s GSL uplink queue is shared by the TCP packets traveling in one direction (from a GS to the satellite) and the corresponding ACKs traveling in the opposite direction (from a different GS to the satellite). Our experiment shows the impact of this for a uni-directional TCP NewReno flow from Paris to Moscow. Both the estimated RTT in **Figure 18(b)** and the TCP congestion window in **Figure 19(b)** show the effect of the aforementioned sharing of the network device between the data packets and the ACKs. The throughput over the bent-pipe connection is also modestly lower for the same reason, as seen in **Figure 19(c)**.

We also see, from comparing **Figures 19(a) and 19(b)**, that at least in this instance, TCP behavior is markedly different for the bent-pipe connection, with many more fluctuations in the congestion window. The reason is that ISLs and bent-pipe connectivity engender different bottleneck behavior in this case. The bottleneck with ISLs is the outgoing network device from the first (source) GS. For the bent-pipe, due to the sharing of the path across data packets and ACKs, the bottleneck is the first satellite-to-ground link. As satellites in the path change, specifically the first satellite, the queue size at this satellite varies substantially over time. Reordering events that trigger TCP to interpret loss occur at 𝑡 = 52.9, 86.3, 92.5, 147.2, and 162.1 s, the precise points in **Figure 19(b)**, where the congestion window drops.

Note that this low-level behavior depends on how the network devices are configured, e.g., multiple separate queues for uplink traffic would change the behavior substantially. With cross-traffic, the ISL case may also exhibit similar behavior, with more frequent reordering as the bottleneck moves away from the first up-link device. We thus caution readers against drawing deeper conclusions on TCP behavioral differences in bent-pipe versus ISL connectivity from this small experiment; this experiment is merely meant to demonstrate Hypatia’s ability to support bent-pipe constellations.

**Figures 16, 17, 18, and 19** illustrate the following:
- **Figure 16**: Paris to Moscow connectivity over Kuiper at the start, 𝑡 = 0. Black dots represent satellites, yellow dots are candidate GS relays, and green dots represent endpoint GSes and chosen GS relays.
- **Figure 17**: Paris to Moscow connectivity over Kuiper at around 𝑡 = 159.
- **Figure 18**: RTT over time. In both cases, queuing delay at the low bandwidth of 10 Mbit/s inflates RTT far beyond the computed RTT in (c).
- **Figure 19**: TCP behaves differently for the ISL and bent-pipe cases, primarily due to different bottleneck behavior as the ACKs share the same bottleneck in our configuration for bent-pipe connectivity.
