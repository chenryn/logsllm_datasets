## 4. Approach C: Power-Law Decay in Per-Flow Packet Distributions

The per-flow packet distribution \( \Pr[X_j = i] \) can be inferred from the sampled per-flow packet distribution \( \Pr[Y_j = i] \). Approach C leverages the observation that the distribution of the number of per-flow packets for Internet traffic tends to decay in an approximately power-law fashion.

### 4.1. Empirical and Theoretical Distributions

In this section, we focus on Approach C and investigate how \( \Pr[X_j = i] \) affects the threshold \( \hat{y} \). We start by examining empirical distributions derived from packet traces measured in different networks. We then extend our analysis to a family of theoretical Pareto distributions. Surprisingly, we find that the calculated thresholds \( \hat{y} \) are similar for both empirical and theoretical distributions. This suggests that a threshold obtained for one network can serve as a reasonable approximation for other networks, provided their flow statistics also exhibit heavy-tail characteristics.

#### 4.1.1. Empirical Distributions

To complement the IPCL trace, we used two additional unidirectional packet traces of Internet traffic. The first trace, referred to as the IPKS trace, was measured at the same location as the IPCL trace but on different OC-48c backbone links between Indianapolis and Kansas City [9]. The second trace, called the CESCA trace, was measured at a Gigabit Ethernet link connecting the Anella Científica to the global Internet via RedIRIS [10]. Both traces had sufficient traffic volume during the measurement period.

Figure 3 shows the complementary cumulative distributions \( \Pr[X_j > k] \) for these three traces. Despite differences in their distributions, all three traces exhibit heavy-tail behaviors and decay in an approximately power-law fashion. Using \( \Pr[X_j = i] \) for each trace, we calculate the False Positive Rate (FPR) and False Negative Rate (FNR) for \( y' \) (see Figure 4), with \( N = 10^7 \), \( f \in \{10^{-3}, 10^{-4}\} \), and \( \hat{x} = 10^4 \). The FPR and FNR show similar tendencies across the three traces. Table 3 lists the calculated thresholds \( \hat{y} \) for identifying elephant flows in sampled packets. These thresholds are very similar for traces with different per-flow packet distributions.

#### 4.1.2. Theoretical Distributions

We use the Pareto distribution as a theoretical model because it is well-suited for evaluating behaviors where the complementary cumulative distribution decays in a power-law fashion. The Pareto distribution is defined by \( \Pr[X_j \leq x] = 1 - (\alpha/x)^\beta \) (for \( x \geq \alpha \)), where \( \alpha > 0 \) is a location parameter, and \( \beta > 0 \) is a shape parameter. The probability density function is \( \Pr[X_j = x] = \beta \alpha^\beta / x^{\beta+1} \). Figure 5 illustrates the complementary cumulative distribution of the Pareto distributions for \( \alpha \leq x \leq 10^5 \), with \( \alpha = 1.0 \) and \( \beta \in \{0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5\} \).

For each Pareto distribution, we calculate FPR and FNR using equations (3) and (4) (see Figure 6), and \( \hat{y} \) using equation (5) (see Table 4). Here, \( N = 10^7 \), \( f \in \{10^{-3}, 10^{-4}\} \), \( \hat{x} = 10^4 \), and \( \epsilon = 0.05 \). Both FPR and FNR show very similar tendencies for all distributions. The calculated thresholds \( \hat{y} \) are similar for the Pareto distributions over a wide range of \( \beta \), and are also similar to those for the empirical distributions.

As shown in Figure 5, the empirical distributions of \( X_j \) for the three traces roughly follow \( \Pr[X_j > x] \sim x^{-\beta} \), where \( \beta \) is close to 1. Other studies have reported similar characteristics in many different networks, including the Internet [5, 8, 12, 15, 16]. Therefore, we conclude that the value of \( \hat{y} \) calculated using the Pareto distribution (e.g., with \( \beta = 1.0 \)) can serve as a good approximation for a wide range of other networks, provided their per-flow packet statistics also follow heavy-tail distributions.

## 5. Conclusion

In this paper, we have described a method for identifying elephant flows through periodic sampling of packets. The key is to determine the threshold of per-flow packets in sampled packets that reliably indicates whether a flow is an elephant flow in unsampled packets. We have shown that such a threshold can be obtained using Bayes' theorem, with a proper trade-off between false positives and false negatives. Moreover, we have found that the calculated thresholds are quite similar for various a priori distributions, suggesting that a threshold obtained for one network can be applied to other networks with similar per-flow packet distributions. Although our current scheme focuses on identifying elephant flows rather than extracting detailed flow statistics, we believe that identifying elephant flows is a crucial step toward achieving the latter during network operation and traffic engineering.

The advantage of our approach lies in its simplicity. Periodic sampling and stateless flow identification without per-packet processing can be easily implemented on any contemporary high-end PC, making it a cost-effective solution. Additionally, our analytical framework quantifies the intrinsic trade-offs in flow identification and provides insights into choosing appropriate parameters. For ISPs operating large-scale networks with a variety of measurement equipment, these features are considered very important in practice.
