**Author: Gregory Akers**

## Abstract
As technology evolves toward an "Everything Connected" model, cybersecurity will become the primary concern for users when considering adoption. In this new era, the logical point of protection will be the communications infrastructure that forms the connected web. Consequently, Cisco Systems is investing in and driving innovation in network-based cybersecurity. The initial focus of this effort includes cryptography, data analytics and privacy, platform protection, and threat awareness.

This discussion will outline Cisco's current initiatives in advanced security research, including global engagements, future needs, and likely methodologies.
