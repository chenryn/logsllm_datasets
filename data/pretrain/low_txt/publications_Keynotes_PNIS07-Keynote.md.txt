#### Abstract
In today's highly competitive e-commerce and e-business markets, organizations strive to ensure that their business processes and workflows are simple, modular, easy to understand, maintain, and re-engineer. To achieve these goals, the calculation of quality metrics for processes is essential. These metrics provide critical feedback on the readability, understandability, effort, testability, reliability, and maintainability of processes.

In the field of software engineering, quality metrics have proven their significance in promoting good programming practices and software design. Designs guided by these metrics (e.g., coupling, cohesion, complexity, modularity, and size) tend to be less error-prone, easier to understand, maintain, and manage, and more efficient. Several researchers have identified parallels between software programs and business process designs, recognizing the potential of quality metrics in business process management.

This talk will delve into the importance of quality metrics in business process modeling. It will present a classification and an overview of current business process metrics and provide an example of their implementation using the ProM tool.
