In React 0.12.0, attempting to access `this.key` within a React component will return `undefined`. This can be demonstrated with a simple test case, available at [this JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/jg2pd4ob/2/).

In the previous version, 0.11.x, it was possible to access the key value via `this.props.key`. However, this functionality has been removed in the 0.12.0 release.
