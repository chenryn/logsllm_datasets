## Abstract
This panel highlights a selection of the most interesting and provocative papers from the 2005 New Security Paradigms Workshop (NSPW). The workshop was held in September 2005, and more information can be found at [URL]. The panel consists of authors of the selected papers, moderated by the workshop’s general chairs. We present papers focusing on major themes that emerged from the workshop, which are expected to provoke the most engaging discussions at ACSAC.

## 1. Panel Theme
This panel presents a selection of the best, most interesting, and most provocative work from the 2005 New Security Paradigms Workshop. For fourteen years, NSPW has provided a productive and highly interactive forum for innovative new approaches to computer security.

NSPW is an invitational workshop with a deliberately small size to facilitate deep, meaningful discussions of new ideas. Authors are encouraged to present work that might be considered risky in other settings. All participants are charged with providing constructive feedback. The resulting brainstorming environment has proven to be an excellent medium for advancing visionary ideas.

Our philosophy is to seek significantly new paradigms and shifts from previous thinking, and to facilitate debate within a constructive environment of experienced researchers and practitioners, as well as newer participants in the field. In keeping with the NSPW philosophy, this panel challenges many of the dominant paradigms in information security. Expect it to be highly interactive, with lively exchanges between the panelists and the audience. Come prepared with an open mind and ready to question and comment on what our panelists present!

## 2. Panel Format and Papers
The panel will consist of four authors of papers selected by the NSPW 2005 General and Program Chairs, and it will be chaired by the general chair. Below are abstracts of each paper selected for presentation:

### 2.1. Speculative Virtual Verification: Constrained Speculative Execution Policy
The ability for computing systems to autonomously detect and correct faults and vulnerabilities would greatly improve their stability and security. This paper advocates modifying general-purpose processors to provide implicit supervision, export a policy-driven monitoring mechanism, and provide the foundation for an automatic response capability via instruction stream rewriting.

We propose speculative virtual verification (SVV), a set of architectural components that speculatively execute the entire instruction stream. Similar to how a superscalar processor speculatively executes past a branch instruction and discards the mis-predicted code path, SVV operates on the instruction stream in two phases. The first phase executes instructions, optimistically speculating that the results are benign. The second phase makes the effects of the speculated instruction stream visible to the OS and application software layers and potentially rewrites the instruction stream if it is deemed harmful.

### 2.2. Visual Security Protocol Modeling
This paper argues that the existing model-driven architecture paradigm does not adequately cover the visual modeling of security protocols, which are sequences of interactions between principals. A visual security protocol modeling notation should be event-based, compositional, comprehensive, laconic, lucid, and well-defined.

Candidate visual modeling notations from the OMG’s Model Driven Architecture (MDA) fail to satisfy one or more of these criteria. Existing visual modeling formalisms outside the MDA also fall short. For example, Petri nets, statecharts, and labeled transition systems are not event-based, compositional, or laconic; Harel’s Live Sequence Charts are event-based, laconic, and compositional but not comprehensive.

The GSPML visual language for security protocols satisfies all of the criteria. The paper presents GSPML by example, using two security protocol models.

### 2.3. Authenticating With Our Minds
We present a novel idea for user authentication called pass-thoughts. Recent advances in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology indicate potential for a new type of human-computer interaction: a user transmitting thoughts directly to a computer. The goal of a pass-thought system is to extract as much entropy as possible from a user’s brain signals upon transmitting a thought. If brain signals can be recorded and processed accurately and repeatably, a pass-thought system might provide a quasi two-factor, changeable authentication method resistant to shoulder-surfing. The talk discusses the motivation and potential of pass-thought authentication and outlines the design of a currently feasible pass-thought system.

### 2.4. Internet Instability and Disturbance: Goal or Menace?
Self-replicating code, such as viruses and worms, has become an unfortunate part of today’s online environment. These threats can spread rapidly, causing systemic outages and threatening the overall stability of the Internet. Most exploits leveraged by worms are well-known and easily solvable if best security practices are followed. Actions driving tighter security can have a positive long-term impact on the overall stability of the global network.

In this session, we take the unusual position that low-level virus and worm outbreaks are highly beneficial to the overall goal of preventing catastrophic Internet failure. We draw from a biological analogy, the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis, which argues that disruption drives diversity, stability, and resilience in natural systems. We conclude that the deliberate release of non-threatening viruses and worms may be a necessary approach to protect the Internet from catastrophic outbreaks. This position is supported by empirical evidence from the computer world and further comparison with biological systems.
