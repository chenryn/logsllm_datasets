### State Information Storage and Service Instance Location
State information is stored within resources. When the corresponding resource is identified, a service instance can be located. In ES1, the identifier of an instance and its associated private key are stored within a resource, and the instance identifier is identical to the resource identifier.

### 4.1 Worst Case Evaluation
We have deployed the experimental systems on both a single computer and a distributed system with multiple computers. Specifically, we deploy the experimental systems on a single computer for two reasons:

- **Precise Overhead Evaluation:** To accurately evaluate the overhead introduced by authentication protocols (e.g., generating key pairs, generating MACs for messages), we need to eliminate the influence of message transport time.
- **Sequential Execution Environment:** Deploying the experimental systems on a single computer allows us to assess their performance in the strictest environment, where all operations are executed sequentially. All experiments in this section are conducted on a single computer unless otherwise specified.

#### Experiment: Single Computer Deployment
In the experiment illustrated in Figure 6, over 24,000 instances are generated and introduced to the Session Authority. Initially, the time consumption for generating and registering new session partners is proportional to the number of newly generated instances. The system remains stable until around 16,000 instances are generated. After that, performance decreases, and the system eventually stops due to memory limitations.

**Comparison with ES2**
- ES1 simulates distributed applications using a multi-party authentication system, while ES2 simulates distributed applications without such a system. The results from ES2 serve as benchmarks. By comparing the results from both systems, we can assess the overheads imposed by our authentication system.

#### Experiments with Message-Level Security Protocols
We also combined ES1 and ES2 with two message-level security protocols, Secure Conversation and Secure Message, provided by GT4. In the experiment shown in Figure 7, the secure conversation protocol was used to generate signatures for every message transported in ES1. The time consumption of the experimental system starts to increase non-linearly after over 720 instances are generated. A similar phenomenon occurs in ES2 after over 1,040 instances are generated when ES2 is deployed with the secure conversation protocol.

  - 1,530

As illustrated in Figures 7 and 8, the time consumption of ES1 is about twice that of ES2, even though ES1 provides sufficient support for session authentication operations. These results indicate that the scalability of the experimental systems is significantly affected by the security protocols combined with them.

#### Large-Scale CROWN Grid Experiments
To avoid generating GT4-oriented results only, we implemented our design in the large-scale CROWN Grid (China Research and Development environment Over Wide-area Network). CROWN is a practical grid system aimed at promoting the utilization of valuable resources and cooperation among researchers worldwide. The experimental results are presented in Figure 9. The time consumption of ES1 is about twice that of ES2, similar to the GT4-based experiments. However, since the computer used by CROWN is much more powerful, the performance of our experimental systems is significantly better. The systems can remain stable until over 260,000 instances are generated.

### 4.2 Distributed Deployment
The performance of the experimental systems improves significantly when deployed in a distributed environment with multiple computers. In the GT4-based experiments, the time consumption of ES1 without additional security protocols increases linearly until over 70,000 new instances are generated. When the secure conversation protocol is incorporated, ES1 executes stably until over 3,000 instances are generated. As an example of distributed deployment, the experimental results based on CROWN are presented in Figure 10. The time consumption of ES1 is proportional to the number of newly generated instances until over 300,000 instances are generated.
