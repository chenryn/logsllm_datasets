- **Western Digital TV (Live Hub)**
  - **Inside:**
    - Motivation to access additional TV stations
    - Offline Analysis:
      - WDTVPriv partition
      - Hauppauge TV app storage
      - Spotify offline storage
      - Last update package
      - WDTVLiveHub main media
      - Swap partition

### Offline Analysis
- **Updates:**
  - Update contents
  - Firmware signatures
  - Image I and Image II
  - MD5 checksums and end signatures

#### Example of Binwalk Output
```bash
felix@xxx:$ binwalk wdtvlivehub.bin
DECIMAL         HEX             DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```

### Vulnerability Finding
- **SQL Injection:**
  - Exploiting SQL injection to create a backdoor.
  - Example payload: `0"; ATTACH DATABASE 'lol.php' AS lol; CREATE TABLE lol.pwn (dataz text); INSERT INTO lol.pwn (dataz) VALUES ('';--`
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):**
  - Identifying where to place a PHP shell.

### File System Investigation
- **SMB Share:**
  - `/tmp/media/usb/Local/WDTVLiveHub/` is the root of the SMB share.
  - User videos are stored in `/tmp/media/usb/Local/WDTVLiveHub/Videos/`.

### Web Server and Low-Hanging Fruits
- **Web Server Running as Root:**
  - Potential security risk.
- **Directory Listing:**
  - Files and directories in `/opt/webserver/htdocs` include system_password.php, test.php, tmp, user, wd_nas, wdtvlivehub, and whatson.

### Hardware Hacking
- **Interesting Pins:**
  - Booting up and identifying interesting hardware pins.
- **Boot Process:**
  - Password set by `gbus_read_serial_num` located in `/usr/local/sbin`.
  - AES key retrieval from ROM during boot.

### Debugging Dmaosd
- **GDBServer on Device:**
  - Compiling GDBServer for MIPS architecture.
  - Copying GDBServer executable to the device.
- **IDA Pro for Remote Debugging:**
  - Using IDA Pro or MIPS gdb for remote debugging.
  - Tips for effective debugging.

### Adding Custom Services
- **Browser Patching:**
  - Using QT embedded browser and runtime patching to modify URLs.
  - Techniques for process manipulation on Windows and Linux.

### Supported Codecs
- **Codec Compatibility:**
  - Ensuring that the TV station codec is supported.
  - List of supported MIME types and codecs.

### Persistence and Firmware Patching
- **Read-Only File Systems:**
  - All persistent file systems are read-only from ROM.
  - Dynamic parts are copied to /tmp.
- **Patch Strategy:**
  - Conservative firmware patching to avoid bricking.
  - Clean reset scheme and placing tools on the hard drive for easy removal.

### Legal and Security Considerations
- **GPL Firmware:**
  - Availability and potential loss of DRM and WD keys.
- **Security:**
  - Conspiracy theories about Western Digital leaving the device open.
- **Outlook:**
  - Current situation and future options.
