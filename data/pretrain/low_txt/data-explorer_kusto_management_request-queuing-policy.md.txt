# Request Queuing Policy (Preview)

The request queuing policy for a workload group manages the queuing of requests for delayed execution when the number of concurrent requests exceeds a specified threshold. This policy helps reduce the number of throttling errors during peak activity by temporarily queuing incoming requests and periodically checking for available capacity.

## Key Features

- **Threshold-Based Queuing**: Requests are queued once the maximum number of concurrent requests is exceeded.
- **Short Time Period**: Incoming requests are queued for a predefined short duration, during which the system polls for available capacity.
- **Dependency on Request Rate Limit Policy**: The request queuing policy can only be defined for workload groups that have a [request rate limit policy](request-rate-limit-policy.md) in place, which limits the maximum number of concurrent requests at the scope of the workload group.

## Enabling the Policy

To enable the request queuing policy, use the [.alter-merge workload group](alter-merge-workload-group-command.md#alter-the-request-queuing-policy) management command.

## Policy Object

The request queuing policy includes a single property:

- `IsEnabled`: A boolean value indicating whether the policy is enabled. The default value is `false`.
