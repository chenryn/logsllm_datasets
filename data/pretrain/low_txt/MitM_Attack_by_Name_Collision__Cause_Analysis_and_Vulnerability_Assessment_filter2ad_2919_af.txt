The WPAD name collision attack can be initiated at any time, beyond the control of new gTLD registries. Fortunately, our research indicates that although some high-value domains (HVDs) in victim Autonomous Systems (ASes) have been fully registered, the overall registration process is still in its early stages, and most HVDs remain under the control of new gTLD registries.

**Finding 7:** For the majority of new gTLDs that have not yet been fully registered, the window for potential attacks remains open. 

This situation conflicts with the original goal of providing more registration options and negatively impacts the revenue model of new gTLD registries. In response, ICANN has revised its policy to allow registrations after a 90-day "controlled interruption" period, rather than permanently blocking them [3].

Our analysis of the attack surface reveals that for most new gTLDs, only a small number of second-level domains (SLDs) are highly vulnerable to WPAD name collision attacks and require careful scrutiny. For example, for the .network gTLD, 96% of its domains in NXD traffic exhibit very low query volume and/or persistence. This suggests that a general-purpose block list would be ineffective; instead, per-SLD and per-TLD analysis, as conducted in this paper, is more appropriate. Therefore, the attack surface defined and quantified in this study provides a cost-effective approach to implementing scrutinized domain registration at the new gTLD registry level.

By aggregating the attack surface domains across all victim ASes, we found that out of the 738 new gTLDs delegated before August 25, 2015, 494 have HVDs. If all these gTLDs implement registration scrutiny, 97.4% of the global leaked WPAD queries in our dataset could be protected. Consistent with our findings in §VI, most new gTLDs have only a few HVDs that need protection. Among the 494 new gTLDs, 302 (61.3%) have fewer than 10 HVDs. Thus, for the majority of new gTLD registries, this defense can be deployed with minimal impact on business revenue while being highly effective.

Given the practical challenges of getting all 494 new gTLD registries to agree on deployment, we also evaluated the effectiveness of partial deployment. We ranked the 494 new gTLDs based on the percentage of protected leaked WPAD queries if they implemented scrutinized registration for HVDs. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) is shown in Figure 15. As illustrated, deploying the defense in just the top 18 (3.6%) new gTLDs can protect 80% of the leaked WPAD queries globally. Therefore, a feasible and highly effective strategy is to start with the most critical 20-40 new gTLDs.

**Victim AS Level Remediation:**
As shown in §IV, the majority of leaked WPAD queries originate from a few home access network ASes. In addition to the new gTLD registry-level defense, remediation at the victim AS level is also crucial.
