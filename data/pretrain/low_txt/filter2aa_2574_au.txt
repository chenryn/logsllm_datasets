### Media Dashboard Application for Managing Twitter Accounts

**TweetDeck** is a web-based application designed to manage multiple Twitter accounts within popular web browsers such as Chrome or Firefox. It is particularly favored by desktop users due to its user-friendly and sleek interface, which allows for the efficient management of more than one Twitter account. TweetDeck also offers the capability to share an account with your team without sharing your password, by setting different access permissions on owned accounts.

- **Features:**
  - **Unified Interface:** Displays all Twitter-related activities (e.g., tweets, messages, notifications, and searches) on a single screen.
  - **Customizable Columns:** Users can add various column types to their dashboard, including notifications, searches, lists, collections, activity, messages, mentions, followers, and trending topics. The interface allows for horizontal scrolling to view all columns.
  - **Search and Save:** TweetDeck enables users to perform advanced searches within Twitter and save current searches to automatically update with new content. Advanced search operators can be applied through an intuitive graphical user interface.

- **Key Features:**
  - **Similar to Facebook:** Users can post status updates, which can include text, photos, polls, links, and locations. Privacy settings can be adjusted for each post.
  - **Circles:** Google+ uses circles for privacy control, allowing users to add others to their circles without mutual agreement, similar to following on Twitter.
  - **Default Circles:** Friends, Family, and Acquaintances. Users can create additional circles as needed.
