**Type of Issue:**
- This is both a bug report and a feature request.

**Kubernetes Version:**
- Current master branch (use `kubectl version` to get the exact version)

**Environment:**
- **Cloud Provider or Hardware Configuration:** Azure
- **Operating System:** CentOS 7.2
- **Kernel Information:**
  - `uname -a` output: `Linux ma-k8s-0 3.10.0-327.36.3.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Mon Oct 24 16:09:20 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux`
- **Installation Tools:** Custom Ansible + kubeadm
- **Other Relevant Information:**

**Issue Description:**
- The Azure cloud provider throws an error stating "loadbalancer is misconfigured with a different backend pool" when I add custom load balancer rules with separate backend pools through the Azure Portal or via Azure Resource Templates. These custom rules are necessary for exposing the Kubernetes API endpoints.
- Adding a dedicated Azure Load Balancer specifically for the API is not feasible due to Azure's limitation that only one load balancer is allowed per Availability Set.

**Expected Behavior:**
- The Azure Cloud Provider should ignore existing backend pools and allow the addition of custom load balancer rules without throwing an error.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
- Follow the steps described in the "Issue Description" section above.

**Additional Information:**
- I have developed a fix for this issue and am currently testing it. I will submit a pull request (PR) shortly if the tests are successful.
- I created this issue before finalizing the PR to discuss the reasoning behind the current limitation.
