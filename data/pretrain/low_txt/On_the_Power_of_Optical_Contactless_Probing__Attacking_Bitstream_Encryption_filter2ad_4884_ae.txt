### 7. POTENTIAL COUNTERMEasures

To perform the extraction of bitstream data as described in this work, three requirements must be met: optical access to the transistors, discoverability of the plaintext transistors through Electro-Optical Frequency Mapping (EOFM), and the availability of a trigger signal for the final Electro-Optical Probing (EOP) acquisition. Each of these requirements can be targeted to hinder attacks.

#### 7.1 Optical Access

Protecting against optical access can be achieved through detection and prevention.

**Detection:**
Silicon light sensors are conventional solutions for detecting photons from light beams. However, if the incident light has a longer wavelength than the silicon band gap, as in our experiments with 1.3 µm light sources, the light sensors are only thermally stimulated. In such cases, no electron-hole pairs are generated, and the silicon photo sensor is not triggered. Therefore, silicon light sensors cannot detect optical probing attacks with 1.3 µm light sources.

However, thermal stimulation during EOP/EOFM attempts can cause local disturbances in temperature and current of the transistors on the chip, often referred to as Thermal Laser Stimulation (TLS). These variations influence the signal propagation delays of timing-dependent circuits, such as ring-oscillator Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs). As proposed in [22], one potential countermeasure could be to utilize a ring-oscillator PUF and distribute its ring-oscillators close to the decryption core and the bus. This would make it highly likely that any EOFM/EOP attempt would affect the behavior of the PUF, allowing the attack to be detected. The experimental results in [22] demonstrated that the attack can consequently be detected. As an anti-tamper reaction, the BBRAM key storage could be zeroized, or the entire decryption core could be locked down. Alternatively, less extreme countermeasures, such as generating gibberish bitstream data while optical probing is detected and returning to normal operation afterward, could be employed. Since PUFs have already been considered for secret key generation inside FPGAs [17], it is feasible to use the same PUFs as sensors to detect optical probing attacks. An additional advantage of this protection scheme is that it can also be employed by FPGA users on the reconfigurable logic without the need for hardware modifications.

**Prevention:**
A more comprehensive approach would be to fundamentally prevent optical access to the chip. For the silicon frontside, this is already a given due to the numerous metal layers of modern technologies. High-security ICs even implement active shield structures on the frontmost metal layers for protection. However, the silicon backside currently lacks such protection, and modern flip-chip packages even facilitate access.

Similar to power side-channel analysis countermeasures, adding gates carrying an inverted signal for cancellation of the EOP signal is also conceivable. However, this would require the development and verification of suitable structures and ASIC design tools, making it not an out-of-the-box solution.

An apparent solution would be to employ the same laser engraving process used for device markings to decrease the substrate's optical quality on top of the AES core. Although the signal quality and resolution are reduced, we could still acquire EOFM signals from structures directly under device markings during our experiments. Additionally, the presence of this passive structure cannot be monitored, and it could be removed by simple polishing. Nevertheless, such an approach would increase the effort needed for an attack and the probability of device damage and key loss.

A better approach would be to add an entirely opaque layer to the backside of the chip. Passive physical protections, such as heat spreader lids, can already make physical access to the substrate more challenging. However, they are not designed with protection in mind and can be removed without consequences [11]. Hence, a proper protection layer would need to be actively monitored. Such a scheme could make use of interactions between the protection structure and transistors on the chip to detect removal. First experimental results of a concept using special layers coated on the silicon substrate were presented in [2, 3]. In this case, the p-n junctions of standard transistors were operated to emit photons, which then travel inside the silicon substrate to the backside, where a multilayer coating reflects them. This reflected light then travels back to other transistors on the chip, configured as light detectors. If an attacker removes the coating layers from the silicon substrate, the reflection characteristics of the backside are changed, and thus, attack attempts can be detected. Since the layer is engineered to have non-standard angular-dependent reflection characteristics, simply coating the device with a new layer will not allow normal operation. Additionally, since standard transistors already present in the device are used as emitters and detectors, the overhead for the protection circuit is minimized. If such a scheme was implemented by FPGA vendors, it could effectively hinder all backside attacks, including optical probing.

Therefore, there are experimentally validated concepts available to either detect [22] or completely prevent [2, 3] optical probing access. If further research can validate their mass production compatibility, they could protect future generations of ICs against optical backside attacks.

#### 7.2 EOFM Discoverability

To increase the effort required for identifying the plaintext transistors through EOFM, designers of ASIC decryption cores could distribute and obfuscate the gates carrying the plaintext signal. However, it should be noted that this might introduce timing issues and overhead to the circuit.

#### 7.3 EOP Trigger

Since the attacker needs a suitable trigger for EOP waveform acquisition, restricting access to the configuration clock signal (CCLK) is a potential countermeasure. An easy way for FPGA users to hinder an attacker could be the use of Ball Grid Array (BGA) packages for both the FPGA and Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) and routing of CCLK and other relevant signals through the internal layers of the PCB. An attacker would then have to gain access through milling or drilling the PCB, which increases the probability of damage or key loss. In this context, it might also be advantageous to use the key storage power supply as an additional makeshift protection structure. If the corresponding trace is routed on internal PCB layers above and below the CCLK signal, this further increases the chance of key loss when milling.

It should be noted that this approach is only beneficial if an unstable clock source is used (see Sect. 6.2). Otherwise, the attacker can simply synchronize her equipment to a reset or power-on signal if these are freely available. An FPGA user could circumvent this by unlinking power-on/reset and configuration start. This is achievable by using a two-stage configuration process in FPGAs with dynamic or partial reconfiguration capability. If the first stage adds a random delay, it destroys the fixed relation between power-on/reset and configuration start.

A more thorough solution could come from the FPGA vendor side in the form of a circuit that destroys the fixed relationship between internal AES and external clock/data signals. Examples of such circuits include small random delay FIFO buffers, the addition of jitter to the external signals, or even a completely asynchronous internal clock. It should, however, be kept in mind that such a design might be challenging and result in lower configuration speeds due to added delays. Yet, if because of such an approach there is no direct or indirect external trigger available for the EOP acquisition, bitstream extraction cannot take place.

### 8. CONCLUSION

In this work, we assessed the threat of conducting an optical probing attack against a commercial device with little or no knowledge about the security circuits available to the adversary. To this end, we mounted an attack against the bitstream encryption feature of a modern FPGA. Despite having no prior knowledge about the underlying decryption cores, we demonstrated that renting the necessary equipment from a failure analysis lab for less than 10 days is enough for an attacker to localize the security circuits and extract plaintext data from the chip. Since modern silicon dies come in flip-chip packages, no chip preparation and silicon thinning were required for optical contactless probing, in contrast to previous attacks. We also demonstrated that 1 µm optical resolution is sufficient to successfully attack a 28 nm technology device. The primary reason modern chips are vulnerable to optical probing is the lack of effective protection of their backside. Hence, we provided a set of countermeasures that can be integrated into modern ICs at different phases of manufacturing and application design to protect them from this class of attack.
