### Introduction

Web services, due to their inherent business nature, often involve well-defined business semantics (e.g., Sales Orders). Therefore, one of the initial steps in developing these services is to create a conceptual structure that models business services. This model should encompass both business-related aspects, such as pricing and legal considerations, and technical aspects, such as Quality of Service (QoS), to support the technical realization of business services in the Internet of Services (IoS).

In the next section, we will describe our model for service description.

### Quality of Service (QoS) Parameters

- **Response Time**: Describes the service’s ability to respond to a request within a specified time frame.
- **Capacity**: Indicates how many requests the service can execute during a certain interval without degrading response time.
- **Availability**: Reflects the extent to which a service is available for provisioning.
- **Reliability**: Measures the consistency with which a service provides its functionality over time.

### Business and IT Aspects of Services

The following figure illustrates the business and IT aspects of services:

### Monitoring in the Internet of Services

Monitoring service execution is crucial for ensuring that promised service quality and consumer and provider obligations are met. To achieve this, it is important to understand the goals of different stakeholders (consumers, providers, and marketplace providers) and address the technical challenges that arise.

#### Goals

- **Service Consumers**: Want to receive the guaranteed quality. Early detection of problems helps reduce negative impacts. In some cases, consumers may be able to claim penalties.
- **Service Providers**: Need to ensure that Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are met to avoid penalties. Early identification of problems is critical, and there is also an interest in optimizing infrastructure to avoid constant overfulfillment of SLAs.
- **Marketplace Providers**: Must ensure high-quality service delivery to maintain a good reputation. Monitoring results can serve as a basis for resolving conflicts between parties regarding SLA violations.

#### Challenges

- **Access to Monitoring Data**: Determining who needs access to which monitoring information and when. Both service consumers and providers need to determine the cause and responsibility of failures while keeping underlying business processes confidential.
- **Business Level Monitoring**: Recent approaches to service monitoring mainly target the technical level, such as QoS parameters like response time and availability. There is a need for monitoring business aspects. A clear understanding of relevant parameters at both technical and business levels, and their relationships, is essential for automating the monitoring process.
- **Approach to Business Level Monitoring**: There are three main approaches to service monitoring: consumer-side, provider-side, and third-party monitoring. Consumer- and provider-side monitoring suffer from trust issues, while third-party monitoring can introduce a bottleneck.

### Summary and Outlook

In this paper, we have described the properties of business services and presented an approach for describing them. We have also discussed the challenges in monitoring and identified several issues to be addressed in the future. We are currently developing a toolset for creating services and an infrastructure for their execution and monitoring. Further research is necessary to resolve the challenges presented and integrate our findings into the toolset and infrastructure.
