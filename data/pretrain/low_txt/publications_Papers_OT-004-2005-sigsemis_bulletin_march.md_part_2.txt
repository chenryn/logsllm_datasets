### Currently Exploiting Ontologies with Millions to Tens of Millions of Entity and Relationship Instances

The potential for scaling these enterprise and industry-scale ontological islands by interconnecting them, thereby achieving the "network effect" envisioned by Tim Berners-Lee, is a promising endeavor.

#### Progress in 2004

In 2004, the Semantic Web Services Initiative (SWSI), comprising academic and industrial researchers from Europe, Asia, and the United States, was established to create an infrastructure that combines Semantic Web and Web services to enable automation in all aspects of Web services. SWSI not only advanced the development of OWL-S but also served as a forum for convergence with the products of the SWWS/WSMO/WSML/WSMX research effort, which provides Web service providers with a core set of constructs for describing the properties of their Web services in a computer-interpretable form.

Ongoing projects such as OWL-S, LSDIS METEOR-S, and DERI SWWS have studied important aspects related to the lifecycle of semantic web processes. Industrial researchers have also been deeply involved in defining standards to ensure real-world implementation and use of semantics, Web services, and Web processes. Notable ongoing work on standards includes:

- Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (BPEL4WS or BPEL) by Microsoft, IBM, and BEA
- WSCL by HP
- BPML by Microsoft
- WSCI by SUN, BEA, Yahoo, and others
- XLANG by Microsoft
- WSFL by IBM

#### Trends for 2005

Analysts predict that the Semantic Web, which will understand human language, will replace the current Web by 2005. However, progress has been slow but steady, and it is more likely that this milestone will be pushed to 2010. Key areas for further research include functional and behavioral descriptions of Web services and Web processes.

Currently, few commercial products have successfully implemented a semantic layer alongside a robust Web services infrastructure, despite significant industrial support for standards like WSDL, BPEL, and UDDI. Many vendors are taking a "wait-and-see" approach while emerging standards converge.

In 2005, while most commercial vendors remain hesitant, many industrial research groups, including IBM, HP, France Telecom, and Fujitsu, will further apply semantics to Web services for innovative, discovery-driven use cases. Leadership from DERI and the W3C has expressed a strong interest in converging the best of each specification, which could occur in 2005, prompting vendors to implement these aligned standards.

### An Interview with Prof. William King

**University Professor, Katz Graduate School of Business, University of Pittsburgh, Founding President of AIS**

**Interviewer: Miltiadis**

1. **Foundation of AIS**
   - **Miltiadis:** Dear Prof. King, we are delighted that you agreed to this interview. Let’s start by asking you to provide some information about the foundation of AIS. You were its founding President and First Executive Director. How difficult was it to set it up, and what was your ultimate objective?
   - **Prof. King:** Although there was strong dissent from those who felt that existing organizations served their own needs, I found that very senior people in IS generally agreed on the need for a professional organization to speak for, and to, IS academics. So, I concluded that, rather than debate or study it further, I’d just do it. AIS is quite successful, but it’s not yet truly “global,” as about 70% of members are from North America. We need to work on that.

2. **Next Milestones for IS Discipline**
   - **Miltiadis:** Several people claim that the IS field has reached a significant maturity. AIS has grown, and several journals have been established. What are the next milestones for the evolution of the discipline? Do you feel that they are related to the concept of the Knowledge Society?
   - **Prof. King:** From a pragmatic point of view, we need more publication opportunities in “A” journals. The ratio of “A” journal papers published each year to the total AIS membership is ridiculously low. E-journals such as the Journal of AIS seem to be the only economic solution. In a “knowledge society,” print will be more and more minimal, but that hasn’t happened easily and naturally, as reflected by the current status of JAIS. We need to proactively change that.

3. **Leading a Research Community**
   - **Miltiadis:** Leading a leading association is an extremely difficult task. Throughout your career, you have managed to serve as the chair/president of AIS and INFORMS. How difficult has it been to lead a whole research community, especially knowing that the critical bet is to lead the community beyond any well-known boundaries?
   - **Prof. King:** Leading scholars is like “herding cats.” But it’s important. I have set high goals and then not been too disappointed when they sometimes weren’t fully realized. The “boundaries” notion that you bring up is also important. I find that scholars are quite willing to accept and adapt to change, but they are less willing to initiate it. So, that becomes the role of a “leader of scholars.”

4. **New Context for IS Research**
   - **Miltiadis:** We are experiencing the beginning of the new century. Semantic Web, Mobile, and Ubiquitous technologies create a new context for the perceived borders of IS. What is the new context for IS research? Do we have to face new problems?
   - **Prof. King:** The field of IS changes every day, and I think it attracts people who know that and enjoy it. I’m no better able to forecast the future than anyone else, but IS people will, I am confident, create it and cope with it as the boundaries of technology expand. Although IS is in a “low” period now, so long as we continue to address the opportunities provided by evolving technology, we’ll prosper.

5. **Top Challenges for MIS Field**
   - **Miltiadis:** What do you consider to be the top challenges for the MIS field? Do you believe that we are still looking for the IT artifact?
   - **Prof. King:** I’m not an “IS artifact” fan. I believe in pluralism, especially in such a dynamic field. The top challenge is to remain relevant and not let rigor totally dominate. (I believe that this is a potential problem with the top journals; not necessarily with “lesser” ones.)

6. **Qualitative vs. Quantitative Research**
   - **Miltiadis:** Lately, it seems that we are moving away from hard-core quantitative experimental research into the area of qualitative research. Do you believe this new approach has the ability to address properly the current issues in IS research?
   - **Prof. King:** Qualitative research complements, but certainly cannot replace, quantitative approaches. The two can coexist, and increasingly, the same researchers will be using both approaches. I think the “third paradigm” of Design Science holds many opportunities as well.

7. **Knowledge Sharing in Research Communities**
   - **Miltiadis:** I have a myopic point of view, driven by my personal interest in learning and knowledge management. How would you evaluate knowledge sharing in our research communities? Should we adopt new technologies and innovative ideas to achieve more effective knowledge representation and exploitation?
   - **Prof. King:** E-journals, as I noted earlier, are part of the answer. Print journals have page quotas and high marginal costs. An expanding field needs high-quality e-journals because they have almost zero marginal costs. For instance, JAIS has excellent editors and is sponsored by AIS, but it has not yet attracted enough of the best research to warrant an “A” rating. We need to collectively make that happen. Senior scholars should be willing to help JAIS along by submitting their best work there. Junior scholars probably should not take the risk until journals like this are recognized to be top quality.

8. **Evolution of KM**
   - **Miltiadis:** You have an excellent record on KM and a special interest in the topic. How would you judge the evolution of KM? What is it all about? A big bubble?
   - **Prof. King:** It’s very faddish, but that isn’t all bad. Most new ideas go through a faddish phase and then get integrated into routine operations. For instance, when “quality” was faddish, there were vice presidents of quality; now quality is integrated into everything, and because few people have “quality” in their title, some think it was just a fad. In fact, it’s a key part of everything that organizations do. KM will go through the same lifecycle.

9. **Teaching Paradigm**
   - **Miltiadis:** Given your extraordinary interest in teaching and postgraduate studies, I would like you to share your teaching paradigm. Personally, I am excited about your propositions on Andragogy.
   - **Prof. King:** Andragogy, as opposed to pedagogy (which means “child learning”), puts more responsibility on the student for every part of the learning process. It is based on quite different assumptions than those on which pedagogy is based. I’ve tried various ways to implement this; some have been very successful, and some have not.

10. **Paradigm Shifts in IS**
    - **Miltiadis:** Things seem to evolve rapidly within the IS field. Do you believe that we have experienced any major paradigm shift? Should we be looking forward to it?
    - **Prof. King:** I think that we’re overly introspective in this field. Good ideas are widely distributed among professionals. Our major central task should be to facilitate communications and provide outlets for good ideas. I don’t believe in trying to “standardize” anything—paradigms, artifacts, research methods, or anything else.

11. **Gap Between Practitioners and Researchers**
    - **Miltiadis:** Within the IS research community, we seem to believe that there is a gap between practitioners and researchers. Do you think we can benefit from each other? What are your thoughts on that?
    - **Prof. King:** There is not enough exchange between the two groups. Many IS academics have good personal ties with practitioners, and the research centers certainly help, but we need to do more, especially to help young researchers develop such ties.

12. **Main Challenge in IS**
    - **Miltiadis:** Technology versus information versus people. What would you consider the main challenge to be?
    - **Prof. King:** I don’t think “versus” is the right term. An IS involves all three. Some researchers will focus primarily on one, but ignoring the others is a recipe for failure or irrelevance.

13. **Role of International Associations**
    - **Miltiadis:** I am sure that you have thought several times about collaboration in International Associations. Many intangible assets, enthusiasm, a shared vision, multi-culture, etc., a whole world in a snapshot. How difficult is it to exploit all these synergies towards the common wealth? In other words, what is the role of International associations in the new Era of Globalization?
    - **Prof. King:** They obviously should become more and more important. I’m not a revolutionary, but for professional purposes, the era of the nation is over.

14. **Vision for ICIS 2005**
    - **Miltiadis:** Bill, next year you are co-chairing our leading international conference, ICIS 2005. Would you like to share with us your vision for this conference?
    - **Prof. King:** First, we’d like to maintain the high level of research quality—i.e., “Do no harm.” Then, we’d like to encourage innovation and creative thinking. We’ve got a track devoted to that, and we plan to continue the Senior Scholars “experiment” that was so successful in Washington, DC. In general, I’d like to refocus ICIS back toward its roots—a conference for top-quality research. Now that we have AMCIS, ECIS, and PACIS to serve a broader set of purposes, that’s feasible.

15. **Understanding of the Semantic Web**
    - **Miltiadis:** We have started informing the IS community about the importance of the Semantic Web. What is your general understanding of the “concept” of the Semantic Web?
    - **Prof. King:** Creating greater “web intelligence” is an important goal. The Semantic Web is one approach to that, but there are many issues to face and problems to solve for it to achieve its potential.

16. **Future Plans**
    - **Miltiadis:** What are your plans for the next couple of years? I am more than impressed by your activities. Only your posts in ISWORLD from time to time show a very active researcher. Is it a life motive?
    - **Prof. King:** I’m so delighted to be alive after being told that I was going to die and then surviving three major surgeries, two of which were liver transplants. When I got the Leo “lifetime achievement” award at ICIS 04, I told them that I was now starting out on a “second life” and have the goal of earning a second Leo in twenty years or so.

17. **Next Generation IS Research**
    - **Miltiadis:** Bill, what is your opinion about the so-called next generation IS research? Is there any milestone that you consider to be of critical importance for its evolution?
    - **Prof. King:** The field has been evolving toward better use and creation of theory that can help in solving practical problems. I think, and hope, that will continue.

18. **Formation of the New Special Interest Group on Semantic Web and Information Systems on AIS**
    - **Miltiadis:** Any thoughts that you would like to share about the formation of the New Special Interest Group on Semantic Web and Information Systems on AIS?
    - **Prof. King:** It’s a very positive development. As I noted earlier, there’s great promise with the Semantic Web, and a Special Interest Group should facilitate progress.

19. **Parting Thoughts**
    - **Miltiadis:** Dear Bill, thank you for your time. It was an excellent talk. Would you like to share any parting thoughts with our readers?
    - **Prof. King:** I hope that every academic in IS will consider how privileged we all are. We get to work on problems that we are interested in; not on those which others direct us to do. We get to set our own schedules for the most part. We teach subjects that we love to young people who, if we are wise, help us to stay “forever young.” It’s harder not to be able to teach from last year’s notes, but it’s also invigorating. We get paid for doing things that we’d do for nothing. I’ve come to work every day of my career excited about what good works I might do and what I might learn that day. I wish that for everyone and I hope I can keep that outlook as long as possible.
