## Key Concepts

### Tradecraft
- **Perceptual Biases**: Expectations, Resistance, Ambiguities, Biases in Evaluating Evidence, Consistency, Missing Information, Discredited Evidence, Biases in Estimating Probabilities (Availability, Anchoring, Overconfidence), Biases in Perceiving Causality (Rationality, Attribution)
- **Techniques**:
  - Key Assumptions Check
  - Quality of Information Check
  - Contrarian Techniques
  - Devil’s Advocacy
  - High Impact/Low Probability Analysis
  - “What If?” Analysis
  - Red Team

### OPSEC (Operational Security)
- Identify Critical Information
- Analyze Threats
- Assess Risks
- Apply Countermeasures
- Analyze Vulnerabilities

### Common Pitfalls
- **Overconfidence**
- **Trust**
- **Perceived Insignificance**
- **Guilt by Association**
- **Packet Origin**
- **Cleartext**
- **Documentation**

## Best Practices for Using a VPN
- **Traffic Encryption**
- **Location Obfuscation**
- **Request Concealment**
- **Listener Location Considerations**
- **Provider Reliability**

### Important Note
- PPTP is considered broken. Avoid using it.

## Case Studies

### LulzSec/AntiSec
- **Lessons Learned**:
  - Ensure Tor usage is safe.
  - Always check what you are exposing.
  - Maintain OPSEC 24/7.

### Harvard Bomb Hoax
- **Failures**:
  - Harvard Network Registration
  - Outgoing Traffic Logs
  - Pervasive Surveillance
- **Key Takeaways**:
  - Key Assumptions Check
  - High Impact/Low Probability Analysis
  - Bridge Relays
  - Traffic Analysis Preparation

### Silk Road/DPR
- **Analysis**:
  - Hidden service descriptor request rate over one day (Figure 4).
  - Control of hidden service directories and tracking.
  - Measurement data from Tables I and II.
- **References**:
  - Biryukov, Pustogarov, Weinmann: *Trawling for Tor Hidden Services: Detection, Measurement, Deanonymization*, 2013.

## Phone Security
- **Betrayal Factors**:
  - Metadata
  - Location
  - Contacts
  - Networks
  - Unique Identifiers
  - Cookies
  - Searches
  - Weak Cryptography
  - Repeated Access
  - Autoconnect
  - Apps
  - Pattern of Life

### Example: Current Volumes and Limits
- **Dupe Methodology**:
  - Compare records within various time windows that share identical selectors and locations.
  - Specific identifiers: LAC, CellID, VLR, DesigChannelID, IMEI, ESN, IMSI, MIN, TMSI, MDN, CLI, ODN, MSISDN, RegFMID, CdFMID, CgFMID, RegGID, CdGID, RegIID, Kc, CdIID, CgIID, MSRN, Rand, Sres, Opcode, RQ1, XR1, Q_CK1, Q_IK1, AU1, NewPTMSI, OSME, DSME, RTMSI, PDP_Address, TEID, TLLI, PTMSI, PDDG.

### Perfect Scenario
- Target uploading a photo to a social media site taken with a mobile device.
- **Information Gained**:
  - Geo-location settings
  - Connected networks
  - Websites visited
  - Buddy lists
  - Documents downloaded
  - Encryption used and supported
  - User agents

### Targeting Telephony and DNI Systems
- **Data Points**:
  - Call logs
  - SMS
  - SIM card leads
  - Email addresses
  - IMEI/IMSI
  - Unique identifiers
  - Blackberry PINS

## Burner Phone Usage
- **DO**:
  - Advance Purchase
  - Register Far Away
  - Lie to Phone Companies
  - Stay Dumb
  - Remove Battery
  - Fake Contacts
  - Minimize Use
  - Move & Switch
  - Falsify Call Network
  - Purpose Equipment
  - Always Kill

- **DON'T**:
  - Co-Localize
  - Co-Activate
  - Co-Contact
  - Store Real Data
  - Match Entry/Exit
  - Bridge Online Metadata

## Messaging Security
- **E-Mail**:
  - Spam Fighting Aids Tracking
  - Webmail Using HTTP
  - Weak Server-Side Storage
  - Encrypted Content Not Metadata
  - Insecure Client-Side Logging
  - Bad Retention Habits
  - Google
  - IM Is Not Much Better

### Case Study: CIA/Petraeus
- **Failures**:
  - Technique Already Identified & Compromised
  - Pervasive Surveillance Designed to Expose Access Correlation
  - Deleted Things Aren’t
  - Understand & Manage Insecure Channels
  - Quality of Information Check, “What If?”

### Common Broken/Compromised Services
- **Webmail**:
  - Commercial Webmail
  - Run Your Own Mailserver
  - Metadata’s Still a Problem

- **Skype**:
  - PRISM, SIGINT Enabling, JTRIG, Forced “Upgrades”, Pre-MS EOL
  - Avoid Skype

- **Chats**:
  - IRC
  - TLS Only Protects You to the Server
  - GChat’s “Off The Record” Isn’t the Same as OTR
  - First OTR Message

### Potentially Secure Services
- **OTR Implementations** (But Which Ones?)
- **Cryptocat?**
- **Bitmessage?**
- **Needs**:
  - More Auditing
  - Steganography

## Stylometrics
- **Best Practices**:
  - Resist Providing a Corpus
  - Obfuscate
  - Machine Translate
  - Imitate
  - Alpha Tools: JStylo/Anonymouth

## Steganography
- **Hiding in Plain Sight**:
  - Reported but Docs Not Released
  - P2P Traffic High Volume/Low Value
  - GCHQ TEMPORA Minimizes, 30% Ingest Reduction
  - Need to Hide in This Flood

## Hacking Culture
- **Burner Rules for IDs**:
  - IRL Identity Real and Separate
  - Know & Compartmentalize Pseudonyms
  - Cred Is Another Enemy
  - Really Burn Them, No Really

### After the Breach
- **Contingency Planning**
- **Plausible Deniability**
- **Adversary Capability**
- **Seek Advice in Advance**
- **Support Those Who Provide It**
- **Good Luck & Never Surrender to Obedience**
