# EtherSniff: Stealthily Monitoring an Established Ethernet Network

## Introduction
Hardwired network paths are often considered secure, with no need for internal encryption. However, the insertion of a physical sniffer can break the link on network interfaces, triggering alarms. Or can it?

## Encoding Techniques

### 10baseT
- **Speed:** 10Mbps, baseband (not carrier modulated), using twisted pair.
- **Data Stream:** 10Mbps, Manchester coded, producing a 20MHz square wave signal.
- **Output Levels:** +2.5V and -2.5V.
- **Full Duplex:** Achieved with two separate simplex pairs: TX and RX.
- **Reference:** [Wikipedia - 10BASE-T](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10BASET)

### Manchester Coding
- **Coding Scheme:** Output = Data XOR Clock
- **Feature:** Ensures a state transition with every bit.
- **Reference:** [Wikipedia - Manchester Code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_code)

### 100baseT
- **Speed:** 100Mbps, baseband, using twisted pair.
- **Data Stream:** 100Mbps, 4B5B line coding to ensure sufficient clocking, producing a 125Mbps symbol rate.
- **Output Levels:** +1V, 0V, and -1V.
- **Full Duplex:** Achieved with two separate simplex pairs: TX and RX.
- **4B5B Line Coding:** Ensures sufficient 1s density for 0V DC offset and includes signaling.
- **MLT-3 Coding:** 3 voltage levels, 4 states. Moves to the next state on 1, stays on the current state on 0. The max base frequency is Â¼ the data rate.

## Tapping Methods

### DC Coupling
- **Description:** A direct copper connection between the wires being monitored and the monitoring device.
- **Pros:**
  - Easy to construct and connect.
  - Cheap and passive hardware; no power required.
- **Cons:**
  - Accidental DC short could break the link.
  - Tap and branch cause reflections, which could break the link.
  - Accidental reversal of TX/RX or auto-negotiation of MDI state can transmit, breaking the link.

### Inductive Coupling
- **Description:** Build a small transformer with the pair being monitored to pull a bit of the power.
- **Pros:**
  - Minimal impedance change, making it hard to detect.
  - Insulation remains intact, preventing accidental DC shorts.
  - The receiver amplifier acts as a buffer, preventing accidental transmission.
- **Cons:**
  - Inductively coupled signal is high impedance, requiring an amplifier.
  - Transformers are finicky and hard to get right.

## Hardware Assembly

### DC Coupled System
- **Setup:**
  - Punch a 100 ohm resistor across the Orange pair of two 568B RJ-45 wall jacks.
  - Carefully cut about 12 inches of the outer jacket off the Ethernet cable to be monitored.
  - Untwist the Orange pair to give yourself about an inch of straight wires.
  - Using the non-cutting side of a punch tool, punch the Orange wire into the Green pair of one of the 568B RJ-45 wall jacks.
  - Repeat the last two steps with the Green pair.
  - Connect two standard Ethernet cables from the RJ-45 wall jacks to your monitoring system.
- **Monitoring:**
  - `eth0` sees traffic one way, `eth1` sees traffic the other way.
  - Use tools like `tcpdump` or Wireshark to capture and display the data.
  - Capture with precise timestamps, add some scripting, and you can have a single combined data flow.

### Inductive Coupling
- **Note:** Come see me next year for more details.

## Thinking Black Hat
- **Potential Vulnerabilities:**
  - Shared phone rooms and wiring closets.
  - Drop ceilings.
  - "Protected" conduits (e.g., pipe cutter from Home Depot).
  - Manholes, J-Boxes, etc.

## Thinking White Hat
- **Security Measures:**
  - Physical security (see other presentations at DefCon).
  - Encryption (IPSec, TLS, etc.).
  - Encrypt everything; CPU is cheap.
  - Periodic Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) measurements.
  - Gigabit Ethernet (stay tuned).

## The Holy Grail: Gigabit Ethernet
- **Challenges:**
  - Auto-negotiation is a requirement of the spec.
  - All four pairs are used simultaneously for TX and RX.
  - 1000baseT is far more susceptible to reflections and changes in impedance.
- **Current Status:**
  - Nothing public exists yet, but it's not impossible.
  - A well-funded organization has likely already figured this out.

## Conclusion
- **Key Points:**
  - A careful attacker with no budget can easily tap into unprotected 10baseT and 100baseT.
  - A decently funded attacker can probably do the same with 1000baseT.
  - If you can't physically secure your network links, encrypt your traffic (IPSec, TLS, etc.).
