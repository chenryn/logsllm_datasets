# Summary of the New Feature/Enhancement
PowerToys Run currently does not function effectively as a focus switcher. While it lists running processes in the dropdown, it does not prioritize them as the first result and instead tends to create new processes. This enhancement proposes adding an option to prioritize open processes in the dropdown.

## Description of Use
A new setting will be added to the PowerToys Run configuration to enable the prioritization of running processes. When this option is enabled, opening PowerToys Run will display the usual menu. Upon entering a search query, any results that match running processes will be prioritized in the list, making it easier to switch focus to already open applications.
