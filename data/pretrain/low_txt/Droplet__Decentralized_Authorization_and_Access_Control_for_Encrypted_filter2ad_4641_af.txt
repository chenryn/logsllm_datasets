### Methods for Distributing Public Keys for Verification

In contemporary practice, the conventional methods for verifying public keys rely on internal key servers or, at a broader scale, a hierarchical network of certificate authorities (CAs) issuing X.509 certificates. However, these approaches come with inherent weaknesses, such as unauthorized certificate issuance (e.g., Symantec's issuance of unauthorized certificates for Google) and the lack of support for non-domain identities [76, 97].

Alternative public-key-based approaches, such as SPKI/SDSI [42] and subsequent schemes [43], aim to eliminate the need for complex X.509 public-key infrastructure and CAs. These alternatives are either based on local names, suitable for single administrative domains like smart homes, or they build upon an organically growing trust model, such as PGP’s web of trust [112]. While Droplet is underpinned by the concept of signature-based schemes, it avoids the complexities of certificate-chain discovery and does not require a complex certificate infrastructure (§4). The current prototype of Droplet supports pseudonyms and can be extended with a publicly-auditable directory of keys and identity proofs, similar to Keybase, which maps digital identities (e.g., Twitter) to public keys in a verifiable manner [66].

### Blockchain-Based Systems

Decentralized blockchain-based applications, which operate without trusted intermediaries, have gained significant attention beyond their use in cryptocurrencies. Examples include medical data access [13], IoT device commissioning and management [60], financial auditing [80], name and identity management [3, 14], software-update transparency and verifiability [83], and preventing unauthorized certificate issuance [76].

Among the systems most closely related to our work are Enigma [113, 114], which envisions a decentralized personal data management and secure multi-party computation platform for multilateral sharing. Enigma uses a single data encryption key among the sharing parties, lacking fine-grained crypto-based access, and requires blockchain transactions for each read/write request, limiting scalability. Calypso [68] introduces on-chain encrypted secrets with associated access policies, enforced collectively by trustees via threshold encryption and distributed key generation. The time required for each key access request ranges from 0.2 to 8 seconds, depending on the number of trustees.

None of these systems address the challenge of fine-grained access control for encrypted time-series data. Additionally, our design mimics the flow of authorization services in production environments, allowing Droplet to seamlessly integrate with and support current services, as demonstrated through several case studies (e.g., serverless computing, §8.2).

### Conclusion

This paper introduces Droplet, a decentralized access control system that enables secure, selective, and flexible access control, empowering users with full control over their data. Droplet combines a decentralized authorization service with a novel encryption-based access control scheme tailored for time-series data. Our prototype implementation and experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of Droplet as a decentralized authorization service for end-to-end encrypted data streams.
