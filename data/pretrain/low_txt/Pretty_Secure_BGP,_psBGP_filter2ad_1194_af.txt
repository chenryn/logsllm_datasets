#### Preface
In this section, we discuss the dynamics of Prefix Assertion Lists (PALs) and their management. The total number of Autonomous Systems (ASes) observed in July 2004 was 18,048, including 17,884 ASes on August 1, 2004, and 164 ASes that were removed during July 2004.

#### Table 5: Projected PAL Dynamics
Table 5 illustrates the projected dynamics of PALs based on the data set from July 2004. It is evident that the more asserting peers an AS has, the more PA changes are required. We recommend a scenario where each AS has at most two asserting peers (n = 2), even if it has more than two peers. This configuration provides redundancy, ensuring that if one of the two asserting peers fails to perform its due diligence, the other can take over.

In the recommended scenario (n = 2), 16% of the ASes need to update their PALs during the month. Specifically:
- 8.4% of the ASes require only one PA change.
- 4% of the ASes need 2 to 4 PA changes.
- 1.9% of the ASes need 5 to 10 PA changes.
- A small number of ASes need more than 100 changes.
- AS 701 (UUNET) and its two asserting peers require approximately 5,000 changes.

While 5,000 prefix assertion updates in a month are significant, it is feasible for a large organization like UUNET.

### 6.5. Discussion
The timeliness of PAL updates is crucial for ensuring service availability. PALs must be updated and distributed promptly to verify prefix ownership using current information. To ensure that an asserting peer updates the PALs for a given AS in a timely manner, a service agreement between them is likely necessary, such as an extension to their existing agreements.

Since there is usually a delay window before newly delegated prefixes are used on the Internet, an asserting peer should update its PAL to include these new prefixes within that delay window. Updates for prefix removals can be prioritized lower, as they have relatively minor security implications.

PALs, along with other certificates (e.g., ASNumCerts, SpeakerCerts, and corresponding Certificate Revocation Lists), can be distributed with BGP update messages in newly defined path attributes [25]. This allows them to be distributed as quickly as prefix announcements and be accessible without depending on BGP routes. These certificates might also be stored in centralized directories [25]. However, a "pull" model might make it challenging to determine how often these directories should be checked.

To the best of our knowledge, no similar study has been conducted to project the number of certificate updates per AS by S-BGP and soBGP. We are currently conducting such a study for soBGP and will compare psBGP with soBGP in this aspect.

### 7. Related Work
Significant research has been published on securing routing protocols. Perlman [34] was among the first to recognize and study the problem of securing routing infrastructures. Bellovin [5] discussed security vulnerabilities of Internet routing protocols as early as 1989. More recently, Bellovin and Gansner [6] discussed potential link-cutting attacks against Internet routing. Kumar [27] proposed the use of digital signatures and sequence numbers to protect the integrity and freshness of routing updates. Smith et al. [38] proposed the use of digital signatures, sequence numbers, and a loop-free path-finding algorithm for securing distance vector routing protocols, including BGP. Murphy [30, 31] performed a thorough analysis of BGP vulnerabilities and protections.

The most concrete security proposal to date for addressing BGP vulnerabilities is S-BGP [23, 24, 37], which proposes the use of centralized PKIs for authenticating AS numbers and IP prefix ownership. The S-BGP PKIs are rooted at Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), parallel to the existing system of AS number assignment and IP address allocation. AS PATH is protected using nested digital signatures, ensuring its integrity.

soBGP [41] proposes the use of a web-of-trust model for AS public key authentication and a centralized hierarchical model for IP prefix ownership verification. AS PATH is verified for plausibility by checking against an AS topology graph. Each AS issues certificates listing all peering ASes, allowing the construction of a global AS graph. Thus, the existence of an AS PATH can be verified.

Goodell et al. [15] proposed the Inter-domain Routing Validator (IRV) protocol to improve the security and accuracy of BGP. Each AS builds an IRV server that is authoritative for the inter-domain routing information of that AS. An IRV can query another IRV to verify BGP update messages received by its hosting AS. Improper prefix origination and AS PATH might be detected by uncovering inconsistencies among responses from other IRVs. One advantage of IRV is that it supports incremental deployment without requiring changes to the existing routing infrastructure.

Kruegel et al. [26] propose a model of AS topology augmented with physical Internet connectivity to detect and stop anomalous route announcements. Their approach passively monitors BGP control traffic and does not require modifications to the existing routing infrastructure, making it easy to deploy.

Aiello et al. [2] formalize the IP prefix delegation system, present a proof system, and propose efficient constructions for authenticating prefix origination. They analyze real routing information to restore the IP delegation relationship over the Internet, discovering that the current prefix delegation on the Internet is relatively static and dense. However, they note that it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to determine this delegation structure.

Listen and Whisper [39] are mechanisms for protecting the BGP data plane and control plane, respectively. Listen detects invalid data forwarding by detecting "incomplete" TCP connections, while Whisper uncovers invalid routing announcements by detecting inconsistencies among path signatures of multiple update messages originating from a common AS but traversing different paths.

Hu et al. [20] propose the Secure Path Vector (SPV) protocol for securing BGP. SPV uses efficient cryptographic primitives, such as authentication trees and one-way hash chains, to protect AS PATH. It is shown that SPV is more efficient than S-BGP.

### 8. Concluding Remarks
S-BGP and soBGP have taken different approaches to address security in BGP. Essentially, psBGP combines their best features while fundamentally differing in the approach to verifying IP prefix ownership. As no centralized infrastructure for tracing changes in IP prefix ownership currently exists, and building such an infrastructure would be quite difficult, we suggest that the decentralized approach taken by psBGP provides a more feasible means of increasing confidence in correct prefix origination. We also suggest that the certificate structure and trust model in psBGP have practical advantages. We hope that our comparison of S-BGP, soBGP, and psBGP will help focus discussion on the technical merits of the various proposals and stimulate discussion in the Internet community about alternate design choices and trust models for securing BGP.
