## Abstract
The vision of the Semantic Web has driven hundreds of researchers and practitioners to develop applications that could unlock the full potential of the web. While there is a clear understanding of Web 1.0 and Web 2.0, the current status and position of the Semantic Web, also known as Web 3.0, remains less defined. This paper presents a landscape that illustrates and captures the trends in the Semantic Web, with the aim of guiding future developments.

## 1. Introduction
The vision of the Semantic Web has been hailed as the next big thing for information systems. The publication of the article "The Semantic Web" in *Scientific American Magazine* in May 2001 by Tim Berners-Lee, James Hendler, and Ora Lassila sparked a wave of global research. Thousands of research papers have been written, and hundreds of applications have been developed. However, the research trends are not always clear. This paper addresses this by summarizing a survey (Cardoso, 2007) that provides an account of current Semantic Web practices. The findings are based on 627 surveys conducted from December 12, 2006, to January 26, 2007.

## 2. Web.X – A Story in Three Chapters
The Semantic Web is often referred to as Web 3.0. While previous web technologies, such as Web 1.0 and Web 2.0, achieved remarkable success, there is no consensus on whether Web 3.0 will achieve similar levels of success. Some researchers believe that the Semantic Web is still in its infancy and will eventually revolutionize user experiences, while others argue that it has become almost mythical due to the long time since its introduction.

- **Web 1.0**: Focused on providing static information content to users.
- **Web 2.0**: Introduced interactivity through features like tagging, social networks, online media, content aggregation, and syndication (RSS), mashups, and folksonomies.

Success stories from Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 are well-documented. Web 1.0 delivered innovative solutions such as DoubleClick, mp3.com, Britannica Online, personal websites, screen scraping, and content management systems. Web 2.0 produced landmarks like Google AdSense, Flickr, BitTorrent, Napster, Wikipedia, and del.icio.us.

### The State of Web 3.0
The building blocks for the Semantic Web, such as RDF, OWL, and microformats, are already available. During the 2007 Semantic Technology Conference, several startups demonstrated their commitment to Semantic Web technologies. Companies like Twine, Garlik, and Hakia are actively working to implement the Semantic Web:

- **Twine**: Uses the Semantic Web, natural language processing, and machine learning to enhance information sharing and organization.
- **Garlik**: Employs Semantic Web technologies to help users monitor and protect their personal information online.
- **Hakia**: A semantic search engine that uses natural language processing to deliver more relevant search results.

However, despite these efforts, the number of searches for "Semantic Web" keywords has declined since 2004, as shown in Figure 1. This trend can be interpreted in two ways: either the hype is fading, or the concept is now widely accepted and understood, reducing the need for further searching.

To better understand the current research and industrial efforts, we conducted a survey in 2006 and 2007. The results are summarized in the following section.

## 3. Current Trends of the Semantic Web
The survey was divided into five categories: Demographics, Tools and Languages, Ontology, Ontology Size, and Production. The complete results can be found in (Cardoso, 2007). Here, we present a summary of the key findings:

### Ontology Editors
Respondents were asked about the ontology editors they use. The most frequently cited editor was Protégé, with a market share of 68.2%. Other popular editors include SWOOP (13.6%), OntoEdit (12.2%) (now called OntoStudio), and Altova SemanticWorks (10.3%).

### Ontology Languages
Over 75% of ontologists use OWL to develop their ontologies, and more than 64% rely on RDF(S). Description Logic and FLogic are also used, with penetration rates of 17% and 11.8%, respectively. WSML (Web Service Modeling Language) has gained some popularity (3.7%).

### Reasoning Engines
The most commonly used reasoning engine is Jena (53.6%). Other popular engines include Racer (28%), Pellet (23.7%), FaCT++ (13.3%), and OWLJessKB (8.1%).

### Ontology Domains
Respondents were asked about the industries for which they develop ontologies. Education (31%) and Computer Software (28.5%) are the best-represented industries, followed by Government (17%) and Business Services (17%).

### Methodologies
Sixty percent of respondents do not use any specific methodology for developing ontologies. The most adopted methodologies are METHONTOLOGY (13.7%), On-To-Knowledge (7.4%), and Uschold and King’s method (4.2%).

### Purpose of Using Ontologies
The primary reason for using ontologies is to share a common understanding of the structure of information among people and software agents, so models can be understood by both humans and computers (69.9%).

### Techniques Used with Ontologies
The most common technique used with ontologies is ontology mapping (67.1%). Other techniques include integrating ontologies (40.7%) and merging ontologies (33.9%). Twenty-six percent of respondents align ontologies.

### Ontology Size
Most respondents (72.9%) indicated that their smallest ontologies had fewer than 100 concepts. For typical ontologies, 44% of respondents stated that such ontologies had between 100 and 1000 concepts.

### Production
More than 70% of respondents plan to adopt ontology-based systems, while 27.9% have no plans to use such systems in the future.

## 4. Conclusions
Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 have had a significant impact on society and e-commerce. The next step in the evolution of the web is the Semantic Web, or Web 3.0. The information presented in this article serves as a checkpoint to frame the current status and trends in the Semantic Web. It depicts a paradigm shift from an idea to the development and use of real and concrete semantic solutions.
