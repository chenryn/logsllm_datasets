Email spoofing is a complex issue involving multiple parties, and addressing it requires collaborative efforts. 

### More Accurate Standards
Email providers often fail to deliver a secure and reliable email service due to ambiguous definitions in email protocols. To mitigate this, more precise protocol descriptions are essential to eliminate inconsistencies in the implementation of multi-party protocols. For instance, the DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) standard should specify when a DKIM signature should be added to forwarded emails. While it is reasonable for forwarders to add DKIM signatures to enhance the credibility of emails, they should not do so for emails that have not passed DKIM verification.

### User Interface Notifications
The rendering of email user interfaces (UIs) significantly influences users' perception of an email's authenticity. However, most webmail and email clients in our experiments only display the "From" header without any additional authentication details. This makes it challenging for ordinary users to judge the authenticity of emails. Some visual attacks, such as A12 and A13, cannot be defended against at the protocol level. An effective defense is to provide user-friendly UI notifications that alert users about potential spoofing emails. Hu et al. [20] demonstrated that a well-designed visual security notification can positively impact the mitigation of phishing email threats in real-world scenarios. As shown in Figure 4, the spoofing email in Section 5 can be verified by all three email protocols. However, without a UI notification, users cannot distinguish this spoofing email from normal emails.

Figure 16 illustrates how users can intuitively recognize whether a received email contains malicious behavior based on the UI notification. Coremail, a prominent email service provider in China, has implemented our suggestions and introduced UI notifications in its webmail and email client. Additionally, we have released a Chrome extension called "NoSpoofing" for Gmail, which provides similar UI notifications.

### Evaluation Tools
We have publicly released our testing tool on GitHub to help email administrators evaluate and improve their security. After configuring the target email system information, the tool can interact with the target system and assess its vulnerability to various attacks.

### Disclosure and Response
The vulnerabilities identified in this work have been reported to all 30 relevant email vendors. Our contact results are summarized below:

- **Alibaba Cloud**: They expressed interest in the attacks and had an in-depth discussion with us. They mentioned that RFC 6376 suggests adding a DKIM signature during email forwarding to increase credibility. They now recognize the risk of adding DKIM signatures without verification and promise to evaluate and fix these issues. They also suggested contacting the authors of related RFCs to reach a consensus on a fix.
  
- **Gmail**: They acknowledged our report and will address the issues in subsequent updates. They contacted us to discuss the underlying reasons behind these security issues.
  
- **iCloud**: They discussed the attack details and potential consequences. Apple iCloud Email has already fixed related security issues with our cooperation.
  
- **Sina**: They evaluated the issue as a high-risk vulnerability and assessed corresponding protective measures internally. They provided a reward of approximately $90.
  
- **Yandex**: They accepted our report, confirmed the vulnerability, and provided a bonus of $200 as appreciation.
  
- **Yahoo**: They confirmed the vulnerability but claimed it is not an immediate risk.
  
- **Coremail**: They acknowledged our report and thanked us for reporting the UI attack issue. They adopted our suggestions and started implementing UI notifications to protect users against email spoofing attacks.
  
- **QQ Mail and 163.com**: They appreciated our work and informed us that they would fix these security issues using anti-spam strategies.
  
- **Outlook and Mail.ru**: They stated that they strictly follow RFC standards and categorize these problems as phishing emails. They promised to pay more attention to the impact of such attacks.
  
- **Others**: We have contacted other relevant email vendors and are awaiting their feedback.

### Related Work
Previous studies have highlighted the threats posed by phishing email attacks [8,12], including the impact of spear phishing on user behavior [32]. Our work focuses on novel forms of spoofing attacks and their influence on the entire authentication process. Poddebniak et al. [37] discussed how practical spoofing attacks can break various protections of OpenPGP and S/MIME email signature verification. They also proposed two new protocols, BIMI (Brand Indicators for Message Identification) [41] and ARC (Authenticated Received Chain) [3], to enhance spoofing detection. However, BIMI is built on DMARC and has not been fully standardized, making it vulnerable to the attacks we found. The ARC protocol, standardized in 2019, has been deployed by only three vendors (Gmail, Office 365, Zoho). Our work found that both Office 365 and Zoho have flaws in their ARC implementation, leading to security issues.

Hu et al. [20] analyzed how email vendors detect and handle spoofing emails through an end-to-end experiment. Most of the vulnerabilities they mentioned have been fixed in the past two years. However, they did not discuss bypassing security protocols. Our work focuses on new attacks that can bypass security protocols or user-interface protections, constructing highly realistic spoofing emails that can completely evade all email security protocols and user-interface protections.

### Conclusion
This paper explored the vulnerabilities in the chain-based authentication structure of the email ecosystem. A failure in any part of this chain can compromise the entire authentication process. We presented a series of new attacks that can bypass SPF, DKIM, DMARC, and user-interface protections through a systematic analysis of the email delivery process. We conducted a large-scale analysis of 30 popular email services and 23 email clients, finding that all of them are vulnerable to these new attacks, including well-known services like Gmail and Outlook. We emphasized the unfortunate fact that many email services have not implemented adequate protective measures. Recognizing the limitations of past literature, which focused on the impact of spoofing attacks on a single step of the authentication process, we concentrated on the overall influence of spoofing attacks on the chain-based email authentication process.

Based on our findings, we analyzed the root causes of these attacks and reported the issues to the corresponding email service providers. We also proposed key mitigating measures for email protocol designers and providers to defend against email spoofing attacks. Our work aims to help the email industry more effectively protect users and improve the overall security of the email ecosystem.
