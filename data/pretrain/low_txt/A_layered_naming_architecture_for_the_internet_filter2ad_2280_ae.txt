### Optimized Text

Only at the lowest logical layer, thereby minimizing the extent to which the routing infrastructure constrains the protocols and applications above it. For a variety of reasons, including address exhaustion, security threats, and the need for efficient content delivery, there is an apparent and seemingly irreversible trend toward interposing functionality between communicating Internet endpoints. Currently, such functionality is implemented via middleboxes, which are often criticized for violating the architectural principles and reducing the Internet's flexibility.

Our third key message is that these adverse effects need not be inevitable. The concept of delegation, in which such functionality is explicitly invoked by the endpoints, allows for interposition without violating the spirit of the end-to-end principle or the semantics of IP. Thus, intermediaries can retain the desired architectural purity and application flexibility while achieving the goals of middleboxes.

Of course, our proposal faces significant challenges. Incorporating new naming layers requires substantial changes to host software, both at the application and protocol levels. Resolving these flat names also necessitates a new resolution infrastructure. We do not underestimate the difficulty of making these changes; they are indeed massive challenges. However, both changes can be implemented incrementally. Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) can be scaled incrementally, so in the early stages, when there are few clients, the resolution infrastructure can be small. As demand grows, the size of the DHT can expand accordingly. Host software can also be deployed incrementally; early adopters will benefit significantly, and they can remain backward-compatible with the old architecture for a long time. While we do not mean to imply that deployment will be easy, it is not impossible. This, unfortunately, is the best one can hope for.
