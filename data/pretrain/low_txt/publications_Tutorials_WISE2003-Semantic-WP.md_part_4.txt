# Web Services and Processes: Quality of Service (QoS) Management

## Introduction
### Why QoS?
- **Purpose**: To select the most suitable service for carrying out an activity in a process.
- **Reference**: [Cardoso and Sheth, 2002]

## Benefits of QoS
- **Process Composition**: Align processes with QoS objectives and requirements.
- **Selection and Execution**: Choose and execute processes based on QoS metrics.
- **Monitoring**: Ensure compliance with initial QoS requirements.
- **Evaluation**: Assess alternative strategies when QoS requirements are violated.

## Research Issues in Semantic WP QoS
- **Specification**: What dimensions should be included in the QoS model for processes?
- **Computation**: What methods and algorithms can be used to compute, analyze, and predict QoS?
- **Monitoring**: What kind of QoS monitoring tools need to be developed?
- **Control**: What mechanisms need to be developed to control processes in response to unsatisfactory QoS metrics?

## QoS Specification for Web Services
- **Operational Metrics**: Described using a QoS model represented with a suitable ontology.
- **Web Process QoS**: Allows the analysis and computation of process QoS, enabling organizations to translate their strategies into processes more efficiently.

## Dimensions of QoS Models
- **Time**
- **Cost**
- **Price**
- **Fidelity**
- **Duration**
- **Reliability**
- **Repudiation**
- **Availability**

## QoS Models and Semantics
- **Use of Semantics**: Enhances the understanding and application of QoS models.
- **Dimensions**:
  - Time
  - Cost
  - Price
  - Fidelity
  - Duration
  - Security
  - Reliability
  - Repudiation
  - Availability

## QoS in METEOR-S
- **Design**: QoS Model and estimates for tasks and transitions.
- **Computation**: Using stochastic processes and simulation.
- **Enactment**: Simulation and logging for process QoS analysis.

## Creation of QoS Estimates
- **Task QoS Metrics**: Estimate QoS metrics for tasks.
- **Transition Probabilities**: Estimate transition probabilities.
- **Simulation**: Apply algorithms and mechanisms to compute the overall QoS of a process.

## QoS Computation Techniques
- **Graph Reduction**: For sequential and parallel systems.
- **Simulation**: Utilize simulation analysis to tune QoS metrics by exploring "what-if" questions.

## METEOR-S Project @ LSDIS Lab
- **Technologies**: Workflow, Semantic Web, Web Services, and Simulation.
- **Challenges**: Addressed in a practical and standards-based approach.
- **Semantics**: Applied in annotation, QoS, discovery, composition, and execution of web services.
- **Ontologies**: Provide underpinning for information sharing and semantic interoperability.

## METEOR-S Components for Semantic Web Services
- **Discovery Infrastructure (MWSDI)**: Semantic annotation and discovery of web services.
- **Composer**: Service Composition and Execution Tool (SCET), QoS management.
- **Orchestrator**: Under development, includes analysis, simulation, execution, and monitoring.

## Ongoing Projects
- **SWAP**: Combines Semantic Web and P2P for effective knowledge sharing.
- **WonderWeb**: Develops frameworks and methodologies for building and using ontologies.
- **DAML-S**: Set of ontologies to describe functionalities of web services.
- **DAML-S Matchmaker**: Matches service requestors with service providers.
- **Web Service Composer**: Semi-automatic process for dynamic composition of web services.

## Conclusions
- **Semantic Web Service Annotation and Discovery**: Data, functional, and QoS semantics.
- **Web Processes vs. Semantic Web Processes**: BPEL4WS vs. DAML-S.
- **Web Process Composition**: Based on data, functional, and QoS similarity.
- **QoS Computation**: Models, techniques, and algorithms.
- **Challenges in Process Composition**: Static discovery, design-time binding, and interface-based composition.
- **Proposition**: Semantics as an enabler to address scalability, heterogeneity, and machine understandability.
