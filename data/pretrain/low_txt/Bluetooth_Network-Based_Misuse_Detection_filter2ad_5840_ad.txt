### Evaluation of Response Capability

#### 7.4.1 Reconnaissance Response

Honeypots have been effectively used to distract attackers from IP targets [42]. This section describes the results of using honeypots to distract mobile attackers on the Bluetooth protocol. One advantage of Bluetooth attacks over typical wireless attacks is the relatively quick time in which an attacker can find and compromise a target. The following results present the success of one method of aggressively responding to a reconnaissance threat by flooding the attacker with false honeypot targets, thereby increasing the time required for an attacker to find a target device.

To confuse the attacker, the IDS employed the following technique: upon notification of a reconnaissance probe, the system deployed three Bluetooth radios that constantly changed their user-friendly names and physical MAC addresses. This created the illusion of a large volume of Bluetooth targets. To achieve this, the system flashed the chipsets of each Bluetooth radio. On average, it took 5.7947 seconds to flash the chipset, reboot the chip, and change the device name after responding to an inquiry. Thus, the system essentially created ten false targets per radio per minute.

To verify these results, the authors developed a reconnaissance program that recorded the names of unique targets detected per minute. On average, the inquiry program detected only 4 false targets per additional radio per minute. This lower value corresponds to an inquiry period of 10.24 seconds plus the short period during which an attacker must ask for the user-friendly name of the Bluetooth device. At a cost of $3 per Bluetooth radio, a production system could easily employ hundreds of Bluetooth radios to quickly distract an attacker. Furthermore, these radios could be placed throughout an organization to distract attackers.

#### 7.4.2 Denial of Service Responses

The authors further tested the IDS response system by attempting to break ongoing denial of service (DoS) attacks using falsified connection termination messages [15]. To utilize this attack method, the attacker must know both the physical addresses of the attacker (master) and the target device (slave) in the piconet. The system already had knowledge of the master address from discovery by the protocol analyzer. If the system had been implemented differently, the master address would also have been available as a field in the FHS packet sent at the start of the connection. However, gaining access to the target address proved more challenging. The packet header only includes a 3-bit AMA address referring to the slave’s position in the piconet. Thus, the response node had to scan for all discoverable devices and then forge packets from all of those devices to the attacker.

The system then attempted to stop an attacker using the BlueSmack Attack. The system successfully terminated the DoS attack. At the attacker’s console, the DoS program reported a connection timeout and disconnected from the target, stopping the attack. Further testing showed that the response capability disrupted similar attacks such as Tanya, Ping of Death, and Symbian Remote Restart attacks.

#### 7.4.3 Information Theft Responses

Next, the authors tested the system's ability to respond to information theft attacks such as BlueSnarf, BlueBug, CarWhisperer, and HeloMoto by establishing false targets. Establishing false targets protects vulnerable devices by creating phony devices with the same physical address as the vulnerable target.

To test the defense, the authors flashed a radio with the same physical address as a vulnerable device and then attempted to perform an attack against the vulnerable device. Because the flashed device had a higher power class, it answered and generated replies for the traffic intended for the vulnerable target, causing the attack to fail for all four attack methods. The more powerful phony-target-response device responded to the message instead of the intended target. Based on the success of this test, the implemented system could be further expanded by creating phony services that supplied false information to attackers. However, this method of response has the limitation of potentially causing a denial of service attack in the process.

### 8. Conclusion

Bluetooth is becoming a ubiquitous protocol, with applications ranging from smartphones, hands-free audio, global positioning devices, cameras, and peripheral cable replacement to health care, mobile banking, and military applications. Bluetooth-enabled devices now carry sensitive information, attracting hackers.

The lack of mandatory authentication, a weak encryption key scheme, and differing vendor protocol implementations have created the possibility for several attacks on Bluetooth devices. Recent trends show an increase in attacks on Bluetooth-enabled devices and the combination of other attacks implemented over Bluetooth. Furthermore, the ease of implementing Bluetooth attacks has decreased with the proliferation of several tools and online repositories of information.

This paper presents a network intrusion detection system (IDS) based on misuse detection to detect Bluetooth attacks. While this system has the limitation of all misuse detection schemes—namely, the inability to automatically recognize new categories of attacks—it provides an efficient and effective means of detecting known intrusions. Furthermore, the system demonstrates the ability to determine the success of an attack and is resistant to attacks on the IDS itself.

This work demonstrates that a Bluetooth IDS can actively respond to threats. It presents a means to distract attackers via the use of a mirage of Bluetooth devices and implements a system for stopping ongoing attacks through specially crafted messages.

**Limitations of the work and possible future directions include:**

1. **Inability to automatically recognize new classes of attacks:** The potential of anomaly detection for Bluetooth remains to be investigated.
2. **Fusing data from IDS sensors on different piconets:** This might provide a broader view of attack strategies.
3. **Identifying the geographic location of the attacker:** Using the technique of Rodriguez et al. [44] might be possible, providing a wider scope for effective intrusion responses.
4. **Integration of the IDS with other Bluetooth security assessment tool suites.**
