### Appendices

#### A. Initial Interview Script

**Control and Agency**
- Who found out about the study? Who wanted to be a part of it?
- Did you set up your smart home together, or did one person take the lead?
- Do all of you have access to all smart home devices right now? If not, why?
- What are you hoping that your smart home will do for you?

**Multi-user Privacy**
- Have you ever unexpectedly learned anything about someone else through the smart home?
- Can you think of ways you could “spy” on people using your smart home? Would you do it?
- Do you think it’s a good or bad thing that you can find out those things?

**Transparency**
- Are you having any trouble figuring out how to control your devices? Or figuring out which devices are smart?
- Has there been any confusing moments where you weren’t sure what was causing something to happen in your home? How did you figure it out?

**Access Control Preferences**
- Can you think of any situations where you want to restrict where people could remotely control devices from?
- Can you think of any situations where you want to restrict certain people from controlling certain devices?

**General Security and Privacy Questions**
- Do you have any security and privacy concerns about smart homes?
- Are there any potential security and privacy issues that you are aware of, but aren’t worried about?

#### B. Exit Interview Script

**General Usage and Control**
- How did you end up using your new devices?
- Did you set up any automations?
- How involved were each of you in configuring the home? Like setting up rooms and permissions?

**Notifications and Transparency**
- Let’s talk about the activity notifications feature - the notifications you can get when someone turns something on or off, or trips one of your sensors. Did you have this feature on? (Why not?)
- How did you set your preferences for notifications?
- In what situations did you normally see notifications?
- Did seeing notifications provide any useful or interesting information?
- Did any notifications help you understand what your smart home was doing?
- Did you learn something about other people’s behavior that you wouldn’t have found out about without notifications?
- Did you change your behavior in your home because of the notifications?
- Were the notifications overwhelming, or not useful?
- What changes would you like made to make to this feature?
- Leaving aside the particular capabilities of our app, can you think of any situation where it would be useful to get notifications, maybe just for particular devices?

**Supervisory, Reactive, and Role-based Access Control**
- Let’s move onto the allowed users feature. This is the feature that lets you designate owners for each device, and have everyone else ask for permission to use it. Did you use this feature?
- If so, who was restricted? What devices and policies did you set? (block, ask, ask if not nearby)
- If not, why?
- How did you all decide on who to set restrictions on?
- In what situations did [user] have to ask for permission to use a device?
- Did anyone try to circumvent restrictions on them? How?
- To blocked user: was it clear to you which devices you needed permission to use? How did you find out?
- To blocked user: How comfortable did you feel pushing the button to ask for permission?
- To blocked user: Did you change your behavior as a result of having to ask for permission?
- To admin users: How did you feel when you got notifications when someone asked for permissions?
- To blocked user: when you asked for permission, did the other person usually respond in time?

**Location-based Access Control**
- Now let’s talk about permissions for remote control. This is the setting where you can make people ask for permission to use a device if they aren’t nearby. Were any devices restricted to remote control in a particular location? If not, why?
- How did you all decide on which devices to set restrictions on?
- In what situations did you have to ask for permission to use a device?
- Did anyone try to circumvent the restrictions on a device? How?
- When you had to ask for permission, did someone respond in time?
- When you got a permission request, did you receive a notification in a timely manner? Were you able to fulfill the request?
- Did the beacons usually accurately put you in the correct room?
- Was it clear which devices were location restricted? How did you know?
- To blocked user: How comfortable did you feel pushing the button to ask for permission?
- To blocked user: Did you change your behavior as a result of having to ask for permission?
- To admin users: How did you feel when you got notifications when someone asked for permissions?
- Did you ever use this feature to check who was home?
- What changes would you like made to make to this feature?
- Hypothetically, imagine we built an app that had every access control scheme and level of granularity you wanted - custom permission tiers, time-based access controls, proximity-based access controls, and device-level granularity. How would you set these for the different people who visit your home? (Spouse, children, guests, domestic workers?)
