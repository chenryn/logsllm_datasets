### Research on NFC and Online Mobile Wallet Payments

The adoption of Near Field Communication (NFC) for payment systems, such as those provided by major phone vendors like Google and Apple, has been widely studied [40, 41]. Additionally, research has been conducted on online mobile wallet payments [52, 12]. Both attack [37, 8, 9] and defense [18, 38, 47] mechanisms for NFC-based payments have been explored. However, these studies do not cover the specific type of attack we present in this paper, which we call the STLS attack. Due to its extremely short communication distance and the challenge-response based bidirectional communication pattern, NFC payments are not affected by the STLS attack.

### User Perception of Mobile Payment Techniques

User perception of emerging mobile payment techniques has also been a subject of investigation. Studies show that several factors can impede the adoption of mobile payment methods, including security, usability, and cost [32, 45, 19].

### Conclusion

In this paper, we introduce a new threat called STLS, which allows adversaries to attack off-line payment schemes by sniffing payment tokens, aborting current transactions, and using the stolen tokens at other locations. We have examined some leading off-line payment systems in real-world settings and demonstrated that such STLS attacks are entirely feasible. Our security analysis reveals significant limitations in existing token protection techniques. Unlike traditional payment systems with closed settings, off-line mobile payment solutions have a larger attack surface. Channels between smartphones and Point of Sale (POS) terminals are vulnerable to sniffing attacks. Communications between mobile POS and back-end servers, which are often built on WiFi or 3G/4G networks, can be disrupted. More importantly, most token delivery channels are one-way, making it impossible to bind tokens to the POS terminal of the current transaction. Shortening the token validity period alone is insufficient to ensure adequate payment security.

To mitigate STLS threats, we propose POSAUTH, a solution that forces a payment token to include the unique ID of the current POS terminal. When combined with a short validity period, this approach confines the token to legitimate transactions only. In the future, we plan to collaborate with merchants to deploy POSAUTH in real-world POS systems.
