As noted in issue #12076, the `Getpagesize` function currently returns a hard-coded value instead of the system's actual default page size. Following a discussion with @ianlancetaylor on the golang-dev mailing list [1], it was agreed that `syscall.Getpagesize` should return the same value as the POSIX call `sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE)`. This change is necessary for future platform support, particularly on Solaris.

Although this modification could potentially be applied to all other POSIX-compliant platforms, I am initially focusing on implementing it for Solaris. This issue has been created to track the changes separately from the `x/sys/unix` package and specifically for the `golang/go` repository.

While this issue may seem related to #10180, I believe it can be resolved independently.
