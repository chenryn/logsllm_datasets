### Abstract
Network fault prediction, a field that has been active for over three decades, has seen a significant increase in scientific interest in recent years. The ability to predict network equipment failures is increasingly recognized as an effective tool for enhancing network reliability. This predictive capability can be used to either mitigate impending network failures or to perform preventive maintenance, potentially enabling the emergence of zero-failure networks. Such advancements could allow safety-critical applications to run on larger, more complex heterogeneous networks. After defining key terms and describing the core concepts of network fault prediction, this article provides performance parameters from a specific network and systems integrator's current operations in network maintenance. It also describes the machine learning methods used for network fault prediction and surveys recent research applications in the field. Finally, the article outlines perspectives for future research.
