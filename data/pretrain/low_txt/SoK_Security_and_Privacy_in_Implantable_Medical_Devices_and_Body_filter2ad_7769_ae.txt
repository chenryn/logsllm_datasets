### C. Emerging Threats: Sensors, Remote Attacks, and Privacy

#### 1. Traditional Assumptions and Recent Findings
Traditionally, it has been assumed that physiological signals from Implantable Medical Devices (IMDs) and Body Area Networks (BANs) remain within the patient's body, thereby limiting data exfiltration and the possibility of signal injection attacks. However, recent studies have shown that both data exfiltration and signal injection are possible.

#### 2. Electromagnetic Interference and Active Attackers
To date, the design constraints of IMDs have primarily focused on mitigating accidental electromagnetic interference (EMI). However, they do not adequately address the threat posed by active attackers. For instance, research by Foo Kune et al. [22] demonstrates that EMI at a Cardiac Implantable Electronic Device (CIED) sensor interface can be used to inject a signal mimicking a cardiac waveform. This theoretical attack could alter the therapy delivered by the CIED, although the current range of such an attack is very limited (a few centimeters).

The reliance on sensor readings for accurate and timely actuation, combined with increasingly sophisticated attacks, underscores the need to carefully consider adversarial capabilities and to develop trustworthy systems.

#### 3. Security and Privacy Implications
If the assumption that certain physiological signals remain within the human body is incorrect, both the security and privacy of these devices may be compromised. For example, using physiological values as a source of entropy in key agreement schemes relies on the assumption that an adversary cannot observe the given biometric. Current literature often assumes that the adversary cannot make physical contact with the target patient. In this context, protocols that use physiological values to generate a shared key can be viewed as body-coupled communication protocols, where the key is transmitted via the human body.

While the assumption that an adversary does not have physical contact holds merit in practice, it neglects subtle classes of attacks by individuals known to the victim. New technologies should not enable "perfect crime" scenarios, even for the most sophisticated attackers.

As more people become active participants in potentially insecure BANs, it may be possible for someone close to the victim (i.e., with physical contact) to inadvertently aid a remote attacker, either by leaking patient biometrics or performing signal injection attacks on sensors or wireless telemetry.

#### 4. Remote Sensing and Physiological Values
Remote attackers also pose a significant concern, especially regarding the observation of physiological values assumed to be secret. Rostami et al. [45] and Chang et al. [52] recognize the need to consider remote sensing of Intrinsic Physiological Information (IPI). Although Rostami et al. failed to replicate the results of Poh et al. [98] on the correlation between color fluctuations and IPI, other recent work [99], [100] indicates that such attacks warrant further attention.

Recent results from Bagade et al. [23] show that ECG data from one person may be observable from another person's physiological signals if the two are in physical contact. Specifically, if two individuals touch, the ECG of one person can be coupled to the EEG of the other. This suggests that while the use of ECG (and other physiological values) as a security mechanism holds promise, more rigorous cryptanalysis and entropy assessments are needed.

#### 5. Neurostimulators and Brain-Computer Interfaces
Another area of research is the study of neurostimulators, which are IMDs designed to send electrical pulses to the nervous system, including the brain. These devices are used to treat conditions such as epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, with ongoing human trials exploring their efficacy in treating severe depression. Very little computer security and privacy research has been completed on these devices, and as the technology progresses, the need for further work in this area becomes more pressing. Denning et al. [66] provide a brief overview of potential security and privacy implications, but concrete results are still lacking.

Martinovic et al. [55] explore a related question in the context of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), which measure and respond dynamically to a user’s brain activities, allowing communication without words or gestures. Their preliminary results support the hypothesis that personal information, such as passwords and whether a particular person is known to the target, may unintentionally leak through BCI use.

### VII. Concluding Remarks

In this paper, we have provided a comprehensive narrative of security and privacy research in IMDs and BANs, analyzing current and emerging trends. Our analysis in Section V-A shows that much attention has been paid to securing the telemetry interface, with many useful approaches developed. We have identified several areas for future work, such as the need for a more rigorous assessment of the use of physiological values as a source of entropy for cryptographic keys.

As discussed in Section V-B, the increasing complexity of software in IMDs and the history of FDA software-related recalls highlight the need for ensuring the trustworthiness of IMD and BAN software. The possibility of EMI attacks on the sensor interface and eavesdropping on physiological signals previously thought to be private indicates the need for a more nuanced approach to security and privacy research for medical devices.

Computing devices that interface with the brain are becoming more advanced and popular, both in entertainment (e.g., BCI-integrated gaming) and healthcare (e.g., neurostimulators). The ability to record and analyze brainwaves in real time using implanted computing devices that alter the brain’s functionality has far-reaching implications for security and privacy, moving well beyond traditional treatment in computer security.
