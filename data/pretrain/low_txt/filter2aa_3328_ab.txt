# Kiosk Security Threats and Hacking Techniques

## Introduction
The most obvious security threat to kiosks is the opportunistic hacker, who may have an 8-hour stopover and attempt to exploit the system. A common oversight in kiosk security models is the lack of consideration for remote websites, which are often trusted more than local kiosk users. Kiosks typically rely on browser control security settings, which are designed to protect users from malicious websites but are not tailored for kiosk terminals.

## Hacking Kiosk Software
### Available Remote Input Vectors
- **Remotely hosted content**: Content viewed by a kiosk.
- **JavaScript**
- **Java Applets**
- **ActiveX**
- **ClickOnce applications** (.NET Online Application Deployment)
- **Internet Zone protocol handlers**
- **File type handlers**
- **Browser plug-ins**: Flash, Director, Windows Media Player, Real, QuickTime, Acrobat, etc.

Increased functionality often results in a larger attack surface, making kiosks more vulnerable to attacks.

### iKAT â€“ Interactive Kiosk Attack Tool
iKAT is an online tool designed to help escape from application jails during penetration tests. It can be accessed from any kiosk terminal.

#### What Can iKAT Do?
- **Kiosk Reconnaissance**:
  - **JavaScript & res:// (resource) protocol handler**: Extract bitmap resources from PE executables and verify their existence.
  - **Detect common commercial kiosk products**.

- **Display Local Browser Variables**:
  - Determine the underlying browser technology (e.g., MSINET.OCX, WINHTTP.DLL self-identify as Internet Explorer).
  - Detect the presence of .NET.

- **Display Remote Server Variables**:
  - Discover the remote IP address of the kiosk terminal.
  - Detect additional headers in requests (e.g., "Kiosk-Location: Terminal5").

- **Invoke Dialogs with JavaScript/HTML**:
  - **File Browse**
  - **File Save As**: `javascript:document.execCommand("SaveAs");`
  - **File Print**: `javascript:window.print();` (can invoke "Print to File" and file/open dialog)
  - **Invoke File Print Preview ActiveX**

- **Use Flash to Create Common Dialogs**:
  - Adobe Flash is widely used and typically installed.
  - **DownloadCmd.SWF**: Downloads `cmd.exe` to disk.
  - Creates file-view dialogs with unique titles, bypassing standard blacklists.

- **Spawning Applications**:
  - Launch applications or processes that may contain common dialogs and provide additional access to the host.
  - **Default Windows URI Handlers**: `callto://`, `gopher://`, `hcp://`, `telnet://`, `tn3270://`, `rlogin://`, `ldap://`, `news://`, `mailto://`
  - **Third-party URI Handlers**: `mms://`, `skype://`, `sip://`, `play://`, `steam://`, `quicktime://`

- **Example: HCP:// Help and Support Center**:
  - Click to search HCP for specific content (e.g., "Using Notepad" to spawn `notepad.exe`).

- **Pluggable Protocol Handlers**:
  - Contains URLs for pluggable protocols like `about:`, `res:`, `shell:`.

- **Invoke Applications Using File Type Handlers**:
  - Click on test files (e.g., `test.myfile`) to spawn the associated handler.
  - Example: Click `test.wmv` to launch Windows Media Player without a prompt.

- **iKAT Windows Media Files**:
  - Prompt-less launching of `wmplayer.exe` for multiple file types.
  - Web-enabled playlist to create a clean web browser inside Windows Media Player.

- **Embed Executables Within Office Documents**:
  - Embed `cmd.exe` within an Office document (supported by `.DOC`, `.DOCX`, `.XLS`, `.XLSB`, `.XLSM`, `.XLSX`).

- **Malicious Java Applets**:
  - Signed Java applets can execute local processes.
  - Detect JRE installation using the resource protocol.
  - iKAT contains signed kiosk-specific Java applets to spawn command shells and execute binaries (e.g., Jython).

- **Malicious ActiveX**:
  - Safe-for-scripting ActiveX can be used to compromise a kiosk.
  - Execute `cmd.exe` if administrative permissions are available.
  - Note: Internet Explorer 8 does not require admin rights for ActiveX.

- **Malicious ClickOnce Applications**:
  - Supports online application deployment (requires .NET 2.0/3.0 runtime).
  - Administrative authority not required to run.
  - Creates a security prompt with a unique title.
  - Modern kiosk software developed in .NET (CLR is present).
  - Very powerful attack vector; if .NET is installed, the attacker wins.

- **iKAT - Embedded Web Browser**:
  - ClickOnce embedded browser control to create a browser with fewer restrictions.
  - **Application Executor**: Spawns over 50 native Windows applications.
  - **Token Pincher**: Impersonates privileged tokens if the kiosk user has the `SeImpersonate` privilege.

- **Crashing the Kiosk**:
  - **Emo-Kiosking**: Create an unhandled exception in the kiosk browser to crash it.
  - Rare situation, but a highly critical vulnerability.
  - iKAT contains common browser crash techniques.
  - **Crashing Browser Plug-ins**: Fuzzing .SWF (Flash) files to create reliable crash scenarios.

## Downloading Tools
- **Assume Something Worked**:
  - Access to the kiosk file system, command shell, common dialogs, Java installed, etc.
  - Download additional tools/binaries (e.g., Nmap, rootkit, `funnygame.exe`).

- **Downloading Files Using Native Windows Functionality**:
  - **Common Dialogs**: Attach a file from a remote resource (e.g., `http://www.a.com/test.exe`).
  - **Notepad as a Web Browser**: Use `File->Open` to download and save files.

- **iKAT Kiosk Hacking Tools**:
  - **Command Shells**: Unlocked `cmd.exe` (ignores `DisableCMD` registry key).
  - **Network Tools**: Netcat, GNU WGet, Nmap.
  - **Exploitation Aids**: Enable hidden or disabled Start bar, automatically spawn system applications, task manager, explorer, notepad, regedit, on-screen keyboard.
  - **Spawn a Command Shell Through Detours**: Tries 17 methods to invoke a console shell.

- **All Tools Available in 7Bit Safe VBScript**:
  - Download and copy/paste VBScript to use various command shells and detours.
