### Developing Feeder Models for High-Penetration Distribution Systems

Developing feeder models is crucial for the design, upgrade, and operation of distribution systems with high penetrations of rooftop photovoltaics (PV) and energy storage systems (ESS). These models help in managing the complexities introduced by distributed energy resources (DERs).

### Enhanced Use of AMI Deployments

Many utilities are exploring ways to better utilize Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) deployments by integrating them more effectively with other corporate functions and information management systems. For instance, some utilities did not initially anticipate the full benefits of using AMI data for outage management and power restoration. Consequently, these utilities are now planning to upgrade their Outage Management Systems (OMS) to fully integrate AMI systems and smart meter data.

### Scale of AMI Deployments

Almost half of the projects implemented AMI on a small scale (less than 20% of customers; 11 projects) or partial scale (20-90% of customers; 20 projects). Many of these utilities now plan to expand smart meter deployments to cover more customers and services. For example, PECO, a large investor-owned utility (IOU) in Pennsylvania, used Department of Energy (DOE) funds to deploy smart meters to about half of its customers and plans to extend this system-wide. Similarly, Westar Energy in Kansas intends to deploy an additional 200,000 smart meters over the next five years, building on the initial deployment of nearly 50,000 smart meters under the Smart Grid Investment Grant (SGIG) program.

### Advanced Communications Networks

The advanced communications networks deployed under SGIG form the backbone of not only smart grids but also future smart cities. Three municipal utilities, each offering both electricity and water services, adopted long-term, comprehensive smart grid strategies that included building communications networks with high capacities and bandwidth to handle future smart grid applications and other city services. These networks can be leveraged to provide additional customer services such as internet access, high-speed data access, and corporate intranets for companies with geographically dispersed facilities.

### Expanding AMI to Other Services

Several municipal utilities provide gas and water services in addition to electricity and plan to expand AMI to cover these other services while leveraging the communications network and Meter Data Management Systems (MDMS) built under SGIG. For example, Glendale Water & Power (GWP) and Burbank Water & Power (BWP) deployed smart water meters (outside the SGIG project) using the AMI communications network.

### Ongoing R&D Challenges

Advances in data analytics could help utilities extract additional benefits from the large volume of interval load data produced by AMI. Utilities require better data processing and management solutions, advanced software platforms, and improved models for assessing system conditions and predicting demand impacts and energy savings levels. Consistent data formats and more comprehensive interoperability standards are needed to achieve optimal levels of interoperability for smart meters, customer devices, and communications and information systems. Several utilities have indicated a desire to see these issues resolved before considering further investments in AMI and customer systems. The DOE supports ongoing efforts in these areas, including the Green Button Initiative, which provides a standard format for energy usage data now used by utilities and vendors serving more than 60 million businesses and households.

### Data Security and Privacy

AMI deployments raise new questions about the security of customer data, the types of entities that can access it, and how the data will be protected from cybersecurity breaches and other data privacy intrusions. The DOE supports the implementation of appropriate data privacy protections and participated in a collaborative process through the Voluntary Code of Conduct, which developed general principles for ensuring customer energy usage data privacy for utilities and third parties. Cybersecurity and interoperability remain important technical challenges for modernizing electric distribution systems. Standards, protocols, tools, and techniques are needed to ensure secure and interoperable technologies and systems.

### Opportunities for Grid-Friendly Devices

There are many opportunities to make smart appliances and building energy management equipment on the customer’s side of the meter more "grid-friendly." Proper characterization, improved interoperability, and new controls are required to enable the optimal coordination of electrical resources within buildings and industrial plants. Residential and commercial buildings, and industrial facilities, can be seen as energy ecosystems, consisting of power sources (DERs), loads (appliances and machines), storage (batteries and thermal energy), and controls (building energy management systems). However, communication and control capabilities among these assets are limited, and interoperability standards are yet to be developed. This results in numerous proprietary control and communication standards developed by independent manufacturers. Automated and grid-responsive equipment can be designed to detect voltage and frequency fluctuations or respond to signals from control systems, but challenges remain in ensuring that these devices can provide grid services without compromising their primary functions.

### Consumer Engagement and Education

Continued innovations in applications and tools that operate on mobile devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, and laptops) can help customers by providing consumption and cost data when and where they need it. The DOE supports innovations in devices and software for enhancing consumer engagement in Demand-Side Management (DSM) programs. Industry research by the Smart Grid Consumer Collaborative and other organizations indicates that the average consumer has limited knowledge about how electricity is generated, distributed, and consumed, and how to maximize efficiency and cost savings. The DOE participates in initiatives like Power over Energy, which helps industry participants engage and encourage consumers to become more active and informed participants in energy technologies, markets, and regulatory policy discussions.

### DOE's Role in Grid Modernization

The DOE expects to continue being an important contributor to grid modernization through research, development, demonstration, analysis, and technology transfer activities, especially in areas where there is a demonstrated federal role, such as cybersecurity, interoperability, and advanced concepts and technologies based on new discoveries in science, engineering, and mathematics. While the SGIG program is now complete, grid modernization remains a national priority. The DOE, through the Grid Modernization Initiative (GMI), recently released a Grid Modernization Multi-Year Program Plan (MYPP) that describes the challenges and opportunities for achieving a modern, secure, sustainable, and reliable grid and outlines how the DOE will help achieve this through various programs and activities. The Grid Modernization Lab Consortium, a multi-year collaboration among 14 DOE National Laboratories and regional networks, will assist the DOE in developing and implementing the activities outlined in the MYPP.

### Approach to Analysis and Data Collection

The 70 Smart Grid Investment Grant (SGIG) advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) and customer system projects collected and analyzed data about the deployed technologies and systems, grid impacts, benefits, and lessons learned. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) compiled this information for analysis of AMI and customer system operations and for sharing with the electric power industry through the DOE’s Smart Grid Investment Grant (SGIG) website. The primary purpose of SGIG’s data collection and analysis activities is to provide electric power industry decision-makers, both public and private, with information to help assess the cost-effectiveness of investments in AMI and customer systems, with the goal of accelerating the modernization of the nation’s electric distribution systems.

#### B.1. Analysis Approach

Figure B-1 shows the overall DOE approach for analyzing SGIG AMI and customer system projects. The analysis begins with assessments of the deployed smart grid assets, including technologies and systems such as smart meters and in-home displays, and how they can be installed and operated by the SGIG utilities, vendors, service providers, and participating customers. The next step involves assessments of the new smart grid functions enabled by these assets, such as remote connections/disconnections and demand management, and how to make them operational to achieve certain grid, customer, and societal impacts and benefits. The third step involves assessments of the smart grid impacts, which generally include the analysis of specific physical metrics that measure changes resulting from the deployment of assets and the implementation of functions to achieve improvements in operational efficiencies or reductions in peak demands. The final step involves the determination of smart grid benefits, which generally includes the monetization of the impacts for use in business case analysis, such as cost savings or deferral of capital investments.

#### B.2. Data Collection Approach

To conduct effective analysis of the SGIG AMI and customer system projects, accurate data is needed from the utilities on the performance of the deployed assets, functions, impacts, and benefits. At the outset of the SGIG program in 2009-2010, the DOE collaborated with each of the utility project teams to develop Metrics and Benefits Reporting Plans (MBRP). Each SGIG project was required to have an approved MBRP before equipment installations could begin. The MBRPs were customized to reflect each project’s unique scope and objectives and were developed through a series of meetings between the DOE and the project teams. The plans outlined the specific data to be collected and when and how it would be reported to the DOE. Each plan discussed two separate sets of data collection efforts: Build Metrics and Impact Metrics.

- **Build Metrics** comprise the set of devices and systems that the projects purchased and installed. This information was posted and updated on the SGIG website every six months to inform stakeholders of the progress of SGIG projects. AMI and customer system build metric data includes information on the numbers and costs of installed devices and systems.
- **Impact Metrics** comprise the set of information developed by the SGIG projects to assess the effects of the new technologies and systems on grid and customer operations and business practices. Impact Metric submissions to the DOE occurred twice a year and required the projects to collect and analyze information to show how the installed technologies and systems operated to achieve grid modernization objectives in several key areas: billing and metering services, demand management, revenue collections, voltage controls, and outage management.

The Impact Metric data submissions typically involved the utilities calculating quantitative values that showed the effects before and after, or without and with, the deployment and operation of AMI and customer systems. One of the challenges in estimating AMI and customer system impacts involves the need to develop accurate baselines (e.g., before AMI or without AMI) against which impacts can be measured.

#### B.3. Scope of Data Collection

Table B-1 lists the build metrics that were collected for the SGIG AMI and customer system projects. Because each of the projects had its own unique scope and objectives, not all of the SGIG AMI and customer system projects provided information on all of the build metrics in Table B-1.

**Table B-1. List of Key AMI and Customer System Build Metrics for SGIG Projects**
- **Smart meters**
- **AMI and backhaul communications systems**
- **Meter data management systems (MDMS)**
- **Customer information/billing systems**
- **Programmable communicating thermostats (PCT)**
- **Smart appliances**
- **Home area networks (HAN)**
- **Web portals**
- **Load control switches**
- **In-home displays (IHD)**

Table B-2 lists the impact metrics that were provided by the SGIG AMI and customer system projects. Because each of the projects had its own unique scope and objectives, not all of the projects provided information on all of the impact metrics in Table B-2. Additionally, the methods used by the projects to estimate impact metrics varied, so it was necessary for the DOE to categorize and analyze the data for presenting appropriate comparisons and information summaries.

#### B.4. Challenges and Limitations

The DOE’s data collection and analysis activities have produced a variety of reports and case studies on the results and lessons learned from the SGIG AMI and customer systems projects. The extent of the analysis is limited in various ways due to challenges that the SGIG AMI and customer systems projects faced during the data collection and analysis process.

One of the most significant challenges concerned the development of accurate baselines for assessing grid impacts. Most of the SGIG utilities encountered challenges in collecting and analyzing appropriate data for the development of accurate baselines. Many underestimated the amount of time, effort, engineering, and statistical expertise needed for accurate impact metric estimation and reporting. For example, some projects used control groups to assess before-and-after impacts from time-based rate and other demand response programs. This technique was complicated in many cases by the need to make randomized assignments of participating customers to treatment and control groups so that the causes of impacts on key metrics such as demand reductions could be determined to be the result of project activities versus other, potentially confounding factors such as differences in customer demographics. Some projects were successful in accomplishing randomized assignments for treatment and control groups, and the DOE’s analysis focused on the experiences and reported results from these.

Another challenge with AMI and customer system data collection and analysis concerned the lack of commonality among the projects in their respective goals and objectives. While many of the project’s smart meter deployments covered more than 90 percent of their systems, some conducted pilot-scale deployments on less than 20 percent of their systems. And, for customer systems, some devices (e.g., direct load control [DLC] devices and PCTs) were deployed widely, while others (e.g., IHDs and smart appliances) were deployed in relatively small numbers for testing and evaluations. Because of these differences, it is not productive to aggregate and analyze data for projects with such starkly different sets of objectives.

A final challenge concerned differences in the level of experience and expertise among the SGIG utilities with AMI and customer systems. In many cases, the technologies and systems involved learning curves to determine how to optimize new functions and capabilities properly. Projects that were primarily interested in learning generated fewer grid and customer impacts.

### Supporting Build Metrics Data

Build metrics data is provided in three tables: 1) customer device deployments; 2) smart meter deployments by customer type and features enabled, and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) integration with other systems; and 3) deployment of customer programs and time-based rates that were enabled by AMI.
