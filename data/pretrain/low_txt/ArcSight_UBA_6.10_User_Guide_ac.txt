#### Automated Response
- **Overview**: ArcSight UBA 6.10 provides the option to apply response orchestration to security violations through actionable playbooks. In ArcSight UBA, playbooks contain and describe the entire incident and response management lifecycle by combining automated tasks (e.g., gathering context on the violation and creating support tickets) with manual tasks the analyst must complete. Automated response reduces the time spent performing simple, repetitive tasks by automating incident triage activities and launching threat and case management functionality automatically.
- **Enable Playbooks**: You can enable playbooks to launch automated tasks automatically when a violation occurs, or you can manually launch playbook tasks from the violation summary screen in the Security Command Center. Playbooks are enabled when creating Policy Violations.
  - For more information about enabling playbooks, see the "Enabling Playbooks" section. For information about how playbooks are launched, see the "Launching Playbooks" section.

##### Automated Response Framework Integrations
- **Capabilities**:
  - Launch playbooks in response to different types of threats detected by ArcSight UBA.
  - Launch queries or actions on endpoints from the ArcSight UBA console in response to a threat.
  - Import critical UEBA alerts in CEF format from ArcSight UBA as incidents along with alerts from different security monitoring systems, and aggregate security alerts by user account into a Security Incident.
  - Check the reputation of IPs, domains, URLs, and files.
  - Verify if the email sender IP or domain is on a spam list.
  - Get WhoIs and DNS data, and check the validity of Certificates.
  - Launch a network vulnerability scan.

##### Available Playbook Actions
