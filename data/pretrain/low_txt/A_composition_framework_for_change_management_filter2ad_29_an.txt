### 2.3.1 Inputs

To effectively complete the Leadership Support activities in the Executing Process Phase, the OCM Practitioner must have a thorough understanding of the following inputs:

- **Stakeholder Register:** Developed in the Initiating Process Phase as per the CA-PMF, this register identifies the organizations, groups, and individuals involved in the project.
- **Stakeholder Management Plan:** Developed in the Planning Process Phase as per the CA-PMF, this plan outlines the processes, procedures, tools, and techniques for engaging stakeholders based on their needs, interests, and requirements.
- **Leadership Support Action Log:** Initially developed by the OCM Practitioner in the Initiating Process Phase, this log records all Leadership Support activities and tasks. It should be regularly updated and used throughout the PMLC.

### 2.3.2 Roles

The following table lists the roles and their associated responsibilities for those involved in Leadership Support activities during the Executing Process Phase:

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| OCM Practitioner | - Meet with mid-level managers and supervisors to identify strengths, questions, and possible concerns<br>- Identify additional actions to enroll managers and supervisors in the change initiative<br>- Coordinate with the Project Manager and Project Sponsor to identify additional actions if needed<br>- Maintain the Leadership Support Action Log |
| Project Manager | - Coordinate with the OCM Practitioner and Project Sponsor to identify additional actions if needed |
| Project Sponsor | - Coordinate with the OCM Practitioner and Project Manager to identify additional actions if needed |
| Mid-level Managers and Supervisors | - Participate in meetings with the OCM Practitioner to identify strengths, questions, and possible concerns |

### 2.3.3 Activities

As the project progresses through the PMLC, it is essential to involve leadership at all organizational levels. In addition to continuing previous process phase activities to support the Project Sponsor and executive leaders, the OCM Practitioner should focus on supporting mid-level management and supervisors during the Executing Process Phase.

**Support Managers and Supervisors:**

In the Planning Process Phase, the OCM Practitioner built leadership support for the change initiative by meeting with executive leaders to understand their engagement and support. This effort should continue in the Executing Process Phase, focusing on mid-level managers and supervisors identified in the Stakeholder Register and Stakeholder Management Plan. These leaders often serve as the bridge between employees and executive leadership. They can communicate directly with employees, gauge their support, and identify and mitigate resistance.

The OCM Practitioner should meet with managers and supervisors, individually or in small focus groups, to:
- Foster in-depth connections between the OCM Practitioner and the managers and supervisors.
- Encourage thought among managers and supervisors about what is required for a successful change initiative and their role.
- Build the OCM Practitioner’s understanding of the organizational change at the manager/supervisor level to help the project team navigate political issues and struggles.

The OCM Practitioner can use the Executive Interview Guide, also used in the Planning Process Phase, to guide discussions with managers and supervisors. This guide covers general background information, prior experience with change, the organization’s vision and strategy, and political environment and team dynamics. It is an informal working document that should be kept confidential due to the sensitive nature of the information collected.

**Skills:**
- Coaching
- Interviewing

**Inputs:**
- Stakeholder Register
- Stakeholder Management Plan

**Tools:**
- Executive Interview Guide Template

**Outputs:**
- Completed Manager and Supervisor Interviews

Once the interviews or focus groups are conducted, the data should be compiled to identify main strengths, questions, and possible concerns. The OCM Practitioner should assess these aspects individually and for the group as a whole. This will help in building on identified strengths, researching questions, and identifying actions to address possible problems. One such action may include requesting the assistance of the Project Sponsor or other executive leaders to address concerns by meeting personally with managers and supervisors or having a broader discussion with the group.

The OCM Practitioner should use the Leadership Support Action Log to record all Leadership Support actions. This working document, initially developed in the Initiating Process Phase, tracks all Leadership Support activities and tasks.

### 2.3.4 Tools

The tools the OCM Practitioner will use within the Leadership Support Knowledge Area during the Executing Process Phase include:
- Executive Interview Guide Template
- Leadership Support Action Log Template

### 2.3.5 Outputs

**Figure 2-7: Team Dynamics in the Executing Process Phase**

In the Executing Process Phase, the OCM Practitioner focuses on monitoring team dynamics as the project team expands to include additional resources. It is important to introduce, review, and discuss team behavior guidelines to maintain a cohesive team and positive working environment. Team Dynamics activities, including surveys and sessions, build on the initial team behavior guidelines session conducted in the Planning Process Phase to keep the guidelines at the forefront of the team’s consciousness. This cycle of assessment and discussion creates and maintains a constructive environment.

### 2.4.1 Inputs

To complete the Team Dynamics activities in the Executing Process Phase, the OCM Practitioner will need a thorough knowledge of the following inputs:

- **Team Guidelines:** Developed in the Initiating Process Phase by the OCM Practitioner and Project Manager, these guidelines define the behaviors expected of all project team members. They form the foundation for all team interactions, both within the team and with outside resources.
- **Team Dynamics Action Log:** Created in the Planning Process Phase by the OCM Practitioner, this log provides an account of all Team Dynamics activities, responsible resources, and timelines that have occurred in the Initiating and Planning phases. This informal working document keeps an ongoing record of all knowledge area activities and should be updated throughout the Executing Process Phase as needed.

### 2.4.2 Roles

The following table lists the roles and their associated responsibilities for those involved in Team Dynamics activities during the Executing Process Phase:

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| OCM Practitioner | - Conduct Team Guidelines and Team Effectiveness Surveys<br>- Analyze survey results<br>- In collaboration with the Project Manager, conduct Team Guidelines sessions<br>- Monitor team dynamics<br>- Adhere to Team Guidelines<br>- Maintain the Team Dynamics Action Log |

| Project Team | - Complete Team Guidelines Surveys<br>- Participate in Team Guidelines sessions<br>- Monitor team dynamics<br>- Adhere to Team Guidelines |

### 2.4.3 Activities

Team Dynamics serves to create and maintain a positive working environment for the project team throughout the Executing Process Phase. The Team Dynamics Knowledge Area builds on the foundation established in earlier process phases by conducting Team Guidelines and Team Effectiveness Surveys and follow-up sessions.

**Conduct Team Guidelines and Team Effectiveness Surveys and Follow-Up Sessions:**

In the Planning Process Phase, the Project Manager introduced and reinforced the need for team guidelines. During the Executing Process Phase, the OCM Practitioner will continue to work with the Project Manager to assess the project team’s adoption of all guidelines. The OCM Practitioner may use the Team Guidelines Survey, which asks team members’ opinions on how the entire team is performing the guidelines. The survey consists of a statement for each team guideline that project team members can rank on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).

The OCM Practitioner should have all team members complete the survey to gather as much data as possible. An additional resource is the Team Effectiveness Survey, which allows project team members to rate the effectiveness of the project team in eight categories: goals, participation, feelings, problem solving, leadership, decision making, trust, and creativity and growth. Both surveys provide input into addressing any team dynamics concerns. While the Team Guidelines Survey and Team Effectiveness Survey were developed as two separate templates, the OCM Practitioner may find it beneficial to combine the surveys to gain a complete picture without overloading the project team with surveys.

Once the OCM Practitioner compiles the data from the surveys, he/she should assess the results, looking for team guidelines or categories that scored the lowest and thus need the highest amount of effort to correct. The OCM Practitioner should share the overall results with the Project Manager and project team to facilitate a follow-up session to discuss team guidelines and next steps. The OCM Practitioner, Project Manager, and project team should consider the following questions during the follow-up sessions:
- How do the team guidelines impact the team’s effectiveness?
- If a team guideline is performed well, what does it look like?
- Which guidelines need improvement?
- What are the consequences for not performing a team guideline well?
- What steps can the team take to improve a specific team guideline?
- How will team members communicate if a guideline is not being practiced?
- Why should team members make an effort to change their behavior?
- How will the team know when they are successfully practicing a guideline?

The OCM Practitioner and Project Manager may utilize the Team Guidelines Survey, Team Effectiveness Survey, and subsequent follow-up sessions multiple times throughout the Executing Process Phase as checkpoints and course corrections. These assessments provide a useful tool for new and existing team members to review the team guidelines and identify areas that may need improvement.

Throughout the Executing Process Phase, the OCM Practitioner should use the Team Dynamics Action Log, initially developed during the Planning Process Phase, to record and track all Team Dynamics activities. The log, initially created in the Initiating Process Phase, provides a record of all Team Dynamics activities for the Project Manager to review and allows for a smooth transition of responsibilities if there is a change in the OCM Practitioner or Project Manager role.
