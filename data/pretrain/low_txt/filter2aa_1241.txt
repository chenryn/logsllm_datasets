#### Current Events
**Revolutions:**
- **Egypt / Middle-East:**
  - Orchestrated via social networks

**Natural Disasters:**
- Tōhoku Earthquake and Tsunami
- Hurricane Katrina

#### Impact of Telecommunication Loss
- **Loss of Life**
- **Limits Response by Emergency Services**
- **Disruption of Organized Events**
- **Economic Loss**

We need an alternative method of communication to mitigate these issues.

**Quote:**
"During Hurricane Katrina, people could not communicate. It got to the point that people were literally writing messages on paper, putting them in bottles, and dropping them from helicopters to other people on the ground."
— Louisiana Sen. Robert Barham (R)

#### What Happens During Communication Breakdown
**Telecommunication Loss:**
- **Natural Disasters:**
  - Wipes out telecommunication infrastructures
  - Requires days to months to re-establish
- **Government Suppression:**
  - Infrastructure remains intact
  - Can be restored by "flipping the switch"
  - Historically, down for only a few days

**Case Studies:**

**Japanese Earthquake & Tsunami:**
- **Impacted:**
  - Cellular / Landline phones
  - Power
  - Transportation
  - Undersea communication
- **Response:**
  - Use of loudspeakers
  - Television news broadcasts
  - Mobile cellular base stations
  - Increased WiFi hotspots

**Hurricane Katrina:**
- **Impacted:**
  - Cellular / Landline phones
  - Local television stations
  - Power
  - Transportation
- **Response:**
  - Relocation of news services
  - Mobile cellular base stations
  - Amateur radio operators

**Human Impact of Katrina:**
- Communication breakdown caused deaths.
- "Critical information could not be transmitted. The levees broke, and no one other than local residents knew about the massive flooding for several hours. Victims could not communicate with possible responders, increasing the lack of response and devastation. Lack of communications at all levels increased the chaos, deaths, and destruction in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina."
— Lieutenant Colonel Heather K. Meeds, United States Army National Guard

**Egyptian Revolution:**
- **Impacted:**
  - Social networks
  - Mobile phones
  - Television network coverage
  - Internet (January 27-31)
  - SMS
  - Landlines
- **Response:**
  - Used smartphones as modems
  - Landlines with dial-up modems
  - Fax machines
  - Amateur radio
- **Proposed Alternative:**
  - Wireless mesh network using laptops

#### Ad Hoc Technology
**Mesh Network:**
- **Data Dissemination:**
  - Each node acts as a relay
  - Captures and disseminates data
- **Types:**
  - Flooding Relay
  - Routing Relay
- **Examples:**
  - Mobile ad hoc network (MANET)
  - Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET)

**Purpose During a Revolution / Natural Disaster:**
- **Information Dissemination:**
  - Revolution activities
  - Evacuation notices
  - Weather alerts
  - Decrease misinformation and fear
- **Emergency Services:**
  - Fire / Police / Ambulance
  - Hospital locations and closures
- **Communication with Relatives:**
  - Rally points
  - Reassurance

#### Potential Ad Hoc Nodes

**Laptops:**
- **Advantages:**
  - TCP/IP stack already integrated
  - Meets/exceeds capabilities of routers
  - Flexible (apps, data storage, accessories)
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Expensive
  - Not very portable
  - Power hungry
  - Requires pre-existing software

**Amateur Radios:**
- **Advantages:**
  - Available in various sizes
  - Can relay TCP/IP
  - Portable
  - Long signal reach
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Specialized knowledge required
  - Not ubiquitous

**Corporate / Government Options:**
- **Advantages:**
  - Authoritative information
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Slow to respond
  - Requires infrastructure (base stations, television)
  - Consumes resources (helicopters, mobile police force)

**Cellular Smartphones:**
- **Advantages:**
  - Ubiquitous/accepted technology
  - Low power consumption
  - Very portable
  - Flexible (apps, data storage, accessories)
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Limited range
  - Requires pre-existing software

#### Disaster Response
- **Need for a Combination:**
  - Cellular phone services are vulnerable to disruption
  - Power outages impact most responses
  - Portability is critical due to shifting circumstances
  - Security (both secure and non-secure)
  - Interoperability

**Proposal for Future Ad Hoc Communication Methods:**
- **Today’s Focus: Smartphones**
  - **Communication Protocols:**
    - Wireless: IEEE 802.11a/b/g, Bluetooth
    - Messaging and Data: POP3, IMAP4, SMS
    - Location: GPS antenna
  - **Potential Ad Hoc Networks:**
    - **Mobile ad hoc network (MANET):**
      - Works with current Internet technology
      - Longer ranges
      - Requires phones capable of relaying data
      - High power consumption
    - **Bluetooth ad hoc network:**
      - Low power requirements
      - Short ranges

**MANET vs. Bluetooth:**
- **MANET:**
  - Goal: Internet connectivity
  - Useful when power is not an issue
- **Bluetooth:**
  - Preferred when power is an issue
  - Data stays local, easier to disseminate information to a specific region

**What Data?**
- **During a Revolution / Natural Disaster:**
  - **Emergency Alert Information Dissemination:**
    - Revolution activities
    - Evacuation notices
    - Weather alerts
    - Hospital locations and closures
  - **Emergency Services Command, Control & Communication (C3):**
    - Fire / Police / Ambulance
  - **Requires:**
    - Message validation and encryption

**Auto-BAHN Open Source Project:**
- **Automated Broadcast Ad Hoc Network:**
  - Goals:
    - Use existing smartphone technology to create ad hoc networks
    - Find the shortest path possible to/from emergency services
    - Allow the population to create/join ad hoc communication channels as needed
    - Provide confidentiality and integrity to some messages
    - Easy user interface
    - Integrated into current phone kernels

**Technical Details:**
- To be announced.

**Conclusion:**
- The need for robust, decentralized communication methods during crises is evident. By leveraging existing technologies and developing innovative solutions like Auto-BAHN, we can enhance our ability to stay connected and respond effectively to both natural disasters and political upheavals.
