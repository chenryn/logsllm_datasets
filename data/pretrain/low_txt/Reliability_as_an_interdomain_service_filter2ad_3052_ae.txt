### Observations and Analysis of REIN's Performance

**Traffic Intensity Reduction:**
On August 31, 2004, we observed that the REIN (Reliability as an Interdomain Network) framework reduced traffic intensity from 350% to 80% of the bottleneck link capacity. The interdomain bypass paths contributed to a 270% reduction in traffic intensity on the bottleneck link. These results highlight the effectiveness of REIN and the robust path-based algorithm during specific intervals over two days.

**Overall Performance:**
To summarize the overall performance over a one-week period, we evaluated REIN and the robust path-based Traffic Engineering/Fast Rerouting (TE/FRR) algorithm. Figure 7(a) illustrates the reduction in traffic intensity by REIN for single-link failure scenarios, showing a relatively small reduction. This is expected because the TE/FRR algorithm effectively distributes traffic, and the network remains stable under single-link failures, as depicted in Figure 5. REIN demonstrates its effectiveness in more severe network failure scenarios. Figure 7(b) shows the impact of REIN under two-link failure scenarios, where it reduces traffic intensity on the bottleneck link by 20% to 60% of the link capacity for 90% of the intervals. For the remaining 10% of intervals, the reduction is even more significant, ranging from 220% to 270% of the link capacity, particularly starting from interval 208 in Figure 6(a).

**US-ISP Evaluation:**
For the US-ISP network, our evaluation focused on worst-case analysis due to the lack of accurate failure logs. We used both traffic demand and failure logs to assess the performance of REIN and the robust path-based TE/FRR algorithm. Our interdomain bypass selection algorithm identified 12 bypass paths from three neighboring networks of US-ISP. To maintain confidentiality, we reported normalized relative traffic intensity on the bottleneck link, rather than absolute values. Figure 8 illustrates the reduction in normalized traffic intensity by REIN, comparing our robust path-based TE/FRR algorithm with the oblivious routing/bypass algorithm proposed by Applegate et al. [5]. The distribution of traffic reduction by REIN for US-ISP was more uniform compared to Abilene, with a maximum reduction of 118% and 35% for oblivious and robust routing, respectively. This difference can be attributed to the over-provisioned and highly redundant nature of the US-ISP network, as well as the potential incompleteness of the failure logs. Despite these factors, REIN still significantly reduced traffic on the bottleneck link in certain failure scenarios.

**Impact on Peering Links:**
A potential concern with REIN is its impact on peering links and neighboring networks when diverting traffic during failure events. In our evaluations, the traffic diverted through interdomain bypass paths never exceeded 60% of the exported capacity for Abilene and 70% for US-ISP. This indicates that the benefits of REIN are achieved at a moderate cost to neighboring networks.

### Tradeoffs in REIN

The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and the robust path-based TE/FRR algorithm. A key implementation technique is the coverage-based path generation algorithm, which allows for explicit tradeoffs between optimality and scalability. Figures 9 and 10 illustrate these tradeoffs. Higher coverage leads to a greater number of paths required per Origin-Destination (OD) pair, resulting in better performance. Using 3 Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in Abilene and 5 LSPs in US-ISP achieves near-optimal performance. The flat part of the performance-ratio curve at low coverage is due to the fact that all those coverage ratios can be achieved using only one path for each OD pair. Additionally, our bound provided by Proposition 1 is tight after 70% coverage, offering a good prediction of performance.

### Related Work

The importance of reliability in communication networks has long been recognized, with numerous efforts aimed at improving network reliability at low cost. Historically, most networks relied on link layer techniques such as SONET rings for protection. However, the high cost and inflexibility of SONET led many networks to adopt IP-layer solutions for handling failures. Various adaptive routing techniques have been developed to optimize routing under potential failures, referred to as restoration techniques. While these techniques are effective, they may not meet the response time requirements of mission-critical applications. Therefore, MPLS-based protection techniques, which precompute rerouting paths and quickly reroute traffic upon failure detection, have become a standard feature in modern routers.

REIN complements both restoration and protection techniques by utilizing them over an augmented intradomain topology with virtual links corresponding to additional interdomain bypass paths. This increases redundancy and improves performance. Protection techniques require the computation of rerouting paths, and several algorithms have been proposed, including the optimal oblivious fast rerouting algorithms by Applegate et al. [5]. However, these algorithms use flow-based routing, which is not easily implementable in the current Internet. Our coverage-based path generation technique achieves implementable optimal fast rerouting.

REIN is also complementary to approaches that focus on protecting interdomain links, such as multihoming, which protects links at the border and outside the IP network. Overlay networks, while flexible and capable of faster failure detection, rely on transport layer timeouts and have limited visibility and control compared to REIN.

### Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper, we proposed the REIN framework to improve the redundancy of IP networks at low cost. We developed robust algorithms to efficiently utilize network resources under failures. Future work will focus on further refining the tradeoffs between optimality and scalability, as well as exploring additional applications of the REIN framework.
