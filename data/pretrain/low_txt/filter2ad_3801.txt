## Abstract

In this talk, I will discuss "advanced cryptography," which encompasses cryptographic techniques beyond traditional communication security. These include zero-knowledge proofs, secure multi-party computation, homomorphic encryption, and related methods.

I will argue that advanced cryptography is (a) essential, (b) sufficiently efficient to be practical, and (c) not yet generally usable in a broad range of applications.

**Keywords:** Privacy, Homomorphic Encryption, Secure Multi-Party Computation, Zero-Knowledge Proofs

## Biography

Dr. Shai Halevi is a Principal Research Staff Member at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, where he focuses on advanced cryptographic techniques such as homomorphic encryption, cryptographic code obfuscation, and secure computation. He is a fellow and board member of the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) and the recipient of the 2017 ACM-SIGSAC Outstanding Innovation Award, as well as several best-paper awards. Dr. Halevi is also the author of the HElib library for homomorphic encryption.
