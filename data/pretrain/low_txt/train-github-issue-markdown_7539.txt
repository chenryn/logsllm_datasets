### Summary of the New Feature/Enhancement

The current limitation restricts the length of environment variables to 8,196 characters. This enhancement proposes making this limitation optional, allowing users to enable or disable it via a registry key.

### Proposed Technical Implementation Details (Optional)

To implement this feature, we can introduce a new registry key that controls the enforcement of the character limit for environment variables. The key can be a simple boolean value (e.g., `EnableCharacterLimit`), where:
- `0` (or `False`) disables the character limit.
- `1` (or `True`) enforces the character limit.

This approach provides flexibility for users who need to work with longer environment variables while maintaining the existing behavior for those who do not require this change.

Thank you.
