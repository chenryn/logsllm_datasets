**Editorial**

Dear Friends,

It has been one year since AIS SIGSEMIS became a key reference point for the Semantic Web and Information Systems communities. Your continuous support has been instrumental in our efforts to disseminate information and knowledge about the Semantic Web and Information Systems through various channels:

1. **Bulletin Edition**: This is our fourth issue, with an average of 5,500 downloads per issue.
2. **International Journal on Semantic Web and Information Systems (IJSWIS)**: Launched with Prof. Amit Sheth as the Editor-in-Chief, published by IDEA Group Publishing. Two issues have already been released, and the third is in production. We encourage you to recommend it to your library.
3. **Special Issues in Leading Journals**: We have organized special issues in well-known international journals to raise awareness about the Semantic Web. This includes:
   - Library Management Journal: "Digital Libraries in the Knowledge Era: Knowledge Management and Semantic Web Technology"
   - IJSWIS: "Semantic Web and Healthcare Information Systems Interoperability"
   - British Journal of Educational Technology: "Advances of Semantic Web for E-learning: Expanding Learning Frontiers"
   - IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering: "Knowledge and Data Engineering in the Semantic Web Era"
   - Electronic Government: "Exploiting Knowledge Management for Ubiquitous E-Government in the Semantic Web Era"

4. **Conference Tracks and Workshops**: We support and sponsor tracks and workshops in major IS conferences, including:
   - ECIS Track on Semantic Web and Information Systems
   - AMCIS Track on Semantic E-Business
   - FOMI 2004: Formal Ontologies Meet Industry

5. **MSR'05 Conference**: Co-organizing the First Online Conference on Metadata and Semantics Research, which is a key event for planned SW publications.

Our membership has grown to 75 registered members, and we extend our gratitude to all of you. In response to the recent Tsunami disaster in Southeast Asia, we donated $270 from our limited reserves to the American Red Cross International Disaster Fund. We thank the AIS SIGSEMIS Board members for supporting this decision.

In this issue, we are honored to feature interviews with Professor William R. King, the Founding President of AIS, and Professor Richard Watson, the current President of AIS. These interviews provide valuable insights and perspectives.

We also include several interesting pieces of news:
- An article by Amit Sheth, Director of LSDIS at the University of Georgia, on "Why We Are Still Pushing the Semantic Web?"
- An update on IJSWIS
- News on AIS SIGSEMIS activities, including calls for papers and sponsored minitracks
- Two research articles
- Our regular columns, including a new column by Heiner Stuckenschmidt on "RDF Technologies – Foundations, Applications, and Developments"
- A special section on the EU call for Semantic Web Knowledge Systems

We invite you to join our SIG and be part of an exciting community. For more information, visit [http://www.sigsemis.org/sig/membership/document_view](http://www.sigsemis.org/sig/membership/document_view). When renewing your AIS subscription, consider SIGSEMIS as an option.

**Why We Are Still Pushing the Semantic Web?**

By Amit Sheth
Director, LSDIS Lab at the University of Georgia; CTO/Co-founder, Semagix, Inc.

At the W3C Advisory Committee meeting in December 2004, a panelist asked why we are still pushing the Semantic Web. The question implied that the industry should have recognized its importance and seen wider adoption by now. My response was that the progress is robust and pervasive, with clear signs that the Semantic Web is not just a fad but will have a significant impact on businesses and common Web users within the next five years.

**Research**: Funding from agencies like NSF and DARPA has waned, but the DAML program provided a timely boost to Semantic Web research in the US. Europe has taken the lead with Framework V and VI. The number of new conferences, published papers, and scientific journals dedicated to the Semantic Web indicates a broad and growing interest.

**Standards**: Timely standards activity has benefited the area, reducing the chances of conflicts between competing interests. The absence of competing standards bodies, as seen in the Web Services area, is also helpful.

**Technology and Products**: Several technologies have been commercialized from academic research, such as Taalee’s MediaAnywhere and Semagix’s Freedom. At least twenty vendors now claim to use or support Semantic Web technologies, and the list is growing. Large and targeted ontologies are being built at an impressive pace.

**Industry Recognition**: Thought leaders and industry executives, such as Tim O'Reilly and Bill Ruh, have expressed their support for the Semantic Web. At industry events, high levels of interest are evident, with 100 to 300+ attendees.

**Industry Deployment and Early Successes**: There are increasing examples of Semantic Web deployments in enterprises and for common Web users. Some applications are stealthily incorporating Semantic Web technologies, such as Creative Commons’ use of RDF. These applications can quickly lead to widespread and pervasive use of RDF. Semantic Web technologies are also being integrated into mainstream IT solutions, such as anti-money laundering and compliance management.

While some in the community, like Tim Berners-Lee, argue that the Semantic Web is not interesting on a smaller scale, I believe it is equally important at the intra- and inter-enterprise levels. Enterprises can leverage deeper domain semantics, reach faster agreements on ontology development, and utilize industry-specific metadata standards. Today’s enterprises have millions of documents and access to high-quality data, making targeted enterprise-scale Semantic Applications highly relevant.
