### 6.1.2 Phone Reputation

While carrier reputation can help control the creation rate of phone-verified accounts (PVAs), phone reputation can directly block abusive registrations. The primary challenge in implementing a phone reputation system is the rapid pace of abuse. As discussed in Section 4.2, 62% of phones used for verifying abusive accounts have a lifespan of less than one hour. Therefore, if abuse reports cannot flag a phone number in a timely manner, the window for the reputation system to prevent abuse will have passed. One possible solution is for services to limit the rate of new registrations tied to the same phone number (e.g., by enforcing a waiting period before a phone number can be reused). However, this approach offers no protection if numbers are single-use.

To enhance the effectiveness of phone reputation systems, services could share abuse information, preventing verification-as-a-service merchants (discussed in Section 4.1) from registering multiple accounts across different services with a single phone number. Additionally, phone reputation could evolve into a predictive score that assesses the risk associated with previously unseen phone numbers linked to newly registered accounts. Potential features for such a system include the sequentiality of phone numbers and whether the number has appeared in other contexts before. We leave the development of such a system for future work.

### 6.1.3 Phone Re-verification

The relatively short lifespan of phone numbers—less than one hour in our analysis—presents an opportunity for defenders to re-verify phone numbers as an effective abuse mitigation strategy. By limiting re-verification as a response to suspicious activity (e.g., sending an abnormal number of emails or rapidly subscribing to hundreds of YouTube channels), legitimate users can avoid the friction imposed by phone verification. Conversely, miscreants who purchase accounts will not have access to the original phone number tied to an account after it changes hands. Similarly, spammers who register their own credentials must retain access to thousands of SIM cards, which may not be feasible if they rely on verification-as-a-service merchants. This adds another layer of complexity to circumventing phone verification, where the duration of access becomes as important as the quantity of phone numbers available to miscreants. We note that Facebook may already use this practice based on chatter from underground forums, but we cannot confirm this.

### 6.2 Open Challenges

#### 6.2.1 Phone Chaining

When miscreants abuse free call forwarding services like Google Voice, they must register a phone number to serve as the forwarding endpoint. While this initial number is intended as a safeguard, similar to email verification or a CAPTCHA, the existence of other free (virtual) numbers undermines this protection. This is exacerbated by the potential many-to-one relationship between seed numbers and numbers handed out by forwarding telephony services, leading to a vulnerability we call "phone chaining." Miscreants can use a single free mobile or VoIP number that fans out to multiple free forwarding numbers, which in turn can serve as forwarding endpoints at other services. Even if virtual number providers prevent chaining within their own pool, miscreants can obfuscate the original identity of a number by cycling through multiple forwarding services. Absent a comprehensive forwarding blacklist, which is difficult to acquire due to the constant changes in phone ranges and limited transparency in phone ownership, there is little to prevent this practice. An alternative is to charge for forwarding numbers, but global adoption would be required to prevent miscreants from shifting to free providers.

#### 6.2.2 Resource Exhaustion Attacks

Phone verification is not cost-free; services must pay a fee for each attempted SMS or phone challenge. This exposes them to resource exhaustion attacks. Miscreants can request thousands of spurious verification codes for non-existent numbers or phones tied to legitimate victims, who may also incur delivery fees. Assuming a fixed daily budget, a fail-open system allows miscreants to bypass phone verification entirely, while a fail-closed system blocks legitimate users from registering new accounts. This challenge also exists for email verification, where excessive bounce notifications can degrade the delivery rate of important messages. While services can perform risk analysis and block suspicious registrations before sending an SMS challenge, resource exhaustion attacks remain an open challenge.

#### 6.2.3 Compromised Phones

The widespread adoption of Android and iOS devices introduces the risk of mobile malware [8]. Instances exist where the Zeus banking trojan has intercepted two-factor authentication PINs to liquidate a victim's assets [27]. Other threats include mobile drive-by-downloads installing the NotCompatible malware family, which converts a victim’s phone into a mobile proxy [19]. Although we found no evidence of miscreants using compromised phones as verification endpoints, there is no reason to believe that compromised phones will not become a commodity market like compromised hosts [5]. This possibility undermines the long-term sustainability of phone verification and any protection provided by carrier-level reputation. It also forces phone reputation systems into a reactive position, effectively becoming phone blacklists similar to existing IP and DNS blacklists [21].

### 7. Related Work

#### Monetizing Account Access

Miscreants leverage bulk-registered accounts to expose legitimate users to spam, phishing, and malware [9, 11]. At its core, a substantial amount of spam serves to advertise products and lure people into purchasing pharmaceuticals, replica goods, and counterfeit software, often with the aid of complex infrastructure managed by affiliates and affiliate programs [14]. Recent alternatives in monetization include ad syndication services and ad-based URL shortening [25]. These examples highlight the range of strategies miscreants employ to generate profit once they gain access to account credentials.

#### Reputation Systems

Reputation is commonly used to prevent or limit abuse of web services. One technique, rooted in email spam filtering, involves using IP addresses for reputation [13]. IP reputation enables a web service to quickly score actions and label them as abusive or benign. However, IP reputation can be error-prone, and new techniques have been developed to evaluate IP address ranges with a mix of benign and abusive actions [13]. Approaches to reputation have also evaluated automated scoring using network-level features [12]. In addition to IP addresses, other forms of reputation are used to label domains [4] and accounts on web services by leveraging the observed actions of existing users to vet new accounts [28]. Phone reputation over voice has also been explored based on audio features introduced by telephony networks [2], though such features do not extend to numbers used purely for SMS.

#### Applications of Phone Verification

In addition to preventing fraudulent account registration, SMS and phone verification are widely used to prevent account hijacking. A common use is two-factor authentication for online banking, where a one-time code is sent via SMS and used along with the username and password to log in [20]. Despite its benefits, two-factor authentication is not without vulnerabilities, and criminals have used malware to intercept SMS messages on target phones [10, 20]. Similar to two-factor authentication, other uses for phone verification include account recovery and as an informational channel to alert users of changes to their account.

### 8. Conclusion

In this paper, we presented a longitudinal study of the underlying technical and financial factors influencing the diminishing effectiveness of phone verification. To conduct our study, we combined underground intelligence gleaned from 4,695 phone-verified accounts purchased from 14 blackmarket merchants and 300,000 phone-verified accounts disabled by Google for spam and abuse. We found that merchants were capable of registering a steady stream of thousands of PVAs, which subsequently sold for $85–$500 per 1K to the underground. Many of these merchants operated in a manner similar to spam affiliate programs, highlighting the specialization within the underground ecosystem. We also found that merchants used inexpensive VoIP numbers to circumvent the intended cost of acquiring SIM cards, effectively invalidating the defense provided by phone verification. As this practice became widespread, we observed a simultaneous market-wide price drop of 30–40% for Google PVAs until Google penalized verifications from frequently abused phone carriers. Our results highlight how blackmarket monitoring can provide invaluable insights into the performance of abuse safeguards, simplifying the task of defenders in keeping pace with the evolutions of the underground and better protecting users against spam and abuse.
