### Goal and Methodology

The primary objective is to reliably detect target videos with high self-similarity. The remaining 15 movies were divided into random sets of 10 training movies and 5 target movies. For each training/target combination, we evaluated the matching performance using our thresholding method (Section 9.3), which rejects queries unless there is a 0.05 gap in the cross-correlation between the best candidate match and the runner-up.

For each combination of training and target movie sets, we computed the matching using a database of neural network-generated EMI (for the 5 target movies) and queried using real TV EMI (from 10 test movies, including the 5 target movies with generated EMI via the neural network and the 5 movies originally excluded due to low self-similarity). The average cross-correlation of the neural network output and the ground truth EMI for the Panasonic-42-A for the 5 target movies was 0.88 (for a query length of 60 minutes).

Figure 9 illustrates the results of submitting real EMI for the 5 target movies into our query matching system (the hit rate at 60 minutes is 0.74, lower than 0.88, due to the 0.05 threshold gap). Figure 10 visually shows the alignment between the generated EMI for a target movie and the real EMI for that movie. The matching database correctly rejected EMI from the five movies originally excluded because of low self-similarity with an average probability of 96.8% (averaged across query lengths longer than 15 minutes).

Using brightness as an isolated input to train a network generates signals that are 0.73 correlated with real EMI for the target movies (other features produce an average of 0.17 correlation). Future work should explore hypothesis-driven regression models to better understand generative EMI sources, although such analysis will require careful experimentation with secondary sources of EMI signal modulation (e.g., display processing circuitry), as suggested by our results and confirmed by [18].

### Plausibility and Experimental Focus

It is important to note that the above analysis should be viewed as evidence of plausibility. The primary focus of our work is on the experimental analysis of real EMI, as discussed in previous sections. Our results suggest that it is feasible to use supervised methods to train generative models of EMI.

Although we cannot claim that this network structure is globally optimal for our problem, it offered high performance and low overfitting after experimenting with a large set of multi-layered neuron arrangements.

### Regulatory and Practical Considerations

Electromagnetic interference (EMI) must conform to FCC regulations. Additionally, blocking EMI could interfere with legitimate powerline-based communication systems like broadband over powerline and X10(r) home automated systems. A more practical approach might be to identify potential devices leaking information by observing the power line and only blocking certain frequency bands using an active noise rejection system or informing the homeowner where to install line isolators.

An out-of-band solution, such as new regulation on how SMPS power supplies are built, faces political challenges and a fundamental tension: it may be impossible to fully defend against information disclosure while still complying with Energy STAR. This creates a challenge to develop systems that are both highly energy-efficient and private.

### Key Features and Conclusions

Through this contribution, we assess the key features of SMPS information leakage over the powerline and provide a knowledge base to aid in future efforts for mitigating the tension between device functionality and privacy.

### Conclusions

We conducted an extensive study of powerline information leakage from eight modern TVs spanning two technologies (LCD, Plasma), three sizes (32, 42, 58 inches), and three manufacturers (Panasonic, Samsung, Sharp). We found that these TVs generally produce stable, robust EMI signals on the powerline that correlate with the video being displayed. We discuss two adversarial goals that do not require an adversary to pre-train on all possible movies but rather train on a small set of video content. We also describe two classes of adversaries: intentional (malicious hardware attached to the home's powerline) and unintentional (ubiquitous computing devices collecting privacy-compromising measurements).

We experimentally evaluated our approach with 20 movies in both a clean laboratory setting and electrically noisy home environments. We then describe extensions to our core work that allow an attacker to infer information from a home's TV's EMI without ever requiring access to that TV or another TV of the same model. Lastly, we discuss some defenses and fundamental challenges to fully defending against this threat.

### Discussion

#### Applicability to Other Devices

To better understand the scope of information leakage exposed via conducted EMI from SMPS, we surveyed other common home electronics: a personal computer, a laptop, a laser printer, a DVD player, a game console, and a washing machine. Our aim was to assess whether these SMPS-based appliances similarly produce noise signatures as a function of their device operation. We observed that many appliances yield EMI signal fluctuations that are correlated with the various functions they support.

#### Defenses and Challenges

There are several potential countermeasures for minimizing information leakage through EMI. One simple defense mechanism is to connect SMPS-based devices to a powerline isolator. Another potential whole-home solution would be to inject random high-energy broadband noise over the powerline, though this approach faces practical challenges.
