### Exploits and Their Economic Value

Exploits vary widely by software vendor, and their value is negatively correlated with their age. Specifically, Adobe and Microsoft exploits retain their value significantly longer than Oracle exploits. This suggests a sustained economic interest in exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft and Adobe products, a finding consistent with related research on the persistence of vulnerabilities on end-user systems [55]. The price of exploits can also vary significantly based on the exploit vendor. Pseudo-R² values indicate that the models used are adequate in explaining the observed effects. For instance, Model 3 explains approximately 40% of the variance in exploit price estimates. Importantly, all variables in the model can be easily assessed with just the knowledge of the vulnerability at any point in time.

### Exploitation in the Wild

In this section, we evaluate the impact of identified market variables on the exploitation of traded vulnerabilities in the wild. A key consideration is that certain exploits may evade detection for some time, for example, through frequent repacking. However, it is unlikely for an exploit to remain completely undetected for a long time while delivering hundreds of thousands or millions of attacks [7, 56]. To reduce uncertainty around exploit detection, we restrict our analysis to exploits published in RuMarket at least a year before the SYM data collection (i.e., before April 1, 2016). This coincides with the median lifetime of an exploit package in RuMarket (see Fig. 5) and allows SYM a full calendar year to report an exploit at scale. This leaves us with n = 78 exploits.

#### Package Price and Market Activity vs. Exploitation

When considering the effect of acquiring and deploying an exploit, we focus on the cost of the package rather than the individual exploit, as this reflects the upfront price the attacker must pay to deploy the attack. Figure 11 shows the distribution of package prices (left) and replies on the market (right) against exploitation in the wild. Overall, we find that exploits in SYM are traded at a lower upfront price than those not included in SYM. Similarly, market interest, as estimated by PackActivity, has a significant impact on exploitation: exploits that receive more attention from the RuMarket community have a higher chance of being exploited in the wild compared to those with less market activity. A breakdown by package types does not reveal any significant interactions between the variables. These results support recent findings highlighting the importance of the economics of the attack process in analyzing cyber-attack scenarios [14, 20, 56, 72] and in developing sensible cybercrime-based measures for risk assessment [13, 39].

#### Vulnerability Severity

Previous studies have shown a lack of correlation between technical vulnerability characteristics and exploitation [20]. Experts and best practices often advise considering additional factors, such as the presence of an exploit in black markets [9], to obtain more significant tests for actual exploitation [38]. Following [9], we categorize vulnerabilities into two categories based on their CVSS severity score: critical (C) (CVSS ≥ 9) and non-critical (NC) (CVSS < 9). Table 8 reports the corresponding distributions against SYM. Consistent with previous research on Exploit Kits alone [9], we find that critical vulnerabilities traded in the cybercrime markets have a higher chance of being exploited in the wild (93% in our sample) compared to non-critical vulnerabilities (62%, p = 0.0021).

### Regression Analysis of Exploitation in the Wild

To rigorously evaluate the correlation between the identified market and vulnerability variables and exploitation in the wild, we select three logit regression models of the following form over the binary response variable SYM:

**Model 1:**
\[ \text{SYM}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \log(\text{PackActivity}_i) + \epsilon_i \]

**Model 2:**
\[ \text{SYM}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \log(\text{PackActivity}_i) + \beta_2 \log(\text{PackPrice}_i) + \epsilon_i \]

**Model 3:**
\[ \text{SYM}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \log(\text{PackActivity}_i) + \beta_2 \log(\text{PackPrice}_i) + \beta_3 \text{CVSS:NC}_i + \epsilon_i \]

where SYM indicates the presence or absence of exploit at scale; PackActivity is the number of replies received by the product advert; PackPrice is the upfront price to pay to obtain the exploit; and CVSS:NC is the CVSS categorization of the vulnerability severity as non-critical.

Regression results are reported in Table 9. Coefficients should be interpreted as the change in the odds ratio of exploit in the wild. For example, Model 3 indicates that for every increase in one unit of \(\log(\text{PackActivity})\), there is a three-fold increase in the odds of exploitation in the wild (\(e^{1.101} = 3.01\)). The coefficient significance indicates that exploits bundled in packages with more market activity are more likely to be detected in the wild than those with less activity. Interestingly, we find that package prices also have a significant and negative impact on the odds of exploitation. This indicates that, all else being equal, exploits bundled in more expensive packages are less likely to be detected in the wild than comparable exploits in less expensive packages. These findings support the existence of a relationship between market activity and exploit deployment in the wild [9, 15, 56]. Vulnerability severity also has a negative impact on the likelihood of exploit, indicating that the risk of exploitation for vulnerabilities in RuMarket increases for critical vulnerabilities. All models show satisfactory Pseudo-R² values, with Model 3 explaining most of the variance.

### Discussion

#### Exploit Measures

An important aspect of threat assessment is the consideration of exploit metrics. Current approaches often implement these by looking at the technical requirements of an attack, including the evasion of attack mitigation measures [74] and the complexity of the attack [20]. While a technical assessment can shed light on the relative ordering of attack preferences, it is challenging to quantify absolute likelihoods. For example, a utility-maximizing attacker may decide not to perform (or delay) an attack if they do not believe there is a positive payoff, given the cost of exploit acquisition. Our analysis provides the first pointers in this direction by quantifying the relationship between time, software, and exploit pricing. Importantly, this estimate only requires readily available information on the vulnerability, and the elastic relationship between the age of the exploit and its price can be used to evaluate relative changes in exploit price as time passes. This directly affects current estimates of attack costs used in risk assessment practices [20, 38, 74]. Similarly, the update of attackers' exploit portfolios is an important step driving the variance in the risk of attacks [10, 18]. We find that new exploits are introduced at rates between two and six months, and this rate is approximately equal for all software. The process driving this update remains to be uncovered, and follow-up studies may look at the factors driving the appearance of exploits in the markets (e.g., by considering pre-existing exploits or software updates [10, 55]).

The dynamics of underground markets have often been pointed to as an important factor in the overall risk of attacks, but a clear link between the two is currently missing. While the problem of attack attribution remains open (i.e., we cannot establish a causality link), this paper provides important indications of the correlation between market operations and the realization of attacks. This underscores the importance of economic aspects of vulnerability exploitation in well-informed security practices (e.g., vulnerability assessment and prioritization [38, 73]). For example, our analysis of market activity and the odds of exploitation in the wild reveals a significant and positive relationship between the two. Similarly, exploits that are more expensive to acquire have lower odds of exploitation than cheaper ones. This information is often ignored in risk-assessment studies [38], and condensed metrics for vulnerability assessment are used instead [54, 73]. While existing vulnerability metrics are known not to correlate with attacks in the wild [9, 20], we find that they do once the effect of market inclusion is considered. Importantly, this provides a useful tool for a first evaluation of the risk of exploit without insights from the cybercrime markets other than whether the vulnerability is present [9]. A more precise estimation can then be obtained by measuring market activity around the packages embedding the exploit. These results can be factored into current best practices for vulnerability risk management and exploit mitigation [31, 51, 74].

#### Vulnerability Economics

Previous studies in the literature have highlighted the operations of criminal markets for drugs, arms, and pornography [69], and for the monetization of stolen information resulting from an attack [36]. However, little insight exists on the markets that trade the technology enabling the attack in the first place. A few estimates exist [1], but they are mostly based on zero-day price allegations, vary widely, and their relevance for the overall risk of attack remains unclear [18, 63]. The scientific community has long discussed the idea of building "legitimate vulnerability markets" [14, 46, 57], and the result is the institution of a few legitimate exploit markets [63] and several "bug bounty" initiatives that reward security researchers for disclosing new vulnerabilities [30] and discourage participation in the underground economy. In this context, it is interesting to observe that the prices of modern bug-bounty programs are in line with or below those we identify on RuMarket. For example, [30, Tab. 4 pp281] reports that the majority of vulnerability prizes awarded by Google in their Chrome Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP) are at or below $1,000, and most external contributors to the program (i.e., vulnerability researchers) earn between $500 and $1,000. The median price of an exploit in RuMarket, shown in Table 6, is approximately $2,000, a higher but not distant figure from those indicated in [30]. It is, however, unclear whether the resulting balance weighs in favor of the legitimate or underground vulnerability markets. The dynamics balancing vulnerability finding (a notoriously demanding process [52]) and exploitation trade have not been fully investigated in the literature yet. For example, at the above rates, it does not seem unlikely that vendors who sell their exploits multiple times to different buyers may still be better off participating in the cybercrime economy than moving to the "legitimate" vulnerability markets, as in the latter, vulnerabilities can realistically be traded only once (as the trade creates an association between the "zero-day" vulnerability and the identity of the discoverer). The results in this paper represent a first building block in the evaluation and enhancement of current legitimate vulnerability markets, fostering the responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities and attracting skilled researchers away from criminal markets.

Our exploit price estimates provide additional insights into the effect of different criminal business models on exploit pricing and, therefore, the accessibility of attacks. With reference to Table 14 in the Appendix, and despite the upwards bias of the estimate (Eq. 2), EKIT exploits are priced, per unit, significantly below exploits in other package types. This effect is driven by the higher number of exploits bundled in EKIT (refer to Table 3) and underlines how the different business model employed by EKIT services may allow exploit vendors to drastically reduce exploit development and deployment costs. Lower prices may make these tools more accessible to "wanna-be-criminals," potentially generating more attacks overall. This suggests that the criminal business model may play a central role in the diffusion of cyber-attacks and calls for additional studies characterizing this effect. Further, we find that the studied market shows clear signs of expansion, with a growing number of vendors, exploits, attack products, and generally inflating package prices. This indicates that market activity is unlikely to stop in the near future, and that attacker economics will likely play an increasingly relevant role in the cybersecurity scenario.

### Conclusions

In this paper, we presented the first quantitative account of exploit pricing and market effects on exploitation in the wild. Our findings quantify a strong correlation between market activities and the likelihood of exploit. We find that the analyzed market shows signs of expansion, and that exploit-as-a-service models may allow for drastic cuts in exploit development costs. Further, we find that exploit prices are aligned with or above those of "legitimate" vulnerability markets, supporting work on the identification of incentives for responsible vulnerability disclosure and attack economics.
