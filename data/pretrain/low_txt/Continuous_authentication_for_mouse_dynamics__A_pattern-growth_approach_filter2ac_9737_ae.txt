### Useful Performance Levels for Large-Scale Deployment

For a large-scale deployment, the system should be capable of handling 3000 mouse operations. Improvements in accuracy are crucial for real systems, which can be achieved through appropriate settings.

**Behavior Patterns and Classification Methods**

The One-Class SVM, neural network, and nearest neighbor classifiers were used to analyze features from mouse behavior patterns. The high accuracy in our results may be attributed to the stability and robustness of the data. It is important to note that these results are significantly better than those obtained from other behavior mining methods. We hypothesize that the fine-grained characterization of mouse behavior contributes to this effectiveness. Our method's performance is very close to the European standard, which requires an accuracy with a false acceptance rate (FAR) of 0.001% and a false rejection rate (FRR) of 1%.

### Second Observation: One-Class SVM Performance

The One-Class SVM outperformed all other detectors in this study. This superior performance may be due to the ability of SVMs to convert the problem into a quadratic optimization task while maintaining high accuracy and stability. Additionally, the One-Class SVM showed competitive standard deviations of FAR and FRR, indicating its robustness to variable behavior data.

|--------------|---------|-----------------|---------------|-----|-----|--------------------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| Ours         | 2.75%   | 3.39%           | 10 minutes    | Uncontrolled | 28 | Owner and Impostor | Continuous authentication |
| Pusara et al. [1] | 0.43% | 1.75% | 1 to 14.5 minutes | Uncontrolled | 11 | Owner and Impostor | Continuous authentication |

| Schulz [8] | 24.3% | 24.3% | Not reported | Uncontrolled | 60 | Owner and Impostor | Continuous authentication |
| Zheng et al. [25] | 1.3% | 1.3% | 37.37 minutes | Uncontrolled | 30 | Owner and Impostor | Continuous authentication |

*Assumption based on data collection: 12 hours 55 minutes per subject, representing 1033 seconds.

### Comparison with Previous Work

In this section, we compare our results with previous studies in terms of continuous authentication. Pusara et al. [1] and Ahmed et al. [6, 12] achieved acceptable accuracy but with relatively small sample sizes. Schulz [8] reported a high equal error rate of 24.3%, which may compromise security. Our approach, with FAR of 2.75% and FRR of 3.39%, shows promise but still needs improvement to meet the European Standard for commercial biometric systems. We believe that mouse dynamics can be a practical mechanism for continuous authentication, especially when combined with other auxiliary technologies.

### Discussion and Future Work

#### Key Takeaways

1. **Accuracy Improvement**: Although our method achieves a useful level of accuracy, further enhancements are needed. Possible approaches include developing more effective trajectory features, using a richer set of features, or employing ensemble methods.
2. **Session Length Impact**: Our study shows that session length significantly affects the performance of detectors. Longer sessions improve accuracy, but this may limit applicability for immediate-response systems. Cleaning raw mouse data could help reduce the required session length.
3. **Data Set Variability**: Different studies use varying amounts of data from different numbers of subjects, making comparisons challenging. Establishing a publicly available, standardized data set would greatly benefit the field.

### Conclusion

This work presents a novel approach to continuous authentication using mouse dynamics. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrated the efficacy of our proposed method, achieving a practically useful level of accuracy. However, a balance between security and usability is still necessary. Further investigations in more realistic settings are planned to enhance the system's performance.
