## Workshop Overview
### Kali Linux for Network Attacks
- **Topics Covered:**
  - CAM Table Overflow
  - VLAN Hopping
  - ARP Poisoning
  - DHCP Spoofing
- **Note:** If you are already proficient in these techniques, please give up your seat to allow others to participate, especially if the class is full.

## Technical Requirements
- **Pre-installed Kali Linux** (preferably as the main OS, not virtualized)
- **CAT5 cable** of sufficient length
- **Patience** as we may encounter network congestion and connectivity issues due to the room setup.
- **Duration:** 4 hours, 4 tasks, with a lot of network congestion.
- **Environment:** This is a HOSTILE NETWORK!

## Workshop Guidelines
- **Do / Don't:**
  - Everyone is here to learn, so don’t impede others.
  - Embrace other people’s genius.
  - Work as a team; this is a group effort.
  - Do not take over someone else’s keyboard.
  - We’re here to learn, not to be pedantic over terms.

## CAM Table Overflow
- **Overview:**
  - **Layer 2 (Switch):** Records MAC addresses and saves them for switching purposes.
  - **Attack Method:** Overload the CAM table to push all data out all ports, effectively turning a switch into a hub.
  - **Command to Stop Attack:** `#macof -C`
  - **Remote Internal Pentests:** Can be challenging. RDP stops working when using ettercap (hint: "timeout").
  - **Start Slow:** Gradually increase the attack to avoid impacting production.
  - **Valid Employee Subnet:** Ensure you are in a valid subnet during pentesting.
  - **Read the PCAP File:** Don’t just trust the logs.

## Usage Tips
- **Timing:** Use at the beginning of a test or to target specific systems (e.g., admin).
- **Start Slowly:** Begin with one or two minutes, then build up once you know you’re not impacting the network.

## Hands-On Lab
- **Demo:** Practical demonstration of the techniques.
- **Next Topic:** Start the next topic at the top of the hour.

## DHCP Spoofing
- **Impact:**
  - Messes up the DHCP table.
  - Can disrupt the network for hours or days.
  - Great way to create a DoS for a network.
  - Crosses routers into neighboring networks.
  - Used to pass bogus information to target systems, such as a default gateway.

## DHCP Offer Information
- **Mandatory:**
  - Client IP address
  - DHCP Address
  - Gateway IP Address
  - More
- **Optional:**
  - Lease Time (Cisco default: one day)
  - Time Server
  - Name Server
  - Domain Name Server
  - Domain Name
  - Host Name

## Implementation
- **Race Against DHCP Server:** Or starve out all the DHCP addresses of the valid DHCP server.
- **Permission Required:** Only as a last resort after obtaining permission.
- **Proof of Concept:** Suitable for small organizations.
- **Help Desk Calls:** Expect calls to the help desk.

## Hands-On Lab
- **Demo:** Practical demonstration of the techniques.
- **Completion:** Leave when done.
- **Feedback:** Please send any feedback to [PI:EMAIL].
