## Preface
On behalf of the Program Committee, it is our pleasure to present the proceedings of the 9th Symposium on Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection (RAID 2006), which took place in Hamburg, Germany, from September 20-22, 2006. Since 1998, the symposium has brought together leading researchers and practitioners from academia, government, and industry to discuss intrusion detection research and practice. This year, we had sessions on anomaly and specification-based detection, network-based intrusion detection, attacks against intrusion detection systems, IDS evaluation, and malware analysis.

The RAID 2005 Program Committee received 93 paper submissions from around the world, including 15 papers submitted as "Big Challenge, Big Idea" papers. All submissions were carefully reviewed by several members of the Program Committee and evaluated based on scientific novelty, importance to the field, and technical quality. The final selection took place at the Program Committee meeting held on June 1st and 2nd in Zürich, Switzerland. Sixteen papers were selected for presentation and publication in the conference proceedings, making RAID one of the most competitive conferences in the area of computer security.

This year, we introduced "Big Challenge, Big Idea" as a theme, encouraging submissions that described fundamental problems not yet tackled by intrusion detection research or bold, risky, or controversial ideas for potential research or solutions.

A successful symposium is the result of the joint effort of many people. We would like to thank all the authors who submitted papers, whether accepted or not. We also thank the Program Committee members and additional reviewers for their hard work in evaluating the submissions. Special thanks go to the General Chair, Dieter Gollmann, for handling the conference arrangements; Robert Cunningham for publicizing the conference; James Riordan for compiling the conference proceedings; Klaus-Peter Kossakowski for securing sponsor support; and Jan Meier for maintaining the conference website. Finally, we extend our thanks to the Northwest Security Institute (NSWI) and Cisco Systems for their sponsorship of student scholarships.
