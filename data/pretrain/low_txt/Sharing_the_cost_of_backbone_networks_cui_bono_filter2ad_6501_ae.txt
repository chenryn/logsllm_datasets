### Table 9: Network-level Discrepancy for Varying Network Upgrade Thresholds (Aggregate-Peak-Device vs. Shapley Policy)

| Threshold | 40% | 50% | 60% |
|-----------|------|------|------|
| Cost Ratio | 1.453 | 1.497 | 1.542 |
| Traffic Ratio | 0.642 | 0.673 | 0.689 |
| Cost per Mbps | 512.5 | 472.4 | 451.3 |

- **Latin American Access Providers**
- **US Access Providers**
- **Asian Access Providers**

### Summary and Implications
The analysis in Table 9 quantifies the cost ratio between the Aggregate-Peak-Device and Shapley policies for different network upgrade thresholds (40%, 50%, and 60%). The results show that the impact of the network upgrade policy on the cost ratio is modest, with the median ratio increasing by only 0.1 when the upgrade threshold is increased from 40% to 60%.

Neither the time intervals over which customer traffic is aggregated nor the upgrade policy, determined by the utilization level when a device's capacity is upgraded, have a significant impact on the discrepancies between the different cost-sharing policies.

### 5.6 Costs for Different Types of Customers
We delve deeper into the costs, focusing on the different types of customers present in our datasets. Figure 12 illustrates the cost per Mbps and peak data rate for all customers, classified into six categories: content ISPs, tier 1/2 ISPs, and EU, Latin American, US, and Asian access providers. The costs are quantified based on the Aggregate-Peak-Device policy. The figure reveals the following key properties:

1. **Wide Range of Costs**: The cost per Mbps for individual customers spans several orders of magnitude.
2. **Variability within Customer Types**: Even within a single type of customer, there is significant variability in the cost per Mbps. However, EU and US ISPs generally have lower costs compared to Latin American and Asian ISPs. This is due to the fact that EU and US ISPs primarily send their traffic to EU and US, utilizing lower-cost infrastructure.
3. **Expensive Content Providers**: Content providers consistently fall into the range of "expensive" customers, with costs exceeding $10 per Mbps. This indicates that a large portion of their traffic crosses expensive intercontinental links, which we confirmed using raw data from our datasets.

### 6. Related Work
For a comprehensive treatment of pricing in communication networks, refer to the textbook by Courcoubetis and Weber [8]. A workshop version of this work [14] focused on different cost-sharing policies in backbone networks. Our current work extends this preliminary research by:
- Proposing a methodology for cost-sharing in backbone networks and introducing different types of discrepancies.
- Evaluating the liability facet of the cost-sharing domain.
- Utilizing a richer dataset that describes the traffic patterns of a backbone network with three times more links.

Several studies have investigated ways to reduce transit costs, including ISP peering [2, 11, 10], CDNs [24], P2P localization [6], and traffic smoothing [20]. Dimitropoulos et al. [12] provided a detailed analysis of the 95th percentile pricing. Laoutaris et al. [16, 15] proposed methods to transfer traffic without increasing the 95th percentile for customers. Stanojevic et al. [27] suggested forming coalitions among transit provider customers to reduce costs. Valancius et al. [30] demonstrated that a small number of pricing tiers can achieve near-optimal efficiency for transit providers.

Motiwala et al. [21] developed a cost model for operators to evaluate routing and peering decisions. Their study complements ours, as their model can be used to assess CAPEX and OPEX costs instead of our step function (Section 3). Our primary focus is on fair and accurate distribution of costs among an operator's customers.

The net neutrality debate is closely related to the question of who bears the network costs [7]. Our work contributes to a better understanding of these costs.

Recent studies have proposed pricing and cost-sharing mechanisms using Shapley values due to their fairness properties [1, 13, 22]. Briscoe [3, 4] advocated for fair cost-sharing mechanisms to reduce cross-subsidization in communication networks [5]. Cooperative approaches for cost sharing have been explored in inter-domain routing [19, 26] and IP multicast [1, 13]. Ma et al. [17, 18] presented a fair revenue-sharing method for ISPs, quantifying the importance of each ISP in the Internet ecosystem. Stanojevic et al. [28] empirically investigated temporal usage effects using Shapley and 95th percentile methods. Our work differs in that it focuses on the costs of large customers in a backbone network with geographically diverse links, studies additional cost-sharing policies and aspects like liability and TCO, and uses a more detailed cost and traffic dataset.

### 7. Conclusions
With increasing traffic volumes, intense market competition, and technological barriers, commercial backbone operators face the challenge of maintaining healthy profit margins. Providing services to their customers, often ISPs themselves, involves significant maintenance and upgrade costs. Attributing these costs to individual customers is crucial for smooth operations and fair tariffs. However, quantifying the cost contribution in a distributed backbone network is complex, involving temporal/spatial characteristics, non-linear cost-capacity relationships, measurement issues, and high variability in component costs.

This paper aims to understand the relationship between various cost-sharing policies and their impact on individual customers. While our analysis highlights important properties of backbone network cost-sharing, many questions remain open. For example, how can the global view of cost allocation per customer be used to create simple yet profitable tariffs? Based on our findings, such tariffs should include device-level expenditures and measurements to ensure accuracy. Another open research question is how tariffs inspired by the presented cost-sharing policies would alter customer behavior, particularly in terms of traffic patterns to minimize expenditures. It would also be interesting to study if the observed properties of cost-sharing can be applied to other types of networks, such as residential broadband or 3G access networks, which are spatially less diverse but serve a larger customer base.
