### Changing the Mindset of Cyber Defense: Detecting Intent, Not Just Technique

**Vadim Pogulievsky**  
Director of Cyber Research, Verint

---

### About Me
- **Name:** Vadim Pogulievsky
- **Position:** Director of Cyber Research at Verint
- **Experience:** Over 15 years in building cybersecurity products
- **Previous Roles:** Led cybersecurity research teams at Finjan, M86 Security, and McAfee

---

### Agenda
1. Current Industry State
2. Seeing the Big Picture
3. Can It Be Better?
4. What We Should Do as an Industry to Improve It

---

### Current Industry State
- **“Hackers Attack Every 39 Seconds”**
- **“One in Three Americans Hacked in the Past Year”**
- **“Cyber Crime Damage Costs to Hit $6 Trillion Annually by 2021”**
- **“Around One Billion Accounts and Records Were Compromised Worldwide in 2016”**
- **“Cyber Crime Will More Than Triple the Number of Unfilled Cybersecurity Jobs, Predicted to Reach 3.5 Million by 2021”**

---

### Why Is This the Situation?
- **Lack of Cooperation:** We compare rather than collaborate.
- **Isolated Products:** Each security product is designed as if it were the only one in a customer's network.
- **Fragmented Ecosystems:** Customers must build a cyber defense ecosystem from products not designed to work together.

---

### High False Positive (FP) Rate: Why It Happens
- According to the Cisco 2017 Security Capabilities Benchmark Study:
  - **"Organizations can investigate only 56 percent of the security alerts they receive on a given day."**

---

### To Alert or Not to Alert: The Dilemma
- **Scenario:** I see a suspicious JavaScript (JS) file but cannot analyze it properly.
- **Question:** Will I miss a possible attack, or will I create a false positive?
- **Example:** A PDF with obfuscated JS

---

### Detecting Malicious Techniques Is Not Enough
- **Key Insight:** Understanding the intent behind the technique is crucial.

---

### Seeing the Entire Picture: A Must
- **Importance:** Only by seeing the entire picture can we understand the intent.

---

### What If It Worked This Way...
- **Collaborative Approach:**
  - **Detection:** "Hey folks, found a fishy file sending some traffic to a suspicious domain. Anyone can take a look?"
  - **Response:** "Hi there, scanned it. Don’t worry, it’s benign, on my whitelist."

---

### Interactive Conversation Instead of a One-Way Street
- **Benefits:**
  - **Ability to Answer Questions vs. Triggering Alerts**
  - **Automatic Investigation:** Investigating every single lead is too much for human analysts.

---

### First Steps in This Direction
- **Security Automation and Orchestration:**
  - **Automating Time-Consuming Tasks**
  - **Enriching Data with Internal and External Sources**
- **Next Steps:**
  - **Good Start, But Not Enough!** Let’s look further.

---

### False Positive Investigation
- **Example:**
  - **EXE File**
  - **C&C Alert**
  - **Whois Lookup**

---

### True Positive Investigation
- **Example:**
  - **EXE File**
  - **C&C Alert**
  - **Whois Lookup**
  - **Additional EXE Files**

---

### Building an Integrated Cyber Security Ecosystem
- **Components:**
  - **Detection:** One lead for an attack should be enough.
  - **Forensics Data:** Collecting in advance for future investigations.
  - **Response:** Respond in the most appropriate way.
  - **Investigation Engine:** Run the investigation process and make decisions.

---

### Summary
- **Ecosystem Instead of Siloed Products**
- **Automation as a Central Investigation Platform**
- **Every Alert Investigated**
- **Relevant Forensics Data Available for Investigations**
