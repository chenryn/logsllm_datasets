### Implications for the Networking Community

The findings presented in this paper have several significant implications for the networking community. 

First, we argue that the original version of BBR [6], which disregards packet loss, may be detrimental in contexts of persistent last-mile congestion. This is because it can place additional strain on already overwhelmed devices. Therefore, the enhancements introduced in BBR v2, such as accounting for packet loss and Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), are crucial in these scenarios [20].

Additionally, special attention must be given when using measurement platforms like RIPE Atlas. For example, geolocation studies and services based on latency [4, 8, 27] should avoid making inferences during peak hours or with probes affected by persistent last-mile congestion. More broadly, we recommend examining last-mile latency in any Internet delay study, as last-mile congestion can lead to incorrect inferences.

Although not detailed here for brevity, our observations in Japan using Atlas anchor‚Äôs delay (Appendix B) and IPv6 traffic (Appendix C) indicate that the use of IPoE (instead of PPPoE) for IPv6 in most Japanese ISPs helps bypass congested legacy devices. This suggests that the newer IPv6 infrastructure may scale better, though this could also be due to the different traffic volumes carried by each protocol. A comparative analysis of protocol performance is beyond the scope of this paper and is left for future work.

### Conclusions

In this paper, we analyzed persistent last-mile congestion and found that it consistently affects Atlas probes located in 10% of monitored Autonomous Systems (ASes), including large eyeball networks. Furthermore, we observed a 55% increase in ASes with persistent last-mile congestion during the COVID-19 outbreak. Our detailed analysis of Japan‚Äôs major ISPs, supported by CDN logs, confirmed that detected last-mile congestion significantly impacts user throughput.

### Delay and Throughput Correlation

To better understand the relationship between delay and throughput fluctuations, we cross-referenced both datasets. For congested ASes, we found clear non-linear correlations between delay and throughput, which we report using Spearman‚Äôs rank correlation coefficient. Figure 7 illustrates the relationship between delay and throughput. For ISP A (left plot), delay increases coincide with throughput decreases (ùúå = ‚àí0.6). For instance, we observe low throughput whenever the aggregated delay exceeds 1ms. In contrast, for ISP C (right plot), there is no correlation between the two metrics (ùúå = 0.0), indicating that throughput and delay fluctuations are driven by different factors.

While these results do not imply causation, they support our hypothesis and align with previous observations [19]. We argue that this is strong evidence of persistent last-mile congestion and thus validates the monitoring technique described in ¬ß2.

### Limitations

The above analysis has several limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results.

#### B. Anchor vs. Probes Delay

Another method to validate the hypothesis in Section 4 is to compare results from Atlas probes with those from anchors for networks relying on the legacy network. Since anchors are typically located in datacenters and closer to the backbone network, they do not use the legacy network. The main difference between probes and anchors hosted in the same AS is the access link. If the AS relies on the legacy network, we expect to see congestion for probes but not for anchors.

We identified one AS (referred to as ISP D) that relies on the legacy network for its broadband service and hosts both Atlas probes and an anchor. Figure 8 shows the aggregated last-mile queuing delay for ISP D‚Äôs probes (top plot) and its anchor (bottom plot). Both show near-zero delay during off-peak hours, but the probes‚Äô delay increases significantly during peak hours while the anchor‚Äôs delay remains stable. This further illustrates congestion at the legacy network.

#### C. IPv6 Throughput Analysis

For the legacy network in Japan, an alternative to PPPoE is IPoE, which is usually used for IPv6 and provides better connectivity due to more recent equipment and fewer users [19, 21]. Although not all IPv6 is over IPoE, we generally expect IPv6 to be less affected by PPPoE congestion. Figure 9 shows the IPv4 and IPv6 throughput for the three major ISPs discussed in Section 4. Overall, we found that IPv6 throughput is better than IPv4, especially during peak hours for ISP A and ISP B. IPv6 does not show performance degradation during peak hours, suggesting that the IPv6 infrastructure scales better, though this could also be due to the lower volume of traffic observed for this protocol (not shown here).
