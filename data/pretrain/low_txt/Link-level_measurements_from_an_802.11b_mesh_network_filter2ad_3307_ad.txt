### Figure 18: Packet Loss and Foreign Packets per Second

**Description:**
- **X-axis:** Number of foreign packets received per second by the receiver in a host pair (same data as Table 1).
- **Y-axis:** Number of 1500-byte packets lost per second at 1 Mbit/s.
- **Data Source:** Experiments conducted within a few minutes of each other.
- **Observation:** No obvious correlation between the number of foreign packets and packet loss.

### Impact of Delay Spreads on Packet Loss Rates

Significant delay spreads can significantly increase packet loss rates. While we cannot fully characterize the reflective paths in Roofnet, we can evaluate the impact of longer delay spreads using the channel emulator described in Section 2.1.

#### Channel Emulator

The emulator uses a two-ray channel model, where a delayed copy of the transmitted radio signal is attenuated and mixed with the original before reaching the receiving radio. This setup emulates a line-of-sight path and a single reflective path. The key parameters are the delay between the two signals and their relative strengths. In a real environment, multiple reflective rays would be present, so the emulation results likely provide a lower bound on the losses caused by reflections.

#### Experimental Setup

- **Transmission:** Batches of 200 broadcast packets at 1, 2, 5.5, and 11 Mbit/s.
- **Measurements:** Varying the delay and attenuation of the reflected ray in increments of 0.02 microseconds and 0.2 dB, respectively. The original ray was not attenuated.

### Results: Effect of Multi-Path Delay and Attenuation

**Figure 19:**

- **X-axis:** Delay of the reflected ray relative to the direct ray.
- **Y-axis:** Attenuation of the reflected ray relative to the direct ray.
- **Gray Bars:** Indicate attenuation levels resulting in 10% to 90% packet loss.
- **Black Bars:** Indicate attenuation levels resulting in ≥ 90% packet loss.
- **Observations:**
  - Delays less than a few hundred nanoseconds have little effect on packet loss, consistent with Intersil's RAKE receiver specifications.
  - Packet loss rates increase for delays above a few hundred nanoseconds due to the RAKE receiver's difficulty in distinguishing the original signal from reflections.
  - Significant losses occur at delays that are multiples of the modulation's symbol boundaries. For 1 and 2 Mbit/s, symbols last one microsecond, leading to peaks of loss at one and two microseconds. For 5.5 and 11 Mbit/s, the symbol duration is 0.73 microseconds, leading to peaks at corresponding delays.

### Compatibility with Roofnet Distances

**Figure 20: CDF of Distances Between Roofnet Nodes**

- **Median Distance:** 500 meters.
- **Quarter of Links:** Longer than 1000 meters.
- **Delay Spread:** Up to a microsecond (approximately 300 meters) is common in similar urban wireless environments.

### Implications for Multi-Path Interference

Multi-path interference can cause loss rates that are difficult to predict from signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) alone. For example, at 5.5 Mbit/s, the loss rate can vary widely depending on the exact length of the reflective path. If reflective path lengths are uniformly distributed, this uniformity could contribute to the prevalence of intermediate loss rates.

- **Eckhardt and Steenkiste [7]:** Found few links with intermediate loss rates in an indoor 802.11 network.
- **Kotz et al. [10]:** Examined whether nodes that can hear each other at all can hear each other perfectly, concluding that this assumption is nearly correct. Our measurements show that Roofnet behaves differently, possibly due to its multi-hop nature.
- **Lundgren et al. [11], Yarvis et al. [15], and De Couto et al. [6]:** Reported lower performance in multi-hop routing systems than predicted, attributing it to intermediate-quality links. They proposed solutions involving measuring link quality and careful routing.
- **Earlier Studies [14, 12, 3]:** Found bursty packet losses requiring multi-state Markov models for accurate prediction. These bursts were caused by environmental movements, which induced Rayleigh fading. Static outdoor 802.11 measurements [3] showed directional antennas susceptible to wind, causing bursty losses. Omni-directional antennas in Roofnet are less affected by weather conditions.

### Conclusions

This study examines packet loss on a 38-node urban 802.11b mesh network. Links with intermediate levels of loss are common, and there is no clear distinction between "working" and "non-working" links. Link distance and S/N ratio have a weak effect on loss rates. Experiments using a hardware channel emulator suggest that multi-path fading due to reflections is a significant cause of intermediate loss rates.
