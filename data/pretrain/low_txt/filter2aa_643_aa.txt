**The Story Begins...**

**At 23:00:**  
I decided to investigate a crimeware tool. I obtained a link from `http://pastie.org/pastes/888690` via `www.malwaredomainlist.com`.

**Features of the Crimeware:**
- Undetectable by antivirus scanners
- Randomly obfuscates the PDF payload
- Checks if the domain is on a blacklist
- Prevents decoding by tools like Wepatweb and Jsunpack
- Offers multiple exploits for high-level penetration:
  - Adobe Acrobat Reader (including CVE-2010-0188)
  - JRE (GSB & SERIALIZE)
  - MDAC (IE)
  - MS09-032 (IE)
  - MS09-002 (IE)
  - CVE-2010-0806 (IE)

**Mission 1: Try It Out**
- Objective: Understand and test the crimeware
- Step 1: Obtain a trial account

**Social Engineering:**
- Added the contact on IM
- Waited for a response
