### Names of All Applications, but No Internal Content

"When we refer to the names of all applications, we mean that we will only see the list of installed apps on a device, but not any content within those apps. For example, if you have WhatsApp, we will not see any conversations inside." (P41, Case Manager)

### Focus Groups and ISDi UI

Focus groups revealed that both clients and consultants are users of the ISDi User Interface (UI) (see Figure 2). Therefore, we avoided using language that might be confusing or intimidating to clients. Although a thorough user study of the tool has not yet been conducted, we have initiated some initial user studies with IPV support organizations (e.g., TECC [2]) interested in integrating ISDi into their procedures. This is discussed further in Section 8.

### Configuration Checks and Privacy

This leaves the task of checking configurations of common apps that may be useful but potentially dangerous, as well as built-in system services (e.g., "Find My Phone" features), account backup mechanisms, and authentication lists (e.g., registered fingerprints), all of which can be sources of vulnerability. The same applies to online accounts deemed important by the client (e.g., email and social media accounts). Unfortunately, automating the privacy checks for these accounts is challenging due to the lack of device or web interfaces to query such data and the need to understand the context and involve the client in identifying dangerous configurations. For instance, in several cases, we found that the client's Facebook or GMail accounts had been accessed by devices confirmed to belong to the abuser.

To assist consultants with these manual investigations, we created easy-to-follow guides for popular apps, device settings, and online service settings. For example, our Google privacy configuration guide outlines steps to check a device’s login history, location sharing, photo sharing, and Google Drive backup settings. For iCloud, we check family sharing, backups to iCloud, and whether the abuser still has access to the account. We continuously update these guides based on ongoing work with clients, currently covering Android (including Google Maps and GMail), Apple (including iCloud and location sharing), Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. However, these guides may become outdated if software updates change configuration features, necessitating future work on sustainable guide maintenance (see Section 8).

### Benefits of Manual Investigations

Another benefit of conducting manual investigations during consultations is that they serve as impromptu computer security training for clients, which prior research has shown is greatly needed [19]. Many clients we met were unaware of security configuration features, and we were able to demonstrate, for the first time, that they could check which devices were logged into their GMail or Apple accounts. Clients often asked follow-up questions about security best practices, leading to open-ended discussions about computer security.

### Advising Clients on Next Steps

In the final phase of the consultation, the consultant synthesizes information from the understanding and investigation phases to assess the client’s situation and discuss potential causes of the tech problems the client is experiencing. If the investigation reveals spyware, risky software, or privacy issues with the client’s accounts and devices, these are discussed calmly with the client, including how the breach may have occurred and potential remedial actions. In such cases, the consultant provides a printout explaining the findings and their implications (see examples in the full version).

Before taking any actions or changing settings, it is essential for the client to discuss the consultation results with a professional to develop a safety plan. Ideally, this professional should be familiar with the client’s situation and abuse history to highlight potential safety issues related to tech abuse. One professional noted:

“Safety planning is highly individualized. In some cases, it might be advantageous to leave the spyware in place, while in others, immediate removal is necessary. It’s crucial to integrate this into the standard safety planning protocol.” (P37, Paralegal)

If the client’s case manager is not present, the consultant asks the client if they would like to contact their case manager or receive immediate assistance from another on-site professional. Thus, even if the consultation identifies tech problems, the client may leave with their devices and accounts unchanged. For clients with complex scenarios, we encourage them to schedule a follow-up consultation through their professional after safety planning.

### Collecting Forensic Digital Evidence

Consultations also provide opportunities for collecting forensic digital evidence. Legal professionals in our focus groups emphasized the importance of documenting tech abuse. Properly collected evidence can help secure an order of protection or aid a criminal investigation. Although clients may want to delete suspicious apps or reconfigure settings, our protocol involves discussing the benefits of documenting discoveries before taking action. Professionals suggested various approaches, such as:

“I would definitely take photos. A detective will investigate the report, but I will take photos and write down the name of the app on my report.” (P39, Police Officer)

We recommend that the client (or a lawyer acting on their behalf) take a photo or screenshot of any discovered spyware or evidence of compromises. This is the current standard of evidence in family court, and several clients we met have ongoing court cases where they plan to use evidence discovered via our consultations.

If the consultation does not reveal any tech problems, the consultant reassures the client that our methods did not find any issues. We are careful not to dismiss any unaddressed or unexplained problems. If further investigation is warranted, the consultant explains that they will follow up through the referring professional (as explained in Section 4.1).

### Consultation Summary

At the end of a consultation, the consultant completes a case summary documenting:
1. The client’s chief concerns (in their own words).
2. The consultant’s assessment of problems.
3. The results of the ISDi scan and manual configuration checks.
4. Advice or recommendations discussed with the client.

This case summary is for internal use only and provides useful documentation for the consultant or other consultants, should the client request another consultation or need follow-up.

### Replicability

Ensuring a standard of care that can be maintained across different locations and by different consultants is crucial. Our tools help systematize the assessment and investigation of tech problems. Prior work in disease diagnosis [15], surgery [42], and aviation [11] suggests that simple checklists are valuable for systematizing procedures. Checklists help consultants follow a systematic procedure despite the complexity of many client cases, both emotionally and technologically. We created three checklists: one each for before, during (see Appendix of full version), and after the consultation.

We also developed a process for training researchers involved in consultations. A 13-page training manual includes a detailed description of our protocol with example situations, discusses consultant emotional well-being and safety considerations, and covers the use of our instruments, including ISDi. Training includes reading and understanding this manual, guided introductions to our instruments, and mock consultations to gain experience. These mock consultations involve role-playing realistic scenarios, followed by group analysis and constructive feedback.

While more research can refine our instruments, our field evaluation (discussed in Section 6) indicates their immediate practical value. We have publicly released all training materials, instruments, and open-source tools as resources for other advocacy organizations supporting survivors. We are collaborating with the TECC group in Seattle [2], sharing materials and getting feedback. They have adopted some TAQ questions for use in their clinical settings, and we are working towards prototyping ISDi at their clinic.

### The IPV Spyware Discovery (ISDi) Tool

We now discuss the technical design and testing of ISDi, our IPV Spyware Discovery tool. While ISDi uses simpler techniques like blacklists and heuristics, its innovation lies in tailoring it to IPV contexts:
1. Flagging apps that, in other contexts, are not necessarily dangerous.
2. Mitigating potential discoverability by existing IPV spyware.

Regarding (1), harmful apps in IPV may include both spyware and dual-use apps (legitimate apps repurposed for spying). ISDi flags all such apps, whereas existing tools do not detect dual-use apps [8]. Regarding (2), installing an existing anti-virus app can be detected by spyware, potentially endangering victims, while ISDi is designed to be more covert.

ISDi is a Python application with a browser-based user interface (Figure 2) used by the consultant to scan a client’s devices and identify potentially harmful apps. During the investigation phase, the consultant, with the client’s permission, connects the client’s device via USB to a laptop running ISDi. This design does not require an app to be installed on the device, making it minimally invasive and leaving little trace. Further details about how ISDi works are provided in Appendix A.

### Detectability of ISDi

A key design consideration is that ISDi does not endanger victims by being detectable by abusers. We chose not to make ISDi a downloadable app because some spyware reports new app installations. Instead, we use the USB interface to connect the device to a laptop running ISDi.

We conducted additional risk assessments by installing six highly capable, overt spyware apps on an iPhone 6 (iOS 11.4) and a rooted Moto G4 Play (Android 6.0.1). The apps are: mSpy, Cerberus, FlexiSpy, SpyToApp, SpyZie, and Trackview. We inspected their features and descriptions and decided that less sophisticated apps were unlikely to detect USB connections.

For each of the six spyware apps, we created an account (simulating the abuser) and manually investigated capabilities that might detect the scanning process. We simulated normal device use and ran ISDi with and without network connectivity. We found that for five of the apps, there was no way to infer that ISDi was used. The remaining app, Cerberus, allows exfiltrating system logs on Android, but this must be manually invoked by the abuser. These logs include entries about USB connections but nothing conclusive. A technically sophisticated abuser aware of our tool and who carefully analyzed these logs might suspect, but would not have definitive evidence, that the device was scanned.

Finally, although spyware might reveal that the client visited an FJC, our consultations and ISDi do not exacerbate this risk, as clients already visit FJCs for other reasons.

### Data Collection

Although ISDi can be used without collecting any data, for research and safety reasons, we store some information, including the list of apps on a device. Importantly, we do not collect any personally identifiable information or content, such as phone numbers, emails, or photos. See Appendix A for more details.

### Field Study

After developing and refining our consultation protocol and instruments, we conducted a six-month field evaluation with IPV survivors in collaboration with ENDGBV, who helped recruit participants, provided safe space for consultations, and ensured the availability of IPV professionals for safety planning. We obtained ethics approval from our university’s IRB and ENDGBV.

### Recruitment

We distributed flyers to all five FJC locations (one in each borough of NYC), advertising the study as a way for clients to obtain a tech safety and privacy consultation. Interested clients spoke with their case manager, who, after consulting with the client, created a referral and an appointment with our team. Consultations were typically scheduled for days when our team was at the FJC, with a minimum of one and a maximum of four consultations per day. At the suggestion of ENDGBV staff, we provided $10 compensation to cover transportation costs.

### Procedure

Consultations took place in a private room at one of the FJCs. Each consultation was conducted by a team of two or three researchers: one focused on communication with the client, another on the technical aspects (ISDi scan, manual privacy checks), and a third (when available) to take notes. Clients were advised to bring any digital devices they wished to have checked. Two participants did not bring all their devices to their first consultation and made an appointment to return with additional devices. Thus, two clients participated in two consultations.

Consultations lasted between 30 minutes and two hours. We began by introducing the team members, explaining the study’s purpose, outlining the activities, and discussing the data collection.
