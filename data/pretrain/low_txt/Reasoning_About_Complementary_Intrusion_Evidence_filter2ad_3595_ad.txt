## Detection and False Alert Rates
The detection rate and false alert rate are depicted in Figure 7, which shows the performance of three different methods: raw alerts, verification without aggregation, and verification with aggregation. The x-axis represents the threshold (0.01), while the y-axis shows the rates in percentage.

**Figure 7. Detection Rate and False Alert Rate**
- **Detection Rate (%)**
  - Raw Alerts
  - Verification Without Aggregation
  - Verification With Aggregation

- **False Alert Rate (%)**
  - Raw Alerts
  - Verification Without Aggregation
  - Verification With Aggregation

## Confidence Ratio Changes

Figure 8 illustrates the changes in confidence ratios for five attack scenarios before and after applying the proposed techniques. The confidence ratios for successful attacks are significantly increased, while the confidence in other alerts (false alerts and failed attack attempts) either remains the same or decreases.

**Figure 8. Confidence Ratio Changes**
- **Scenario 0**
- **Scenario 1**
- **Scenario 2**
- **Scenario 3**
- **Scenario 4**

## Accuracy of Hypotheses

Table 1 summarizes the accuracy of ten hypotheses made during the analysis of the five attack scenarios. Six out of the ten hypothesized attacks were actual successful attacks missed by Snort, and one was a failed attack attempt. Among the seven real attacks, we have definite confidence that four of them must have occurred based on the alert evidence.

**Table 1. Accuracy of Hypotheses**
- **Scenario 0**: 75%
- **Scenario 1**: 100%
- **Scenario 2**: 50%
- **Scenario 3**: 100%
- **Scenario 4**: 50%

## Comparison with Existing Techniques

### M2D2 and Mission-Impact-Based Correlation
- **M2D2 [20]**: Provides a formal model to represent intrusion-related information.
- **Mission-Impact-Based Method [23]**: Requires human experts to specify correlation models.
- **Our Method**: Automatically constructs Bayesian networks of IDS alerts and complementary evidence based on individual attack knowledge.

### Other Approaches
- **[22]**: Hypothesizes about missed attacks based on pre/post-conditions of known attacks.
- **[8, 21, 28]**: Focuses on IDS alerts without using additional information sources.
- **Our Approach**: Utilizes both pre/post-conditions and available system states, leading to more concrete results.

### Alert Correlation Techniques
- **Clustering-based Methods [7, 29]**: Cluster alerts based on attribute similarities.
- **Concept Hierarchy-based Methods [17, 18]**: Correlate alerts using hierarchies of concepts.
- **Attack Scenario Matching [13, 9]**: Uses languages like STATL and LAMBDA to match alerts against known attack scenarios.
- **Vulnerability Analysis [25]**: Focuses on identifying possible sequences of attacks rather than reasoning about intrusion evidence.

## Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we developed a method to integrate and reason about complementary intrusion evidence, including IDS alerts, system monitoring reports, vulnerability scanning tools, and human observations. By leveraging the interdependencies between attacks and system states, we constructed Bayesian networks to infer uncertain IDS alerts. We further refined these networks through alert aggregation and abstraction, enhancing our ability to reason about successful attacks and use complementary evidence effectively. Our initial experimental results demonstrate the potential of the proposed techniques.

### Future Work
- **Dynamic Bayesian Networks**: Investigate the use of dynamic Bayesian networks for processing streams of IDS alerts and other intrusion evidence.
- **Handling Missed Attacks**: Develop approaches to handle attacks missed by IDSs.
- **Large-Scale Experiments**: Conduct experiments with large sets of intrusion evidence to improve performance.
