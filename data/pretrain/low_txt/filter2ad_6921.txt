**Abstract**

A common characteristic of all ad-hoc networks is the presence of emergent properties. Intuitively, emergent properties are features that cannot be provided by individual network nodes alone but instead result from the interaction and collaboration among these nodes. In this lecture, we will explore the key characteristics of these properties and discuss their security implications. Several examples of emergent properties in sensor and ad-hoc networks will be presented, including key connectivity, trust establishment, and node replica detection.

We will conclude with a discussion on a new threat model, where an adversary can adaptively compromise nodes within the network. This model contrasts with previous research, which typically limited adversaries to "man-in-the-middle" attacks and relied solely on end-to-end security solutions.
