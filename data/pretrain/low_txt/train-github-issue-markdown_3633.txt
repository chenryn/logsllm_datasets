# Environment
- **Windows Build Number:** 10.0.18363.778
- **PowerToys Version:** v0.18.1
- **PowerToy Module:** PowerToys Run

# Steps to Reproduce
1. Open PowerToys Run.
2. Search for the application "Notion" (executable: `Notion.exe`), with or without the `.exe` extension.
3. Observe the search results.

# Expected Behavior
- When Notion is not running, it should appear in the search results and be selectable to launch.
- When Notion is running, it should appear as the first result in the list, even though the window title does not contain the word "Notion."

# Actual Behavior
- When Notion is not running, PowerToys Run does not find it, whereas Windows Search does. (See Figure 1)
- When Notion is running, it consistently appears as the last option in the search results. (See Figure 2)
