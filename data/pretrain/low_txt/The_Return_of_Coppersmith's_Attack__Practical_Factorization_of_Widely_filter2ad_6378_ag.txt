#### Analysis of Fingerprinted Keys in PGP Dataset
- **Fingerprinted Keys**: 2,892
- **Token-Related Identification in User ID String**: 436 (154 master keys, 340 sub-keys)
- **Key Lengths**:
  - **< 2048 bits**: 0
  - **2048 bits**: 96
  - **4096 bits**: 340
- **Vendor Recommendation**: Generate keypair outside the token (e.g., using OpenSSL) and import it for private key recovery.
- **User Compliance**: Significant number of users did not follow this advice.

#### Evidence of Other Devices Generating Fingerprinted Keys
- **RSALib Provided to External Parties**: Yes
- **Key Lengths Generated with Token**:
  - **Up to 4096 bits**: Supported
  - **Less Common Lengths (e.g., 3936-bit RSA)**: Not directly factorizable by our method

#### TLS and SCADA-Related Keys
- **Datasets**:
  - **IPv4 Address Space Scan (2012-2017)**: Servers on port 443
  - **Certificate Transparency Logs (Google, 2017-04-25)**: More than 100 million certificates
- **Fingerprinted Keys Found**: 15 (4 at 1024 bits, 11 at 2048 bits)
- **Common Name Field**: "SCADA" or related industrial monitoring system URLs
- **MSB Values**: Outside the range observed in RSALib (0x90-0xA8)

- **Manufacturing Years**: 2012 and 2015
- **Impact and Mitigation**:
  - **Read-Only Memory**: Cannot be updated
  - **Long-Term Impact**: Dependent on usage scenario
  - **Recommendation**: Check for fingerprinted keys and use longer key lengths if supported

#### Other Domains
- **Authentication Tokens (e.g., U2F)**
- **e-Health Cards and Personal Identity Verification Cards (FIPS 201 PIV)**
- **Electronic Payment Cards (EMV)**
- **EMV Standard**: Approved RSALib for use in EMV cards
- **Sample RSA Keys from 13 Payment Cards**:
  - **Bit Lengths**: 768 (3x), 896 (4x), 960 (1x), 1024 (5x)
- **Recommendation**: Analyze keys with provided fingerprint detection tool and follow recommendations in Section 5

### Mitigation and Disclosure
- **Mitigation Methods**:
  - **Algorithm Replacement**: Best long-term solution
  - **Firmware Update**: Not possible in deployed devices with read-only memory
  - **Key Generation Configuration**: Use key lengths not directly affected by the attack
  - **External Library for Keypair Generation**: Alternative option
- **Responsible Disclosure Process**: Reported to the Manufacturer
