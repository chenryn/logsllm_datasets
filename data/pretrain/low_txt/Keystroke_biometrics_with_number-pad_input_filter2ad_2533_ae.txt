### Introduction

Despite the lack of a stable platform for the hand or wrist, subjects were able to type effectively. The differentiation in keystroke dynamics, even without resting, suggests that using keystroke dynamics for authentication in banks and buildings is feasible. This study achieved a weighted improvement cost of 22.18 for 2-of-3 encore-plus-outlier detection, indicating significant progress over previous work.

### Success Factors

The success of this study can be attributed to several factors:
1. **Controlled Environment**: The experiments were tightly controlled, with each subject receiving the same instructions and typing with the index finger of their right hand. This minimized variability due to apparatus and environment.
2. **High-Resolution Data**: The data collected was high-resolution, ensuring accurate input for the classifier.
3. **Feature Selection**: We used basic combinations of key-press and key-release timings as features, which are fundamental and effective for keystroke dynamics.

### Limitations

Comparing results across different keystroke dynamics studies is challenging due to the lack of a common data set and consistent methodologies. To address this, we used the cost of error as a metric, though it does not capture the full details of the trade-off between misses and false alarms. Future work should aim to standardize evaluation metrics.

### Conclusion

This study demonstrated gains in keystroke dynamics performance, achieving 99.97% correct detections with 1.51% false alarms. We had more subjects (28) and a longer pass code (10 characters) than many previous studies, which likely contributed to our improved results. Despite these successes, there are still opportunities for further improvement, such as incorporating all fingers and a richer set of features.
