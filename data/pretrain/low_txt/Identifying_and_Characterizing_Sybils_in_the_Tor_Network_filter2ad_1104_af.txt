### Techniques for Detecting and Monitoring Sybil Attacks in the Tor Network

The techniques we have developed are not only useful for identifying Sybil nodes but also serve as valuable analytics tools to monitor and better understand the Tor network. Given the absence of a central identity-verifying authority, well-executed Sybil attacks can often go undetected. However, our complementary set of techniques significantly enhances the ability to detect malicious Sybils, thereby making the Tor network more secure and trustworthy for its users.

All our code, data, visualizations, and an open-access bibliography of our references are available online at [https://nymity.ch/sybilhunting/](https://nymity.ch/sybilhunting/).

### Exposed Malicious Exit Relays

Table 5 provides an overview of our second dataset, which includes 251 bad exit relays discovered between August 2014 and January 2016. We believe that all single relays in the dataset were isolated incidents, while sets of relays constituted Sybil groups. Sybil groups marked with the symbols ∗, †, and ‡ were run by the same attacker, respectively.

| Discovery | Month | Year | Number of Relays | Attack Description |
|-----------|-------|------|------------------|--------------------|
| Aug 2014  | 1     | 1    | 1                | The relay injected JavaScript into returned HTML. The script embedded another script from the domain fluxx.crazytall.com—not clearly malicious, but suspicious. |
| Sep 2014  | 1     | 1    | 1                | The relay injected JavaScript into returned HTML. The script embedded two other scripts, jquery.js from the official jQuery domain, and clr.js from adobe.flashdst.com. Again, this was not necessarily malicious, but suspicious. |
| Oct 2014  | 1     | 1    | 1                | The exit relay routed traffic back into the Tor network, i.e., we observed traffic that was supposed to exit from relay A, but came from relay B. The system presented by Ling et al. behaves the same [23]; the authors proposed to run intrusion detection systems on Tor traffic by setting up an exit relay that runs an NIDS system, and routes the traffic back into the Tor network after having inspected the traffic. |
| Jan 2015  | 23∗   | 1    | 1                | Blockchain.info’s web server redirects its users from HTTP to HTTPS. These relays tampered with blockchain.info’s redirect and returned unprotected HTTP instead—presumably to sniff login credentials. |
| Feb 2015  | 1     | 1    | 1                | The relay used OpenDNS as DNS resolver and had the website category “proxy/anonymizer” blocked, resulting in several inaccessible websites, including torproject.org. |
| Mar 2015  | 1     | 1    | 1                | The relay injected a script that attempted to load a resource from the now inaccessible torclick.net. Curiously, torclick.net’s front page said “We place your advertising materials on all websites online. Your ads will be seen only for anonymous network TOR [sic] users. Now it is about 3 million users. The number of users is always growing.” |
| Apr 2015  | 17∗   | 1    | 1                | Again, these relays tampered with HTTP redirects of Bitcoin websites. Interestingly, the attack became more sophisticated; these relays would begin to target only connections whose HTTP headers resembled Tor Browser. |
| Jun 2015  | 18∗   | 1    | 1                | Same as above. |
| Aug 2015  | 70†   | 1    | 1                | These exit relays transparently rewrote onion domains in returned HTML to an impersonation domain. The impersonation domain looked identical to the original, but had different Bitcoin addresses. We believe that this was an attempt to trick Tor users into sending Bitcoin transactions to phishing addresses. |
| Sep 2015  | 55†   | 1    | 1                | Same as above. |
| Nov 2015  | 4†    | 1    | 1                | Same as above. |
| Dec 2015  | 8†    | 1‡   | 1‡               | Same as above. |
| Jan 2016  | 43†   | 1    | 1                | Same as the relays marked with a †. |
