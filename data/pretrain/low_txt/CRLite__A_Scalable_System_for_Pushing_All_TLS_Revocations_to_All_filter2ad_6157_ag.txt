### Figure 8: 5th and 95th Percentile Cumulative Bytes Downloaded by Clients Using Different Revocation Checking Strategies

**Results:**
We conducted 100 simulation runs for each revocation checking strategy, with each simulated user visiting 1,000 domains drawn from the Alexa Top-1M list. 

In Figure 7, we first examine the total network delay. We observe that browsers using CRLs and OCSP experience an order of magnitude more delay compared to the CRLite user. This is expected, as each CRL/OCSP check involves additional network requests. The latency of these network requests is approximately two orders of magnitude higher than the CRLite method, which only requires a filter check (which is updated every 24 hours). CRLite does not require any work from Certificate Authorities (CAs), no changes to certificates, and no modifications to the TLS protocol, making it suitable for resource-constrained clients.

We believe that CRLite demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of complete and universal delivery of revocation information. As a service to the community, our code is available at [https://www.securepki.org](https://www.securepki.org).
