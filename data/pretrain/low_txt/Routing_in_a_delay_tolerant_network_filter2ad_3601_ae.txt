### 9.4 Performance Analysis with High and Low Bandwidth

The proposed algorithms not only minimize the delay (significantly) but also ensure that the delay is never overestimated. Consequently, all the algorithms exhibit almost the same (very high) delay when the network load is extremely high.

Figures 8(a) and 8(b) illustrate the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of message delays for two scenarios: a) high bandwidth (400 Kb/s) and b) low bandwidth (20 Kb/s). The graphs highlight the superior performance of the more sophisticated algorithms, ED, EDLQ, and EDAQ. Specifically, ED demonstrates optimal performance in high-bandwidth conditions, as indicated by the overlapping CDFs of ED, EDLQ, and EDAQ. However, in low-bandwidth conditions, ED's performance significantly degrades compared to both EDLQ and EDAQ. The nearly identical CDFs for EDLQ and EDAQ suggest that their performance remains consistent even under high load.

### 9.5 Results of Varying Radio Range

Figure 9 plots the average message delay as the radio range is increased, effectively increasing the contact volume. For this analysis, the link bandwidth was set to a high value to eliminate congestion issues due to limited bandwidth.

From the graph, it is evident that increasing the radio range reduces the average delay. This is expected because a larger radio range increases the frequency and duration of mutual contact between nodes, thereby reducing waiting times. Table 2 quantifies the increase in network connectivity as the radio range is increased, spanning nearly three orders of magnitude.

The performance difference between the simpler algorithms (FC, MED) and the more sophisticated ones (ED, EDLQ, EDAQ) is more pronounced at smaller radio ranges (i.e., when the network is more disconnected). This suggests that the benefits of smarter routing techniques are more significant in highly intermittent networks. Conversely, when the radio range is very large (and links are mostly available), the benefits of the more advanced algorithms diminish.

### 9.6 Results of Varying Buffer Capacity

Most of the algorithms discussed in this paper (except LP) do not account for buffer limitations. Therefore, we expect message drops when storage is limited. To explore this, we vary the maximum available storage at each node to evaluate the performance of different algorithms in terms of message delivery. Figure 10 shows the data delivery ratio for various algorithms as a function of storage capacity. The bandwidth is set to 400 Kb/s (high) and the radio range is 100 meters.

When storage is limited, the more sophisticated algorithms (ED, EDLQ, EDAQ) experience significantly fewer message drops compared to the simpler algorithms (FC, MED). When storage is sufficiently large, there are no drops, and all algorithms achieve a delivery ratio of one. However, when storage availability is extremely limited, most messages are dropped, and the benefits of using more advanced route selection processes are minimal. Therefore, we conclude that ED, EDLQ, and EDAQ outperform FC and MED in scenarios with limited storage, but these performance benefits may be unrealized in networks with extremely large or small store-and-forward buffering.

### 9.7 Summary

It is clear that the more sophisticated algorithms (ED, EDLQ, EDAQ) outperform the simpler algorithms (FC, MED) in terms of both delay and delivery ratio. The performance differences become more pronounced as the network becomes more intermittent. Additionally, as the network load increases, ED performs much worse than EDLQ and EDAQ due to its inability to mitigate congestion. EDLQ, which routes around congestion using only local queuing, performs comparably to EDAQ. This is encouraging from an implementation standpoint, as implementing the queuing oracle on a frequently-disconnected network would likely present a significant distributed systems challenge.

#### 10.1 Store-and-Forward Systems

Electronic mail is a natural approach for handling message delivery in frequently-disconnected environments, providing the required store-and-forward capability. However, it typically lacks robust dynamic routing. In the Internet, successful e-mail exchange (e.g., with SMTP) depends on DNS request/response transactions and reliable transport layer protocols. The mail exchanger DNS facility (MX record) provides limited routing, but it falls short of handling the dynamic routing problems discussed here. Thus, e-mail (at least Internet e-mail) is not robust to errors during message transfer and cannot handle true dynamic routing.

Before the widespread availability of Internet connectivity, the UUCP network carried news and electronic mail to a growing user community using source routing, with route selection primarily left to end-users. It was later enhanced with static routing based on shortest paths computed on a topology graph distributed via e-mail or manual entry. Fixed costs were assigned to links based on connection frequency and quality. The MED algorithm is similar to this idea.

#### 10.2 Optimization Techniques and Network Flows

The field of operations research includes numerous optimization problems involving network flows, material shipment, and scheduling. A comprehensive survey is beyond the scope of this paper. However, relevant work includes the quickest transshipment problem, dynamic multi-commodity flow problems, etc. [14]. Temporally sensitive network flow problems are often solved using traditional graph problems on time-expanded graphs, introduced by Ford and Fulkerson [9] in 1962. These graphs can capture temporal dynamics as additional nodes and edges, but they can significantly expand the search space, leading to large and complex problems.

Specifically, shortest path solutions for dynamic networks have been investigated by Orda et al. [19]. Our primary contribution has been to define appropriate cost functions in the context of the DTN routing problem. The issue of splitting (allowing message fragments to take multiple paths) and buffer constraints makes the problem more challenging. The problem is further complicated by multiple commodities, time-varying capacities, non-zero and possibly time-varying propagation delays, etc. Ogier [18] addressed the specific case of zero propagation delays with finite buffers and time-varying capacities.

In summary, although many of these aspects have been discussed individually or as subsets, the complete LP formulation taking into account all these aspects is novel.

#### 10.3 Routing in Disconnected Mobile Ad Hoc Networks

Our exploration of the DTN routing problem focuses on cases where the topology dynamics are known (or nearly known) in advance. Many systems, however, will not exhibit such predictability or will exhibit partial predictability. Efforts [13, 22, 24, 5] in the context of sensor/mobile-ad hoc networks look into providing connectivity when topology dynamics are unknown. These techniques generally employ data duplication within the network to achieve eventual delivery. Such duplication requires a way to remove unnecessary copies to reduce buffer occupancy. We believe that a hybrid approach, possibly combining some epidemic techniques with those discussed here, may be appropriate for such systems.

### 11. Conclusion

DTN routing is a rich and challenging problem that requires techniques for path selection, transmission scheduling, delivery performance estimation, and buffer management. The problem of networking on frequently-disconnected networks is receiving more attention as the desire for data connectivity in mobile devices or in regions reachable only by non-conventional network devices (e.g., motorbikes) increases. We believe that in many frequently-disconnected scenarios, communication opportunities may be predictable. The algorithms devised in this paper focus on these situations, and such systems have received little attention to date.

In this paper, we have developed a framework for evaluating DTN routing algorithms, suggested and evaluated several individual algorithms, and provided a basis for future work in the area. Our findings suggest that in networks with plentiful communication opportunities, the need for smart routing algorithms is minimal. In situations where resources are limited (contact opportunities, bandwidth, or storage), smarter algorithms may provide significant benefits. Indeed, those that account for network congestion (EDLQ, EDAQ, LP) perform particularly well in these environments. The finding that global knowledge may not be required for good performance in many cases suggests that implementing the queuing oracle (the most challenging to realize except for the traffic oracle) may not be worthwhile. This point is significant and merits further investigation. Our construction of the knowledge oracles allowed us to avoid the complexities of how routing metadata is created and propagated. In real-world situations, however, the realization of these oracles would present a distributed systems challenge, made worse by frequent network disconnections.

### 12. Future Work

Our work to date has revealed that many additional questions remain to be answered. We now discuss several of these:

- The algorithms presented here (except LP) do not account for buffer limits at intermediate nodes when determining routes. If a node has insufficient storage to hold in-transit data, that data is dropped. Flow control mechanisms could be employed to prevent such drops in some circumstances, but many existing methods for handling dynamic flow control do not work well with long propagation delays. Thus, it would appear that some form of proactive admission control may be more appropriate, but discovering the best form of this mechanism for DTNs remains open. Removal of messages at a node, either because they have expired or for application-specific reasons, is another approach for controlling buffer occupancy.
- In some environments, contacts become available opportunistically. Routing under such environments might employ techniques of epidemic routing (data replication), and the most robust solution may incorporate those techniques with the approaches described here. A related variant is when oracles provide only probabilistic knowledge about available contacts (such as a time-dependent probability distribution on waiting time). Here, we hope to leverage work from the transportation community on stochastic dynamic shortest paths [10].
- The objective function we have selected here minimizes delay, but in some scenarios, other metrics (e.g., monetary cost) may be more important. This would present the problem of how to measure the metric of interest and would again raise the implementation question for the corresponding new knowledge oracle. For the case of village networking presented earlier, this may be especially true, and this line of research is already underway. As can be seen, a rich collection of questions (both theoretical and practical) arise in the context of these types of networks.
