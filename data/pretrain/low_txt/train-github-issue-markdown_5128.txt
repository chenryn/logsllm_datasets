Seeing is believing: [Rust `Drop` Trait Documentation](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Drop.html)

The `Drop` trait documentation page contains several broken links, including `core::finally::Finallyalizer` and `collections::vec::PartialVecNonZeroSized`. These links should not be visible because `core::finally` and `PartialVecNonZeroSized` are private items.
