## Scope
This guide will cover how to download MP3s from streaming services and discuss the security vulnerabilities in "protected streaming" implementations.

## Tools
- **wget** version 1.11.4
- **Mozilla Firefox** version 3.6.3
- **HttpFox** add-on for Firefox, version 0.8.4
- **rtmpdump** version 2.1b for Windows
- **Convert FLV to MP3** version 1.0

*All tools used are available under the GNU license. Specific versions are cited but may not be required.*

## Disclosure
This presentation describes methods to download protected materials to raise awareness of the various weaknesses in each implementation. All music/media used in this demonstration has the appropriate permissions from the artists. Any illegal use of these methods by third parties is their sole responsibility. The author bears no legal responsibility for misuse of these techniques.

## Legal Statement
The following demonstration violates YouTube's terms of service, MySpace's terms of service, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), and intellectual property rights if you download copyrighted materials. **USE THESE TECHNIQUES AT YOUR OWN RISK.** The presenter, DEFCON, and any DEFCON employees are not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential damages resulting from errors, mistakes, inaccuracies, personal injury, or property damage.

## Before We Begin: Some Thoughts
- Not everything is on USENET.
- Third-party plugins are not always reliable or up-to-date.
- You should verify the integrity of your downloads (e.g., using MD5 sums).
- Be cautious of third parties that offer online conversion services, as they could inject malicious content into your media.

**Note:** This presentation is not intended to encourage piracy but rather to highlight the security flaws in "protected streaming" methods.

## RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol)
RTMP is a proprietary protocol developed by Adobe Systems for streaming audio, video, and data over the Internet between a Flash player and a server. It has three variations:
- **RTMP**: Works over TCP and uses port number 1935.
- **RTMPT**: Encapsulated within HTTP requests to traverse firewalls.
- **RTMPS**: RTMP over a secure HTTPS connection.

## RTMPE (Encrypted Real-Time Messaging Protocol)
RTMPE is a proprietary protocol created by Macromedia for streaming video and DRM. It allows secure transfer of data without SSL and is implemented in Flash Player 9.0.115 and some versions of Flash Media Server 3.

### From Adobe’s Website
“Defend against replay technologies. Replay technologies, or 'stream ripping,' have been a difficult security issue to solve because they allow viewers to directly access and record the data of a stream. Stream encryption prevents stream ripping. In the past, SSL was the only choice and was too slow for most applications. With FMS 3, we now have the RTMPE protocol, which is more efficient and easier to implement.”

“Flash Media Server communicates with its clients using the Adobe-patented Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) over TCP, managing a two-way connection for video, audio, and data. In FMS 3, you can also utilize stronger stream security with encrypted RTMP (RTMPE). RTMPE is easy to deploy and faster than SSL for stream encryption. RTMPE is just one of the robust new security features in FMS 3.”

### Adobe Describing DRM
“Digital Rights Management (DRM) has two key elements: encryption and access control. There are two ways to deliver video to a consumer: stream it or download it. When you stream video from Flash Media Server, you immediately increase your protection. Encryption with Flash Media Server is done in real-time with RTMPS (SSL) or RTMPE in Flash Media Server 3.”

## rtmpdump and Its Functionality
From the rtmpdump readme:
- **HTTP Gateway**: An HTTP server that accepts requests consisting of rtmpdump parameters, connects to the specified RTMP server, and returns the retrieved data in the HTTP response. All subsequent audio/video data received from the server will be written to a file and delivered back to the client.

## Let’s Get Started: Downloading MP3s from MySpace

### Step 1: Install HttpFox Firefox Plugin
- Install the HttpFox add-on for Firefox.

### Step 2: Start HttpFox and Go to the Target MySpace Page
- For this example, I will download an MP3 from my favorite Brooklyn-based band, "Great Tiger." Their music was initially available only on MySpace.

### Step 3: Sift Through Captured Traffic
- Search for “getSong” in the captured traffic.

### Step 4: Find and Copy the URL
- Click on the "Content" tab in HttpFox. Search through the XML file until you find a URL ending in “mp3.” Copy this URL, which is the actual location of the file hosted on their servers.

### Step 5: Download and Modify the URL
- Download rtmpdump.
- Modify the captured URL by replacing the leading “rtmp://” with “rtmpe://.”
- Run the command: `rtmpdump.exe –r [modified URL] –o “my.flv”`

### Step 6: Convert the FLV File to MP3
- Use a tool like "Convert FLV to MP3" to convert the downloaded FLV file to an MP3.

### Step 7: Enjoy Your MP3
- Listen and enjoy your newly converted MP3.

## Let’s Party Hop Onto the Next One: Downloading MP3s from YouTube

### Step 1: Install HttpFox Firefox Plugin
- Install the HttpFox add-on for Firefox.

### Step 2: Start HttpFox and Go to the Target YouTube Video
- For this example, I will download an MP3 from my favorite Brooklyn-based band, "Great Tiger," with their permission.

### Step 3: Sift Through Captured Traffic
- Search for "get" in the captured traffic.

### Step 4: Copy the URL
- Copy the URL containing the video information.

### Step 5: Download wget and Modify the URL
- Download wget.
- Modify the URL to remove unnecessary parameters. Execute the following command in wget: `wget.exe –O [myfilename.flv] “[modified URL]”`

### Step 6: Convert the FLV File to MP3
- Use a tool like "Convert FLV to MP3" to convert the downloaded FLV file to an MP3.

### Step 7: Enjoy Your MP3
- Listen and enjoy your newly converted MP3.

## Conclusion
DRM implementations often fail without special hardware on the client computer. Protected streaming, a DRM technology by Adobe, is supposed to protect digital content from unauthorized use. However, encrypted content by the Flash Media Server "on the fly" means there is no encryption of the source file. RTMPE, designed to be simpler than RTMPS, still has significant security holes, making it vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle attacks. Rtmpdump can extract RTMPE streams, and Adobe has issued DMCA takedowns of the tool. Perhaps Adobe should focus on fixing its protocol instead of issuing DMCA takedowns.
