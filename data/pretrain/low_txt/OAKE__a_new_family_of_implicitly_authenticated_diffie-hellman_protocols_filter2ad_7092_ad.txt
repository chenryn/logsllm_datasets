# A Brief Comparison Between (s, r)OAKE and HMQV

## Table 1: Summary of the Comparison

A brief comparison between (s, r)OAKE and HMQV is summarized in Table 1. In this table:
- \( t_{se} \) stands for the time required to perform one simultaneous exponentiation.
- \( t_e \) represents the time for performing one modular exponentiation.
- \( t_m \) is the time for one modular multiplication over \( \mathbb{Z}_q^* \).
- \( t_h \) is the time for one hashing operation.
- \( t_a \) is the time for one modular addition over \( \mathbb{Z}_q^* \).

For total efficiency, we only count the operations needed to compute the values \( K_A = K_B \), as all other operations are the same for both (s, r)OAKE and (H)MQV. For online efficiency, we only count the dominant operations for the online computation parts of \( K_A = K_B \) (ignoring non-dominant operations like \( t_m \), \( t_a \), and \( t_h \) for simplicity).

### Key Points
- **Parallel Subgroup Test with Pre-computation**: For (s, r)OAKE, if \( A_f^{b+c}y \) is pre-computed, we can compute \( X_d^{b+e}y \) and \( X_q \) in parallel, which amounts to about 1.2 exponentiations. (H)MQV does not support such a parallel operation.
- **Robust Embedded Subgroup Test**: This refers to the more robust Case-1 subgroup test specified in Section 3.
- **Collision Resistance**: The last item refers to the need to change the functions \( c, d, e, HK \), or parameter \( l \) to resist birthday-type collision attacks on \( h \), especially when pre-computed DH-components are exposed prior to the sessions involving them and the number of sessions is large in the system. For example, if \( |q| = 160 \), we may hope that the probability of collisions (by birthday attacks) should be at most \( 2^{-80} \).

## Future Research Directions
Finally, we end this work with some questions for future investigations:

1. **Development of NMJPOK**:
   - The design of (s, r)OAKE is based on the building tool of NMJPOK formulated in this work. An interesting direction is to develop (interactive) NMJPOK in the standard model, or non-interactive NMJPOK even in the random oracle model, and find their more applications.

2. **Security Analysis in CK-Framework Variants**:
   - In this work, we mainly analyzed the security of (s, r)OAKE in the basic CK-framework. Another direction is to analyze (s, r)OAKE in some more variants of the CK-framework introduced in recent years.

3. **Achieving Reasonable Deniability**:
   - For rOAKE, being merely based on the GDH assumption is achieved at the cost of losing reasonable deniability (and more restricted secrecy exposure). It is interesting to investigate the possibility of achieving provably-secure and reasonably deniable IA-DHKE merely based on the GDH assumption (or other standard assumptions).

4. **Computational Fairness**:
   - We introduced the concept of session-key computational fairness, which can be viewed as a first step toward a formal treatment of computational fairness for cryptographic protocols. An interesting question is to achieve computationally-fair key-exchange protocols in the standard model and to formulate and achieve more computationally-fair cryptographic protocols.
