**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Privileged Process Integrity

In Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, and later versions, the Local Security Authority (LSA) can be configured to run as a Protected Process Light (PPL). This is achieved by setting the registry key `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\RunAsPPL`. When this key is enabled, all DLLs loaded by the LSA must be signed by Microsoft to ensure their integrity. [3] [4]
