Neither `RFECV.fit` nor `GridSearchCV.fit` currently accept the `sample_weight` parameter. We recommend adding this as an optional parameter to both methods. The `sample_weight` parameter is particularly useful for handling unbalanced classification problems, as it allows for the assignment of different weights to individual samples, thereby improving model performance on minority classes.
