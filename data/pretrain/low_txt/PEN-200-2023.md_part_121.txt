**Listing 944 - Extracting the credentials for beccy with Mimikatz**
- We successfully extracted the clear-text password and NTLM hash of the domain administrator, `beccy`. Let’s store both the username, password, and NTLM hash in `creds.txt` on our Kali system.

#### 12.3.2 Lateral Movement
In this section, we will use the domain admin privileges for `beccy` to access the domain controller, thereby achieving the second goal of the penetration test.

Since we have obtained the clear-text password and NTLM hash for `beccy`, we can use `impacket-psexec` to get an interactive shell on DCSRV1. For this example, we will use the NTLM hash. Once we have a command-line shell, we will confirm that we have privileged access on DCSRV1 (172.16.6.240).

```bash
kali@kali:~$ proxychains -q impacket-psexec -hashes 00000000000000000000000000000000:f0397ec5af49971f6efbdb07877046b3 PI:EMAIL

- Listing 945 shows that we achieved all goals of the penetration test by obtaining domain administrator privileges and accessing the domain controller.

### 12.4 Wrapping Up
In this module, we performed a penetration test for the fictitious client, BEYOND Finances. The goals set by the client were to gain access to the internal network, obtain domain administrator privileges, and access the domain controller.

Once we managed to get an initial foothold in the internal network, we performed Kerberoasting to obtain the credentials of a domain user. With this account, we logged into a WordPress instance and abused a plugin to authenticate to our Kali machine. We then relayed the authentication request to another machine and obtained code execution as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. Armed with administrative privileges, we extracted the credentials of a domain admin account and successfully accessed the domain controller.

It is crucial to take detailed notes throughout a real penetration test and keep a good log of when certain actions were performed. After a penetration test, ensure that everything is left as it was. Any exploits or artifacts must be removed, or at the very least, the client should be notified about their location.

### Key Takeaways
1. **Thorough Enumeration**: Always conduct thorough enumeration. You cannot attack what you missed, so map out the entire attack surface of all accessible machines and services within the scope of the assessment.
2. **Avoid Shortcuts**: Do not skip or cut short the enumeration process to chase a quick win. This can lead to missing crucial information and potentially more promising attack vectors.
3. **Privileged Access**: Once you have obtained administrative privileges on a target system, do not jump straight to the next machine. Use these privileges to examine areas of the system that may have been previously inaccessible.
4. **Combining Information**: Combine information found on different systems and stages of the penetration test. Detailed note-taking is essential to not lose track of all the gathered information.

### 12.5 Transition to Challenge Labs

#### 12.5.1 PWK Challenge Lab Overview
This learning unit covers the following learning objectives:
- Learn about the different kinds of Challenge Labs.
- Obtain a high-level overview of each scenario.
- Understand how to treat the mock OSCP Challenge Labs.

**25.1.1 STOP! Do This First**
If you are reading this module and haven't completed all the PWK Capstone exercises, we highly recommend finishing them before proceeding. The Capstone exercises provide you with an opportunity to hack machines with specific constraints on what needs to be enumerated. By compromising single machines and smaller networks via the Capstone exercises, you will set yourself up for a more successful, effective, and pleasant experience with the Challenge Labs.

Once you have completed the Capstone exercises, make sure to read through and follow along with the Assembling the Pieces Module to begin developing a methodological framework for attacking larger networks. We recommend starting with the Challenge Labs only once the Capstone exercises and the Assembling the Pieces Module are complete.

**25.1.2 Challenge Labs 1-3**
There are two types of Challenge Labs. The first three are called scenarios. Each scenario consists of a set of networked machines and a short background story that puts those machines in context. Your goal is to obtain access to a Domain Administrator account on an Active Directory domain and compromise as many machines on the network as possible.

Each of the three scenarios progressively increases in complexity due to additional machines, subnetworks, and attack vectors. All machines contain either a `local.txt` file, a `proof.txt` file, or both. The contents of these files are randomized hashes that can be submitted to the OLP to log each compromise.

**Challenge Lab 1: MEDTECH**
- **Objective**: Conduct a penetration test for MEDTECH, a recently formed IoT healthcare startup, to find vulnerabilities and misconfigurations to increase their Active Directory security posture and reduce the attack surface.

**Challenge Lab 2: RELIA**
- **Objective**: Perform a penetration test for RELIA, an industrial company building driving systems for the timber industry. The target was attacked a few weeks ago and now wants an assessment of their IT security. The goal is to determine if an attacker can breach the perimeter and get Domain Admin privileges in the internal network.

**Challenge Lab 3: SKYLARK**
- **Objective**: Conduct a preemptive penetration test for Skylark Industries, an aerospace multinational corporation that performs research & development on cutting-edge aviation technologies. One of their major branch offices has recently been targeted by an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actor ransomware attack. The CISO wishes to further shield Skylark Industries’ attack surface.

**Note**: Challenge 3 is significantly more difficult than Challenges 1 & 2. It requires a substantial amount of pivoting, tunneling, looking for information on multiple targets, and paying close attention to post-exploitation. It is beyond the scope of the OSCP exam. If preparing for the exam is your main objective, you may wish to work through Challenges 4, 5 & 6 before returning to Challenge 3.

**25.1.3 Challenge Labs 4-6**
The second type of Challenge Lab consists of an OSCP-like experience. They are each composed of six OSCP machines. The intention of these challenges is to provide a mock-exam experience that closely reflects a similar level of difficulty to that of the actual OSCP exam.

Each challenge contains three machines that are connected via Active Directory and three standalone machines that do not have any dependencies or intranet connections. All the standalone machines have a `local.txt` and a `proof.txt`.

While the Challenge Labs have no point values, on the exam, the standalone machines would be worth 20 points each for a total of 60 points. The Active Directory set is worth 40 points all together, and the entire domain must be compromised to achieve any points for it at all.

When completing Challenges 4-6, we recommend a different approach compared to Challenges 1-3. In particular, the purpose of these challenges is to provide you with direct, intuitive insight on the types of machines that are likely to be on the exam. These challenges are not designed to be all-encompassing; not every vector that is part of these challenges will be on every exam attempt, and the exam may contain vectors that are not part of these challenges. Anything taught within PWK is fair game.

### 12.6 Challenge Lab Details

#### 12.6.1 Client-Side Simulations
The internal VPN lab network contains a number of simulated clients that can be exploited using client-side attacks. These clients are programmed to simulate common corporate user activity. Subtle hints throughout the lab can help you locate these simulated clients. Thorough post-exploitation information gathering may also reveal communication between client machines.

The various simulated clients will perform their tasks at different time intervals, with the most common interval being three minutes.

#### 12.6.2 Machine Dependencies
Some targets are not designed to be exploited without first gathering specific additional information on another lab machine. Others can only be exploited through a pivot. Student Mentors will not provide details about machine dependencies. Determining whether or not a machine has a dependency is an important part of the information-gathering process, so you’ll need to discover this information on your own.

An example of a dependency might be that a machine named VANGUARD contains a file that divulges credentials for another machine named SENTINEL. VANGUARD may not have any (intentional) external attack vectors, so you will need to compromise SENTINEL first.

**Note**: These two specific machine names do not exist in any of the Challenge Labs; they are just mentioned here by way of example.

There are no dependencies between challenges. This means that the information you find in Challenge 1 will not pertain to any of the machines in Challenges 2-6, and so on.

For the OSCP-like Challenges (4-6), there are no dependencies between the three domain-joined machines and the three standalone machines. The three standalone machines themselves also do not contain any dependencies. Thus, one way to think about these challenges (and therefore the exam) is that each contains a total of four isolated mini-environments: an AD set and three standalone machines.

#### 12.6.3 Machine Vulnerability
While some machines may be dependent on information or access that can only be obtained by compromising other machines within a challenge, some machines aren’t designed to be hacked at all. The reason these machines exist in the challenges is that in the real world, many machines you will encounter as a penetration tester will not be (easily) hackable.

However, the number of these machines is kept to a minimum; there are only a few per challenge. In addition, every machine does contain at least a `local.txt` or `proof.txt` file. This means that some machines may not have privilege escalation paths, but every machine can be accessed after obtaining Domain Administrator permissions for each of the challenges (whether or not they are domain-joined).

It is important to note that the OSCP-like challenges and the OSCP itself DO NOT contain these types of machines. On the exam, every machine is designed to be exploitable, and every machine has a privilege escalation attack vector.

#### 12.6.4 Machine Ordering
The IP addresses of the lab machines are not significant. For example, you do not need to start with 10.11.1.1 and work your way through the machines in numerical order. One of the most important skills you will need to learn as a penetration tester is how to scan a number of machines to find the lowest-hanging fruit.

Do not read into the specific octet values of the IP addresses within a challenge. If SENTINEL has an IP address of 192.168.1.5 and VANGUARD has an IP address of 192.168.1.12, it doesn’t mean that you should target SENTINEL first. It also doesn’t mean that SENTINEL is considered easier, and it doesn’t mean that VANGUARD is dependent on SENTINEL. In fact, in our hypothetical example, precisely the opposite is true!

#### 12.6.5 Routers/NAT
Each of the challenges has multiple subnetworks, with at least one external and one internal subnetwork. For each challenge, the internal subnetworks are not directly routable from the initial external network, but the external network is routable from all other networks.

You will need to use various techniques covered in the course to gain access to the internal networks. For example, you may need to exploit machines NAT’d behind firewalls, leveraging dual-homed hosts or client-side exploits. Lengthy attacks such as brute-forcing or DOS/DDOS are highly discouraged as they will render the firewalls, along with any additional networks connected to them, inaccessible to you.

A number of machines in the labs have software firewalls enabled and may not respond to ICMP echo requests. If an IP address does not respond to ICMP echo requests, this does not necessarily mean that the target machine is down or does not exist.

#### 12.6.6 Passwords
Spending an excessive amount of time cracking the root or administrator passwords of all machines in the lab is not required. If you have tried all the available wordlists in Kali and used information gathered throughout the labs, stop and consider a different attack vector. If you have significant cracking hardware, feel free to continue to crack as many passwords as you can. With “regular” hardware, every intentional vector that relies on password-cracking should take less than 10 minutes with the right wordlist and parameters.

### 12.7 The OSCP Exam Information

#### 12.7.1 OSCP Exam Attempt
Included with your initial purchase of the PWK course is an attempt at the OSCP certification exam. The exam is optional, so it is up to you to decide whether or not you would like to tackle it.

To book your OSCP exam, go to your exam scheduling calendar. The calendar can be located in the OffSec Training Library under the course exam page. Here you will be able to see your exam expiry date, as well as schedule the exam for your preferred date and time.

Keep in mind that you won’t be able to select a start time if the exam labs are full for that time period, so we encourage you to schedule your exam as soon as possible.

For additional information, please visit our support page: [OffSec Support](https://help.offensive-security.com/).

#### 12.7.2 About the OSCP Exam
The OSCP certification exam simulates a live network in a private VPN that contains a small number of vulnerable machines. The structure is exactly the same as that of Challenges 4-6. To pass, you must score 70 points. Points are awarded for low-privilege command-line shell access as well as full system compromise. The environment is completely dedicated to you for the duration of the exam, and you will have 23 hours and 45 minutes to complete it.

Specific instructions for each target machine will be located in your exam control panel, which will only become available to you once your exam begins.

To ensure the integrity of our certifications, the exam will be remotely proctored. You are required to be present 15 minutes before your exam start time to perform identity verification and other pre-exam tasks. During these pre-exam verification steps, you will be provided with a VPN connectivity pack.

Once the exam has ended, you will have an additional 24 hours to put together your exam report and document your findings. You will be evaluated on the quality and content of the exam report, so please include as much detail as possible and make sure your findings are all reproducible.

Once your exam files have been accepted, your exam will be graded, and you will receive your results in 10 business days. If you came up short, we will notify you, and you may purchase a certification retake using the appropriate links.

We highly recommend that you carefully schedule your exam for a 48-hour window when you can ensure minimal outside distractions or commitments. Also, please note that exam availability is handled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it is best to schedule your exam as far in advance as possible to ensure your preferred date is available. For additional information regarding the exam, we encourage you to take some time to go over the OSCP exam guide: [OSCP Exam Guide](https://help.offensive-security.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040165632-OSCP-Exam-Guide).

#### 12.7.3 Metasploit Usage - Challenge Labs vs. Exam
We encourage you to use Metasploit in the Challenge Labs, especially in Challenges 1-3. Metasploit is a great tool, and you should learn all the features it has to offer. While Metasploit usage is limited in the OSCP certification exam, we encourage you not to place arbitrary restrictions on yourself during the learning process. If you wish, you can experiment with limiting yourself temporarily in your initial explorations of Challenges 4-6. More information about Metasploit usage can be found in the OSCP exam guide.

### 12.8 Wrapping Up
If you’ve taken the time to understand the course material presented in the course modules and associated videos and have tackled all the module exercises and Assembling the Pieces, you’ll enjoy the Challenge Labs. If you’re having trouble, consider filling in knowledge gaps in the course material, and if you’re still stuck, step back and take on a new perspective. It’s easy to get so fixated on a single challenge and lose sight of the fact that there may be a simpler solution waiting down a different path. Take good notes and review them often. Search for alternate paths that might advance your assessment. When all else fails, do not hesitate to reach out to the Student Mentors. Finally, remember that you often have all the knowledge you need to tackle the problem in front of you. Don’t give up, and remember the Try Harder mindset!
