### Message Identifier and ECU Communication

The design of message identifiers, the ECUs (Electronic Control Units) that receive specific types of messages, and the payload syntax and semantics are typically done using sophisticated tools such as Vector Informatics CANoe. The data provided by these tools serves as an excellent data source for specification-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and our approach, thus meeting the criteria for availability.

**Linkability Concerns:**
Messages themselves do not contain information about their source or type. Therefore, a recipient needs to know at least part of the CAN matrix to decode a certain message ID. With the CAN matrix, we can identify the types of ECUs available and conduct system discovery. This information is then used for feature lookup, which includes details on which messages should be seen on which bus segment. Unfortunately, documentation in vehicular networks is not as standardized as PICSs (Protocol Implementation Conformance Statements) in BACnet, making feature lookup more complex and requiring detailed investigations and document parsing. Rule definition, however, is straightforward. Since packets do not have source or destination addresses, detection must focus on message IDs, bus segments, and payload.

**Specification-Based Intrusion Detection:**
While specification-based intrusion detection has been proposed multiple times, especially for CAN-based networks [36, 31], a structured approach to rule-mining is still missing. We see this as a promising field for our approach.

### Conclusion

As networked control technologies rapidly evolve, securing these systems faces the challenge of scaling up to a multitude of heterogeneous devices. Our research aims to automate the deployment of effective security solutions and adapt them in parallel with the lifecycle of the monitored systems. Specifically, we present a novel approach to specification-based intrusion detection for Networked Control Systems (NCSs). While current state-of-the-art solutions rely on manually crafted specification rules, we explore the feasibility of automatically mining these rules from available documentation. Tests performed on real building automation systems demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and confirm the time savings in development and deployment.
