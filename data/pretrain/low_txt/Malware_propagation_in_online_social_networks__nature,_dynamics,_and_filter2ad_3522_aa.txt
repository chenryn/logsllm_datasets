## Abstract
Online social networks (OSNs) have experienced rapid growth and have become a popular communication infrastructure for internet users. However, malware specifically targeting these OSNs is also on the rise. This study aims to investigate the characteristics of malware propagation in OSNs. We use a dataset from a real-world location-based online social network, which includes both the social graph and user activity events. Our analysis confirms that this network is typical of OSNs, suggesting that our findings can be generalized to other similar networks.

We employ extensive trace-driven simulations to examine the impact of initial infection, user click probability, social structure, and activity patterns on malware propagation. Additionally, we evaluate the effectiveness of various user-oriented and server-oriented defense schemes against malware spreading. Our comprehensive study deepens our understanding of the nature of OSNs' malware and provides insights into effective defense strategies.

## 1. Introduction
In recent years, online social networks have become a popular communication platform for internet users. According to a recent report, the top two OSNs attracted over two billion monthly visits in January 2009 [30]. Currently, there are 350 million active Facebook users, with approximately 50% logging in daily [10]. In August 2009, internet users spent 17% of their time on social networks and blogging sites [25]. Given the immense popularity of OSNs, it is crucial to understand the implications of malware propagation within these networks.

Unfortunately, such malware is not just a hypothetical threat. The trust relationships among OSN users can be exploited to spread malware. For example, the MySpace.A worm, detected in 2005, launched cross-scripting attacks, allowing an attacker to add millions of new contacts [19]. MySpace also suffered several other malware attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in Windows Metafile and Apple’s QuickTime player [19]. The Koobface worm, which first appeared in 2008, spread on MySpace and Facebook by inserting comments with fake links to malicious websites [17]. Once infected, a user's machine became part of a botnet. Other OSNs like Orkut, managed by Google, have also faced malware attacks, including MW.Orc, W32/KutWormer, and W32/Scrapkut [26]. In April 2009, Twitter was hit by a malware attack launched by a teenager [21], and the Clickjacking worm affected hundreds of thousands of Facebook accounts in May 2010 [7].

Despite the existence of malware targeting OSNs, our understanding of the characteristics of such attacks remains limited. Existing research often focuses on the impact of social structures, such as scale-free and small-world networks, on malware propagation [38, 34]. However, the speed of malware propagation is influenced not only by the friendship graphs but also by user activity patterns and initial infection locations. This study aims to unravel the effects of different aspects of OSNs on malware propagation.

Our analysis is based on BrightKite, a location-based OSN launched in 2007. The open mechanism of this network allows us to obtain both the social graph and detailed user activities, providing a unique perspective for studying malware propagation in realistic OSNs. Using this dataset, we conduct extensive trace-driven simulations to understand the effects of initial infection, user click probability, social structures, and activity patterns on malware propagation. We also generate synthetic OSNs to compare how malware spreads under different scenarios and identify key factors affecting its propagation.

## 2. Related Work
Malware propagation in social networks has been extensively studied, with most works focusing on the impact of social structures on epidemic spreading. Research on malware propagation in scale-free networks [14, 2, 9, 28] and small-world networks [34, 31, 23] has been well-documented. Specific types of social networks, such as email and instant messaging (IM) networks, have also been studied [24, 38, 20]. These studies typically use realistic network topologies but make simple assumptions about user activities.

Recent work by Faghani and Saidi [12] used simulated topologies and user activities to investigate malware propagation in OSNs. Xu et al. [36] proposed a correlation-based scheme to mitigate worm propagation in OSNs, using the social graph data from Flickr but lacking realistic user activities. In contrast, our study uses both realistic network topologies and user activities, revealing that user activity models play a significant role in malware propagation.

There have also been efforts to analyze human activities in OSNs. Benevenuto et al. [1] analyzed user activities at four popular OSNs, providing insights into user behavior. Wilson et al. [35] found that the activity graph formed by OSN users differs significantly from the social graph formed by their friendships, aligning with our conclusion that realistic activity models should be applied to study malware propagation. Guo et al. [15] found that content generated by OSN users follows a stretched exponential distribution, which is confirmed by our analysis of the BrightKite dataset.

## 3. Online Social Network Analysis
Our analysis of OSNs is based on the BrightKite dataset, collected from March 21, 2008, through September 24, 2009. BrightKite is a location-based OSN with a modest number of users. Typical activities include location updates, note posting, and photo sharing, accessible via web, SMS, and email interfaces. Li and Chen [18] analyzed the social graph and mobility characteristics of BrightKite users, and while some of our analysis overlaps, we focus on aspects relevant to malware propagation.
