**ATT&CK ID:** T1556.004  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Network Device Authentication

Adversaries may use the "Patch System Image" technique to hard-code a password into the operating system, thereby bypassing native authentication mechanisms for local accounts on network devices. This method allows unauthorized access by embedding credentials directly into the device's firmware or configuration, rendering standard security controls ineffective.
