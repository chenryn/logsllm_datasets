### Account Lockout Policies and Conditional Access

**Description:**
Implement account lockout policies to prevent passwords from being guessed after a certain number of failed login attempts. However, overly strict policies may lead to denial of service conditions, rendering the environment unusable as all accounts involved in the brute force attack could be locked out. To mitigate this, use conditional access policies to block logins from non-compliant devices or from outside defined organizational IP ranges.
