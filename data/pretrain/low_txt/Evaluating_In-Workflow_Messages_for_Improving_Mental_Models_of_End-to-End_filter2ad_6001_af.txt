### Messages Used in the Survey Study

#### Long Message
Unlike many other messaging apps, messages in TextLight are end-to-end encrypted. This ensures that only you and the person you’re communicating with can read the messages you send and receive. Nobody in between, including employees at TextLight, can see the content of your messages.

This is because the encryption and decryption of messages in TextLight occur entirely on your device. Before a message leaves your device, it is secured with a lock, and only you and your recipients have the keys to open and read the message. These keys are kept only on your devices, so TextLight never has access to them.

Not all messaging apps use end-to-end encryption. For example, SMS messaging is not encrypted. Apps that do not use end-to-end encryption can access, read, or change your messages, or even sell your private conversations to other parties. TextLight, with end-to-end encryption, guarantees that your messages cannot be sold because we do not have access to your unencrypted messages in the first place. With end-to-end encrypted messaging, privacy is not just a promise; it is mathematically ensured.

It’s important to note that TextLight and end-to-end encryption cannot protect against all possible privacy threats. Parties such as TextLight and your internet service provider (Verizon, T-Mobile, etc.) may be able to tell that you are exchanging messages with someone, even if they can’t see what the messages say. Moreover, end-to-end encryption cannot protect you from someone who gets their hands on your unlocked phone or from a hacker who has successfully installed malicious software. TextLight also does not prevent your correspondent from publishing the messages you have exchanged.

#### Medium Messages

**m1: No Confidentiality**
Messages in TextLight are end-to-end encrypted. Before a message ever leaves your device, it’s secured with a lock, and only you and your recipients have the keys to open the message and read it. These keys are kept only on your devices, so TextLight never has access to them.

Apps that do not use end-to-end encryption can read, change your messages, or even sell your private conversations to other parties. With end-to-end encrypted messaging, privacy isn’t just a promise; it’s mathematically ensured.

Moreover, end-to-end encryption cannot protect you from someone who gets their hands on your unlocked phone or from a hacker who has successfully installed malicious software.

**m2: No Endpoint Weakness**

#### Short Messages

**Confidentiality (s.conf)**
Messages in TextLight are end-to-end encrypted. This ensures that only you and the person you’re communicating with can read the messages you send and receive. Nobody in between can see the content of your messages.

**Metadata Weakness (s.meta)**
Messages in TextLight are end-to-end encrypted. However, parties such as TextLight and your internet service provider (Verizon, T-Mobile, etc.) may be able to tell that you are exchanging messages with someone, even if they can’t see what the messages say.

**Endpoint Weakness (s.endpt)**
Messages in TextLight are end-to-end encrypted. However, end-to-end encryption cannot protect you from someone who gets their hands on your unlocked phone or from a hacker who has successfully installed malicious software.

**Mechanism (s.mech)**
Messages in TextLight are end-to-end encrypted. Before a message ever leaves your device, it’s secured with a lock, and only you and your recipients have the keys to open the message and read it.

**Risks (s.risk)**
Messages in TextLight are end-to-end encrypted. However, not all messaging apps use end-to-end encryption. Apps that do not use end-to-end encryption can read, change, or even sell your messages to other parties.

#### Control Message
TextLight is a messaging app focused on speed and accuracy. It is super-fast, simple, and free. You can use TextLight on all your devices simultaneously, and your messages sync seamlessly across any number of phones, tablets, or computers.

With TextLight, you can send messages, photos, videos, and files of any type (doc, zip, mp3, etc.), as well as create groups for up to 200,000 people or channels for broadcasting to unlimited audiences. You can write to your phone contacts and find people by their usernames. As a result, TextLight combines the features of SMS and email and can handle all your personal or business messaging needs. Additionally, we support voice calls.

### Messages Used in the App Study

#### Short Messages

- **Confidentiality**: Messages in TextLight are end-to-end encrypted. End-to-end encryption ensures that only you and the person you’re communicating with can read the messages you send and receive. Nobody in between can see the content of your messages.
- **Metadata Weakness**: Even though messages in TextLight are end-to-end encrypted, parties such as TextLight and your internet/mobile service provider (Verizon, AT&T, etc.) may still be able to tell that you are exchanging messages with someone, even if they can’t see what the messages say.
- **Endpoint Weakness**: We use end-to-end encryption in TextLight to keep your messages safe, but end-to-end encryption cannot protect you from someone who gets their hands on your unlocked phone or from a hacker who has successfully installed malicious software on your phone.
- **Mechanism**: End-to-end encryption ensures that before a message ever leaves your device, it’s secured with a lock, and only you and your recipients have the keys to open the message and read it. Messages in TextLight are end-to-end encrypted.
- **Risks**: Not all messaging apps use end-to-end encryption. Apps that do not use end-to-end encryption can read, change, or even sell your messages to others. That’s why we always use end-to-end encryption in TextLight.

### Mapping of Educational Messages to Findings of Our Previous Work [9]

A mapping between suggestions in our previous work and educational messages in this work is provided below. All short messages mentioned below are also included in the Long message.

- **Confidentiality**: We previously suggested that users find confidentiality the most important aspect of e2e encryption. We emphasize this point in s.conf and s.mech.
- **Risks**: We directly communicate the risks of not using e2e encrypted systems with s.risk. Our previous work noted that conveying the risks of not using e2e encryption was important and surprising to multiple users.
- **Mechanism**: We dedicate a short message to the inner workings of e2e encryption (s.mech). As suggested previously, we use a brief analogy and emphasize that this mechanism ensures confidentiality. This aims to strike a balance between users who want to learn more about the technical aspects of e2e encryption and those who are confused by it.
- **Endpoint and Metadata Weaknesses**: We had previously suggested that it is important to mention weaknesses of e2e encryption, which we achieve with s.meta and s.endpt. s.endpt emphasizes that the endpoints aren’t protected by e2e encryption, and s.meta conveys that e2e encryption by itself does not protect metadata. Although metadata weakness wasn’t emphasized in our prior work, we think it’s an important limitation of e2e encryption and therefore include it.

In addition, we follow other recommendations such as avoiding integrity and authenticity topics, employing risk communication methods, and integrating the messages in regular communication workflows.
