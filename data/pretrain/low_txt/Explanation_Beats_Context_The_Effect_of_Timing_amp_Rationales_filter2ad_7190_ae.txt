### Advantages of a Consistent Approach

A key advantage of adopting a consistent approach to permission requests is that users will not be surprised or annoyed by such requests, as they will know when to expect them. Given the similarity between requesting permissions on Android and iOS, this solution is also feasible for iOS. However, it is important to note that any design changes to the mobile operating system must guard against malicious developers who might provide misleading or erroneous in-context timings and rationales. This concern is orthogonal to our work. The actual design and evaluation of such systems are part of future research.

### Rationale Origin Misconception

While the majority of participants identified the developer as the author of rationale messages, a significant number (37%) still believed that the rationales were created by the operating system. This misconception may be a side effect of using standardized rationales in our user study. In iOS, rationale messages are already integrated into the standard permission dialog [62]. Therefore, we recommend adding an indicator that the rationale is provided by the app developer. For example: “{App name} says: {Rationale message of the app developer}.” This solution is only applicable when the rationale is standardized by the operating system, as in iOS. In contrast, on Android, only the app developer can highlight the origin of the rationale (e.g., through custom themes and wording).

### Generalizability of Our Findings

When interacting with modern technology, users often face security and privacy-related decisions. These decisions must be informed and consistent with users' individual values and preferences. Previous research has focused on providing comprehensive privacy policies (e.g., "privacy nutrition facts" [63]) and effective browser security warning messages [60, 64, 65] to offer more transparency. Consistent with these findings, we found that users made better-informed decisions and were more satisfied with their decisions when provided with rationales and, to a lesser extent, when permissions were requested at appropriate times. Our results align with previous work in the mobile domain, which emphasizes the importance of transparency in users' decision-making processes [19, 16, 66-68]. These research results may also explain the recent efforts by major mobile operating systems to increase transparency, such as introducing "privacy labels" in iOS and an upcoming safety section in Google Play [69].

### Recommendations for Future Research

In line with these efforts, we recommend that developers always provide rationales. However, future research is needed to determine the optimal frequency of displaying these rationales, possibly leveraging machine learning to learn individual preferences [29, 30]. For instance, a user who consistently denies a certain permission or denies permissions for certain app types may not need additional rationales. We believe that our findings on rationales are applicable to other security and privacy-critical decisions. While the specific design of rationales may vary, they must strike a balance between adequately informing and overwhelming users. Since our results show that just the presence of rationales is beneficial, future work could explore the magnitude of this effect based on different rationale designs and contents.

### Threats to Validity

As with any empirical study, there are aspects of our study design that may limit the generalizability of the results. First, our data was collected in a highly standardized, somewhat artificial situation, which may not fully reflect the behavior of users in real-world apps. However, such experimental methods, which provide conscious control of all aspects of a situation, allow for the direct inference of causal relationships [39]. To address potential negative effects, we followed best practice recommendations for experimental studies [70], including providing participants with a consistent storyline, clear goals, and interactive mockup apps to ensure high immersion and generalizability.

Second, the topic of permission requests was obvious to participants at several points, which may have primed their behavior. For example, we asked participants about a permission before app interaction, which was necessary to measure variables like permission sensitivity, predictability, and clarity. From the users' perspective, this is similar to checking permissions in the app store before installation. Another potential priming effect could result from participants going through the main part of the study for several apps. We mitigated carryover and order effects by randomizing the order of permission request types and verifying that the order did not affect our results.

### Conclusion

In this work, we demonstrated that the timing of permission requests and the presence or absence of rationales significantly impact users' permission decisions and their evaluation of those decisions. We found that the effects of timing and rationales are interdependent and should not be evaluated in isolation. Based on our results, we suggest refining current Google guidelines to better assist users in their decision-making process. Additionally, we highlight that permission decisions depend on individual user characteristics, indicating that there is no one-size-fits-all strategy. As a conclusion, current mobile platforms could benefit from a customized solution where users can define when permissions should be requested and whether rationales should be provided.
