### The Application and Network Layers

Several studies [15, 26, 33, 40, 44, 45] require direct access to (encrypted or unencrypted) network traffic to infer video Quality of Experience (QoE). In contrast, our approach is independent of network traces and relies on low-cost signal and throughput measurements for rapid QoE prediction. Few publicly available QoS datasets include synchronous Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) measurements. For example, [17, 48, 63] analyze network traces that contain performance indicators captured during streaming sessions and experiment metadata from mobile broadband networks. However, these datasets are limited in the types of data points they provide, primarily focusing on dense, urban locations, with minimal to no measurements from under-provisioned or remote networks.

We believe it is challenging to use existing datasets, which are primarily from urban scenarios, to evaluate diverse network conditions, due to the non-overlapping and non-scalable nature of prior measurements or the lack of a comprehensive and representative dataset. The accuracy of our models, given the inexpensive measurements, indicates the feasibility and scalability of our approach.

### Limitations of Prior Work

Previous work on mapping RSRP to QoE has notable limitations. For instance, [10] presents a mapping derived solely from simulated experiments. The authors of [47] explore the effect of radio link quality, such as RSRP, on streaming video QoE. However, their results are limited in scope because they stream a custom video hosted on their own server, omitting the evaluation of popular streaming services like YouTube or Netflix. This omission means their work does not accurately capture the application and network performance experienced by actual users. [9] conducts a study similar to ours but with a modest dataset limited to a small portion of a local transit route, making it difficult to generalize.

### Conclusion

Through an extensive measurement campaign, we have collected 16 datasets with widely varying performance profiles. Our dataset includes:
- The variability of mobile broadband performance due to sparse deployments or network congestion.
- Representation of communities most likely to be dependent on mobile broadband, such as rural areas.

Our analysis highlights the challenges of quantifying QoE metrics at scale, particularly in remote locations. To address this, we developed learning models that use low-cost and easily accessible QoS data (LTE-specific RSRP and throughput) to predict QoE metrics. These models can be generalized to video content from different genres and to other locations with similar network characteristics.

The observed efficacy of the models indicates that video QoE can be more easily and scalably determined in difficult-to-assess regions using low-cost QoS measurements. For example, given the increased load on video streaming platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic [50], cellular operators could employ our approach to detect sectors with possible bottlenecks without relying on user feedback or complaints, especially in remote locations. This could lead to faster turnaround times for network troubleshooting [55], potentially reducing outage periods for users heavily dependent on video streaming.
