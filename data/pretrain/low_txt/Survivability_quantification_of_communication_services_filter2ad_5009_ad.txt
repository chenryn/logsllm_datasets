#### Transition Probabilities
- \(q_{ij}(I) = q_{ij}(IV) = a\)
- \(q_{ij}(II) = q_{ij}(III) = b\)

### Performance Evaluation

The performance of the virtual connection is evaluated after the failure of node 4 at time \(t = 500\). Each node is an M/M/1/\(n_i\) system with parameters given in Table 2. The phased recovery model parameters are:
- \(\alpha_d = \alpha_u = 0.01\)
- \(\tau = 0.001\)

The network example is studied using simulations and one analytic approach. The estimated performance metrics from 90 simulation replicas (Simulations) are compared with the analytical values of the time-space decomposed model (Decomposed CTMC model). The results are shown in Figures 9(a) and 9(b) for the loss probability and average number of packets in the system at different times \(t\), respectively.

### Results

- **Figure 9(a):** Loss Probability, \(l(t)\)
- **Figure 9(b):** Number in the System, \(N(t)\)

**Figure 9(a)** includes a "rerouting model" where \(r(t) = q(1, 4)e^{-\alpha_d t}\). This represents the probability that a packet is lost in the failed node at time \(t\) after the instant of failure. The results show almost perfect overlap between \(r(t)\) and \(l(t)\) from (2), indicating that with very low steady-state packet loss probability, the transient loss probability is dominated by \(q(1, 4)\) with a decay rate equal to the reciprocal of the expected rerouting time \(1/\alpha_d\).

### Closing Remarks

The time-space decomposed model with the closed-form solution significantly simplifies the modeling of large networks with large, even infinite, buffers. The cross-validation of our analytical and simulation models, along with the approximations of the decomposed analytical models, has been conducted. The results from the survivability studies show that when the transient performance impairment is dominated by a failure event, the decomposed, product-form approximation is a viable approach.

In cases where space decomposition is inaccurate, time decomposition should still be considered as it significantly reduces the complexity of the transient solution. Future work will relax the assumptions in our models to allow for multiple failures, general distributions, and multiple virtual connections. The approach is currently being applied to a larger network to obtain transient delay distributions, and routing probabilities are being imported from ns-2 simulations before and after a failure and repair. This ongoing research shows promising preliminary results.
