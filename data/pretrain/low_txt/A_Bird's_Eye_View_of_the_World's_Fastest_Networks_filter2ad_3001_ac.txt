### Comparison of WH and NLN Networks

**Alternate Path Availability (APA):**
As shown in Table 3, WH has a higher APA compared to NLN. This means that WH offers more alternate paths in case certain links become unavailable due to bad weather conditions, interference, or other unforeseen events.

**Link Lengths:**
For each network, we computed all loop-free paths between CME and NY4 that achieve latency within 5% of the c-speed latency along the geodesic. Figure 4(a) plots the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of tower-to-tower link lengths for all microwave (MW) links on these paths. The median link length for WH is 36 km, which is 26% lower than the median link length for NLN (48.5 km). This shorter link length makes WH more robust to signal attenuation.

**Operating Frequencies:**
Figure 4(b) shows the frequencies used between CME and NY4 for MW links on the shortest path for each network. WH primarily uses the 6 GHz frequency band, with more than 94% of the frequencies being under 7 GHz. In contrast, NLN primarily uses the 11 GHz band. To illustrate the value of lower frequencies for reliability, we also analyzed the frequencies on alternate paths for NLN, using the same alternate paths as above. On these paths, at least 18% of the frequencies lie in the 6 GHz frequency band.

**Summary:**
Along each of the three metrics tied to reliability—alternate path availability, link lengths, and operating frequencies—WH scores higher than NLN. Although WH’s latency is slightly higher than NLN’s by a few microseconds on the shortest path, WH could offer lower latencies than NLN in challenging conditions. The most competitive trading firms may even use a combination of both services to maintain their advantage in varied conditions.

### Future Outlook
We see no reason to expect the high-frequency trading (HFT) race in the Chicago–New Jersey corridor and other similar segments to come to a halt soon. Instead, networks are likely to continue competing on ever-smaller latency differences. Future analyses of such networks could explore the following avenues:
- **Entity Identification:** Identifying the entities behind the licenses by analyzing items like the licensee email addresses and other publicly available information.
- **Joint Analysis:** Using the above information to identify which licensees are likely to be co-owned and operated by one entity, and thus perform a joint analysis of their owned infrastructure.
- **Complex Tradeoffs:** Link lengths exhibit a complex tradeoff: longer links allow cheaper builds using fewer towers but are also less reliable.
- **Frequency Strategies:** Lower operating frequencies reduce weather disruptions. If the shortest path needs to operate at higher frequencies to cater to bandwidth demands, alternate paths may use lower frequencies, as seen in NLN’s strategy.

### Related Work
**Financial Trading Activity:**
Past work [34] in the financial sector has found correlations between trading activity in the Chicago–NJ corridor and latency improvements as HFT players migrated from fiber to licensed MW networks. Our work sheds light on the current state of the landscape and adds a longitudinal analysis of the evolution of HFT networks. Unlike past work, our study is network-centric and discusses design variations such as link lengths, frequencies, and path redundancy. Additionally, our code and data are publicly available [14].

**HFT Blogs and News:**
Various web resources discuss interesting anecdotes and insights into HFT networks [3–5]. However, none of these sources present a systematic way to collect and analyze information on these networks, often relying on esoteric sources such as details of court cases on real estate close to data centers. In contrast, our work conducts a systematic analysis based on publicly available FCC filings data.

**cISP:**
A recent manuscript [8] proposes low-latency terrestrial MW networks to augment the Internet’s fiber. The network topology, constrained by a budget, is designed to reduce aggregate end-to-end latency. Our findings suggest reliability enhancements for such work, and our longitudinal analysis may also help with considerations of incremental deployment.

**Radio Networks as 5G Backhaul:**
With the advent of 5G, companies are offering microwave and millimeter-wave technologies [1, 16, 17, 30] for cellular backhaul at the edge of the Internet. While in urban settings these are aimed at enhancing capacity, in rural areas [2, 46] such MW networks are being deployed to extend connectivity. These networks may benefit from our analysis of strategies for resilience.

### Conclusion
Using a systematic analysis of regulatory filings, we reconstructed high-frequency trading networks in the Chicago–New Jersey trading corridor. These networks operate at nearly the c-speed lower bound on latency, and as we show, compete on sub-microsecond latency differences. Our longitudinal analysis also reveals that this is a surprisingly active ecosystem, with networks pursuing varied design strategies. To aid future work in this direction, we make our code and data publicly available.

### Satellite Networking
Companies like SpaceX [44] and Amazon [31–33] are deploying low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite mega-constellations for offering broadband Internet. As these satellites can be as little as 300 km above the Earth’s surface and benefit from line-of-sight connectivity across satellites in space, they can offer much lower latencies than the Internet’s fiber over long distances. The schematic in Figure 5 compares an LEO constellation path and a terrestrial MW path. Even with the overhead of going up and down a few hundred kilometers for LEO connectivity, MW networks still provide lower latency. However, this may not be the case across the ocean, where it is difficult to build terrestrial MW connectivity. Recent work shows that for some HFT-relevant segments like Frankfurt–Washington DC, LEO constellations may offer superior latencies than today’s HFT networks [7].

We interpret this prior work as implying that the HFT industry could be among the first adopters of LEO constellations, particularly for longer high-value segments like Tokyo–New York. HFTs may thus open the door for wider Internet applicability of these networks. Past satellite networking efforts failed partly due to the failure to generate revenue in early operations [6]. If HFTs share LEO networks with other Internet applications, these networks may need special attention to low latency, together with isolation of HFT traffic. The other, less likely scenario, is entirely HFT-focused satellite networks.

### Non-HFT Terrestrial MW
MW networks are already used for mobile backhaul and increasingly, rural connectivity [29, 46], because the build-out is much faster and cheaper than laying fiber. There is also a latency advantage, although with the downside of more limited bandwidth. Recent work proposes augmenting the Internet with a MW backbone to achieve the best of both worlds—using MW links for a small amount of latency-sensitive traffic while using fiber for other high-volume traffic [8].

While the sub-microsecond competition of HFTs is immaterial to these efforts, the radio improvements and lessons on link redundancy (§5) are certainly relevant. Such networks should be engineered towards high APA using redundant MW links close to the shortest paths.
