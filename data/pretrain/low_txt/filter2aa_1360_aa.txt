**About the Author: Michael Bazzell**

Michael Bazzell spent over 20 years investigating computer crimes for the government. He was assigned to the FBI's Cyber Crimes Task Force, focusing on online investigations and open-source intelligence (OSINT) collection. As a federal officer through the U.S. Marshals Service, he was involved in major criminal investigations, including online child solicitation, child abduction, kidnapping, cold-case homicide, terrorist threats, and advanced computer intrusions. He has trained thousands in investigative techniques and privacy control strategies.

After leaving government work, he served as the technical advisor for the first season of the television hacker drama *Mr. Robot*. His books *Open Source Intelligence Techniques* and *Extreme Privacy* are used by several government agencies as training manuals. He now hosts the weekly *Privacy, Security, and OSINT* show and assists clients in achieving ultimate privacy, both proactively and in response to undesired situations. More details can be found on his website, IntelTechniques.com.

**Preface to the Ninth Edition**

I have poured every tactic, method, and experience into this special hardcover expanded edition. This book was accurate as of January 1, 2022. If you find techniques that no longer work, use the overall lessons to adapt and locate your content. Once you understand the strategies, you will be ready to adapt. I hope you find something valuable here to aid your online investigations or research. I am excited to introduce a new level of OSINT.

Please note that this edition was put through only two rounds of editing due to hard deadlines and book piracy concerns. If you find any typos, please report them to errors@inteltechniques.com. My team can correct them for future printings. If you purchased this print edition, thank you. You represent a shrinking society. If you downloaded this book from an unauthorized site, be cautious. Many readers reported that poorly-scanned PDFs of the previous edition were infected with trackers and malicious code. Never download or open documents from untrusted sources.

The previous (eighth) edition was originally written in late 2020. After declaring a break from writing, I was asked to update this book as it is required reading for many college courses, university degrees, and government training academies. This edition deviates from my usual 30% new and 30% updated content rule, with only 20% new material and 80% recycled from the previous edition. Much of the eighth edition content was still applicable and needed minor updates. I have added new OSINT methods and removed outdated content.

My primary goals with this new edition are three-fold:
1. Continue the path of self-reliance introduced in previous editions, introducing a completely rebuilt Linux OSINT virtual machine.
2. Rework the various OSINT techniques presented throughout the book to address changes in online services.
3. Remove all outdated content to prevent frustration with broken techniques.

Keeping a book up-to-date on internet information access is challenging, as websites constantly change. However, new resources appear, and this book contains many new techniques not previously available.

**Introduction: Open Source Intelligence Techniques**

**What is OSINT?**

This book includes several hundred free information and software sources that can identify personal information about anyone you might be investigating. All resources are 100% free and open to the public, with a few minor exceptions. Each method is explained, and creative search techniques are detailed. Actual case examples are provided to demonstrate the possibilities within the methods. The book can be read in any order and referenced when needed. It is a guidebook of techniques I have found successful in my investigations.

Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is defined as any intelligence produced from publicly available information collected, exploited, and disseminated in a timely manner to an appropriate audience for a specific intelligence requirement. For the CIA, it may mean information from foreign news broadcasts. For an attorney, it may mean data from official government documents. For most people, it is publicly available content from the internet.

Locating this free online information is not the final step of OSINT analysis. Appropriate collection and reporting methods will be detailed. Whether the data is for an investigation, background check, or identifying problem employees, you must document all findings. Websites may shut down, or data may be removed, so preserve anything of interest. The free software solutions presented here will help with that. OSINT search techniques apply not only to websites but also to free programs that automate data search and collection. These programs and application programming interfaces (APIs) will be explained to assist advanced investigators.

This book serves as a reference guide to conduct more accurate and efficient searches of open-source intelligence. It is not a debate on opinions about online reconnaissance, a historical look at OSINT, or a discussion of administrative policy. It is not a how-to guide for criminals to steal identities. Nothing in this book discusses illegal methods.

As my company continues to provide OSINT training sessions, the audiences grow every year. It is no longer a course for tech-savvy employees; we see people with minimal online experience being thrown into investigation and analyst positions. Search techniques are more fickle than ever, and I am concerned about losing online resources.

I taught my first OSINT course in 1999 to a small group of local police chiefs in Illinois. I had not heard of the term OSINT and did not realize there was an official name for the methods I was teaching. Times have changed, and OSINT is now a buzzword in several communities. Hacking conferences, cybersecurity groups, law enforcement agencies, journalists, and social engineering experts all use OSINT.

**Book Audience**

Digital Files:
Throughout this book, I refer to several files that can be downloaded to simplify the usage of various tools, techniques, and scripts. These are hosted on my website and available free to you. Download links are provided to simplify the learning process. Please embrace these files as a vital part of this book. They should minimize frustration and save time as you replicate the tutorials.

**Final Thoughts**

This book was written as a reference guide. It does not need to be read sequentially but was written as a chronological guide for most investigators. Skip around if needed or if you feel overwhelmed. The second chapter on Linux may seem too technical, so move on to the next chapter and return later. The book is suitable for all skill levels, and there is something here for everyone.

Many readers work in law enforcement or government agencies. Police officers can use these techniques to locate missing children or investigate human trafficking. Intelligence analysts can apply these methods to their daily work. Detectives can use these techniques to re-investigate unsolved cases. This book also caters to the private sector, especially security divisions of large corporations. It can help teams locate concise and appropriate information related to their companies. These methods have been proven successful for employees who monitor threats, from physical violence to counterfeit products. I encourage the use of these techniques to institutions responsible for finding and eliminating "bad apples," such as human resources departments, applicant processing employees, or "head hunters."

Parents and teachers are encouraged to use this book to locate social media content posted by children. In many households, children know more about the internet than adults and often hide content. This book can empower adults to identify important personal information that could pose a threat to children. Private investigators can use this book to find information without deep computer or internet knowledge. Several universities have adopted this book as required reading, and I am honored to play a small role in network security courses.

Let's get started.

**OSINT Preparation: Section I**

There is a lot to digest here. Allow yourself to skip over technical sections and return to them once you understand the overall intent. Many readers start with Section Two (Chapter Nine - Search Engines) or Chapter Eight to use the free custom search tools. Others read the entire book before touching a computer. Approach the content in a way that suits you best. Do not let the technical aspects deter you from finding areas that will benefit your investigations the most.

In the following chapters, I will explain how to ensure your computer host is secure, configure virtual machines for each investigation, embed Linux applications into Windows and Mac hosts, customize OSINT software, create your own set of search tools to automate queries, prepare a virtual Android environment for mobile investigations, and easily clone your work for immediate replication if anything becomes corrupt, damaged, or compromised. Your efforts now will pay off tenfold in the future.

I have also been guilty of neglecting computer security and proper browsing habits early in my career. While aware of malicious software, I relied on reinstalling Windows if something bad happened. This was reactive thinking. We must proactively address vulnerabilities in our privacy and security while conducting online research. This section is not a complete guide to computer security or a manual for total privacy. Instead, I hope to propose the most beneficial strategies to protect you from the majority of problems. Applying the changes mentioned in this section will provide a valuable layer of security to your online investigations and overall computing habits.

This entire section explains the essential steps I believe any online investigator should complete before conducting a search online. We should never jump into an investigation without being digitally secure, with a clean computer and software that has not been compromised from previous activity. We should begin each investigation with confidence, knowing we are working in an uncontaminated environment. It will take effort to create our perfect playground, but replicating a pristine environment for each investigation will be easy. Like a DNA forensics lab, your OSINT lab should face the same scrutiny.

The first four editions of this book began with search engine techniques. This edition will begin with essential preparation steps.
