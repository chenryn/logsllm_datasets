## Description
In the "Optimizing" section of the current documentation, a paragraph recommends using `librabbitmq`. However, issue #4693 indicates that `librabbitmq` is no longer the best-performing package.

## Suggestions
I suggest marking this paragraph as "outdated" or removing it entirely to prevent users from following it as a "best practice."
