### Migrating from Exchange 2003 to Exchange 2010 on a Domain Controller

I am the sole system administrator for a small company, and I am currently facing a challenging situation. The previous administrator installed Exchange 2003 on our Primary Domain Controller (PDC), which is running Windows Server 2003. I have been tasked with upgrading our Exchange server to Exchange 2010. 

I understand that Exchange cannot be directly upgraded; instead, it needs to be migrated to a new server. We are planning to purchase a new server for this purpose. However, I have been informed that this migration could cause significant issues, and it might be better to start a new domain with Exchange 2010 and then perform an Active Directory (AD) migration.

I would like to know if anyone else has faced a similar situation and if you have any advice on what to be aware of. This will be my first Exchange installation and migration, although I do have experience in Exchange administration.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

### Response and Guidance

**Swing Migration:**
The "swing migration" method is typically used when upgrading from one version of Windows Small Business Server (SBS) to another. Since you did not mention SBS, this method is not applicable in your situation.

**Domain Considerations:**
You do not need to create a new domain for this migration. In fact, it is generally advisable to avoid multi-domain or multi-forest Active Directory implementations unless absolutely necessary. If you have already started down this path, it would be best to revert and start over with a single-domain approach.

**Migration Steps:**

1. **Prepare the New Server:**
   - Join the new server, which will host Exchange 2010, to your existing Active Directory domain as a member server. It is not recommended to install Exchange on a domain controller.
   - If you decide to make the new server a domain controller, promote it now. Ideally, you should have at least two domain controllers for redundancy and stability.

2. **Update the Existing Exchange 2003 Server:**
   - Ensure that your existing Exchange 2003 server has Service Pack 2 (SP2) installed. If not, install it before proceeding.

3. **Install Exchange 2010:**
   - Install Exchange 2010 on the new server. If you need to move mailbox databases or transaction logs to specific disks, do so before starting the mailbox migration process.

4. **Migrate Mailboxes:**
   - Use mailbox move requests to migrate mailboxes from the Exchange 2003 server to the new Exchange 2010 server. This process is straightforward and does not require configuration changes on the user end.
   - Ensure that all users access their mailboxes at least once via Outlook after the migration.

5. **Retire the Old Exchange 2003 Server:**
   - After all mailboxes are moved and verified, you can begin the process of retiring the Exchange 2003 server. Follow Microsoft's guidelines for decommissioning Exchange 2003.

6. **Transition Email Flow:**
   - Configure the new Exchange 2010 server to handle internet email. This involves creating a "Send Connector" and an anonymous SMTP receive connector, and updating firewall rules to direct email traffic to the new server.

7. **Configure OWA and Autodiscover:**
   - Ensure that Outlook Web App (OWA) is available on the new Exchange 2010 server. This may require updating firewall rules.
   - Read up on the Exchange Autodiscover service, as it can impact SSL certificates and DNS infrastructure. You may want to review the following resources:
     - [Understanding the Autodiscover Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/architecture/client-access/autodiscover?view=exchserver-2019)
     - [White Paper: Exchange 2007 Autodiscover Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/office/exchange-server-2007/bb125081(v=exchg.80))

8. **Backup Management:**
   - Ensure that your backup management software supports Exchange 2010. If not, consider upgrading or changing your backup solution.

**Additional Resources:**
- Review Microsoft's documentation on upgrading and coexisting with Exchange 2010 for more detailed steps and best practices.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully migrate from Exchange 2003 to Exchange 2010 without the need for a new domain. Good luck with your migration!
