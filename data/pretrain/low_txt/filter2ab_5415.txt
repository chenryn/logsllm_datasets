**Title: Botconf 2016 - Nymaim: Origins, Revival, and Reversing Challenges**

In this presentation, we will delve into the resurgence of Nymaim, a notorious malware strain. Our focus will be on its evolution, particularly how it has expanded into the realm of banking fraud. We will also examine the sophisticated techniques employed by the malware's authors to complicate reverse engineering efforts. These include advanced code obfuscation methods designed to thwart dynamic analysis, signature-based detection, and Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) sinkholing.
