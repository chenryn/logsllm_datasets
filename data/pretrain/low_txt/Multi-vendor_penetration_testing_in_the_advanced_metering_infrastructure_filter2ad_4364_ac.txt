# AMI and Customer Systems: Results from the SGIG Program

## Key Result: Operations and Maintenance Cost Savings

Operations and maintenance (O&M) cost savings from remote billing and metering services are one of the most significant benefits for AMI business case analysis. From the summer of 2011 to the winter of 2014, SGIG utilities using AMI for remote meter reading and service orders avoided 13,785,708 meter operations truck rolls and 68,374,295 vehicle-miles traveled. This reduction in truck rolls saved an estimated 15,160 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from April 2011 to March 2015. On average, a utility saved about 1.3 vehicle-miles traveled every six months for each smart meter deployed.

Utilities like the Electric Power Board of Chattanooga (EPB) and NV Energy, which had full-scale AMI deployments, experienced significant O&M cost savings by converting manual processes to automated meter reading and remote service order fulfillment. NV Energy, with its highly transient customer base, saw substantial savings from reduced service connection and disconnection requests.

Larger smart meter deployments generally resulted in higher O&M cost savings from automation. Utilities with low customer densities and geographically dispersed service territories had greater savings potential compared to those in densely populated urban areas. Additionally, utilities that replaced electro-mechanical meters with AMI generally had higher incremental cost savings than those replacing automated meter reading (AMR) systems with AMI. The average per-meter O&M cost savings was $8.37 over a six-month period in 2014 for 19 SGIG projects, though actual savings varied significantly by project.

From 2011 to 2014, 19 projects reported cumulative O&M cost savings of more than $316 million, resulting in an average of $16.6 million savings per project over three years. However, the range of actual per-project savings was quite large; three projects realized the majority of the total savings, with one project alone saving more than $174 million. For example, CenterPoint Energy reported AMI cost savings of more than $61 million from 2012 to 2014, and Tri-State Electric Membership Corporation saw a 65% decrease in annual meter operations costs, from about $450,000 per year in 2011 to about $156,000 per year in 2013.

## Key Result: Improved Accuracy and Customer Services

AMI and related systems can dramatically reduce and quickly address customer complaints by providing customers and utility service representatives with accurate, timely, on-demand information about consumption and costs. AMI-enabled bill generation results in fewer customer complaints about inaccurate bills and enables utilities to resolve billing disputes faster. Several SGIG projects reported improvements in bill dispute resolution rates because customer service representatives could access real-time and historical energy use data to field customer questions.

AMI improves the accuracy of meter readings by automating activities previously done manually, minimizing human and other errors. With AMI, utilities no longer need to estimate or interpolate bills or offer bill adjustments due to meter reading errors or missed readings. For example, Oklahoma Gas and Electric reported significant improvements in billing accuracy and customer satisfaction.

Access to detailed consumption and cost information through in-home displays (IHDs) or web portals, available at any time, helped customers self-diagnose high electricity bills and develop strategies for better managing consumption and costs. Utility customer service representatives can retrieve billing details instantly and are better equipped to find causes and suggest energy efficiency solutions or alternative rate options.

AMI also enables utilities to proactively address customer billing issues. When appropriately programmed, customer information systems (CIS) can prompt customer service representatives to contact customers about unusual usage patterns before the bill is sent. Effective training of customer service personnel is crucial for using the enhanced information and implementing advanced billing and complaint-reducing features.

For instance, South Norwalk Electric and Water uses the service connect/disconnect switch to remotely verify that the meter for which a multi-dwelling building tenant is being billed is correct. Raft River Rural Electric Cooperative in Idaho now tracks irrigation accounts and automatically determines when they are operating and if bills need to be sent, reducing operating costs for truck rolls and labor.

Utilities with AMI can fulfill remote service connection and disconnection orders in hours instead of days. Central Maine Power, for example, can now fulfill reconnection service orders remotely in under 7 minutes.

## 2.2 Online Bill Payments and Pre-Pay Billing Plans

Online bill payment provides customer convenience while eliminating traditional paper payment processing costs, errors, and delays. Pre-pay billing programs reduce billing fluctuations, unanticipated high electric bills, and service disruptions for customers on pre-pay plans by communicating usage on regular intervals. Unpaid bill write-offs for utilities were also reduced. Seven utilities offered pre-payment plans, helping customers track their energy consumption and costs and reducing the amount of unpaid bills.

While online bill payment capabilities are common in the electric power industry, the implementation of web portals in connection with AMI deployments has enhanced customer insight. Greater customer use of this service reduces the costs of paper bills and lowers error rates from processing paper payment slips and checks. Online bill payments require the development of secure and user-friendly web portal interfaces for processing payment information. Although AMI is not necessary to implement online bill payments, it can help streamline the process and result in fewer data entry errors.

Many utilities have developed mobile phone applications for customers to access billing information, receive usage alerts, submit payments, and report outages. These applications are particularly useful during power outages, as mobile phone networks generally remain in service, allowing for timely reporting without overburdening customer service representatives.

## Key Result: Enhanced Revenues and Reduced Bad Debt Write-Offs

Several utilities improved revenue collection and cost recovery by implementing pre-pay billing programs that help customers avoid defaulting on their bills. Pre-pay billing plans contributed to a reduction in bad debt write-offs and allowed participating customers to budget their electricity use. Reducing debt write-offs improves revenue collection, strengthens cost recovery, and enhances the financial health of the utility, ultimately benefiting customers through better-managed operating costs.

Talquin Electric Cooperative decreased its bad debt write-offs by about 65% since 2011, partly due to its pre-pay program. Tri-State Electric Membership Corporation's bad debt decreased from almost $46,000 in 2011 to about $21,000 in 2013, with effective bad debt falling by 97% from $44,000 to just over $1,000 between 2011 and 2013.

Pre-pay billing plans provide convenient services for customers needing assistance in managing consumption and costs. For customers, pre-pay plans reduce or eliminate service deposits, late fees, and reconnect fees, and help track consumption and costs using web portals and automated alerts by email, text message, and phone call. Pre-pay plans also offer seasonal or temporary customers an improved ability to obtain and manage electricity services.

## 2.3 Meter Tampering and Theft Detection

Historically, meter readers or headquarters personnel detected electricity theft by identifying abnormal changes in electricity usage over long periods. Customers often go to great lengths to steal electricity, risking injury or even death. According to Forbes, electricity thefts amount to about $6 billion annually, making it the third most stolen item after credit card data and automobiles.

SGIG funding recipients used AMI to program meter data management systems (MDMS) to detect instances of meter tampering, which indicated potential cases of electricity theft. Many utilities have systems that issue alarms or notifications when irregularities in consumption activity are identified. The SGIG utilities found that many tamper incidents were not always due to actual theft but sometimes to faulty meters.

New capabilities for tamper and theft detection through AMI deployments enhance revenue and cost recovery. Utilities can improve revenue collection and cost recovery from enhanced theft detection, identification of faulty meters, and registering previously unregistered (and therefore non-paying) meters. Additional benefits include labor hour savings, fewer truck rolls, and reduced time to find violators.

On average, utilities confirmed 951 tamper detections, with six utilities reporting more than 1,000 incidents and two utilities confirming more than 5,000 incidents (out of 29 projects reporting). One utility identified 600 improperly configured meters. CenterPoint Energy boosted revenue collections by more than $4.5 million from 2012 to 2014 from the identification of slow meters, unregistered meters, and electricity theft.

Tamper detection also created new technical challenges for several utilities, who faced increased tamper detection costs when false alarms required field investigations. Several utilities are now working to develop better data analytics to differentiate actual theft incidents from events that can trigger tamper alarms, reducing the number of false positives and unnecessary truck rolls.

## 2.4 Outage Detection and Management

AMI became an essential aspect of service restoration activities and outage management system (OMS) operations for many SGIG projects. Smart meter data enabled these utilities to reduce the costs and boost the effectiveness of outage management operations. Smart meters with outage detection and notification automatically transmit a "last gasp" notification when power to the meter is lost. This feature enables grid operators to identify outage locations and dispatch repair crews to precise locations where they are needed. The alert includes the meter number and a timestamp, indicating the location of the meter and the time of the outage. Smart meters can also transmit "power on" notifications to the head-end systems or OMS when power is restored.

AMI enables different but complementary outage management functions from those enabled by distribution automation (DA) technologies. AMI monitors outages at the customer meter to help utilities assess and characterize outage events, whereas DA technologies monitor outages at feeders and substations and, in some cases, help automate power restoration on feeders and substations. AMI and DA outage management functions combine effectively, particularly when AMI is integrated with distribution management systems (DMS).

AMI enables utilities to identify outages more quickly and dispatch repair crews more precisely, thus reducing the duration of outages and producing lower outage costs and fewer inconveniences for customers. Remote meter queries shorten service restoration times by identifying "nested" outages—electrical problems masked by larger outages. In these situations, which generally follow severe weather events, repair crews fix obvious problems and believe power has been restored to an entire area. Before AMI, repair crews would leave, unaware of the secondary electrical problem until affected customers called to complain. Remote meter query can avoid the restoration delays associated with nested outage identification.

AMI reduces labor hours and truck rolls associated with outage diagnosis and restoration. In the past, customers called a hotline to notify the utility of an outage. Once the repair was made, the utility assumed all customers on the feeder had their power restored. In large-scale outages, this assumption was often incorrect, leading to further customer calls and complaints. Because meter status can be checked without a truck roll, one utility avoided more than 300 "okay-on-arrival" truck rolls during one storm alone.

Utilities facing regular, severe weather events and storm-induced outages have greater incentives for using AMI for outage management. Several SGIG projects implemented major recovery operations following Hurricane Irene in 2011 and Superstorm Sandy in 2012. SGIG projects in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern states reported using AMI to support restoration efforts following these devastating storms.

Not all utilities are in a position to integrate AMI with OMS, DMS, SCADA, GIS, and other distribution operations systems. While last-gasp alerts and meter pinging capabilities are available for all smart meter deployments, there are systems integration issues to tackle in making full use of them.

Once AMI data has been processed and integrated with CIS, OMS, and GIS, utility personnel have access to more accurate and timely data about outages and service restoration activities. New software tools and mapping capabilities boost overall situational awareness when outages occur, enabling utility officials to provide customers, first responders, local officials, and the news media with better information to improve customer satisfaction levels and coordination with government agencies and the public.

Some utilities used GIS with smart meter data to create detailed outage maps, and in some cases, posted these maps on utility websites to keep the public and local media informed of service restoration progress. Meter pinging enables operators to track progress and inform repair crews of customers still without power. All of these efforts measurably improved outage restoration processes and procedures, lowered costs, accelerated repairs, shortened outage durations, and reduced customer outage costs and inconveniences.

## 2.5 Voltage Monitoring

Utilities can use AMI voltage monitoring capabilities to enhance the effectiveness of automated controls for voltage and reactive power management, particularly for conservation voltage reduction (CVR) programs. Voltage monitoring is the smart meter capability to measure voltage levels and certain power quality parameters, which utilities can use to develop accurate voltage profiles across feeder lines throughout the system. For example, smart meters can measure current transients and harmonics, a feature most often activated for industrial customers who operate sensitive machinery, motors, and rotating equipment. Data on voltages can be used to diagnose customer voltage issues remotely and determine if the issue is related to the distribution system or factors occurring inside customer premises. Voltage data is processed by the DMS and can be used by grid operators to develop distribution system models and optimize voltages across the grid.

With smart meter voltage monitoring, grid operators can assess voltage conditions and ensure CVR operations maintain voltage levels within acceptable limits. Several SGIG projects successfully did this. Benefits from these practices include reduced line losses and peak demands, improvements in power factors, and energy savings. Voltage monitoring and controls provide utilities with another resource option for managing grid operations, controlling costs, and maintaining adequate supply-demand balances.

SGIG utilities testing voltage monitoring and reactive power management applications often used AMI capabilities in conjunction with DA technologies and systems. Project results specific to those DA technologies are reported separately and in greater detail in Distribution Automation: Results from the SGIG Program.

Voltage monitoring provides another useful benefit stream to include in business case analysis of AMI investments. Since it is used in conjunction with other smart grid technologies and systems, such as line sensors, voltage regulators, and automated capacitor banks, it can be difficult to estimate the incremental value of AMI in evaluating investments in automated controls for voltages and reactive power management. Utilities are developing tools for data analytics to support such analysis, which would not be possible without voltage data from AMI deployments on affected substations and feeders.

Voltage monitoring capabilities are available on smart meter deployments, but not all utilities are currently using them. Prior to the SGIG program, the business case for CVR using smart meters was not clear. Continued demonstration of CVR benefits by leading utilities and growing market adoption of distributed energy resources (DER) is likely to drive utility interest in investments in voltage monitoring and control technologies and systems. Even if not used at the outset of AMI deployments, utilities can enable this capability when they are ready to move forward with automated controls for voltage and reactive power management.
