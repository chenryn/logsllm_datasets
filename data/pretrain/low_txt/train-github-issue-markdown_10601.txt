The following characters are not functioning correctly with the Hungarian keyboard layout:

- `\` (backslash): Accessed via Alt Gr + q
- `[` (left square bracket): Accessed via Alt Gr + f
- `â‚¬` (euro symbol): Accessed via Alt Gr + u. This key also triggers the synchronization of settings using the "sync-settings" plugin.

Two out of these three keys (`\` and `[`) are essential for code editing.
