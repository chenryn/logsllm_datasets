This issue causes the initialization of a new React Native project template to fail when running `yarn tsc --noEmit -p .`, as documented in this issue: [react-native-community/react-native-template-typescript#203](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-template-typescript/issues/203).

Currently, the recommended solution is to patch one of the two type libraries by removing the `AbortSignal` and `AbortController` definitions.
