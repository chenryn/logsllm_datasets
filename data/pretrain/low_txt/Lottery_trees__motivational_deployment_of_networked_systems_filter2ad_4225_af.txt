### Table 2: Sensitivity Analysis—Competitive Ratios

| Model/Parameter          | Range                | Competitive Ratio |
|--------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Toivonen: CInit          | 0.977                | -                 |
| Toivonen: CRange         | 0.228                | -                 |
| Contribution Models       | 0.702                | -                 |
| Prospect Theory α        | 0.0 – 1.0            | 0.939             |
| Prospect Theory γ        | 103 – 106            | 0.967             |
| Independent Cascade p    | 0 – 5 minutes        | 0.972             |
| Diminishing Cascade p    | 10 – 150 minutes     | 0.976             |
| Diminishing Cascade q, p = 0.1 | 1 – 10           | 0.82              |
| Diminishing Cascade q, p = 0.2 | Uniform Random   | 0.886             |
| Diffusion Model          | Uniform Constant     | 0.958             |
| LifeJournal [6]          | 0.05 – 1             | 0.993             |

The table shows the worst competitive ratio achieved by our choices of β and δ across the simulated range. With one exception, our choice of β and δ achieves a competitive ratio of at least 0.7 for all parameter sweeps. The exception is STC, as shown in Figure 4 (right); the competitive ratio of our parameters starts dropping significantly as STC increases. In all other cases, our choices were robust to changes in model settings.

Interestingly, this holds even as we substituted entire model blocks (social network model, diffusion model, etc.) with other models. For instance, our choices of β and δ achieve a competitive ratio of more than 0.9 when replacing the availability-based contribution model [15] with a uniform contribution model, or when replacing the independent cascade diffusion model with a model based on real diffusion data reported for the LiveJournal community in [6].

### 8. Legal Issues

This section applies only to laws of the United States; laws in other countries may differ considerably. There are three classes of law that have technical bearing on the lottree mechanism as presented in this paper: promotion law, tax law, and the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003.

**Promotion Law:**
Two aspects of promotion law impact lottree deployment:
1. **Consideration:** Depending on the effort required, the installation and running of a distributed-system component may be judged to be "consideration," meaning it is legally regarded as a transfer of tangible value from the participant to the executive. If so, the executive is obligated to provide an alternate means of entry (AMOE) by which a person can become eligible for the payout without participating in the system. This is the reason behind the "no purchase necessary" disclaimers that typically accompany commercial sweepstakes. The potential impact on a lottree deployment is that some small fraction of "participants" may not actually be contributing to the system.
2. **Variable Prize Pools:** Promotion law generally disallows variable prize pools, which precludes the use of the rescaling technique described in Section 5.3.

**Tax Law:**
The main issue involving tax law is that any payment in excess of the 1099 threshold requires the filing of a 1099-MISC tax form. This threshold is set for each tax year and is $600 for tax year 2007. The impact on lottree deployment is that a payment in excess of $600 may be more burdensome for both the system executive and the lottree winner.

**CAN-SPAM Act of 2003:**
This act was designed to legally inhibit companies from sending unwanted commercial email. It also restricts the degree to which a company can encourage others to send commercial email on the company's behalf. This law impacts lottree deployments in two ways:
1. **Solicitation Modes:** The lottree must not encourage email solicitations in preference to other modes of solicitation.
2. **Solicitation Limits:** The lottree should limit the number of solicitations each participant can issue per day; in our simulations, we limited this number to three.

We believe that the Pachira scheme, which we plan to employ to spur deployment of our own networked system, complies with all the above laws.

### 9. Related Work

There exists a vast literature on incentive mechanisms and techniques in the networking literature. However, most prior schemes are relevant only to symmetric systems in which every node has a rational interest in participating or contributing. As pointed out in the introduction, such mechanisms are unsuited for motivational deployment to bootstrap asymmetric systems or symmetric systems that require a sufficiently large network effect to become self-sustained. Much of this work, for instance, is tailored to specific peer-to-peer applications, including file sharing [32], routing [8], content distribution [31], and multicast [27].

There has also been research into application-generic symmetric incentives such as bartering [11], economic systems [36], tit-for-tat [23] as in BitTorrent, or robustness in BAR models [22]. In the context of asymmetric systems, CompuP2P [18] is a peer-to-peer system that constructs decentralized markets for buying and selling computing resources. CompuP2P assumes the availability of an electronic payment mechanism to scalably and securely transfer funds from the system’s beneficiaries to its contributors, in exchange for use of the contributors’ resources. Kamvar et al. [19] consider a pay-per-transaction file-sharing system, wherein peers are in competition for the opportunity to profit by providing requested file content. They show that such competition can lead to non-cooperation, similar to a lottree without the WSI property.

### 10. Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper, we addressed the question of how to motivate people to join or contribute to a networked system that does not (or not yet) offer them inherent participation benefits. In answer, we proposed a lottery tree, a mechanism that probabilistically rewards each participant in a manner dependent on their contribution and the contributions of others whose participation they have solicited. Lottrees are most effective at spurring deployment when systems are small or medium-sized, which are the scales at which motivational deployment is most challenging. As the system scale increases, the lottree's effectiveness begins to wane, just as the self-sustaining aspects of the networked system can be expected to become active.

We formally defined seven desirable properties for lottrees and constructed the Pachira lottree scheme, which simultaneously satisfies a maximal satisfiable subset of these properties. We further showed relatively straightforward workarounds for the two properties that Pachira does not satisfy.

We then conducted extensive simulations, with which we derived good choices for the Pachira lottree's parameters, determined an appropriate payout amount based on target deployment scale and expected participation effort, and determined the required count of initial participants to preclude stunted deployment. We also performed a wide range of simulation experiments to analyze the sensitivity of our evaluation to our modeling assumptions and hidden parameters.

We conclude that Pachira is a practically ideal candidate for deploying real networked systems, and we plan to employ this scheme as part of an ongoing distributed-systems project requiring contributions of CPU and bandwidth from a large number of PC users.

A looming open problem is auditing. The lottree mechanism is inherently based on the assumption that each participant's contribution can be reliably and securely measured and reported to the executive entity. Depending on the properties of the system in question, this may be anywhere from thoroughly straightforward to exceedingly challenging.

It may be interesting to consider generalized versions of lottree systems, such as those not constrained to a tree structure. This could be relevant, for example, in cases in which a potential participant is concurrently solicited by more than one active member of the system.
