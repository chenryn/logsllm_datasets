### Contradiction to the CDH Assumption

The adversary \( F \) queries the oracle \( H \) with the values \( Z_3^* = uV = vU \). From these values, \( F \) can directly output \( \text{CDH}(U, V) = Z_3^* \). This contradicts the Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption.

The success probability of \( F \) in this case is given by:
\[
\Pr[F] \geq \frac{2}{s(k)^2 t(k)} p_4(k)
\]
where \( p_4(k) \) is the probability that CASE 1.2.2 occurs and the adversary \( M \) succeeds in this case. Here, \( t(k) \) is a polynomial bound on the number of distinct \( H \) calls made by the adversary \( M \).

For CASE 1.2.3 and CASE 1.2.4, the simulation of \( A \) and \( B \) is similar to that of CASE 1.1.1. The details are omitted.

Combining equations (3), (4), and (5), the success probability of \( S \) is:
\[
\Pr[S] \geq \max_{i=1,2,3,5,6} \left\{ \frac{s(k) n(k)^2 t(k) p_i(k)}{1} \right\}
\]
where \( p_5(k) \) and \( p_6(k) \) are defined in CASE 1.2.3 and CASE 1.2.4, respectively.

The success probability of \( F \) is:
\[
\Pr[F] \geq \frac{2}{s(k)^2 t(k)} p_4(k)
\]
where \( p_4(k) \) is defined in (6).

If the adversary \( M \) succeeds with non-negligible probability in any of the above cases, we can also solve the Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (BDH) or CDH problem with non-negligible probability, which contradicts the assumed security of the BDH and CDH problems. Additionally, note that the BDH problem can be reduced to the CDH problem. Therefore, we can conclude that our scheme's security is based on the BDH problem.

### Protocol Comparison

Table 1 shows the comparison between ID-based two-party Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) protocols in terms of efficiency, security model, and underlying hardness assumptions. We do not consider subgroup validation and offline computation that may be applicable.

We use the following symbols to explain the computational performance of each scheme. For simplicity, we only consider expensive operations:

- **P**: Pairing.
- **E**: Exponentiation in \( G \).
- **T**: Exponentiation in \( G_T \).
- **Enc**: Encryption algorithm of KEM.
- **Dec**: Decryption algorithm of KEM.

- **ECK**: Enhanced Chen-Kudla protocol [8].
- **EMB**: Enhanced McCullagh-Barreto protocol [8].
- **MBDH**: Modified bilinear Diffie-Hellman, on which protocol 2 of paper [12] is based.
- **(ℓ)-BCAA1**: Bilinear collision attack assumption, on which EMB scheme is based.

As stated in the introduction, both protocol 1 and protocol 2 from [12] do not support the adversary's EphemeralKeyReveal queries to those sessions owned by the peer of the Test session. Therefore, both protocols do not achieve the requirements of the CK model (which allows adversaries to make EphemeralKeyReveal queries to all sessions except for the Test session and its matching session). We denote their security model as CK*. The Bellare-Rogaway (BR) model [2] does not allow EphemeralKeyReveal queries at all. Note that neither the BR nor CK* models cover KGC forward security (KGC-fs), while our eCK model does. KCI denotes security against key-compromise impersonation, and KGC-fs denotes KGC forward security.

As shown in Table 1, compared with CK and Smart schemes, our scheme has advantages in both the hardness assumption and the security model. While SCK-1 and SYL schemes base security on the BDH assumption, the eCK model of our scheme is stronger than their BR model, which does not support EphemeralKeyReveal queries at all.

Compared with ECK and EMB, our scheme has advantages in both efficiency and the security model. Compared with Wang05, the assumption of our scheme is more standard, and the model is stronger. Compared with CC071 and CC072, our eCK model better supports EphemeralKeyReveal queries than their CK* model, which is even weaker than the CK model.

Finally, the comparison between Boyd et al.'s protocol and ours is somewhat complex. Since their protocol is generic, it can be instantiated using any combination of KEM as long as they are CCA secure. If the underlying KEM is instantiated using any KEM scheme in the standard model, our protocol in the random oracle model is more efficient. On the other hand, if the underlying KEM is instantiated using any KEM scheme in the random oracle, such as the Boneh-Franklin encryption scheme [4], which is CCA-secure under the BDH assumption, the operations required are \( 1\text{Enc} + 1\text{Dec} + 2\text{E} \) (which totals to \( 2\text{P} + 5\text{E} \)), while our scheme requires \( 2\text{P} + 3\text{E} \).

### Conclusions

Designing and proving the security of ID-based authenticated key exchange protocols is known to be challenging. The main issue is that without the corresponding static private key, it is difficult for the simulator to handle SessionKeyReveal and EphemeralKeyReveal queries. One common approach is to rely on the Gap Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (GBDH) assumption to maintain the consistency of random oracle queries.

In this paper, we present a new provably secure ID-based AKE protocol based on the trapdoor test technique. Our protocol's security relies on the BDH assumption rather than the GBDH assumption. Moreover, our scheme is proven secure in the eCK model, which better supports SessionKeyReveal and EphemeralKeyReveal queries. To the best of our knowledge, our scheme is the first ID-based AKE protocol provably secure in the eCK model.

Compared to previous ID-based AKE protocols based on the gap assumption, our proposal has a more standard assumption, i.e., the BDH assumption. On the other hand, compared to other ID-based AKE protocols without the gap assumption, our proposal has advantages in either efficiency or the security model.
