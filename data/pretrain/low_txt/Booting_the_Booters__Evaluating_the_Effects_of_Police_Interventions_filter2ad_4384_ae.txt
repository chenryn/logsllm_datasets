### Ethical Considerations

The ethical justification for the UDP reflection honeypots operated by the Cambridge Cybercrime Centre is described in Thomas et al. [61] and summarized below.

Reflecting UDP packets could assist criminals in performing DoS attacks. However, the hopscotch reflector limits the number of packets it reflects to any IP address. It attempts to only reflect to the criminals' scanners (so that they use the honeypots) but not (at any scale) to victims. Furthermore, when any hopscotch sensor identifies a victim, this is reported to a central server which informs all other sensors of the attack, so that they all refuse to reflect any packets at all to the victim.

The result is that if the hopscotch sensors are used for illegal attacks, then after a very short period, there will be less traffic delivered to the victim than if the sensors did not exist. This is because some of the attack traffic generated by the criminal is absorbed by the sensors rather than going to real reflectors and being reflected and amplified.

‘White-hat’ scanners identify reflectors and report them to the relevant ISP or hosting company, who will then contact the owner of the machine. The hopscotch sensors do not reply to identified ‘white-hat’ scanners or known researchers to avoid wasting their time or affecting their results.

Data on self-reported attacks by booters was collected by logging into the booter websites as a visitor. No data was collected that required buying a subscription or requesting an attack before data would be displayed.

Both datasets can be obtained by academic researchers from the Cambridge Cybercrime Centre to fully reproduce or build upon our results. For more information, visit https://www.cambridgecybercrime.uk/process.html.

In line with previous research in this space, we have not published the identity of any booters that are still operational at the time of publication.

The ethical issues in the use of leaked or seized booter databases to support our results are discussed by Thomas et al. [61] and put in a broader context in a later paper on the use of leaked data for research [62]. Only the attack logs were analyzed for this paper.

We followed our institution's ethical review procedure throughout. We carefully designed our experiments to operate ethically and had no human subjects. Our related qualitative research, which supported this work, was approved by our ethics committee (#621).
