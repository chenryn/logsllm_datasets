### Version Information
- **Local Environment:** 2.6.7
- **JSFiddle Environment:** Not sure

### Reproduction Link
- [JSFiddle Example](https://jsfiddle.net/cicsolutions/qkzjp520/6/)

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Create three named slots:
   - (1) A slot with no dash in the name, e.g., `header` or `footer`, as shown in the documentation.
   - (2) A slot with a dash in the name, e.g., `card-header`.
   - (3) A slot with a camelCased name, e.g., `cardHeader`.

2. Log the slot contents at the `created` and `mounted` lifecycle hooks of the component (other lifecycle hooks were not tested).

### Expected Behavior
- I expect the slot contents for all slot naming conventions (no dash, dash, and camelCase) to be available in the lifecycle hooks and to render correctly in the component.
- If the slot contents can be logged to the console during the `created` or `mounted` hooks, I expect them to be rendered via the `render` function.

### Actual Behavior
- The slot content for a slot with a dash in the name (e.g., `card-header`) is `undefined` at the `created` hook, while the slot content for a slot without a dash (e.g., `header` or `footer`) is defined as expected with the slot node object.
- The slot content for a slot with a camelCased name (e.g., `cardHeader`) is logged to the console properly but is not rendered in the component.

### Additional Notes
- I am still learning Vue and do not have the time to search through forums and documentation extensively. Please let me know if this report is unhelpful.
- The documentation does not provide clear guidance on the syntax for compound slot names. However, I recall reading that camelCase is not valid HTML, so I initially assumed that hyphenated names would be correct.
- It makes sense that the value following the colon in the directive declaration becomes the key in the `$slots` object, and it is not rendered as a DOM element attribute. This led me to think that camelCase might be the proper way to handle compound slot names. However, when using camelCase, the slot content appears in the console but is not rendered via the `render` function.
- It would be helpful if the documentation could clarify the proper naming convention for slot names, especially for compound names, as they seem to be a common approach.
- I did not test other lifecycle hooks.
- It seems inconsistent that a slot with a dash in the name renders correctly but shows as `undefined` in the `created` and `mounted` hooks, while a camelCase slot name shows the correct node value in the hooks but does not render the slotted content.

### Conclusion
I hope this information is helpful. Thank you for your work on Vue; it is the best framework I have ever used!
