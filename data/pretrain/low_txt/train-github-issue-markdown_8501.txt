Hello everyone,

I am experiencing an issue with the Chrome extension, React Developer Tools. When I update a component's state, the changes are not reflected in the DevTools window. Instead, I only see arrows with the title "Reset value" (as shown in the screenshot below).

Does anyone know how to resolve this issue?

Thank you very much for your help!
