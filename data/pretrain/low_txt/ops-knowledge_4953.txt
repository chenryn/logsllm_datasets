The provided log entries span from August 24, 2015, 15:36 to 18:51. The logs are generated by two primary components: `FastLeaderElection` and `QuorumCnxManager`.

### Summary of Log Entries:

1. **FastLeaderElection Notifications:**
   - The `FastLeaderElection` component is logging an "INFO" level message indicating a notification timeout every 60,000 milliseconds (or 60 seconds). This occurs at the following times:
     - 15:36:13
     - 15:51:13
     - 16:02:13
     - 16:11:13
     - 18:02:14
     - 18:04:14
     - 18:41:14
     - 18:47:14

2. **QuorumCnxManager Warnings:**
   - The `QuorumCnxManager` component is logging "WARN" level messages indicating that it cannot open a channel to specific election addresses. These warnings occur at the following times:
     - 15:37:13: Cannot open channel to 2 at /10.10.34.12:3888
     - 15:55:13: Cannot open channel to 2 at /10.10.34.12:3888
     - 15:57:13: Cannot open channel to 2 at /10.10.34.12:3888
     - 16:03:13: Cannot open channel to 2 at /10.10.34.12:3888
     - 16:12:13: Cannot open channel to 3 at /10.10.34.13:3888
     - 16:37:13: Cannot open channel to 2 at /10.10.34.12:3888
     - 16:51:13: Cannot open channel to 3 at /10.10.34.13:3888
     - 17:29:13: Cannot open channel to 3 at /10.10.34.13:3888
     - 17:39:14: Cannot open channel to 2 at /10.10.34.12:3888
     - 18:28:14: Cannot open channel to 2 at /10.10.34.12:3888
     - 18:31:14: Cannot open channel to 3 at /10.10.34.13:3888
     - 18:51:14: Cannot open channel to 2 at /10.10.34.12:3888

### Key Observations:
- The `FastLeaderElection` component consistently logs a notification timeout every 60 seconds.
- The `QuorumCnxManager` component frequently encounters issues in opening channels to two specific IP addresses (`/10.10.34.12:3888` and `/10.10.34.13:3888`). The warnings for these issues are intermittent but frequent.

### Conclusion:
The system is experiencing regular timeouts in the `FastLeaderElection` component and recurring connection issues in the `QuorumCnxManager` component. These issues may indicate network connectivity problems or configuration issues with the specified election addresses. Further investigation into the network and configuration settings is recommended to resolve these issues.
