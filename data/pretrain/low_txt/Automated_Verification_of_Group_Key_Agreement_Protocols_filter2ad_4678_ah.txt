### Table I: Overview of Case Studies
For additional details, please refer to [13]. The key lemmas used in the proofs are as follows:

1. **Ephemeral Secret Keys Creation**: All factors of an exponent that are ephemeral secret keys have been created by a participant in an earlier round.
2. **Unique Round Keys**: For no round is the round key sent the same as one of the keys sent for another participant.
3. **Secrecy of Received Exponents**: All factors of all received exponents are secret.

#### Explanation of Lemma 1
Lemma 1, depicted in Figure 17, states that for all ephemeral secret keys (esk) from round \( r_1 \) that also appear as a factor of an exponent in round \( r_2 \), it holds that \( r_1 < r_2 \). TAMARIN proves this using induction. It first proves an auxiliary lemma that all factors are ephemeral secret keys and then shows that each of them has been created in an earlier round.

### E. Experimental Results
Table I provides an overview of our case studies, which are available at [13]. We discussed the models for the group protocols in detail in the previous section. 

- **STR Protocol**: We verified two versions of the STR protocol: one using authentic channels and another using insecure channels with signatures, where the adversary can reveal signing keys.
- **Group Joux and GDH Protocols**: For Group Joux and GDH, we considered the case of authentic channels. TAMARIN performs the proof fully automatically for the two STR versions and Group Joux without requiring any intermediate lemmas. For GDH, we provided intermediate lemmas that TAMARIN can prove automatically.

#### Analysis of Tripartite Protocols
We also analyzed two tripartite protocols:
- **Signed Joux Protocol**: TAMARIN verifies that it satisfies perfect forward secrecy (PFS). If the adversary is allowed to learn ephemeral secret keys, TAMARIN finds an attack.
- **TAK1 Protocol**: TAMARIN finds an attack against the eCK-security property, which uses ephemeral key reveals combined with long-term key reveals. TAMARIN proves a weakened security property, disallowing the adversary from revealing both an ephemeral key and a long-term key.

#### Identity-Based Protocols with Bilinear Pairings
Finally, we analyzed three identity-based protocols that use bilinear pairings:
- **RYY Protocol [22]**: TAMARIN shows that the RYY protocol provides weak perfect forward secrecy (wPFS) but is vulnerable to ephemeral key reveal attacks.
- **Scott Protocol [23]**: Similar results were obtained for the Scott protocol.
- **Chen-Kudla Protocol [24]**: This protocol uses point addition, which we do not support in our model. We approximate point addition with an associative and commutative operator. TAMARIN verifies that the protocol is secure in an eCK-like model, allowing the revelation of ephemeral keys of some, but not all, agents involved in a session. Removing this restriction leads to an attack being found.

### VI. Related Work
Other applications of symbolic methods to find attacks on group key agreement protocols include:
- **CORAL Tool [6]**: Used to automatically find six attacks on three different protocols. CORAL can only perform falsification but not verification and does not support Difﬁe-Hellman or bilinear pairings.
- **NPA Tool [25]**: Used by Meadows et al. for the formal analysis of an abstract version of the GDOI protocol, a key transport protocol with a trusted central key server.
- **Maude-NPA [26]**: An automated tool based on rewriting logic, capable of analyzing secrecy properties of DH protocols. It does not support bilinear pairing, but our theory could be used to extend it.
- **Pankova et al. [27]**: Provide a transformation from a Horn theory modulo bilinear pairing to a Horn theory that can be analyzed with ProVerif. Our approach handles AC operators, does not require the exponent-ground property, and supports advanced security properties.
- **ProVerifList [7]**: Uses a modified version of the basic ProVerif algorithm to verify protocols with unbounded lists but supports only a strict subset of ProVerif’s features.
- **Kremer and Mazaré [29]**: Propose a manual symbolic analysis method for secrecy with respect to a passive adversary, extending Bellare-Rogaway’s soundness results to bilinear pairing. Our approach deals with active adversaries and a large class of security properties.

### VII. Conclusions
We have presented the first algorithm for the symbolic falsification and verification of group key agreement protocols using Difﬁe-Hellman exponentiation, bilinear pairing, and AC-operators, by extending the algorithm underlying TAMARIN. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

Our extensions, such as AC-operators and bilinear pairing, are of independent interest. For example, AC-operators can model lists, maps, and multisets, while bilinear pairings are used in various types of protocols, including identity-based ones.

Future work includes analyzing other variants of protocols with subgroup keys, such as tree group Difﬁe-Hellman (TGDH) [30], further advanced security properties, and dynamic group operations like join and leave. TAMARIN's scope may also facilitate the analysis of systems that use group protocols as components, such as the SafeSlinger [31] protocol.

Our current equational theory does not support point addition and group element multiplication, a restriction shared with other automated approaches. We aim to investigate support for such protocols, such as HMQV or Burmester-Desmedt [32].
