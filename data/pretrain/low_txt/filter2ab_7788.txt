**Title: BlackHat US-21: "I'm a Hacker, Get Me Out of Here!": Breaking Network Segregation Using Esoteric Command & Control Channels**

**Abstract:**

This presentation will delve into the weaponization of esoteric internal command and control (C2) channels and their application for lateral movement within heavily segregated network environments. James, an attack simulation consultant at F-Secure Consulting, will showcase innovative and reimagined techniques to breach such environments. The session will cover the following C2 methods, along with the tools James has developed to operationalize these techniques:

- **C2 through vCenter and Guest Additions:** Leveraging virtual machine management interfaces.
- **C2 via Arbitrary Network Printers and Print Jobs:** Utilizing print services for covert communication.
- **C2 over Remote Desktop Mapped Drives and File Shares:** Exploiting file sharing mechanisms.
- **C2 using LDAP Attributes:** Manipulating directory service attributes for C2.

For red team professionals, James will provide insights into identifying and exploiting these channels, along with the operational security (OpSec) considerations for each technique. He will also share the tools he has developed to integrate with popular C2 frameworks like Cobalt Strike and C3, ensuring a seamless and efficient C2 experience.

For blue team defenders, James will discuss the detection artifacts generated by these tools and present use cases for implementing effective monitoring and defense strategies. He will challenge common assumptions about how sophisticated threat actors operate within segregated environments and highlight how traditionally trusted boundary systems and technologies can be subverted to facilitate unauthorized access to sensitive network zones.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Novel and reimagined C2 techniques for breaking out of segregated environments.
- Tools and methodologies for integrating these techniques with existing C2 frameworks.
- Detection strategies and use cases for blue team defenders.
- A deeper understanding of the potential vulnerabilities in commonly accepted boundary systems.

Join us to gain valuable insights into both offensive and defensive aspects of network segregation and C2 operations.
