### Table 5: Run-time in Seconds and Communication in MB for Steps 1–4 of Our Circuit PSI and qPSI Protocols

| Set Size | Step 1 (s) | Step 2 (s) | Step 3 (s) | Step 4 (s) | Total Time (s) | Communication (MB) |
|----------|------------|------------|------------|------------|----------------|--------------------|
| 1038.68  | 74.19      | 218        | 13.12      | 108.36     | 4086.45        | 291.89             |

As the set size increases, the non-linear compute starts to become a bottleneck, and our protocol loses performance compared to Protocol C. Note that Protocol C benefits from much lighter computation and linear communication complexity. Since Protocol B requires more communication, it is less efficient than the other two protocols in a WAN setting.

### 6.2.1 Cost Estimation of HE-based mPSI

[44] presented mPSI schemes based on threshold additively homomorphic encryption (AHE) and we estimate the cost of their most efficient variant, which uses hashing to significantly reduce the computation cost. The protocol consists of four main steps:

1. **Distributed Key Generation Phase**: For an AHE scheme.
2. **Encryption Phase**: Each client (parties \( P_2, \ldots, P_n \)) generates \( B\zeta \) ciphertexts using the AHE encryption and sends them to the leader \( P_1 \). Here, \( B = \frac{m}{\log m} \) is the number of bins after hashing, and each bin contains \( \zeta = \frac{m}{B} + \sqrt{\frac{m \log B}{B}} \) values.
3. **Homomorphic Evaluation Phase**: The leader \( P_1 \) performs \( B\zeta n + \zeta m \) homomorphic additions and \( m\zeta \) homomorphic scalar multiplications (for plaintext size of 32 bits).
4. **Threshold Decryption Phase**: All parties jointly decrypt \( m \) ciphertexts.

Since the end-to-end protocol requires concretely efficient protocols for distributed key generation (Step 1), we focus only on AHE schemes for which such concretely efficient protocols are known (and thus do not consider lattice-based AHE schemes [8, 33, 34]). As suggested by [44], we use El Gamal and Paillier-based AHE schemes and estimate the cost of Steps 2 and 3, which provides a strict lower bound for the overall cost.

Using the microbenchmarking costs provided in [29] for both El Gamal and Paillier encryption schemes, we find:
- For \( m = 2^{20} \) and \( n = 15 \), the computation cost lower bound is 729 seconds for the El Gamal instantiation and 7973 seconds for the Paillier instantiation in a similar setting as ours. In contrast, our end-to-end protocol takes approximately 40 seconds, making it at least 18 times and 200 times faster than the El Gamal and Paillier-based schemes, respectively. The communication estimate for these steps is similar to ours in the case of El Gamal but much higher for the Paillier-based scheme.
- For \( m = 2^{12} \) and \( n = 5 \), these two steps take at least 4 seconds with El Gamal and 35 seconds with Paillier, and the communication of both schemes is much worse than our scheme. In comparison, our protocol executes in 0.23 seconds, making it 17 times and 150 times faster than the El Gamal and Paillier-based schemes, respectively.

### 6.3 Performance of Circuit PSI and qPSI

#### Circuit PSI
As discussed in Section 4, in steps 5 and 6 (Figure 6), we need to work over a prime field \( \mathbb{F}_p \) such that \( p > n \). The Mersenne prime \( 2^5 - 1 \) suffices for up to 30 parties and all the settings we consider. However, the smallest prime \( p \) for which the implementation of protocols for multiparty functionalities from Section 2.5 is available (at [20]) is the Mersenne prime \( 2^{31} - 1 \), which is excessive for our implementations. Based on the concrete communication analysis in Section 4.2, we observe that the communication in steps 5 and 6 using Mersenne prime 31 is < 8.2% of the communication involved in steps 1–4 of the protocol for the values of \( n, t, \) and \( m \) considered in our experiments. Moreover, the computations in these steps are arithmetic operations over the small field \( \mathbb{F}_{31} \). Hence, the performance of steps 1–4 of the protocol is a strong indicator of its overall performance.

We illustrate the performance of steps 1–4 in Table 5 when wPSM is instantiated using relaxed-batch OPPRF [13]. These numbers can be extrapolated to estimate the overall run-time of the protocol. For instance, we estimate our Circuit PSI protocol to take 12.19 seconds and 80.09 seconds in LAN and WAN settings, respectively, for 10 parties with \( t = 4 \) and input set size \( 2^{18} \).

#### qPSI
Protocol Quorum-I outperforms Quorum-II for the values of \( n, t, \) and \( m \) considered in our experiments (see Theorem 5.1). The aforementioned discussion in the context of the Circuit PSI protocol also applies to Protocol Quorum-I. From the concrete communication analysis in Appendix F.2, for the values of \( n, t, \) and \( m \) considered in the experiments, the communication in step 5 (see Figure 16) using Mersenne prime 31 is < 21% of the communication involved in steps 1–4 for all values of \( k \leq n-1 \). Therefore, for example, the run-time of the Quorum-I protocol can be estimated to be 5.49 seconds and 37.85 seconds in LAN and WAN settings, respectively, for 15 parties with \( t = 7 \), \( m = 2^{16} \), and any \( k \leq 14 \).
