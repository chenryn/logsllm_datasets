### Context and Introduction
The following content discusses the security of authenticated encryption in the Kerberos protocol, specifically focusing on the general and simplified profiles. The recommended instantiations with DES and MD4 or MD5 are noted to be insecure, and the paper explores the use of AES and collision-resistant hash functions as potential alternatives. However, it is highlighted that even with these secure primitives, the Encode-then-MAC-then-Encrypt construction does not provide integrity in general.

### General Profile of Authenticated Encryption in Kerberos
**Construction 3.1: General Profile**
- **Encoding Scheme**: 
  - The encoding scheme ensures unambiguous decoding.
  - A random confounder \( \text{conf} \) of \( n \) bits is chosen.
  - \( M_e \) is computed as \( \text{conf} \parallel M \).
  - \( M_t \) is computed as \( \text{conf} \parallel 0^l \parallel M \).
  - The pair \( (M_e, M_t) \) is returned.
- **Decoding Process**:
  - On input \( M_e \), it is parsed as \( \text{conf} \parallel M \).
  - \( M_t \) is computed as \( \text{conf} \parallel 0^l \parallel M \).
  - The pair \( (M, M_t) \) is returned.

**Theorem 3.3: Security Analysis**
- There exists an IND-CPA (Indistinguishability under Chosen Plaintext Attack) secure encryption scheme and a collision-resistant hash function such that the authenticated encryption obtained via the Encode-then-MAC-then-Encrypt construction (Construction 3.1) does not provide integrity (i.e., it is not INT-CTXT secure).
- The proof is detailed in the full version of the paper [15]. The proof also shows that the general construction is insecure even when a secure MAC is used, but in this case, the attack relies on a rather artificial IND-CPA scheme.
- The attacks provided in the proof do not translate into attacks on any of the recommended options; they only highlight a limitation in the general design.

### Modified General Profile
**Construction 3.4: Modified General Profile**
- **Modification**: 
  - A secure MAC (Message Authentication Code) is used instead of a hash function.
- **Theorem 3.5: Security of Modified Construction**
  - The authenticated encryption scheme described by the modified general profile (Construction 3.4) is IND-CCA (Indistinguishability under Chosen Ciphertext Attack) and INT-CTXT secure if the underlying block cipher is a Pseudorandom Function (PRF) and the MAC is UF-CMA (Unforgeable under Chosen Message Attack) secure.
  - The proof with concrete security results is provided in [15].
  - AES, believed to be a PRF, and HMAC, proven to be UF-CMA secure if its underlying hash function is collision-resistant [8], are good choices for the above design.

### Simplified Profile
**Designers' Intuition**
- The designers of Kerberos recognized that the general profile's design is not particularly strong and proposed a new design called the "simplified profile" (cf. Section 5 in [22] and [21]).

**Construction 3.6: Encode-then-Encrypt&MAC**
- **Encryption Scheme**: SE = (Ke, E, D)
- **MAC**: MAC = (Km, T)
- **Encoding Scheme**: EC = (Enc, Dec)
- **Encode-then-Encrypt&MAC Scheme**: SE' = (K', E', D')
  - **Key Generation**: K' runs Ke and Km and returns their outputs \( K_e \parallel K_m \).
  - **Encryption**:
    - On inputs \( K_e \parallel K_m \) and \( M \), first get the encodings \( (M_e, M_t) \).
    - Compute \( C \leftarrow E_{K_e}(M_e) \) and \( \sigma \leftarrow T_{K_m}(M_t) \).
    - Return \( C \parallel \sigma \).
  - **Decryption**:
    - On inputs \( K_e \parallel K_m \) and \( C \parallel \sigma \), compute \( M_e \leftarrow D_{K_e}(C) \).
    - Decode \( (M, M_t) \leftarrow Dec(M_e) \).
    - Compute \( \sigma' \leftarrow T_{K_m}(M_t) \).
    - Return \( M \) if \( \sigma = \sigma' \), and \( \bot \) otherwise.

**Construction 3.7: Authenticated Encryption in Kerberos (Simplified Profile)**
- **Block Cipher**: E: {0, 1}^k × {0, 1}^n → {0, 1}^n (e.g., AES)
- **Encryption Mode**: SE = (Ke, E, D) in CBC mode with IV = 0^n
- **MAC**: MAC = (Km, T)
- **Encoding Scheme**: Enc pads M to make its length a multiple of \( n \) bits, picks a random confounder \( \text{conf} \leftarrow \{0, 1\}^n \), computes \( M_e \leftarrow \text{conf} \parallel M \) and \( M_t \leftarrow \text{conf} \parallel M \), and returns \( (M_e, M_t) \).
- **Decoding**:
  - On input \( M_e \), parse it as \( \text{conf} \parallel M \).
  - Compute \( M_t \leftarrow M_e \) and return \( (M, M_t) \).

**Theorem 3.8: Security of Simplified Profile**
- The authenticated encryption scheme described by the simplified profile (Construction 3.7) is IND-CCA and INT-CTXT secure if the underlying block cipher is a PRF and the MAC is a PRF.
- The proof with concrete security results is in [15]. AES is believed to be a PRF, and HMAC has been proven to be a PRF [7], making them suitable choices for the simplified profile.
