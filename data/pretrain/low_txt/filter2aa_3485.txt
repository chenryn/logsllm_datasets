**Phase 0: Preparations**
Ensure the radio is in good working order on its original frequencies before conversion. If the radio does not produce at least 3 watts of output power, do not proceed until repairs are made.

**Phase 1: Operating Frequency Reprogramming**
1. Modify the original GE PCS Plus v6.0 software to allow out-of-range programming.
2. Copy `PCSP.EXE` to `PCSP220.EXE`.
3. Use a hex editor (e.g., XVI32) to edit `PCSP220.EXE`:
   - Hex Address: `&H1F778`
     - Original Data: `16`
     - New Data: `00`
   - Hex Address: `&H1F77C`
     - Original Data: `2E`
     - New Data: `61`

   This changes the programming range to 128 to 225 MHz. Transmit frequencies will display correctly, but receive frequencies must be programmed 90 MHz lower. For example, 223.500 MHz RX should be programmed as 133.500 MHz.

   **Testing:**
   - Channel 1: 223.500 MHz Simplex, 100 Hz PL Encode, High Power
   - Channel 2: 223.500 MHz Simplex, 100 Hz PL Encode, Low Power

**Phase 2: VCO Modification**
1. Open the radio and remove the rear assembly using a Torx T-10 screwdriver and a straight screwdriver to pry along the edges.
2. Remove the BNC connector by loosening the Allen set screw (0.050) on the rear casing, desoldering the center pin from the RF board, and unscrewing the BNC connector from the chassis.
3. Cut the trace on the RF board feeding the /PTT signal to the VCO assembly.
4. Install a logic inverter consisting of a surface-mount NPN transistor with a 10K 1/8 W resistor on the base lead. Solder the emitter to ground, the base resistor to P801, pin 7, and the collector to the solder pad just after the cut.

   This modification makes the VCO band select backwards, allowing it to run in the 222 MHz range on TX and around 178 MHz on RX.

**Phase 3: Low Pass Filter**
1. Remove the 33nH inductor at position L107 and replace it with a 22nH inductor. Wind 3 ½ turns of #22 wire on a 3/32” drill bit.
2. The magnet wire is available from Radio Hut in the 315 ft. Magnet Wire Kit #278-1345 (gold spool). Remove the enamel from the ends of the coil and tin it using a broad-tipped iron. Leave the coil on the drill bit while tinning to act as a heat sink.

**Phase 4: Receiver**
1. Install 4-40 - 3/8” brass screws in inductors L401, L402, L403, and L404. On some versions of LBI-38275, L404 is called L454 on the parts placement diagram. Gently insert the screws all the way into the coil forms.
2. Remove Z401, a tuned hybrid filter set for 136-174 MHz. Peel away the RF shielding surrounding the filter with needle-nose pliers and side cutters.
3. Bypass the filter with a single piece of wire bridged across the input and output pads, ensuring it does not contact the ground holes. The image frequency rejection is only 6-8dB with this method, so it is recommended to replace the front-end filter.

   **Replacement Image Rejection Filter:**
   - Components:
     - 2 x 4.7pF capacitors
     - 1 x 90-degree open coax stub cut to 133.5 MHz + 0.5” (15.25” for RG-174u)

   Install the new filter in the original position of Z401. Solder the capacitors to the I/O holes of Z401 and solder the outer conductor of the coax stub to ground.

**Phase 5a: 5W VHF Power Amplifier Replacement**
The MHW607-4 is specified for operation at 184 - 210 MHz and can replace the MHW607-2 currently in the radio. However, testing was inconclusive due to module availability, so its suitability for 220 - 225 MHz is unknown.

**Phase 5b: 5W VHF Power Amplifier Recycling**
1. Remove the MHW607-2 power amplifier from the RF board and remove the lid. Be careful not to damage the components under the lid.
2. There are two generations of modules. The later version uses a SAW filter after the final transistor.
3. Remove the surface-mount capacitor and coil in the upper left corner of the module. Wind a replacement inductor using 3 turns of #26 (green) wire on a 3/32” drill bit. Install the replacement inductor in the original position.
4. Cut a hole in the plastic cover to facilitate fine tuning of the inductor. The cover can be left off, but avoid touching the bonding wires on the module.
5. Reinstall the modified module onto the RF board. Reinstall the RF board in the chassis. Screw in the BNC connector and tighten the set screw before re-soldering to the RF board.

**Phase 6: Tuning**
1. Test Cable 19B801406P62 is needed to service the radio while open, connecting the front and rear assemblies together. Alternatively, construct a substitute cable using connectors salvaged from a dead PCS and 12-conductor ribbon cable.
2. Turn R119 fully clockwise. Set the radio to a channel programmed for high power.
3. Adjust the spacing of the coil installed at L107 for maximum RF output, as seen on a watt meter. Use a fingernail or small screwdriver to change the winding spacing.
4. If you recycled the RF power amplifier, adjust the spacing of the coil installed on it for maximum RF power. Be careful not to short-circuit the power module.
5. Readjust L107 and the PA until no additional improvement is seen. If the radio produces over 5W, adjust R119 to bring the power down to that level. Converted power modules were able to produce between 2 and 5 watts of output power.
6. Switch the radio to a channel programmed for low power and adjust R11 on the Power Control Board for 2W or the desired output setting.
7. Adjust R321 until 750 Hz of PL deviation is achieved.
8. If constructed, tune the image filter. Set a signal generator for the current receive frequency minus 90 MHz. Trim the stub for the lowest received signal, increasing the generator output as necessary.
9. Optimize the receiver’s sensitivity by tweaking the brass screws. Test radios achieved -117 to -118 dBm for 12 dB SINAD, with a squelch threshold around -120 to -122 dBm.
10. R608 sets the receiver’s squelch threshold. Refer to LBI-38623A for the procedure.
11. Remove the test cable and reassemble the radio.
