### 2013 Arrest of Ross Ulbricht

In October 2013, Ross Ulbricht, a San Francisco resident, was arrested and charged with operating the Silk Road marketplace [8]. A significant amount of data was subsequently entered into evidence during his trial in January 2015. This included detailed accounting entries found on Ulbricht's laptop, which were claimed to pertain to Silk Road. Chat transcripts (evidence GX226A, GX227C) indicated weekly sales volumes of $475,000 in late March 2012, consistent with previous reports [13] used for documenting Silk Road. Evidence GX250 contained a personal ledger that appeared to accurately document Silk Road sales commissions. Projecting the data from the previous study [13] ($680,279) over a year yields an annual projection of about $1.2 million, closely aligning with Christin’s estimate of $1.1 million [13]. This suggests that using feedback as a sales proxy, a technique we also employ, produces reliable estimates.

### 2014 Arrest of Blake Benthall

In November 2014, another San Francisco resident, Blake Benthall, was arrested and charged with being "Defcon," the administrator of Silk Road 2.0. The criminal complaint against Benthall [7] reported that in September 2014, he told an undercover agent working on Silk Road 2’s staff that monthly sales were around $6 million, later revised to $8 million. This corresponds to a daily sales volume of $200,000–$250,000, which is very close to our reported figures for Silk Road 2 at that time (Figure 5).

### Leaked Agora Vendor Page

In December 2014, it was revealed that an Agora vendor page had been scraped and leaked on Pastebin [21]. This page contained a subset of the vendor’s transactions, allowing us to estimate the vendor’s sales on June 5, 2014, at $3,460. Our database estimated the seller’s sales at $3,408 on that day, which, considering Bitcoin exchange rate fluctuations, is nearly identical to the ground truth.

### Ethical Considerations in Data Collection

We share many of the ethical concerns and views documented in previous work [13]. Our data collection is extensive and could potentially strain the Tor network and marketplace servers. However, we believe our measurements represent a small fraction of the total traffic to online anonymous marketplaces. As discussed in Section 3, we balance the accuracy of data collection with a lightweight crawling strategy to avoid detection or disruption. Additionally, we contribute long-uptime, high-speed Tor relays to compensate for our use of the network. We take steps to remain neutral and do not aim to facilitate arrests of vendors or marketplace operators. This is both an ethical and scientific necessity: our measurements should not impact the subjects being studied [23].

### Public Policy Implications

The primary goal of this work is to provide a critical evaluation of public policy toward online anonymous marketplaces. While members of Congress have called for the takedown of such marketplaces, it is unclear if this is the most pragmatic use of taxpayer money. Our measurements suggest that the ecosystem is resilient to law enforcement takedowns. For example, the original Silk Road takedown did not significantly disrupt the market. Operation Onymous, while consolidating transactions in the two dominant marketplaces, did not eliminate demand. Economics indicate that as long as there is user demand for drugs online, enterprising individuals will continue to meet this demand.

A complete eradication of online anonymous marketplaces through a cat-and-mouse game between law enforcement and operators seems unlikely. Given the high costs and international coordination required for operations like Operation Onymous, alternative solutions may be more effective. Reducing demand through prevention and targeted interventions, such as seizing highly dangerous products in transit, could be more practical. Traditional police work has shown success in addressing the issue in the physical world [35, 4, 6].

### Related Work

Over the past decade, numerous research efforts have aimed to gather measurements from various online criminal ecosystems to develop meaningful defenses [13, 14, 22, 26, 27, 28, 29, 32, 40, 41]. Anderson et al. [11] and Thomas et al. [37] provide comprehensive overviews. McCoy et al. [29] obtained detailed measurements of online pharmaceutical affiliates, showing that individual networks grossed between $12.8 million and $67.7 million annually. In comparison, the long-term rough average for the entire online anonymous marketplace ecosystem is around $150–180 million per year, indicating that these markets have surpassed traditional methods of delivering illicit narcotics.

Our paper builds on previous work [13] and complements other efforts to quantify the economics of online anonymous marketplaces. Aldridge and Décary-Hétu [10] provided revised estimates of around $90 million per year for Silk Road in 2013, which aligns with our measurements. Dolliver [17] attempted to assess volumes on Silk Road 2.0 but did not report specific numbers, and her seller counts were lower than ours, suggesting incomplete data. Meiklejohn et al. [31] analyzed Bitcoin transaction traceability, providing a useful method for assessing marketplace volumes. Follow-up work [30] showed that Bitcoin anonymity is often overstated.

On the customer side, Barratt et al. [12] surveyed Silk Road patrons, finding that many associate with the "party culture," corroborated by our results showing that cannabis and ecstasy account for roughly half of sales. Van Hout and Bingham [39] provided valuable insights into individual participants. Our research complements these efforts by offering a macro-level view of the ecosystem.

### Conclusions

Despite their relatively recent emergence, anonymous online marketplaces have reached daily volumes of up to $650,000 (averaged over 30-day windows), generally stable around $300,000-$500,000 per day, far exceeding previous reports. These marketplaces are extremely resilient to takedowns and scams, highlighting the role of economic demand. We suggest a re-evaluation of intervention policies, as takedowns may not be effective. Banning anonymous networks would likely shift demand to other channels, losing some benefits associated with these markets, such as reduced violence at the retail level. Instead, focusing on reducing consumer demand through prevention and more targeted interventions may be more effective. Our data collection methodology and the data we have collected can enable further research in this field.
