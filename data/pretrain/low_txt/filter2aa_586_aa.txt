## Agenda

1. Hosted VoIP Services and Cisco 101
2. Network Infrastructure
3. Cisco Unified Communications Manager
4. IP Phone and Service Management
5. Attacking Desktop and Mobile Clients

## Hosted VoIP Services

- **Cisco VoIP Environment:**
  - Web-based services
  - IP Phone services (Cisco, VOSS)
  - Tenant client services (VOSS Selfcare)
  - Tenant* management services (Cisco HCS)
  - VoIP services
  - Skinny (SCCP) services for Cisco phones
  - SIP services for other tenant phones
  - RTP services for media streaming
  - PBX/ISDN gateways, network equipment
  - *Tenant: Customer of hosted VoIP service

## Goals

- Discover VoIP network configuration, design, and requirements
- Find Voice VLAN and gain access
- Gain access using PC port on IP Phone
- Understand switching security:
  - Main vendor for VoIP infrastructure
  - Network authentication requirements
  - VLAN ID and requirements
  - IP Phone management services
  - Supportive services in use

## Protected and Isolated?

- **Switching Manipulation:**
  - Attack Types:
    - PC Ports of the IP phone and handsets
    - CDP sniffing/spoofing for Voice VLAN
    - DTP and VLAN Trunking Protocol attacks
    - ARP spoofing for MITM attacks
    - DHCP spoofing & snooping
    - Persistent access: Tapberry Pi, tampered phone, Power over Ethernet (PoE), 3G/4G for connectivity

## Attacking the TFTP Server

- Obtaining configuration files for MAC addresses (e.g., SEPDefault.cnf, SIPDefault.cnf)
- Identifying SIP, Skinny, RTP, and web settings
- Finding IP phone software and updates
- Configuration files may contain credentials
- Digital signature/encryption usage for files
- **Tip:** TFTPTheft, Metasploit, Viproy TFTP module

## Becoming the TFTP Server

- Send fake configurations for:
  - HTTP server
  - IP phone management server
  - SIP server and proxy
  - Skinny server
  - RTP server and proxy
- Deploy SSH public keys for SSH on IP Phones
- Update custom settings of IP Phones
- Deploy custom OS update and code execution
- **Tip:** Metasploit TFTP & FakeDNS servers, Viproy MITM proxy

## Unified Communications

- Forget TDM and PSTN
- SIP, Skinny, H.248, RTP, MSAN/MGW, smart customer modems & phones
- **Cisco UCM:**
  - Linux operating system
  - Web-based management services
  - VoIP services (Skinny, SIP, RTP)
  - Essential network services (TFTP, DHCP)
  - Call centre, voicemail, value-added services

## Discovering VoIP Servers

- **Looking for:**
  - Signalling servers (e.g., SIP, Skinny, H.323, H.248)
  - Proxy servers (e.g., RTP, SIP, SDP)
  - Contact Centre services
  - Voicemail and email integration
  - Call recordings, call data records, log servers
- **Discovering:**
  - Operating systems, versions, and patch levels
  - Management services (e.g., SNMP, Telnet, HTTP, SSH)
  - Weak or default credentials

## Attacking SIP Services

- **Essential Analysis:**
  - Registration and invitation analysis
  - User enumeration, brute force for credentials
  - Discovery for SIP trunks, gateways, and trusts
  - Caller ID spoofing (with or without register or trunk)
- **Advanced Analysis:**
  - Finding value-added services and voicemail
  - SIP trust hacking
  - SIP proxy bounce attack

## Cisco Specific SIP Registration

- Extensions (e.g., 1001)
- MAC address in Contact field
- SIP digest authentication (user + password)
- SIP x.509 authentication
- All authentication elements must be valid
- **Good news:** We have SIP enumeration inputs!
- **Warnings:**
  - 399 bhcucm "Line not configured"
  - 399 bhcucm "Unable to find device/user in database"
  - 399 bhcucm "Unable to find a device handler for the request received on port 52852 from 192.168.0.101"
  - 399 bhcucm "Device type mismatch"

## Register and Subscribe

- **Register / Subscribe (FROM, TO, Credentials):**

## Invite, CDR, and Billing Tests

- **Invite / Ack / Re-Invite / Update (FROM, TO, VIA, Credentials):**

## SIP Proxy Bounce Attack

- **SIP Trust Relationship Hacking:**
  - Attacking inaccessible servers
  - Attacking the SIP software and protocol
  - Software, Version, Type, Realm
- **Example:**
  - 192.168.1.146 - Melbourne
  - 192.168.1.202 - Brisbane
  - 192.168.1.145 - Sydney (Production SIP Service)

## Denial of Service Attacks

- **SIP Based DoS Attacks:**
  - UDP vulnerabilities and IP spoofing
  - Too many errors, very verbose mode
  - ICMP errors
- **Example:**
  - 192.168.1.146 - Melbourne
  - 192.168.1.202 - Brisbane
  - 192.168.1.145 - Sydney (Production SIP Service)
  - Alderaan (IP spoofed UDP SIP request)

## Hacking SIP Trust Relationships

- **Send INVITE/MESSAGE requests with:**
  - IP spoofing (source is Brisbane)
  - From field contains Spoofed IP and Port
  - The caller ID will be your trusted host
- **Example:**
  - 192.168.1.146 - Melbourne
  - 192.168.1.202 - Brisbane
  - 192.168.1.145 - Sydney (Production SIP Service)
  - Tatooine (UDP Trust, Universal Trust)

## Attacking a Client Using SIP Trust

- **Send INVITE/MESSAGE requests with:**
  - IP spoofing (source is Brisbane)
  - From field contains special number
  - You will have fun or voicemail access
- **Example:**
  - 192.168.1.146 - Melbourne
  - 192.168.1.202 - Brisbane
  - 192.168.1.145 - Sydney (Production SIP Service)
  - Tatooine (UDP Trust, Universal Trust)

## Toll Fraud for CUCM

- **Cisco UCM accepts MAC address as identity:**
  - No authentication (secure deployment?)
  - Rogue SIP gateway with no authentication
  - Caller ID spoofing with proxy headers (Via, From, P-Asserted-Identity, P-Called-Party-ID, P-Preferred-Identity, ISDN Calling Party Number, Remote-Party-ID)
  - Billing bypass with proxy headers (P-Charging-Vector, Re-Invite, Update)

## Caller ID Spoofing on CUCM

- **Remote-Party-ID header:**
  - Remote-Party-ID: ;party=called;screen=yes;privacy=off
  - **Uses:**
    - Caller ID spoofing
    - Billing bypass
    - Accessing voicemail
    - 3rd party operators

## Caller ID Fraud for All Operators?

- **Telecom operators trust source Caller ID:**
  - One insecure operator to rule them all

## Fake Caller ID for Messages?

- **Call me back function on voicemail/calls:**
  - Sending many spoofed messages for DoS
  - Overseas? Roaming?
  - Social engineering (voicemail notification)
  - Value-added services (e.g., adding a data package, subscribing to mobile TV, resetting passwords/PINs/2FA, group messages, celebrations)
