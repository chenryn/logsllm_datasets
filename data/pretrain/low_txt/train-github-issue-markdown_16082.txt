### Issue Description

When I include `debugger` keywords in my code and connect my IDE to the Node.js debugger, the breakpoints are set in the compiled code rather than the uncompiled source code. This issue seems to be related to the absence of sourcemaps for custom code and pages. 

By default, the `commons.js` and `main.js` files follow the sourcemap settings specified in the Webpack configuration (`devtool: 'cheap-module-eval-source-map'`). However, sourcemaps are not being generated for custom code and pages, which makes debugging on the server side difficult.

I suspect this might be related to the custom Babel settings used for Node.js, as seen in the Next.js repository:
- [Next.js Babel Configuration](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/blob/v3-beta/server/build/webpack.js#L205)

### Expected Behavior

The compiled custom code in the `.next/dist` folder should have sourcemaps generated according to the settings in Webpack and Babel. This would allow for proper debugging by mapping the compiled code back to the original source code.

### Current Behavior

Sourcemaps are not generated for custom code and pages, making server-side debugging challenging. However, sourcemaps are correctly generated and accessible for client-side code.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. **Create a Next.js Project:**
   - Initialize a new Next.js project with a `index.js` page.
   - Ensure that sourcemaps are enabled (this is the default setting at the time of writing).

2. **Start the Development Server:**
   - Run the command `next` to start the development server.

3. **Check for Sourcemaps in Custom Code:**
   - Open the file `.next/dist/pages/index.js` and scroll to the bottom.
   - Notice that there is no `//# sourceMappingURL` comment, indicating that sourcemaps are not being generated for this custom code.

4. **Check for Sourcemaps in Main Code:**
   - Open the file `.next/dist/main.js` and scroll to the bottom.
   - Observe that there is a `//# sourceMappingURL` comment, confirming that sourcemaps are generated for this file.

### Additional Information

- I have searched the issues in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
- The problem specifically affects server-side debugging, while client-side debugging works as expected.

Thank you for your attention to this issue.
