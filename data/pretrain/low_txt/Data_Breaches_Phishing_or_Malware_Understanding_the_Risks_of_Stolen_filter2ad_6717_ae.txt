### 6.3 Location of Users
We examined the last login geolocation for all Gmail accounts that received stolen credentials to provide a perspective on the geographic usage of blackhat tools. We note that if a single miscreant controls multiple exfiltration points, we may overcount their location. Additionally, we cannot rule out the possibility of proxies obfuscating the true location of miscreants. Table 12 provides a breakdown of the top 10 geolocations for phishing kit users and keylogger users.

We found that 41.5% of exfiltration points for phishing kits were last accessed in Nigeria, followed by the United States, Morocco, and South Africa. This differs significantly from the geolocations of hijackers accessing the accounts of victims as reported by Bursztein et al. [5] (predominantly China) and Onaolapo et al. [31] (predominantly tailored to the victim’s historical geolocation to evade risk detection or Tor). This suggests that the infrastructure used by miscreants to steal credentials is independent from the devices used by hijackers to access accounts. Compared to the targets of phishing (discussed previously in Table 7), victims largely come from North America and Europe, while blackhat users originate from Africa and Southeast Asia.

For keyloggers, we find a more diverse ecosystem, with a small fraction of users spanning every continent. Still, Nigeria takes the top place, accounting for 11.2% of exfiltration points. We also observe a coupling between the targets of keyloggers (discussed previously in Table 7) and the geolocations of miscreants. Brazil, India, the United States, Turkey, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, and Nigeria appear in both top 10 lists. Iran, not listed in Table 7, makes up 2.7% of blackhat users, and Indonesia 1.4%. This coupling suggests that blackhat users favor local victims.

### 6.4 Web Cloaking
Phishing kits commonly have built-in cloaking capabilities to redirect crawlers or users behind proxies (perceived to be security analysts) away from deceptive content to impede detection. By manually investigating a random sample of phishing kits, we identified two dominant cloaking implementations. The first, present in 652 kits, relies on setting an .htaccess policy to deny access to over 500 IP address prefixes, some of which relate to brand and trademark monitoring services. The second technique, present in 182 kits, relies on a PHP script that checks an embedded `blacklist.dat` file consisting of over 1,300 IP address prefixes. Based on annotations in the blacklist file, these addresses belong to cloud providers like Google, Amazon, and OVH; security crawlers like PhishTank and other anti-virus brands; and anonymous proxies like Tor. Other cloaking strategies rely on anti-fraud protections provided by MaxMind and FraudLabs Pro that detect proxies or anonymous access—in this case, repurposed to flag inorganic users accessing phishing pages. Overall, the cloaking strategies of kits match those reported by Invernizzi et al. [22] as popular among blackhat search engine optimization, indicating a common core of blackhat technologies.

### 7. Discussion
#### Mitigation Techniques
The scale of black market activity surrounding stolen credentials highlights the fragility of authentication schemes based solely on usernames and passwords. Many online services have enhanced their identity services beyond "something you know" to include approximations of "something you have," while avoiding the overhead of requiring a mobile device or hardware token. As discussed in Section 5, this can include a user's device profiles (e.g., User-Agents or machine identifiers) or a user's physical location. However, these additional factors are not intractable for attackers to identify, collect, and impersonate. For geolocation, this means selecting a network proxy in the vicinity of a hijacking target. Despite these limitations, adapting authentication schemes to include risk profiles significantly reduces the danger from having valid passwords exposed in credential leaks or bundled and traded without the full user profile.

Immediate solutions to the shortcomings of risk profiles include migrating users to unphishable two-factor authentication (2FA) or password managers that associate credentials with specific domains. While these schemes are susceptible to malware, our results suggest that the threat posed by credential leaks and phishing is orders of magnitude larger than keyloggers at present. Nevertheless, as Bonneau et al. point out, there are various barriers to adopting 2FA and password managers, including ease-of-use, recovery from loss, and trusting third parties [3]. User knowledge of these schemes is also spotty [1, 23]. Our own results indicate that less than 3.1% of victims who fall prey to hijacking subsequently enable any form of two-factor authentication after recovering their account. Therefore, user education remains a major initiative for enhancing account security.

#### Evolution of Black Market Tools
Compared to the capabilities of keyloggers and phishing kits dating back to the mid-2000s (Section 2), we observe a marked lack of pressure on blackhat developers to evolve their core technologies. Phishing kits reported nearly a decade ago still rely on the same PHP skeleton and approach for reporting stolen credentials. The only modifications have been to collect new challenge questions and ancillary authentication details. Similarly, all keylogger variants in our study provide identical capabilities, with only the interface and customer support differing. Our findings illustrate that despite significant research in the space, Internet users continue to fall victim to the same threats.

### 8. Conclusion
In this work, we presented the first longitudinal measurement study of how miscreants obtain stolen credentials and subsequently bypass risk-based authentication schemes to hijack a victim’s account. In total, we identified 788,000 potential victims of off-the-shelf keyloggers, 12.4 million potential victims of phishing kits, and 1.9 billion usernames and passwords exposed via data breaches and traded on black market forums. Through a combination of password reuse across thousands of online services and targeted collection, we estimated that 7–25% of stolen passwords in our dataset would enable an attacker to log in to a victim’s Google account and thus take over their online identity due to transitive trust. However, we showed how blocking login attempts that fail to match a user’s historical login behavior or device profile helps mitigate the risk of data breaches and keyloggers, and to a lesser extent, phishing. We are now using these insights to improve our login defenses for all users. Our findings illustrate the global reach of the underground economy surrounding credential theft and the need to educate users about password managers and unphishable two-factor authentication as a potential solution.
