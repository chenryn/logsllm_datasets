### 6.5 Density of Special Interest Groups

In various complex networks, such as online social networks, each vertex (user) is associated with multiple labels representing group affiliations, such as user interests or geolocation. For example, in the Flickr graph, 21% of users belong to one or more special interest groups [26]. Let \( L \) denote the set of groups in the Flickr graph and \( \theta_l \) denote the fraction of vertices that belong to group \( l \in L \).

In our simulations, we estimate \( \theta_l \) using Frontier Sampling (FS) with \( m = 100 \), SingleRW, and MultipleRW (with \( m = 100 \)) with a budget \( B = |V|/100 \). Figure 14 shows the Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE) from 10,000 runs for the 200 most popular groups, ordered by decreasing popularity. FS outperforms both SingleRW and MultipleRW. Even when restricting the random walks to the largest connected component, FS still significantly outperforms MultipleRW (with \( m = 100 \)) and SingleRW.

### 6.6 Global Clustering Coefficient Estimates

In our final set of experiments, we evaluate the accuracy of estimating the global clustering coefficient using FS, SingleRW, and MultipleRW. Our simulations show a small difference between FS (with \( m = 1000 \)), SingleRW, and MultipleRW (with \( m = 1000 \)). Let \( C \) be the true value of the global clustering coefficient and \( \hat{C} \) denote its estimated value. Table 3 presents the empirical value of \( E[\hat{C}] \) and the empirical NMSE of the clustering coefficient, given by:

\[
\text{NMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{E[(\hat{C} - C)^2]}{C}}
\]

over 10,000 runs of FS, SingleRW, and MultipleRW on the Flickr and LiveJournal graphs. From the results in Table 3, we see that FS accurately estimates the global clustering coefficient and has smaller error than both SingleRW and MultipleRW.

**Table 3: Global clustering coefficient estimates.**

| Graph      | B    | C     | FS (m = 1000)   | SingleRW | MultipleRW (m = 1000) |
|------------|------|-------|-----------------|----------|-----------------------|
| Flickr     | 1%   | 0.14  | 0.13 (0.04)     | 0.12 (0.33) | 0.16 (0.18)           |
| LiveJournal| 1%   | 0.16  | 0.16 (0.02)     | 0.16 (0.02) | 0.17 (0.06)           |

### 7. Related Work

This section reviews related literature. FS can be classified as a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Other MCMC-based methods have been applied to characterize complex networks, including estimating population characteristics [36], content density in peer-to-peer networks [16, 23, 29, 35], uniformly sampling web pages from the Internet [17, 33], and uniformly sampling web pages from a search engine's index [4]. These methods often use random walks to sample vertices uniformly (also known as Metropolized Random Walks or Metropolis-RW) [16, 17, 33, 4, 35]. The accuracy of RW and Metropolis-RW (MRW) is compared in [15, 29], and in various experiments, RW estimates are shown to be consistently more accurate than or equal to MRW estimates.

The above literature does not consider the use of multiple random walks to address the problem of estimating characteristics of disconnected or loosely connected graphs. While multiple independent random walkers have been used as a convergence test, our simulations in Section 6 show that independent walkers are not suited to sample loosely connected graphs when starting vertices are selected uniformly at random.

Many real complex networks have disconnected or loosely connected components. A significant body of MCMC literature addresses the locality problem described in Section 4.3. However, these solutions often assume that the graph is highly structured or completely known, making them inapplicable to our problem. A comprehensive list of MCMC methods and their characteristics can be found in [32].

Projecting a random walk onto a higher-dimensional space has been used in [9] to make the Markov chain nonreversible, which can speed up mixing. However, it is unclear if this method can be successfully used to estimate characteristics of complex networks.

In networks that cannot be crawled (e.g., the Internet topology), samples must be obtained along shortest paths, and vertex degrees cannot be queried. [1] shows that observed vertex degrees are biased. Our work assumes a graph can be crawled and vertex degrees queried, allowing for an unbiased estimator. Multiple random walks also find other applications, such as collecting web data [10], searching P2P networks [6, 38], and decreasing the time to discover new wireless nodes [2]. Dependent multiple random walks are also used in percolation theory [3].

### 8. Discussion and Future Work

In this work, we presented a new and promising random walk-based method, Frontier Sampling (FS), which mitigates estimation errors caused by subgraphs that "trap" a random walker. FS uses multiple (m) mutually dependent random walkers starting from vertices sampled uniformly at random. The FS samples are shown to be the projection (onto the original graph) of a special type of m-dimensional (single) random walker. Simulations over real-world graphs in Section 6 show that FS is more robust than single and multiple independent random walkers (starting out of steady state) for estimating in-degree distributions and the fraction of users belonging to a social group. We also present evidence, using an analytical argument and simulations, that random walks (particularly FS) are better suited to estimate the tail (all degrees greater than the average) of degree distributions than random vertex sampling. FS can also be made fully distributed without incurring coordination or communication costs.

The ideas behind FS have far-reaching implications, from estimating characteristics of dynamic networks to designing new MCMC-based approximation algorithms.
