### First Principles
- **Scott Culp's Law:** "If a bad guy can persuade you to run his program on your computer, it's not your computer anymore."
- **Kenn White's Addition:** "Even if it has disk encryption."

### Post-Snowden Era
- **NSA Spending:** $250M/year to counter and undermine ubiquitous encryption across the internet (NYT, ProPublica, Guardian)
- **NIST Standards:** Intentionally weakened
- **BULLRUN Program:** NSA actively working to insert vulnerabilities into commercial encryption systems, IT systems, networks, and endpoint communications devices (The New York Times, 2013/09/05)
- **NIST Response:** Reviewing existing cryptographic work, recommending full support for encryption standards (Presidential Advisory Committee, Jan 2014)
- **DRBG Removal:** NIST removed DRBG due to heightened concerns over backdoors (National Institute of Standards and Technology, Apr 2014)

### The TrueCrypt Story
- **Overview:** File, volume, and full disk encryption tool
- **Downloads:** Over 30 million
- **Creation:** February 2004 by an anonymous development team
- **License:** Controversial (Debian, Fedora, forbidden items)
- **Users:** Human rights workers, activists, attorneys, organizations, investigative/national security journalists, security professionals
- **Issues:**
  - Never thoroughly audited on Windows
  - Differences in volume headers
  - Small differences in distributed binaries vs. source
  - Variations between Windows, Mac, and Linux versions
  - No formal cryptanalysis except for deniability volume
  - Deterministic build concerns
  - Last license review in 2008 by RedHat/Fedora/OSSI concluded non-free status

**Performance:** Relatively strong by many measures (e.g., hashes/sec on Sagitta Brutalis 290X)
