### Services Included in Our Scans

The second tool we used was HP Web Jetadmin [17, 18], a software solution developed and distributed by HP. This tool assists system administrators in configuring, monitoring, and managing both HP and some non-HP networked print devices. The discovery process leverages the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) [19]. However, according to an HP document, devices using an SNMP Get community name other than "public" will not be discovered by the tool [20].

### Tool Installation and Configuration

We installed and ran version 8.1 of HP Web Jetadmin on a computer located on the University of Maryland campus. Although this version is no longer supported or updated by HP, we chose it because it is compatible with both Windows and Linux operating systems. It was also crucial to run the software from an on-campus location, as SNMP traffic is blocked from entering or leaving the campus network. This limitation restricts the tool's utility to scanning on-campus devices from an on-campus host. However, if an attacker has access to a compromised on-campus machine, they could install and use the tool to gather information from off-campus.

### Capabilities and Limitations of HP Web Jetadmin

While the HP Web Jetadmin scan may have limitations in terms of the devices it can discover and the requirement to be run from a host directly connected to the campus network, it offers the advantage of collecting a more detailed set of information about the devices using default settings. This includes device-specific details such as hardware configuration (e.g., presence and size of internal disk drives), installed firmware versions, and the status of security-related settings (e.g., the use of administrative passwords). Often, the same information can be obtained through the device's management interfaces (via a web browser or telnet client), but it may require more effort to collect. A more comprehensive collection and analysis of information via SNMP could provide additional useful insights into configurations and vulnerabilities, but this was beyond the scope of our study. Our primary interest was in using HP Web Jetadmin as an alternative method for device discovery to compare with the nmap scan results.

### Initial Subnet Scans

Both tools were first used to scan two smaller subnets with a total of approximately 300 active IP addresses. These subnets were chosen because we had physical access to all machines attached to the network, allowing us to verify the scan results. We focused on devices directly connected to the network and excluded printers attached to PCs with network sharing enabled.

There was considerable overlap in the devices found by both tools. However, there were instances where only one tool indicated the presence of a device. For example, if some default services were disabled or access to services was restricted, an nmap scan might not have gathered sufficient information to identify the device. Conversely, if SNMP support was absent or disabled, the device might only appear in the nmap scan results. While it is possible that some devices of interest were not detected due to secure configurations, we did not encounter such cases in our small-scale testing.

### Threat Model: STRIDE

The STRIDE threat model, originally developed by Microsoft, categorizes threats as follows:

- **Spoofing Identity**: Impersonating an authorized user to gain access or convey misinformation.
  - Using someone elseâ€™s credentials to access the device.
  - Sending something from the device as someone else.
  
- **Tampering with Data**: Altering, deleting, or adding information stored on or during transmission with the device.
  - Eavesdropping and altering communications with the device.
  - Canceling print jobs or deleting stored documents of another user.
  
- **Repudiation**: Bypassing accounting or logging functions so that a record of usage or actions is not created or accurate.
  - Disabling logging functions.
  - Bypassing authentication for accessing or using the device.
  
- **Information Disclosure**: Document contents, log files, and other usage information accessible to unauthorized users.
  - Unauthorized viewing or downloading of stored documents.
  - Eavesdropping on communication with the device.
  - Accessing content during communication with the device.
  - Unauthorized viewing of device log information.
  
- **Denial of Service**: Normal use of the device is disrupted.
  - Changing access settings to deny normal access.
  - Exhausting resources so that none are available for normal use.
  - Disrupting normal information and communication with the device.
  
- **Elevation of Privilege**: A user or attacker increases their rights and access to the device without authorization.
  - Unauthorized access to administrative settings to enable restricted functions.

### Vulnerabilities

Several resources describe and discuss vulnerabilities related to networked office devices. Some are consolidated into references or guides [21, 22], while others can be found in vulnerability databases [23] and vendor-released information [24].

Exploitation of software/firmware vulnerabilities is not always required for these devices to pose risks to privacy and security. In some cases, simply using the device with its default configuration can present vulnerabilities to various threats. For example, if users are unaware that scanned or copied documents are stored and publicly accessible, the threat of information disclosure is applicable. If network access control lists (ACLs) are set but do not cover all forms of management access and are not protected by a password, then elevation of privilege and denial of service threats apply.

We looked for the presence of several different types of vulnerabilities in configurations or software/firmware that could be mapped to threats of most concern to the university and/or likely to be applicable to a large number of devices. Not all applicable vulnerabilities were evaluated.

The highest concern was the information disclosure of personally identifiable information (PII). The primary vulnerability examined was configurations that permitted public access to stored documents (to either on or off-campus networks). The threat of privilege elevation from off-campus was judged to be next in importance, followed by the threat of on-campus privilege elevation. We were also interested in gauging the denial of service threat but deemed it of less concern for immediate remediation efforts.

### Data Gathering

We performed initial nmap scans for both of the Class B network address spaces allocated to the university. The output of the initial scan was used to identify candidates for more detailed follow-up scanning. The results were parsed using Perl scripts, and additional data collection was performed. While additional scripts were used to collect data, some information was collected or verified manually. The following are some of the information we were interested in obtaining, though not all information could be gathered for each host:

- **Open Ports**: By parsing the nmap output, we established a list of devices and their open ports. Hosts were identified as candidate devices and subject to additional checks based on the set of listening ports.
- **Device Name/Model**: If a web interface was accessible, it often displayed a default or index page indicating the manufacturer and/or model of the device. This information was retrieved using regular expressions to parse the HTML source of the default web page. For some devices, this information could also be obtained through telnet or rsh management interfaces or by manual viewing.
- **Telnet Availability and Password**: If the telnet port was open, we used an Expect script [25] to test if a password was required for access. The script output allowed us to assess whether the telnet service was reachable and if it required a login and password or could be accessed without a password.
- **FTP Availability and Password**: We checked if the FTP port was open and whether it was password-protected using an Expect script similar to the one used for telnet availability.
- **Accessibility Off-Campus**: We scanned for open ports from an off-campus IP address and compared the results to scans from an on-campus IP address.
- **Web Interface Password**: If a password was required to access some administrative settings via the web interface, some devices would display a slightly different default page. We parsed the HTML source of the page to look for elements indicating a password was required for administrative access. Another check was to attempt to access certain URLs on the device, which would require a password if one had been set. Many devices made by the same manufacturer use similar directory structures for their web interfaces. If access was permitted to the default web page but denied to a normally protected area, this could indicate that a password was needed to access the protected area.
- **Number of Publicly Available Documents**: For devices that allowed access to document server functions, manual checks using the web interface were performed to count the number of publicly available documents and to assess if documents with PII or other sensitive content were accessible.

In addition to the nmap scans and related scripts, we used the HP Web Jetadmin tool to perform device discovery and data collection. We then processed, compared, and combined the results with the nmap data. For devices discoverable with the HP Web Jetadmin tool, more information could be obtained in an automated fashion. However, much of the information available via the SNMP protocol is also accessible through other device management interfaces (telnet/rsh/web). Additional information collected using the HP Web Jetadmin tool included the firmware version and the amount of internal storage space present.
