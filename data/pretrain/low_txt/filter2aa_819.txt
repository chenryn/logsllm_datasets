#### Standard Disclosure
None of the views, statements, or opinions expressed in this presentation reflect in any way the opinions of my employer.

### Current State of Wi-Fi Scanning
Wi-Fi is nearly ubiquitous, but...
- Increasing layers of security mean varying levels of access and usefulness.
- Simply finding a large number of Access Points (APs) is no longer sufficient because:
  - Knowing an AP exists doesn't provide much useful information.
  - Manual configuration and checks are tedious and time-consuming.
  - This is especially true for large numbers of APs.
  - And, let's be honest, I'm pretty lazy.

### The Inspiration for Wicrawl
#### AP Information Gathering
- Having WEP no longer means we can't get on an access point (WEP is dead).
- An "open" AP no longer guarantees easy access.
- There is much more information to gather after association.

### Moving Forward
What we really care about:
- **Penetration Testing** (Security Professionals)
- **Finding Rogue Access Points** (IT Administrators)
- **Getting (and staying) on the internet** (Business Travelers)
- **Finding "useful or interesting" access points** (Hackers, Slackers, and Code-crackers)

### What's Behind That AP?
- The magical land of Narnia, or the soft, chewy underbelly of your corporate network being exposed?
- Need to filter, crawl, and examine...

### Penetration Testing Wi-Fi
- **Traditional Penetration Testing**:
  - General Confidentiality/Integrity/Availability
  - Similar methodology to other pen-testing activities
    - Reconnaissance
    - Discovery, scanning, and enumeration (foot-printing)
    - Vulnerability/Security/Posture assessment
  - Many individual tools
- **Rogue Access Point Checks**:
  - A $20 device can often subvert all security.
  - Classic eggshell problem: "How many rogue APs does it take to get to the center of your network?"

### Wi-Fi Pen-testing Difficulties
- **AP Quantity and Density**:
  - More Wi-Fi gear (antennas, amplifiers, etc.) makes it harder to find rogue APs.
  - Takes a lot of time to scan, crawl, or crack (e.g., WPA PSK).
  - Hackers have more time than auditors.
  - Multiple tools, but setup, configuration, and running them takes time.
- **Geographic Issues**:
  - Multi-level shared buildings, reflections, latency.
- **Rogue Access Points**:
  - Hard to determine if an AP is authorized for scanning.
  - Baselines don't exist.
  - Client traffic and detection can be bursty.
  - Ultimately, you can't prove a negative.

### Common Tools
- **Discovery**:
  - Kismet, Wellenreiter, NetStumbler, Kismac, iStumbler
- **WEP**:
  - Aircrack-ng suite (wepcracking, arp injection, client de-authing, WPA crack, WPA brute-forcing, chopchop, fragmentation, dumping, tunneling, etc.)
  - Wesside, Easside, Airbase, Picocrack, Weplab
- **WPA**:
  - coWPAtty, Rainbow tables genpmk, Aircrack-ng
- **Attacking the Client-Side**:
  - Karma, Hotspotter
- **Others**:
  - Asleap, THC-LEAPcracker, Pickupline, LORCON, wifitap, void11
  - Non-specific tools like nmap, Nessus, and Metasploit

### /dev/urandom Notes
- **Wordlists** are important; many passwords are based on company/product data or default passwords.
- Check out wyd: [Remote-Exploit.org](http://www.remote-exploit.org/codes_wyd.html)
- Antennas don't need to be pointed directly at the target to be effective.
- People will look at you funny (and suspiciously).

### How Wicrawl Can Help
- **New Features for Pen-testers**:
  - Hardware/FPGA Acceleration (e.g., H1kari’s latest work)
  - Better filtering and imported host lists
  - New plugins (Metasploit, better captive portal detection, and avoidance)
  - Professional reporting (coming soon)
- **Logical Approach**:
  - Automated
  - Covers the whole toolset rather than one at a time
  - Parallelized attacks with multiple cards

### Wicrawl Overview
- **Goal-Oriented Wi-Fi Network Checks**:
  - Select checks based on plugins and profiles.
  - Get the info you want and avoid the cruft you don't care about.
- **Wicrawl**:
  - A simple Wi-Fi scanner and auditor with a flexible and simple plugin architecture.
  - Passive discovery and active crawling.
  - Power in the plugins.
  - Automation of standard tasks, association, DHCP, network checks, mapping, proxy-check, etc.
  - Multiple simultaneous Wi-Fi cards for parallel scanning/crawling.
  - Profiles determine when and how scanning is done.
  - Theme-able GTK GUI (with status bar for wardriving).
  - Extra features: GPSd, TTS, hooks for motorized antenna, reporting (PDF/HTML/XML/TXT).

### Wicrawl Examples
- **Basic Example**:
  - Discover APs
  - Associate
  - Get an IP address
  - Try to get to the Internet
  - Measure speed/latency
- **Advanced Example**:
  - Run nmap, Nessus
  - Trigger Metasploit
  - Try to break WEP/WPA-PSK
  - Bruteforce WEP dictionary attacks

### Under the Hood
- **Logical Pieces of Wicrawl**:
  - Discovery Engine
  - Plugin Engine
  - Plugins
  - Profiles
  - Reporting
  - UI(s)

### General Architecture
- **Discovery Engine**:
  - Similar to existing tools (e.g., Kismet, NetStumbler).
  - Passive discovery (Beacons and probes).
  - Requires monitor mode (rfmon).
  - Handles multiple radio header types.
  - Pcap traffic dumping.
  - Sends IPC messages to the plugin-engine directly.
  - Scheduled from the plugin-engine.
  - Written by Jason Spence and Focus.

- **Plugin Engine**:
  - Runs plugins based on the profile.
  - Multiple cards for distributed crawling.
  - Handles all scheduling decisions.
  - Written by Aaron Peterson.

- **Plugins**:
  - Super simple interface.
  - Executable (binary/script/etc.).
  - Two types: Scheduled and Hook.
  - Templates in Bash, Perl, Python, and even Fortran.
  - Wraps sometimes difficult-to-use tools.
  - Written by Aaron, Peter Kacherginsky, Focus, and you.

- **Workflow**:
  - In the UI, select the cards and profiles.
  - Start triggers plugin-engine to run discovery until plugin-scheduling takes over.
  - Run short-length plugins for 'new-ap' (first event level).
  - Continue escalating up the event levels until stuck.
  - Run through all other APs.
  - Second pass with medium run length.
  - Repeat in long run length if needed.

- **Existing Plugin Examples**:
  - Association, DHCP, Internet checks, NMAP, Aircrack-ng, Nessus, Bruteforcing, MAC spoofing, Metasploit, GPSD, Text to speech, and more.

- **Aircrack-ng Plugin**:
  - Starts monitor mode.
  - Gathers traffic (IVs).
  - Sends de-auth to broadcast and clients.
  - Uses --fakeauth for the client with the most packets.
  - Runs arp inject attacks to generate IVs.
  - Runs aircrack-ng once enough packets are gathered.

- **FPGAs and Hacking Faster**:
  - H1kari’s coWPAtty patches (part of open ciphers, openciphers.sf.net).
  - FPGA accelerated cracking.
  - Wicrawl plugin: checks for a 4-way handshake, runs tcpdump, and starts appropriate coWPAtty client.

- **Architecture: Plugins**:
  - Plugin writing example provided.

- **Profiles**:
  - Determine goals.
  - Card scheduling types.
  - Run lengths.
  - Persistent plugin path.
  - Plugin overrides.

- **Profile Examples**:
  - Pen-testing, Wardriving, Holding Internet Access.

- **UI(s)**:
  - **wicrawl-gtk**:
    - Sexy and configurable.
    - Runs plugin-engine.
    - Themes (think night-time).
    - Reads input from XML.
    - War-driving roll-up status bar.
    - Written by Peter Kacherginsky.
  - **Curses-based UI in alpha**:
    - For WRT54G (wifly).

- **Status**:
  - Full release.
  - Linux only this release.
  - BSD/Mac next targets.
  - Few bugs, some plugin cleanup.
  - Card support needs validation.
  - More plugins needed.
  - TUI testing/completion.
  - PDF professional reporting.
  - Metasploit & wesside plugins coming soon.

- **Future**:
  - Multiple computers.
  - Multi-Plexing APs.
  - Multiple card discovery.
  - Plugins, plugins, plugins.
  - Info registry.
  - Card capabilities database.
  - Plugin reporting formats.
  - Ultra-mega-AP-scanning behemoth.
  - Wicrack – Wi-fi distributed cracking flash mob.

- **Liability**:
  - Only you are responsible!
  - Sticky case-law and enforcement.
  - If unsure, only scan your own APs.
  - Use AP filters to restrict scanning and crawling.
  - Use non-invasive profiles when appropriate.
  - Pen-testers: ALWAYS GET PERMISSION, contracts, insurance, etc.
