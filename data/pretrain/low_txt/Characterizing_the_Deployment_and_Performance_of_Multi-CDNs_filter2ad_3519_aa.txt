## Abstract
Pushing software updates to millions of geographically diverse clients is a significant technical challenge for software providers. In this paper, we analyze the use of content delivery networks (CDNs) in delivering software updates for two major operating systems (Windows and iOS) over a three-year period. We utilize a dataset of DNS and ping measurements from 9,000 RIPE Atlas clients distributed across 206 countries to understand regional and temporal trends in the use of multiple CDNs for OS updates. We compare the methodologies used by Microsoft and Apple, where most Microsoft clients download updates from their local ISP, while 90% of Apple clients access updates from Apple's own network. Our findings show an approximate 70 ms improvement in latency for clients in Asia and Africa when accessing content from edge caches in local ISPs. Additionally, Microsoft provides lower latencies in developing regions by directing clients to Akamai’s extensive network of edge caches. However, clients in developing regions who access Windows updates via Level 3 experience poor latencies due to the lack of Level 3’s presence in those regions.

## Introduction
Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are employed by various content providers to facilitate low-latency access to clients globally. Deploying CDNs requires significant financial investment by content providers. With proprietary network measurement data and mapping heuristics, different CDNs present varying strengths and weaknesses in serving specific types of clients or geographic regions. To improve reliability and mitigate the risk of a single CDN failure, some organizations use multiple CDNs.

While the use of multiple CDNs has been known for nearly a decade, studies on their deployment have been limited. Content providers are often hesitant to publish performance data that may reflect poorly on their business partners. In this study, we take an alternate approach by analyzing end-to-end path latency observed by clients. Using data from a recent plenary at RIPE71, we focus on the multi-CDN infrastructure used by Apple and Microsoft for delivering OS updates.

We extend prior analysis of this dataset and develop methods to identify CDN edge caches and assign them to the appropriate CDN provider. This methodology allows us to perform one of the first large-scale and longitudinal analyses of multi-CDN deployments, focusing on:
1. The mix of CDN providers employed by content providers.
2. The performance of different CDN providers and in different regions.
3. The stability of replica mappings.
4. The impact of shifting between CDN providers for clients.

Our key observations include:
- Significant regional variations in client-side latency, with developed regions (e.g., North America and Europe) observing a median latency of 20 ms, while developing regions (e.g., Africa, Asia, South America) observe median latencies as high as 200 ms.
- A decline in latency in developing regions over the last two years, but with room for further improvement.
- Significant latency improvements in developing regions by accessing content from local edge caches, with clients in Africa seeing over a 10x reduction in latency.

## Background
Latency is a critical aspect of user experience on the Internet. Content providers like Google and Microsoft either partner with CDNs or develop their own solutions to bring content closer to users. CDNs typically use one of two approaches for mapping content servers to clients:
1. **DNS-based redirection:** CDNs redirect clients to the best edge server using DNS responses. While effective, it can fail if a single resolver serves a geographically diverse set of clients.
2. **Anycast-based redirection:** CDNs use anycast routing to direct clients to the nearest edge server. This approach is simple to deploy but lacks fine-grained control and can lead to overloading of edge servers.

## Methodology
### Data Collection
We leverage data collected over two years by approximately 9,000 RIPE Atlas nodes located in about 3,000 autonomous systems (ASes) worldwide. Data is collected by issuing ping measurements to domains used for hosting software updates: `download.windowsupdate.com` for Microsoft and `appdownload.itunes.apple.com` for Apple. Each probe resolves the domain name locally and performs 5 pings to the resolved IP address. For Microsoft, both IPv4 and IPv6 pings are performed every hour, while IPv4 pings are performed every 15 minutes for Apple.

### Data Normalization
Due to the skewed distribution of RIPE Atlas probes, we normalize the number of ping measurements analyzed from each AS. We experiment with two normalization techniques: sampling a fixed number of latency measurements from each network and sampling pings in proportion to the fraction of all Internet users in that network. Both techniques yield similar results, and we present the results of the latter technique.

### Identifying CDN Instances
To identify the organization (content provider or CDN) the client is being referred to, we use CAIDA’s AS to organization mapping (AS2Org) and perform regular expression-based searches on the name field. We also use reverse DNS lookups, WhatWeb scanning, and AS2Org mappings to identify CDN edge cache instances.

### Limitations
- **Geographical Bias:** The majority of RIPE Atlas probes are located in Europe, leading to a bias towards European performance. We mitigate this by analyzing performance on a per-continent basis.
- **Failed DNS Resolutions and Errors:** We exclude data points with failed DNS resolutions and other errors from our analysis.
- **Latency as an Approximation for Performance:** While we measure latency, content providers often optimize other parameters like throughput and stability.

## Characterizing Multi-CDNs
In this section, we describe the characteristics of multi-CDN deployments that serve content to Microsoft and Apple clients. We discuss the combination of CDN providers that serve OS updates to clients and compare their performance. We also analyze regional trends in latency, focusing on clients in developing regions like Asia, Africa, and South America.

### Regional Performance Trends
There are significant regional variations in client-side latency. Clients in developed regions (e.g., North America and Europe) observe a median latency of 20 ms, while clients in developing regions (e.g., Africa, Asia, South America) observe median latencies as high as 200 ms. Over the last two years, there has been a decline in latency in developing regions, but there is still room for improvement.

### Performance Impact of Edge Caches
Clients in developing regions observe significant latency improvements by accessing content from local edge caches. Specifically, clients in Africa see over a 10x reduction in latency by migrating to edge caches.

### Conclusion
Our study provides insights into the deployment and performance of multi-CDNs for delivering OS updates. We find that the use of local edge caches significantly improves latency for clients in developing regions. Future work could explore additional optimization strategies and the long-term impact of multi-CDN deployments on global content delivery.
