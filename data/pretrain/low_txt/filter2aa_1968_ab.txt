### Breach of Contract and Copyright Infringement Damages

Breach of contract damages are typically limited to the actual loss caused by the breach. (See 24 Richard A. Lord, Williston on Contracts § 65:1 (4th ed. 2007)). In contrast, copyright infringement damages can include the copyright owner’s actual damages and any additional profits of the infringer, or statutory damages up to $150,000 per infringed work. (17 U.S.C. § 504; see Frank Music Corp. v. MGM, Inc., 772 F.2d 505, 512 n.5 (9th Cir. 1985)). Courts may also impose injunctive relief, seize infringing articles, and award costs and attorneys’ fees. (17 U.S.C. §§ 502, 503, 505).

### Do Users of Glider Infringe Blizzard’s Copyright?

MDY does not dispute that Blizzard owns a valid copyright in the World of Warcraft (WoW) game client and game server software. MDY also acknowledges that the game client software, typically located on a player's hard drive, is copied to the computer's random access memory (RAM) when WoW is played. Ninth Circuit law holds that copying software to RAM constitutes "copying" under section 106 of the Copyright Act. (MAI Sys. Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc., 991 F.2d 511, 518-19 (9th Cir. 1993)). Therefore, if a person is not authorized by the copyright holder (through a license) or by law (through section 117, which will be discussed below) to copy the software to RAM, they are guilty of copyright infringement.

MDY argues that users of Glider do not infringe Blizzard’s copyright because they are licensed to copy the game client software to RAM. According to MDY, WoW players acquire this license when they purchase the game client software and load it onto their hard drives. MDY claims that contrary provisions in the End User License Agreement (EULA) and Terms of Use (TOU), such as prohibitions on the use of bots, are merely contractual terms, not limitations on the scope of the license. Thus, while Blizzard may assert a claim for breach of contract against Glider users, MDY contends that it cannot assert a more powerful claim of copyright infringement.

“Generally, a copyright owner who grants a nonexclusive license to use his copyrighted material waives his right to sue the licensee for copyright infringement and can sue only for breach of contract.” (Sun Microsystems, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 188 F.3d 1115, 1121 (9th Cir. 1999) (“Sun I”) (citations omitted)). “If, however, a license is limited in scope and the licensee acts outside the scope, the licensor can bring an action for copyright infringement.” (Id.). To prevail on a copyright infringement claim, a plaintiff who has granted a license must establish that the license terms are “limitations on the scope of the license rather than independent contractual covenants,” and that the defendant’s actions exceed the scope of the license. (Id. at 1122).

### Is the EULA Limited in Scope?

The use of WoW is governed by two agreements: the EULA and the TOU. Players must affirmatively consent to these agreements before playing WoW. The EULA states: “IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO INSTALL, COPY, OR USE THE GAME.” (Dkt. #42 at 2 (capitalization in original)). The next paragraph provides that any use, reproduction, modification, or distribution of the game client software not expressly authorized by the EULA is prohibited. (Id.).

Section 1 of the EULA specifically addresses the license granted by Blizzard:

**Grant of Limited Use License.** If you agree to this License Agreement, the game client software (hereafter referred to as the “Game Client”) will be installed on your hardware. If your hardware meets the minimum requirements, the installation of the Game Client will enable you to play the Game by accessing your account with the Service (your “Account”). Subject to your agreement to and continuing compliance with this License Agreement, Blizzard hereby grants, and you hereby accept, a limited, non-exclusive license to (a) install the Game Client on one or more computers owned by you or under your legitimate control, and (b) use the Game Client in conjunction with the Service for your non-commercial entertainment purposes only. All use of the Game Client is subject to this License Agreement and to the [TOU], both of which you must accept before you can use your Account to play the Game. (Id. at 3 (emphasis added)).

Several parts of this section are noteworthy. The title, “Grant of Limited Use License,” and the reference to a “limited, non-exclusive license” make it clear that the license is limited. The grant of the limited license is expressly made “[s]ubject to your agreement to and continuing compliance with this License Agreement.” The section further provides that all use of the Game Client is subject to the EULA and the TOU. Thus, the portion of the contract that grants a license to use the game client software also makes it clear that the license is limited.

### Are Key Provisions of the EULA and TOU Limitations on the Scope of the License or Separate Contractual Covenants?

Having determined that the Blizzard license is limited, the Court must construe the EULA and TOU to determine whether the provisions violated by the use of Glider are limitations on the scope of the license, which would mean that the users have infringed the copyright by acting outside the scope of the license, or whether the terms are merely separate contractual covenants, which would make this a contract dispute. (Sun I, 188 F.3d at 1119). Blizzard argues that Glider users violate portions of section 4 of the TOU (subsections 4(B)(ii) and 4(B)(iii)) and portions of section 5 (subsections 5(B)(6) and 5(B)(8)). (Dkt. #39 at 6-7). The Court will address these sections.

As an initial matter, the Court concludes that limitations on the license granted by Blizzard may be found in both the EULA and the TOU. Section 1 of the EULA, which grants the limited license, expressly states that users are subject to both the EULA and the TOU. (Dkt. #42 at 3). These contracts must therefore be read together. As already noted, both agreements must be accepted before a user can play WoW.

The EULA and TOU contain no provision that explicitly lays out the scope of the Blizzard limited license. However, the Court concludes that the limitations on scope are found in section 4 of the TOU. The provisions of section 4 generally are designed to preserve and protect Blizzard’s proprietary interests in its software and game, including its copyright interests. (Dkt. #41 at 4). Subsection A of section 4 prohibits users from intercepting, emulating, or redirecting the proprietary components of the game, activities that would include the exclusive copying and distribution rights possessed by Blizzard under section 106 of the Copyright Act. Subsection B prohibits users from modifying files that are part of the game, an activity akin to the creation of derivative works – another right possessed exclusively by Blizzard as the copyright holder. Subsection C prohibits users from disrupting the game or other players’ use of the game. Subsection D reserves Blizzard’s exclusive right under section 106 of the Act to create derivative works. (Id.).

The provisions of section 4 thus make clear that although users are licensed to play WoW and to use the game client software while playing, they are not licensed to exercise other rights belonging exclusively to Blizzard as the copyright holder – copying, distributing, or modifying the work. The provisions are limits on the scope of the license granted by Blizzard.

Section 5 of the TOU is different. It is titled “Rules of Conduct.” (Id. at 4). The subsections of section 5 are titled “Rules Related to Usernames and Guild Designations” (§ 5(A)), “Rules Related to ‘Chat’ and Interaction With Other Users” (§ 5(B)), and “Rules Related to Game Play” (§ 5(C)). Section 5 sets rules for the game, whereas section 4 establishes limits more clearly designed to preserve Blizzard’s copyright interests. The section 5 rules also regulate relatively minor matters such as the use of celebrity names (§ 5(A)(4)) or offensive language (§ 5(A)(2)) for WoW characters. Section 5 establishes game rules by contract.

When the EULA and TOU are considered in their entirety, the Court concludes that section 4 of the TOU establishes limitations on the scope of the license and section 5 sets rules of the game as independent contract terms. A single contract can clearly contain both types of provisions. (See Netbula, LLC v Storage Tech. Corp., No. C06-07391 MJJ, 2008 WL 228036, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 18, 2008) (concluding that one clause of an agreement was a contractual covenant while another clause was a limitation on the scope of the license)).

### Do Users of Glider Act Outside the Scope of the License?

Users of Glider clearly violate the prohibition in section 4(B)(ii) of the TOU against the use of “bots” or any “third-party software designed to modify the [WoW] experience[.]” (Dkt. #41-8 at 4). Players who use Glider to mine WoW for game assets also violate section 4(B)(iii). When WoW users employ Glider, they act outside the scope of the license delineated in section 4 of the TOU. Copying the game client software to RAM while engaged in this unauthorized activity constitutes copyright infringement. (See MAI, 991 F.2d at 518-19 (copying software to RAM constitutes “copying” for purposes of section 106 of the Copyright Act); Ticketmaster LLC v. RMG Techs., Inc., 507 F. Supp. 2d 1096, 1108 (C.D. Cal. 2007) (use of bot violated TOU and gave rise to copyright infringement)).

MDY relies on the Federal Circuit’s decision in Storage Technology Corp. v. Custom Hardware Engineering & Consulting, Inc., 421 F.3d 1307 (Fed. Cir. 2005), to argue that uses which violate a license constitute copyright infringement only when the uses themselves infringe one of the exclusive rights granted by the Copyright Act. (Dkt. #57 at 6-7). The Court is not convinced that Storage Technology should be read so narrowly. It is obvious that a person cannot be liable for copyright infringement without committing an act of infringement. Thus, where a license is at issue, the person must not only act outside the scope of the license but must also engage in an act that infringes upon the exclusive rights granted the copyright holder by section 106 of the Act. This much is clear from both Ninth Circuit law and Storage Technology. However, to the extent MDY suggests that the act that causes the person to fall outside the scope of the license and the act that constitutes copyright infringement must be one and the same, MDY has cited no Ninth Circuit authority.
