### NATting Else Matters: Evaluating IPv6 Access Control Policies

#### 4. Results

In this section, we present the results of our experiments for each of the consumer edge (CE) routers. Our findings indicate that CE routers with IPv6 capability exhibit little commonality in security implementation across different manufacturers.

##### 4.1 Operational Defaults

Table 1 provides an overview of our findings, highlighting a wide variance in default operation, security, and user control. Out of the ten routers assessed, eight have an enabled default firewall policy (i.e., default-deny) for IPv6. The remaining two devices, TP-Link AC1750 and Motorola MR2600, do not have a default firewall (i.e., default-permit). Neither of these two devices communicates this design decision to the consumer. Notably, the TP-Link AC1750 is Amazon US’s top-selling router [1] and TP-Link is the leading global provider, accounting for 15.9% of all deployed devices [10]. This suggests that the default permit model may be widely deployed.

Among the eight routers with a default deny policy, five offer a "One-Click Open" option, which immediately transitions the network to a default permit model, allowing all inbound traffic through to the internal hosts. The impact of this feature on ingress filtering is illustrated in Figure 3 in the Appendix. Only one of the ten devices evaluated provides an explicit warning to the user before disabling the firewall using this feature. Users with minimal technical knowledge, who are accustomed to a default closed model from IPv4 NAT, may be unaware of the additional exposure this option creates.

Two routers, the Motorola MR2600 and TP-Link AC1750, enable IPv6 routing by default with a default permit firewall. This configuration exposes all IPv6-capable devices to the wider Internet by default. While the Motorola MR2600 allows consumers to optionally enable the firewall, the user must be aware of the current state and possess the technical capability to do so. In contrast, the TP-Link router only provides the ability to disable IPv6 and has no capability to enable any filtering.

##### 4.2 Firewall Policies and Pinholing

We observed a range of firewall management options offered to consumers, from subscription-based services for packet inspection and filtering, to simple on/off toggles, to a complete lack of firewall configuration for IPv6. Depending on the router, modifying the configuration can be done through a smartphone application or a locally hosted web portal, with some devices supporting both.

**Responsible Disclosure:**
Given the severity of enabling IPv6 support by default and a default-permit posture, we disclosed our findings to both Motorola and TP-Link in August 2020. In November 2020, Motorola issued a public patch to correct the issue. TP-Link did not respond to our disclosure.

For routers that provide an interface to create exceptions to the default firewall filtering policy (pinholes), we found that two out of six connect those rules to the device MAC address. We verified that in these cases, traffic destined for any associated address for the device is forwarded. The other four out of six routers allow users to provide a single, static address that the rule applies to; the rules are not updated if the device migrates or is assigned additional IPv6 addresses over time.

Of the routers that do not support IPv6 pinholing, only the TP-Link AC1750 provides no ability to configure the firewall aside from disabling IPv6 (since it does not have such a firewall). For the remaining three routers, the Cisco DPC3941T XB3 also provides several options for choosing what kind of traffic is blocked, besides the "One-Click Open" option. For Ubiquiti AmpliFi and Netgear Nighthawk, "One-Click Open" is the only method available for users to control the firewall. As an example, the Ubiquiti AmpliFi provides users with minimal control over IPv4 policies through port-forwarding controls, but the management interface lacks an equivalent ability to create pinholes in IPv6. Ubiquiti notes this on their official FAQ: “AmpliFi does not support editing firewall configurations, and cannot be disabled unless you place the router in bridge mode” [15]. Contrary to this statement, they do allow automated modification of firewall rules through the embedded UPnP WANIPv6FirewallControl:1 device template. For manual control, the web interface instead offers an "Allow all incoming IPv6 connections" as the only actionable solution for non-technical users.

##### 4.3 Router Scanning

Our findings indicate that when CE routers are globally accessible, a majority of them expose open services to the Internet, as shown in Table 2. Whether the firewalls are disabled manually or by default, six routers do not employ rules to restrict access to local network services from the global Internet. We found that services (e.g., SMTP, HTTP, and SMB) available on internal router interfaces were also offered on the external interfaces and the link-local address on these devices. This indicates that manufacturers are configuring their internal services to listen on all interfaces; when the firewall is off, these services become accessible from the Internet.
