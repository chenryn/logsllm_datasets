### Mechanisms to be Developed with Churn as a Primary Concern

Our work aims to contribute to the development of realistic churn assumptions for the creation of distributed social network-based solutions.

### 3. MEASUREMENTS AND ANALYSIS

Instant messaging systems like Skype [1] and Yahoo! Instant Messenger [6] are used by millions of users every day. These systems can be viewed as distributed social networks, where a typical user installs a client on their device and adds friends and acquaintances as 'contacts' to interact with them. Unlike online social networks (OSNs) such as Facebook and LinkedIn, these systems generally do not allow users to access friends of their friends, limiting each user's knowledge of their extended network. This setting provides a natural environment to motivate design considerations for distributed social network-based approaches. In this section, we examine some of the dynamics observed in such systems, which can help in building more realistic and robust distributed social network-based systems.

#### 3.1 Skype

While much of the research on churn in distributed systems was conducted in the previous decade, we argue that churn remains an important factor in today's distributed systems. To illustrate this, we analyze the uptime behavior in one of the world's largest and most popular instant messaging systems: Skype [1].

We collected data from an RSS feed on the Skype website [3], which provided the total number of concurrent Skype users online at 5-minute intervals over a 7-month period from February 6, 2014, to August 18, 2014. Figure 2 shows each data point during this period, with all times displayed in Central European Time (CET).

We observe the expected diurnal pattern of online users, with the highest concurrency during the early evening and the lowest in the early morning. For example, on July 21, 2014, the number of concurrent users started at 58 million at midnight, dipped to the lowest of the day at 55 million at 4 AM, and then gradually increased to a peak of 81 million at 6 PM. The number of concurrent users then decreased to 61 million at midnight the next day. The highest and lowest concurrency at 6 PM and 4 AM CET coincide with 12 PM and 10 PM Eastern Time (ET) and 9 AM and 7 PM Pacific Time (PT) in the United States, which explains the day/night online behavior of users.

There is also a weekly pattern, with the number of concurrent users peaking on Monday and gradually decreasing through the week until Saturday. Interestingly, Sunday is not the least active day, possibly because Saturday, rather than Sunday, is the most common weekend day across various countries. During a week, we observe a minimum-maximum range of 32-58 million and 47-82 million users online before and after mid-June 2014, respectively. The week of June 10 saw an increase of nearly 25 million concurrent users, which may be attributed to factors such as the World Cup and/or the release of a new version of Skype for iPhone [2]. However, the concurrent usage has since followed a steady pattern.

According to Microsoft's internal data [4], there were approximately 240, 300, and 330 million active users per month in 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively. Extrapolating these figures, we can infer the overall growth and stability of the user base.

**Notes:**
- This dataset will be made available upon request.
- Since September 2014, the RSS feed [3] has been discontinued. Additionally, Skype clients no longer display the number of concurrent users online.
