### Mission-Support Network to Operational Network

The mission-support network is connected to the operational network, where real-time surveillance, communications, and flight information are processed to separate aircraft. This connection, as shown in Figure 1, poses a potential risk for cyber threats.

- **Infrastructure Overview:** The infrastructure primarily consists of the backbone FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure (FTI) and several local area networks. The FAA relies on this infrastructure to conduct Air Traffic Control (ATC) operations.

### Recent Cybersecurity Incidents

In recent years, significant amounts of U.S. Government (including the Department of Transportation) and commercial data have been "exfiltrated" to foreign domains on the Internet. This has led to a comprehensive effort by the Office of Management and Budget to strengthen government-wide cybersecurity.

### Security Risks Due to Network Connections

The risk of cyber attacks is heightened due to the network connections—both authorized (e.g., system maintenance) and unauthorized (e.g., inadequate network setup)—between the FAA's mission-support and ATC systems. Some notable security-related events include:

- **FY 2006:** The Remote Maintenance Monitoring System was connected to the less-secure mission-support network, creating a security exposure to ATC operations.
- **FY 2006:** A viral attack originating from the Internet spread from administrative networks to ATC systems, forcing the FAA to shut down a portion of its ATC systems in Alaska.
- **FY 2008:** Hackers took over FAA computers in Alaska, becoming "insiders." They later stole the enterprise administrator’s password in Oklahoma, installed malicious codes, and compromised the domain controller in the Western Pacific Region, gaining access to over 40,000 FAA user IDs, passwords, and other sensitive information.
- **FY 2009:** Hackers compromised an FAA public-facing Web application computer on the Internet and used it to enter an internal database server, exposing personal identifiable information (PII) of 48,000 current and former FAA employees.

These vulnerabilities occurred because:
1. Web applications were not adequately configured to prevent unauthorized access.
2. Known vulnerabilities in Web application software were not corrected in a timely manner with available security patches.

### Inadequate Intrusion-Detection Capabilities

The ATC IP-based network infrastructure, consisting of the backbone FTI wide-area network and numerous local area networks within ATC facilities, is monitored by an FAA contractor. The DOT’s Cyber Security Management Center (CSMC) monitors cyber incidents at the facility level. However, the intrusion-detection capability is ineffective due to:

- **Insufficient IDS Sensor Deployment:** IDS sensors are deployed only at 11 out of hundreds of ATC facilities, providing monitoring coverage only for mission-support systems, not for ATC operational systems.
- **Lack of Timely Remediation:** During FY 2008, ATO received 877 cyber-incident alerts from CSMC, but 151 incidents (17%) remained unresolved by the end of the fiscal year. Fifty of these had been open for more than three months.

### Recommendations

We recommend that the Acting Federal Aviation Administrator direct the FAA’s Chief Information Officer and ATO’s Chief Operating Officer to:

1. Ensure all Web applications used in ATC systems comply with government security standards.
2. Strengthen the patch management process by identifying and promptly installing security patches for Web applications with known vulnerabilities.
3. Take immediate action to correct high-risk vulnerabilities and establish a timetable for remediation of all remaining vulnerabilities.
4. Resolve differences with CSMC and establish a timetable for deploying IDS monitoring devices covering local area networks at all ATC facilities.
5. In conjunction with CSMC officials, identify the information needed for remediation and establish procedures to ensure timely remediation of cyber incidents based on their criticality.

### Agency Comments and OIG Response

FAA concurred with all recommendations and recognized the need for constant vigilance and effective action in addressing cyber security in ATC systems. FAA also acknowledged the importance of separating the network infrastructure between the National Airspace System (NAS) and FAA administrative/ATC mission-support systems. 

### Actions Taken and Planned

FAA’s actions taken and planned are responsive to our recommendations and are considered resolved. These actions are subject to follow-up provisions in Department of Transportation Order 8000.1C.

### Scope and Methodology

This audit was conducted by KPMG of Washington, D.C., under contract to DOT OIG, and by OIG staff. The audit was conducted at FAA Headquarters, CSMC, selected FAA facilities, and the FTI operational center in Melbourne, Florida. OIG staff performed an Internet search and reviewed the ATO Risk Assessment Process Site Survey Plan, generating lists of Web applications used to support ATC operations. These lists served as a basis for KPMG’s external and internal vulnerability assessment/penetration tests. OIG staff also analyzed significant cyber incidents identified during the audit.
