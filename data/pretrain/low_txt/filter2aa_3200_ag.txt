#### Current Interoperable Communications Initiatives
- In 1994, Michigan began constructing an all-weather digital statewide interoperable two-way mobile radio communication system for use by Michigan's public safety community, known as the Michigan Public Safety Communication System (MPSCS).
- MPSCS operates in the 821 MHz radio frequency band dedicated to public safety communication and is supported by a microwave backbone that controls traffic and supports a sophisticated alarm and control system.
- MPSCS has the ability to integrate with other 800 MHz Motorola systems, expanding its capacity within the state and supporting data sharing.
- Today, over 33,000 radios representing 800 agencies utilize MPSCS.
