### Exemption for Telecommunications Service Providers to Public and Private Sector Organizations

There is an exemption for telecommunications service providers to public and private sector organizations. However, it remains unclear whether these organizations would qualify as telecommunications service providers under criminal law. Consequently, organizations may not be able to rely on this exemption. Anti-terrorism legislation significantly complicates the task of protecting the privacy of network communications and the personal information they contain. Not only can a broader range of information be intercepted under authorization, but a similarly broad range of information must be retained by ISPs and telephone companies. Additionally, there appears to have been a reduction in the level of judicial discretion in granting or denying interception requests.

### Addressing Deficiencies: A New Exemption Under Criminal Law

It is reasonable to suggest that addressing these deficiencies requires the creation of a new exemption under criminal law. This exemption would provide the necessary legal basis for intercepting private communications to protect public and private sector computer systems or networks from mischief, unauthorized use, or interference.

### Developing a Legal Framework for Intrusion Detection

A significant amount of work is still needed to develop a general legal framework for conducting intrusion detection within the public and private sectors. Once this legal framework is established, additional efforts will be required to develop appropriate policies, standards, and procedures for the use of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). This includes determining what information can be collected, how that information should be handled, stored, or disposed of, and who has access to the information under what circumstances. The assistance of the legal community would be invaluable in this endeavor.
