### A. Structure's Equation of Motion

We can model the frame shown in Fig. 30a as the simple, dynamically equivalent model shown in Fig. 30b. In this model:
- The lateral stiffness of the columns is modeled by the spring \( k \).
- The damping is modeled by the shock absorber \( c \).
- The mass of the floor is modeled by the mass \( m \).

Figure 30c shows the free body diagram of the structure. The forces include:
- Spring force \( f_s(t) \)
- Damping force \( f_d(t) \)
- External dynamic load on the structure \( p(t) \)
- Inertial force \( f_i(t) \)

These forces are defined as:
\[
f_s = k q(t)
\]
\[
f_d = c \dot{q}(t)
\]
\[
f_i = m \ddot{q}(t)
\]
where:
- \( \dot{q}(t) \) is the first derivative of the displacement with respect to time (velocity).
- \( \ddot{q}(t) \) is the second derivative of the displacement with respect to time (acceleration).

Summing the forces shown in Figs. 30b and c, we obtain the following equation of motion:
\[
m \ddot{q}(t) = p(t) - c \dot{q}(t) - k q(t)
\]

Translating this concept to a multiple degree of freedom system and its equivalent dynamic model (Fig. 31) with \( n \)-degrees of freedom subjected to \( m_1 \) external excitations and \( m_2 \) controlling devices, we obtain the following expression:
\[
M \ddot{q}(t) + C \dot{q}(t) + K q(t) = T_u u(t) + T_p p(t)
\]
where:
- \( q(t) \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times 1} \) is the displacement vector relative to the ground.
- \( M, C, K \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} \) are the mass, damping, and stiffness matrices, respectively.
- \( u(t) \in \mathbb{R}^{m_2 \times 1} \) is the control force vector.
- \( T_u \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m_2} \) and \( T_p \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m_1} \) are the control and excitation location matrices, respectively.

In terms of calculating the inter-story drift (ISD):
- The displacement is shown in Fig. 31.
- The inter-story drift is determined by \( \Delta_2 = (q_2 - q_1) \).
- The inter-story drift ratio is computed as \( \Delta_r^2 = \frac{(q_2 - q_1)}{h_2} \) and \( \Delta_r^1 = \frac{q_1}{h_1} \).

In the case of a building subjected to seismic loading, the spatial load pattern vector \( T_p \) is equal to \( -M \bar{I}_{n \times 1} \ddot{q}_g(t) \), where the external excitation \( \ddot{q}_g(t) \) is the ground acceleration time history. For more details on the mathematical derivation of buildings equipped with control devices, refer to Chen et al. [14] and Connor and Laflamme [21].

### B. Model of Quanser’s Bench-Scale Testbed

The state variables that define the mathematical representation of the structure according to Equation (1) are chosen to be:
1. The position of the moving cart at story 1, \( x_{c1} \).
2. The position of the moving cart of floor 2, \( x_{c2} \).
3. Displacement at story 1, \( x_{f1} \).
4. Displacement at story 2, \( x_{f2} \).
5. Velocity of cart 1, \( \dot{x}_{c1} \).
6. Velocity of cart 2, \( \dot{x}_{c2} \).
7. Velocity of story 1 relative to the ground, \( \dot{x}_{f1} \).
8. Velocity of story 2 relative to the ground, \( \dot{x}_{f2} \).

These are the variables that provide information about the state of the structure. The output vector \( z \) corresponds to the inter-story drifts:
\[
\Delta x_{f1} = x_{f1}
\]
\[
\Delta x_{f2} = x_{f2} - x_{f1}
\]

The state-space vector of the plant is given by:
\[
x = \begin{pmatrix}
x_{c1} \\
x_{c2} \\
x_{f1} \\
x_{f2} \\
\dot{x}_{c1} \\
\dot{x}_{c2} \\
\dot{x}_{f1} \\
\dot{x}_{f2}
\end{pmatrix}
\]

The parameters of the state-space representation of the structure in Equation (1) are:
\[
A = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
-66.41 & 66.41 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
87.61 & 87.60 & 66.41 & -140.89 & -43.73 & 30.09 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 2.64 & 30.09 & -43.73 & 0 & 2.64 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\]
