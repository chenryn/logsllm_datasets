### Analysis of Block Withholding Attacks in Bitcoin Mining Pools

#### Miner's Dilemma and Pool Competition
When considering only sabotage attacks, there are regions where no-attack is the optimal strategy. In such scenarios, the miner's dilemma does not manifest. However, pool competition for miners can serve as an incentive for mutual attacks. A pool may choose to perform block withholding even if its revenue would increase only after the next difficulty adjustment. These two models are complementary, and a combined analysis is an area for future research.

#### Pool Fees
In our analysis, we assumed that pools do not charge fees from their members, as these fees are typically nominal (0–3% of a pool’s revenue [39]). The model can be extended to include pool fees, which would introduce a friction element to the flow of revenue among infiltrated and infiltrating pools. Specifically, Equation 4 would be modified to account for a pool fee \( f \):

\[
R_i(t) = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{m_i} x_{i,j}(t)(1 - f)r_j(t) + \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_{j,i}(t)r_i(t)}{1}
\]

A pool with a fee \( f \) is less attractive for block withholding because the attacker’s revenue is reduced by \( f \). However, it is also less attractive for miners in general. Balancing these factors for optimal protection is an area for future work, as part of the treatment of the miner-pool interplay.

### Related Work

#### The Block Withholding Attack
The threat of a block withholding attack has been known since the inception of Bitcoin pools. Rosenfeld [10] described this attack as early as 2011, as pools were becoming dominant in the Bitcoin ecosystem. The paper outlined the standard attack, where a miner sabotages a pool at the cost of reducing its own revenue. Adam Back [40] discussed fairness in proof-of-work schemes in 2002, in the context of the HashCash system [41]. Early work did not address the possibility of pools infiltrating other pools for block withholding.

In concurrent work, Luu et al. [35] experimentally demonstrated that block withholding can increase the attacker’s revenue. They did not address the question of mutual attacks. Courtois and Bahack [42] noted that a pool can increase its overall revenue with block withholding if all other mining is performed by honest pools. We consider the general case where not all mining is performed through public pools and analyze situations where pools can attack one another. The discrepancy between the calculations in [42] and our results for the special case analyzed there can be explained by the strong approximations in that work. For example, we calculate exactly how infiltrating miners reduce the revenue density of the infiltrated pool.

#### Temporary Block Withholding
In the block withholding attack discussed here, the withheld blocks are never published. However, blocks can be temporarily withheld, contrary to the Bitcoin protocol, to improve an attacker’s revenue. A miner or a pool can perform a selfish mining attack [23], where the attacker increases its revenue by temporarily withholding its blocks and publishing them in response to block publication by other pools and miners. This attack is independent of the block withholding attack we discuss and can be performed concurrently.

An attacker can also perform a double-spending attack [10] by intentionally generating two conflicting transactions, placing one in a block it withholds, and publishing the other transaction. After the recipient sees the published transaction, the attacker publishes the withheld block to revoke the former transaction. This attack is performed by miners or pools against service providers that accept Bitcoin and is not directly related to this work.

#### Block Withholding Defense
Most cryptocurrencies use a proof-of-work architecture similar to Bitcoin, where finding proof of work is the result of solution guessing and checking. All the algorithms we are aware of are susceptible to the block withholding attack, as miners can distinguish between partial and full proofs of work. Prominent examples include Litecoin [5], Dogecoin [6], and Permacoin [7].

It is possible to use an alternative proof-of-work mechanism where miners cannot distinguish between partial and full proofs of work [40, 10, 43]. Such a solution could reduce or eliminate the danger of block withholding. However, making such a change may not be in the community's interest: the potential for pool block withholding could lead to a reduction in pool sizes, as explained in Section IX-A.

#### Decentralized Pools
Although most pools use a centralized manager, a notable exception is P2Pool, a distributed pool architecture with no central manager [19]. Whether a pool is run by a centralized manager or a decentralized architecture is almost immaterial for the attack we describe. An open P2Pool group can be infiltrated and attacked, and the P2Pool code can be modified to support attacks against other pools.

On the other hand, P2Pool can be used by groups of miners to form closed pools that do not accept untrusted miners, thereby protecting against block withholding.

### Conclusion
We explored a block withholding attack among Bitcoin mining pools, an attack that is possible in any similar system that rewards proof of work. Such systems are gaining popularity, running most digital currencies and related services.

We observe that a no-pool-attacks scenario is not a Nash equilibrium: if none of the other pools attack, a pool can increase its revenue by attacking the others. When two pools can attack each other, they face a version of the Prisoner’s Dilemma. If one pool chooses to attack, the victim’s revenue is reduced, and it can retaliate by attacking and increasing its revenue. However, when both attack, at Nash equilibrium, both earn less than they would have if neither attacked. With multiple pools of equal size, a similar situation arises with a symmetric equilibrium.

The fact that block withholding is not common may be explained by modeling the attack decisions as an iterative prisoner’s dilemma. However, we argue that the situation is unstable since the attack can be done anonymously. Eventually, one pool may decide to increase its revenue and drag the others into attacking, resulting in reduced revenue for all. The inferior revenue would push miners to join private pools, which can verify that their registered miners do not withhold blocks. This would lead to smaller pools, ultimately creating a better environment for Bitcoin as a whole.
