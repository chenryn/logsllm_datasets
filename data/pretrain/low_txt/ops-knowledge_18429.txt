To configure Remote Desktop Services on a Windows server and allow external users to connect, follow these detailed steps:

1. **Enable Remote Desktop Services:**
   - Right-click the "This PC" or "Computer" icon on the desktop or in File Explorer, then select "Properties."
   - In the System Properties window, click on the "Remote settings" link.
   - Under the "Remote" tab, within the "Remote Desktop" section, check the option "Allow remote connections to this computer." You may also choose to allow connections only from computers running Remote Desktop with Network Level Authentication (NLA) for added security.
   - Click "Apply," then "OK" to save your changes.

2. **Configure Windows Firewall:**
   - To ensure that the Windows Firewall allows Remote Desktop connections, open the Control Panel and navigate to "System and Security > Windows Defender Firewall > Advanced settings."
   - In the Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security, under "Inbound Rules," click on "New Rule..." from the Actions panel on the right.
   - Choose "Port" as the rule type and click "Next."
   - Specify TCP and enter port 3389 (the default port used by RDP), then proceed to the next step.
   - Select "Allow the connection" and continue.
   - Apply the rule to Domain, Private, and/or Public profiles based on your network setup, then give the rule a name (e.g., "RDP Access") and finish creating the rule.

3. **Router Configuration:**
   - Log into your router's configuration interface using a web browser and the router’s IP address (often found in the router documentation or through command `ipconfig`).
   - Set up a port forwarding rule to forward external requests on port 3389 to the internal IP address of your Windows server. This can usually be done under sections like "Port Forwarding," "Virtual Servers," or similar, depending on your router model.
   - Ensure you have a static IP assigned to your server or use DHCP reservation so its IP doesn’t change, maintaining consistent connectivity.

4. **Connecting via Remote Desktop:**
   - On the client machine, launch the Remote Desktop Connection application (can be accessed via Start Menu search or Run dialog with `mstsc`).
   - Enter the public IP address of your network (or domain name if configured) and click "Connect."
   - Provide the required credentials (username and password) for an account on the target server when prompted. If NLA is enabled, you will need to authenticate before the session starts fully.

By following these instructions, you should be able to successfully set up and utilize Remote Desktop Services on a Windows server for external access.
