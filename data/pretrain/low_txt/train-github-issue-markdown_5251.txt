When using version 0.209.0 of Atom on Windows 7 Pro 64-bit, the application no longer opens a new window with the session state (including open folders and files) from the previously closed Atom window, even in safe mode. 

This issue is similar to #6917, which was previously resolved. I suspect this might be a regression, although it could also be a deliberate change. I have not found any mention of this behavior in the issue tracker, changelog, or release notes.

To the best of my knowledge, version 0.208.0 did restore the previous session. The last version that did not restore the previous session was around 0.197.0, but I am not entirely sure. In earlier versions, using "File / Exit" seemed to allow session restoration, while closing the window via the close button did not. Now, neither method appears to restore the previous session. Additionally, "File / Close Window" does not currently work, though I had not closely examined this feature in previous versions.
