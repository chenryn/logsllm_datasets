# Robust Protection for AES-128 in FPGA Implementations

## Abstract
This paper discusses the implementation and evaluation of robust error detection codes for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-128) on a Xilinx XCV1000E FPGA. The proposed robust cubic signatures provide enhanced error coverage with minimal hardware overhead, making them suitable for applications requiring high fault tolerance, such as smart cards.

## 1. Introduction
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is widely used for secure data encryption. However, it is vulnerable to fault injection attacks, which can compromise the security of the system. This paper presents a robust protection scheme using cubic signatures to improve the error detection capabilities of AES-128 implementations on FPGAs.

## 2. Background
### 2.1 Fault Injection Attacks
Fault injection attacks, such as Differential Fault Analysis (DFA), exploit the physical vulnerabilities of cryptographic devices to induce errors and extract secret keys. These attacks are particularly effective against linear error detection schemes.

### 2.2 Robust Codes
Robust codes, such as cubic signatures, offer better error detection by introducing nonlinearity into the error detection process. This nonlinearity significantly reduces the number of undetectable errors compared to linear codes.

## 3. Implementation
### 3.1 FPGA Design
We implemented AES-128 on a Xilinx XCV1000E FPGA using Xilinx Foundation tools. The design includes dynamic key expansion for both encryption and decryption, controlled by a simple control unit.

### 3.2 Robust Cubic Signatures
The AES-128 design was protected using robust cubic signatures with different lengths (r). The overheads for various values of r are summarized in Table 2. The complexity of the cubic network does not increase uniformly with r, as shown in Table 2. For example, r=24 and r=28 exhibit lower complexity due to the choice of primitive polynomials.

### 3.3 Component Sizes
Table 3 provides the relative sizes of the components in the design when r=28. The AES encryption/decryption core, key expansion, control unit, and 28-bit cube are detailed, showing the distribution of slices and their relative sizes.

## 4. Simulation Results
### 4.1 Symmetrical Errors
Symmetrical errors were injected into the extended 156-bit output of the device. The results, presented in Table 4, show that the robust cubic protection missed no errors, while the linear protection missed 118 errors out of 29.7 billion patterns.

### 4.2 Unidirectional Errors
Unidirectional errors (1 to 0 only) were also injected. The results, shown in Table 5, indicate that the robust cubic protection missed no errors, while the linear protection missed 160 errors out of 12.2 billion patterns.

### 4.3 Errors Missed by Linear Architecture
Errors missed by the linear architecture were simulated by generating 128-bit errors in information bits and 28 redundant error pattern bits. The results, presented in Table 6, show that the robust cubic protection significantly reduces the number of undetectable errors.

## 5. Advantages and Future Work
### 5.1 Advantages
- **Enhanced Error Coverage**: Robust cubic signatures provide better error detection with minimal hardware overhead.
- **Low Overhead**: The robust design with r=28 adds only 75% overhead over the unprotected AES.
- **Improved Security**: The nonlinear nature of the cubic signatures makes it difficult for attackers to inject undetectable errors.

### 5.2 Future Work
Future research will focus on combining protection against fault injection with countermeasures against power and timing analysis attacks. We will explore self-timed circuits and dual-rail logic to further enhance the security of AES implementations.

## 6. Conclusion
The proposed robust cubic signatures provide a significant improvement in error detection for AES-128 implementations on FPGAs. The enhanced error coverage and low hardware overhead make this approach suitable for high-security applications, such as smart cards.
