**Abstract:**
This study aims to investigate the prevalence, causes, and impact of congestion on the African Internet Exchange Point (IXP) substrate. We deployed Ark probes at six African IXPs and used the time-sequence latency probe (TSLP) algorithm to collect latency measurements over a year. Our analysis detected congestion events and quantified their duration and magnitude at four IXPs. Interviews with IXP operators helped us verify and understand the causes of these events. Our results show that only 2.2% of the discovered IP links experienced sustained or transient congestion during our measurement period. These findings highlight the need for ISPs to carefully monitor and manage their peering links to avoid or quickly mitigate congestion. Regulators may also consider defining maximum permissible levels of packet loss to ensure reliable communication through local IXPs.

**1. Introduction**
The increasing popularity of bandwidth-intensive applications, such as streaming video, has renewed interest in understanding the nature, location, and causes of performance degradations in the Internet infrastructure. Previous studies in the US and Europe have found that congestion often occurs at network boundaries due to disputes over infrastructure upgrades [16, 28]. However, little is known about congestion and its causes at IXPs, especially in developing regions like Africa. IXPs are critical hubs for traffic exchange between hundreds of networks, and promoting peering at African IXPs is a growing trend [2, 13, 14, 25]. Quantifying the performance at these infrastructures is essential to address the concerns of ISPs hesitant to join local IXPs and to identify and mitigate performance issues.

To fill this gap, we selected six IXPs in three African sub-regions (West, East, and Southern Africa) and deployed Ark probes to conduct continuous, fine-grained, and longitudinal measurements. Using TSLP, we collected latency data from February 2016 to April 2017, inferring congestion on discovered links. We evaluated the impact of congestion on round-trip times (RTTs) and packet loss, and interviewed IXP operators to understand the root causes. Our results show that while only 2.2% of the measured links experienced congestion, there is a need for ISPs to monitor and manage their peering links. Regulators could also define maximum permissible levels of packet loss to improve performance and make local IXPs attractive for interconnection.

**2. Related Work**
Chetty et al. [11] measured broadband performance in South Africa, finding that users do not receive advertised speeds, and interconnection issues significantly affect reliability and performance. Gupta et al. [18] observed that 66.8% of paths from their vantage points to Google caches detoured through Europe. Fanou et al. [13] highlighted the reliance on external ISPs for intra-continental traffic, detected new IXPs, and showed the positive impact of local peering on AS path lengths and delays. Chavula et al. [22] found that 75% of paths among African research networks were routed via Europe and the US, increasing RTTs by 150 ms on average. More recently, Fanou et al. [14] conducted a longitudinal study of connectivity among local African networks, highlighting the dominance of intercontinental ASes and the improvements in QoS from increased peering.

**3. Measurement Infrastructure**
The TSLP method [28] involves frequent RTT measurements from a vantage point (VP) within a network to the near and far routers of an interdomain link. If the link is congested, the buffer occupancy increases, leading to higher RTTs. This technique allows a VP to monitor congestion without explicit cooperation from the network operator. We used the CAIDA Archipelago (Ark) platform [9] for fine-grained measurements, deploying probes at six African IXPs: GIXA (Ghana), JINX (South Africa), KIXP (Kenya), SIXP (Gambia), and TIX (Tanzania). These IXPs are mature and large, making them ideal for analyzing a large number of peering links. VPs were deployed in two settings: some in the content network of the IXP, and others hosted by ASes peering at the IXPs.

**4. Data Collection**
We used CAIDA’s border mapping tool bdrmap [10, 29] to infer the host networks’ boundaries and discover their border links. The input datasets included prefix-AS mappings, AS-rank algorithm, RIR delegation files, IXP prefixes from PeeringDB and PCH, and sibling AS lists. bdrmap uses traceroute and alias resolution techniques to infer interdomain links. We validated the bdrmap output against public datasets and received feedback from four out of six VP hosts. On average, 96.2% of the neighbors of the VP networks were correctly discovered. We then probed both ends of each discovered IP link every 5 minutes using TTL-limited probes. For ethical considerations, we used a low probing rate and ensured that the targets did not put the Ark probe hosts at risk. We ran our measurements from February 2016 to March 2017 and set up additional loss rate measurements for links showing repeated congestion.

**5. Data Analysis**
**5.1 Evolution of Number of Discovered Links**
We categorized the links discovered from each VP as those established at the IXPs. We validated the bdrmap output with IXP operators and inspected the evolution of the number of neighbors of the VP’s AS over time. We also geolocated both IPs of each link using the Netacuity Edge Database [12] and Reverse DNS outputs [19, 34].

**5.2 Analysis of Congestion Cases**
We analyzed the RTT time series collected per VP and discovered neighbor, applying an algorithm to detect level shifts indicating router queue filling. The algorithm uses the CUSUM test [40] to identify changes, tuned to use 5-minute latency samples and detect level shifts lasting at least 30 minutes. We imposed a threshold of 10 ms to eliminate false detections. We conducted a sensitivity analysis, comparing thresholds of 5 ms, 15 ms, and 20 ms. Using a 10 ms threshold, we flagged 11.2% more links as potentially congested compared to 5 ms, but the number of links with recurring diurnal patterns remained the same. A 15 ms or 20 ms threshold flagged 50% fewer links with recurring patterns. We confirmed with IXP operators that 10 ms was a reasonable threshold.

| VP2  | X     | Y     | Z     | W     |
| VP3  | X     | Y     | Z     | W     |
| VP4  | X     | Y     | Z     | W     |
| VP5  | X     | Y     | Z     | W     |
| VP6  | X     | Y     | Z     | W     |
| All  | X     | Y     | Z     | W     |

**Conclusion and Future Work**
Our study provides insights into the prevalence and causes of congestion at African IXPs. While only a small percentage of links experienced congestion, the findings underscore the importance of monitoring and managing peering links. Future work will focus on expanding the study to include more IXPs and further investigating the root causes of congestion.
