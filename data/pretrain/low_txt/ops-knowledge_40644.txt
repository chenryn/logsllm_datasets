I currently know Ruby, but I am interested in learning a new programming language. I am currently using Ubuntu 10.04, but I plan to switch to a Mac later this summer. My primary interest is in GUI development.

I am considering whether I should learn C on my current Ubuntu system and then transition to Objective-C once I get my iMac. Would learning C provide me with an advantage? Alternatively, should I learn Python on Ubuntu and then move on to Objective-C when I get my new computer?

**Recommendation:**

Learning C will definitely be beneficial, as Objective-C builds upon many of C's properties and adds object-oriented features. This foundational knowledge will make your transition to Objective-C smoother.

**Resources for Learning Objective-C:**

- **"Learn Objective-C on the Mac"** by Mark Dalrymple and Scott Knaster: This book is highly recommended for beginners and provides a solid introduction to the language.
- **"Learn Cocoa on the Mac"** or **"Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X"** by Aaron Hillegass: These books are excellent for diving into Cocoa, the framework used for macOS application development.
- **"Objective-C Developer Handbook"** by David Chisnall: This comprehensive resource is a great reference and can be read over a month or two.

**Compiler Recommendations:**

- **Clang**: This is the preferred compiler for modern Objective-C, especially if you want to work with Objective-C 2.0 features. Clang is actively developed and well-integrated with the latest Apple tools.
- **GCC and GNUstep**: While this combination can work, it is less ideal for modern Objective-C development, particularly for newer features and integration with Apple's toolchain.

By starting with C and then moving to Objective-C, you will build a strong foundation and be well-prepared for GUI development on macOS.
