### Problem Description
Currently, the only way to access `localStorage` is by invoking the `executeJavaScript()` method in `webContent`. This approach is not practical when dealing with multiple partitions, as it requires individual calls for each partition.

### Proposed Solution
Add a `localStorage` property to the session object, similar to how the `cookie` property is implemented. This would allow for more straightforward and efficient access to `localStorage` data across different partitions.

### Alternatives Considered
Another possible solution is to add a `fromPartition()` method to `webContent`, which would enable accessing `localStorage` data from a specific partition.

### Additional Information
Is there a way to export `localStorage` data from a persistent partition in a WebView?
