# Detection Rate and False Positive Rate Analysis

| Detection rate (Voiceprint) | Detection rate (CPVSAD) | False positive rate (Voiceprint) | False positive rate (CPVSAD) |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 50                          | 60                       | 70                              | 80                            |

**Figure 11b: Detection Rate and False Positive Rate with Propagation Model Change**

Figure 11b presents the results under varying propagation models. The model parameters are periodically modified during the simulation. It is evident that CPVSAD's performance deteriorates significantly, while Voiceprint remains largely unaffected by these changes. This disparity arises because CPVSAD relies on predefined statistical testing based on the propagation model parameters. Any deviation in these parameters can lead to inaccurate results. Conversely, Voiceprint does not depend on any propagation models, making it more adaptable to different environments and complex conditions.

## VI. Field Test

### A. Experiment Setup

In this field test, we evaluated the performance of the proposed Voiceprint in real-world scenarios. Four vehicles, each equipped with DSRC radios and the Voiceprint application, were used. Experiments were conducted in various environments, including a campus, rural area, urban area, and highway, as depicted in Figure 12. The setup included one malicious node (ID = 1) generating two Sybil nodes (IDs = 101 and 102), and three normal nodes (IDs = 2, 3, and 4). Normal node 2 was positioned as close as possible to the malicious node during the test. The initial transmitted powers for the physical nodes (nodes 1-4) were set at 20 dBm, while the Sybil nodes 101 and 102 had initial transmitted powers of 23 dBm and 17 dBm, respectively. The observation time was 20 seconds, and the detection period was 1 minute. Given the limited number of vehicles, the constant threshold was set to 0.05046 at a density of 4 vhls/km.

### B. Results and Analysis

The test durations in different areas were 13 minutes 21 seconds, 22 minutes 40 seconds, 34 minutes 46 seconds, and 11 minutes 12 seconds, corresponding to the campus, rural area, urban area, and highway, respectively. Consequently, the total number of detections conducted were 14, 23, 35, and 11 times, respectively. All measured DTW distances were compared against the threshold, and the results recorded by normal node 3 are shown in Figure 13.

From Figure 13, it is clear that the detection rate was 100% across all scenarios, with a false positive rate of 0.95%. Only one instance of a false positive occurred, where normal node 2 was incorrectly identified as a Sybil node. To investigate this false detection, we analyzed the GPS traces and the statuses, distances, and speeds of all vehicles.

According to the GPS traces of malicious node 1, normal node 2, and normal node 3, all nodes remained stationary during the detection period. As illustrated in Figure 14, the false detection occurred at an intersection where all vehicles stopped for a red light. The measured distances between the nodes were 3.8 meters (node 1 and 2), 198.9 meters (node 1 and 3), and 195.2 meters (node 2 and 3). Due to the stationary nature of the nodes, the RSSI time series from malicious node 1 and normal node 2 were very similar, leading to the false detection.

We also estimated the computational complexity of Voiceprint. With an observation time of 20 seconds and a transmission frequency of 10 Hz, up to 200 RSSI values were collected for each time series. The average time to compare two RSSI time series was 0.1995 milliseconds. In an extreme case with 80 neighboring vehicles (traffic density of 200 vhls/km and a transmission range of up to 400 meters), the total computing time was approximately 630 milliseconds. This time complexity is manageable for Sybil attack detection.

### Conclusion

Real-world experiments confirmed that Voiceprint is effective in various environments, particularly in rural and highway settings where vehicles maintain continuous movement. While stationary conditions, such as red lights and traffic jams, may lead to false alarms, Voiceprint remains a viable method considering its cost, complexity, and overall performance. We recommend conducting multiple detection periods to reduce the false positive rate.

## VII. Conclusion

In this paper, we introduced Voiceprint, an RSSI-based method for detecting Sybil attacks in VANETs. The motivation for Voiceprint stems from the observation that RSSI time series exhibit similar patterns between Sybil nodes. Unlike other methods, Voiceprint does not rely on radio propagation models, making it widely applicable in diverse environments. Additionally, it operates independently without requiring a trust relationship or support from centralized nodes, such as base stations or RSUs. Simulation and field test results demonstrate the effectiveness of Voiceprint.

Future work will focus on several directions to enhance Voiceprint. First, we will explore the use of Service Channels (SCH) to increase the beacon rate and collect more RSSI values. Second, we will conduct additional real-world experiments to address the limitations of RSSI-based methods, especially in scenarios involving power control by malicious nodes. These efforts aim to improve the robustness and accuracy of Voiceprint in detecting sophisticated attacks.
