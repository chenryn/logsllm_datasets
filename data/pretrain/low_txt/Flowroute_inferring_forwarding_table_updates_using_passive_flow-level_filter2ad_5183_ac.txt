### Figure 5: Network Topology and Forwarding Updates

- **(a) Initial Topology**: This diagram represents the initial network topology before any updates occur.
- **(b) Transient Loop Formation**: Router A updates its next hop to B, but B is slow to update and continues to forward packets to A, resulting in a transient one-hop loop.
- **(c) Loop Resolution**: After B updates its next hop to D, the loop is resolved, and the network stabilizes.

### Relationship Between Late Forwarding Table Updates and Transient Routing Loops

We analyzed the relationship between late forwarding table updates and transient routing loops. Out of 58 OSPF event clusters where we observed late forwarding table updates, 33 were accompanied by transient one-hop loops. 

- **Figure 5(a)**: Shows the initial network topology for one such event.
- **Figure 6**: Illustrates the route changes at routers A and B as they react to the OSPF event cluster, which occurs from approximately 33280 to 33345 seconds since the start of the day.

This OSPF event cluster includes a cost-out event for link C-E, meaning the link metric is increased such that it will not be part of any computed shortest path.

- **Top Graph in Figure 6**: Displays the forwarding table changes for router A, which are consistent with OSPF events (A changes its next hop from C to B).
- **Second Graph in Figure 6**: Shows that the forwarding table changes for router B towards certain destinations occur several seconds later (B changes its next hop from A to D).
- **Third Graph in Figure 6**: Depicts the transition ranges for routers A and B towards the set of destinations for which B updated late.

From around 33320 to 33360 seconds, A forwards packets to B (since it has already changed its next hop), while B continues to forward packets to A (because it has not yet updated). This results in a forwarding loop between A and B, as shown in Figure 5(b).

After 33360 seconds, when B updates its forwarding table to use D as its next hop, the routing stabilizes, as illustrated in Figure 5(c).

- **Bottom Graph in Figure 6**: Shows the utilization on links A-B and B-A, averaged over 10-second intervals during this event. Link utilization increases in both directions during the routing loop. The spikes in utilization persist only during the loop, suggesting they are primarily due to the routing anomaly.

### Discussion

#### 6.1 Network-Wide Effects of Routing Changes

FlowRoute uses data collected from hundreds of routers in the ISP’s network, enabling operators to quantify the network-wide effects of routing changes. For example, FlowRoute can measure how many routers in the network are affected by a routing change, as well as traffic shifts and changes in link utilization caused by routing events, at a finer time resolution than SNMP-based approaches. Due to space constraints, we could not present the results of measuring these network-wide effects.

#### 6.2 Flexible NetFlow

Flexible NetFlow [5] is expected to become more prevalent in production networks. It allows operators to configure the fields that are part of the flow key, such as the input interface, output interface, and destination (iBGP next hop). Using this feature, routers can directly export Routing Flow Records, which include first and last packet timestamps, providing more detailed timing information about routing changes. Flexible NetFlow can also help overcome some of the problems of packet and flow sampling, which affect FlowRoute's temporal resolution. By configuring Flexible NetFlow to select all probe packets based on a predefined signature, we can set the active probing rate to achieve the desired temporal resolution.

#### 6.3 Online FlowRoute

Currently, FlowRoute uses an offline approach, processing NetFlow records from different routers and creating Routing Flow Records using topology data collected by SNMP. This process takes a few hours to handle a day's worth of NetFlow data from several hundred routers. There is no inherent reason why this paradigm cannot be extended to work in near real-time. A future system could run a collector that aggregates and processes flow-level measurements from multiple routers, providing alerts about routing events. Tackling the systems and scalability issues involved in making FlowRoute near-online is a direction we plan to pursue in future work.
