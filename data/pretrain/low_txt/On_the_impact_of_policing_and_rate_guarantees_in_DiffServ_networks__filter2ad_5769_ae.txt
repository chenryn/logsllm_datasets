The initial results for the two clips, "Lost" and "Dark," show similar behavior, suggesting that the different motion characteristics of their content do not significantly affect the basic relationship between video quality and network resources. While video characteristics will influence the absolute level of quality achievable given certain network resources, general trends should remain consistent across different types of video clips.

For example, comparing the results of Figure 7 and Figure 10, which correspond to the 1.7Mbps encoding rate versions of the "Lost" and "Dark" clips, respectively, we observe that for a token bucket depth of 3000 bytes and a token rate of 1.9 Mbps, both clips experience a similar frame loss of about 1%. However, their respective quality measures differ, with "Lost" at 0.19 and "Dark" at 0.14. Despite these differences, which are more pronounced at higher encoding rates, the general shape of the quality index curves is similar for both clips.

### Key Conclusions from Initial Experiments

1. **Non-linear Relationship Between Video Quality and Network Performance:**
   - The relationship between video quality and network-level performance improvements is highly non-linear.
   - In some regions, improvements in frame losses have little effect on the quality of the received video, which remains relatively poor until a cutoff point is reached.
   - Once this cutoff point is passed, video quality improves much more rapidly than the corresponding improvements in frame loss.
   - The location of the cutoff point and the subsequent difference in slope between video quality and frame losses vary based on the encoding rate and the type of clip, but the behavior is consistent across all experiments.

### Network Service Parameters for Adequate Video Quality

- **Token Rate Below Encoding Rate:**
  - Setting the token rate value below the encoding rate is ineffective due to the dropping actions taken on non-conformant packets by the ingress policer.
- **Token Bucket Depth:**
  - With a token bucket depth of 3000 bytes (2 Ethernet MTUs), the token rate must be set around or even above the maximum encoding rate of the clip to achieve good video quality.
  - Increasing the token bucket depth to 4500 bytes allows a token rate set to the average (constant) encoding rate to be sufficient, despite significant variations in network-level transmission rates.
- **EF PHB Suitability:**
  - A service built on the EF PHB may not be suitable for efficient streaming video transmission due to constraints on the token bucket depth.
  - Relaxing the token bucket depth limits slightly may make such a service more useful for video streaming applications, though this needs to be balanced against its impact on delay and losses in the network.

### Further Experiments on Video Quality and Network Resources

- **Objective:**
  - To determine whether it is better to lose a large number of packets from a high-quality video stream or fewer packets from a lower-quality video.
- **Method:**
  - Used the "Lost" and "Dark" video clips encoded at 1.0Mbps, 1.5Mbps, and 1.7Mbps, and compared the quality of the received video to the highest quality 1.7Mbps version.
- **Results:**
  - The best performing stream in terms of quality score is always the one with the closest encoding rate to the token rate.
  - The impairments caused by packet losses have a much larger impact on video quality than the differences in raw video quality caused by different encoding rates.

### Local Testbed Results

- **Objective:**
  - To explore the same set of issues as the QBone experiments using a different video server and more configurations.
- **Key Findings:**
  - Frame loss is not an accurate predictor of video quality; small differences in frame loss can result in large differences in video quality and vice versa.
  - Increasing the token bucket depth from 3000 bytes to 4500 bytes resulted in significant improvements in achieving nearly perfect video quality using a token rate close to the encoding rate.

These findings confirm the earlier observations and provide valuable insights into optimizing video streaming over networks.
