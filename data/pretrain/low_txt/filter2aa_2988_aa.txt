#### Part 1: Background
- **Blockchain & Smart Contracts & Ethereum**
  - **What is Blockchain?**
    - A large-scale, globally decentralized computer network.
    - A system where users can interact by sending transactions, which are guaranteed by a consensus mechanism.
  - **Advantages of Blockchain:**
    - Unified database with rapid consensus.
    - Large-scale fault-tolerant mechanism.
    - Not reliant on trust or controlled by any single administrator (excluding private/consortium blockchains).
    - Auditable transaction history.
    - Automation without human involvement.
  - **Applications of Blockchain:**
    - Cryptocurrency: digital assets on the blockchain.
    - Record registration (e.g., domain name system based on blockchain).
    - Timestamping for tracking high-value data.
    - Financial contracts.
    - General computation.
  - **Non-monetary Characteristics:**
    - Supports functionalities such as asset issuance, crowdfunding, domain-name registration, ownership registration, market forecasting, Internet of Things, voting, etc.
  - **Ethereum:**
    - Around 2013, it was realized that blockchain could be used for a wide range of applications beyond cryptocurrency.
    - **Smart Contracts:**
      - Pieces of code that live on the blockchain and execute commands exactly as programmed.
      - Defined as a computer program running in a secure environment that automatically transfers digital assets according to predefined rules.
    - **How to Build a Smart Contract:**
      - Use a blockchain with a built-in programming language.
      - Maximize abstraction and versatility.
      - Ethereum's EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) provides an isolated operating environment for smart contracts, ensuring they have limited access to external resources.

#### Part 2: Related Safety Problems
- **The Ethereum Ecosystem:**
  - On average, 100,000 new users join the Ethereum ecosystem daily, with over 1 million transactions per day.
- **Safety Issues in Ethereum:**
  - **Exchange Vulnerabilities:**
    - Potential for hijacking.
  - **Wallet Vulnerabilities:**
    - Overflow attacks.
  - **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities:**
    - Examples:
      - April 2018: BEC contract.
      - May 2018: EDU contract.
      - June 2018: SNC contract.
    - These vulnerabilities directly affected major exchanges, including token issuance, recharges, and withdrawals.
  - **Vulnerability Analysis:**
    - In March 2018, nearly 1 million smart contracts were analyzed, with 34,200 found to be easily hackable.
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Conduct thorough and objective audits of smart contracts.
    - Implement emergency response plans when vulnerabilities are detected.
    - Provide rewards for bug detection.

#### Part 3: Replay Attacks on Smart Contracts
- **Replay Attack:**
  - If a transaction is legitimate on one blockchain, it is also legitimate on another blockchain.
  - Example: Transferring BTC1 might simultaneously transfer BTC2/BTC3.
- **Our Discovery:**
  - Many smart contracts use similar methods to verify signature validity, making them susceptible to replay attacks.
- **Our Motivation:**
  - Raise awareness about replay attacks in smart contracts.
  - Detect vulnerabilities to enhance security.
  - Increase risk awareness for contract creators and protect investors' interests.
- **Findings:**
  - We identified replay attack vulnerabilities in 52 smart contracts.
  - Analyzed a smart contract example to verify the replay attack vulnerability.
