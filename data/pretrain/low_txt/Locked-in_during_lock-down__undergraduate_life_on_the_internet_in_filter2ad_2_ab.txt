### Analysis of Internet Usage Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic

#### Introduction
This study examines the changes in internet usage patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on a university setting. We analyze data from UC San Diego's passive network monitoring system to understand how different user groups (domestic and international students) adapted their online behavior.

#### Data and Methodology
We collected data from February 2020 to May 2020, covering the period before and after the implementation of stay-at-home orders. The data includes the number of active devices, median and average bytes transferred, and normalized traffic volume. We also considered specific events such as the state of emergency, WHO declaration of a pandemic, and academic breaks.

#### Classification of International Students
Due to privacy concerns, we do not have direct information about which devices belong to international students. Instead, we used geolocation data to classify users. For each device, we calculated the weighted geographic midpoint of the destination IP addresses visited in February 2020. If this midpoint fell outside the United States, we classified the user as an international student. This method identified 1,022 devices (18% of post-shutdown users) as likely belonging to international students.

#### Comparison of Internet Usage
We compared the internet usage of domestic and international students by plotting the median volume of traffic per device, excluding Zoom traffic (Figure 4). The main difference was observed during the academic break, where international students showed an increase in traffic, while domestic students' traffic remained stable.

#### Application Usage
##### Online Classes
When classes transitioned to online platforms, primarily using Zoom, we analyzed the aggregate Zoom traffic (Figure 5). The overall Zoom traffic increased, with periodic dips during weekends. Weekday traffic peaked between 8 AM and 6 PM, corresponding to class times. On weekends, there was a small spike in the afternoon, possibly due to social and extracurricular activities.

##### Social Media
The popularity of social media sites, particularly Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, increased during the pandemic. We manually analyzed traffic to create signatures for each platform and computed the duration of user sessions (Figure 6).

- **Facebook**: Domestic usage was relatively stable until May, when it decreased. International students, however, increased their usage during the campus shutdown.
- **Instagram**: Domestic usage decreased in May, while international students increased their usage.
- **TikTok**: Domestic users showed a steady increase in the third quartile and 99th percentile, indicating some users continued to increase their usage, while others returned to pre-pandemic levels. International users also increased their usage, but with more variance.

##### Gaming
Gaming traffic increased significantly, especially on platforms like Steam and Nintendo Switch.

- **Steam**: Domestic students increased their usage in March but decreased in April and May. International students showed a similar pattern but with a higher peak in March and April (Figure 7).
- **Nintendo Switch**: Sales and usage surged, attributed to the release of "Animal Crossing: New Horizons" and the need for indoor entertainment. We identified a significant drop in the number of active Switches on campus, from 1,097 to 267, and 40 new Switches appeared in April and May (Figure 8).

#### Conclusion
Our study provides insights into how internet-based behaviors changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. While overall traffic increased dramatically in April 2020, it returned to pre-pandemic levels in May. Entertainment usage increased, and classroom-related platforms were less utilized on weekends. International students exhibited different patterns of recreational behavior compared to their domestic counterparts.
