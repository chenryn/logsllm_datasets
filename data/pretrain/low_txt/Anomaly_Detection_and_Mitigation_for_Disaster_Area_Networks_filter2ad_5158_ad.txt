### Detection Mechanism

The detection mechanism is based on tagging the packets sent by the attacker and the packets sent in response to them. In each aggregation interval \( I_a \) (see Section 4.3), a node is considered to be under attack if at least one of the tagged packets has been received during that interval.

### Network-Wide Average Results

The network-wide average results in terms of Detection Rate (DR) and False Positive Rate (FPR), using different \( T_2 \) values, are depicted in Figures 8 and 9. These numbers are computed by averaging the performance of all 25 anomaly detectors over the entire test interval. The curves demonstrate that in highly partitioned networks with very different conditions, it is not feasible to analyze the results of the detection mechanism on an aggregate basis using these metrics. While the earlier results were convincing about the success of the approach, these curves show mediocre results overall.

### Observations

We have observed that the traffic flow, the type of attack, and the number of attackers in each partition produce very different detection rates. The network topology in our disaster area is composed of eight partitions, more or less stable throughout the simulation, with moving nodes acting as "bridges" over the partitions. Analyzing the results node by node, we confirmed that the parameter with the most influence on detection performance is the proximity of the adversaries to the fair nodes.

| # Adversaries per Partition | Draining Attack | Grey Hole Attack |
|-----------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| 2                           | Best DR: 94%, FPR: 6% | Best DR: 95%, FPR: 6% |
|                             | Worst DR: 93%, FPR: 8% | Worst DR: 63%, FPR: 8% |
|                             | Average DR: 70%, FPR: 5% | Average DR: 60%, FPR: 10% |
| 1                           | Best DR: 90%, FPR: 5% | Best DR: 97%, FPR: 3% |
|                             | Worst DR: 85%, FPR: 7% | Worst DR: 44%, FPR: 4% |
|                             | Average DR: 55%, FPR: 2% | Average DR: 40%, FPR: 7% |
| 0                           | Best DR: 58%, FPR: 5% | Best DR: 93%, FPR: 4% |
|                             | Worst DR: 45%, FPR: 8% | Worst DR: 29%, FPR: 6% |
|                             | Average DR: 66%, FPR: 3% | Average DR: 11%, FPR: 9% |

Results calculated with the alert aggregation threshold \( T_2 \) at 5% demonstrate that the less a partition is affected by attacks, the worse the performance of the detection. That is, the classes with zero and one adversary reduce the average detection performance. Note that despite having partitions with no adversaries, some attacks are received through sporadic contacts with other partitions.

### Transient vs. Continuous Attacks

Another aspect observed is that in transient cases, the false positive rate is slightly lower than in continuous cases. This is because the attacks are always detected with a small delay, but the alarm persists even after the attack is finished. Since the attack is not continuously received uniformly by all nodes due to their mobility, there are gaps during which alarms are enabled and counted as false positives. Continuous attacks are longer and present more of these gaps, highlighting the complexity of performance accounting using these metrics.

### Conclusions

In this article, we presented a holistic anomaly detection and mitigation approach for dissemination protocols in intermittently connected networks. The approach was integrated and evaluated within the Random Walk Gossip dissemination protocol applied in a disaster area scenario.

We adopted a statistical-based detector algorithm to combat the typical resource constraints associated with the devices, particularly in terms of CPU power used for learning and detection. The threat model for which the approach was validated focuses on making a significant impact on fair nodes with minimal energy investment by the adversary. Moreover, the adversary's behavior is so similar to normal behavior that it is challenging to distinguish attacks through the creation of constraints, signatures, or rules, making this environment particularly challenging.

To address this threat model, we added a mitigation mode to the basic protocol operation. When in this mode, small modifications in the protocol create a chance of deciding when the node's behavior should change due to a suspected attack. This is different from earlier works where identification of the culprit and individual isolation or specific treatment is the response. The integrated protocol can also be run in the original no-mitigation mode when no attacks are expected, providing no protection. Thus, the added detection-mitigation algorithm can be seen as an enhancement of an earlier protocol that works in a fair-play scenario. We believe this approach can be generalized and applied to other dissemination protocols.

Furthermore, our approach assumes full knowledge of the adversary about the protocol and even the anomaly detection scheme. The adversary cannot easily adapt to avoid detection due to the unpredictability of what learning has accomplished in the normality model. This is a simple yet powerful aspect of our scheme.

### Evaluation

The evaluation of the approach demonstrated its effectiveness by showing resistance to attacks using network performance metrics. In both transient and continuous attack modes, we showed that mitigation brings the network back to performance levels close to pre-attack scenarios. The analysis also highlighted the complexity of using classic metrics, such as detection rate and false positive rate, in highly partitioned networks. These metrics are not appropriate for measuring detection performance on a global basis in such networks.

### Future Work

Future work includes identifying the applicability of the methods to more attack types, an intermittent version of the current attacks, and the addition of new threat models. It is also interesting to explore which parts of this resilience to attacks can be beneficially integrated into the dissemination algorithm. Current work includes the addition of two new components to the detection-mitigation loop:
1. A diagnosis element that runs in parallel with a general (early) mitigation, useful for adapting the mitigation without pinpointing attacker nodes.
2. An adaptive component that decides when and how to end a given mitigation phase and return to a less careful mode.

Another aspect requiring more research is the study of the impact of mitigation actions. When a node enables mitigation, it may change the system's behavior and be detected as an anomaly, creating a recursive chain of alarms among the nodes. This is a complex problem because the system's behavior can be affected by the mitigation actions applied by all nodes.
