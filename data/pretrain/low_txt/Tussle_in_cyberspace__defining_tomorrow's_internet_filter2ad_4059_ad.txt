### The Future of End-to-End Arguments

The increasing complexity of mechanisms, the potential for reduced transparency, and a growing focus on enhancing existing applications at the expense of new ones raise questions about the future of end-to-end arguments. We argue that these principles remain valid and powerful but require a more nuanced articulation in today's context. The following discussion provides some guidance.

#### Evolution and Enhancement of Existing Applications

The evolution and enhancement of mature applications are inevitable. As applications gain popularity, various stakeholders, including application providers and Internet Service Providers (ISPs), will seek to integrate or improve them. This may be driven by vertical integration, performance enhancements, reliability improvements, or other motivations. Such involvement will likely increase complexity, potentially decrease reliability or predictability, and may lead the application to deviate from its original vision. While we cannot prevent this, designing applications to allow users to control which network features are invoked can mitigate some of these issues.

#### Protecting Maturing Applications

To protect maturing applications, we must influence the tussle between different stakeholders. Application designers who wish to preserve user choice and empowerment should be provided with guidelines to achieve these goals. This suggests the need for "application design guidelines" to help designers avoid pitfalls and manage the challenges of success.

#### Keeping the Internet Open for New Applications

Maintaining an open and transparent internet for new applications is crucial. Innovation and the launch of new applications have been the driving forces behind the growth of the internet and the creation of new value. Barriers to new applications are more destructive than network-based support for established applications. New applications, which often start incrementally, benefit most from the transparent simplicity promoted by end-to-end arguments. By isolating tussles, we can ensure that those seeking transparency can achieve it, even as others seek to control mature applications or address trust issues.

#### Addressing Failures of Transparency

Transparency failures will occur, and we must design for such scenarios. For example, when an IP address is unreachable, there is currently little useful information available to the average user. Tools for fault isolation and error reporting would be beneficial, but the challenge lies in reporting the problem to the right person in the right language. Fault reporting is not just a technical tool but also a means of managing tussles. Some devices may intentionally provide no error information or reveal their presence, which must be considered in the design of diagnostic tools.

#### The Irresistibility of Peeking

If information is visible in a packet, intermediate nodes will inevitably look at it. Therefore, the ultimate defense of the end-to-end model is end-to-end encryption. While encryption has drawbacks, such as potentially missing out on ISP-offered benefits, it allows users to decide if ISP actions are beneficial or hindrances. Encrypting data might also escalate tensions between users and ISPs, but in a competitive market, this is less likely. In state-run monopoly ISPs, policy may override technology, making encryption a way to force explicit policy statements.

#### Multi-Way Applications and Encryption

In multi-way applications involving third parties, the concept of "end to end" becomes more complex, as does the proper use of encryption. These considerations highlight the need for careful design and policy-making.

### Lessons for Designers

A long-standing principle in system design is the separation of policy and mechanism. This paper challenges the simplicity of this principle, suggesting that true value-neutral design is extremely difficult. Mechanisms define the range of policies that can be invoked, thus bounding the range of choices. However, attempting to separate policy and mechanism can isolate regions of the system from tussles, allowing different tussles to play out at different speeds.

#### User Empowerment

User empowerment, the preference for users to choose their applications, servers, and services, is a shared value. This principle is fundamental to the internet, as it drives competition and change. While some argue that user empowerment is a bias, others see it as a core tenet of the internet. This paper supports the latter view, as choice is a basic tool for managing tussles.

### Conclusion

As the internet becomes a full component of society, the importance of recognizing and managing tussles becomes clear. Technical designers should not deny the reality of tussles but recognize their power to shape them. This recognition leads to new, challenging technical problems that we must address.
