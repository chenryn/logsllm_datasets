## Abstract
Traditional static data center (DC) network designs often present a trade-off between cost and performance. Simple leaf-spine networks are cost-effective but can be oversubscribed, while "fat tree" architectures offer good worst-case performance but are expensive. Recent research has shown the potential of augmenting an oversubscribed network with reconfigurable inter-rack wireless or optical links.

Inspired by this, we introduce FireFly, an inter-rack network solution that pushes DC network design to the extreme on three key fronts: (1) all links are reconfigurable, (2) all links are wireless, and (3) non-top-of-rack (ToR) switches are eliminated. This vision, if realized, can offer significant benefits in terms of increased flexibility, reduced equipment cost, and minimal cabling complexity.

To achieve this, we propose the use of free-space optics (FSO) due to their high data rates, long ranges, and zero interference. We demonstrate the viability of this architecture by building a proof-of-concept prototype using commodity components and developing practical heuristics to address algorithmic and system-level challenges in network design and management.

## 1. Introduction
A robust data center (DC) network must meet several goals: high throughput, low equipment and management costs, robustness to dynamic traffic patterns, incremental expandability, low cabling complexity, and low power and cooling costs. Conventional designs either overprovision for worst-case traffic (e.g., fat-trees or Clos networks), leading to high costs, or are oversubscribed (e.g., simple trees or leaf-spine architectures), which are cost-effective but perform poorly under congestion.

Recent work suggests a promising middle ground by augmenting an oversubscribed network with a few reconfigurable links, using either 60 GHz RF wireless or optical switches. Inspired by this, we envision a radically different DC architecture that pushes the network design to the logical extreme on three dimensions: (1) all inter-rack links are flexible, (2) all inter-rack links are wireless, and (3) the core switching backbone is eliminated.

This vision, if realized, promises unprecedented qualitative and quantitative benefits for DC networks:
1. Reduced infrastructure cost without compromising performance.
2. Increased effective operating capacity and improved application performance by alleviating transient congestion.
3. Simplified cabling and reduced overheads (e.g., obstructed cooling).
4. Enablement of new topology structures that would otherwise be unfeasible due to cabling costs.
5. Energy proportionality through flexible link activation and deactivation.

This paper describes FireFly, a first but significant step toward realizing this vision. Each ToR is equipped with reconfigurable wireless FSO links. The centralized FireFly controller reconfigures the topology and forwarding rules to adapt to changing traffic patterns.

While prior work has explored FSO links in DCs, they have not established a viable hardware design or addressed practical network design and management challenges. Our work bridges this gap along three dimensions:
- **Practical steerable FSO devices (§3)**: We establish the viability of a small-form factor FSO design using commodity optical devices and demonstrate two promising steering technologies.
- **Network provisioning (§4)**: We argue for optimizing a new notion of dynamic bisection bandwidth and show that random regular graphs are surprisingly effective.
- **Network management (§5, §6)**: We develop fast heuristics for topology selection and traffic engineering, ensuring the network remains connected and per-packet latency is bounded during reconfigurations.

We evaluate our FSO prototype through controlled lab experiments and a longitudinal study in a real DC setting, finding that the links are robust and achieve wireline-equivalent throughput. We also evaluate the end-to-end performance of FireFly using detailed packet-level simulations, large-scale flow-level simulations, and virtual emulation platforms. Our results show that FireFly can achieve performance close to a full bisection bandwidth network at 40-60% of the cost.

Despite operational concerns related to maintenance, reliability, and operator reluctance, we believe there is value in exploring an FSO-based all-wireless design. Such a vision could lead to unprecedented benefits and inspire other novel use cases for FSO in DCs.

## 2. Motivation and Overview
We begin by motivating key aspects of our vision: full flexibility, wireless links, and the use of free-space optics.

### 2.1 Case for Full Flexibility
A key intuition behind FireFly's design is that a fully-flexible inter-rack network can yield near-optimal bisection bandwidth even without any core (non-ToR) switches.

We consider an abstract model of a DC network with \( n \) racks (and hence \( n \) ToR switches). We compare two abstract DC designs:
- **FBB (Full-Bisection Bandwidth)**: A full-bisection bandwidth network.
- **Flexible(f)**: An architecture with only ToR switches, each having \( f \) flexible ports that can be rewired as needed to connect to another ToR switch.

The performance metric of interest is the evacuation time of satisfying the demands in a given inter-rack traffic matrix. For FBB, there is no congestion, making the computation straightforward. For Flexible(f), we compute the evacuation time by determining a near-optimal sequence of reconfigurations.

Figure 2 shows the normalized performance and cost of Flexible(f) relative to FBB, for varying ratios of the number of flexible ports to the number of servers on each rack. The key takeaway is that the coreless, fully-flexible Flexible(f) architecture yields near-optimal performance when the number of flexible ports (\( f \)) equals the number of servers per rack, and at this point, its cost is only 40% of FBB (assuming FBB to be a complete FatTree).

### 2.2 Case for Wireless via Free-Space Optics
To realize a Flexible(f)-like network, we need a "patch-panel" between racks, which is infeasible due to high fanout, backplane capacity, cabling complexity, and single-point failure. Thus, we look toward reconfigurable wireless links between ToR switches.

RF-based wireless solutions (e.g., 60GHz) face significant challenges in managing interference and achieving high data rates. Alternatively, FSO offers narrow, interference-free laser beams, enabling Gbps–Tbps bitrates at long distances with low transmit power. Optical spectrum is unregulated and has no bandwidth limitations, making FSO an ideal choice.

### 2.3 FireFly System Overview
FireFly uses a fully-flexible inter-rack fabric enabled by wireless FSO links (Figure 1). Traditional wires are used for intra-rack connections, and an out-of-band control network configures the ToR switches and FSO devices.

Each ToR is equipped with steerable FSO devices, which export APIs to the controller for reconfiguration. We exploit the space above the racks to create a reconfigurable wireless fabric.
