### Compliance Standards and Their Real-World Application

This section discusses the application of compliance standards in real-world environments, drawing on common themes identified across various standards. Researchers could leverage these insights to design guidelines or templates that help avoid common issues when writing new standards.

### Appendix B: Expert Survey

**Consent Form:**
- Participant is presented with a consent form. Please check all that apply (you may choose any number of these statements):
  - I am age 18 or older.
  - I have read this consent form or had it read to me.
  - I voluntarily agree to participate in this research and want to continue to the survey.

**Introduction:**
- This survey will ask you to assess the validity of an independent evaluation of [standard name]. Please be as candid and detailed as possible.

**Questions:**
1. If your organization followed the standard as written and nothing else, would your organization be vulnerable to this issue? (Yes/No/Possibly)
2. If yes or possibly, in your opinion, what is the likelihood of this vulnerability being exploited if the standard is followed as written and nothing else?
   - Frequent: Occurs often, continuously experienced.
   - Likely: Occurs several times.
   - Occasional: Occurs sporadically.
   - Seldom: Unlikely, but could occur at some time.
   - Unlikely: Can assume it will not occur.
3. If yes or possibly, in your opinion, what is the severity associated with exploitation if the standard is followed as written and nothing else?
   - Catastrophic: Complete system loss, major property damage, full data breach, corruption of all data.
   - Critical: Major system damage, significant property damage, significant data breach, corruption of sensitive data.
   - Moderate: Minor system damage, minor property damage, partial data breach.
   - Negligible: Minor system impairment.
4. If yes or possibly, is there past evidence of this vulnerability within your organization? (Yes/No/Maybe)
5. If yes or possibly, what would you recommend, based on your experience, to remedy this issue? (Open response)
6. If no, what additional policies, procedures, or defensive techniques does your organization use to mitigate this issue? (Open response)

**End of Survey:**
- Does your organization allow waivers to the compliance standard? If yes, how frequently are they used? If no, how frequently does this create issues for your organization?

**Demographics:**
- What is the highest level of school you have completed or the highest degree you have received?
- Please estimate the number of years of experience you have in the compliance and information technology fields.
- Please describe your work role and your interaction with compliance standards.
- Please estimate the size of the organization you work in.
