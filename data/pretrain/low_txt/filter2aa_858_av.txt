### Figure 16. DEMATEL Indirect Influence Summary
This research suggests that IPv6 has the potential to be a more influential factor in strategic cybersecurity than three current cyber attack advantages, including asymmetry and inadequate cyber defense. This result is the most significant revelation in this study.

DEMATEL analysis highlights two powerful attributes of IPv6:
1. **Resistance to Outside Influence**: IPv6 is highly resistant to external influences, making it more reliable than other factors in the system.
2. **High Impact on Anonymity**: IPv6 significantly influences the most potent cyber attack advantage, anonymity, at a very high level.

These attributes, combined with indirect influence calculations, amplify the impact of IPv6 throughout the system, enhancing its importance.

For decision-makers, this research suggests that IPv6 is currently the most efficient way to shift the dynamics of strategic cybersecurity in favor of cyber defense.

### Figure 17. Causal Loop Diagram: IPv6 System Impact
The causal loop diagram in Figure 17 specifically highlights the significant influence relationship between IPv6 and the rest of the system.

### Key Findings
All three other mitigation strategies received negative scores in the final index (Figure 13), indicating they are net receivers rather than providers of influence in the system. The second-place mitigation strategy is the application of the world’s best military doctrine, *Art of War*, to cyber conflict. It is the only other mitigation strategy to rank ahead of even one cyber attack advantage. Cyber arms control and deterrence remain at the bottom of the list for reasons discussed earlier in this book.

In summary, this analysis suggests that, beyond the four cyber attack mitigation strategies evaluated, decision-makers could prioritize their investment in other mitigation strategies by category, according to the following formula:

1. **Technical**
2. **Military**
3. **Political**

A technology-centric approach has a greater DEMATEL-calculated influence on the system of strategic cybersecurity, partly because it is more reliable than human-dependent approaches, especially when politics come into play. Thus, IPv6 ranks first among the strategies, and arms control (a hybrid political/technical approach) moves ahead of deterrence (which relies solely on political/military factors) in the final calculation.

### V. Conclusion
#### 11. Research Contributions
In the post-World War II era, cybersecurity has evolved from a technical discipline to a strategic concept. The power of the Internet, our growing dependence on it, and the disruptive capability of cyber attackers now threaten national and international security.

The nature of security threats has not changed, but the Internet provides a new delivery mechanism that can increase the speed, scale, and power of an attack. National critical infrastructures are now at risk, not only during war but also in times of peace. Consequently, all future political and military conflicts will have a cyber dimension, whose size and impact are difficult to predict.

World leaders must address the threat of strategic cyber attacks with strategic responses in favor of cyber defense. In this book, the author examines four strategies that nation-states will likely adopt to mitigate the cyber attack threat: deterrence, arms control, doctrine, and technology.

- **Cyber Attack Deterrence**: Lacks credibility because hacker skills are easy to acquire, and attackers often remain anonymous while conducting high-asymmetry attacks.
- **Cyber Arms Control**: Appears unlikely due to the vastness of cyberspace and the difficulty in defining malicious code. However, political will, perhaps in the wake of a future cyber attack, could change the status quo.
- **Doctrine (Art of War)**: More helpful than the first two strategies, but there are at least ten distinctive aspects of the cyber battlefield that do not fit easily into Sun Tzu’s paradigm.
- **IPv6**: Addresses some current security problems but also creates new challenges, including a long and dangerous transition phase. Despite these shortcomings, DEMATEL clearly shows that among the four examined mitigation strategies, IPv6 is the most likely to have a tangible impact on reducing the key advantages of a cyber attacker, thus improving a nation’s strategic cyber defense posture. The simple reason is that it reduces the most influential advantage of a cyber attacker, anonymity, with a higher degree of reliability than other factors. Thus, the influence of IPv6 grows over time and impacts all other factors in strategic cybersecurity.

DEMATEL provided a way to analyze the four proposed mitigation strategies with scientific rigor. It calculated specific levels of influence for each key concept identified, created a causal loop diagram of the system, and determined the most efficient way to reduce the threat of strategic cyber attack among the four strategies.

The contributions of this book are summarized as follows:
- An argument that computer security has evolved from a technical discipline to a strategic concept.
- Evaluation of four distinct strategic approaches to mitigate the cyber attack threat and improve a nation’s cyber defense posture.
- Use of the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) to analyze key concepts.
- Recommendation to policymakers of IPv6 as the most efficient of the four cyber defense strategies.

### Suggestions for Future Research
DEMATEL has helped clarify the landscape of strategic cybersecurity. The author believes that DEMATEL could also be used to examine other outstanding problems related to cybersecurity. Here are three possibilities:

1. **Can a Cyber Attack Be an Act of War?**
   - The dynamic nature of cyberspace makes it difficult to predict the next cyber attack or its severity. An effects-based approach seems inevitable: if the level of human suffering or economic damage is high enough, national leaders will retaliate. This applies to both government and private sector critical infrastructures. A key challenge for national security planners is that the hacker tools and techniques required for cyber espionage are often the same as those for cyber attack. The difference lies in motivation: does the hacker desire merely to steal information, or is the attack a prelude to war?

2. **Can We Solve the Attribution Problem?**
   - Smart hackers exploit the international, maze-like architecture of the Internet to conduct anonymous or deniable cyber attacks. The trail of evidence often runs through countries with which the victim’s government has poor diplomatic relations or no law enforcement cooperation, and cyber investigations typically end at a hacked, abandoned computer, where the trail goes cold. This dynamic encourages “false flagging” operations—where the attacker tries to pin the blame on a third party—and creates an environment in which even terrorists can find a home on the Internet. Solving the attribution problem will require harmonizing cyber crime laws, improving cyber defense methods, and generating the political will to share evidence and intelligence.

3. **Can We Shift the Advantage to Cyber Defense?**
   - Hackers today have enormous advantages over cyber defenders, including anonymity and asymmetry. In fact, if there is a future war between major world powers, a significant degree of the fighting may take place in cyberspace, and the first victim of the conflict could even be the Internet itself. To shift the balance, cyber defenders require a higher level of trust in hardware and software, improved performance metrics for defense strategies, and the ability to realistically model the hacker threat in a laboratory. Because it is impossible to eliminate all malicious code from a network, cyber defenders need better ways to neutralize what they cannot find. Governments could also require Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to play a more helpful role in preventing the spread of malware.
