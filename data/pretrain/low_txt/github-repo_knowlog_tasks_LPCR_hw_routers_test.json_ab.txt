    - **优化后**: The number of ASes in the AS_PATH attribute from the peer [peer-address] has exceeded the limit. (Source Interface: [SourceInterface], Limit: [limit-value], VPN Instance: [VpnInstance], Address Family: [addrFamily], Operation: [operation])
      - **Note**: The AS_Path length exceeded the limit.

41. **ENTITYTRAP/4/CAPSINGLECORECPUUSAGERESUME**
    - **原始消息**: OID [oid] Cap CPU utilization of single core resumed from exceeding the pre-alarm threshold. (hwCapSingleCoreIndex=[INTEGER], hwCapSingleCoreThresholdCurrent=[INTEGER]%, hwCapSingleCoreThresholdValue=[INTEGER]%)
    - **解释**: The CPU usage of a single forwarding core in the system falls below the alarm threshold.
    - **优化后**: The CPU utilization of a single core has resumed from exceeding the pre-alarm threshold. (OID: [oid], Cap Single Core Index: [INTEGER], Current Threshold: [INTEGER]%, Threshold Value: [INTEGER]%)
      - **Note**: The CPU usage of a single forwarding core in the system has fallen below the alarm threshold.

42. **OPSA/6/OPS_CONTEXT_RETRIEVE_EXECUTE_SUCCEED**
    - **原始消息**: Script is [script-name], current event is [event-name], instance is [instance-id], retrieves script variable [varName].
    - **解释**: Succeeded in recovering the script variable in the execution phase.
    - **优化后**: The script [script-name] successfully retrieved the script variable [varName] during the execution phase. (Event: [event-name], Instance: [instance-id])

43. **OSPF/4/OGNLSA**
    - **原始消息**: OID [oid]: An LSA is generated. (LsdbAreaId=[area-id], LsdbType=[lsa-type], LsdbLsid=[lsdb-ls-id], LsdbRouterId=[lsdb-router-id], ProcessId=[process-id], RouterId=[router-id], InstanceName=[instance-name])
    - **解释**: 1. The status of the interface changed. 2. The status of the neighbor changed. 3. The routes imported by OSPF changed.
    - **优化后**: An LSA has been generated. (OID: [oid], LSDB Area ID: [area-id], LSDB Type: [lsa-type], LSDB LS ID: [lsdb-ls-id], LSDB Router ID: [lsdb-router-id], Process ID: [process-id], Router ID: [router-id], Instance Name: [instance-name])
      - **Possible Causes**:
        - The status of the interface changed.
        - The status of the neighbor changed.
        - The routes imported by OSPF changed.

44. **L3AD/4/RESOURCE_FULL**
    - **原始消息**: The resource of the table on the chip is not enough. (Type=[STRING])
    - **解释**: The number of next-hop entries on the outbound interface exceeded the maximum value.
    - **优化后**: The resource table on the chip is full. (Type: [STRING])
      - **Note**: The number of next-hop entries on the outbound interface has exceeded the maximum value.

45. **IPLPM/3/FLOW_ERROR**
    - **原始消息**: Add flow failed. (Instance=[ULONG])
    - **解释**: Cause 1: ACL resources are insufficient. Cause 2: The configuration delivery channel is faulty.
    - **优化后**: The flow addition failed. (Instance: [ULONG])
      - **Possible Causes**:
        - ACL resources are insufficient.
        - The configuration delivery channel is faulty.
