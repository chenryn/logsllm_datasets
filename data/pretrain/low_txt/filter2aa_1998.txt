## Introduction
All the publications discussed in this presentation share a common thread: they were all originally published without the backing of a major publishing house. This includes seven books, one magazine, three bestsellers, and five that did not achieve bestseller status.

## Background
### What is Self-Publishing?
**Definitions:**
- **Self-publishing** is the process where authors publish their own works rather than using established, third-party publishers.
- **Vanity publishing** involves a fee-based service where the author pays for the publication, often making most of its money from the author rather than the public.

**Characteristics:**
- Analogous to shareware/freeware
- Authors maintain control over their work
- Authors receive most or all of the proceeds
- Often niche-oriented

### Relevant Self-Published Works
**Online:**
- E-zines: Phrack, Soljo, CULT OF THE DEAD COW
- E-books, websites, and blogs: CCC.de, DeviantArt, Hackaday.com, Hackcanada.com, Slashdot, Attrition.org
- Streaming/shared mp3s: Phluid, cDc tunez / NSF Radio, Hacker Voice Radio

**Offline:**
- Magazines: 2600, Blacklisted 411, Die Datenschleuder
- Books: *Practical Packet Analysis* by Sanders, *Security Data Visualization* by Conti, *End of Dayz*, *Freax*, *Commodork*, *The Book of Cao*
- Radio and other: Off the Hook, Off the Wall, Dark Domain DVD-ROM

## Content
### What to Convey?
- **Quality:** Your work is good enough. Everyone has a unique story or idea to share.
- **Intellectual Property:** Be mindful of intellectual property rights to avoid legal issues.
- **Original Content:** Write about what you know.
- **Examples:**
  - *Commodork* (original content)
  - *The Book of Cao* and *Dark Domain* (republished content with proper licenses)
- **Obtaining Distribution Rights:** Follow copyright law and obtain necessary permissions.

## Investment
### What is Needed?
- **Audience:** Less important than content quality.
- **Time and Money:**
  - Online publishing is generally cheaper than offline.
  - ISBN: ~$25 for books/DVDs/individual issues of serials.
  - ISSN: Free for serials only.
  - UPC: $89 for all types of products.
- **Printing Options:**
  - **Print-on-Demand:** Low cost, no inventory management.
  - **Short Press Run:** Minimum lot quantities of 500-1000, slightly better print/binding quality.

## Publishing

## Marketing
### Promotion is a Never-Ending Job
- **Selling Yourself and Your Product:**

- **Online:**
  - Book-specific website, press releases, forums, blogs, e-zines, podcasts.
- **Offline:**
