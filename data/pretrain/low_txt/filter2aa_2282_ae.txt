### Tuning and Testing the Coil

Once you have cut the wire and started testing, it is no longer possible to add new turns. If you have a reliable multimeter, you can verify that the connections are stable before proceeding to the next step. It is important to note that the enamel coating on the wire will prevent conductivity, but the heat from a soldering iron will allow a joint to be formed. The enamel can also be removed by gently scraping with a razor blade.

The Hirose cable includes a wire pair for both low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) tuned coils, as indicated in the referenced wiki. The wire within the Hirose connector tested had stranded wires, which are ideal for connecting into a protoboard. The antenna can then be attached to the Proxmark3 through a breadboard and tested using the `hw tune` command. The initial tuning should show an optimal frequency below 125 kHz, as shown in Figure 13.

**Figure 13: Untuned LF Antenna**

By gradually removing coils, the optimal frequency will increase incrementally, as illustrated in Figure 14.

**Figure 14: Unwinding the Coil to Tune It**

Continue unwinding the coil until the tuning function indicates that your target frequency is the optimal frequency for the circuit. Since 125 kHz is the carrier frequency for most access control badges, this frequency was selected for the coil. For my Proxmark3, this turned out to be around 90 turns of the coil rather than the calculated 107 turns. This discrepancy could be due to component tolerances or uneven wire coiling, but it shouldn't matter as long as a decent voltage is observed.

### Antenna Construction and Size

The new antenna is not much different in size from a typical building access control card, making it ideal for blending in when used in card simulation mode. When constructing an antenna like this, remember that 40 AWG wire is extremely thin and easy to break. Using adhesives to hold the wires in place and secure the antenna to the cable can help prevent accidental damage. Otherwise, it can be very frustrating to complete the antenna only to accidentally tear off too much of the lead.

Using silicone sealant around the coils helps keep them in place and tightly wound, adding strength to the fragile magnet wire. Heat shrink tubing and hot glue can also reduce tension and provide additional support.

### BADge Antenna

Given that the antenna is already similar in size to a typical RFID card, it is easy to extend the design by adding a lanyard hook to create an antenna that can be worn with a lanyard and look like a "real" badge. Adding the loop was a simple step in CAD once the general dimensions were known.

**Figure 18: Antenna with Lanyard Loop in CubePro**

The antenna was tuned using a similar process, and a black wire was run through a newly created hole in a black lanyard. The cable could come out at the top end with leads for the antenna, while the Hirose connector for the Proxmark3 remained in my pocket, out of sight. The cost of this model on Shapeways was $12.68, including shipping, and the quality was excellent, as shown in Figure 19.

### Clipwnd (Clipboard with a Kick)

This storage clipboard comes equipped with 3D-printed guide bars that hold the Proxmark3 and its accessories (including a USB battery pack) in position, ready to start stealing badge data. Adding embedded computers can enable more advanced functionality, supported via smartphone or by a third party overseeing the RFID hacking operation.

### Business Information Modeling (BIM), 3D Scanning, and RFID Hacking

3D printing opens up many possibilities for rapid prototyping of enclosures to make RFID hacking tools look like something else. The challenge, however, is accurately capturing the likeness of the intended object without detailed measurements or excellent artistic skills. Fortunately, there are resources available to simplify this problem. Building Information Models (BIMs) are a great example, with more manufacturers contributing 3D models of their products to simplify the construction process. Catalogs of these models are available for architects to pull into AutoCAD files via the Autodesk Seek BIM catalog. A simple Google search for 'DWG file repository' also reveals several other options for obtaining useful model data.

When a model is not available, other steps must be taken to generate one. Just a few years ago, this would generally mean purchasing a $1000+ desktop scanner or perhaps a digitizing arm.
