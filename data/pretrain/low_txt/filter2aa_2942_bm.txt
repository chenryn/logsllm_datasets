### Threats to the Supply Chain and Economic Risks

Economic risks in the supply chain can arise from various sources, including:
- **Failure of a Key Supplier:** The failure of a critical supplier can have significant economic repercussions.
- **Vulnerabilities to Cost Volatility:** Fluctuations in costs can lead to financial instability.
- **Reliance on Single-Source Suppliers:** Dependence on a single supplier increases the risk of disruptions.
- **Costs of Replacing Suspect Vendors:** Switching vendors can be expensive and time-consuming.
- **Resource Constraints Due to Company Size:** Smaller companies may face resource limitations that affect their ability to manage supply chain risks.

### Systemic Supply Disruptions

**Production Shortfalls in Rare Earth Metals:**
- **Impact:** Production shortfalls in rare earth metals can lead to supply shortages for critical inputs into semiconductors.
- **Cause:** Systemic and structural failures, especially when the source of supply is concentrated in a single geographical location.

**Environmental Disasters:**
- **Impact:** Geopolitical or natural disasters can disrupt the supply chain.
- **Cause:** The availability of key supply chain inputs is subject to disruptions from geopolitical upheavals or natural disasters, particularly when suppliers share a common fourth-party supplier.

**Structural Failures:**
- **Impact:** Inadequate capacity planning can lead to outages in cloud platforms.
- **Cause:** A vendor or supplier service without appropriate capacity controls can be disrupted by unexpected surges in resource demand.

- **Leveraged Document:** This report leveraged the 2015 version of the NIST SP 800-161.

### Threat Sources and Examples

**Accidental Threats:**
- **Example:** Configuration errors leading to data exposure.
- **Description:** Employees and contractors with access to information systems are prone to errors, especially if there are training lapses or process gaps.

### Supply Chain Cybersecurity Threat Considerations

**Level 1:**
- **Considerations:** Enterprise business and mission, strategic supplier relationships, geographical considerations.
- **Methods:** Establish common starting points for identifying threats, develop procedures for countering enterprise-wide threats.

**Level 2:**
- **Considerations:** Mission and business processes, geographic locations, types of suppliers, technologies used.
- **Methods:** Identify additional threat information, scope threat sources to specific missions and business processes, establish mission-specific preparatory procedures.

**Level 3:**
- **Considerations:** SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle).
- **Methods:** Base threat detail on the SDLC phase, identify and refine threat sources based on potential insertion within individual SDLC processes.

### Vulnerabilities

A vulnerability is a weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that can be exploited by a threat source. Within the C-SCRM context, it includes any weakness in the supply chain, provided services, system/component design, development, manufacturing, production, shipping, receiving, delivery, operation, and component end-of-life.

**Vulnerability Assumptions:**
- **Enterprise Level:** Long-term assumptions about weaknesses that can be exploited or triggered by a threat source.
- **Refinement:** These assumptions are refined and updated during the Assess step to reflect point-in-time variances.

**Vulnerability Manifestation:**
- **Level 1:** Susceptibilities due to managerial and operating structures, conditions in the supply chain, and characteristics of enterprise processes.
- **Level 2:** Specific to mission and business processes, resulting from operating structures and conditions.
- **Level 3:** Deficiencies or weaknesses in supplied products, SDLC, system security procedures, internal controls, system implementations, system inputs, or services.

### Supply Chain Cybersecurity Vulnerability Considerations

**Level 1:**
- **Considerations:** Enterprise mission and business, holistic supplier relationships, geographical considerations, enterprise and security architecture, criticality.
- **Methods:** Examine agency cybersecurity supply chain information, analyze mission susceptibility, review third-party provider relationships, and enterprise architecture.

**Level 2:**
- **Considerations:** Mission and business processes, geographic locations, supplier dependencies, technologies used.
- **Methods:** Refine analysis based on specific missions and business processes, use the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) to characterize and score vulnerabilities, prioritize vulnerabilities for remediation.

**Level 3:**
- **Considerations:** Individual technologies, solutions, and services, supply chain SDLC inputs.
- **Methods:** Refine analysis based on Level 2 inputs, use CVEs to characterize and categorize vulnerabilities, identify weaknesses.

### Impact and Harm

**Impact Definition:**
- **Definition:** The effect on enterprise operations, assets, individuals, other enterprises, or the Nation of a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or an information system.
- **Assumptions:** Long-term assumptions about the effects of different cybersecurity events, updated and refined during the Assess step.

**Impact and Harm Libraries:**
- **Purpose:** Capture standing assumptions about the impact or harm of different cybersecurity event types.
- **Categories:** Operational, environmental, individual safety, reputational, regulatory/legal fines and penalties, IT recovery/replacement, direct financial damage to critical infrastructure sectors.

**C-SCRM Consequences and Impact:**
- **Role:** Reflect the role of the availability, confidentiality, and integrity of supplier-provided products or services on the enterpriseâ€™s operations, assets, and individuals.
- **Examples:**
  - An earthquake in Malaysia reduces the world's supply of DRAM, creating a shortage for hardware maintenance and new design.
  - Accidental procurement of a counterfeit part results in premature component failure, impacting mission performance.

### Conclusion

Enterprises should leverage historical data, expert elicitation protocols, and both quantitative and qualitative methodologies to analyze and manage supply chain risks effectively. This comprehensive approach ensures that the enterprise is well-prepared to handle various threats and vulnerabilities across all levels of the organization.
