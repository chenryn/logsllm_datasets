### Direct Dependence on Weights for QoS Recomputation

The re-computation of Quality of Service (QoS) dimensions is directly dependent on the weights assigned to these dimensions. For the DNA Sequencing workflow, the specific weights used are detailed in Table 5. A higher weight associated with the multi-workflow function implies a faster approximation when the SWR algorithm is applied. The same principle applies to the instance workflow function.

### Related Work

While a significant amount of QoS research has been conducted in areas such as networking (Cruz 1995; Georgiadis, Guerin et al. 1996), real-time applications (Clark, Shenker et al. 1992), and middleware (Zinky, Bakken et al. 1997; Frolund and Koistinen 1998; Hiltunen, Schlichting et al. 2000), the literature on QoS for Workflow Management Systems (WfMS) is relatively limited. The Crossflow project (Klingemann, Wäsch et al. 1999; Damen, Derks et al. 2000; Grefen, Aberer et al. 2000) has made a notable contribution. In their approach, information from past workflow executions is collected in a log, from which a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) is derived. This CTMC is then used to calculate the time and cost associated with workflow executions. An estimation component provides QoS predictions for running workflow instances based on performance models given as CTMCs, produced by an offline monitoring component that analyzes past executions, and an online monitoring component.

Compared to the Crossflow project, our approach includes reliability as part of the QoS model. Our model allows for the computation of workflow QoS using two distinct methods: a mathematical and a simulation approach. The mathematical approach does not require the definition of distribution functions, making it simpler for business analysts and domain experts. The simulation approach, on the other hand, allows for the association of various distributions with workflow activities (Chandrasekaran, Silver et al. 2002). Unlike the Crossflow project, which is limited to exponential functions, our approach can utilize any distribution available in the simulation system.

### Time Management in WfMS

Although research on QoS for WfMS is limited, research on time management, a key aspect of workflow QoS, has been more active. Gillmann et al. (Gillmann, Weissenfels et al. 2000; Gillmann, Weikum et al. 2002) present a tool for configuring distributed workflow systems to meet specified goals for throughput, response time, availability, and performability. Their approach uses continuous-time Markov chains and Markov reward models to predict the performance, availability, and performability of a WfMS under a given load. The performance model estimates the throughput of workflow instances and the waiting time for service requests, while the availability model estimates the downtime of the WfMS given the failure and restart rates for the various components. The performability model predicts performance, taking into account temporarily non-available servers. This approach, like the Crossflow system, relies on Markov models.

Eder et al. (1999) and Pozewaunig et al. (1997) extend the Critical Path Method (CMP) and Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) frameworks by annotating workflow graphs with time. This allows for checking the validity of time constraints at process build-time and instantiation-time, and for taking preemptive actions at run-time. However, their approach is only applicable to directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), which is a significant limitation since many workflows include cyclic graphs. Cycles are generally used to represent rework actions or repetitive activities within a workflow. Our approach, in contrast, handles both acyclic and cyclic workflows.

Researchers at Ulm (Reichert and Dadam 1998; Dadam, Reichert et al. 2000) also recognize the importance of time in workflow execution. The ADEPT project includes the modeling of real-time deadline constraints and the consequences of missing deadlines during structural changes in a workflow instance. Each workflow task can specify minimal and maximal durations. The system supports the specification and monitoring of deadlines, notifying users when deadlines are likely to be missed. However, there is no provision for estimating QoS metrics. Bauer and Dadam (Bauer and Dadam 2000) also show how a distributed WfMS can be developed to minimize the communication load of the components at runtime. Their approach uses a cost model and a distribution algorithm to calculate appropriate variable server assignments at build time.

Chandra, Gong et al. (2003) use dynamic resource allocation techniques to provide guarantees for web applications running on shared data centers. Their system architecture combines online measurements with prediction and resource allocation techniques. This work can be integrated with our QoS model to compute, predict, and analyze the time dimensions of web services and workflows.

Marjanovic and Orlowska (1999) describe a workflow model enriched with constructs and algorithms for checking the consistency of temporal constraints. These constraints regulate the time component of a workflow and include task duration, deadline, and interdependent temporal constraints. The consistency of these constraints is verified at both build time and runtime. Their work focuses on managing workflow changes while accounting for temporal constraints but does not target the prediction of workflow execution duration.

### QoS Process Model

Other researchers have identified the need for a QoS process model. A good example is the DAML-S specification (Ankolekar, Burstein et al. 2001; DAML-S 2001), which semantically describes business processes, particularly in the composition of web services. The use of semantic information facilitates process interoperability between trading partners in e-commerce. The DAML-S specification includes constructs for specifying QoS parameters such as quality guarantees, quality ratings, and degrees of quality. However, the QoS model adopted by DAML-S needs significant improvement to provide a more functional solution for its users. One current limitation is the lack of a detailed set of classes and properties to represent QoS metrics. Extending the QoS model to include semantic concepts such as minimum, average, maximum, and distribution functions will enable the implementation of algorithms for the automatic computation of QoS metrics based on atomic tasks and sub-processes.

### Conclusions

The evaluation of e-commerce brings new challenges and requirements that need to be addressed. Many e-commerce applications are composed of web services forming workflows, and the composition of these workflows cannot ignore the importance of QoS measurements. Proper management of QoS specifications directly impacts the success of organizations participating in e-commerce and the evolution of e-commerce itself.

In this paper, we highlight the importance of QoS management for workflows and WfMSs and present a comprehensive QoS model. This model allows for the description of workflow components from a QoS perspective, including three dimensions: time, cost, and reliability. The use of QoS increases the added value of workflow systems to organizations by describing non-functional aspects of workflows. The model is predictive, allowing the automatic computation of the QoS of workflows based on the QoS of their components (tasks or web services). This feature is particularly important for large processes that may contain hundreds of tasks. We present a mathematical model that formally describes the formulae to compute QoS metrics among workflow tasks and develop an algorithm (SWR algorithm) to automatically compute the overall QoS of a workflow. The algorithm applies a set of reduction rules to a workflow until only one task remains, representing the QoS for the entire workflow.

### Implementation and Validation

We implemented the theoretical QoS model in the METEOR workflow management system to identify the challenges and difficulties in implementing QoS. Supporting QoS management requires the modification and extension of most workflow system components, including the enactment system, workflow builder, monitor, code generator, repository, workflow model, and task model. New components, such as a QoS estimator module, were also implemented to create QoS estimates for tasks and probabilities for transitions. The monitor was enhanced with an additional interface to propagate and log runtime task QoS metrics into a database for data processing.

To test the validity of the QoS model, SWR algorithm, and QoS implementation, we deployed a set of production workflows in the area of genetics at the Fungal Genome Resource laboratory. We executed workflow instances based on real data and collected and analyzed the generated QoS data. While the process itself was not made operational, the analysis indicates that the QoS model and algorithm provide a suitable framework for predicting and analyzing the QoS of production workflows.
