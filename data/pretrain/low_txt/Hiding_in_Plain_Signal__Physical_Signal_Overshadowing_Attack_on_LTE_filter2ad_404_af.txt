#### A. Impact on Quality of Service

We measure the impact of the SigOver attack on the quality of service, where malicious paging messages are transmitted at every subframe 9. This implies that legitimate subframes at subframe 9 are overshadowed and lost, while non-overshadowed legitimate subframes may also be affected by crafted subframes. Specifically, the reference signals (RS) of the crafted subframes perturb the channel estimation averaged among crafted and non-overshadowed legitimate subframes (in RRC Connected state), which may disturb equalization and introduce errors. Despite these factors, the impact of the SigOver attack is validated to be minimal, as demonstrated in this section under a range of common services: voice calls, web browsing, FTP download, and live streaming. We note that measurements were carried out under a reliable SigOver attack (>97% success rate) for the UE in the RRC Connected state.

**Figure 12: Call Jitter and Packet Loss**

- **Voice Call**: UEs camping on the LTE network use Voice over LTE (VoLTE) for call services. We evaluate the impact of the SigOver attack on key VoLTE performance metrics such as data rate, jitter, and packet loss. These metrics were measured before and after the attack for comparison. The data rate remained stable post-attack and is omitted for brevity. Figure 12 illustrates the jitter and packet loss. The jitter was consistently less than 10ms, and packet loss was mostly zero, sufficient to support high-quality call services [24]. This keeps the SigOver attack stealthy without degrading user experience.

**Figure 13: Webpage Loading Time**

- **Web Browsing**: We extended the measurements to web browsing, one of the most frequently used services. Specifically, we measured the time required to load multiple identical web pages with and without the attack. Figure 13 presents the results, with 'HTTP' representing the total duration of HTTP data exchange for page loading and 'Signaling' the time required for RRC connection establishment. Under the SigOver attack, the time from RRC connection initiation to webpage downloading was delayed by an average of only 80ms compared to the case without the attack. Previous studies [12] have shown that such a lag has a negligible impact on the quality of experience.

**Figure 14: FTP Throughput**

- **FTP Downloading**: Figure 14 reveals that FTP performance significantly differed under the SigOver attack. This is due to dynamically controlled modulation to overcome bit errors in communication. The SigOver attack introduces bit errors, forcing the UE to use a robust but lower-throughput QPSK modulation. Conversely, without the attack, the bit error is low, allowing the UE to use 64QAM, which supports higher throughput. However, this impact is less likely to be noticed by users, as FTP is rarely used on smartphones.

**Figure 15: YouTube Live Throughput**

- **Live Streaming**: Figure 15 shows the throughput of YouTube live streaming at a resolution of 1080p. Neither buffering nor interruption occurred under the SigOver attack during a 5-minute video clip. The live streaming result differs from FTP downloads, as the streaming throughput was not as high as FTP.
