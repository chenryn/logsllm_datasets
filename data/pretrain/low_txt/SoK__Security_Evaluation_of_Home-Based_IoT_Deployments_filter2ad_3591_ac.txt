### Vendors
Vendors often struggle with due diligence in the development, management, and deployment of heterogeneous technologies. Many vendors lack the comprehensive expertise required for these tasks. To address this, vendors can outsource specific areas to specialized third parties, thereby enhancing their product offerings.

### End-Users
Home-based IoT deployments transform simple home networks into complex, enterprise-like networks. End-users can enhance security by configuring devices to use encryption, disabling remote administration features, and segmenting their network. Most importantly, consumers can influence vendors by purchasing privacy-aware and secure devices. Our portal aims to provide an objective security assessment of IoT devices, enabling consumers to make informed decisions.

### Other Parties
#### Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
While ISPs are not direct stakeholders, the ubiquity of home-based IoT devices affects the operation of their networks. Much of the traffic seen by ISPs is encrypted, but they can identify devices by destinations, service ports, and communication frequency. ISPs can potentially implement technical remedies to block certain ports, but legal policies are necessary to intervene. These decisions can lead to policy and compliance disputes due to the global nature of IoT and international jurisprudence. ISPs can offer their expertise in running and operating residential Internet networks, which can help identify implications around home-based IoT deployments.

#### Cloud Providers
Cloud providers offer infrastructure-as-a-service to many IoT vendors, leveraging years of experience in developing, running, and securing cloud infrastructures and platforms. Their services are economical and practical for vendors, although they occasionally suffer from outages. Cloud providers play a crucial role in securing IoT deployments and should continue to offer tailored cloud services that alleviate security responsibilities from vendors.

### Recommendations

#### Measurements
We recommend additional measurements for inter-device communication, mobile application-to-device interaction, and trust relationships between IoT components. Inter-device communications within the LAN, such as those in home assist devices, often auto-discover and interact with other devices without user consent. This warrants further investigation to understand the security and privacy implications. Longitudinal studies can also expose latent flaws that are difficult to observe without temporal analysis.

#### Best Practices
Best practices and guidelines for IoT components are readily available, but their utilization is low. Some evaluated devices have excellent practices that other vendors can benefit from, including mobile application implementation, cloud service configuration, device provisioning, and secure deployment and interaction of components. These design and implementation patterns should be evaluated in-depth to understand their cost/benefits to vendors. Government legislation can encourage economic or policy-based incentives to influence vendors to adopt best practices.

#### Standards
Many well-established vendors have proposed standards for IoT systems, but there is no consensus in the community. Vendors and researchers should combine their expertise to jointly draft industry standards that address common mistakes found in home-based IoT systems. For IoT systems with cyber-physical components, such as connected ovens, fridges, and water heaters, safety mandates and code standards must be implemented to ensure no physical harm results from abuse or component failure. The government must play an active role in the development of these standards to protect consumer safety and privacy.

### Conclusion
This work systematized the existing literature on home-based IoT devices through an abstract model, allowing us to derive insights. We used the same methodology to evaluate 45 IoT devices and found that many of the issues discussed in the literature still exist in IoT systems today. Our results and evaluation dataset are available on our portal, and we invite researchers to contribute and reproduce our work. We envision this effort as a central pillar for evaluating home-based IoT devices, providing data for researchers, and collaborating with vendors.
