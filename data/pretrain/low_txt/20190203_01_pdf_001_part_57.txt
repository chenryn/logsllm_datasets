### Subscription Name
**Error:** The subscription `subscription_name` cannot be removed.  
**Reason:** The publication does not exist on the publication server.  
**Resolution:** A warning is issued if you attempt to remove a subscription that does not have an associated publication. You can still proceed with the removal of the subscription.

**Error:** The subscription database connection cannot be removed.  
**Reason:** One or more subscriptions are defined against it.  
**Resolution:** You cannot remove a subscription database definition if there are subordinate subscriptions. First, remove the associated subscriptions.

### Removing Subscriptions
**Error:** The subscription does not exist on the subscription service.  
**Reason:** It might have been removed by another user.  
**Resolution:** The subscription node you are trying to select no longer represents an existing subscription. This may be due to concurrent removal by another xDB Replication Console or xDB Replication Server CLI session. Click the Refresh icon in the xDB Replication Console toolbar to display the current replication tree.

### Subscription Service Connection Failure
**Error:** Subscription service connection failure.  
**Resolution:** Verify that the subscription server is running. See Section 10.3.4.2 for more details.

### Synchronization Process Failure
**Error:** 'Synchronize Publication' process failed for one or more master nodes.  
**Resolution:** Synchronization replication failed to complete for all target databases in the multi-master replication system due to the unavailability of some target databases. Check the publication server log file for details. See Section 10.3.2.

### Large Object Type PK Attribute
**Error:** A table with a large object type PK attribute cannot be published for incremental replication.  
**Resolution:** Oracle does not log changes for a large object column. Such a column cannot be referenced in the triggers that log changes to the shadow tables. Use snapshot-only replication instead.

### Database Connection Test Failures
**Error:** Database connection information test failed.  
**Reason:** Connection refused.  
**Resolution:** Verify that the hostname and port are correct and that the postmaster is accepting TCP/IP connections. This error occurs when testing the connection of a publication or subscription database definition. Ensure the correct IP address and port for the database server are provided, and that the database server is running and accessible from the host running the publication or subscription server.

**Error:** FATAL: no pg_hba.conf entry for host "xxx.xxx.xx.xxx", user "user_name", database "db_name", SSL off.  
**Resolution:** Verify that the database host IP address, port number, database user name, password, and database identifier are correct. Ensure there is an entry in the `pg_hba.conf` file permitting access to the database by the given user name originating from the IP address where the publication or subscription server is running.

**Error:** IO exception: The Network Adapter could not establish the connection.  
**Resolution:** Verify that the database server is running. For Oracle, ensure that the Oracle listener program `lsnrctl` is running.

### WAL-Based Logical Replication
**Error:** The target database server cannot be registered for WAL-based logical replication.  
**Reason:** The database server is not configured for logical replication.  
**Resolution:** 
- **FATAL: must be superuser or replication role to start walsender.**
  - Grant the publication database user the appropriate privilege (superuser or REPLICATION) or specify a different database user who has the appropriate privilege for logical replication.
  - See Section 2.2.10 for more details.

- **FATAL: no pg_hba.conf entry for replication connection from host "xxx.xxx.xx.xxx", user "user_name", SSL off.**
  - Ensure the `pg_hba.conf` file contains a replication entry for the specified user name.
  - See Section 2.2.10 for more details.

- **FATAL: number of requested standby connections exceeds max_wal_senders (currently n).**
  - Increase the value of `max_wal_senders` in the `postgresql.conf` file and restart the database server.
  - See Section 2.2.10 for more details.

- **Target database server version x.x does not support WAL logical decoding.**
  - Only PostgreSQL versions 9.4 or later support WAL-based logical replication.
  - See Section 2.2.10 for more details.

### DDL Changes
**Error:** Unable to apply DDL changes.  
**Resolution:** The DDL statements in the text file contain syntax errors or are not supported by the DDL change replication feature. See Section 7.8 for more details.

### Communication with Remote Server
**Error:** Unable to communicate with remote server.  
**Resolution:** Verify that the publication and/or subscription servers are running and that the database servers of the publication and/or subscription databases are running.

### Schema Table Creation
**Error:** Unable to create schema tables in the target master database, publication shadow tables, or subscription schema tables.  
**Resolution:** 
- **com.edb.util.PSQLException: ERROR: permission denied for relation pg_class.**
  - The publication database user of the new publication database must be a superuser, and the `rolcatupdate` column in the `pg_catalog.pg_authid` table must be set to true for this superuser.
  - See Section 10.4.4 for more details.

- **Connection rejected: FATAL: no pg_hba.conf entry for host "xxx.xxx.xx.xxx" user "user_name", database "db_name", SSL off.**
  - Verify that the `pg_hba.conf` file on the controller or publication database server permits access from the subscription server host.

- **The database type is not supported.**
  - The subscription database type is not supported for the intended publication database type. See Section 10.1.3.2 for a list of permitted source and target database server configurations.

- **The target database schema already contains one or more tables with the same name as the table(s) in the source database.**
  - Drop the existing tables in the target schema before creating the subscription again.

### Snapshot Replication
**Error:** Unable to perform snapshot for subscription `subscription_name`.  
**Resolution:** 
- **com.edb.util.PSQLException: ERROR: permission denied for relation pg_class.**
  - The database user receiving the snapshot must be a superuser, and the `rolcatupdate` column in the `pg_catalog.pg_authid` table must be set to true for this superuser.
  - See Section 10.4.4 for more details.

- **org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: FATAL: no pg_hba.conf entry for host "xxx.xxx.xx.xxx", user "user_name", database "db_name", SSL off.**
  - Verify that the `pg_hba.conf` file on the subscription database server permits access from the publication server host.

### Synchronization
**Error:** Unable to synchronize.  
**Reason:** FATAL: no pg_hba.conf entry for host "xxx.xxx.xx.xxx", user "user_name", database "db_name", SSL off.  
**Resolution:** Verify that the `pg_hba.conf` file on the subscription server permits access from the publication server host using the network address `xxx.xxx.xx.xxx`.

### Publication Database Information
**Error:** Unable to update publication database information.  
**Reason:** The publication control schema does not exist on the target database.  
**Resolution:** The control schema objects in the publication database may have been deleted or corrupted. For Oracle, the control schema objects are located in the publication database user’s schema. For PostgreSQL or SQL Server, the metadata database objects are located in schemas `_edb_replicator_pub`, `_edb_replicator_sub`, and `_edb_scheduler`. See Section 10.3.4.3 for more details.

### Insufficient Privileges
**Error:** The user has insufficient privileges to manage publications.  
**Resolution:** An Oracle publication database user must have `CONNECT`, `RESOURCE`, and `CREATE ANY TRIGGER` privileges.

### Common Problem Checklist
1. **Verify that the database servers of the publication, subscription, and master nodes are running.**
2. **Click the Refresh icon in the xDB Replication Console to view the most current information.**
3. **Ensure the publication and subscription servers are running.** If they are not, see Section 10.3.4.2.
4. **If using an Oracle database, verify the Oracle JDBC driver file is copied to the `XDB_HOME/lib/jdbc` directory.** See Section 5.1.3.1.
5. **Grant necessary privileges to the publication database user.**
   - **Oracle:** `CONNECT`, `RESOURCE`, and `CREATE ANY TRIGGER` privileges. See Section 5.1.4.1.
   - **SQL Server:**
     - In the `msdb` database, verify the database user has `EXECUTE` and `SELECT` privileges on schema `dbo`.
     - In the publication database, verify the default schema is set to the schema containing the xDB Replication Server metadata database objects.
     - Ensure the database user has `ALTER`, `EXECUTE`, `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` privileges on the metadata schema.
     - Ensure the database user has `CREATE TABLE` and `CREATE PROCEDURE` privileges.
     - Ensure the database user has `ALTER` privilege on the publication tables.
     - Ensure any database user updating the publication tables has `EXECUTE`, `SELECT`, and `INSERT` privileges on the metadata schema.
     - See Section 5.1.4.2 for more details.
