# May 2022 Deployment Notice - Microsoft Trusted Root Program

On Tuesday, May 17, 2022, Microsoft released an update to the Microsoft Trusted Root Certificate Program. This update includes the removal of the following root certificate:

- **U.S. Federal Public Key Infrastructure (US FPKI)**
  - **Common Name:** U.S. Government Common Policy
  - **SHA-1 Thumbprint:** 905F942FD9F28F679B378180FD4F846347F645C1

### Additional Notes

- As part of this release, Microsoft updated the Untrusted CTL (Certificate Trust List) timestamp and sequence number. The content of the Untrusted CTL remains unchanged, but this update will prompt your system to download or refresh the Untrusted CTL. This is a standard procedure that may occur when the Trusted Root CTL is updated.
  
- The update package is available for download and testing at [this link](#).

- Signatures on the Certificate Trust Lists (CTLs) for the Microsoft Trusted Root Program have been changed from dual-signed (SHA-1/SHA-2) to SHA-2 only. No action is required from customers. For more information, please visit [this page](#).

If you have any questions or need further assistance, please contact Microsoft Support.
