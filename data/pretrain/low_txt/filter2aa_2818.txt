### Introduction

### What is Red Teaming?
Red teaming originated in the military to test the security of "friendly" installations. These professionals simulate attacks to identify vulnerabilities, often leaving evidence such as fake "bomb" signs or notes indicating stolen codebooks. In the computer industry, red teams test the security of systems through simulated attacks.

**Why Conduct Red Team Testing?**
- **Real-world Test:** Simulates a highly skilled, motivated, and funded attacker.
- **Converged Attack Surface:** Covers electronic, physical, and social vectors.
- **Immediate Impact Assessment:** Demonstrates maximum potential damage.
- **Full DR Test:** Evaluates the entire information security program.

**Types of Convergence:**
- **Electronic-Physical (EP):** Attacks on network-enabled physical systems.
- **Electronic-Social (ES):** Phishing, profiling, creating moles, and blackmail.
- **Physical-Social (PS):** Tailgating, impersonation, and other physical breaches.

### Traditional Attacks and Techniques
- **Tailgating**
- **Lock Picking**
- **Shimming**
- **Key Bumping**
- **Under Door Hooks (K22)**
- **Lock Bypass**
- **Elevator Keys**

### RFID Overview
- **RFID Tag Frequencies**
- **Who Uses It?**
  - Legacy 125-kilohertz proximity technology is still prevalent in 70-80% of physical access control deployments in the U.S.
- **Who is Vulnerable?**
  - Government facilities
  - Medical facilities
  - Financial institutions
  - Nuclear facilities
  - Power/water facilities
  - Educational institutions
  - And many more...

### Understanding Badge Systems
- **Read Ranges**
- **Wiegand Protocol**
- **Internet and eBay Reseller Services**

### RFID Hacking
- **Cloning/Replay (Low Frequency, Prox II)**
  - **Demo:** Low Freq Clone/Replay using Proxmark III
- **Privilege Escalation - Prox Brute**
- **Long Range Reading (Low Frequency)**
  - **Demo:** Long Range Tastic Reader (Low Frequency)

### Advanced RFID Attacks
- **Long Range Reading (High Frequency, iCLASS)**
  - **Demo:** Arduino with LCD, Mobile Reader PCB Build
- **iCLASS Vulnerability (Public)**
  - **Heart of Darkness:** Exploring HID iCLASS security
  - **Firmware Dump and Encryption Key Compromise:** 27th Chaos Communication Congress, December 2010
- **iCLASS Card Cloning**
  - **Demo:** iClass Cloning
- **iCLASS Privilege Escalation**
  - **Block 7:** Contains encrypted format of facility code and access card number
  - **Use Compromised Keys:** Calculate new block 7 for Weigand data string
  - **Write Block 7 to Clone Card**
  - **Badge In!**
  - **Work in Progress:** iClass brute
  - **Demo:** iClass Priv Esc

### Blended Attacks
- **Information Leak from Badge System**
- **Remote Compromise of Access Controls**
- **Monitoring Activity**
- **Identifying System Faults**
- **Profiling**
- **Access Rights Modification**

### Under Development
- **Bio and PIN Attacks**
- **Mesh Network**
  - **Real-Time Mesh Network:** Collaboration of multiple Red Team members and field hardware
- **Backdoored Reader**
  - **Backdoored Reader with Arduino:** Captures Wiegand data and transmits over Zigbee or Wi-Fi to other Red Team member’s hardware device in the field

### Remediation and Risk Mitigation
- **Standard RFID Asset Protection and Best Practices**
- **Protection Strategies for Badge Systems (Physical and Electronic)**
- **Protection Against Blended Threats and Red Team Targeted Attacks**
- **Custom Card Formats and Time to Reverse (TTR)**
- **Protect Badge Systems with VLANs, 2-Factor Authentication, or Isolation**
- **Training for Staff and Guards**
- **Log Monitoring (IPS?)**
