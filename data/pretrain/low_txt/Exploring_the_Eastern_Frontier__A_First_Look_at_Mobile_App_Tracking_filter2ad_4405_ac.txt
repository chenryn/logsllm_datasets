### Specialization Index (TSI) for Measuring ATS Local Community Focus

To measure the extent to which an App Tracking System (ATS) local community is dedicated to a specific app category, we introduce the Tracker Specialization Index (TSI). The TSI is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{TSI} = \frac{|U(a) \cap U(b)|}{|U(a)|}
\]

where \( U(a) \) and \( U(b) \) are the sets of trackers in the ATS local community \( a \) and app category \( b \), respectively.

### Distribution of TSI for Non-Popular Tracker Communities

In Figure 5, we plot the distribution of the TSI for 56 non-popular tracker communities. Our observations indicate that ATS local communities tend to be specialized in one or two app categories, with a TSI of at least 0.5. This suggests that these communities provide specialized tracking services relevant to particular apps. For example, Education apps are predominantly tracked by ATS local communities run by companies that provide educational services. Specifically, the parenting app Yaolan is primarily tracked by ATS local communities run by Yaolan itself and PCbaby, both of which offer parenting or educational services.

### Interconnectedness and Specialization of Mobile Trackers

Mobile trackers are interconnected because popular trackers frequently co-occur with non-popular ones within the same apps. However, non-popular trackers form many local communities, each of which tends to track a specific category of mobile apps. The top ATSes are often found in the same app, indicating pervasive tracking.

### User Impact of ATSes

#### ATS Monopolies

The heavy-tailed distribution of ATS popularity suggests that some may have a monopoly on certain users' data. To investigate this, we compute two metrics:

1. **User Tracking Potential (UTP)**: Measures the number of users that can potentially be tracked by a mobile tracker. Given the set of all mobile users \( R \), where \( S_i \subset R \) is the set of users that tracker \( i \) can reach, the UTP for tracker \( i \) is:
   \[
   \text{UTP}_i = \frac{|S_i|}{|R|}
   \]

2. **Tracking Monopoly Index (TMI)**: Measures the extent to which a tracker reaches users that others do not. Let \( m_j \) denote the number of mobile trackers that can reach user \( j \in S_i \). The TMI for tracker \( i \) is:
   \[
   \text{TMI}_i = \frac{1}{|S_i|} \sum_{j \in S_i} \frac{1}{m_j}
   \]
   A high TMI indicates that some users are exclusively reached by the tracker, possibly due to its high prevalence or specific coverage of mobile users.

Figure 6 shows the distribution of UTP and TMI for the top 30 ATS domains (SLDs). We rank the tracker domains in descending order by UTP values. The results reveal a high penetration of tech giants in China. For instance, qq.com (owned by Tencent) has a high UTP (over 0.8) and TMI (about 0.3), indicating its high popularity and tracking monopoly. Additionally, although less than 20% of mobile users are tracked by 71.am (Baidu), uc.cn (Alibaba), and 360.cn (360 Security), these trackers have relatively high TMIs, suggesting significant pooling of tracker data within this small elite, similar to Google and Facebook in the Western context.

#### Traffic Volume and Privacy Implications

Regardless of privacy implications, the data sent to trackers increases resource usage on devices and within the network. We compute the ratio of tracking traffic to app traffic for individual users and plot the distribution in Figure 7. The median ratio is around 1%, but 5% of users send over 10% of their traffic to trackers. This ratio is lower than that observed in an equivalent European 3G ISP, possibly due to the pervasive availability of online videos (used by 57% of users) in the 4G network. Interestingly, iOS users (median 0.9%) tend to send less data to trackers than Android users (median 1.5%).

#### PII Leakage in ATS and Regional Destination

We explore whether personally identifiable information (PII) is uploaded to ATS domains. We process each URL from all user access logs in our dataset to test for the presence of any PII using regular expressions to detect common UIDs on mobile devices (e.g., `*?imei=*` or `*&imei=*`). Table 3 summarizes the UIDs we check for, as inspired by previous studies. All collected UIDs are anonymized to protect user privacy.

To validate the inferred UID exposure, we use a small dataset of about 10,000 access logs collected at our lab's wireless access point for one day. Each log contains similar information to the ones used in this paper. Our analysis shows that 80% of identified IMEIs, 95% of IMSIs, 83% of MACs, and 92% of ADIDs/IDFAs indeed contain PII.

Our analysis reveals a concerning volume of PII leakage: up to 10% of users send their PII to trackers via their mobile apps. Figure 8 shows the distribution of how several popular tracker SLDs receive PII from apps. For each ATS domain, the percentage on the left represents the number of flows that contain UIDs, and the percentage on the right represents the number of flows that belong to each type of PII. IMEI, IMSI, and MAC are equally likely to be collected by these trackers. The ATSes that upload the largest volume of PII are letv.com (ad online video service) and sohu.com (a mixture of services including ads and video): 60% of PII-relevant flows belong to them. Each ATS shows clear preferences towards certain PII (shown in Figure 8). For instance, letv.com mainly collects IMSI and MAC information, while sohu.com shows balanced interests across four types of PII. In contrast, ICCID is only accessed by 360.cn (security service).

A particular concern is whether PII is sent across borders to other countries or regions. We find that more than 90% of PII tracking flows are within mainland China, driven by the predominance of Chinese ATSes and the blocking of several key US trackers (e.g., Google, Facebook), as well as the extensive support for HTTPS in most Western countries (which is excluded from our analysis).

### Takeaways

- Several tech giants in China track the majority of users.
- Some specialized trackers, while having relatively small user coverage, track specific groups of users that others do not.
- For 5% of users, 10% of their traffic is attributable to ATS flows.
- 10% of users are exposed to PII leakage.
- Nevertheless, 90% of the PII data is local to China.

### Conclusion and Discussion

This paper provides insights into the distinctive mobile tracking behavior in China. We make several interesting observations regarding ATS popularity and community structure, user monopoly patterns, and PII collection. This study not only validates many previous findings but also facilitates fresh analysis of tracking behavior in China. Our first look at China’s mobile tracking patterns has significant implications for various stakeholders in the mobile tracking community, such as app vendors, tracker providers, and adblockers. For instance, adblockers can leverage the community structure for new tracker detection, and the prevalence of cross-app tracking raises serious privacy concerns. Many of the findings are worth further exploration, such as tracker detection, PII collection, and the business relationships between mobile trackers.
