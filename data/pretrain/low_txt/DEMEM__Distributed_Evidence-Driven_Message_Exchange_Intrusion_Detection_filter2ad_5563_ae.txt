**The Next Messages: Lasting T.I.**

- **Definition and Generation**: The subsequent messages are referred to as "lasting T.I." (Transient Information). It is important to note that C2 does not generate T.I. (see Section 5.7).
- **False Positives**: If the duration of lasting T.I. exceeds the alarm thresholds, it is classified as a false positive. Figure 11 illustrates the average and maximum T.I. for C1 and C3. The alert threshold is set at 16 seconds for C1 and 15 seconds for C3.
- **False Positive Rate**: In a topology with 150 nodes and the highest mobility (maximum node speed of 20 m/s and 0 pause time), up to 3 false positives can occur. With approximately 6000 Hello messages generated, the false positive rate is at most 0.05% on average and 0.01% in total. By increasing the threshold to 20 seconds for C1, the false positive rate can be reduced to nearly zero. Thus, some 150-node topologies may experience a few false positives in C1, while others will have no false positives in both C1 and C3.

**Detection Latency**

- **ID-Evidence Message Waiting Time**: Figure 12 shows the average and maximum waiting times for ID-Evidence messages. The maximum waiting time is around 13 seconds, which is less than the alert thresholds for C1 and C3. Generally, the waiting time is shorter than the lasting T.I. time for C1 and C3, resulting in lower detection latency for C2 compared to C1 and C3.
- **Average Detection Latency**: The average detection latency for C2 is 6 seconds. For C1 and C3, if fixed to their respective alarm thresholds, the detection latencies are 16 and 15 seconds, respectively.

**Results with High Mobility**

- **Highest Mobility**: The results in Figures 11 and 12 are based on the highest mobility (maximum 20 m/s with no pause time). Topologies with fewer nodes or lower mobility (e.g., half node speed or higher pause time) exhibit slightly lower average T.I. lasting times but have fewer chances of experiencing longer maximum T.I. durations. Therefore, these topologies can have lower alarm thresholds for C1 and C3 (as low as 10 seconds).
- **Lower Detection Latency**: Additionally, such topologies also have lower ID-Evidence message waiting times, leading to lower detection latency.

**Stable Topology (Mesh Network)**

- **Definition and Performance**: When nodes in a Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) do not move, the network is called a Mesh network. DEMEM in OLSR performs significantly better in a Mesh network. The message overhead ranges from 0.5% (for 150 nodes) to 3% (for 10 nodes). As the number of nodes increases, the message overhead decreases because the number of forwarded TC messages grows more than the number of ID messages.
- **T.I. Duration and Alarm Thresholds**: For detection accuracy, C1's T.I. lasts at most 4 seconds, and C3's T.I. lasts 5 seconds. The alarm thresholds for C1 and C3 can be reduced to 6 seconds, eliminating false positives and negatives. The ID-Evidence message waiting time, which is also the detection latency for C2, is at most 4 seconds and 2 seconds on average. The detection latency for C1 and C3 is their reduced alarm threshold of 6 seconds. Thus, DEMEM in OLSR demonstrates excellent performance in stable topologies.

**Ongoing Work**

**DEMEM in AODV and DSR with TESLA**

- **Reactive vs. Proactive Protocols**: Reactive protocols (e.g., AODV and DSR) typically generate fewer routing messages than proactive protocols (e.g., OLSR), which use periodic routing messages. Reactive protocols also have smaller message sizes and provide less routing information, potentially leading to higher message overhead in IDS.
- **Challenges in Reactive Protocols**: In reactive protocols, the receiver of a broadcast routing message cannot determine the complete set of nodes that received the same message. This makes it challenging to trace the routing impact and validate other related messages, especially RREP messages from intermediate nodes.
- **Planned Adaptations**: We plan to adapt the "Previous Node" approach [11] as evidence for DEMEM in reactive protocols. For example, in AODV, "Evidence" includes the Sequence Number and Hop Count of a routing message. When a node receives an RREQ message, it buffers the sequence number and hop count along with the sender's address as an "Evidence certificate." This certificate is included when forwarding the RREQ message to prevent forgery.
- **TESLA Authentication**: We will use TESLA to authenticate the certificates and develop a hop count authentication algorithm and ID messages to manage TESLA keys. AODV will be our primary focus due to its popularity, and we may also implement DEMEM in DSR using a similar approach. Performance will be evaluated using the four metrics from Section 6.2.
- **Additional Benefits**: This work can also authenticate forwarded messages, such as TC messages in OLSR, addressing attack method 4 in Section 5.1 and the second assumption in Section 5.2.

**Reputation-Based Cooperative Intrusion Response Model**

- **Current Model**: In DEMEM, each node independently determines attacks and raises alerts. We plan to develop a cooperative intrusion response model [23] to establish trust management among nodes.
- **Reputation Algorithm**: A reputation-based algorithm will track security constraint violations to calculate the credit of neighbors. When a node detects a new violation, it can perform appropriate and advanced intrusion responses based on the neighbor's credit.
- **Voting Mechanism**: A voting mechanism will be developed to justify intrusion alerts. If a node raises an alert against a malicious neighbor, other neighbors of the malicious node may also raise the same alert, especially if the malicious node has broadcasted a forged routing message. This mechanism can reduce false positives and forged alerts.
- **Integration and Future Work**: This work will complement DEMEM, and we plan to integrate it into a new complete intrusion detection and response framework for MANET. We will also develop packet dropping attack detection to handle this attack better in the response model and resolve the third assumption in Section 5.2.

**DEMEM in TBRPF**

- **Proactive Routing Protocol**: TBRPF, like OLSR, is a proactive routing protocol in MANET. TBRPF uses "Source Trees" to calculate routing tables, and nodes exchange partial source trees to establish and update their complete source tree.
- **Implementation Steps**: First, we will extract critical values as evidence in DEMEM. Second, we will develop detection constraints to validate TBRPF routing messages. Third, we will develop ID messages to exchange the required new evidence for message validation.
- **Performance Expectations**: Since TBRPF is similar to OLSR, the structure of DEMEM in TBRPF should be similar to that in OLSR. TBRPF does not have flooding messages, so the detectors do not need to authenticate flooding messages as in OLSR. Therefore, the performance of DEMEM in TBRPF is expected to be similar to that in OLSR.

**Conclusion**

- **Scalability and Effectiveness**: DEMEM is a scalable and effective model due to its local message exchange and local intrusion detection mechanism, which does not modify the original protocol. DEMEM uses ID messages and five ID managers to provide sufficient evidence and perform intrusion detection with low message overhead.
- **OLSR Implementation**: DEMEM implementation in OLSR successfully detects OLSR routing attacks using three new ID messages: ID-Evidence, ID-Forward, and ID-Request. The example scenario details the detection process.
- **Performance Metrics**: The experiment's four performance metrics show that DEMEM can detect OLSR attacks with low message overhead, low detection delay, very low false positives, and no false negatives under message loss and mobility conditions. The metrics demonstrate even better results in a no-mobility situation.
- **Future Work**: We have discussed several ongoing works, including implementing DEMEM in other protocols (AODV, DSR, TBRPF) and developing a sophisticated reputation-based intrusion response model to further improve DEMEM.
