### 3.7 IPv4 and IPv6 Topology Analysis

**Figure 7: Average AS Path Lengths in IPv4 and IPv6**

- **IPv4**: The average AS path length has remained nearly constant over the years.
- **IPv6**: The average AS path length has shown a decreasing trend.

**Figure 8: Presence of ASes in IPv6 Graph by Business Type and Geographical Region**

- **Data Points**: 
  - **EC (Edge Carriers)**: Less than 10% are present in the IPv6 graph.
  - **LTP (Large Transit Providers)**: Approximately 90% are present in the IPv6 graph.
  - **STP (Small Transit Providers)** and **CAHP (Content and Hosting Providers)**: Intermediate presence in the IPv6 graph.

**IPv4 Address Depletion**
- Reports indicated that APNIC was the first to run out of allocatable IPv4 addresses, followed closely by RIPE and ARIN [22].

**ASes Unique to the IPv6 Topology**
- In our latest topology snapshot from October 2011, 109 ASes were exclusive to the IPv6 topology.
  - **42 ASes**: Previously present in the IPv4 topology, allowing us to assign business types.
  - **67 ASes**: Further inspection revealed that 27 could be matched with similar ASes in the IPv4 topology, suggesting separate ASes for IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity.
  - **2 ASes**: Administered by universities using IPv4 address space announced from national research and education networks.

**Common Top ASes**
- We measured the fraction of top-K ASes (in terms of AS degree) from the IPv4 topology that also appear as top-K ASes in the IPv6 topology.
- **Trend**: This fraction increased from around 20% in 2003 to more than 60% currently.
- **Key Observations**:
  - Until 2008, the top-10 ASes in IPv4 were less likely to be among the top-10 in IPv6.
  - Since 2008, the difference has decreased, with 60% of the top-10 ASes in IPv4 now also being in the top-10 for IPv6.

**Common AS Links**
- We analyzed the common set of AS links between the IPv4 and IPv6 topologies.
- **Visibility Issues**: Our BGP vantage points may miss some AS links, but this should affect both IPv4 and IPv6 graphs similarly.
- **Fraction of AS Links**:
  - Overall, less than 20% of AS links from the combined topology are present in the IPv6 topology.
  - **Business Types**:
    - **ECs (Edge Carriers)**: Least represented in the IPv6 graph.
    - **STPs, LTPs, and CAHPs**: Higher fractions of these links are seen in the IPv6 graph.
  - This is consistent with the finding that IPv6 adoption is higher in the core of the network but lags at the edge.

### 6. Evolving Dynamics of IPv4 and IPv6 Infrastructure

**Hypothesis**: As the IPv6 network matures, it should increasingly resemble the IPv4 network in terms of routing dynamics.

**Metrics Analyzed**:
- **Update Churn**: Rate of BGP updates received from a vantage point.
- **Correlation Between Vantage Points**: Measure of network maturity and business relationships.
- **Path Exploration and Convergence Times**: Impact on end-to-end delays and loss rates during routing events.

**Churn as a Function of Topology Size and Vantage Point**
- **Interdomain Routing Scalability**:
  - Concerns include increasing routing table size and BGP update rate.
  - Previous studies showed that churn in IPv4 grows slowly and at the same rate as the underlying topology.
  - Recent observations by Huston [28] suggest that IPv6 churn is increasing exponentially, raising questions about fundamental differences in routing dynamics.

**Churn Evolution**
- **IPv6**: Stable at approximately 3 updates per origin AS since January 2004, except for the AT&T monitor which sees half that many.
- **IPv4**: Stabilized at approximately 5 updates per origin AS by 2006, with exceptions for the AT&T and NTT monitors.

**Conclusion**
- The evolving dynamics of IPv4 and IPv6 infrastructure show that while IPv6 is maturing, there are still significant differences in routing behavior and adoption rates across different parts of the network.
