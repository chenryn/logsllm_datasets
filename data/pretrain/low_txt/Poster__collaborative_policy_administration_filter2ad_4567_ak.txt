### Governments Should Promote Public Innovation Spaces

Governments should consider promoting the creation of "public innovation spaces" where professionals from diverse backgrounds—such as design, economics, policy, and social sciences—can collaborate in a more horizontal, non-hierarchical manner. In these spaces, different forms of expertise can complement each other, rather than one form of knowledge dictating how others operate.

### 1. Context

During the 2012-2013 academic year, design students from MAD Faculty in Genk, Belgium, along with students from 7 other design schools in the EU Meuse-Rhine region, participated in the "Welcome to Saint-Gilles" project. Initiated by Reciprocity (Liège’s International Design Biennial) and supported by Wallonie Design and Recentre, the project aimed to create small design interventions to meet the social needs of residents in the Saint-Gilles neighborhood in Liège, Belgium. For many students, this was their first experience with design for social innovation.

This chapter shares lessons learned about the design process, stakeholder roles, and general points of attention, building on insights gained from the "Welcome to Saint-Gilles" project and similar initiatives.

### 2. Seven Reflections

#### 2.1 Managing Expectations

**Quote**: "To expect the unexpected shows a thoroughly modern intellect." — Oscar Wilde

In projects involving multiple stakeholders, such as students, educators, residents, local policymakers, and civil servants, the perception of success often depends on how well expectations are managed. Each stakeholder has unique expectations shaped by their context and agenda. Educators aim to guide the learning process, students seek to learn and achieve good grades, policymakers want qualitative results, and residents expect practical solutions. Meeting all these expectations is challenging, so it is crucial to make them explicit, discuss them, and set realistic goals early in the process. Project coordinators must facilitate these discussions to find a balance and provide clarity.

As stakeholders express their expectations, it becomes clearer how these relate to levels of ambition and engagement. For example, high expectations and vested interests from local policymakers can motivate students and residents to be more engaged. Conversely, if teachers emphasize learning over practical outcomes, residents may feel their problems are not being taken seriously, leading to disengagement. Understanding these dynamics can help fine-tune the design process.

In the "Welcome to Saint-Gilles" project, it was made clear early on that the results would be "seeds" of social innovation requiring further care and investment from the local community. While the student projects inspired the community, residents understood that their involvement was crucial for success.

#### 2.2 Managing Momentum

**Quote**: "It might be true that it is 'quality time' that counts, but after a certain point quantity has a bearing on quality." — Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi

From a project perspective, activities have a clear beginning and end, with a focus on delivering a solution. However, in a participatory setting, the process component is equally important. Momentum, which is closely linked to stakeholder engagement, is a key factor. Stakeholders feel more engaged when they see progress, are invited to participate, and feel part of making change happen.

Momentum and engagement are influenced by factors such as communication frequency and quality, depth of stakeholder involvement, progress, and a sense of ownership. Project coordinators must build and manage momentum throughout the project, adjusting it as needed to align with project goals.

In "Welcome to Saint-Gilles," momentum fluctuated. During the research phase, the streets were bustling with student activities, while later phases, focused on prototyping, were quieter. Limited contact with residents led to some fatigue, particularly among those repeatedly interviewed. By the project's end, an exhibition featuring 80 ideas to revitalize the neighborhood generated enthusiasm, but concerns arose about sustaining momentum once the students left. The responsibility of the designer extends beyond delivering results; it includes ensuring that the enthusiasm and hopes of stakeholders are carried forward.

### Conclusion

The "Welcome to Saint-Gilles" project highlights the importance of managing expectations and momentum in participatory design for social innovation. By understanding and addressing the needs and perspectives of all stakeholders, designers can create more effective and sustainable solutions.
