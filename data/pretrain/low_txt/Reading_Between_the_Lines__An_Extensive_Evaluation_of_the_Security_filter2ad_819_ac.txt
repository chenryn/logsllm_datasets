### Background Tasks and Time Limits

Official documentation does not specify the exact time an application is allowed to run in the background on iOS. However, an Apple staff member has stated on the official Apple Developer Forums that this period is approximately three minutes after the app loses focus [10]. Similarly, for Android, the exact time limit is undocumented, but it is generally believed to be around ten minutes before the application is forced into idle mode [7]. EPUB reading systems can leverage this functionality to remain active when switched to the background, thereby extending the window of potential security vulnerabilities. By embedding a counter within the EPUB, we can detect whether switching to the background pauses the execution of embedded JavaScript.

### Evaluated EPUB Reading Systems

We used a testbed to evaluate 92 free EPUB reading systems available on various platforms, including desktop (Windows 10, macOS 10.14.6, and Linux Ubuntu 18.04), mobile (iOS 12 and Android 9), and as browser extensions (Chrome 78 and Firefox 70). We selected and installed these reading systems from the iOS App Store, Google Play Store, Chrome Web Store, and Firefox Add-on Store. The selection was based on search results using the terms "epub reader" and "ebook reader," scanning the first 100 results each time. For Android, we only included applications with at least 5,000 downloads. For desktop platforms, we used web search engines and curated lists to select and install the applications, either by downloading them from websites or through the respective platform's application store. Additionally, we evaluated Kindle applications by converting the EPUBs to AZW e-books. A complete list of all evaluated EPUB reading systems is provided in Appendix A.

We also tested five popular physical e-reader devices: Kindle Paperwhite 4, PocketBook Touch HD 3, Kobo Clara HD, Onyx Nova Pro, and Tolino Shine 3. Their pre-installed EPUB rendering applications were evaluated out-of-the-box.

### Results

This section presents the results obtained from the semi-automated evaluation described earlier. Some reading systems were unable to render a perfectly compliant EPUB 3.2 e-book and were therefore excluded from our evaluation (see Appendix A).

#### Desktop Platforms

**Windows 10 (17763):**
- **Table I** shows the results for 15 reading systems on Windows.
- Five systems execute embedded JavaScript, which can be exploited to leak the existence of certain files. Two of these systems can even leak file contents.
- Calibre 3 and MS Edge allow EPUBs to open third-party applications, though only MS Edge requests user consent.
- Adobe Digital Editions' behavior differs between local and network files. It allows EPUBs to render images from local files but can render textual, image, audio, and video files from network shares. This can be exploited to enumerate both local and network files. This vulnerability (CVE-2020-3798) has been resolved in Adobe's 4.5.11.187303 release [3].
- Calibre 3 and Icecream Ebook Reader use the insecure WebKit 538.1 engine, released in 2014. By leveraging known vulnerabilities, we were able to leak arbitrary file contents in Calibre 3. This issue has been mitigated in Calibre version 4, which uses an updated engine.

**macOS (10.14.6):**
- **Table II** shows the results for macOS.
- All reading systems except FBReader and Amazonâ€™s Kindle application support JavaScript execution.
- Adobe Digital Editions, Apple Books, Azardi, BookReader, and Calibre are among the systems that allow various levels of resource access and remote communication.
- Detailed features and vulnerabilities for each system are listed in the table.

**Linux Ubuntu (18.04):**
- **Table III** shows the results for Linux.
- Calibre, FBReader, and Okular are the evaluated systems.
- Features and vulnerabilities for each system are detailed in the table.

#### Mobile Platforms

**iOS:**
- **Table IV** shows the results for iOS.
- The systems include Aldiko Book Reader, Apple Books, Bluefire Reader, CHMate, and others.
- Features and vulnerabilities for each system are detailed in the table.
