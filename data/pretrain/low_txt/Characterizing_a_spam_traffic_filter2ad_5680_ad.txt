### Analysis of E-Mail Inter-Arrival Times

We found that the inter-arrival times of e-mails are exponentially distributed in all three workloads: non-spam, spam, and aggregate. This is illustrated in Figures 6-a, 6-b, and 6-c, which show typical periods of stable arrival rates for each workload.

To evaluate the sensitivity of the distribution to the period of measurement, we analyzed the inter-arrival times during different periods. Figure 7 presents the cumulative distributions of inter-arrival times for two distinct periods: one during the day and the other during the evening, for each workload. 

- **Non-Spam Workload (Figure 7-a):** During the day, approximately 86% of inter-arrival times are within 5 seconds, indicating a bursty pattern. In the evening, this percentage drops to 40%, suggesting less burstiness.
- **Spam Workload (Figure 7-b):** The distribution remains consistent across both periods, with no significant change.
- **Aggregate Workload (Figure 7-c):** The results are intermediate, showing some variation but not as pronounced as in the non-spam workload.

Table 5 summarizes our findings, showing the ranges of the mean and coefficient of variation of the inter-arrival times (measured in seconds) and the range values of the parameter (e-mail arrival rate) of the best-fitted exponential distribution for all analyzed periods in each workload. 

- **Spam Workload:** The arrival rate remains relatively stable, with the peak arrival rate being only 25% higher than the minimum.
- **Non-Spam Workload:** The arrival rates vary significantly, with differences up to a factor of five across the periods.
- **Aggregate Traffic:** Shows lower variations compared to the non-spam workload.

These findings contrast with previous studies [13, 14], which found that the distribution of e-mail inter-arrival times at four e-mail servers is a combination of Weibull and Pareto distributions. However, the reported coefficient of variation in those studies was close to 1, similar to our results. Our findings also align with other prior work [27] that used a non-stationary Poisson process to model SMTP connection arrivals with reasonable accuracy.

### Analysis of E-Mail Sizes

We found that the distribution of e-mail sizes is most accurately approximated by a Log-normal distribution in all three workloads, both at the body and the tail of the data. This is illustrated in Figures 8 and 9 for a typical day.

- **Figures 8 (a-c):** Show the probability density functions of the data and the fitted Log-normal distributions for the non-spam, spam, and aggregate workloads, respectively.
- **Figures 9 (a-c):** Present semi-log plots of the complementary cumulative distributions for the same data.

Table 6 provides the ranges of the mean, coefficient of variation, and parameter values of the best-fitted Log-normal distribution for each workload, across all days analyzed. These results are consistent with previous e-mail workload characterizations [13, 14].

### Analyzing E-Mail Senders and Recipients

This section further analyzes e-mail senders and recipients in our three workloads. The popularity of e-mail recipients and senders is examined, providing insights into their behavior and characteristics.
