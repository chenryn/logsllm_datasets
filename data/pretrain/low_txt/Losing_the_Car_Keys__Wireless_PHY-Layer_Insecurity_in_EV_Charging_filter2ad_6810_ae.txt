In this section, we describe our eavesdropping tool in detail. As noted in Section 6, the tool is effectively a modified receiver design, although newly implemented entirely in software. Since HomePlug GreenPHY (HPGP) is an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) technology, many elements of the tool structure are similar to a Wi-Fi receiver.

**Figure 12: Diagram of the CCS Communication Circuit**
The loads on each line connected to the PLC modem are not balanced. Resistors R2 & R3 alter the voltage in the low-level communication but also vary the imbalance further.

**Figure 13: HomePlug AV Adaptors Communicating Across a Short Wire**
Conducted signals and radiated emissions can be seen on the oscilloscope (top in yellow and bottom in blue, respectively).

**Signal Capture and Preprocessing**
Raw signals are first collected using a suitable capture device. A Rigol DSA-2302A oscilloscope was used in our testbed arrangement. Even at short distances, radiated emissions were easily observed; the yellow line represents the conducted signal, while the blue line is the radiated signal received by a short random-wire antenna. We later employed software-defined radios for real-time signal capture and streaming.

**Frequency Domain Filtering**
The captured signal is filtered in the frequency domain, benefiting from knowledge of the active regions of the HPGP band. A sharp-edged digital filter removes regions with notable interference or where channel gain is too low to provide useful information. The signal is then resampled into the HPGP native timebase of 75MHz.

**Frame Detection and Time Alignment**
With the signal pre-filtered and digitized, PPDUs are detected using a Double Sliding-Window power detector, which accurately identifies the rise in power that accompanies the start of a packet. The detector calculates the power of the incoming signal and maintains two windows A and B of equal length L, arranged with a time lag. At each sample, the power in each window is updated, and the total power in A is divided by that in B. This configuration causes the output signal to spike quickly on increases in power levels while remaining stable at equal power levels (i.e., prior to or during a frame). By selecting an appropriate value of L, transient noise can be prevented from triggering a frame.

**OFDM Time Synchronization**
OFDM requires precise time synchronization for correct demodulation. This is achieved by correlating the entire preamble against a template, providing sample-accurate alignment.

**CPO, SCO, and Channel Estimation**
In practice, a transmitter and receiver in an OFDM system will have neither precisely-aligned oscillators nor synchronized sample clocks, leading to Carrier Phase Offset (CPO) and Sampling Clock Offset (SCO). CPO causes an apparent frequency offset for the entire received signal, while SCO leads to an apparent phase drift across subcarriers. Both phenomena hamper demodulation and must be corrected. Channel estimation assesses the gain and phase alterations experienced by the signal due to the propagation environment.

**Demodulation**
Demodulation takes place in the frequency domain after the removal of the cyclic prefix for the symbol and correction for the channel effects at each subcarrier. As HPGP uses QPSK modulation, the receiver compares the measured value for the subcarrier in the in-phase and quadrature channels to the nominal values and estimates the likelihood of the transmitted value under an additive white Gaussian noise assumption.

**Post-Processing**
Demodulated soft bits are combined by averaging to benefit from HPGP’s redundancy schemes. They are then rearranged to undo the channel interleaving process. FEC decoding is applied to produce hard decisions about the bit values. Finally, the bits are unscrambled by XORing with the same generator polynomial used in the transmitter to recover the original sequence.

**CRC Checks**
CRC checks are computed over the received bits to determine if the contents have been received successfully. However, the PHY-layer bits are delivered to the higher layers irrespective of errors, as even messages containing errors may provide useful information.

Each stage of the receiver is configurable with a wide range of parameters, allowing tailoring to a given scenario. Considering the emissions as a wireless channel, the simple modulation and redundancy in HomePlug GreenPHY's robust ("ROBO") transmission modes mean the attacker need not match the channel characteristics of any particular receiver; they need only to receive the transmissions with enough of the signal intact.
