### Table 3: Performance Metrics at the "Median [10th Percentile, 90th Percentile]" for Various Relay Selection Strategies Under Medium Congestion

| Strategy | Throughput (KBps) | P-RTT (milliseconds) | Time-to-First-Byte (seconds) | Improvement (%) |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|------------------|
| Default Tor | 773 [418, 3840] | 648 [395, 1884] | 954 [439, 6410] | - |
| Strategy A | 901 [447, 4009] | 12.4% | 9.7% | -55.7% |
| Strategy B | -235.8% | 17.4% | -88.7% | -82.3% |
| Strategy C | 32.1% | - | - | - |

**Note:** The table shows performance metrics at the "median [10th percentile, 90th percentile]" for various relay selection strategies applied under medium congestion. The percentage improvement relative to default Tor at the median is shown in bold. Improvement means higher numbers for throughput and lower numbers for time-to-first-byte and P-RTT.

### Relationship Between Latency and Bandwidth in TCP
There is an indirect relationship between latency and bandwidth when using TCP (as Tor does). Thus, the Coordinates strategy incorporates a (admittedly loose) proxy for bandwidth in its selection process.

### Evaluation of LASTor
Our results indicate that the recently proposed LASTor relay selection strategy is unlikely to be effective on the live Tor network. The evaluation method used by Akhoondi et al., which involved making HTTP HEAD requests over LASTor paths, did not realistically exercise the performance of those paths. A HEAD request is generally less than 1 KB, while typical web pages are two orders of magnitude larger. Since LASTor does not consider the bandwidth of relays, its performance degrades significantly under realistic traffic loads. Our clean room implementation of LASTor did not include the AS awareness portion of the algorithm, but even if it had, it is unlikely that this would have improved performance, as Akhoondi et al. showed that AS awareness increased the latency of instantiated paths.

### Refinements to LASTor
Akhoondi et al. suggested refinements to their basic LASTor strategy, omitting relays with bandwidth less than 100 KBps. We evaluated this refinement and found that while it provides a significant improvement in performance, LASTor still lags behind other strategies. Details of this evaluation are provided in the Appendix.

### Incremental Advantages of Coordinate-Based Systems
Our results suggest that adding a coordinate-based system to Tor may provide some incremental advantage to relay selection. Tor+Coordinates achieved a slight performance improvement over Tor under most conditions and rarely performed worse. Similarly, the performance of the Congestion-aware strategy suggests that similar techniques offer a window of opportunity for incrementally improving Tor. While bandwidth remains the most significant indicator of performance, a layered approach that optimizes latency and congestion as well as throughput might be beneficial. Since these techniques are largely orthogonal, future work could explore the benefits of further combination. Additional areas of future work include developing defenses to protect coordinate systems from manipulation.

### Conclusion
We have demonstrated the feasibility of building a topology from Internet routing information that reasonably represents the live Tor network and is reducible to a size viable for emulation and other environments. Our models of the Tor network enable whole-network comparative evaluation of a set of relay selection methods. Our results indicate that recently proposed algorithms that do not consider bandwidth during relay selection result in poor performance. The Congestion-aware strategy shows significant promise, especially in congested networks, and has little anonymity impact. Our Tor+Coordinates selection method also offers a modest improvement in both bandwidth and latency over Tor’s default strategy. Additionally, we show the importance of full network evaluation when considering new relay selection strategies, as performance can differ significantly from the experience of a single client.

### Future Work
As emulation frameworks such as Shadow and ExperimenTor mature and begin to support larger topologies, the limitations of the 50-relay model can be ameliorated by using larger models (such as our 1524-relay model) for performance evaluation.

### A. LASTor Proposed Bandwidth Enhancement
We evaluated a variant of the bandwidth enhancement proposed by Akhoondi et al. [2]. They refine their basic LASTor strategy by restricting the relays chosen within each gridsquare to only those relays that have a reported bandwidth greater than 100 KBps. We implemented this refinement with one modification due to the potentially small number of relays per gridsquare in our emulation environment: we limit the set of paths to those in which a relay meeting the 100 KBps bandwidth restriction is guaranteed at each step.

Figure 13 shows the throughput and P-RTT of the modified version of LASTor, under medium congestion with homogeneous clients. The proposed refinement significantly increases the performance of LASTor (relative to the version without the bandwidth constraint), but still results in much worse performance than Tor and Tor+Coordinates.

**Figure 13.** The throughput (top) and P-RTT (bottom) of LASTor with the proposed refinement shown alongside Tor+Coordinates, Tor, and the standard LASTor.
