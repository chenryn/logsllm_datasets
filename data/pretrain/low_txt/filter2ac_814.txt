**ATT&CK ID:** T1407  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Download New Code at Runtime

Adversaries may download and execute dynamic code that was not included in the original application package after installation. This technique is primarily used to evade static analysis checks and pre-publication scans conducted by official app stores. While more advanced dynamic or behavioral analysis methods might detect this behavior, the use of Execution Guardrails can make it significantly more challenging to identify and prevent the execution of malicious code downloaded post-installation.
