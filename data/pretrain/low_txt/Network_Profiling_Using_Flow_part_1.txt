## 1. Introduction

A network profile is an inventory of all assets on a network and their associated purposes. Such a profile enables network administrators to better understand how configuration changes will affect the network. Security administrators can use the profile to identify policy violations and suspicious activity. Business administrators can use it to guide long-term plans for network upgrades and staffing. As the profile evolves, network operators and defenders can monitor for emerging concerns, leading to policy changes and resource reallocation.

This report outlines the steps for creating a profile of externally facing assets on mid-sized to large networks serving thousands to hundreds of thousands of users. The process involves analyzing traffic over ports, protocols, and other network flow (netflow) data available at perimeter gateways. While some steps may be useful for profiling intranet traffic, additional issues related to intranets are not addressed here. By the end of this tutorial, you should have a list of assets, the ports on which each communicates, and notes on any associated questionable activity.

The general steps for network profiling are:
1. Gather available network information
2. Select an initial data set
3. Identify the active address space
4. Catalog common services
5. Catalog other services
6. Catalog leftover assets
7. Report on findings

These steps can be turned into a cyclic feedback loop to maintain the profile, as shown in Figure 1.

### 1.1 Sample Data

We demonstrate the creation of a network profile using sample data collected from the perimeter of an enterprise network. The data were anonymized after analysis to protect the confidentiality of the network owner without impairing the data’s usefulness.

### 1.2 The SiLK Analysis Tool Suite

The case study in this report uses SiLK for analysis. SiLK records uniflow traffic, meaning inbound and outbound traffic are recorded separately. SiLK differentiates between inbound and outbound traffic based on the source and destination IP addresses but does not identify traffic as client or server, unlike some other flow platforms.

SiLK is configured by setting an address range for the internal network. The type of flow is then determined based on whether the source and destination IP addresses are inside or outside that range. As shown in Figure 2, a flow of type “in” is defined as traffic with an external source address and an internal destination address. A flow of type “out” is defined as traffic with an internal source address and an external destination address.

Web traffic is separated from other traffic and is defined in SiLK by default as traffic to or from ports 80, 443, or 8080, labeled as “inweb” or “outweb” based on the same reasoning as flows of type “in” or “out.”

### 1.3 Keeping Track of Findings

A spreadsheet like Table 1 is extremely useful for recording findings throughout the profiling process. The headers you choose will depend on the information needed about the network and may be adapted for each step of the process.

| Internal IP | Protocol | Internal Port | Internal Name | External IP | External Port | External Name | Comments |
|-------------|----------|---------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|----------|

Throughout the process, record the commands and tools used to gather and validate the data. This record will enable automation of certain parts of the process, making future updates less labor-intensive and allowing for reproducible results. Shell scripts have been included in Appendix B for reference, though they may or may not be appropriate for a specific network.

### 1.4 Extending the Analysis

The steps in this report are not the only way to use network flow data to learn about a network. As you become more comfortable with the analysis tool, you can delve into further detail if the traffic flows look interesting or out of place. Flow data can be used for forensics, finding malicious activity, and determining appropriate packet prioritization settings, among other things.

## 2. Gather Available Network Information

Gathering any available information about the network before beginning the profile is crucial because it sets the scope for the rest of the process. Types of information that could be collected include address space, network maps, lists of servers and proxies, and policies governing network design. This information may be incomplete, but it provides a starting point for the profiling process.
