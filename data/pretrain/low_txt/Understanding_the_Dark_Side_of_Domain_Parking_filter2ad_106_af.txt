### Compliance with Policies and Visitor Protection
The websites and advertisements we established were fully compliant with the policies of ad networks and traffic systems. We ensured that no harm was inflicted upon visitors, and we did not collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from them.

### 7. Related Work

#### Parking Services
Although domain parking services have been in existence for many years, there has been limited research into their security implications. The closest related work includes studies on typo-squatting [37, 22, 9], which show that domain owners use this technique for profit. Additionally, previous research indicates that malicious domains are often parked once detected [27, 17]. A study on click spam [10] focuses on detection and mentions the potential involvement of one parking service (Sedo) based on its JavaScript. However, such code was not found in our research. Our work stands out as a systematic study of the illicit activities within parking services, which has not been previously conducted. This was made possible through a new infiltration analysis we performed. Our findings not only confirm the presence of illicit operations but also highlight their scope and magnitude.

#### Illicit Activities in Online Advertising
Illicit activities in online advertising have been extensively studied, including click-fraud [21, 4, 5, 11, 25], drive-by-downloads [18], trending-term exploitation [23], and impression fraud [32]. These studies typically focus on conventional adversaries who engage in malicious activities whenever possible. In contrast, parking services operate legitimate businesses with advertisers and ad networks. However, our study reveals that a significant portion of their revenue comes from illicit activities, raising awareness about this unregulated business.

#### Infiltration into Malicious Infrastructure
To understand how underground businesses operate, many studies attempt to infiltrate their infrastructure. Examples include research on spam [16, 15], CAPTCHA solving [24], blackhat SEO [36], and pay-per-install networks [8]. Unlike these studies, our approach required infiltrating the parking monetization process without disrupting its operations. We achieved this by controlling nodes at both ends of the monetization ecosystem and linking them together.

### 8. Conclusion
This paper presents the first systematic study on illicit activities in parked domain monetization. To demystify the "dark side" of parking services, we developed an infiltration analysis to gain control of key nodes in the parking ecosystem and connect them. This allowed us to observe the entire monetization process, confirming the presence of click fraud, traffic spam, and traffic stealing. By expanding our initial seed chains to millions of monetization chains over 5.5 months, we revealed the pervasiveness of these illicit practices and their revenues, calling for policy efforts to control such operations.

### Appendix: The True Operation of Shady Search Sites
Fastonlinefinder.com is one of many search sites we refer to as "shady." These sites rarely display organic results and emphasize sponsored ads. They have been reported in previous works on click fraud [18, 4] and are presumed to be malicious. Many victims have complained about "redirect" malware hijacking their traffic and redirecting to these search sites, as shown in Figure 5.

Through our empirical investigations, we discovered the actual role these sites play. They act as click servers for search ads, similar to traditional click servers for non-search advertisements, and are owned and operated by ad networks. Another use of these sites is to set the click referral, leading advertisers to assume their ads were displayed on the referring search site.

It is important to note that the use of such search sites is not illegal; it is only misunderstood due to their abuse by ad network publishers. A fraudulent publisher may use malware or Trojans to generate clicks on their ads, and since the clicks lead to an ad network's search sites, the search site becomes wrongly accused as the malicious party.

### Evidence Survey
During our infiltration, we collected evidence to support our findings. Figure 6 confirms traffic stealing by one parking service that does not report traffic, as shown in 6(a), which was monetized through 7search and verified by our payment for the traffic, as shown in 6(b).

Additionally, we verified the association of search sites to ad networks by registering with two ad networks (Advertise & Bidvertiser) as a publisher interested in displaying their sponsored ads. We set up our website, toppagefinder.com, to pull sponsored ads from the ad networks, as shown in Figure 7.

Finally, in Figure 8, we show examples of visits to domains parked with PS5 leading to malware downloads through two traffic systems, DNTX and ZeroRedirect.
