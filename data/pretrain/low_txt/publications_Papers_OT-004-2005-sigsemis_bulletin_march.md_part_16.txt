### AIS SIGSEMIS Bulletin 2(1) January-March 2005

#### 4th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC 2005)
- **Dates**: November 6 - 10, 2005
- **Location**: Galway, Ireland
- **Supported by**: Semantic Web Science Association in cooperation with the Knowledge Web and DARPA

The ISWC is a premier international forum for presenting visionary and state-of-the-art research on all aspects of the Semantic Web. The ISWC 2005 follows the success of previous conferences:
- ISWC 2002: Sardinia, Italy (June 9-12, 2002)
- ISWC 2003: Florida, USA (October 20-23, 2003)
- ISWC 2004: Hiroshima, Japan (November 7-11, 2004)

**Call for Research Papers**

**Fourth International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC 2005)**
- **Dates**: November 6 – 10, 2005
- **Venue**: Radisson SAS Hotel, Galway, Ireland
- **Website**: http://iswc2005.semanticweb.org

Building on the current architecture of the World Wide Web, Semantic Web technologies provide a wide range of tools and techniques to support automated reasoning over distributed representations of web content. These technologies will enable a new generation of applications for education, business, science, and consumer services, and will inspire novel tools for general collaboration and research.

The Semantic Web presents an unprecedented challenge of scale and heterogeneity to existing work in expressive representation and query languages, reasoning engines, data representation and integration, interoperability middleware, and distributed computing. To foster the exchange of ideas and collaboration, the International Semantic Web Conference brings together researchers from relevant disciplines such as artificial intelligence, databases, distributed computing, and information systems.

**Topics of Interest**
- Applications of Semantic Web technologies with clear lessons learned
- Semantic Web for e-business, e-science, e-government, and e-learning
- User-centered applications of the Semantic Web
- Languages, tools, and methodologies for representing and managing Semantic Web data
- Robust and scalable knowledge management and reasoning on the Web
- Ontology creation, extraction, and evolution
- Ontology mapping, merging, and alignment
- Database technologies for the Semantic Web
- Semantic Web middleware
- Machine learning and human language technologies for the Semantic Web
- Semantic Web services
- Agents on the Web

### Call for Papers: PRODIS 2005 Workshop
**Workshop Background and Objectives**
Despite the high expectations, e-business models and applications have not been as successful as anticipated, with e-marketplaces and e-procurement being prominent examples. A major obstacle is the insufficient degree of reliable mechanization in the exchange and integration of product-related content between business partners. Product-related data is crucial for various processes along the product life cycle, from design and construction to sales, procurement, and disposal. Traditionally, this data resides in intra-organizational systems like ERP, PDM, and PLM, and its exchange is often manual and costly, leading to inconsistent data and delayed decision-making.

While there has been significant research on ontological aspects and industry standards, a comprehensive and consensual understanding of the problem domain and its multiple facets is still lacking. This workshop aims to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss innovative approaches, models, concepts, and solutions that address the key role of product-related data in information systems.

**Possible Topics**
- Product-related content integration in e-business
- Product data quality and interoperability
- Modeling, design, maintenance, and versioning of product-related data
- Product ontologies and ontological aspects of product-related data
- Standards for product classification and description
- Product data and product life-cycle management
- Product dictionaries and properties
- Cases and tools for managing product-related data
- Product data and related e-business standards
- Product data and ERP systems
- Dissemination and acceptance of product-related standards
- Product data in electronic catalogs
- Multilingual catalogs
- Concepts and mechanisms for distributed product catalogs
- Product models for configuration, pricing, and services
- Usage of product data for spend analysis

**Important Dates**
- **April 29, 2005**: Submission of papers
- **May 27, 2005**: Notification of acceptance
- **June 24, 2005**: Camera-ready versions due
- **September [TBD], 2005**: Workshop

**Submission Guidelines**
- **Language**: English
- **Format**: LNI (Lecture Notes in Informatics) format (www.gi-ev.de/LNI/autorenrichtlinien/guidelines.pdf)
