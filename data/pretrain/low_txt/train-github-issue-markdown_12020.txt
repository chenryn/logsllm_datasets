### Issue Description

When running `celery inspect ping` without any Celery workers, the exit code differs between Celery versions 4.3.1 and 5.0.5.

#### Steps to Reproduce

1. **Without running any Celery worker:**

   ```sh
   celery --version
   > 4.3.1 (rhubarb)
   celery inspect ping
   > Error: No nodes replied within time constraint.
   echo $?
   > 69
   ```

2. **After upgrading to Celery 5.0.5:**

   ```sh
   pip install celery==5.0.5
   celery --version
   > 5.0.5 (singularity)
   celery inspect ping
   > No nodes replied within time constraint
   echo $?
   > 0
   ```
