In the C++ backend, undefined Tensors are used to efficiently represent Tensors filled with `0`s. While this approach is supported in many functions, there are several that almost never encounter undefined gradients and, as a result, are not properly implemented:

- All backward functions with direct formulas defined in `derivatives.yaml`
- Most functions in `Functions.cpp`

It is important to note that the assumption that a function with a single output cannot receive undefined gradients is incorrect. Examples of such issues can be found in tickets #33037 and #32619.
