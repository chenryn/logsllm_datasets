**Abstract:**
DrawNet++ is a versatile framework designed to facilitate the compositional construction of dependability models. The primary objectives of this project are to provide:
1. A graphical user interface (GUI) for any graph-based formalism.
2. Support for the design process of dependability models, incorporating object-oriented (OO) concepts.
3. A user-friendly front-end for various analysis and simulation tools.

These features enable rapid prototyping and the reuse of sub-models. The framework supports multiple formalisms, allowing the study of both compositional problems and interoperability issues in a multi-formalism environment. Currently, Parametric Fault Trees (PFT) and Stochastic Well-Formed Nets (SWN) are supported. An XML description of user-defined models is generated, and XSL stylesheets are used to translate the XML representation into a syntax suitable for specific analysis tools.

**1. Overview and Context of DrawNet++**

The DrawNet++ project aims to address the compositional construction of dependability models. Its main goals include:
- Providing a GUI for any graph-based formalism.
- Supporting the design process of dependability models using OO concepts.
- Offering a user-friendly front-end for different classes of analysis and simulation tools.

These features enhance rapid prototyping and the reuse of sub-models. The framework allows for the use of different formalisms, enabling the study of both compositional problems and interoperability issues within a multi-formalism environment. A prototype post-processor has been developed to interface with several analysis and simulation tools, retrieving and displaying performance results. Currently, the framework supports Parametric Fault Trees (PFT) and Stochastic Well-Formed Nets (SWN).

An XML description of the user-defined models is generated by the tool, and XSL stylesheets are used to translate the XML representation into a syntax suitable for the specific analysis tool. DrawNet++ is used to build compositional SWN models and models of highly redundant systems by combining PFT and SWN. State space analysis tools are employed to represent dependencies between components, repair, transient faults, etc., which are modeled using SWN submodels. These predefined blocks are then composed with a SWN model of the system, obtained by automatically translating a PFT model.

In this context, DrawNet++ is used to:
- Define and draw composed models (e.g., PFT and SWN blocks).
- Generate the syntax representation of the entire model.
- Present the results computed by the solvers.

**2. Demonstration of DrawNet++**

The goal of this demonstration is to present:
1. The definition of a graph-based formalism, including compositionality issues.
2. Guidelines for a dependability model construction cycle from PFTs to SWNs.
3. The OO capabilities that can be leveraged in the model design process.

**2.1 Definition of a Graph-Based Formalism**

The first point addresses the XML specification of a graph-based formalism and the automatic creation of a GUI to edit and manipulate (sub)models (Figure 1). This feature enables users to define and modify their models in a visual and intuitive manner.

**2.2 Conversion from PFT to SWN**

The second point deals with the usage of XSL style sheets and the post-processing of models to convert a PFT model into a SWN model. This will be demonstrated through a case study [1].

**2.3 Object-Oriented Capabilities**

The third point aims to showcase the mechanisms for defining classes and objects that represent sets of system component models. It also covers creating hierarchies, implementing information hiding, and specifying template objects. These features allow for more structured and modular model design.
