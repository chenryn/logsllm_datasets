## What is Threat Hunting?

### Definitions and Misconceptions
- **IP, Domain, or Hash Search**
- **Hunting on the Darknet or Internet**
- **Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) = Threat Hunting?**
- **Automated Threat Hunting?**

### Origins and Evolution
- First discussed in the mid-2000s by the NSA and US Air Force.
- Defined in the US Army LandCyber White Paper (2013):
  - "Cyber hunt teams will work inside the Army enterprise to actively search for and locate threats that have penetrated the Army enterprise, but not yet manifested their intended effects."
  - "Counter-reconnaissance, or hunt forces, will work within Army networks to maneuver, secure, and defend key cyberspace terrain, identifying and defeating concealed cyber adversaries that have bypassed the primary avenues of approach monitored by automated systems."

### Key Aspects of Threat Hunting
- **Active Search** within the enterprise
- **Detection of Penetrated Threats**
- **Bypassing Automated Detection Systems**

## People, Process, Technology

### People
- **Assume Breach Mindset**
- **Go Beyond Technology**: Offensive and Defensive Knowledge (Incident Response, Penetration Testing, SOC, Sys Admin, etc.)
- **Not Reserved for Level 3 or the 'Best'**: Research and Innovation Time
- **Threat Hunting 101 – Become The Hunter**

#### Stakeholders
- Senior Management (CIO/CISO)
- Data Protection Office, Governance, Legal
- Other Security Teams (SOC, Incident Response)

### Process
- **Existing Processes**: SIM, Data Privacy, Data Logging, Incident Response
- **Obtaining New Log Sources**
- **Use Case Generation**
- **Hunt Investigation**
- **Measuring Success**

#### Hunt Investigation
- **Investigation Rights for Threat Hunters**
- **Escalation to IR for Further Investigation**
- **IR Starting Investigation Without Confirmed Incidents**
- **Avoid Overloading IR**

#### Measuring Success
- **Do Not Measure by Number of Threats Found**
- **Factors to Consider**:
  - Mean Time to Detect
  - Finding Suspicious Activities and Confirming Malicious Intent
  - Severity of Findings
  - Repeated Findings and False Positives

### Technology
- **Least Important Initially**: Understand Available Data (Endpoint, Network, Application)
- **Configuration Management and Continuous Delivery**: Chef, Puppet
- **Use Case Development and Automation**
- **Technology Stack**:
  - **Endpoint**: GRR, Sysmon, Windows Event Logs, osquery, Mozilla InvestiGator
  - **Network**: BRO, Suricata
  - **Data Store**: ELK, Splunk

---

## How We Are Doing It
- **Network IDS**
- **Network Traffic Analysis**
- **Event Log Correlation**
- **Alerting**
- **Memory Analysis**
- **Persistence**
- **Process Monitoring**
- **Offline Monitoring**
- **File Analysis**
- **Forensic Artifacts**
- **Dynamic Tool Update**

### The PARIS Model
- **People, Technology, Process**
- **Automated Notification**
- **Hunting Use Case Generation (Hypothesis)**
- **Confidence Levels**: 10%, 40%, 80%, 99%
- **Tactical Threat Intelligence**
- **Capability**
- **Use Case Execution**
- **Automation**

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Enterprise Ransomware
- **Background**: Global Company with USD$ 133 million turnover
- **Attack Stages**: Delivery, Exploitation, C2, Privilege Escalation, Lateral Movement, Objective
- **Response Actions**:
  - Fast Deployment of Agents
  - Monitoring: Process Memory, Registry, Process Execution, Autoruns, Scheduled Tasks
  - Additional Measures Needed

### Case Study 2: Insider Threat
- **Background**: Global Company with USD$ 799 million turnover, 70,000 endpoints
- **Suspicious Files**:
  - `“%userprofile%\appdata\roaming\Microsoft\windows\start menu\programs\startup\i tunes.exe`
  - `“%programdata%\Microsoft\windows\start menu\programs\startup\bstack.exe”`
- **Reasons for Suspicion**:
  - Unusual File Locations
  - Low Host Count
  - Not Seen by VirusTotal

### Case Study 3: Fileless Malware
- **Definition**: Resides in RAM, Injects into Running or Suspended Processes
- **Invisibility Techniques**:
  - IAT/EAT Hooking
  - Inline Hooking
  - Reflective Load
  - APC Injection
  - Process Hollowing

### Case Study 4: Hunt of the Day (HOTD)
- **Importance**: Latest Findings, Immediate Action
- **Example**: `regsvr32.exe /s /n /u /i:”C:\xxxxxxxxx” scrobj.dll`

## Getting Started

### Steps to Begin
- **Start Small, Dream Big**
- **Work with Existing Resources**:
  - People (Hunt Sprint)
  - Process
  - Technology
- **Target Low-Hanging Fruit First**
- **Budget Justification**: DBIR/Equifax
- **MITRE ATT&CK™ Framework**

### Conclusion
- **Threat Hunting as Part of Detection Strategy**
- **Anyone Can Start Threat Hunting**
- **Establish People, Process, Then Technology**
