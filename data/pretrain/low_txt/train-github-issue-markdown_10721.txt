### Issue Description

When using a Next.js application in production mode with assets hosted on a static (non-Next.js-powered) CDN, the application fails to load correctly when a user navigates to a non-existent page.

### Expected Behavior

The expected behavior is for the application to perform a full page refresh. This would allow seamless integration between Next.js-powered pages and other web pages on the internet.

### Current Behavior

Instead of performing a full page refresh, the application renders an unexpected error page:

### Context

This issue prevents us from integrating new Next.js-powered pages with our existing website, as it causes navigation to non-existent pages to fail.

### Environment

- **Next.js Version:** 5.0.0
- **Node.js Version:** 8.9.3
- **Operating System:** macOS 10.13.3
- **Browser:** Chrome 64
