### Categories of Rules for Packaging Applications

According to Von Halle (2001), several categories of rules can be identified for packaging applications, including fact rules, computation rules, inferred knowledge rules, action-enabling rules, and constraint rules. Below are examples of each category as they apply to dynamic package applications.

#### Fact Rules
A simple fact rule is: "Renting an AVIS car, class B, costs thirty euros per day." This type of rule has been previously illustrated in RuleML.

#### Computation Rules
Computation rules are used to calculate the price of a dynamic package for a customer by subtracting any discounts (e.g., hotel, car, and flight discounts) from the base fee:
\[ \text{PackagePrice} = \text{BasePrice} - \text{HotelDiscount} - \text{CarDiscount} - \text{FlightDiscount} \]

#### Inferred Knowledge Rules
Inferred knowledge rules determine additional benefits or discounts based on certain conditions. For example:
- If the package price exceeds 5,000 euros, the customer receives a 15% discount on the amount exceeding 3,000 euros.
  \[ \text{If PackagePrice} > 5000 \]
  \[ \text{THEN Discount} = 0.15 \times (\text{PackagePrice} - 3000) \]
  \[ \text{ELSE Discount} = 0 \]

#### Action-Enabling Rules
Action-enabling rules, also known as triggers, prompt the dynamic packaging application to take predefined actions upon the occurrence of specific events. For instance:
- If a credit card payment is rejected, the system should notify the customer.
  \[ \text{IF rejection of credit card payment} \]
  \[ \text{THEN notify customer} \]

#### Constraint Rules
Constraint rules ensure that the final price of a dynamic package does not exceed the sum of its individual components:
\[ (\text{PackagePrice} - \text{Discount}) \leq \sum(\text{Individual travel products}) \]

### Dynamic Packaging Engine

The dynamic packaging engine reads the rules specifications and generates valid packages that comply with the defined rules. It uses linear programming (LP) to make constrained decisions, optimizing a linear objective function associated with package requirements. For example, the LP module could determine how many days a traveler can spend in a five-star hotel in Lisbon, Portugal, near the ocean, with a rented car, for 1,500 euros.

Once the packaging rules are represented using linear equations, either as objectives or constraints, LP can solve large problems to generate optimal dynamic packages. This ensures that the best possible dynamic package is constructed, given the objective function. The speed and quality of the configurations produced by the LP module allow planners to explore different scenarios with varying prices, durations, and levels of comfort.

### Future Trends

Travel agents face challenges due to reduced commission revenues. For example, in 1997, major U.S. airlines reduced the commission rate payable to traditional and online travel agencies from 10% to 8%, and from 8% to 5%, respectively. Additionally, many airlines have implemented zero commissions since 1998 (Joystar, 2005). Vacation providers are expected to follow suit, leading to further reductions in commissions (Forrester, 2005).

To increase profit margins, travel agents must adopt new tools to dynamically package their clients' holiday requirements. This added value allows travel agents to earn margins through a combination of reduced commissions and booking fees. Therefore, dynamic packaging is crucial for the travel industry, enabling airlines, hotels, tour operators, and travel agencies to create custom packages for consumers.

### The Semantic Web and Dynamic Packaging

The Semantic Web promises to provide advanced applications for Internet users through the use of metadata (e.g., RDF and OWL) attached to various information resources. These technologies will form the foundation of "killer apps" that overcome the limitations of current web technology in finding, integrating, understanding, interpreting, and processing information.

Dynamic packaging applications, with their requirements for interoperability, integration, knowledge inference, and rule management, are well-suited for development using Semantic Web technologies. This approach can enhance the flexibility and efficiency of dynamic packaging, making it more responsive to market demands.

### Conclusion

The demand for customized tourism itineraries is growing, and (online) agencies seek technology that provides flexibility to create unique dynamic packages without the complexity of contract rules and pricing issues. Despite some implementation by major online travel agencies (e.g., Expedia, Travelocity, and Orbitz), current dynamic packaging applications need to be enhanced with emerging technologies to improve interoperability and integration.

Previous studies have shown that the strategic potential of dynamic packaging technologies is limited by interoperability and integration issues. This chapter describes a systematic approach using the latest developments in the Semantic Web, such as semantics and ontologies, to address these challenges. We conclude that the Semantic Web can significantly improve dynamic packaging applications in the travel industry.

Another limitation of current dynamic packaging applications is the difficulty in managing the rules that govern the dynamic creation of travel packages. Traditional approaches hard-code rules into the applications, making them difficult to change, manage, share, or reuse. Using packaging rules defined in a business rule language and semantic standards like RuleML, non-programmers can add and modify rules, allowing for better sharing and execution across the travel industry.
