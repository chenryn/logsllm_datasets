### Global Integration and Networking

Global integration, both intra- and inter-enterprise, enhances the fusion of the real world and the virtual web-based world. This is achieved through a generic and open architecture that increases interoperability among heterogeneous types of networked computational resources. Each component resource is autonomous, proactive, cooperative, and aware of its own and others' descriptions of basic functionality, goals, behaviors, and roles in different scenarios.

### Extending Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

Extending the SOA concept involves exposing Web services as resources managed by proactive agents. These agents can coordinate, participate as components in multiple business processes, and negotiate their roles and settings in appropriate scenarios. This extension:

- Enables wider exploitation of RFID and smart tags.
- Facilitates more automated processes and new classes of applications and business scenarios, where real-world objects and hardware devices act as consumers of software and remote human services.

### Extending Semantic Technology

Extending semantic technology provides tools for the semantic management of content relevant to or produced by dynamic, heterogeneous, proactive, and cooperative resources. This extension offers a universal and innovative solution for building dynamic integrated business solutions.

### Extending Agent Technology

Extending agent technology includes adding semantics and ontologies to agent platforms, creating semantic agents. This enhancement:

- Enhances cross-layer networking (intra-enterprise networking and interoperability) by seamlessly integrating heterogeneous resources from different layers of the enterprise.
- Facilitates B2B networking (inter-enterprise networking and interoperability) by seamlessly integrating resources from similar layers of different companies.
- Supports global networking (integration of intra- and inter-enterprise networking and interoperability) by seamlessly integrating heterogeneous resources from different layers of different companies.

### Business Impacts of PRIME

PRIME's business impacts include:

- **Cross-Layer Networking**: Seamless integration of heterogeneous resources from different layers of the enterprise.
- **B2B Networking**: Seamless integration of resources from similar layers of different companies.
- **Global Networking**: Seamless integration of heterogeneous resources from different layers of different companies.
- **Global Scenarios Running**: Global business processes and globally distributed enterprise operations, such as Finnish experts diagnosing German manufacturing machines using SMEs' Web services for assistance.
- **Autonomic and Proactive Nature**: Adds flexibility and self-manageability to PRIME, simplifying the design of complex business models or B2B scenarios.
- **Increasing Experts’ Productivity**: Through extended wiki functionality, adding content from registered hardware and software, and utilizing human-driven content as annotations.
- **Massive Reuse of Resources**: Opportunities for small and medium companies to sell their resources, innovations, experiences, and expertise as components in PRIME-supported business processes.
- **Facilitating New Services and Applications**: Seizing market opportunities and leading to more efficient, flexible, and productive large infrastructures and manufacturing plants.
- **Control of Complex Systems**: Enabling a wider range of RFID applications.
- **Extended Range of RFID Applications**: Current RFID technology focuses on inventory and asset management tagging. PRIME will enable a wide range of new RFID-based applications in various industries, including identification/access, security, inventory management, environmental conditions, physical security, and maintenance.

### Summary of PRIME

PRIME is based on a solid theory that integrates ubiquitous computing, distributed artificial intelligence, semantic technology, and Web 2.0. It aims to provide enterprise interoperability, effective knowledge sharing and reuse, high levels of flexibility and efficiency, real-time re-configurability, rapid deployment, and delivery of new ubiquitous information society services.

### Prototype and Conclusion

The first prototype developed by the Industrial Ontologies Group according to the PRIME approach is called UBIWARE ("Smart Semantic Middleware for Ubiquitous Computing"). UBIWARE has been developed as a new software technology and tool to support design and installation, autonomic operation, and interoperability among complex, heterogeneous, open, dynamic, and self-configurable distributed industrial systems. It provides services such as coordination, collaboration, interoperability, data, and process integration.

In this paper, we have presented our vision, requirements, and architecture for the essential qualitative extension of UBIWARE functionality, which is based on the introduction and implementation of the "Middleware-as-a-Service" technological concept.
