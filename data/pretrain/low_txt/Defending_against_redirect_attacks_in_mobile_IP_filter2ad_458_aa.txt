## Abstract
The route optimization feature in Mobile IP Version 6 (MIPv6) allows direct communication between any correspondent node and a mobile node, thereby eliminating the "triangle routing" problem present in the base Mobile IP Version 4 (MIPv4) protocol. However, this feature requires mobile nodes to continuously inform their correspondent nodes of their new care-of addresses through binding update messages. Unauthenticated or malicious binding updates can enable intruders to perform redirect attacks, which redirect traffic from correspondent nodes to locations chosen by the intruders. Securing binding update messages to prevent such attacks is a significant challenge in the open environment of MIPv6. In this paper, we first examine two solutions proposed by the IETF Mobile IP Working Group and highlight their weaknesses. We then introduce a new protocol for securing binding update messages, demonstrating that it achieves strong security while remaining highly scalable for widespread deployment.

## 1. Introduction
Mobile networking technologies, along with the proliferation of portable and wireless devices, are transforming how people perceive the Internet. In mobile networking, communications are not disrupted when a user changes their device's point of attachment to the Internet; all network reconnections occur automatically and transparently.

In today's Internet, the Internet Protocol (IP) routes packets from source to destination based on the subnet prefix derived from the destination IP address. As a mobile node roams, it needs to change its IP address each time it moves to a new location. However, to maintain existing transport-layer connections, the mobile node must keep its IP address the same, as changing the IP address would disrupt and lose these connections.

This dilemma is addressed in Mobile IP (MIP) by allowing a mobile node to be identified by two IP addresses: a home address and a care-of address. The home address is assigned within the subnet prefix on the mobile node's home link, while the care-of address is a temporary address acquired when visiting a foreign link. This dual-address mechanism allows packets to be routed to the mobile node regardless of its current point of attachment, making the movement of the mobile node transparent to transport and higher-layer protocols. MIPv4 was specified in [1], and the most recent specification for MIPv6 was published by the IETF Mobile IP Working Group in [2]. Mobility support in IPv6 is particularly important, as mobile devices are expected to make up a significant fraction of the Internet's population during the lifetime of IPv6.

MIPv6 shares many features with MIPv4 but includes several major differences, one of which is the built-in support for "Route Optimization." This functionality allows direct routing from any correspondent node to any mobile node without passing through the mobile node's home link, thus eliminating the "triangle routing" problem in MIPv4.

Route optimization in MIPv6 requires the mobile node, its home agent, and the correspondent node to maintain a Binding Cache. A binding associates a mobile node's home address with a care-of address, along with the remaining lifetime of that association. Unauthenticated binding update messages provide intruders an easy means to launch "Redirect Attacks," which redirect traffic from correspondent nodes to destinations chosen by the intruders. Therefore, securing binding update messages is crucial for MIPv6 to meet its basic security requirements. An earlier IETF draft on MIPv6 was returned by the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) to the Mobile IP Working Group due to concerns about the security and scalability of binding update messages [3].

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide an overview of MIPv6 operations, focusing on route optimization and binding update operations. We also detail the types of redirect attacks and state the security assumptions in MIPv6. In Section 3, we review two solutions proposed by the IETF Mobile IP Working Group for protecting binding update messages against redirect attacks and highlight their security limitations. Section 4 introduces our new protocol and its analysis. Finally, Section 5 contains our concluding remarks.

## 2. Operation, Redirect Attacks, and Security Assumptions in Mobile IPv6

### 2.1 Mobile IPv6 Basic Operation
In MIPv6 [2], every mobile node has a home address, an IP address assigned within its home link. A mobile node is always addressable by its home address, whether it is attached to its home link or away from home. When at home, packets addressed to its home address are routed using standard IPv6 mechanisms. Since the subnet prefix of the home address is the same as the home link's subnet prefix, packets addressed to it will be routed to the home link.

When a mobile node is away from home and attached to a foreign link (see Figure 1), it is also addressable by one or more care-of addresses, in addition to its home address. A care-of address is an IP address associated with the mobile node while visiting a particular foreign link. The subnet prefix of the care-of address is the subnet prefix on the foreign link. The mobile node typically acquires its care-of address through stateless [4] or stateful (e.g., DHCPv6, [5]) address autoconfiguration. While on the foreign link, the mobile node registers its care-of address with its home agent by sending a Binding Update message. The home agent then uses proxy Neighbor Discovery to intercept any IPv6 packets addressed to the mobile node's home address on the home link and tunnels each intercepted packet to the mobile node's care-of address. To tunnel intercepted packets, the home agent encapsulates the packets using IPv6 encapsulation, with the outer IPv6 header addressed to the mobile node's care-of address.

A mobile node can initiate route optimization operations with a correspondent node, allowing direct communication and avoiding traffic delivery via the home agent. The binding update mechanism is also used by correspondent nodes to dynamically learn and cache the mobile node's current binding. When sending a packet to the mobile node, a correspondent node checks its cached bindings for an entry for the packet's destination address. If a cached binding is found, the node uses an IPv6 Routing Header [6] to route the packet to the mobile node via the care-of address. If no cached binding is found, the node sends the packet normally (i.e., to the mobile node's home address with no routing header), and the packet is subsequently intercepted and tunneled to the mobile node by its home agent.

### 2.2 Redirect Attacks
In this paper, we focus on redirect attacks and their countermeasures in MIPv6. We do not consider other security issues such as data confidentiality, data integrity, and user authentication, as they are beyond the scope of MIPv6 and can be provided by IPsec or higher layers. We classify redirect attacks in MIPv6 into two categories: Session Hijacking and Malicious Mobile Node Flooding, as depicted in Figure 2.

#### 1. Session Hijacking
In the session hijacking redirect attack (Figure 2(a)), we assume a mobile node MN1 is communicating with a correspondent node CN. An intruder sends a forged or replayed binding update message to CN, claiming that MN1 has moved to a new care-of address belonging to another node MN2. If CN accepts the fake binding update, it will start communicating with MN2 instead of MN1. This is an "outsider" attack, as the intruder tries to redirect other nodes' traffic, potentially leading to information leakage, impersonation of MN1, or flooding of MN2.

#### 2. Malicious Mobile Node Flooding
In the malicious mobile node flooding attack (Figure 2(b)), an intruder (a malicious mobile node) sends valid binding update messages to its correspondent nodes CN1 and CN2, claiming it has moved to the Victim's location. The Victim can be a node or a network. For example, the intruder could initiate requests to video streaming servers, flooding the Victim's node or network by redirecting traffic from the video servers. This attack is an "insider" attack, as the malicious mobile node is a legitimate mobile node in its home link, and its actions are "legal" binding update operations.

We note that these attacks can also target the home agents of mobile nodes. By sending forged or malicious binding update messages to a mobile node's home agent, an intruder can cause the home agent to forward traffic to incorrect locations, leading to similar security issues.
