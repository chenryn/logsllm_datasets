# Wired CSV, misc, 220 points

We have a photo and a CSV file. **Note:** The flag does not follow the CTF{...} format but is clearly marked as the flag. Please manually add the CTF{...} around the flag when submitting.

The chip in the attached photo is identified as POKEY, which interfaces with the keyboard on an Atari system. We also received a CSV file containing logic dumps of several pins, specifically D0-D5 and select lines. By examining the state of the Dx pins when the select line is active, we can obtain raw keyboard codes. Using a code-to-character mapping found online, we were able to create a Python script, `read.py`, to decode the keyboard inputs and extract the flag.
