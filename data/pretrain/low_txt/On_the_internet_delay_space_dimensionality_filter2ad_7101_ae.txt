### Component Analysis and Network Decomposition

Upon applying the same decomposition analysis to the great-circle distances of the subnetworks, we observe no statistically significant difference in the power-law exponent of the subnetworks compared to the pair count and set cover exponents found for the combined network.

It is important to emphasize that the AS (Autonomous System) relationship graph is complex. Therefore, other forms of decomposition could result in pieces that display optimal dimensionality reduction. Nevertheless, the analysis presented here provides statistically significant evidence that the presence of Tier-1 transit links has a non-negligible effect on the Internet's delay space geometry.

Interestingly, both fractal measures are sensitive enough to capture this structural change, manifesting as a reduction in fractal dimension when one restricts attention to a subset of the delay space consisting of a single Tier-1 provider and its downstream networks. Table 2 also contains values for the percentage variance explained by the first three components (i.e., the three greatest in magnitude) found by PCA. Notice that, unlike the fractal measures, there is no clear distinction in dimensionality behavior between the subnetworks and the random sets as reported by PCA. We have also computed the embedding dimension of each network in Euclidean space using Vivaldi and did not observe any effect on the embedding dimensionality from decomposing the network into subnetworks. In fact, similar to PCA, in some cases, the dimensionality of subnetworks is reported as being much greater than that of the entire network.

### Hypotheses for Insensitivity of PCA and Vivaldi

We hypothesize three possible explanations for the insensitivity of PCA and Vivaldi to the network decomposition, which was otherwise well captured by the fractal measures:
1. **Non-linear Relationships**: PCA and Vivaldi are oblivious to non-linear relationships in delay space.
2. **Linear Approximations**: These methods try to represent non-linear relationships using linear ones, causing the dimensionality to inflate.
3. **Coarse Reporting**: PCA and Vivaldi report an integer summarizing the dataset’s dimensionality, which is too coarse to detect subtle differences, such as a 0.2 change in dimensionality.

To confirm our hypotheses, we applied Isomap (see Section 4.3.3) to the networks. Figure 7 shows the outcome of this experiment. The plot indicates that the fraction of the total variance explained by the first five (also the five most significant) components of all subnetworks is consistently greater than that of the entire network. Unlike PCA and Vivaldi, and in accordance with the fractal measures, the dimensionality of the subnetworks is indeed consistently smaller than the dimensionality of the whole network. However, the dimensionality values reported by Isomap for all networks are still larger than those predicted by the fractal measures. This result suggests the presence of non-negligible non-linear structures in the delay space and indicates that methods sensitive to these structures might reflect the structural properties of the Internet with a higher degree of accuracy.

### Conclusion

This work studies different dimensionality measures and investigates the dimensionality observed in the Internet delay space, providing insights into some of the underlying causes. Characterizing the geometry of the delay space is critical for designing and analyzing effective coordinate-based positioning systems and also sheds light on the structural properties of the network.

We have observed that the Internet delay space displays special structural and statistical characteristics, adhering to a power-law that extends over a significant range of Internet distances, particularly intra-continental distances. Therefore, its dimensionality can be characterized using fractal measures, which are sensitive to both non-linear and linear structures in the delay space. Moreover, these measures are intrinsic properties of the delay space, independent of a target host metric space (e.g., Euclidean space). Thus, the delay space dimensionality can be measured without computing coordinates for points, and is not subject to dimensionality inflation caused by embedding algorithms.

We have used the proposed fractal measures to quantify the extent to which geodesic distances are reflected in the dimensionality of the Internet. We have also shown that, upon decomposing the Internet into subnetworks consisting of hosts that share an upstream Tier-1 autonomous system in common, we observe a reduction in the intrinsic dimensionality of the pieces. Both fractal measures were able to capture the role of the Internet's AS-level topology in determining its delay space geometry, a factor not revealed by previous methods.

### Future Work

For future work, we will explore the applicability of nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques originally developed in the machine learning and pattern recognition communities, such as [20, 41]. These methods, including the Isomap method briefly studied in Section 5.2 and more recent diffusion-based techniques [20], are based on metric embeddings that can reflect the intrinsic geometry of datasets and allow multiscale analysis for solving dimensionality reduction, clustering, and parametrization.

Finally, we expect that the future availability of more comprehensive datasets, containing a larger number of representatives, including hosts in edge networks, and path information (i.e., traceroutes), will allow us to better quantify the effectiveness of the fractal measures and discover subtle properties of the delay space geometry that cannot be fully contemplated via analyzing the King datasets.
