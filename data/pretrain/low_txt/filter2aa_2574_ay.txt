## Chapter 7: Online Maps
### Introduction
The advent of computing devices, mobile communications, and social media platforms has made it easier than ever to post and track geolocation information. Many electronic devices, including smartphones and wearable devices, come equipped with satellite tracking sensors. This chapter will cover how to exploit geolocation data to determine current and previous locations, and will introduce various online services and tools for tracking and researching geospatial information.

### The Basics of Geolocation Tracking
Geolocation tracking relies on satellite navigation systems, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS), GLONASS, BeiDou, and Galileo. These systems use geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) to pinpoint a location on Earth.

### How to Find GPS Coordinates on a Map
To find the GPS coordinates of any location using Google Maps:
1. Go to [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com).
2. Click anywhere on the map. A small box at the bottom will show the GPS coordinates.
3. For a closer view, click the coordinate numbers to see the target location and its mailing address.

**Note**: The first number represents latitude, and the second represents longitude. You can also use [iTouchMap](http://itouchmap.com/latlong.html) or [Andrew Hedges' Converter](https://andrew.hedges.name/experiments/convert_lat_long) for additional options.

### How to Find Geocode Coordinates from a Mailing Address
If you have a mailing address but need geocode coordinates, use these services:
- **Batch Geocoding (https://www.doogal.co.uk/BatchGeocoding.php)**: Converts multiple addresses into geocode coordinates.
- **GPS Visualizer’s Quick Geocoder (www.gpsvisualizer.com/geocode)**: Converts addresses into geocode coordinates for both Google and Bing maps.
- **Batch Reverse Geocoding (https://www.doogal.co.uk/BatchReverseGeocoding.php)**: Converts geocode coordinates into approximate mailing addresses.
