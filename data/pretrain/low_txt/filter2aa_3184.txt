# Robot Shark Laser! Hackerspace Panel Introduction

## What is a Hackerspace?
A hackerspace is a community-operated workspace where people with common interests, often in computers, technology, science, digital art, or electronic art, can meet, socialize, and collaborate. Key aspects include:
- **Physical Forum**: A dedicated space for members to gather.
- **Collaborative Projects**: Members work together on various projects.
- **Community**: A diverse group of friends, hackers, and tech enthusiasts.
- **DIY Exchange**: Sharing skills and information.
- **References**: CCC, Makezine, DIY, Dorkbot, HackLab.

## Panel Members
- **Noid** - The Black Lodge, Seattle, WA, US
- **Leigh Honeywell** - Hacklab.TO, Toronto, Canada

### A Note About the Panel
We did not receive any volunteers from the Middle East, Asia, Africa, or South America. We aimed for as much diversity as possible within the available pool.

## Baseline: About Us

### Beth - Freeside, Atlanta, GA
- **Freeside** is a non-profit hackerspace in Atlanta, distinct from Freeside.it.
- **Founding**: Started by friends from Columbus, GA, and dc404, including members from 404.se2600, ALE (Atlanta Linux Enthusiasts), Atlanta Perl Mongers, AtlantaArduino, Dorkbot ATL, Botlanta, and NAISG.
- **Growth**: Began 6 months ago with 3 friends meeting weekly at a bar. Now, we have an impressive venue, 50 members, and are working on space-related projects.
- **Policies**: Adopted CV&Bs from MindSpring and a Hackerspace Manifesto. Basic safety rules include "be safe."
