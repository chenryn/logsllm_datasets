### Cloning Protection and Security Analysis of Passport Cards and Washington State EDLs

#### 1. Cloning Protection
We have successfully cloned both a Passport Card and a Washington State Enhanced Driver's License (EDL) onto commercially available, off-the-shelf RFID tags from the same manufacturers as the originals. By "cloned," we mean that the Electronic Product Code (EPC) and Tag Identifier (TID) values are reported identically by the cloned tags. Additionally, we inferred and duplicated the lock state of both card types. The only contents that we were unable to clone were the ACCESS PIN on both cards and the KILL PIN of the Passport Card.

The TID, therefore, does not serve as an effective anti-cloning tool as envisioned by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). One possible explanation is that DHS learned of the existence of tag-unique TIDs too late for incorporation into these cards. We maintain that characterizing the full, tag-specific TID as a powerful anti-cloning tool is overly optimistic in the long term. While tag-specific TIDs may prevent simple copying of one EPC into another, they do not prevent the emulation of an EPC tag in another radio device. An ordinary RFID reader makes no distinction between a tag embodied in a flake of silicon and one emulated by a larger, more powerfully instrumented platform.

General-purpose tag emulation platforms, such as OpenPCD and the RFID Guardian, already exist for High-Frequency (HF) tags. It is only a matter of time before similar tools emerge for Gen-2 EPC tags. For example, the Intel WISP is a physically compact RFID platform with a fully programmable microprocessor that operates in the Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) domain as a Gen-1 EPC tag, and a version that simulates a Gen-2 EPC tag is now available. Thus, emulator devices are likely to be broadly accessible in the coming years.

The decision to forego the security offered by the TID in the Washington State EDL and Passport Card increases the short-term risks of cloning, as it eliminates a basic protection against the straightforward copying of publicly viewable values into a fresh Gen-2 tag. In the longer term, commercially available emulator devices may reduce the protective value of tag-specific TIDs. However, the TID may still have some longer-term value as a countermeasure to easy cloning of EDLs and Passport Cards into devices with the same form factor, i.e., Gen-2-equipped cards.

#### 2. Other Memory Banks
Assuming the Gen-2 tags in the EDL and Passport Card are identical to the commercial, off-the-shelf tags indicated by their TID, the only read-protected pieces of memory on the cards are the KILL PIN on the Passport Card and the ACCESS PIN on both. We have experimentally verified that the entire EPC memory bank (which contains the card’s unique EPC value) is readable, as is the TID memory bank. The Impinj Monza chip does not have a User memory bank, and the Alien Higgs-2 chip only uses a User memory bank when the KILL and ACCESS PINs are not used. We have also verified that the cards report a “no such memory location” error when attempting to read words we do not expect to be present (such as the User memory bank).

#### 3. KILL-PIN Selection
The KILL PIN is unprogrammed and not locked on the Washington State EDLs. We have verified that we can directly write this 32-bit KILL PIN. We have not verified that we can actually kill an EDL (an experiment that would be detrimental to its owner). However, we have verified our ability to kill a cloned EDL with an identical Gen-2 tag model, an Impinj Monza, over the air. Thus, unless the Washington State EDL Gen-2 tag is specially manufactured—which seems unlikely, given the presence of a generic TID—it is subject to over-the-air killing by any reader.

Alternatively, an attacker can exploit the KILL PIN as a covert channel. They can set it as desired, thereby "marking" the EDL bearer with a 32-bit value accessible to any other reader.

#### 4. Read-Range Experiments
To the best of our knowledge, prior to our work, there has been no adversarial study of read capabilities for EPC tags—whether EDLs and Passport Cards or otherwise. Read ranges are a major determinant of the vulnerability of an EDL or Passport Card to clandestine cloning attacks, as well as attacks against privacy. A single scan of a tag in either type of identity document is sufficient to create a clone. To mitigate resulting privacy concerns, the United States Department of State provides radio-opaque shielding sleeves with each Passport Card, which attenuate the distance at which a card may be read. Similarly, Washington State is making protective sleeves available to holders of its EDLs.

It is uncertain whether EDL and Passport Card bearers will consistently use their protective sleeves. These documents require security hygiene beyond that of other commonly carried cards, demanding heightened vigilance and tolerance of inconvenience from bearers. The body of relevant literature on the psychology of fear appeals suggests that the abstract warnings accompanying EDLs and Passport Cards, such as the injunction on the Passport Card that, "Your Passport Card should be kept in its protective sleeve when not in use," may be relatively ineffective in stimulating sleeve use.

We evaluated the read range of the Passport Card and Washington State EDL in several different physical environments, including indoors, in a corridor, and outdoors. We also evaluated various ways of carrying the cards, such as held away from the body, inside a purse, in a wallet, and in a backpack. We used Secure SleevesTM from Identity Stronghold, the manufacturer supplying sleeves for both the Passport Card and the Washington State EDL. All shielded experiments were performed in the lab.

To perform these experiments, we used an Impinj Speedway R1000 reader, with a Cushcraft S9028PCL circularly-polarized antenna. The effective radiated power of the antenna was 36 dBm, the maximum allowed by the FCC. The center of the antenna was 88 cm off the ground, and the cards were placed directly in front of the antenna. We measured the maximum distance at which we could read the cards when held in place for up to five seconds. We report these maximum distances in Tables 1 (unshielded), Table 2 (shielded with the purchased Secure SleevesTM), and Table 3 (shielded with the sleeves provided for use with the respective cards).

#### 5. Defensive Directions: Backward-Compatible Cloning Defenses
The Class-1 Gen-2 specification has no explicit anti-cloning features. For this reason, Juels proposes co-opting two Gen-2 access-control commands for authentication of tags. We focus this section on evaluating and extending these protection mechanisms for EPC tags in general, regardless of deployment scenarios, and then refine our focus on how to apply these general results to EDLs and Passport Cards in particular.

1. **KILL Command**: The KILL command is designed to protect consumer privacy by allowing tags to be disabled at the point of sale in retail environments. When a tag successfully receives the KILL command along with a tag-specific 32-bit KILL PIN (Pkill), it becomes permanently inoperative. Co-opting KILL for tag authentication, a reader with knowledge of Pkill can authenticate a tag by constructing an invalid PIN (P'kill) and transmitting the pair (P'kill, Pkill) in a random order across two low-power kill command sessions. A valid tag will acknowledge the correct PIN and reject the incorrect PIN; an invalid one can respond correctly with probability at most 1/2. We refer to this idea as KILL-Based Authentication (KBA).

    While a detection probability of 1/2 is not high for an individual tag, it is high enough for detection of cloning on a systemic basis. By transmitting N − 1 spurious PINs and one legitimate one, at a linear cost in authentication time, a reader can boost its probability of detection of an invalid tag to 1 − 1/N.

    The challenge of KBA is the reliable transmission of commands in the low-power regime of a target tag. Too much power, and the tag will be killed. Too little, and the tag will not respond. To the best of our knowledge, KBA has remained a research proposal and has not yet seen empirical study. We fill this gap here.

2. **ACCESS Command**: EPC tags can carry secret data D with read-access control. Such data are readable only through use of the ACCESS command, with an accompanying tag-specific 32-bit PIN (Paccess). The KILL PIN itself is one such piece of read-protected data. Recall that the Passport Card we analyzed has both of these PINs set and locked. The Washington State EDL could have its KILL PIN set and locked over-the-air at the border (its ACCESS PIN is already set and locked).

    Co-opting ACCESS for tag authentication, an entity with knowledge of Paccess for a tag as well as D can authenticate the tag by checking D. An entity without knowledge of Paccess cannot extract D without physically attacking the tag. This mode of authentication is a kind of one-time challenge-response that we refer to as ACCESS-based authentication (ABA).

    We performed an experiment to determine whether ABA would impact read range. We used a new Impinj Monza tag for this experiment. We first determined the maximum read range of the tag outdoors. We then programmed Pkill and Paccess onto the tag, locked them against unsecured reading or writing, programmed the reader to use Paccess to read Pkill, and again measured the maximum read range. For our particular tag, we found a maximum read range of 475 cm in both instances, suggesting that ABA should not significantly impact read ranges.

    Variants are possible. For instance, without the presence of a secret D, a form of weak ABA is possible in which Paccess is used in the same mode as KBA, i.e., tested through embedding in a set of spurious PINs. This weak ABA is the only form that would seem generally viable in today’s EDL/Passport Card infrastructure. Passport Cards carry secret data D in the form of Pkill, but EDLs, as noted above, do not have their KILL PINs set.

    A stronger variant is possible as a form of crude rolling code created by overwriting D with a new random value D' on each authentication and storing this new value in a backend system. While an attacker could sniff D' and continue using a cloned card, once the legitimate card was read, the duplication of D' would be discovered.

**Advantages and Limitations**: Both KBA and ABA have advantages and disadvantages. KBA is of interest for two reasons. First, ACCESS is an optional command in the EPC standard, so tags need not support it. Second, it is possible to deploy the ABA and KBA independently. One entity can use Pkill to authenticate tags using KILL, but cannot perform tag cloning against a second, more privileged entity with knowledge of Paccess. For example, Pkill might be revealed to state law enforcement officials, allowing them to authenticate tags (and kill them), but not to clone them.

Neither technique is resistant to eavesdropping. They are ad-hoc tools meant to allow authentication in the absence of cryptography or other supporting features. The most compelling feature of KBA and ABA (where available) is their backward compatibility. Neither requires any modifications to already deployed EPC tags. Finally, KBA, if not carefully implemented, may in some cases actually kill the cards as a side-effect.
