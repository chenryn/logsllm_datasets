**First of all, thank you to all contributors.**

When I use the latest version to build my Node.js application, I need to debug it. However, after adding the `launch.json` file, the configuration does not appear in the launch configuration dropdown menu. 

I suspected that a restart of Visual Studio Code might resolve the issue, and indeed, after restarting, the problem was resolved. This may be a minor bug.

Thank you.
