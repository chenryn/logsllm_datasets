## How Did We Get Here?

### History of Stigma

  - Completed (instead of “successful”)
  - Was a victim of
  - Killed themselves

## Talking About Suicide

### Contagion
- **Definition:** Exposure to suicide or suicidal behavior directly or indirectly (via media) influences others to attempt suicide.

### Responsible Journalism & Social Media Standards
- **What We Should Say:**
  - Use "completed" or "died by" instead of "committed"
  - Do not present suicide as a means to a certain end, a valid coping mechanism, or an understandable solution to a specific problem
  - Avoid making venerating statements out of context (e.g., "She was a great kid with a bright future.")
  - Temper coverage of displays of grief
  - Promote coping strategies and post links to prevention resources

- **CDC Recommendations on Suicide Contagion & Reporting:**
  - Suicide is never the result of a single factor or event
  - It results from extremely complex interactions between psychological, social, and medical problems
  - It often stems from a long history of issues

### Important Terms
- **Suicidal Ideation:** Thoughts of suicide, varying in seriousness depending on specificity of plan
- **Suicidal Intent:** Subjective expectation and desire for a self-destructive act to end in death
- **Suicide Attempt:** Self-injurious behavior with intent to die, with non-fatal outcome
- **Aborted Suicide Attempt:** Potentially self-injurious behavior with intent to die, stopped before harm caused
- **Self Harm:** Willful infliction of painful, destructive, or self-injurious acts without intent to die
- **Lethality:** Likelihood of a specific act to cause death; perceived lethality often differs from objective lethality
- **Comorbidity:** Presence of one or more diseases or disorders in addition to a primary disease or disorder
- **Person in Crisis (PIC):** During an intervention, the distressed person
- **Risk Assessment:** Evaluation of risk and protective factors to determine potential suicide risk and mitigation recommendations
- **Threat Analysis:** Evaluation of the criticality of the current crisis situation, identification of prescriptive interventions

### Mental Illnesses Most Closely Related to Suicide
- **Mood Disorders:**
  - Depression
  - Major depression
  - Bipolar disorder (manic-depressive)
- **Schizophrenia:**
  - Auditory hallucinations, paranoid or bizarre delusions, significant social or occupational dysfunction
- **Personality Disorders:**
  - Cluster A: paranoia, anhedonia
  - Cluster B: antisocial, borderline, histrionic, narcissistic
  - Cluster C: avoidant, dependent, obsessive-compulsive
- **Anxiety Disorders:**
  - Continuous or episodic worries or fear about real or imagined events
  - Panic disorder, OCD, PTSD, social anxiety
- **Alcoholism / Substance Abuse:**
  - Physical dependence on drugs or alcohol

### A Quick Sidebar on Depression
- **Key Points:**
  - A period of depression is not the same as having a mood disorder
  - Online tests can help you self-diagnose and follow up with a professional
  - You don't need to be diagnosed with a mental illness to benefit from talking about life
  - Depressive (and manic) phases ebb and flow in severity; use calmer times to make a safety plan
  - Avoid well-intentioned slippery slopes:
    - "You have to cultivate happiness"
    - "We create the world around us"
    - "You just need more willpower"
  - People with mental illnesses can't "just snap out of it"

### Topics for Discussion
- Rational suicide
- Physician-assisted suicide
- (In)voluntarism of suicidal acts
- Free will, choice
- Genetic predispositions, heredity
- Harm reduction strategies
- Ethics of intervention and reporting
- Human rights concerns of involuntary commitment

**Keyword: Pragmatism**

### Underdiagnosis in Our Community
- **Startup Culture & "The Show":**
  - Mania is the desired state
  - Depression is stigmatized
  - Constant cycle of youth/burnout
  - Chronically under-insured
  - Drug/alcohol use is trivialized
  - "I'll sleep when I'm dead, too busy CRUSHING IT"

- **Underdiagnosis of Personality Disorders:**
  - Antisocial behavior
  - Paranoia
  - Isolation
  - Obsession
  - Expected, tolerated, encouraged, idolized
  - Trust is critical to therapeutic relationships
  - Access to dedicated mental health resources (possibly with clearance) in some U.S. Government agencies
  - Difficulty finding qualified resources in the private sector

## What Can We Do?

### Crowd-Sourced Intervention: A Fickle Mistress
- **Online Crisis Response:**
  - 30% of callers to suicide hotlines hang up
  - Efficacy appears equivalent, though data analysis is more difficult online
  - For basic users, somewhat more anonymous than phone
  - IMAlive has very consistent training
  - Volunteer pairing has the same "luck of the draw" as via phone

### Learn QPR Gatekeeper Training
- **Community Education Program:**
  - Not a form of counseling or treatment, but offers hope and referrals
  - Confronts common myths and encourages proactive intervention
  - Teaches common verbal, behavioral, and situational clues
  - Encourages participants to directly ask “The S Question”
  - Offers examples of how to persuade the PIC to accept help
  - Instructs participants on how to make a relevant referral
  - QPR = Question | Persuade | Refer

### Crisis Intervention Tactics
- **Crisis Intervention Hotline vs. Frientervention:**
  - **Hotline:**
    - Person in Crisis (PIC) seeks you out
    - Assumes you are qualified, +1 to credibility
    - Interactions have finite bounds
    - Volunteers must remain anonymous
    - Therapists can set their hours of availability
    - Lack of personal involvement allows clarity

  - **Frientervention:**
    - You may need to proactively confront a friend
    - Friend sees you as a peer
    - Friends may have an expectation of "always on" access (IM, Email, Text, Phone, Residence)
    - Not reaching you can make them feel cut off or ignored
    - Personal involvement may introduce bias
    - Lack of improvement in their situation may degrade their perception of your credibility over time
    - Emotional exhaustion
