### Feature Request
Enable Whisper speech recognition without conditioning on previous text.

Reference:
[Whisper Transcribe Code](https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/7858aa9c08d98f75575035ecd6481f462d66ca27/whisper/transcribe.py#L278)

### Motivation
While the current implementation of Whisper is impressive, conditioning the decoding on previous text can lead to significant hallucinations and repetitive output. For example:

> "Do you have malpractice? Do you have malpractice? Do you have malpractice? Do you have malpractice? Do you have malpractice? Do you have malpractice? Do you have malpractice? Do you have malpractice? Do you have malpractice? Do you have malpractice? Do you have malpractice? Do you have malpractice? Do you have malpractice? Do you have malpractice? Do you have malpractice?"

By running OpenAI's model with the `--condition_on_previous_text False` flag, we can significantly reduce these issues.
