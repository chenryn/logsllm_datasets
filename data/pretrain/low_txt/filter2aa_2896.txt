## Purpose: Presentation and Toolkit

- **Smart Meter Data Acquisition Techniques**: Known since January 5, 2009
  - *Reference*: [Advanced Metering Infrastructure Attack Methodology](http://inguardians.com/pubs/AMI_Attack_Methodology.pdf)
  - Some vendors, utilities, and teams are still unaware of these techniques.
- **Tools to:**
  - Test functionality
  - Validate configuration
  - Generate anomalous data

---

## What Criminals Can Attack

- Access and alter data on the meter
- Gain access to wireless communications
- Subvert field hardware to impact internal resources

---

## Criminal Interest

- Free or reduced energy
- Corporate espionage
- Access to back-end resources
- Non-kinetic attacks
- Hacktivism

**Note:** Attacks via the optical port have already occurred.

## Where to Start?

- **Stealing a Meter?**
  - In Texas, stealing a meter can result in a Class B misdemeanor theft charge, with fines ranging from $50 to $500 and potential jail time.
- **C12.22 Protocol**
  - Obfuscated protocols

---

## OptiGuard Offspring?

- **Wireless Optical Port Readers**
  - Small, inexpensive magnetic devices activated wirelessly
- **Optical Port Spraying**
  - IR interaction without physical contact with the meter
- **Wireless Hardware Sniffers and Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Devices**
  - Detect and modify data in transit
- **Neighborhood Area Network FHSS Eavesdropping**
  - Channels, spacing, modulation, sync bytes, etc.
