# Frontpage: Laying the Groundwork

## Overview
Frontpage is an integrated web site development tool by Microsoft, designed to add basic to advanced functionality with minimal web page experience. It is part of the MS Office package but has been a security nightmare.

### What is Frontpage?
- **Definition**: An integrated web site development tool.
- **Functionality**: Adds basic to advanced features with little or no web page experience.
- **Integration**: Part of the MS Office package.
- **Security Concerns**: Known for numerous vulnerabilities.

## Vermeer Technologies
- **History**: In early 1995, Vermeer Technologies developed one of the first web publishing tools, Frontpage.
- **Acquisition**: The application was later acquired by Microsoft and integrated into the Office suite.

## Decoding the System
### Protocol Analysis
- **Client/Server Communication**: Frontpage client and server extensions communicate over HTTP PUT requests.
- **Key Components**:
  - **Author.dll**: Handles authoring commands, uploading, downloading content, reviewing properties, and adding enhancements.
  - **Admin.dll**: Manages admin commands such as adding users, modifying permissions, and listing accounts.
  - **Shtml.exe, vti_rpc**: Facilitates initial access and service negotiation.

### Authentication System
- **Process**: Authentication occurs with each request (login, upload, download, change permissions, navigate folders, etc.).
- **Resource Usage**: While resource-intensive, it limits state-based attacks.

## _vti_inf.html
- **Purpose**: Provides configuration information and helps determine the server's operating system.
- **Guidelines**:
  - Files with references to `.exe` tools likely reside on Unix servers.
  - Files with references to `.dll` tools likely reside on Windows servers.
- **Version Table**:
  - **Windows 98/ME Personal Webserver**: Version unknown.
  - **Windows NT 4.0**: Version 4.x.
  - **Windows 2000**: Version 5.x.
  - **Windows XP**: Version 5.x.

## Understanding Vermeer RPC Packets
- **Structure**: Responses from Frontpage Server Extensions come in the form of Vermeer RPC Packets, which resemble HTML pages.
- **Information Coding**: Data is encoded within HTML tags.
- **Sample Packet**: Contains physical drive locations, useful for Unicode exploits.

## Knocking on the Door: Custom Tools
### fpxploiter
- **Description**: A Perl-Gtk scanning tool for identifying vulnerable Frontpage-accessible webservers.
- **Capabilities**:
  - Locating webservers with default or user-defined credentials.
  - Identifying servers without passwords or with weak passwords.
- **Usage**:
  - **Start**: Run `fpxploiter`.
  - **Target List**: Select File -> Set Targets or press Ctrl-T.
  - **Password List**: Select File -> Set Password List.
  - **User Account**: Select File -> Set User account.
  - **Export Results**: Select File -> Save Log after scanning.

## Future Directions
- **Support for Apache Frontpage Extensions**.
- **Redesign**: Provide a generic Frontpage access library.
- **Rebuild**: Consider C/Gtk or C++/QT.
- **Content Upload Support**.

## Code Availability
- **Website**: http://www.fpxploiter.org
- **DEFCON CD**: Available on the DEFCON CD.

## What to Do When You're There
### ASP for Hackers
- **SQL Server Database Hunting**:
  - **Tools**: Custom ASP pages for executing queries and exploring SQL Servers.
  - **Example**: `SQLUltimate.asp` for SQL analysis.
  - **Ideas**:
    - Add SQL Server users if in the System Admin role.
    - Access corporate data.
    - Execute extended stored procedures.
    - Locate application accounts and passwords.

### Command Line ASP
- **cmdasp.asp**: Executes console commands and returns results.
- **Examples**:
  - `netstat -a`
  - `ipconfig -all`
  - `net users`
  - `Net localgroup`
- **Ideas**:
  - Use `netstat -an` and `netstat -a` for makeshift reverse DNS.
  - Use `net localgroup` and `net view` to understand drive mappings and groups.
  - Use `ping` to find additional servers.

## Security Best Practices
- **Administrator Account**: Change the name of your Administrator account to something meaningful but not easily guessable.
- **Least Privilege**: Only provide necessary access. Use Frontpage roles to assign Author rights and reserve Admin rights for specific accounts.
- **IP Restrictions**: Use IIS native IP-based restrictions to block access to `admin.dll` and `author.dll` from external IP addresses.
