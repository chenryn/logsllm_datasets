### ntbackup Command

**Applies to:** Windows Server (All supported versions)

The `ntbackup` command is used to back up and restore files and system state from a command prompt. However, this command has been replaced by the `wbadmin` command in newer versions of Windows Server.

**Important Note:**
- Backups created using `ntbackup` cannot be recovered using the `wbadmin` command.
- To recover from backups created with `ntbackup`, you must use the Windows NT Backup - Restore utility.

For more information on the `wbadmin` command, please refer to the relevant documentation.
