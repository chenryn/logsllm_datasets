### Network Topology and Scalability

1. **Knowledge Sharing**: How can servers efficiently share their knowledge without constant communication, which is impractical in a large network?
2. **Network Topology**: If the number of servers is too high for each to communicate with every other, which non-clique topology should be used? Restricted-route topologies offer comparable anonymity with better scalability [13], but any chosen topology must prevent attackers from manipulating their position within it [21].
3. **Server Reliability**: In the absence of a central authority to track server reliability, how can we prevent unreliable servers from making the network unusable?
4. **Client Incentives**: Do clients receive sufficient anonymity by running their own Onion Routers (ORs) that we can expect all to do so [1], or do we need another incentive structure to motivate them? Tarzan and MorphMix present possible solutions.

### Node Failure and User Experience

When a Tor node fails, all its circuits (and thus streams) break. This brittleness may cause users to abandon the system. How effective is the method in Section 6.1 at allowing streams to survive node failure? If affected users immediately rebuild circuits, how much anonymity is lost? The problem is even more pronounced in a peer-to-peer environment, where there is no inherent incentive for peers to stay connected after retrieving content, leading to a higher churn rate.

### Future Directions

Tor integrates many innovations into a unified, deployable system. The next immediate steps include:

#### Scalability
- **Topology and Directories**: Tor's current design, which includes a clique topology, semi-centralized directories, and full-network-visibility for client knowledge, will not scale beyond a few hundred servers. Section 9 outlines some promising approaches, but more deployment experience is needed to understand the relative importance of these bottlenecks.

#### Bandwidth Classes
- **Bandwidth Management**: This paper assumes all ORs have good bandwidth and latency. Adopting the MorphMix model, where nodes advertise their bandwidth level (DSL, T1, T3), and Alice avoids bottlenecks by choosing nodes that match or exceed her bandwidth, would allow DSL users to usefully join the Tor network.

#### Incentives
- **Node Participation**: Volunteers who run nodes are rewarded with publicity and potentially better anonymity [1]. More nodes mean increased scalability and more users mean more anonymity. We need to continue examining the incentive structures for participating in Tor and explore more ways to limit abuse. Additionally, we need to understand why most people do not use privacy systems.

#### Cover Traffic
- **Security and Performance**: Currently, Tor omits cover traffic due to its performance and bandwidth costs, but the security benefits are not well understood. Further research on link-level and long-range cover traffic is necessary to determine if simple padding methods offer provable protection against our chosen adversary.

#### Caching at Exit Nodes
- **Anonymity and Efficiency**: Running a caching web proxy at each exit node could improve anonymity for cached pages (Alice’s request never leaves the Tor network), enhance speed, and reduce bandwidth costs. However, forward security is weakened because caches constitute a record of retrieved files. We must find the right balance between usability and security.

#### Directory Distribution
- **Incremental Updates**: Clients currently download a description of the entire network every 15 minutes. As the state grows larger and the number of clients increases, we may need a solution where clients receive incremental updates to directory state. More generally, we must find more scalable yet practical ways to distribute up-to-date snapshots of network status without introducing new attacks.

#### Specification Review
- **External Review**: Our public byte-level specification [20] needs external review. We hope that as Tor is deployed, more people will examine its specification.

#### Multisystem Interoperability
- **Unified Specifications**: We are working with the designer of MorphMix to unify the specification and implementation of the common elements of our two systems. So far, this seems relatively straightforward. Interoperability will allow testing and direct comparison of the two designs for trust and scalability.

#### Wider-Scale Deployment
- **User Feedback**: The original goal of Tor was to gain experience in deploying an anonymizing overlay network and learn from actual users. We are now at a point in design and development where we can start deploying a wider network. Once we have many actual users, we will be better able to evaluate our design decisions, including robustness/latency tradeoffs, performance tradeoffs (including cell size), abuse-prevention mechanisms, and overall usability.
