### Greed is Good

- **Gordon Gekko from the movie "Wall Street"**:
  - Fault-finding
  - Quarrelsome
  - Critical
  - Harsh
  - Aloof
  - Blunt
  - A real piece of work with a tagline of “Greed is Good”
  - Interestingly, several studies have shown a link between people at the top of organizations (e.g., CEOs) and low agreeableness. There's a great article in Bloomberg Business Week called “The Sociopath Network”.

### Corporate Personality Testing

- **Personality Testing in Corporations**:
  - Myers-Briggs assessments are almost ubiquitous in corporations.
  - Anecdotally, many corporate types administering the tests do not seem to understand their real value and limitations.
  - It’s important to stress that these tests are not worthless but can be dangerous when used in the wrong contexts without understanding their limitations.
  - **References**:
    - Book: *The Cult of Personality: How Personality Tests Are Leading Us to Miseducate Our Children, Mismanage Our Companies, and Misunderstand Ourselves* by Annie Murphy Paul
    - Note: This book focuses on finding issues, and the truth likely lies somewhere in the middle.

### Vetting

- **Pre-Employment Screening**:
  - Research indicates that personality testing is used in pre-employment screening and vetting.
  - Many corporate types administering the tests do not fully understand their value and limitations.
  - It’s important to stress that these tests are not worthless but can be dangerous when used in the wrong contexts without understanding their limitations.

### Cyber Vetting

- **Online Reputation (NetRep)**:
  - With the advent of mass social network use, blogging, etc. (almost 1 in 12 people around the world are on Facebook), it’s unsurprising to see organizations turn to cyber vetting.
  - They look at your online reputation to determine if you’d be a good choice or a bad one. Often, this is something a hiring manager would do themselves, whether legally or not.

### Social Intelligence

- **Social Intelligence**:
  - There are other companies like Social Intelligence.
  - I kind of like this company for a number of reasons. If you’re going to have someone look at your NetRep, it’s better that a company like this does it in a controlled manner following strict guidelines.

### Snoop: What Your Stuff Says About You

- **Book by Professor Sam Gosling**:
  - The book *Snoop* by Professor Sam Gosling at the University of Texas in Austin examines what people’s rooms/living spaces say about them.
  - For example, a messy living space can indicate a lower degree of conscientiousness, and motivational posters could indicate above-average levels of neuroticism.

### Facebook and Personality

- **Facebook Activity and Privacy**:
  - In his book, Professor Gosling touched on the relationship between personality traits and Facebook activity.
  - This raised privacy concerns and triggered my curiosity.

### Privacy Concerns

- **Privacy and Personality Testing**:
  - We have personality tests that often put people into neat boxes, but people don’t fit into neat boxes.
  - We have corporate types who love but don’t necessarily understand personality.
  - We have an explosion of social network usage.
  - We have companies cropping up to determine your NetRep on behalf of employers.
  - If you can determine personality traits from online activity without asking, we have a problem.

### The Big 5 Experiment

- **Research Project**:
  - Over a beer (several beers and some shots), my friend and co-founder of “The Online Privacy Foundation” and I discussed researching the extent to which you can predict personality from Facebook activity.
  - We spent 9 months and a lot of money developing a Facebook application and conducting our research.
  - **References**:

### The Big 5 Experiment Details

- **Application/Experiment**:
  - The application presents users with a 44-question personality test called “The Big Five Inventory” (BFI) by Oliver John.
  - We added a 45th question about privacy.
  - We requested and pulled down 74 Facebook data points, including photos, descriptions, biography, interests, friends, etc.
  - We examined the data using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC).

    - LIWC tools: [LIWC](http://www.liwc.net/)

### Data Analysis

- **Linguistic Analysis**:
  - LIWC examines the different types of words and punctuation used by people.
  - Example: Nick Clegg, the UK’s deputy prime minister, was analyzed during the last UK elections and found to be “the most vague.”

### Data Collection Challenges

- **Data Collection**:
  - Our app asks for a lot of information, more than typical apps like Farmville.
  - Other online personality studies also grab similar data, but we look at more.
  - We targeted participants through friends, family, Facebook advertising, tweeting, Digg, Reddit, and flyer distribution.
  - We ended up with data from 537 participants.
  - **References**:
    - The Big 5 Personality Experiment: [Online Privacy Foundation](https://www.onlineprivacyfoundation.org/?page_id=49)

### Data Analysis and Results

- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - We recruited a statistician, Ali B, to analyze the data.
  - Our null hypothesis was that there was no relationship between a person’s personality type, privacy concerns, and Facebook activity.
  - Our alternative hypothesis was that there was a relationship between these variables.

### Demographics

- **Demographic Data**:
  - The majority of respondents were from the US and Great Britain.
  - Over 2/3 of participants were female, which differs from the general Facebook population.
  - The age distribution was representative of the overall Facebook user base.

### Normal Distribution

- **Statistical Overview**:
  - Before proceeding, I’ll provide a brief overview of the normal distribution.
  - The normal distribution is a bell-shaped curve, and many variables follow this pattern, such as height, weight, and IQ scores.
  - The mean, mode, and median of a normal distribution are all the same.
  - Standard deviation measures the spread of values across the bell curve.
