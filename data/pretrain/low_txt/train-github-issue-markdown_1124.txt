**Current Behavior**  
Currently, script tags are removed from component templates, which prevents the implementation of JSON-LD tags.

For further discussion on this topic, please see [this link] and issue #2766.

**Expected/Desired Behavior**  
When using Angular Universal or in scenarios with pure client-side rendering, there should be a method for Angular 2 users to implement JSON-LD tags for SEO purposes. At present, this is not feasible.

**Motivation/Use Case for Changing the Behavior**  
Google recommends using JSON-LD for structured data. The alternative, microdata, is less ideal as it would require distributing the data across multiple, if not all, component templates.
