**Abstract:**
The 7th ACM International Workshop on Cyber Security Analytics, Intelligence, and Automation (SafeConfig) is being held as part of the ACM Computer and Communications Security (CCS) conference in 2014. Building on the success of previous workshops, SafeConfig 2014 focuses on developing innovative security techniques and approaches that offer proactive, intelligent, and holistic security analytics. These methods analyze system artifacts such as system traces, configurations, logs, incident reports, alarms, and network traffic. Scalable analytics are essential to manage large volumes of data, normalize, model, integrate, analyze, and respond to threats in real time.

**Categories and Subject Descriptors:**
H.1.0 [Information Systems]: Models and Principles

**Keywords:**
Security Analytics, Automation, Cyber Intelligence

**1. Motivation:**
Ensuring the correctness and integrity of system configurations and associated policies is crucial for the proper functioning, accessibility, security, privacy, and resilience of modern information systems and services. This task is particularly challenging in large enterprise systems, which may contain millions of physical and virtual components that must be properly configured and secured from unauthorized access. Additionally, configuration variables often have explicit or hidden interdependencies that must be understood to ensure proper end-to-end behavior.

New sophisticated cyber security threats require advanced security techniques and approaches that provide proactive, intelligent, and holistic security analytics. These methods should be capable of analyzing system artifacts, including system traces, configurations, logs, incident reports, alarms, and network traffic. Scalable analytics techniques are essential to handle large volumes of data and to normalize, model, integrate, analyze, and respond to threats in real time. As technology evolves towards "smart" cyber infrastructure and open networking platforms (e.g., OpenFlow and virtual computing), and with the integration of a wide variety of sensors, the need for large-scale security analytics and automation becomes increasingly critical. This year, SafeConfig is being held in conjunction with the CCS (Computing and Communications Security) conference, scheduled for November 3-7, 2014, in Scottsdale, Arizona.

**2. Description:**
This workshop provides a unique opportunity by bringing together researchers from academia, industry, and government agencies to discuss the challenges, exchange experiences, and propose joint plans for promoting research and development in this area. SafeConfig is a one-day forum that includes invited talks, technical presentations of peer-reviewed papers, poster/demo sessions, and joint panels on research collaboration. Initiated in 2009, SafeConfig has been continuously running and serves as a platform to explore theoretical foundations, algorithmic advances, modeling, and evaluation of configuration-related challenges for large-scale cyber and cyber-physical systems.

The workshop features a keynote talk on the future development of security analytics, an expert panel discussion on security automation from sense-making to decision-making, and two technical sessions:

- **Security Analytics for Sense Making:**
  - The first session focuses on web application security, spam detection, and the security of software repositories.
  - P. Chen et al. [2] analyze the security of the Chinese web by investigating the usage of client-side security policies through a large-scale analysis of the 10,000 most popular Chinese websites. Their research reveals that a significant fraction of Chinese websites lag behind in adopting good security practices.
  - F. Gillani and E. Al-Shaer [3] introduce an economic metric to assist spam detectors in reducing false positives by associating detection accuracy with the spammer's cost. Their approach is effective in significantly reducing false positives.
  - J. Tate and T. Charles Clancy [6] discuss the integration of Keyless Signature Infrastructure (KSI) technology with the git source code management software to create software repository systems resistant to insider attacks.

- **Analytics for Automated Mitigation:**
  - The second session focuses on attack analysis and risk assessment.
  - M. Alsaleh and E. Al-Shaer [1] present an objective metric to assess the risk of cyberattacks on computer networks, leveraging security compliance and Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) languages.
  - K. Sun and S. Jajodia [4] propose a new attack surface expansion mechanism that increases the external attack surface, making it difficult for external attackers to identify the real internal attack surface.
  - Y. Tanaka [5] proposes a method to efficiently detect Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) attack code, a core technique used in zero-day attacks, on the network side.

**3. Concluding Remarks:**
The 7th ACM International Workshop on Cyber Security Analytics, Intelligence, and Automation (SafeConfig) brings together practitioners and researchers in security, analytics, formal methods, control theory, and artificial intelligence to share ideas and experiences for security analytics and automation. We hope that the selected papers will serve as a valuable reference for future research on these groundbreaking ideas.
