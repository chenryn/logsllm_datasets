I have been using Julia 1.0 via the Terminal and Jupyter on my previous version of macOS. After upgrading to Catalina 10.15.2, I can still use Julia 1.0 in the Terminal. However, when attempting to run the newer version, Julia 1.3, I encounter the following alert:

> “Julia-1.3” can’t be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software.

To resolve this issue, I was able to bypass the alert by manually approving the application within "System Preferences > Security & Privacy." 

I suspect that this issue is related to the new app notarization requirements introduced in Catalina. If anyone has encountered and resolved a similar problem, I would appreciate your insights. In the meantime, perhaps the installation instructions for Julia could be updated to address this potential hurdle.
