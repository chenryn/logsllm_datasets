### ICS/SCADA Cybersecurity vs. IT Cybersecurity
- **Operational Technology (OT):** Hardware and software that detects or causes changes through the direct monitoring and/or control of physical devices, processes, and events in the enterprise.
  - **Gartner:** Monitors and controls how physical devices perform.
  - **Wikipedia:** Dedicated to detecting or causing changes in physical processes through direct monitoring and/or control of physical devices such as valves, pumps, etc.

---

### What is an Industrial Control System (ICS)?
- **Definition:** A term used to encompass various applications and uses of industrial and facility control and automation systems.
- **ISA-99/IEC 62443:** Includes personnel, hardware, and software that can affect or influence the safe, secure, and reliable operation of an industrial process.
- **NIST:** Encompasses several types of control systems, including SCADA, DCS, and PLCs, often found in industrial sectors and critical infrastructures.

---

### Industries Using ICS
- Electrical and nuclear plants
- Wastewater treatment plants
- Oil and natural gas
- Transportation
- Air traffic control
- Manufacturing
- Food and beverage
- And more

---

### Types of ICS
- **BAS:** Building Automation Systems
- **DCS:** Distributed Control Systems
- **SCADA:** Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
- **HMI:** Human-Machine Interface
- **SIS:** Safety Instrumented Systems
- **PLC:** Programmable Logic Controllers
- **RTU:** Remote Terminal Units
- **IED:** Intelligent Electronic Devices

---

### The Need to Secure ICS
- **Consequences of Security Incidents:**
  - Risk of death and serious injury
  - Loss of production
  - Environmental impact
  - Manipulation or loss of data
  - Damage to company image/reputation
  - Financial loss

---

### IT-OT Convergence
- **Historical Context:**
  - IT and OT were traditionally managed separately.
  - ICS developed using specialized hardware and proprietary software.
  - Deployed as standalone platforms with vendor-specific communication protocols.
- **Benefits:**
  - Reduced manufacturing and operational costs
  - Increased productivity
  - Real-time information access
  - Modern networking systems interconnecting ICS with business and external networks
  - Use of commercial-off-the-shelf equipment and software

---

### Challenges in IT-OT Convergence
- **Vulnerabilities:**
  - Integration of Windows OS, SQL, and Ethernet makes ICS vulnerable to viruses, worms, and trojans.
  - Legacy ICS integration means they are vulnerable to attacks not designed for.
  - Not all IT security solutions are suitable for ICS due to fundamental differences.
- **Operational Availability:**
  - Difficult and costly to interrupt systems for security updates.
  - ICS lifecycle typically 10 to 20 years, often not built with security in mind.
  - Firmware and software rarely updated, patches seldom applied.
- **Patching and Updates:**
  - Requires testing, approval, scheduling, and validation.
  - All updates must be thoroughly tested before installation.
  - Often includes safety instrumented systems (SIS).
- **Vendor Support and Access:**
  - Default configuration settings by outside vendors.
  - Demand for 24/7 remote access increases insecure or rogue connections.
  - Manuals on ICS equipment are publicly available.

---

### Standards and Best Practices for ICS
- **Examples:**
  - **API-1164:** Pipeline SCADA Security
  - **National ICS Security Standard (Qatar):** Version 3, March 2014
  - **ASD Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents:** February 2017

---

### Industrial Cyber Security Assessment
- **Starting Point:**
  - Risk and security assessments
  - Analyze current state from technologies to policies, procedures, and behavior
  - Offer a realistic picture of your security posture and required mitigation techniques

---

### Cyber Security Assessment & Tools
- **NIST Framework:**
  - Voluntary guidance for critical infrastructure organizations
  - Five essential program activities: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover
- **CSET (Cyber Security Evaluation Tool):**
  - Free desktop software from ICS-CERT (of DHS)
  - Evaluates ICS and IT network security practices based on industry standards

---

### System Controls in ICS
- **Defense-in-Depth Approach:**
  - Multiple layers of defense: physical, procedural, and electronic
  - Layers include policies, procedures, awareness, physical security, network security, computer hardening, application security, and device hardening

---

### ICS Security Architecture
- **Purdue Model for Control Hierarchy:**
  - Logical framework using zones to subdivide Enterprise and ICS networks into logical segments
  - Levels: Enterprise, Site Business Planning, Site Manufacturing Operations, Area Supervisory Control, Basic Control, Process, Safety Zone, DMZ

---

### Network Security
- **Controls:**
  - Network segmentation or zoning
  - Industrial firewalls
  - Cater to different OPC ports
  - Network Intrusion Detection and Protection Systems (IDS, IPS)

---

### Industrial Protocols
- **Process:**
  - PROFINET, CIP (Common Industrial Protocol), EtherNet/IP, HART, Modbus
- **Industrial:**
  - OPC (OLE for Process Control)
- **Building:**
  - BACnet
- **Power:**
  - DNP3, IEC 61850
- **Automobile:**
  - CAN Bus (Controller Area Network)

---

### Security Applications for ICS
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**
  - Anomaly-based detection
  - Identifies deviations from normal behavior
  - Uses machine learning to form a baseline of normal network traffic
- **Industrial Firewalls:**
  - Examples: 3eTI CyberFence Family, WurldTech OpShield, Tofino Xenon, Phoenix Contact mGuard Series, Moxa EDR Series
- **Data Diodes:**
  - Examples: Waterfall Security, Fox-IT, Nexor, Vado
- **ICS Anomaly Detection:**
  - Examples: SecurityMatters, Claroty, Darktrace, Dragos

---

### Benefits of Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) for OT
- **Enhanced Visibility:**
  - Beyond traditional firewalls (data flow, commands, values, etc.)
- **Enforced Rules:**
  - On commands and values consistent with process rules
- **Lockdown:**
  - Unused functionality (commands/registers)
- **Detection and Protection:**
  - Configuration/firmware changes to ICS endpoints
- **Validation:**
  - Messages per protocol standards
- **Limitation:**
  - Messages and commands to unsafe operational scenarios
- **Reduction of Human Error:**
  - Passive implementation reduces risk of interrupting existing systems
- **Holistic Baseline:**
  - For interconnected systems for application whitelisting

---

### Summary
- **Integration:**
  - Cybersecurity needs to be an integral part of IT/OT convergence.
- **Separate Management:**
  - IT and OT were traditionally supported and managed separately.
- **Challenges:**
  - Legacy technology, lack of security capabilities in OT devices.
- **Risk Reduction:**
  - Reduce attack surface and exploitation likelihood.
- **Impact Mitigation:**
  - Eliminate or reduce impact causing loss of lives, equipment damage, environmental impact.
- **Resilience:**
  - Have a backup operational mode.
