**Book Overview:**

*Black Hat Go* explores the darker side of Go, a programming language renowned for its simplicity, efficiency, and reliability. This book is designed to equip security practitioners and hackers with practical tactics and tools using the power of Go. It covers a wide range of topics, from basic syntax and tool development to advanced techniques like cryptography, packet sniffing, and exploit development.

**Key Features:**
- **Basic Syntax and Philosophy:** Start with an overview of Go’s syntax and philosophy.
- **Tool Development:** Learn to develop tools that interact with common network protocols such as HTTP, DNS, and SMB.
- **Penetration Testing Tactics:** Address common issues faced by penetration testers, including data pilfering, packet sniffing, and exploit development.
- **Cryptography and Steganography:** Dive into advanced topics like cryptography, steganography, and attacking Microsoft Windows.
- **Practical Examples:** Create dynamic, pluggable tools and implement various security techniques.

**What You Will Learn:**
- Develop high-performance tools for your security projects.
- Build tools that interact with remote APIs.
- Scrape arbitrary HTML data.
- Use Go’s standard `net/http` package to build HTTP servers.
- Write your own DNS server and proxy.
- Implement DNS tunneling to establish a command-and-control (C2) channel in restrictive networks.
- Create a vulnerability fuzzer to discover security weaknesses.
- Future-proof products with plugins and extensions.
- Build an RC2 symmetric-key brute-forcer.
- Implant data within a Portable Network Graphics (PNG) image.
