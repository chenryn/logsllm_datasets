## Abstract

We present a system designed and implemented for secure web content publication. Our system ensures that it is extremely difficult for any adversary to censor or modify the published content. Additionally, the identity of the publisher is protected once the content is posted. Unlike other systems, Publius provides tools for updating or deleting published content, and users can browse the content using a standard web browser and a client-side proxy we provide. All of our code is freely available.

## 1. Introduction

The dissemination of written content has long been a powerful tool for spreading new and often controversial ideas, driving social change. The printing press and, more recently, the World Wide Web, have been instrumental in this process. However, those who seek to suppress such revolutions also wield powerful tools, enabling them to stop, destroy, or prevent the distribution of publications. Even if censorship is not successful, they may intimidate or harm the author or publisher to discourage others from similar actions. Authors may also wish to publish anonymously or pseudonymously to avoid discrimination based on gender, race, or other characteristics.

Quotations about the Internet’s ability to resist censorship and promote anonymity are common. John Gilmore’s famous quote, “The Net treats censorship as damage and routes around it,” suggests that the Internet cannot be censored. Similarly, Peter Steiner’s New Yorker cartoon, “On the Internet, nobody knows you’re a dog,” highlights the perceived anonymity of the Internet. However, unless extraordinary precautions are taken, online writings can be censored, and the true identities behind pseudonyms can be revealed.

Examples of the Internet’s limited resistance to censorship include the Church of Scientology’s efforts to suppress critical documents. Since 1994, the Church has used legal and extralegal means to remove such documents from the Internet. In 1995, the Church convinced Finnish authorities to reveal the identity of an anonymous remailer user, leading to the shutdown of the service. The U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) further enables censorship by requiring online service providers to remove allegedly infringing content upon notification, even before the claim is verified.

To address these issues, we developed Publius, a web publishing system that is highly resistant to censorship and provides a high degree of anonymity. Publius is named after the pen name used by the authors of the Federalist Papers, who published their influential articles pseudonymously in New York State newspapers from October 1787 to May 1788.

### 1.1 Design Goals

Nine key design goals shaped the development of Publius:

- **Censorship Resistance:** It should be extremely difficult for third parties to alter or delete published content.
- **Tamper Evident:** Unauthorized changes to published materials should be detectable.
- **Source Anonymity:** The identity of the publisher should be protected once the content is published.
- **Updatable:** Publishers should be able to update or delete their own content.
- **Deniable:** Third parties involved in the system should be able to deny knowledge of the published content.
- **Fault Tolerant:** The system should continue to function even if some participants are malicious or faulty.
- **Persistent:** Content should be publishable indefinitely without setting an upfront expiration date.
- **Extensible:** The system should support the addition of new features and participants.
- **Freely Available:** All required software should be freely available.

## 2. Related Work

Current web anonymizing tools can be categorized into two main types: connection-based and author-based. Connection-based tools hide the identity of the individual requesting a web page, while author-based tools conceal the location or author of a web document. Although Publius falls into the latter category, we briefly review both types as they can be used together to enhance anonymity.

### 2.1 Connection-Based Anonymity Tools

- **Anonymizer (http://www.anonymizer.com):** Acts as a proxy for HTTP requests, retrieving pages on behalf of the user and hiding their identity.
- **LPWA (Proxymate):** Similar to Anonymizer but also generates unique pseudonymous usernames and email addresses.
- **Mix Networks:** Use layered encryption and techniques like buffering and message reordering to obscure communication paths.
- **Onion Routing:** A system for anonymous and private internet connections based on mix networks, using layered encryption.
- **Crowds:** An anonymity system where users blend into a crowd, forwarding requests through a network of peers.
- **Freedom (http://www.freedom.net):** Provides an anonymous internet connection at the IP layer, supporting multiple protocols and allowing the creation of pseudonyms.

### 2.2 Author-Based Anonymity Tools

- **Janus (Rewebber, http://www.rewebber.de):** Combines connection and author-based anonymity, rewriting URLs to hide the true location of web pages.
- **Goldberg and Wagner’s Rewebber Network:** Uses a network of HTTP proxy servers to route requests through multiple layers of encryption, ensuring only the final server knows the true location of the content.
- **Eternity Service (Anderson):** A server-based storage medium resistant to denial of service attacks and destruction of participating file servers, allowing anonymous and persistent document storage.
- **Usenet Eternity:** A Usenet-based implementation of the Eternity Service, using specific formatting and encryption to store and retrieve anonymously published documents.

These tools and systems have laid the groundwork for the development of Publius, which aims to provide a robust, tamper-evident, and censorship-resistant web publishing platform.
