### 4. Methodology and Experiments

#### 4.1 Baseline Comparisons
We compare our proposed mechanisms with the Wrapped Laplace and Polar Laplace methods as baselines. The use of differential privacy in the local model is often challenging due to the excessive noise it introduces, making virtually all check-ins indistinguishable. This is particularly problematic for location data, where densely populated areas with numerous bars and restaurants can complicate the anonymization process. Ideally, we aim to reduce the protection guarantees to smaller distances, an advantage offered by metric privacy and its variants, such as directional privacy, which allow for relaxed privacy guarantees within a defined protection radius.

#### 4.2 Data Sanitization
We sanitize all check-ins at the top 1000 locations by perturbing check-in times on a periodic 24-hour scale with a protection radius of Δt ≡ 3 hours. We use the 2-dimensional Purkayastha and Wrapped Laplace mechanisms, applying temporal privacy levels ℓt ∈ [10^(-3), 10^2]. For corresponding check-in locations, we use a protection radius of Δs ≡ 10 meters, employing the 3-dimensional Purkayastha and Polar Laplace mechanisms with spatial privacy levels ℓs ∈ [10^(-2), 10^2]. Each setting is repeated 25 times to obtain stabilized results.

For each check-in, we use nearest neighbor search to assign the perturbed check-in coordinates to the nearest location. We then aggregate the perturbed check-in times at each location into a 24-hour busyness histogram. Similarly, we create daily histograms for each location based on the original, unperturbed data, which serve as references for computing error metrics for each anonymization run. As in previous experiments, we use the Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) to compare the mechanisms.

#### 4.3 Results
Figure 8 shows the EMD over varying temporal and spatial privacy levels ℓt and ℓs. The Purkayastha mechanism outperforms the baseline combination of Wrapped and Polar Laplace, especially for privacy levels 10^(-1) ≤ ℓt ≤ 1. The effect of ℓs is less pronounced, as increasing ℓs generally reduces the error for both mechanisms, but slightly faster for Purkayastha than for Laplace (see also Figure 12 for a complementary view showing the spatial and temporal privacy levels ℓt and ℓs in the abscissa and columns, respectively).

Figure 9 displays exemplary busyness histograms for four selected locations, where the check-in data have been sanitized with privacy levels ℓs = ℓt ≈ 0.316. As shown, the Purkayastha mechanism better preserves utility compared to the baseline mechanisms.

### 5. Related Work
Various differential privacy (DP) mechanisms have been proposed for specific types of data. In the context of location data, Andrés et al. [2] introduced the concept of geo-indistinguishability along with the suitable PL mechanism. However, their approach assumes a flat surface, limiting its applicability to smaller areas where a planar approximation is acceptable. While it is possible to wrap the PL mechanism around the sphere, our experiments in Section 4.3 show that directional mechanisms provide superior utility at the same privacy level when considering global locations.

Data collection in the local model can be traced back to Warner [43], who proposed a method for conducting surveys that allows respondents to maintain privacy by randomizing their responses. This method aims to eliminate evasive answer bias in cases where individuals may prefer not to reply or to give incorrect answers to sensitive questions. Erlingsson et al. [12] presented a modern variant called RAPPOR, which privately collects statistics by hashing each user’s sensitive value to a Bloom filter and then applying randomized response to each bit in the filter array. Their method is suitable for discrete values, as hashing slightly differing floating-point values would drastically change their hashes. Kim et al. [23] employed RAPPOR to collect indoor positioning data based on a finite set of preinstalled indoor beacons.

Hay et al. [16, 17] evaluated existing DP histogram mechanisms in the central model. Compared to our approach with local sanitization, central DP mechanisms typically offer higher utility but require a trusted data aggregator.

### 6. Conclusion
We have introduced a novel notion of directional privacy for directional data. To realize this notion, we suggested the VMF and Purkayastha mechanisms, which are based on spherical distributions and intrinsically suit directional data. We proved that these mechanisms conform to the notion of differential privacy and derived other statistical properties such as expected distances, related densities, and cumulative distribution functions. For the Purkayastha distribution, we proposed a novel sampling algorithm, as no prior method was available.

Our analyses and experiments on real data demonstrate the applicability and advantages of our mechanisms over standard privacy mechanisms adapted to directional data. Notably, the new directional mechanisms typically require fewer data to achieve a certain accuracy. For directional statistics, such as the circular mean, we demonstrated that the local model may achieve higher utility and is preferable over the central model, as it does not require a trusted aggregator. The facilitated use cases include important applications such as privately collecting mobility data in the local model, where the data collector cannot or may not be trusted by the users.

Future work could include finding other applications or domains for which specialized mechanisms yield improved privacy-utility trade-offs, as well as devising more efficient sampling routines, especially in high dimensions.

#### A.1 Special Functions and Notation
Directional distributions, as considered in Sections 2.2 and 3, often involve special functions and notation. These include the von Mises-Fisher (VMF) distribution, the Purkayastha distribution, and their respective cumulative distribution functions (CDFs). The VMF distribution is a probability distribution on the unit sphere, while the Purkayastha distribution is a rotationally symmetric directional distribution. The CDFs for these distributions are essential for understanding their statistical properties and for generating random samples.
