I have encountered some issues with Julia version 1.3 that I did not experience with version 1.2 on the same machine. It appears that an update to `libgit2` may have caused these problems. Below is the error message I received when attempting to update my packages:

```julia
(v1.3) pkg> up
  Updating registry at `~/.julia/registries/General`
  Updating git-repo `https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General.git`
┌ Warning: Some registries failed to update:

  Updating `/data/home/jfrigaa/.julia/environments/v1.3/Project.toml`
 [no changes]
  Updating `/data/home/jfrigaa/.julia/environments/v1.3/Manifest.toml`
```

This issue prevents me from downloading any new packages in version 1.3. Here are the details of my setup:

- **Julia Version:** 1.3.0-rc2.0 (Commit: a04936e3e0, 2019-09-12 19:49 UTC)
- **Operating System:** Linux (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)
- **CPU:** Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2683 v4 @ 2.10GHz
- **WORD_SIZE:** 64
- **LIBM:** libopenlibm
- **LLVM:** libLLVM-6.0.1 (ORCJIT, broadwell)
- **CentOS Version:** CentOS Linux release 7.5.1804 (Core)

Has anyone else experienced a similar problem? This issue is currently blocking my upgrade to Julia 1.3. Any assistance or insights would be greatly appreciated.
