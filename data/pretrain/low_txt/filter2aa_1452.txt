### Why a New Tool?
- **Evaluation of Existing Tools:**
  - Examined and evaluated existing tools for deciphering the Mach-O format.
  - Searched for working examples of security products capable of processing Mach-O malware.
  - Attempted to find a tool that could analyze Mach-O files regardless of the underlying architecture.
  - Researched better methods for visualizing the internal structure of Mach-O files.

- **Objective:**
  - To combine the best features of available tools and add a focus on network security.
  - To help network defenders better understand the Mach-O file format and provide an efficient method for analyzing binaries for malicious behavior.

### Mach-O Viz: Visual Representation of Mach-O Binaries
- **Key Features:**
  - Presents a Mach-O binary in a visual format, making it easier to understand the file's construction.
  - Provides a visual representation from the header through the load commands and into all corresponding segments.
  - Interactive, allowing users to zoom into segments for more detail.

---

### Additional Visualization Capabilities
- **File Format Visualization:**
  - Powerful back-end graph visualization and analytics system for disassembling the binary.
  - Currently supports i386, x86_64, and ARM6/7 architectures.
  - Accessible via any web browser, requiring no additional software.

---

### Design Features
- **Client Compatibility:**
  - Uses HTML5/JavaScript, increasing the range of devices that can utilize Mach-O Viz.
- **Back-End Integration:**
  - Relies on Apple’s updates of the Mach-O specification and tools like `otool` to keep Mach-O Viz up-to-date and relevant.
  - Utilizes the LLVM disassembler for accurate assembly code.
  - Incorporates open-source utilities to enhance functionality.

---

### File Structure Visualization
- **Top-Level Segments:**
  - Major segments are displayed at the top level.
  - Users can drill down by clicking on specific segments to view detailed information.
- **Load Commands:**
  - Specific values for the Mach-O file format are clearly displayed.

---

### Graph View
- **Interface:**
  - Offers an interface similar to IDA Pro.
  - Parses `otool` disassembly using Perl and converts it into Graphviz charts.
  - Displays the charts as SVGs within HTML, enhanced with JavaScript and CSS.

---

### Security Analysis
- **API and Function Detection:**
  - Identifies code segments using APIs and functions flagged as security risks.
- **Signature Generation:**
  - Automatically generates network and static file signatures for the binary.
  - Detects embedded network domains, IP addresses, URLs, and web protocols.
  - Calculates a unique binary signature using the Mach-O MAGIC value in the file’s header and a unique 16-byte string from the binary’s String Table.
- **Immediate Analysis:**
  - Results are directly linked to the code for instant analysis.
  - A file signature is generated for further use.
