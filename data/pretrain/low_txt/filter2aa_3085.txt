## Who Am I
- **Iftach Ian Amit** - Managing Partner, Security & Innovation
- This presentation will not be a continuation of last year's research.
- "Boss, is this supposed to be on the internet?" 
- "I think this is from my PowerPoint!"
- "We probably need to call someone..."
- "Finally declassified... (public domain)"

## The Initial Trace or Lo-Jack
- Refer to the "Rabbit Hole" talk from 2009 for more details.

## War vs. Crime
- **War**
  - Government/State
  - Official backing
  - Official resources
  - Financing
  - Expertise
  - Exploits/Vulnerabilities
- **Crime**
  - Private
  - Semi-official backing (organized crime)
  - Self-financing
  - Established expertise (in-house + outsourced)
  - Market for exploits

## CyberWar
- **Definition**: Cyberwarfare, also known as cyberwar and Cyber Warfare, is the use of computers and the Internet in conducting warfare in cyberspace. (Wikipedia)
- **Current Players**:
  - **USA**
    - USCC (United States Cyber Command)
    - NSA
    - Other TLA’s (Three Letter Agencies)

  - **Israel**
    - IDF (Israel Defense Forces) with added cyber-attack capabilities
    - C4I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence) branches in Intelligence and Air-Force commands
    - Mossad (check out the jobs section on mossad.gov.il)

## CyberWar - Attack
- Highly selective targeting of military and critical resources
- In conjunction with kinetic attacks
- Massive DDOS to “black-out” a region, disrupt services, and/or push political agendas (propaganda)

## CyberWar - Defense
- Never just military
- Targets include civilian infrastructure
- Physical and logical protections are crucial
- Availability and integrity of services
- Cost of making services unavailable for most civilians

## CyberCrime
- **Organizational Structure**:
  - Criminal Boss
  - Under Boss (Trojan Provider and Manager)
  - Trojan Command and Control
  - Campaign Managers
  - Attackers (Crimeware Toolkit Owners)
  - Trojan distribution in legitimate websites
  - Affiliation Networks
  - Stolen Data Resellers

## CyberCrime - Attack
- Channels: web, mail, open services
- Targeted attacks on premium resources
- Commissioned or for extortion purposes
- Carpet bombing for most attacks
- Segmenting geographical regions and market segments
- Secondary infections through controlled outposts
- Bots, infected sites

## CyberCrime - Locations
- Major cybercrime group locations

## CyberCrime - Ammunition
- Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)

## CyberCrime - Defense
- Anti-Virus, Anti-Malware, Anti-Spyware, Anti-Rootkit, Anti-Trojan
- Firewalls, IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems), IPS (Intrusion Prevention Systems)
- SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)

## Claim: CyberCrime is being used to conduct CyberWar
- **Proof**: Historical examples

### Estonia
- Civilian infrastructure targeted
- Attacks originated mostly from civilian networks

### Israel
- **Cast Lead, 2nd Lebanon War**
  - Palestinian TV hacked for propaganda
  - Attacks attributed to hacktivists
  - Mid-east crime-war links (ARHack)

### Georgia
- Highly synchronized kinetic and cyber attacks
- Targets mostly civilian
- Launched from civilian networks
- Russian crime/state dilemma (McColo, ESTDomains, Atrivo, RBN, RealHost, Micronnet, Eexhost)

### Iran
- **2009 Twitter DNS Hack**
  - Attributed to Iranian activity
  - Political connections (elections)
  - UN Council decisions
  - Protests by opposition in Tehran
  - "Iranian Cyber Army" and "Ashiyane" (Shiite group) connections

### China
- **Great Firewall of China**
  - Proving grounds for many cyber-attackers
  - Bulletproof hosting
- **Google and Adobe Hacks (January 2010)**
  - Sophisticated and targeted attacks
  - Zero-day exploit in Internet Explorer
  - Over 40 additional companies affected
  - Use of criminal groups for deniability

## The Future
- Formal training on cybersecurity by nations
- Commercial development of malware
- Information sharing between state and crime
- Lack of legislation and cooperation on a multinational level creates safe havens for cybercrime
- Treaties and anti-crime activities may be beneficial

## Summary
- Good: Formal training and information sharing
- Bad: Commercial development of malware
- Ugly: Money changes hands, less tracks to cover, criminal operations creating weapons
