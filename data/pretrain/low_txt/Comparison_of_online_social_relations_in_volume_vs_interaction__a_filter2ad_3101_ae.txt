### Summary of Inter-Message Time Distribution

The distribution of inter-message times can be divided into three distinct regions. For very short time intervals, the inter-message time is unusually brief, suggesting the presence of spam and providing an estimate of its proportion. This distribution aligns with other known task distributions, such as those observed in MSN Messenger. For inter-message times between 36 minutes and 1 day, the behavior closely resembles that of email transmissions, albeit at a lower rate. Beyond 1 day, we observe a daily synchronization of activity, but the overall distribution decays rapidly.

### Related Work

Social network analysis has traditionally been the domain of sociologists and anthropologists [43]. However, the availability of large-scale electronic social network data has opened new avenues for researchers in fields such as physics and computer science. Before the advent of large-scale online social networking platforms, various other online social networks have been studied. Email networks, for instance, are among the most extensively analyzed [14, 25, 41, 42]. Valverde and Solé have examined the social networks within open-source communities [41, 42], while recent studies have analyzed massive mobile communication data [34, 35]. These studies, using mobile phone records from millions of users, have revealed that the stability of communication networks largely depends on weak ties.

Holme et al. conducted a detailed analysis of an online dating community [23], where they observed the saturation of degree and power-law activity patterns over time. Mislove et al. investigated not only online social networks but also other web services with social networking features [30]. Java et al. focused on microblogs, analyzing the in-degree and out-degree distributions and user activity patterns [24]. Leskovec et al. analyzed the largest published instant messaging network, examining aspects such as the number of buddies, conversation duration, and geographic usage patterns [27].

Adamic et al. performed motif analysis on Yahoo! Answers, finding that the feed-forward loop (motif 7 in Figure 13) is particularly abundant in the "Programming" category [1]. This abundance is argued to be a unique characteristic of knowledge communities, where experts assist those with less expertise. Milo et al. also reported that transitive interactions and triads are more common than intransitive ones [28].

Online friendships differ from offline ones. Cummings et al. compared the quality of different means of social interaction, concluding that online relationships are generally considered less valuable than offline ones [10]. It is widely acknowledged that online relationships tend to be more superficial and easier to form [2].

### Conclusions

In this study, we analyzed the guestbook logs of Cyworld, the largest online social network in Korea. We constructed a weighted and directed activity network based on user comments in other guestbooks. The Cyworld activity network experienced explosive growth in 2004, and our dataset covers the period from July 2003 to October 2005, encompassing the peak growth phase. Two limitations of our dataset include self-posts and likely spams. Self-posts, which are likely responses to previous posts, could not be disambiguated according to the intended recipient. Additionally, although automated scripts are banned, our logs contain comments generated by such scripts, which we suspect are primarily spam.

We analyzed the structural characteristics of the activity network and compared them with the friends network. Despite being weighted and directed, the activity network's structure is similar to the friend relationship network. The in-degree and out-degree distributions are close, and social interactions through the guestbook are highly reciprocal. When considering only reciprocated links in the activity network, the degree correlation distribution shows more pronounced assortativity, placing it closer to known social networks. The k-core analysis further supports this, indicating that the friends network deviates from typical social networks and has an unusually large number of highly connected cores.

The weighted and directed nature of the activity network provides insights into the actual dynamics of user interactions. Our analysis shows that users are reciprocated for their activity in terms of the total number of messages, and clear reciprocity exists between most pairs of users. However, disparity analysis reveals that users with around two hundred friends or fewer tend to communicate unevenly, while those with a large number of friends interact more evenly. Network motif analysis of the activity network demonstrates that online interactions through the Cyworld guestbook follow trends observed in other social networks [29]. However, massive one-way communication, suspected to be from spammers and celebrities, distorts the Z-scores for motifs 1 and 2. Despite the rapid growth during the study period, the Z-score distributions of network motifs consistently show high proximity to those from previously analyzed social networks.

We observed that the activity measured by node strength increases linearly with the number of friends but starts to decline beyond 200. This number is higher than expected based on Dunbar's number and warrants further investigation. We also found that the distribution of inter-message time intervals has three distinct regions, but a comprehensive understanding of this tri-modal behavior remains elusive, highlighting another area for future research.

Online social networks are rapidly expanding and influencing many aspects of our daily web experience. This work offers insights into the macroscopic behavior of an online social network. We plan to extend this research to include an analysis of group dynamics and microscopic analyses from individual user perspectives. We hope this work provides valuable insights into information flow in cyberspace.
