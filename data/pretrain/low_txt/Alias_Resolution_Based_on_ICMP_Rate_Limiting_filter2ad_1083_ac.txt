### Data Collection and Preprocessing

We analyzed 44 files, each corresponding to a single Juniper router. These files contained information on 985 IPv4 and 803 IPv6 addresses/interfaces. After removing 436 unresponsive IPv4 addresses and 435 unresponsive IPv6 addresses (which did not respond to probes sent by Midar, Speedtrap, or Limited Ltd), the resulting dataset consisted of 6,577 IPv4 and 2,556 IPv6 alias pairs.

For the Switch network, we obtained a single file on May 3, 2019, with measurements conducted from May 3 to May 5, 2019. This file identified 173 Cisco routers running either IOS or IOS-XR. From the 1,073 IPv4 and 706 IPv6 addresses listed in the file, we removed 121 unresponsive IPv4 addresses and 29 unresponsive IPv6 addresses. The resulting dataset for the Switch network consisted of 4,912 IPv4 and 2,641 IPv6 alias pairs.

### Reducing False Positives

To reduce false positives, we computed the distribution of the number of rounds required for the `refine()` function to finalize the alias set for each seed in our dataset. For 79% (98%) of all seeds, `refine()` took 2 (3) more rounds. It is important to note that a minimum of two rounds is required by design (Sect. 3.4). This implies that `refine()` only changed the alias set for 20% of the seeds in a single round.

### Results

Table 5 presents the precision and recall of Midar, Speedtrap, Limited Ltd., and the union of both tools on IPv4 and IPv6 ground truth data from the Internet2 and Switch networks. Note that the recall from the union of both tools can be greater than the sum of the recall values for individual tools, as observed in the Switch results. This is due to the transitive closure of alias sets identified from the two tools, which leads to the detection of additional alias pairs. The main findings from Table 5 are as follows:

1. **High Precision of Limited Ltd.**: Limited Ltd. exhibits high precision in identifying both IPv4 and IPv6 alias pairs from both networks with zero false positives.
2. **IPv6 Alias Discovery**: Limited Ltd. can effectively discover IPv6 aliases that state-of-the-art Speedtrap is unable to find. In the Internet2 network, which uses Juniper routers, Limited Ltd. identified 68.4% of the IPv6 alias pairs, while Speedtrap was unable to identify any. In the Switch network, which deploys Cisco routers, Limited Ltd. and Speedtrap showed comparable performance, identifying 38.5% and 38.4% of the IPv6 alias pairs, respectively. Together, the two tools identified 77.2% of the IPv6 alias pairs, a small boost beyond the simple addition of their individual results, due to the transitive closure of the alias sets found by each tool.
3. **IPv4 Alias Discovery**: Limited Ltd. can discover IPv4 aliases that state-of-the-art Midar is unable to find. In the Internet2 network, Limited Ltd. identified 80.0% of the aliases, while Midar detected 67.3%. In the Switch network, Limited Ltd. identified 49.9% of the aliases, while Midar detected only 9.0%.

### Detailed Observations

We conducted follow-up analysis on the behavior of Speedtrap and Midar to ensure proper assessment of these tools. First, we examined Speedtrap’s logs to diagnose its inability to detect any IPv6 aliases for Internet2. We found that every fragmentation identifier time series that Speedtrap sought to use as a signature was either labeled as random or unresponsive. This was not surprising, as prior work on Speedtrap [29] also reported that this technique does not apply to Juniper routers, which primarily comprise the Internet2 network. Second, we explored Midar’s logs to investigate the cause of its low recall for the Switch network. We learned that only one-third of the IPv4 addresses in this network have monotonically increasing IP IDs.

### Limitations and Future Work

Because ICMP rate limiting can be triggered at thousands of packets per second, Limited Ltd. requires sending many more packets than other state-of-the-art alias resolution techniques. The maximum observed probing rate during our experiments was 34,000 pps from a single vantage point during a 5-second round. On Internet2 (Switch), Midar and Speedtrap sent 164.5k (106k) and 4k (12.7k) probe packets, while Limited Ltd. sent about 4.8M (12.7M) packets. In future work, we plan to explore ways to reduce the overhead of probing and make Limited Ltd. more scalable.

### Ethical Considerations

Limited Ltd. works by triggering limits in routers that are there for protective reasons, raising ethical concerns. To evaluate the impact of Limited Ltd., we took two steps: experiments in a lab environment (Sect. 5.1 and Appendix A) and feedback from operators (Sect. 5.2).

#### 5.1 Lab Experiments

We ran experiments in a lab environment on conservatively chosen hardware (over 10 years old) to show that Limited Ltd. has a controlled impact. Our findings are:
1. Routers being probed with Echo Requests by the tool remain reachable to others via ping with a high probability.
2. Router CPUs show a manageable overhead at the highest probing rate, leading us to believe that our measurements are unlikely to impact the control and data planes.
3. Both Limited Ltd. and existing measurement techniques impact troubleshooting efforts (e.g., ping, traceroute). Limited Ltd. does not stand out in terms of impact compared with other accepted techniques. Appendix A details the experiments supporting these conclusions.

#### 5.2 Real-World Operator Feedback

In addition to lab experiments, we conducted joint experiments with SURFnet and Switch to evaluate the potential impact of Limited Ltd. The experiment involved running Limited Ltd. on their routers while they monitored CPU usage. Each run lasted about 1 minute. For SURFnet, we ran Limited Ltd. on two Juniper routers: an MX240 and an MX204. The operator observed a 4% and 2% CPU overhead, respectively. The CPU overhead was observed on the MPC (line modules) CPU and not the central routing engine CPU. For Switch, we ran Limited Ltd. on three Cisco routers: an NCS 55A1, an ASR 9001, and an ASR-920-24SZ-M. On the first two routers, the operator noted no observable change in CPU utilization. On the third router, which has a lower CPU capacity, the operator observed a CPU overhead up to 29%. These results confirm our belief that Limited Ltd. is unlikely to impact the control and data planes.

### Conclusion

This paper presents Limited Ltd., a new, high-precision alias resolution technique for both IPv4 and IPv6 networks that leverages the ICMP rate limiting feature of individual routers. We have shown that ICMP rate limiting can generate loss traces that can be used to reliably identify aliases from other interfaces. Limited Ltd. enables IPv6 alias resolution on networks composed of Juniper routers, which the state-of-the-art Speedtrap technique cannot identify. As part of our future work, we plan to enhance the efficiency of Limited Ltd. and explore the use of ICMP rate limiting for fingerprinting individual routers. Both the source code for Limited Ltd. and our dataset are publicly available [4].
