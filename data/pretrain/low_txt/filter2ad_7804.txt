## ABSTRACT
This paper outlines a tutorial on large-scale DNS data analysis. The tutorial is designed as a practical course for academics and researchers focusing on DNS security. It covers data collection, analysis, and various techniques, demonstrating and extending tools used by security researchers to process and analyze tera-scale DNS archives.

Experimentation, Measurement, Performance, Security

### Keywords
DNS Security, Large-scale Data Analysis

## 1. INTRODUCTION
DNS data is increasingly important in security analysis, intrusion detection, and research. Even small DNS collection systems can generate vast amounts of traffic, necessitating tera-scale storage. Consequently, researchers often need to develop real-time, in-line analysis tools to handle this volume of data.

This tutorial will provide practical examples, demonstrations, and advice on large-scale DNS data analysis in enterprise-level network measurement, security analysis, and threat identification. The focus will be on creating and modifying tools (e.g., reusable frameworks for real-time analysis) rather than specific research topics (e.g., machine learning, botnet remediation, etc.).

## 2. OVERVIEW
Participants should have strong skills in C and Python programming, familiarity with large-scale 'NoSQL' storage systems, and some knowledge of DNS resolver configuration (e.g., BIND, Unbound). For parts of the tutorial, participants will interact with local systems deployed on a LAN and should bring a suitable notebook or system. Depending on external network conditions, experiments will be conducted on existing DNS information sharing systems like SIE. Participants will be provided with a virtual machine image to simplify network access and speed up development exercises. The tutorial is designed for FreeBSD and Debian systems, but participants are free to use their own development environment.

### Components of the Tutorial
- **Fundamentals**: A brief overview of the Domain Name System, key RFCs, and research-oriented information exchanges. Topics include stub-layer DNS properties, application-based DNS stub behavior, recursive fingerprinting, cache poisoning, forgery resistance techniques, DNSSEC, and authority-level zone analysis.
- **Policy**: Discussion on human subjects requirements, user privacy, and license agreements for accessing individual zones, IANA and RIR databases, and PII in DNS. Focus will also be on RFC 1262 and notification/opt-out requirements for Internet-scale DNS measurement projects.
- **Passive DNS**: Extension of existing tools for building and utilizing passive DNS databases. Examples include constructing graphs of malicious domain networks, time series analysis, zone enumeration, and flux network detection.
- **Authority DNS Analysis**: Use and extension of existing DNS analysis tools (e.g., pcaputils, dnscap, dnspython, scapy, nmsg-based tools) to analyze authority DNS logs from botnet C&C servers. This will help identify recursive farms, closed recursive networks, configuration errors, and general 'DNS radiation' on the Internet. Participants will also analyze TLD zones to identify spam networks.
- **Large-scale DNS Measurement**: Building and executing an Internet-scale DNS measurement system to identify recursive, authoritative, and secondary servers, fingerprint resolvers, and find DNS path options. Using the completed passive DNS exercise, participants will identify zone cuts and map policy hierarchies within networks.

In summary, this tutorial is a practical, tool-oriented guide for researchers interested in working with large-scale DNS data. While the motivating examples focus on DNS abuse, security, and botnets, the tools and techniques are generally applicable for surveys, measurements, and other tasks involving tera-scale DNS data.
