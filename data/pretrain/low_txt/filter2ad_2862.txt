**Abstract:**

Unattended sensor networks operating in hostile environments are often tasked with collecting data that may be of high value to an adversary. The inability of these sensors to offload sensitive data in real-time to a secure external entity makes them particularly vulnerable to focused attacks aimed at eliminating or modifying critical information.

To enhance data survival, the sensors must collectively employ strategies to confuse the adversary by altering the location and representation of the data. However, this is challenging in unattended networks where the adversary, even if limited in the scale or scope of simultaneous compromises, can move freely among the sensors and compromise them at will.

A similar "mobile adversary" model is well-known in cryptography, leading to the development of proactive cryptography. Despite its relevance, this model has not been widely adopted by the security research community. This talk will explore various aspects of the mobile adversary in the context of unattended sensor networks, discuss viable and simple countermeasures (with varying degrees of effectiveness), and outline open problems and challenges in this area.
