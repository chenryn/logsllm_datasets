### Abstract

While many hackers are familiar with using Nmap for basic port scanning and OS detection, the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) elevates these capabilities to a new level. Nmap's high-speed networking engine can now perform tasks such as web site spidering for SQL injection vulnerabilities, brute-forcing MSRPC services, identifying open proxies, and more. Nmap comes equipped with over 125 NSE scripts designed for network discovery, vulnerability detection, exploitation, and authentication cracking.

Instead of providing a general overview, Fyodor and Nmap co-maintainer David Fifield will demonstrate practical solutions to common problems. With extensive experience in scanning millions of hosts, they will share insights into vulnerabilities found on enterprise networks and how Nmap can be used to quickly detect these issues. They will also show how easy it is to write custom NSE scripts tailored to specific network needs. Additionally, they will provide a glimpse into recent Nmap developments and upcoming features. This presentation is accessible to those with no prior NSE experience, but reading the Nmap documentation at [http://nmap.org/book/nse.html](http://nmap.org/book/nse.html) is recommended for a deeper understanding.

### Resources

These slides are a preview. The final version will be available by August 1, 2010, at [http://insecure.org/presentations/BHDC10/](http://insecure.org/presentations/BHDC10/). Our goal is to make this presentation useful, informative, and engaging, even for those with limited knowledge of Nmap and the Nmap Scripting Engine. To get the most out of this presentation, we recommend reading about and trying Nmap at [http://nmap.org](http://nmap.org) and the Nmap Scripting Engine at [http://nmap.org/book/nse.html](http://nmap.org/book/nse.html).
