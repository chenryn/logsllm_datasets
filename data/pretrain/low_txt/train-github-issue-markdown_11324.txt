### How to Add "Open Windows Terminal Here" to the Right-Click Context Menu in Windows 10

In Windows 7, when you press `Shift` and right-click in a folder without selecting any files, you can see the option "Open command window here."

In Windows 10, the default behavior is to show "Open PowerShell window here" when you perform the same action.

For Windows 10 (version 1903 and later), how can we add the following three options to the right-click context menu?
- Open Command Prompt here
- Open PowerShell window here
- Open Windows Terminal here

Thank you for your assistance.
