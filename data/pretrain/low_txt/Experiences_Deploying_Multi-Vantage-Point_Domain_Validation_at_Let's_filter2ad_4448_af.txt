### Multi-Vantage-Point Domain Validation: A Comprehensive Overview

**Introduction to Previous Work and Context**

Brandt et al. [23] explored the use of multiple vantage points for validating keys in Trust On First Use (TOFU) applications, while Wendlandt et al. [55] investigated the use of multi-path probing to enhance SSH-style host authentication. Concurrently, CloudFlare released an experimental API for domain validation using multiple vantage points [33]. To our knowledge, this API is not in use by any Certificate Authority (CA), and our work is the first to demonstrate the feasibility of multi-vantage-point domain validation at Internet scale, with the successful issuance of over half a billion TLS certificates.

Another line of research has focused on transparency frameworks like Certificate Transparency [35], which aim to provide global visibility into TLS certificates issued by CAs. While Certificate Transparency logs allow domain owners to detect fraudulent TLS certificates, user communications remain vulnerable until these certificates are revoked, a process that is error-prone. In contrast, our approach of multi-vantage-point validation aims to prevent the issuance of bogus certificates.

### Conclusion

We have explored the design space of multi-vantage-point domain validation and demonstrated the feasibility of balancing multiple objectives such as security, manageability, performance, and resilience to benign failures. Our deployment at Let's Encrypt, which has secured the issuance of over half a billion TLS certificates, underscores the viability of multi-vantage-point domain validation at Internet scale. We make the following concluding recommendations:

1. **Testing MultiVA Deployments**: As other CAs start to adopt this technology, we recommend using our evaluation methodology, such as our open-source BGP simulation framework, to guide the selection of sufficiently diverse vantage points and validate the overall deployment.
2. **Industry-Wide Adoption**: All certificate authorities should consider adopting multi-vantage-point domain validation to secure TLS certificate issuance. We plan to engage with more CAs to discuss potential deployments.

### Appendix

#### A.1 Details of API Calls in MultiVA

MultiVA is implemented in the source code of the Validation Authority (VA) module (see [6]) in Boulder and does not require any changes to other modules, such as the Registration Authority that handles interactions with customers or the Web Front End that serves the publicly-accessible API endpoints. All API calls between different components, including both co-located components in the same data center and remote components like the remote VAs, go through gRPC, which offers confidentiality and integrity via mutually-authenticated TLS streams, as well as load balancing through DNS-based component discovery.

The MultiVA process is initiated when the Registration Authority (RA) requests validation and calls the `PerformValidation` method at the VA (via gRPC). This method takes the domain being validated and the challenge information as arguments and returns whether the validation is successful. The primary VA then asynchronously calls the same `PerformValidation` method at all remote VAs and begins its own validation. After the primary validation completes successfully, the primary VA counts the number of successful remote validations and blocks until either quorum is reached or enough errors occur such that quorum cannot be achieved. Depending on the results and the quorum policy, the primary VA returns the validation result to the RA.

By using this model, only the VA needs to be changed, and the existing gRPC layer can be easily extended to allow for secure communication with the remote VAs.
