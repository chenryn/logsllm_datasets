### Key Price and Attack Impact

The plot in Figure 13 illustrates that the effect of prediction errors in the attack is not significant. This figure shows the total daily economic damage that a nation-state attacker can impose on the demand side of the studied markets, as a function of the number of compromised high-wattage IoT devices.

**Figure 13: Total Daily Economic Damage Imposed by the Nation-State Attacker on the Demand Side of the Studied Markets Versus the Number of Compromised High-Wattage IoT Devices.**

The attacker can also target players on the generation side of the market. To evaluate this, we used the optimization model with the objective function given in (23). Figure 14 presents the total daily economic damage to generation companies in each of the studied markets, based on the number of compromised IoT devices controlled by the attacker. With only 200,000 compromised IoT devices, the attacker can cause $2.8 million and $2.9 million in economic damage to generation companies in the California and New York ISOs, respectively. Assuming the attacker launches the MaMIoT attack 100 days per year, the total annual economic damage would be $280 million and $290 million in the California and New York markets, respectively. The attacker can inflict more damage in the California market than in the New York market once the botnet size exceeds 220,000 compromised devices. Even with a small number of compromised IoT bots, such as 10,000 bots (each with an average power consumption of 3 kW), the annual economic damage to generation companies would be $1.75 million and $2.5 million in the California and New York markets, respectively. It is important to note that the System Operator (SO) cannot detect the attack in any of the simulated scenarios, as the system load profile closely resembles typical real-time system demand. For further detailed analysis on the stealthiness of the MaMIoT attack in the generation side companies of the studied markets, interested readers can refer to Appendix IV.1.

### Countermeasures

While there is currently no single effective countermeasure to prevent the MaMIoT attack, a combination of the following strategies could be employed to mitigate its damaging consequences.

#### Reducing the Effect and Possibility of Nation-State Attacks

Section 5 highlights that the economic consequences from attacks by class II attackers are much more detrimental than those by class I attackers. Class II attackers are more likely to occur in real-world scenarios due to the reduced concern for negative legal repercussions, such as prosecution. Therefore, reducing the effect and possibility of nation-state attackers is a top priority in determining countermeasures.

Publicly available historical market data is a significant factor in enabling the MaMIoT attack. To eliminate the risk of nation-state attackers, Independent System Operators (ISOs) should release detailed market data only to market players. This new data privacy plan would add the first barrier for nation-state attackers to access recent historical market data, which is necessary for estimating price sensitivity and other crucial parameters required to launch a successful stealth attack. Without this information, the economic consequence of an undetectable attack is limited, and an intelligent attacker would be forced to launch a conservative attack to maintain stealth, causing minimal demand changes.

**Figures 15 and 16: Total Daily Economic Damage of the Nation-State Adversary in the Simulated Markets Versus the Estimation Error in the Stealth and Price-Load Sensitivity Parameters.**

These figures show the daily economic damage of the type II attacker on both simulated markets, relative to the estimation error in the stealth and price-load sensitivity parameters. As the estimation error increases, the influence of the attack declines significantly (approximately 50% decline with a 25% estimation error). These results verify the partial effectiveness of the data privacy countermeasure discussed above.

#### Practical Data Privacy Solutions

While tightening access to historical market data can thwart many attackers, it may also prevent researchers and market analysts from performing analyses on these markets. A more practical solution would be to release redacted or altered versions of the market data or delay the release of full datasets, making them unusable in real-time. This strategy would make it very difficult for the attacker to estimate the crucial parameters of the optimization models reliably. Our analysis shows that releasing downsampled (e.g., every 2 hours instead of every 5 minutes) and delayed (e.g., one month) versions of the market data can decrease the attack's economic damage by up to 87%.

#### Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM)

The most effective and practical countermeasure against MaMIoT attacks is to develop and install non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) or non-intrusive appliance load monitoring (NIALM) algorithms on electricity meters in homes within the power grid. NILM and NIALM analyze the voltage and current going into a house through the electricity meters to deduce what appliances are used at which times and their individual energy consumption. These algorithms have traditionally been developed to help homeowners and utility companies optimize energy usage and minimize monthly electricity bills. With recent advancements in machine learning, especially deep learning, reliable NILM algorithms can be developed to quickly detect MaMIoT attacks and inform homeowners and utility companies of suspicious activities. For example, NILM can easily reveal the suspicious use of an electric oven in the morning when the homeowner is at work and flag it as an anomaly in the meter’s data. Further detailed analysis is needed to design and tune reliable and state-of-the-art NILM algorithms for practical use. A sample data of a residential customer that can be used in NILM attack detection is shown in Figure 17 [33].

**Figure 17: Sample Data of a Residential Customer for NILM Attack Detection [33].**

To address privacy concerns, the developed machine learning models can learn about energy usage patterns without specific references to the devices used in the house. In such cases, the issued alert by the trained model will inform the homeowner of unauthorized device use without pinpointing a specific device.

### Conclusions

In this paper, we introduced MaMIoT, the first energy market manipulation cyberattack where an adversary can slightly alter the power system's real-time demand through a botnet of high-wattage IoT devices to gain additional profit from the electricity market or cause major economic damage to market players. We evaluated the attack models using real datasets from the California and New York electricity markets. The simulation results revealed that with only 200,000 bots in a botnet, the attacker can cause $2.8 million and $3.8 million worth of economic damage to the demand and generation side players of the California and New York markets, respectively. We also showed that the MaMIoT attack can help a typical power plant owner gain an additional 30% in profit from the energy market while maintaining attack stealth for increased repeatability.

We hope this paper raises awareness of the significance of MaMIoT attacks to market operators, ISOs, IoT manufacturers, and system security experts, leading to more secure electricity markets. As the number of smart appliances with internet connectivity continues to grow, this problem will become even more critical in the near future.
