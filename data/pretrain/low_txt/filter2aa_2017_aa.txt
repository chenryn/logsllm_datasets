### Introduction to ICS
#### Where do we find Industrial Control Systems (ICS)?
- Manufacturing plants
- Food processing
- Power plants
- Building automation systems (AC, HVAC, etc.)
- Water treatment
- Pharmaceutical manufacturing
- Chemical plants
- Other applications: swimming pools, building heating systems, dams, etc.

#### What is an ICS?
- **Corporate IT Network:**
  - ERP servers
  - Data Historian/SCADA servers
  - Maintenance laptops
  - Supervision consoles
- **Supervision Network/SCADA:**
  - PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers)
  - RTUs (Remote Terminal Units)
  - Production network
- **ICS Components:**
  - Sensors and actuators
  - Local HMI (Human-Machine Interface)
  - Supervision screens
  - Data historian
  - Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs)

#### ICS vs. Corporate IT
- **Corporate IT:**
  - Handles data
  - Focus on confidentiality and integrity
- **ICS:**
  - Interfaces with the physical world (cyber-physical systems)
  - Focus on availability and safety

#### IoT and Smart Devices
- Not within the scope of this training
- Fit the definition of "cyber-physical" systems
  - Examples: cardio-meter for smartphones, smart electrical plugs

### Evolution of ICS
- **Historical Timeline:**
  - 1700s: Industrial Revolution
  - 1900s: Use of relays for remote control
  - 1950s: Punch paper tape for machine control
  - 1960s: Distributed control systems
  - 1969: First PLCs
  - 1973: Invention of Modbus
  - 1986: PLCs controlled by PCs
  - 1992: TCP/IP for PLCs
  - 2003: Web servers for PLCs
  - ~2010s: Integration with Active Directory

### Future of ICS
- More use of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products
- Active Directory domains
- Soft-PLCs (e.g., CodeSYS under Windows computers)

### Vocabulary
- **ICS (Industrial Control System)**
- **IACS (Industrial Automation and Control Systems)**
- **SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition)**
- **DCS (Distributed Control System)**

### SCADA vs. DCS
- **SCADA:**
  - Event/data acquisition driven
  - Used across multiple sites
  - Can work offline
  - Low response time
- **DCS:**
  - Process driven
  - Limited to local process monitoring
  - Works as a standalone system
  - Dedicated products for specific industries

### ICS Components
- **Sensors and Actuators:**
  - Interact with the physical world (e.g., pressure sensors, valves, motors)
- **Local HMI:**
  - Human-Machine Interface for subprocess supervision
- **PLC:**
  - Programmable Logic Controller managing sensors and actuators
- **Supervision Screen:**
  - Remote supervision of industrial processes
- **Data Historian:**
  - Records production and SCADA network data
- **RTU:**
  - Remote Terminal Unit (standalone PLC)
- **IED:**
  - Intelligent Electronic Device (smart sensor)

### CIM Pyramid
- **Level 3:**
  - Orders and stock management, clients, and accounting (ERP)
- **Level 2:**
  - Management of products (storage, moving, etc.)
- **Level 1:**
  - Automation
- **Level 0:**
  - Sensors and actuators

### Industrial Protocols
- **Common Protocols:**
  - HART/Wireless HART
  - Profibus
  - Modbus
  - Profinet/S7
  - DNP3
- **Field Protocols:**
  - Used by PLCs and intelligent sensors/actuators
- **OPC:**
  - For data exchange with corporate networks and Windows-based systems

### ICS Vendors
- **Major Vendors:**
  - Siemens (362,000 employees)
  - ABB (150,000 employees)
  - Emerson (115,000 employees)
  - Rockwell (22,500 employees)
  - Schneider Electric (152,000 employees)

### IT vs. OT
- **IT:**
  - Focus on confidentiality and integrity
  - Regular security patches and antivirus
  - Centralized system administration
  - Nominative accounts and IAM
- **OT:**
  - Focus on availability and safety
  - Security patches applied infrequently
  - Antivirus usage varies
  - Lack of centralized system administration
  - Generic, shared accounts
  - Real-time operations, downtime is costly

### ICS Security Awareness
- **Timeline:**
  - Pre-2011: Limited awareness
  - 2011: Stuxnet incident
  - Post-2011: Growing awareness
- **Drivers:**
  - Government regulations
  - Company policies
  - Fear of cyber threats

### Vendor Cyber-Security Offerings
- Most ICS vendors now offer dedicated security products and services
- However, vendor staff may lack the necessary knowledge and training

### Quiz
1. **What is the difference between a PLC and an RTU?**
2. **Name three major ICS vendors.**
3. **What is OPC used for?**
4. **What is the mean response time for a PLC?**
5. **Why do people use PLCs instead of standard PCs?**

### Module 2: What is Wrong with Current ICS Security?
- **Network Segmentation:**
  - Often poorly implemented
  - No true air-gapping
  - Misconfigured ACLs on routers
  - Wide access to ICS from the corporate network
- **Security Supervision:**
  - Lack of central oversight
- **Organization and Awareness:**
  - Low maturity in ICS security
  - No clear responsibility for ICS security
  - Misconceptions about security
- **Vulnerability Management:**
  - Infrequent patching
- **Third-Party Management:**
  - Poorly managed third-party access
- **Security in Protocols:**
  - Many protocols lack built-in security

### Reconnaissance: Exposure
- **Shodan:**
  - Search engine for finding devices exposed to the Internet
  - Scans the entire IPv4 range
  - Provides information on exposed technologies
- **Alternatives:**
  - Zmap
  - Masscan
  - Other online services and surveys

### Conclusion
- ICS security is a growing concern
- Awareness and implementation are improving but still have a long way to go
