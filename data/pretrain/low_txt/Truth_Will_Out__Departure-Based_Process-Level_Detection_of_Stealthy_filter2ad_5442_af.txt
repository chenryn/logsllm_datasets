### Complementing, Not Competing: Our Approach

To our knowledge, the only method in the related literature that exclusively monitors raw sensor measurements to detect attacks on control systems, based on learned historical system dynamics, is the AR (AutoRegressive) method used in [22]. In §4.4, we provided a comparative analysis with this method and demonstrated that our approach, known as PASAD, yielded superior results. Specifically, our method exhibits less sensitivity to noise, thereby enabling the detection of covert attacks in sensor signals that are undetectable by the AR method.

### Conclusion

Ensuring the security of cyber-physical systems (CPS) requires a comprehensive consideration of all operational aspects. The fundamental difference between CPS and traditional IT systems lies in their interaction with the physical world, which exposes them to attacks aimed at causing tangible impacts on the underlying physical processes. Recognizing the importance of implementing intrusion detection capabilities at the process level as an advanced line of defense, we introduced a novel, specification-agnostic technique capable of detecting stealthy attacks by monitoring time series of sensor measurements for structural changes in their behavior. We validated our approach through extensive testing on new, carefully crafted attacks in a simulation setting using the popular Tennessee Eastman (TE) model, a dataset generated by a physical industrial control system (ICS) testbed, and real ICS data.

### Appendices

#### A: Proof that ||UT Px|| = ||Px||

Therefore, \( R(U) = R(UU^T) = R(P) \).

#### C: Proof that \( \tilde{U} : R(U) \rightarrow R(U^T) \) is an Isometric Isomorphism

Since \( U^T P = U^T \) from (11), and \( P = UU^T \) from (1), what remains to show is that
\[ ||U^T x|| = ||UU^T x||. \]

Let \( x \) be any vector in \( \mathbb{R}^L \). Noting that the square Euclidean norm is equal to the dot product of a vector with itself, we write
\[ ||UU^T x||^2 = UU^T x \cdot UU^T x \]
\[ = (UU^T x)^T (UU^T x) \]
\[ = x^T U (U^T U) U^T x \]
\[ = x^T UU^T x \]
\[ = (Ux)^T (Ux) = ||U^T x||^2. \]

Therefore, \( ||UU^T x|| = ||U^T x|| \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{R}^L \).

#### B: Proof that \( R(U) = R(P) \)

First, note that since all columns of \( U \) are linearly independent, \( K(U) = \{0\} \), which means that for all \( y \in K(U) \),
\[ Uy = 0 \implies y = 0. \]

We also have \( K(P) = K(UU^T) = K(U^T) \) since
\[ x \in K(UU^T) \implies UU^T x = 0 \]
\[ \implies U^T x = 0 \]
\[ \implies x \in K(U^T). \]

Finally,
\[ x \in R(UU^T) \implies x \perp K(UU^T) \]
\[ \implies x \perp K(U^T) \]
\[ \implies x \in R(U). \]

Recall that \( \tilde{U} \) is the restriction of \( U^T \) to the orthogonal complement of its kernel \( K(U^T)^\perp = R(U) \); i.e., \( \tilde{U} = U^T|_{R(U)} \). Since \( \tilde{U} : R(U) \rightarrow R(U^T) \) is a linear map, by definition it satisfies the following two conditions:
\[ \tilde{U}(v + v') = \tilde{U}(v) + \tilde{U}(v') \]
\[ \tilde{U}(cv) = c \tilde{U}(v) \]
for all \( v, v' \in R(U) \) and \( c \in \mathbb{R} \).

Hence, \( \tilde{U} \) is a homomorphism. For \( \tilde{U} \) to be an isomorphism, it must further be bijective, i.e., both injective and surjective.

To show that \( \tilde{U} \) is injective (one-to-one), let \( v, v' \in R(U) \) have the same image \( w \in R(U^T) \), then it must be that \( v = v' \).

Since \( w \in R(U^T) \) is the image of both \( v \) and \( v' \), we have
\[ w = \tilde{U}v = \tilde{U}v' \]
\[ \implies \tilde{U}v - \tilde{U}v' = 0 \]
\[ \implies U^T v - U^T v' = 0 \]
\[ \implies U^T (v - v') = 0 \]
\[ \implies v - v' \in K(U^T). \]

But \( v - v' \in R(U) \), hence \( v - v' \in R(U) \cap K(U^T) \Rightarrow v - v' \in R(U) \cap R(U)^\perp = \{0\} \Rightarrow v - v' = 0 \). Thus, \( v = v' \).

To see that \( \tilde{U} \) is surjective, note that for every \( w \in R(U) \), there exists \( v = \tilde{U}^+ w \in R(U^T) \) such that \( \tilde{U}v = \tilde{U} \tilde{U}^+ w = U^T U w = w \).

Therefore, \( \tilde{U} \) is a linear bijective homomorphism, or equivalently, a linear isomorphism.
