# SIM Card Vulnerability and Data Download via SMS-PP

## Overview
This document details a specific vulnerability in SIM cards that can be exploited through the use of the SIM Application Toolkit (STK) and USIM Application Toolkit (USAT). The vulnerability allows an attacker to send specially crafted SMS messages, causing the mobile device to automatically reply without user intervention. This can lead to financial exploitation and other malicious activities.

## File Reading on SIM
The following table shows the result of file reading on a SIM where "Data download via SMS-PP" is present.

### Type of Message Sent
- **PID (Protocol Identifier)**: 0x7F (USIM Data Download)
- **DCS (Data Coding Scheme)**: Class 2 message type

### Procedure
According to GSM 11.14, if the service "data download via SMS Point-to-point" is allocated and activated in the SIM Service Table, the Mobile Equipment (ME) should follow this procedure:
1. When the ME receives a Short Message with protocol identifier = SIM data download, and data coding scheme = class 2 message, it shall pass the message transparently to the SIM using the ENVELOPE (SMS-PP DOWNLOAD) command.
2. The ME shall not display the message or alert the user of a short message waiting.

In other words, the phone will not display anything, and the user will not be aware of the attack.

### Secure Command SMS Header
- **Security Parameter Indicator (SPI)**: 2 octets long
  - **First SPI Octet**: See Figure 10
  - **Second SPI Octet**: See Figure 11

The second byte of the SPI determines how the proof of receipt (PoR) is sent:
- **SMS-DELIVER-REPORT**: The phone reports the status of the message to the network.
- **SMS-SUBMIT**: The phone sends a reply to the original sender.

### Vulnerability Exploitation
- **Behavior with PoR set to SMS-SUBMIT**: The phone sends a reply message to the original sender.
- **Behavior with PoR set to DELIVER REPORT**: The phone reports an error to the network, leading to repeated attempts to send the message.

### Wireshark Captures
- **Figure 12**: Receipt of the STK message
- **Figure 13**: Receipt of the STK message with PID set to "SIM Data download" and DCS to "SIM specific message" class 2
- **Figure 14**: GSM SIM packet
- **Figure 15**: Automated SMS-SUBMIT
- **Figure 16**: GSM SIM packet with STK reply
- **Figure 17**: Communication between the phone and the SIM
- **Figure 18**: Communication between the phone and the SIM
- **Figure 19**: Report error

### Results and Impact
- **Automatic Reply**: The phone sends an automatic reply to the original sender.
- **Message Blocking**: The phone cannot receive any messages until the malformed one expires.

### Discovery and Reporting
- **Discovery**: June 2010
- **Reported to CERT**: August 26, 2010
- **CVE Assignment**: CVE-2010-3612 (not yet published)

### Attack Method
- **STK/USAT Implementation**: The issue only affects SIM cards with STK/USAT implemented.
- **Financial Impact**: By using a premium rate number, the attacker can gain significantly more than the cost of sending the message.
- **SMSC Providers**: Some providers correctly forward APDU packets, allowing the attacker to spoof the sender number.

### Protection Measures
- **Filtering Command Messages**: Mobile operators can filter command messages not coming from themselves.
- **User Confirmation**: Some mobile devices can ask the user to confirm SIM actions.
- **Deactivate Services**: Use a SIM card with "data download via SMS Point-to-point" deactivated or without any Toolkit Application.
- **Use Specific Devices**: Use a Nokia DCT3 phone and stay connected with the F-BUS cable and Wireshark open.
