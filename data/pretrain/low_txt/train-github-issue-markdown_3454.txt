Please exercise extreme caution when merging merge requests (MRs) into the `master` branch, as Travis CI has been completely disabled for the SciPy project. Consequently, it will not display a red or green status indicator in our testing matrix. This situation is particularly unfortunate, as it occurs just days before the planned branching of `1.6.0`. We will need to migrate the jobs to other continuous integration (CI) services.

Here are the screenshots from our Travis CI page illustrating the current state:

Thank you for your attention and cooperation during this transition.
