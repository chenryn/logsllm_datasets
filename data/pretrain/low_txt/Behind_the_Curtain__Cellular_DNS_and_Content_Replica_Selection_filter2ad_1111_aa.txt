## Abstract
The Domain Name System (DNS) plays a critical role in the performance of smart devices within cellular networks. Beyond name resolution, DNS is often used to direct users to nearby content caches for improved performance. Surprisingly, there is limited understanding of the structure of cellular DNS and its effectiveness as a client localization method.

In this paper, we examine cellular network DNS and uncover several features, such as the opaqueness of cellular networks and inconsistencies between clients and resolvers, which make it unsuitable for client localization in modern cellular networks. We study these issues in two leading mobile network markets, the US and South Korea, using a dataset from over 340 volunteer devices to probe the DNS infrastructure of each client’s cellular provider. Our findings highlight the extent of the problem regarding replica selection and compare its localization performance against public DNS alternatives. Notably, we find that public DNS can provide equal or better replica performance over 75% of the time, underscoring the poor localization capabilities of cellular DNS.

## 1. Introduction
Smart devices are increasingly becoming the primary or sole point of Internet access for a growing number of users. Currently, nearly a quarter of web traffic is mobile, and industry studies predict a fourfold increase in global mobile data traffic by 2018, driven by rising data demands and the proliferation of smartphones and tablets [7].

Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are responsible for delivering most of today's Internet data. CDNs replicate popular content on servers worldwide and redirect users to "nearby" replica servers on demand. The Domain Name System (DNS) is crucial in this process, as CDN redirection and, consequently, the performance of content delivery, typically depend on the location of users' DNS resolvers [25].

Given the importance of content and the critical role of DNS in both name resolution and localization in today's networks, it is surprising how little is known about the infrastructure and configuration of cellular network DNS and its impact on content distribution. The 2011 study by Xu et al. [25] is the most comprehensive analysis of the US cellular network infrastructure, combining data from DNS logs, smartphone users, and server logs. For the radio technologies in their study—3G UMTS and EVDO—the authors noted the dominant role of radio latency and the limited number of network ingress points. They concluded that, in that setting, the best option for content providers was to locate servers close to these ingress points and that, given the restricted routing in these cellular networks, choosing content servers based on local DNS servers was sufficiently accurate.

However, the recent growth of 4G access technologies, such as LTE, has radically changed the landscape. Service providers worldwide are rolling out 4G networks to meet users' increasing demand for faster, higher-bandwidth connections. The latest Cisco VNI report estimates that by 2018, the majority of North American devices and connections will have 4G capability. While 4G will account for 15% of worldwide connections, these connections will be responsible for 51% of traffic. Compared to 3G networks, 4G LTE presents a significantly different network with a much larger number of ingress points and offers much lower radio access latency and variance. These changes make accurate content replica selection critical to the performance of end users in cellular networks.

In this paper, we closely examine cellular network DNS and replica selection in the two fastest-growing 4G LTE markets: the US and South Korea [12]. Using a dataset of more than 280,000 experiments from over 340 globally distributed mobile devices, we probe the DNS infrastructure of each client’s cellular provider and the content replicas they are redirected to.

Our analysis reveals the impact of network opaqueness and client-to-resolver inconsistency on the performance of content delivery in next-generation mobile networks. As part of our study, we compare client/replica mappings through cellular DNS with those achieved through public DNS alternatives. We show that, in contrast to wired networks and despite providers’ knowledge of clients’ locations, public DNS and the DNS of cell network providers yield comparable performance for replica selection.

In summary, our major contributions are:
- In Section 3, we describe our data sources and data collection methodology.
- In Section 4, we detail the results of our investigation into cellular network DNS structure and behavior.
- In Section 5, we present the first analysis of the interaction between cellular DNS and content replica selection in 4G networks.
- In Section 6, we present the first comparison between cellular DNS and public DNS in resolution and replica selection performance.
- In Section 7, we discuss the impact of cellular provider DNS and the implications of our findings for content delivery networks.
- In Section 8, we review closely related work.
- In Section 9, we conclude.

## 2. Background and Motivation
### 2.1 Cellular Network Architecture
LTE has been rapidly growing since its introduction in 2009. Service providers are busy rolling out 4G LTE networks to meet users' increasing demand for faster, higher-bandwidth connections. LTE promises speeds up to 150/75 Mbps of downstream/upstream throughput, significantly faster than what is possible in existing 3G networks. The 2014 Cisco VNI report estimates that, by 2018, the majority of North American devices and connections will have 4G capability.

Transitioning to 4G LTE requires cellular operators to make substantial changes to their core networks, flattening their architectures and moving to an all-IP network. For example, LTE introduces an enhanced radio access component, the eNodeB, which removes the need for previous hierarchical structures such as the Radio Network Controller (RNC) by combining its functionality into a single node. These changes are illustrated in Figure 1. LTE also requires operators to switch to the Evolved Packet Core (EPC), which necessitates an all-IP network [6], reducing the need for legacy, circuit-based technologies.

For content delivery, 4G LTE cellular networks are increasing the number of ingress/egress locations for cellular traffic. Prior work on cellular network structure concluded that CDNs had limited options from outside the cellular network to improve user experience [25]. The significant fraction of radio latency, combined with the limited number of ingress points into the cellular network, meant that CDNs had little control over user end-to-end latency. The significantly larger number of ingress points, a trend clear in Zariﬁs et al. [26] and in our own results (Section 5), means that CDNs have more options for placing and choosing content caches. These architectural changes and the radical improvements in radio access technology suggest it is time to revisit the effectiveness of content delivery and the impact of DNS-based server selection in cellular networks.

### 2.2 Mobile Content Delivery
CDNs host and deliver the majority of mobile web content. As in the wired Internet, most CDNs use the local DNS resolver (LDNS) of clients to locate them and find nearby replica servers for content delivery.

When a client requests an object hosted by a CDN, the client’s local DNS resolver contacts the authoritative DNS (ADNS) of the domain name run by the CDN. The CDN uses the location of the client’s DNS resolver as an approximate location for the client and redirects the client to nearby content servers. In wired networks, this approach has been shown to be sufficiently accurate, except when paired with certain ISP configurations or the use of public DNS services [18].

In cellular networks, however, CDNs have limited client network localization information. Firewall and NAT policies of cellular operators prohibit external entities like CDNs from probing clients or infrastructure in their network. Even if these policies did not exist, Balakrishnan et al. [3] showed the failure of IP-based identification and geolocation in cellular networks, partly due to the ephemeral and itinerant nature of mobile clients' IPs—IPs change rapidly, and similar IPs are assigned to geographically distant devices.

Our experiments uncovered a wide range of performance results across the CDN replicas seen by clients in cellular networks. Figure 2 clearly shows this as the CDF of the differential performance of replica HTTP latency (time-to-first-byte) when accessing four different domains. The CDFs show, for various US and South Korean carriers, the difference between each replica observed by clients and their best-seen replica.

While the degree of replica differential performance varies based on carrier and domain, we find replica latency increases ranging from 50% to 100% in all networks. In an extreme case, we find clients experiencing over 400% increases in latency in over 40% of the accesses to some key websites.

## 3. Methodology Overview
Our analysis is based on data collected by end-user devices through two mobile apps sharing a common measurement experimentation library. The following paragraphs describe our measurement platform, experiments, and methodology.

### 3.1 Data Sources
The measurements used in this paper come from over 348 globally distributed Android mobile clients running our measurement application. The data was collected from two mobile applications posted to Google’s Play Store, each packaged with the same network measurement library. For the purpose of this paper, we restricted our dataset to the 158 clients reporting to be in the top four cellular providers within the US: Sprint, Verizon Wireless, T-Mobile, and AT&T.
