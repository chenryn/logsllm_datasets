## Introduction to Cryptography

### Basic Setup
- **Sender:** Alice
- **Receiver:** Bob
- **Untrustworthy Network:** Eve (potential eavesdropper or attacker)

### Motivations for Cryptography
1. **Data Privacy:** Communication channels may be spying on our data.
2. **Data Integrity:** Communication channels may modify our data.

### Key Concepts in Cryptography
- **Cryptography:** The practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversaries.
- **Confidentiality:** Ensures that Eve cannot infer information about the content of the message.
- **Integrity:** Ensures that Eve cannot modify the message without this being detected.
- **Authenticity:** Ensures that Bob is convinced that the message originated from Alice.

## Commonly Used Cryptographic Systems

### Symmetric-Key Cryptography
- **Algorithms:** AES-128, AES-192, AES-256, AES-GCM, ChaCha20, HMAC-SHA-256, Poly1305, SHA-2, SHA-3, Salsa20

### Public-Key Cryptography
- **Algorithms:** BN-254, Curve25519, DH, DSA, ECDH, ECDSA, EdDSA, NIST P-256, NIST P-384, NIST P-521, RSA encryption, RSA signature, secp256k1

## Post-Quantum Cryptography

### Introduction
- **Definition:** Cryptography under the assumption that the attacker has a quantum computer.
- **Key Developments:**
  - 1994: Shor's quantum algorithm.
  - 1996: Grover's quantum algorithm.
  - 2003: Term "Post-quantum cryptography" introduced by Daniel J. Bernstein.
  - 2006: First International Workshop on Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQCrypto).
  - 2015: NIST hosts its first workshop on post-quantum cryptography.
  - 2016: NIST announces a standardization project for post-quantum systems.
  - 2017: Deadline for submissions to the NIST competition.
  - 2019: Second round of NIST competition begins.
  - 2020: Third round of NIST competition begins.

### NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Competition
- **Submissions:**
  - 21 December 2017: NIST posts 69 submissions from 260 people.
  - By end of 2017: 8 out of 69 submissions attacked.
  - By end of 2018: 22 out of 69 submissions attacked.
  - 30 January 2019: 26 candidates retained for the second round.
  - By end of 2019: 30 out of 69 submissions attacked.
  - 22 July 2020: 15 candidates retained for the third round.

### Merges and Attacks
- **Merges for the Second Round:**
  - HILA5 & Round2
  - LAKE, LOCKER, & Ouroboros-R
  - LEDAkem & LEDApkc
  - NTRUEncrypt & NTRU-HRSS-KEM

- **Merges for the Third Round:**
  - Classic McEliece & NTS-KEM

- **Attacks:**
  - Some submissions had less security than claimed.
  - Some were completely broken.
  - Attack scripts were provided for some submissions.

### National Academy of Sciences (US) Report
- **Report Date:** 4 December 2018
- **Key Findings:**
  - **Finding 1:** It is highly unlikely that a quantum computer capable of compromising RSA 2048 or similar discrete logarithm-based public key cryptosystems will be built within the next decade.
  - **Finding 10:** Despite the low likelihood, the development, standardization, and deployment of post-quantum cryptography are critical to prevent potential security and privacy disasters. All encrypted data recorded today and stored for future use will be vulnerable once a large-scale quantum computer is developed.

## Research and Development Stages

### Stages of Research
1. **Define the Goals:**
   - Establish the objectives of the cryptographic system.
2. **Explore Space of Cryptosystems:**
   - Investigate various cryptographic algorithms and schemes.
3. **Study Algorithms for Attackers:**
   - Analyze potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors.
4. **Focus on Secure Cryptosystems:**
   - Develop and refine secure cryptographic protocols.
5. **Study Algorithms for Users:**
   - Ensure usability and efficiency for end-users.
6. **Study Implementations on Real Hardware:**
   - Test and optimize implementations on actual hardware.
7. **Study Side-Channel and Fault Attacks:**
   - Address and mitigate side-channel and fault attacks.
8. **Focus on Secure, Reliable Implementations:**
   - Ensure the robustness and reliability of the implementations.
9. **Focus on Performance Requirements:**
   - Meet performance benchmarks and requirements.
10. **Integrate into Real-World Applications:**
    - Seamlessly integrate the cryptographic solutions into real-world applications.

### Warning
- **Waterfall Data Flow:** A linear, sequential approach is often undesirable. An iterative and agile approach is recommended for better outcomes.
