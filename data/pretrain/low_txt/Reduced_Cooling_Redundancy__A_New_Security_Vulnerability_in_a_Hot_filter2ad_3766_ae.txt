### Thermal Impacts and Mitigation Mechanisms

A thermal-aware load balancing mechanism can effectively mitigate the negative impacts of local hotspots, enabling further actions such as dynamic voltage and frequency scaling to reduce temperatures within these hotspots.

### Prototype Implementation and Experimentation

We implemented a simple prototype of the proposed thermal-aware load balancing mechanism and conducted an experiment to demonstrate its effectiveness. In our prototype, we maintain a list of locations with significant air recirculation effects, particularly under thermal attacks, due to their physical positions. Virtual machines (VMs) in these areas are less likely to be allocated to users. The configuration of the target data center is the same as described in Section V, with an initial system utilization of 25%.

In the experiment, we simulated a thermal attack using workloads that consume 20% more power than regular workloads. The attacker gradually increased the number of servers under attack, while the supply air temperature was fixed at 16°C. We measured the inlet temperature of the local hotspot with the highest temperature under different numbers of attack servers. The results, illustrated in Figure 18, show that the “+” line represents the results using thermal-aware load balancing, while the “x” line indicates the results under the original utilization-based load balancing policy. The cooling system could not keep the hotspot below the redline threshold using the original policy, but our thermal-aware load balancing lowered the temperature by more than 1°C and kept the hotspot safe under the thermal attack.

### Overall Effectiveness and Future Work

The proposed thermal-aware load balancing is simple and straightforward to implement, significantly improving the robustness of data centers against thermal attacks. However, in an oversubscribed data center, reactive thermal management may still fail to handle more severe attacks with many servers running malicious thermal-intensive workloads simultaneously. In future work, we plan to develop more advanced proactive defense strategies to detect thermal anomalies in real-time and prevent potential hotspots from overheating themselves and surrounding servers. These more effective defense systems should have the following capabilities:
1. Robust anomaly detection, focusing on thermal-intensive workloads at chip and server levels.
2. Cost-effective sensing solutions to profile thermal dynamics by deploying sensors, considering costs, networking traffic, locations, and sense ranges.
3. Proactive thermal management at rack and data center levels, leveraging energy storage technologies such as phase change materials [46].

### Related Work

#### Thermal/Power Threats
Previous studies have focused on thermal attacks on individual components. Kong et al. [32] studied thermal attacks on instruction caches, where malicious code heated non-traditional hotspots to avoid dynamic thermal management (DTM). A heating attack on flash memory devices using an inexpensive laser-diode module was studied in [47], leading to compromised memory contents. Paul et al. [41] launched a thermal attack on disk storages by increasing power consumption through intensive hot seeks, causing DTM to throttle the disk. Hasan et al. [26] conducted a heat-based attack on Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) by creating a hotspot in one malicious thread. Thermal covert channel attacks based on CPU core temperature variations were presented in [39], [16]. While these works provide insights into thermal attacks on individual components, they do not address the broader impacts on servers and data centers.

Wu et al. [51] conducted energy attacks on servers, achieving up to a 42.3% increase in power consumption. Xu et al. [53] demonstrated the vulnerability of cloud services to power attacks due to power oversubscription at data centers. Islam et al. [28] proposed using a hot air recirculation-based thermal side channel to infer power usage and launch power attacks. Even battery-backed data centers are vulnerable to such attacks [33]. Power attacks differ from thermal attacks in that they aim to generate a power spike within a short period, causing a power outage. Thermal attacks, while more stealthy, can lead to hardware failure and shutdown for self-protection.

#### Cooling Strategies in Data Centers
Various cooling strategies have been proposed, including the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to simulate air recirculation in computing rooms [34]. CFD helps in placing Computer Room Air Conditioners (CRAC) and servers efficiently, reducing cooling costs. However, these strategies focus on optimizing cooling power without considering the risk of thermal attacks.

#### Impact of Temperature on Servers
The impact of temperature on servers has been extensively studied. El-Sayed et al. [19] found a strong correlation between temperature variation and hardware failures. Sankar et al. [45] reported a strong correlation between temperature and hard disk failures. Coskun et al. [18] studied the reliability of job scheduling and power management methods, proposing a fine-grained technique to simulate thermal behaviors and input them into a reliability model. PGCapping [37] integrates various techniques to optimize multiprocessor performance within a power cap.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we presented a new security threat called thermal attack on data centers. We conducted a real server measurement study to investigate the thermal conditions of a physical server and proposed effective attack vectors for both virtualized and non-virtualized environments. We simulated rack-level and datacenter-level thermal attacks using a real-world data center trace, presenting damage analysis at both the server and data center levels. Our results show that thermal attacks can degrade performance and reliability, cause local hotspots, increase cooling costs, and even lead to cooling failures. Finally, we introduced a simple thermal-aware load balancing mechanism to help data centers defend against thermal attacks, paving the way for more sophisticated defenses.
