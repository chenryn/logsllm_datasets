# An Empirical Study of the Cost of DNS-over-HTTPS

## Abstract
This paper presents an empirical study on the overheads and performance implications of using DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH). We analyze the additional layers and protocols involved in DoH, including HTTP/2, TLS, and TCP. Our findings indicate that while DoH introduces significant overhead, it can be mitigated by using persistent connections. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of DoH on web page load times and find that, despite the added overhead, the overall user experience remains largely unaffected.

## 1. Introduction
DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) is a protocol designed to enhance the privacy and security of DNS queries by encrypting them over HTTPS. This study aims to quantify the overheads introduced by DoH and assess its impact on web browsing performance.

## 2. Overheads in DNS-over-HTTPS

### 2.1. Layered Analysis
We analyzed the overheads introduced by each layer in the DoH stack, including HTTP/2, TLS, and TCP. The distribution of body sizes across different cases shows that Google tends to send slightly larger bodies in extreme cases.

### 2.2. Persistent Connections
Using a persistent connection in HTTP/2 reduces the amount of data exchanged. Differential headers and management messages are key features that contribute to this reduction. For non-persistent connections, the overhead is dominated by the server certificate exchange, while persistent connections reuse established connections, leading to lower median overhead values.

### 2.3. Summary
Many one-time overheads required for TCP, TLS, and HTTP connection setup and management can be amortized with persistent connections. However, even in this case, the median overhead caused by TLS and TCP layers is comparable to the size of the actual DNS message.

## 3. Performance Impact of DoH

### 3.1. Experimental Setup
We used Firefox to measure webpage load times for the top 1,000 ranked webpages in the Alexa ranking. We compared the performance of local resolvers, Google's and Cloudflare's public resolvers, and DoH. Each website was loaded three times with the browser cache purged before each iteration.

### 3.2. Results
- **DNS Resolution Times**: Cloud-based name resolution via UDP leads to faster resolution times than local resolvers. Cloudflare is faster than Google. DoH results in longer DNS resolution times due to the added overhead of encryption and transport.
- **Page Load Times**: Despite longer DNS resolution times, page load times are comparable for all resolution methods. Cloud-based DNS services offer slightly faster page load times, but the difference between legacy DNS and DoH is minimal.

### 3.3. Additional Experiments
Experiments from PlanetLab, though limited, confirmed that DNS resolution via DoH takes longer, but the overall page load times remain similar.

## 4. Conclusion
Switching to DNS-over-HTTPS does not significantly impact page loading times. This means it is feasible to benefit from the better privacy guarantees of DoH without sacrificing user-perceived performance.

## 5. Related Work
DNS-over-HTTPS is a relatively new protocol. Previous works have discussed the benefits of encrypted DNS but have not delved into the detailed performance implications of DoH. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the overheads and performance impacts of DoH.
