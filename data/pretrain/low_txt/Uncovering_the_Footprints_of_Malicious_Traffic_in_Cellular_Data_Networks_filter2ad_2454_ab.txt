### Analysis of Prominent Threats in Mobile Networks

To better understand the nature of prominent threats, we have classified the top 15 threats (either mobile-only or cross-device) affecting the most number of mobile devices in the network into four different classes based on their unique characteristics. These classifications are detailed in Table 2. Below, we describe the characteristics of each malware category and their impact on end users:

#### Trojan Threats
Trojan threats masquerade as benign applications, such as free antivirus solutions, to cause harm to user devices. The damage can include unauthorized remote access, hijacking of device resources, turning the device into a bot or proxy, and stealing user information. This class of malware is currently the most effective form of threat affecting mobile devices. Notably, our analysis detected instances of the Zeus trojan affecting 82 distinct iOS-based mobile devices. While mobile variants of this threat have been observed on other platforms like Windows Mobile and Android, this is the first known instance affecting iOS devices. Unfortunately, further exploration of this malware variant was limited by the dataset.

#### Privacy Leakage Threats
Privacy leakage threats involve the malicious exfiltration of sensitive data such as the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number or device location information through HTTP headers or URIs. Over 1200 unique mobile devices were affected by these threats, making them one of the most prevalent attacks in our dataset. Although traditional desktop malware also leaks sensitive data, this issue is more pronounced in the mobile ecosystem due to the sensitive nature of data stored on mobile devices, over-privileged applications, and the availability of third-party app stores. Table 3 categorizes the types of privacy leakage issues revealed in our ground truth data. Such information allows attackers to uniquely observe and track targeted users, posing a serious violation of user privacy.

#### Adware and Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUA)
Adware and PUA sneak onto devices deceptively, making them difficult to detect and remove. Their primary motive is to display unwanted advertisements, often in the form of pop-up ads. While some of these apps may be merely annoying, they can also act as dangerous spyware, monitoring user behavior and collecting data without consent.

#### SIP Threats
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is widely used for controlling multimedia communication sessions, such as VoIP calls over the internet. Our results indicate that vulnerabilities in SIP are a popular target for attackers seeking to exploit mobile devices. These vulnerabilities can potentially allow attackers to eavesdrop on confidential voice communications or launch denial-of-service attacks, as reported in previous studies [11,12].

### Infection Rates of Popular Mobile Platforms

The vulnerability of different mobile platforms to security threats has been a topic of debate. Using ground truth data from an operational cellular network, we analyzed the following:
- The proportion of devices belonging to each identifiable mobile platform.
- The infection rate of each platform.
- The proportion of alerts originating from each platform.

Table 4 shows that Android is the most vulnerable platform with an infection rate of 0.39%, slightly higher than recent independent studies [3] and three times the rate reported by Google [13]. BlackBerry follows with an infection rate of 0.32%, and iOS with 0.22%. These figures suggest that the walled garden approach and security through obscurity are not sufficient to prevent malware spread. Despite their security capabilities, BlackBerry devices, often used for business, have a high infection rate, possibly due to the valuable data they store. Windows-based mobile platforms, however, have a lower infection rate, as noted in recent industry reports [14].

### Network Footprints of Cellular Threats

We investigated whether network access patterns associated with malicious domains/hosts exhibit distinct statistical features compared to benign counterparts. Many existing studies use various methodologies, including DNS and WHOIS features, host-based features, and content analysis, to detect malicious domains/URLs [4,5,6,7]. Our study aims to complement these methods by examining statistical network features, which can be useful when other data sources are unavailable.

#### Feature Extraction and Selection
We built a set of known malicious domains using the ground truth alert database and created a set of benign domains by randomly selecting those visited by subscriber devices but not listed in the ground truth. We extracted lexical and statistical network features as follows:
- **Lexical Features:** Each domain/host name was broken into tokens based on the '.' delimiter, resulting in 6,729 unique lexical tags. The frequency of each tag in a domain name was used as a feature, following the bag-of-words model.
- **Statistical Network Features:** From DPI records, we extracted 12 heuristic features, including uplink and downlink data transfer volumes, connection statistics, and entropy measures.

Using the Chi-squared statistic, we selected 53 distinct attributes (10 statistical network features and 43 lexical features) that best distinguish between malicious and benign hosts. Figure 3 shows the CDF of six selected network features, highlighting significant differences in their distributions.

#### Classification of Malicious/Benign Domains
To classify domains/hosts, we used the Random Forest ensemble learner, constructing multiple decision trees and aggregating their predictions. We evaluated the model using n-fold cross-validation (n=10) and ran experiments with varying proportions of malicious and non-malicious hosts, using:
- Statistical network features alone (α),
- Lexical features alone (β),
- Both statistical network and lexical features (γ).

Figure 4a and b present the ROC curves for two cross-validation experiments, showing that combining statistical network features with lexical features yields better true positive rates at lower false positive rates. Table 5 confirms that the ROC area is higher when both feature sets are used, indicating that statistical network features complement lexical features and enhance detection capabilities.

### Conclusions

Our study, using data from a major US cellular carrier, reveals that 0.17% of mobile devices are affected by security threats, a significant increase from the previously reported 0.0009%. We combined multiple datasets to uncover details about the threats affecting mobile devices and their unique characteristics. Our analysis of infection rates across popular mobile platforms showed that Android remains the most affected, followed by BlackBerry and iOS. We also characterized the network footprint of malicious and benign domains, demonstrating the potential of statistical network features to aid in the detection of malicious domains/hosts when used in conjunction with lexical features. Future work will focus on a deeper analysis of these findings.
