**ATT&CK ID:** T1105  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Ingress Tool Transfer

Adversaries may transfer tools or other files from an external system into a compromised environment. These tools or files can be copied from an adversary-controlled external system to the victim's network via the command and control (C2) channel or through alternative protocols such as FTP. Once these tools or files are present within the victim's network, adversaries may also transfer or spread them between devices within the compromised environment, a technique known as Lateral Tool Transfer.
