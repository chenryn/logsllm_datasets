### Blue Banana: Enhancing Resilience to Avatar Mobility in Distributed MMOGs

#### Abstract
This paper introduces Blue Banana, a mechanism designed to enhance the resilience of overlays in distributed Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) by predicting and adapting to avatar movement. The study shows that Blue Banana reduces transient failures by over 20% and allows nodes to prefetch up to 430 KBytes of data about their playing area, significantly improving network performance.

#### 1. Introduction
In peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, building an overlay that efficiently supports the needs of Networked Virtual Environments (NVEs) is challenging. Most existing overlays do not account for the specific requirements of NVEs, leading to inefficiencies and transient failures. This paper presents Blue Banana, a mechanism that predicts and adapts to avatar movement, thereby enhancing the resilience and performance of the overlay.

#### 2. Mechanism Overview
Blue Banana operates by dynamically adjusting the overlay based on the predicted movement of avatars. As the number of moving avatars increases, the overlay updates proportionally to maintain efficiency. The update interval and overhead are managed to ensure minimal impact on the network.

#### 3. Performance Evaluation
The first experiment demonstrates that Blue Banana reduces transient failures and suggests that the number of prefetched nodes should be considered when handling prefetching requests. For fast-moving avatars, the node's awareness of its neighbors ahead of its movement is significantly greater with Blue Banana compared to the basic Solipsis overlay.

- **Transient Failures**: Blue Banana reduces transient failures by more than 20%.
- **Prefetching**: Nodes using Blue Banana can prefetch up to 430 KBytes of data about their playing area, which is approximately 20 times more than without it.
- **Network Overhead**: The overhead induced by Blue Banana is low, with around five messages per node per second, which is negligible compared to the maintenance messages sent by a basic Solipsis node.

#### 4. Related Work
- **Un-adaptable Overlays**: Many existing P2P overlays, such as those designed for file-sharing, do not adapt to the specific needs of NVEs.
- **Adaptive Overlays**: Recent works have focused on dynamically adapting overlays to better fit the application's needs. However, these adaptations are often too dynamic, leading to inconsistencies or inefficiencies.
- **Semantic Overlays**: Some overlays, like VoroNet and RayNet, build links between semantically close peers, but they do not anticipate the application's needs in advance.

#### 5. Conclusions and Future Work
Blue Banana significantly enhances the resilience and performance of overlays in distributed MMOGs by predicting and adapting to avatar movement. Future work will focus on exploring more accurate anticipation mechanisms and studying the relative movement between avatars independently of their position to further reduce transient failures.
