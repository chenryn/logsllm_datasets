## Overview
- **What is it?**
- **Exploiting it!**
- **Fixing it!**
- **Moving Forward**
- **Wrapping Up**

## Modern Day Networks
- **Vendor Dependent**
- **Difficult to Scale**
- **Complex and Prone to Break**
- **Distributed and Often Inconsistent Configuration**
- **Uses inflexible and difficult-to-innovate protocols**
- **Unable to Consider Other Factors**
- **… And Good Luck If You Want To Change It!**

## Enter … Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
- **Separates the Control and Data Planes**
- **Forwarding Decisions Made by a Controller**
- **Routers and Switches Just Forward Packets**
- **Controllers:**
  - Programmed with intelligence
  - Full visibility of the network
  - Can consider the totality of the network before making any decision
  - Enforce granular policies
- **Switches:**
  - Bare-metal only
  - Any vendor (hardware or software)
  - Solves many problems
  - Know the state of the network rather than inferring it
  - Run development and production side-by-side
  - More practical and cost-effective

## Benefits of SDN
- **Solves Lots of Problems:**
  - Less expensive hardware
  - BGP maintenance dry-out
  - Customer egress selection
  - Better BGP security
  - Faster convergence
  - Granular peering at IXPs
  - Real-world network slicing of flow space
  - Network and server load balancing
  - Dynamic access control
  - Adaptive traffic monitoring
  - Attack detection and mitigation

## Emerging Standards
- **Old and Busted:**
  - SNMP
  - BGP
  - Netconf
  - LISP
  - PCEP
- **New Hotness:**
  - OVSDB
  - OpenFlow

## Introducing OpenFlow
- **Purpose:**
  - Execute logic at the controller
  - Update forwarding tables
- **Elements:**
  - **Controller:**
    - Secure channel
    - Full visibility and intelligent decision-making
  - **Forwarding Element:**
    - Checks flow table
    - Executes actions if match found
    - Sends packet to controller if no match
    - Updates flow table
- **Features:**
  - Flow tables
  - Match/Action entries
  - Packet header matching against 1 of N tables
  - 12 fields available for matching
  - Wildcard matching available
  - Actions: forward, drop, modify, enqueue

## Leading Platforms
- **Proprietary:**
  - Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC)
  - Cisco Extensible Network Controller (XNC)
  - HP Virtual Application Networks (VAN) SDN Controller
  - IBM Programmable Network Controller
- **Open-Source:**
  - Nox/Pox
  - Ryu
  - Floodlight
  - OpenDaylight

## Prevalence of SDN
- **Gartner: 10 critical IT trends for the next five years**
- **Major Networking Vendors Have Products or Planned for SDN**
- **InformationWeek 2013 Survey:**
  - 60% felt that SDN would be part of their network within 5 years
  - 43% already have plans to put it in production

## Protocol Weaknesses
- **Encryption and Authentication via TLS:**
  - More of a suggestion than a requirement
  - v1.0.0 over TLS
  - v1.4.0 over TCP or TLS
- **Controllers:**
  - Floodlight: No
  - OpenDaylight: Supported but not required
- **Switches:**
  - Arista: No
  - Brocade: Yes
  - Cisco: Yes
  - Dell: No
  - Extreme: Yes
  - HP: No
  - Huawei: No
  - IBM: No
  - Juniper: No
  - NEC: Yes
  - Netgear: No
  - Pronto: Yes
  - OVS: No

## Debug Ports
- **No Encryption, No Authentication, Full Control of the Switch:**
  - All via "dpctl" command-line tool
- **Vendors:**
  - Arista, Brocade, Dell, Extreme, HP, Huawei, IBM, Juniper, NEC, Netgear, Pronto, OVS

## DoS Nastiness
- **OpenFlow:**
  - Centralization entails dependency
  - Dependency can be exploited
- **Vendor Handling:**
  - Floodlight: Poorly handled
  - OpenDaylight: Unknown but worth investigating

## Tools
- **of-switch.py:**
  - Impersonates an OpenFlow switch
  - Utilizes OpenFlow v1.00
- **of-flood.py:**
  - Floods an OpenFlow controller
  - Disrupts the network and brings it down
  - Utilizes OpenFlow v1.00

## Other Controller Weaknesses
- **Floodlight:**
  - No encryption for Northbound HTTP API
  - No authentication for Northbound HTTP API
- **OpenDaylight:**
  - Encryption for Northbound HTTP API turned off by default
  - Authentication for Northbound HTTP API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with a weak default password

## Identifying Controllers and Switches
- **Currently Listening on TCP Port 6633**
- **New Port Defined: TCP Port 6653**
- **Tools:**
  - **of-check.py:**
    - Identifies OpenFlow services
    - Reports on their versions
    - Compatible with any version of OpenFlow
  - **of-enum.py:**
    - Enumerates OpenFlow endpoints
    - Reports on their type
    - Compatible with any version of OpenFlow
  - **openflow-enum.nse:**
    - Identifies OpenFlow services
    - Reports on their versions
    - Compatible with any version of OpenFlow

## Exposure
- **Data Centers/Clouds are the Killer App for SDN:**
  - NIPPON EXPRESS
  - FIDELITY INVESTMENTS
  - VMWARE
- **Starting to see it moving toward the LAN:**
  - Caltech
  - CERN
- **And WAN:**
  - Google, NTT, and AT&T

## Some Attacks
- **Small Local Area Network:**
  - One Admin Host
  - Two User Hosts
  - One Server
  - One IDS
- **Attacker will:**
  - Identify targets
  - Enumerate ACLs
  - Find sensors
- **Tool:**
  - **of-map.py:**
    - Downloads flows from an OpenFlow controller
    - Uses the flows to identify targets, target services, build ACLs, and identify sensors
    - Works with Floodlight and OpenDaylight via JSON

## Additional Attacks
- **Attacker will:**
  - Gain access to the server
  - Isolate the administrator
  - Hide from the IDS
  - Attack the server
- **Tool:**
  - **of-access.py:**
    - Modifies flows on the network through the OpenFlow controller
    - Adds or removes access for hosts
    - Applies transformations to their network activity
    - Hides activity from sensors
    - Works with Floodlight and OpenDaylight via JSON

## Zero-Day Exploit
- **Opendaylight has other southbound APIs besides OpenFlow:**
  - No encryption for Southbound Netconf API
  - No authentication for Southbound Netconf API
  - Just connect and exchange messages
  - XML-RPC
  - Runs as "Root"

## If No Exploit
- **Service Not Available or They Fix It:**
  - Password guessing
  - Default password weak
  - Strong passwords turned off
  - No account lockout
  - No SYSLOG output
  - Repeat!

## Other Exploits Waiting to Be Found

  - Java Debug Access

## Where to Look
- **Identify Additional Encryption and Authentication Issues:**
  - Use them to explore
  - Direct access
  - Traditional vulnerabilities
  - Start with the basics
  - Protocol messaging
  - Injection for RFI/LFI, etc.
  - Information disclosure
  - Unauthorized access
  - DoS

## Available Solutions
- **For Now:**
  - Transport Layer Security
  - Hardening
  - VLAN
  - Code review
- **For the Future:**
  - Denial of Service (SDN Architecture)
  - Network Partitioning
  - Controller Clustering
  - Static Flow Entries
  - Modification (SDN Applications)
  - Traffic Counters
  - Respond to Abnormalities
  - Verification (SDN Operations)

## Impact
- **With this one box, you get everything they have:**
  - Own any data they own
  - Control any aspect of their operation
  - Control their fate
  - Opens up a world of possibilities

## How It Could Go Right
- **Vendor Independence and Ultimately Lower Cost:**
  - Networks that match the application and the business needs
  - Faster evolution of the network
  - Production-scale simulation and experimentation
  - Exchangeable network aspects
  - Dynamic and truly active defenses

## How It Could Go Wrong
- **Denial of Service:**
  - Peer Node
  - External Node
  - Selectively dropping traffic
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM):**
  - Entire networks
  - Local subnets or hosts
- **Shadow Operations:**
  - Darknets
  - Uber Admins

## Making the Difference
- **Traditional Means of Securing Controllers Still Apply:**
  - Security needs to be part of the discussion
  - Until now, how SDN can help security
  - But how secure is SDN?
  - Analyses being done, but by outsiders
  - Traditional approach and 2-D
  - Controller’s need a security reference and audit capability
