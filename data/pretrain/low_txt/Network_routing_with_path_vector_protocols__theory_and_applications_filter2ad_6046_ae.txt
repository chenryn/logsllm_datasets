### 4.4 Function F Decreases

We analyze the function \( F \) under different conditions:

1. **\( R = Q \) and \( R = \text{none} \)**:
   - The coordinate \( f_j \) decreases by one.
   - Since \( R = Q \) and \( R = \text{none} \), the function \( F \) decreases.

2. **\( R = Q \) and \( R \neq \text{none} \)**:
   - The coordinate \( f_j \) decreases by one.
   - The coordinate \( f_k \) decreases by one.
   - The coordinate \( f_{M+1} \) may increase.
   - Because \( R = Q \) and \( R \neq \text{none} \), we have \( k < M + 1 \), and the function \( F \) decreases.

3. **\( R \neq Q \) and \( R = \text{none} \)**:
   - The coordinate \( f_j \) may decrease by one.
   - The coordinate \( f_k \) decreases by one.
   - The coordinate \( f_{M+1} \) may increase.
   - Because \( R \neq Q \) and \( R = \text{none} \), we have \( k < M + 1 \), and the function \( F \) decreases.

4. **\( R \neq Q \), \( R \neq \text{none} \), and \( R \neq uv \circ P \)**:
   - The coordinate \( f_j \) decreases by one.
   - The coordinate \( f_k \) decreases by one.
   - The coordinate \( f_l \) increases.
   - Because \( R \neq uv \circ P \), path \( R \) was available for selection at node \( u \) before the signaling routing message was received.
   - Since \( R \neq Q \) and path \( Q \) was chosen by \( u \) before the signaling routing message, \( Q \) weighs less than \( R \) or has the same weight as \( R \) but is preferred at node \( u \).
   - Hence, \( k < l \) and the function \( F \) decreases.

### 9. Algebra and BGP

We now discuss the use of the algebraic framework in the design and implementation of policy guidelines for BGP. The ideas presented in this section are preliminary and need to be evaluated through actual implementations. We view the algebraic framework as a mathematical template for setting up policy guidelines, expecting its semantic value to help in their translation to and from some router configuration language [5].

- **Labels**: Correspond to the class of possible types of relationships between pairs of nodes and the relevant properties of the links joining them.
- **Signatures**: Reflect properties of paths that nodes are willing to keep and share with their neighbors.
- **Mapping of signatures into weights**: Ensures the path vector protocol converges and satisfies any additional requirements from the policy guidelines.

#### Mapping Policy Guidelines to BGP Mechanisms

1. **Association of Signatures with BGP Routes**:
   - Achieved using the Community attribute.

2. **Assignment of Weights to Community Values**:
   - Created using the LOCAL-PREF attribute.
   - To allow ASes to apply individual routing policies, each weight should correspond to a range of contiguous LOCAL-PREF values, with non-overlapping ranges.
   - A router holding a route with a given Community value can choose any LOCAL-PREF value within the associated range.

Routers must be configured to respect the correspondence between Community values and ranges of LOCAL-PREF values and to convert among Community values representing signatures. The decision of which router performs which conversions is external to the algebra.

For example, suppose routers \( u \) and \( v \) in different ASes have a relationship described by label \( l \). If \( \alpha \) is the Community value (signature) of a route held by \( v \), after the route is advertised to \( u \), its Community value becomes \( l \oplus \alpha \). The algebra remains the same whether the new Community value is computed at \( v \) before the route is advertised, at \( u \) after the route is received, or shared between \( u \) and \( v \).

### 10. Conclusions

We have introduced modern algebraic concepts to the design and study of routing strategies supported by path vector protocols. The convergence properties of these protocols are related to the monotonicity and isotonicity of the underlying algebra. Monotonicity is necessary and sufficient for convergence, and monotonicity together with isotonicity ensures convergence to optimal paths. Freeness is identified as the property that guarantees convergence independently of the relative preferences given by nodes to paths with the same weight.

The algebraic approach unifies previous results on optimal path routing and various guidelines for policy-based routing, making it easy to check the validity of new routing strategies. As examples, we have provided guidelines for policy-based routing that consider backup relationships while rendering paths with valleys unusable, and derived a sufficient condition for iBGP convergence in Internet domains using route reflection. Finally, we have used the framework to gain insights into QoS extensions for BGP.

Most of the theory developed here can be adapted to distance vector protocols, provided they are supplemented with a mechanism to address the count-to-infinity problem. This can be achieved by equipping signaling routing messages with a counter that is incremented each time it is passed from one node to another, limiting the counter value to stop the counting to infinity.
