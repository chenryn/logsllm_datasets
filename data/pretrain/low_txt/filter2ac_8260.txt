Alejandro Mayorkas was sworn in as the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) by President Joe Biden on February 2, 2021. As the first Latino and immigrant to be confirmed for this position, Mayorkas brings a distinguished 30-year career in law enforcement and legal practice to his role.

Prior to his current appointment, Mayorkas served as the Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security from 2013 to 2016, and as the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) from 2009 to 2013. During his tenure at DHS, he spearheaded several critical initiatives, including the development and implementation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. He also negotiated cybersecurity and homeland security agreements with foreign governments, led the Department's response to the Ebola and Zika outbreaks, and helped establish and manage the Blue Campaign, an effort to combat human trafficking.

Mayorkas began his government service in the Department of Justice, where he served as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Central District of California, specializing in the prosecution of white-collar crimes. After nearly nine years as a federal prosecutor, he became the youngest United States Attorney in the nation, overseeing high-profile cases involving financial fraud, violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, public corruption, violent crime, cybercrime, environmental crime, international money laundering, and securities fraud.
