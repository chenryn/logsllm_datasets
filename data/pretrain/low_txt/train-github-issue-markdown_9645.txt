**Electron Version:** 1.2.0  
**Operating System:** macOS (possibly others)

Hello,

I am the maintainer of the `serialport` project. We have been receiving numerous reports from users who are unable to use our latest release or beta release with Electron versions 1.2.x. The 1.1.x line, on the other hand, seems to work without significant issues.

While the bug reports we've received are not very detailed, a few users have managed to narrow down the problem to the version change. I have suggested reverting to version 1.1.x to see if it resolves their issues. Here are a couple of relevant GitHub issue links for reference:

- [serialport/node-serialport#838 (comment)](https://github.com/serialport/node-serialport/issues/838#issuecomment-)
- [serialport/node-serialport#856](https://github.com/serialport/node-serialport/issues/856)

For our next release, I plan to upgrade `nan`, but the changelog does not indicate any changes that should affect compatibility.

Do you have any suggestions on how to address this issue?

Thank you.
