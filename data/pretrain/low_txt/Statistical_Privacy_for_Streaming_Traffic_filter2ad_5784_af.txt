### APPENDIX

**Theorem 1.** Suppose for database \( D \), we have method \( A \) that is \(\epsilon\)-private, and method \( B \) that is \((d^*, \epsilon)\)-private. We denote the maximum and minimum \( d^* \) distance in \( D \) as \( d_{\max} \) and \( d_{\min} \). Then we have:

1. If \( B \) is \((d^*, \epsilon)\)-private, then \( B \) is \((\epsilon d_{\max})\)-private.
2. If \( A \) is \(\epsilon\)-private, then \( A \) is \((d^*, \frac{\epsilon}{d_{\min}})\)-private.

**Proof.** According to the definitions, we have:
\[ A : P(A(x) \in Z) \leq \exp(\epsilon_A) \times P(A(x') \in Z) \]
\[ B : P(B(x) \in Z) \leq \exp(\epsilon_B \times d^*(x, x')) \times P(B(x') \in Z) \]

For \( B \), we have:
\[ \epsilon_B \times d_{\min} \leq \epsilon_B \times d^*(x, x') \leq \epsilon_B \times d_{\max} \]

If \( B \) is \((d^*, \epsilon)\)-private,
\[ \frac{P(B(x) \in Z)}{P(B(x') \in Z)} = \exp(\epsilon \times d^*(x, x')) \leq \exp(\epsilon \times d_{\max}) \]

So \( B \) is at least \((\epsilon d_{\max})\)-private. Similarly, if \( A \) is \(\epsilon\)-private, let \(\epsilon' = \frac{\epsilon}{d^*(x, x')}\), we have:
\[ \epsilon' = \frac{\epsilon}{d^*(x, x')} \leq \frac{\epsilon}{d_{\min}} \]

So \( A \) is at least \((d^*, \frac{\epsilon}{d_{\min}})\)-private.
