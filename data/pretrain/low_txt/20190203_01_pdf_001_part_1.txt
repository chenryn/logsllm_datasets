## 1. Introduction

**Notice:**
The names for EDB’s products have changed. The product formerly referred to as 'EDB xDB Replication Server' is now referred to as 'EDB Postgres Replication Server'. Until a new version of this documentation is published, wherever you see 'EDB xDB Replication Server', you may substitute it with 'EDB Postgres Replication Server'. Name changes in software and software outputs will be phased in over time.

This document describes the installation, configuration, architecture, and operation of the EDB Postgres Replication Server. EDB Postgres Replication Server (formerly known as EDB xDB Replication Server) is an asynchronous replication system available for PostgreSQL® and EDB Postgres™ Advanced Server, which will be referred to as Advanced Server.

EDB Postgres Replication Server can be used to implement replication systems based on either of two different models: single-master (master-to-slave) replication or multi-master replication. Regardless of the chosen model, the system is highly flexible and user-friendly.

For single-master replication, PostgreSQL, Advanced Server, Oracle®, and Microsoft® SQL Server® are supported in various configurations, including cascading replication. This allows organizations to utilize the system in multiple use cases with a variety of benefits.

The following are some combinations of cross-database replications that EDB Postgres Replication Server supports for single-master replication:
- From Oracle to PostgreSQL
- From Oracle to Advanced Server
- From SQL Server to PostgreSQL
- From SQL Server to Advanced Server
- From Advanced Server to Oracle
- From PostgreSQL to SQL Server
- From Advanced Server to SQL Server
- Between PostgreSQL and Advanced Server

**Note:** Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC) and Oracle Exadata are not supported by EDB Postgres Replication Server. These Oracle products have not been evaluated or certified.
