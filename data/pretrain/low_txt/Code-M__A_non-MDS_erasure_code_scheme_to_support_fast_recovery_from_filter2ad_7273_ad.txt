### Complexity Analysis and Comparison of Code-M and RDP

#### 4.4 Comparisons between Code-M and RDP

**Case I: Two Failed Disks in Different Strip-Sets**

- **Decoding Complexity**: To recover the lost elements, the decoding process accesses \( L \times \frac{3C - 1}{S \times (C - 1)} \) elements.
- **Elements to Read and Write**: For each failed disk, \( 2C \) elements should be read, and \( 2C \) elements should be written.

**Case II: Two Failed Disks in Different Strip-Sets**

- **Decoding Complexity**: The decoding process accesses \( L \times \frac{3C^2 - C + 1}{S \times C \times (C - 1)} \) elements.
- **Elements to Read and Write**: For each failed disk, \( 2C \) elements should be read, and \( 2C \) elements should be written.

**Case III: Two Failed Disks in the Same Strip-Set with Distance 4**

- **Decoding Complexity**: To recover the lost elements, the decoding process accesses \( (C - 1) + 1 \) elements.
- **Elements to Write**: \( 3 \times C \) elements should be written.

**Case IV: Two Failed Disks in the Same Strip-Set with Distance 4**

- **Decoding Complexity**: To recover the lost elements, the decoding process accesses \( (C - 1) \) elements.
- **Elements to Write**: \( 4 \times C \) elements should be written.

**Comparison with RDP**

- **Single Disk Failure**:
  - **RDP**: Requires \( n - 3 \) XOR operations to recover one strip or \( n - 2 \) elements.
  - **Code-M**: The decoding complexity is \( n^2 - 5n + 6 \) XOR operations, and the I/O complexity is \( n^2 - 3n + 2 \) or \( 2 \times (n - 2) \) elements accessed.

- **Double Disk Failures**:
  - **RDP**: The decoding complexity is \( n^2 - 2n \) elements.
  - **Code-M**: The decoding complexity is \( 2n^2 - 10n + 12 \) XOR operations, and the I/O complexity is \( 2n^2 - 2n \) elements accessed.

**Scenarios for Comparison**

- **Same Number of Total Disks**:
  - **Equation 4**: For the same number of total disks.
  - **Equation 5**: For the same rate.
  - **Equation 6**: For the same capacity.

- **Reconstruction Times**:
  - **Figure 11**: Relationships between the number of disks \( n \) in RDP and \( (S, C) \) in Code-M.
  - **Figure 12**: Recovery times of Code-M and RDP with the same number of disks.
  - **Figure 13**: Recovery times of Code-M and RDP with the same rate.
  - **Figure 14**: Recovery times of Code-M and RDP with the same capacity.

**Performance Evaluation**

- **Single Disk Failure**:
  - **Code-M**: Outperforms RDP by a factor up to 5.18.
  - **RDP**: In the case of \( S = 3 \), Code-M is slightly worse than RDP (e.g., 1.002 vs. 1).

- **Double Disk Failures**:
  - **Code-M**: Consistently outperforms RDP, with a speedup factor up to 2.8.

**Conclusions and Future Work**

- **Conclusion**: We have presented a novel coding scheme, Code-M, which is a non-MDS RAID-6 construction that supports fast recovery and reduced computational and I/O complexity.
- **Future Work**:
  - **Hardware-Based Tests**: Plan to conduct hardware-based tests and compare Code-M with other non-MDS codes.
  - **Further Verification**: Investigate how to possibly implement a similar coding scheme to tolerate more than two concurrent failures.
