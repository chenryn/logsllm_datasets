### Optimized Text

In this section, we discuss the instantiation of the SPS-EQ (Structure-Preserving Signature on Equivalence Classes) with the scheme from [25], similar to the static group signature in [6]. The SPS-EQ signature will consist of 10 elements in \( G_1 \) and 4 elements in \( G_2 \). Both building blocks are secure under standard assumptions.

To accurately calculate the signature size, we need to instantiate the proof system \( \Pi_{\text{PPE}} \). This proof system is used to verify the following statement:
\[
\exists (pk_{\text{SFPK}}, r, w_1, w_2) \text{ s.t. } \text{SFPK} \land \text{IsCanonical}(pk_{\text{SFPK}}) \lor e(w_1, K_2) = e(w_2, g_2).
\]
Given that \( \text{SFPK.ChgPK}(pk_{\text{SFPK}}, r) = pk' \), and using Scheme 2, this statement can be simplified while maintaining the security proofs. Let \( pk' = (pk'_1, pk'_2) \) and \( pk_{\text{SFPK}} = (pk_1, pk_2) \). The proof can then be expressed by the pairing product equations:
\[
e(w_1, K_2) = e(w_2, g_2) \quad \text{and} \quad e(pk'_1, gr^{-1}_2) = e(g_1, g_2) \cdot e(w_1, g_2).
\]
It is evident that the witness \((r, w_1, w_2) = (0, (g_1)^{-1}, (K_1)^{-1})\) is a trapdoor witness that can be used in the security proof to create a valid proof for an arbitrary \( pk'_{\text{SFPK}} \). The canonical representative \( pk_{\text{SFPK}} \) is only used by the tracing authority to open signatures. By extracting the witness \( R = gr^{-1}_2 \), if \( pk'_2 = gx \cdot r \), then \( e(pk'_1, R) = e(gx_1, g_2) \) is a static value common for all public keys related to \( pk'_{\text{SFPK}} \). Since the tracing authority has access to the registration table containing public keys in canonical form of active members, it can still correctly open signatures without affecting any of the proofs.

Using the fine-tuned Groth-Sahai proofs presented in [24] (assuming decisional Diffie-Hellman), the proof size is 10 elements in \( G_1 \) and 8 elements in \( G_2 \). This is composed of:
1. Two group elements in \( G_2 \) for the first equation, which is linear.
2. Four elements in \( G_1 \) and \( G_2 \) for the second equation.
3. Six elements in \( G_1 \) for the three witnesses in \( G_1 \).
4. Two elements in \( G_2 \) for the witness \( r \).

Overall, the group signature consists of 28 elements in \( G_1 \), 15 in \( G_2 \), and 1 in \( \mathbb{Z}^*_p \). A comparison with existing group signature schemes is provided in Figure 5. Note that lattice-based schemes are not included in the comparison because the only constant-size scheme proposed by Ling et al. [39] is impractical.

Next, we need to instantiate the digital signature scheme DS, the public key encryption scheme PKE, and the proof system \( \Pi_{\text{GS.Judge}} \). The first two building blocks are standard and can be easily instantiated in the standard model from simple assumptions. For PKE, we can use the El Gamal encryption scheme, which is key-private. Finally, \( \Pi_{\text{GS.Judge}} \) can also be instantiated using Groth-Sahai proofs for pairing product equations [24]. This means the tracing authority must prove correct decryption of an El-Gamal ciphertext and that its public key was generated using a DDH tuple, which can be easily expressed as pairing product equations.
