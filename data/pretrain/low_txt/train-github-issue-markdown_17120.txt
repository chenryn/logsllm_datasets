### Request for Enhancements: Support for Searching and Opening .msc Files

**Feature Description:**
We would like to add support for searching and opening `.msc` files, such as `gpedit.msc`, directly from the search bar. This enhancement will enable users to open the Group Policy Editor by simply typing `gpedit.msc` or `Group Policy Editor`.

**Scope of Enhancement:**
- **Primary Functionality:** 
  - Users should be able to open `gpedit.msc` by typing either `gpedit.msc` or `Group Policy Editor` in the search bar.
- **Extended Functionality:**
  - This feature should also support other `.msc` files, including:
    - Device Manager (`devmgmt.msc`)
    - Disk Management (`diskmgmt.msc`)
    - Event Viewer (`eventvwr.msc`)
    - Other Microsoft Management Console (MMC) items.

**Additional Information:**
- In the Start Menu, these commands are currently categorized under "Control Panel" (in German: "Systemsteuerung").
- For reference, please see the attached image:

**Note from crutkas:**
This enhancement will include additional MMC items, such as Device Manager and others, making them easily accessible through the search bar.

By implementing this feature, we aim to improve user experience and streamline access to essential system management tools.
