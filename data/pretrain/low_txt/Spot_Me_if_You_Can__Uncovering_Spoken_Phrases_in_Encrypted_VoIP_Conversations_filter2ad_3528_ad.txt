### Impact of Phrase Length on Detector Performance
As the length of a phrase increases, the number of false positives from the search Hidden Markov Model (HMM) decreases, leading to an improvement in the detector's precision. Our detector achieves its best results on phrases that are at least 3 seconds long.

### Factors Affecting Recall
The most significant factor influencing our detector’s recall was not one we initially anticipated. It appears that there are some speakers in the dataset whom we can recognize with high accuracy, while others present more challenges. Our technique for synthesizing training data for the profile HMM does not seem to accurately predict the way everyone speaks. To illustrate the variability in performance across the 168 speakers in the test set, we computed the true positive rate (TPR) for each speaker, defined as the fraction of utterances from that speaker detected by our algorithm. The median TPR for speakers is 63%, and for approximately 20% of the speakers, the TPR is below 50%. When a phrase is spoken by several users for whom our synthesis techniques do not work well, the overall TPR for the phrase also suffers. This impacts both precision and recall, as TPR is a key component in both measures.

### Techniques for Mitigation
One potential method to prevent word spotting is to pad packets to a common length or at least to a coarser granularity. To explore the tradeoff between padding and search accuracy, we encrypted both our training and testing datasets to multiples of 128, 256, or 512 bits and applied our approach. The results, presented in Figure 12, show that padding is a promising mitigation technique, as it significantly reduces the overall accuracy of the search algorithm. For example, when padding to multiples of 128 bits, we achieve a recall of 0.15 at a precision of 0.16. Increasing the padding to 256-bit multiples further reduces the recall to 0.04 at a precision of 0.04. However, padding to 128, 256, and 512 bit blocks results in overheads of 8.81%, 16.5%, and 30.82%, respectively. These bandwidth estimates are likely lower than the actual overhead, as Chu notes [4], in a two-way call, each participant is idle 63% of the time, which allows for the transmission of many smaller packets. In our testing, which involves continuous speech, the smaller packets indicating silence are less prevalent.

### Related Work
In 1982, Simmons and Holdridge [29] highlighted the vulnerabilities of an early design for encrypting voice traffic using a semantically insecure version of RSA. They demonstrated that an adversary with knowledge of the recipient’s public key could recover the audio from an encrypted conversation by pre-computing ciphertexts for a moderate number of sounds and then observing when the same ciphertexts were transmitted.

More recently, the increasing popularity of Internet telephony has spurred several studies on VoIP and security. Wang et al. [39] proposed a method to track VoIP calls across anonymizing networks like Tor [6] using packet timing as a watermark. Verscheure et al. [36] introduced a passive method for identifying the endpoints of an anonymized VoIP call by observing patterns in the packet stream due to the encoder’s voice activity detection. Research by Pelaez-Moreno et al. [18] and Aggarwal et al. [1] has focused on speech recognition from compressed VoIP. In earlier work, we showed that it is possible to identify the language spoken in a VoIP conversation using only the sizes of the encrypted packets [41].

Additionally, there is a growing body of work on inferring sensitive information from encrypted network connections using packet sizes and timing information. Sun et al. [32] demonstrated that it is possible to identify web pages traversing encrypted HTTP connections (e.g., SSL) using only the number and size of the encrypted HTTP responses. Saponas et al. [26] proposed a method to identify videos played over an encrypted network channel using the total size of the packets transmitted in a short window of time. Packet inter-arrival times have been used to infer keystrokes within encrypted SSH sessions [31].

### Conclusion
Previous research has shown that combining Variable Bit Rate (VBR) compression with length-preserving encryption leaks information about VoIP conversations [41]. In this paper, we demonstrate that this information leakage is far more severe than previously thought. Our results indicate that a profile hidden Markov model trained using speaker- and phrase-independent data can detect the presence of certain phrases within encrypted VoIP calls with recall and precision exceeding 90%. On average, our method achieves a recall of 50% and a precision of 51% for a wide variety of phonetically rich phrases spoken by a diverse group of speakers. We also examine the impact of noise, dictionary size, and word variation on the performance of our techniques.

Our study shows that an attacker can spot a variety of phrases in realistic settings, highlighting the danger of using the default encryption transforms of the SRTP protocol, none of which specify the use of padding [2]. Although padding could introduce inefficiencies into real-time protocols, our analysis indicates that it offers significant confidentiality benefits for VoIP calls. Future work should focus on developing padding techniques that balance efficiency and security.
