### 1980 Pennsylvania Lottery Scandal
On April 24, 1980, the lottery reached its liability limits on the Daily Number (3-digit game) for 8 combinations of 6s and 4s. The winning number was 666. Rumors surfaced that illegal bookmakers were not paying out. Slow-motion analysis revealed that only the 4s and 6s moved, while the other balls were weighted.

### Ron Harris Attacks Against Slots and Keno
Ronald Dale Harris, a computer programmer for the Nevada Gaming Control Board, exploited his access to source code to modify slot machines. He coded a hidden switch triggered by a specific sequence of coins, which paid out large sums. After retooling over 30 machines, Harris and his accomplices made significant gains. He later targeted Keno, developing a program to predict pseudorandom numbers. His accomplice, Reid Errol McNeal, was caught, leading to Harris's arrest and a seven-year prison sentence.
