# Denial of Service (DoS) Mitigation Testing: Version 3.0

**DEFCON 10, August 2002**

## Agenda
- **Why Test?**
- **Methodology**
- **Challenges and Lessons Learned**
- **Findings**

## Why Test?
### Objectives:
- **Protect Infrastructure, Data, and Business Continuity**: Ensuring the availability and integrity of critical systems.
- **Evaluate Emerging Technologies**: Assessing new tools and solutions to combat DoS attacks.
- **Address Growing Threats**: The proliferation of malicious DoS and DDoS tools in the wild.

### 2001 Survey Results
- **Increase in DoS Attacks**: According to the 2001 Information Security Magazine Industry Survey, there was a significant rise in DoS attacks experienced by participants.
  - **System Unavailability**: Ranked as the 4th highest information security concern.
  - **Website Security and Availability**: Listed as the 2nd most important project.
  - **Source**: Information Security Magazine, 2001 Industry Survey, October 2001, pg 34-47.

## What We Were Looking For
### Infrastructure Protection
- **Minimum Gigabit Solutions**: GigE and Fiber.
- **Desired Capabilities**: OC48 and OC192.

### Customer Protection
- **Gigabit MM Fiber, GigE, 10/100 Ethernet**: With future plans for OC48 and OC192.

## Products Tested
### Passive “Tapped” Solutions
- **Arbor Networks**
- **Reactive Networks**
- **Mazu Networks**
- **Asta Networks**

### In-Line Solutions
- **Captus Networks**
- **Mazu Networks**

### Basis of Selection
- Based on the September 2001 Information Security Magazine article, "Denying Denial-of-Service."

## Methodology
### Current DoS Prevention Techniques
- **Reverse Path Filtering**: Deny invalid IPs.
- **Ingress and Egress Filtering**: Allow only valid traffic in and out of the network.
- **Stop Directed Broadcast Traffic**: Prevent being an amplifier.

### Testing Approach
- **Simulate a Customer Hosting Center**: Run real tests across the infrastructure.
- **Test Network Functionality and Management Interfaces**: Ensure both are robust.
- **Upstream Solutions**: Focus on solutions that work upstream rather than downstream.

### Test Environment Architecture
- **Passive “Tapped” Testing**:
  - No network side IP address.
  - Data mirroring.
  - Not a single point of failure.
  - ACL recommendations for routers (Automatic, Semi-Automatic, Report Only).

- **In-Line Testing**:
  - Boxes placed in the data stream.
  - Quicker response to attacks based on implemented rules.
  - Interfaces visible on the network.

### Types of Tests
- **Baseline Traffic Generation**: Emulate a web hosting center using ldgen with replayed traffic.
- **Attack Traffic**:
  - TCP SYN, TCP ACK, UDP, ICMP, TCP floods.
  - Fragmented packets, IGMP flood.
  - Spoofed and un-spoofed attacks.

## Lessons Learned
### Network
- **Stateful Baseline Traffic**: Complete TCP 3-way handshake.

### Routes
- **Bad Routes**: Can severely impact the network. Ensure isolation of management networks from attack networks on every box.

### Attack Network
- **Diverse Tools and Systems**: Linux 6.2, Linux 7.2, Open BSD, Solaris.
- **Mixed Interfaces**: 10/100 and Gig interfaces to push traffic levels.

### Tools Utilized
- **DOS/DDOS Tools**: Vendor-provided, Arbor TrafGen, open-source (stream, litestorm, rc8.o, f__kscript, slice3).

### Victim Network
- **Monitoring Tools**: Lebrea, Snort.
- **Manual Checks**: Simple pings, CPU usage monitoring.

### Flow Sampling
- **Netflow/Cflowd from Cisco and Juniper**: Consistent sampling rates required.
- **Value Adds**: Traffic characterization, customer billing, and DOS/DDOS detection.

### SNMP Communications
- **SNMP for Monitoring**: Alerts when an attack is underway.
- **Connectivity and Community Stream**: Necessary for proper operation (NOT PUBLIC).

## Findings
### Strengths
- **Baseline Traffic Monitoring**: Detect changes and alert on threshold exceedance.

### Weaknesses
- **Management Interface Protection**: Lack of warning banners, account lockouts, and port lockdowns.

### Solutions
- **Large Enterprise**:
  - **Passive Solutions**: Mix of flow collectors and packet collectors.
  - **Centralized Management**: Security operations center or NOC.
  - **Products**: Arbor, Asta, Reactive.

- **Smaller Enterprise**:
  - **In-Line Solutions**: Combination firewall/DoS, IDS/DoS solutions.
  - **Products**: Captus, Mazu, Recourse (not tested).
