### New RIPE RIR Entries and IPv4 Block Hijacking

New entries in the RIPE RIR database listed AS19529 as the origin of IPv4 blocks that were actually owned by a different institution and registered in the ARIN region. The legitimate owner of these prefixes raised concerns on a RIPE forum, stating that the RIPE RIR records were incorrect and that their address blocks had been hijacked [20]. These complaints continued until April 2018, but the outcome remains unclear. According to our data, AS19529 ceased originating prefixes in July 2018. In its last nine months of activity, it originated a total of 63 different prefixes, 20 of which were MOAS (Multiple Origin AS) cases.

### Profiling BGP Serial Hijackers
IMC ’19, October 21–23, 2019, Amsterdam, Netherlands

### 8.3 An Ongoing Potential Hijacker

AS134190 first appeared in our data on July 14, 2016, originating only a single prefix for about a month before disappearing from the global routing table. In early 2017, AS134190 began repeatedly originating different prefixes for very short periods (about a day). Starting in July 2017, AS134190 occasionally originated a few prefixes, with some bursts of activity reaching over 30 simultaneously originated prefixes. During this period, AS134190 averaged almost 10 changes per day in terms of originated prefixes. In November 2018, BGPmon, a widely known BGP hijack detection system [2], detected a potential hijack from AS134190, followed by 10 additional potential hijacks in early 2019. As of today, we have not found further public complaints about potential hijacks carried out by AS134190.

### 9. Discussion

Our study was motivated by repeated complaints in the operational community about persistent prefix hijacking activities by certain ASes. On one hand, BGP's lack of validation mechanisms makes it vulnerable to both one-off and routine forms of abuse. On the other hand, BGP's transparency, combined with the availability of pervasive and public BGP measurement infrastructure (e.g., RouteViews, RIPE RIS), provides an opportunity to uncover systematic malicious behavior through automated methods.

In this work, we analyzed the origination behavior of a small set of manually identified serial hijacker ASes, finding distinct patterns that separate them from benign ASes. Despite limited ground truth and severe class imbalance, we trained a machine-learning classifier that effectively narrows our focus to a set of networks exhibiting similar behavior to serial hijackers. This set accounts for 5.5% (≈ 900) of the examined ASes, or 1.4% of all ASes visible in IPv4 BGP. Our analysis also reveals clear potential and specific directions to further reduce this set, enabling fully automated detection approaches and scoring systems in the future.

#### Practical Relevance

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work examining the BGP origination behavior of serial hijackers, a category that has received surprisingly little attention in terms of broad and detailed empirical assessment. We argue that serial hijacking behavior needs attention from both operators and the broader research community to allow for faster mitigation or even prevention of hijacking events.

While not all ASes flagged by our classifier are serial hijackers, all such networks do show highly distinctive origination patterns. Scrutinizing these networks, we found widespread indications of malicious behavior, with flagged ASes more likely to be in blacklists associated with malicious behavior and different indicators of misconfiguration. Since our system is orthogonal to commonly deployed reputation systems (e.g., event-based hijack detection) and works out-of-the-box using readily available public BGP data, we believe that, after refinement, the output of our classifier might be used to provide additional scoring data, e.g., in scoring-based reputation systems.

Even after disclosure, hijack reports and discussions on mailing lists typically focus on isolated incidents (i.e., usually the prefixes of the network operator issuing the complaint). The case of Bitcanal shows that it took years to effectively cap hijacking activity and disconnect Bitcanal. Our metrics can compactly and comprehensively capture the dominant origination characteristics of misbehaving networks. Thus, even after initial disclosure on mailing lists, our metrics and analysis provide an instant picture of the Internet-wide "state-of-affairs" of the networks in question, which can help operators to assess the full extent of hijacking activity and inform the process of coordinated mitigation.

#### Limitations

We note that our classifier is solely based on the routing activity of ASes and focuses on identifying routing characteristics of serial hijackers, which present one particular case of hijacking activity. Our detection mechanism does not cover the entire space of hijacking activity. While we find that serial hijackers do show distinct announcement patterns, our classifier falsely tags some legitimate ASes as having BGP behavior similar to serial hijackers, as reflected in the precision of our classifier of ≈ 80%. Therefore, while effective in narrowing down the set of flagged ASes to ≈ 900 ASes, our classifier should not be deployed, as is, to generate filtering rules. Additionally, if deployed in the future, there is a potential risk that hijackers could craft their BGP announcements to evade detection. Another limitation is that we focus solely on BGP origination patterns and therefore on BGP origin hijacks, not capturing hijacks that modify the AS path while leaving the legitimate origin AS unaltered. Our work constitutes an initial view into the properties of serial hijackers, with much future work to be done.

#### Future Work

In the future, we plan to extend the features we leverage for classification. Potential additional features include more BGP-derived properties, such as AS-path characteristics of hijacked prefixes, as well as sub- and super-MOAS events. We believe that such features could not only further improve separation of ASes but also shed light on topological properties of hijackers, e.g., upstream networks and peering facilities leveraged by serial hijackers. We further plan to cross-evaluate our findings with other external datasets. In a first step, we correlated our identified ASes against blacklists, finding indications of persistent malicious behavior. Our work is based on five years of historic BGP routing data, and we point out that some of the dominant characteristics of serial hijackers only become visible when studying routing data at longer timescales. However, our features to capture advertisement volatility are computed over much shorter timescales (i.e., bins of weeks and months), and our address space features might yield distinctive results when applied to shorter timescales. This suggests that early detection of systematic misbehavior might indeed be possible. We plan to further study the time-sensitivity of our approach to assess closer-to-real-time detection possibilities.
