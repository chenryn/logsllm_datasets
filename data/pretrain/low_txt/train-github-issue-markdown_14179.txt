I have developed a project for Webpack 4, which I have tested exclusively in web browsers. This project includes a small boilerplate that integrates the source code of Next.js without using Babel. Key features include:

- Hot-reloading for CSS and JavaScript
- Full functionality with Webpack 4

To make everything work seamlessly, I made some modifications to the core of Next.js.

For more details, please visit the GitHub repository: [NextJs4Reloaded](https://github.com/simonjoom/NextJs4Reloaded)

You can find a list of tested features in the repository's documentation:

Feel free to ask any questions you may have.
