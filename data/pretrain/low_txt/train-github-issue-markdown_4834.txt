It would be beneficial to have the Canny edge detector available in `scipy.ndimage`. Currently, implementations of the Canny edge detector can be found in:

- `cv2` (OpenCV): [Source Code](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/modules/imgproc/src/canny.cpp)
- `scikit-image`: [Source Code](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/blob/master/skimage/feature/_canny.py)

Could one of these implementations be adapted and integrated into `scipy.ndimage`?
