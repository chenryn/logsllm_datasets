### RISK RESPONSE DECISION

**TASK 3-3: Decide on the Appropriate Course of Action for Responding to Risk**

According to [NIST SP 800-39], organizations should select, tailor, and finalize Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) controls based on an evaluation of alternatives and a comprehensive understanding of threats, risks, and supply chain priorities. 

- **Level 1 and Level 2**: The resulting decision and the selected and tailored common control baselines (i.e., revisions to established baselines) should be documented within a C-SCRM-specific Risk Response Framework.
- **Level 3**: The resulting decision and the selected and tailored controls should be documented within the C-SCRM plan as part of an authorization package.

Risk response decisions may be made by a risk executive or delegated to other personnel within the organization. The significance and reach of the impact should determine the level at which the decision is made. These decisions are often made in collaboration with the organization’s risk executives, mission owners, and system owners, as appropriate. They are heavily influenced by the organization’s predetermined risk appetite and tolerance. Robust definitions of risk appetite and tolerance enable consistent alignment of risk decisions with strategic imperatives and can facilitate the delegation of risk decision responsibility to lower levels of the organization, providing greater autonomy.

**Documentation Requirements:**
- **Level 1 and Level 2**: Decisions should be documented with any changes to requirements or selected common control baselines (i.e., enterprise or mission and business process level) within C-SCRM-specific Risk Response Frameworks.
- **Level 3**: Decisions and selected controls should be documented in a C-SCRM plan, which should cover the full System Development Life Cycle (SDLC), document a C-SCRM baseline, and identify cybersecurity supply chain requirements and controls at the operational level. The C-SCRM plan should be revised and updated based on the output of cybersecurity supply chain monitoring.

**Key Components of a C-SCRM Plan:**
- Summary of the environment, including applicable policies, processes, and procedures.
- Identification of the role responsible for the plan (e.g., Risk Executive, CFO, CIO).
- Key contributors (e.g., CFO, COO, acquisition/contracting, procurement, C-SCRM PMO).
- Set of risk mitigation measures and controls resulting from the evaluation of alternatives.
- Tailoring decisions for selected controls, including the rationale.
- Feedback processes among the levels to ensure interdependencies are addressed.
- Monitoring and enforcement activities, including auditing if appropriate.
- Qualitative or quantitative measures to support the implementation and assess effectiveness.
- Frequency for reviewing and revising the plan.
- Criteria that would trigger revision, such as life cycle milestones or significant contracting activities.
- Inclusion of suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers in C-SCRM plans, if they are part of agreements.

**Integration and Interconnection:**
- Agencies may integrate C-SCRM controls into system security plans or develop separate operational-level C-SCRM plans.
- At Level 3, the C-SCRM plan applies to high- and moderate-impact systems, per [FIPS 199].
- Requirements and inputs from the enterprise C-SCRM strategy at Level 1 and the mission C-SCRM strategy and implementation plan at Level 2 should flow down to guide the development of C-SCRM plans at Level 3.
- Conversely, C-SCRM controls and requirements at Level 3 should be considered when developing and revising the requirements and controls applied at higher levels.
- C-SCRM plans should be interconnected and reference each other as appropriate.

**Table G-9: Controls at Levels 1, 2, and 3**

| Level | Controls | Examples |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Level 1** | Provides enterprise common control baselines to Level 2 and Level 3 | - Minimum sets of controls applicable to all suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers<br>- Enterprise-level controls for processing and storing supplier, developer, system integrator, external system service provider, and other ICT/OT-related service provider information<br>- Cybersecurity supply chain training and awareness for acquirer staff at the enterprise level |
| **Level 2** | - Inherits common controls from Level 1<br>- Provides mission and business process-level common controls baseline to Level 3<br>- Provides feedback to Level 1 about what is working and what needs to be changed | - Minimum sets of controls applicable to suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers for the specific mission and business process<br>- Program-level refinement of Identity and Access Management controls to address C-SCRM concerns<br>- Program-specific supply chain training and awareness |
| **Level 3** | - Inherits common controls from Level 1 and Level 2<br>- Provides system-specific controls for Level 3<br>- Provides feedback to Level 1 and Level 2 about what is working and what needs to be changed | - Minimum sets of controls applicable to service providers or specific hardware and software for the individual system<br>- Appropriately rigorous acceptance criteria for change management for systems that support the supply chain (e.g., testing or integrated development environments)<br>- System-specific cybersecurity supply chain training and awareness<br>- Intersections with the SDLC |

### RISK RESPONSE IMPLEMENTATION

**TASK 3-4: Implement the Course of Action Selected to Respond to Risk**

Organizations should implement the C-SCRM plan in a manner that integrates the C-SCRM controls into the overall agency risk management processes.

**Outputs and Post Conditions:**
- A set of C-SCRM controls that address C-SCRM requirements and can be incorporated into the system requirements baseline and agreements with third-party providers.
- These requirements and resulting controls will be incorporated into the SDLC and other enterprise processes throughout the three levels.

**For General Risk Types:**
- Selected, evaluated, and tailored C-SCRM controls that address identified risks.
- Identified consequences of accepting or not accepting the proposed mitigations.
- Development and implementation of the C-SCRM plan.

### MONITOR

**INPUTS AND PRECONDITIONS**

The Monitor step involves verifying compliance, determining the ongoing effectiveness of risk response measures, and identifying risk-impacting changes to enterprise information systems and environments of operation. Changes to the enterprise, mission and business processes, operations, or the supply chain can directly impact the organization’s cybersecurity supply chain. The Monitor step provides a mechanism for tracking such changes and ensuring they are appropriately assessed for impact (in the Assess step).

**Examples of Supply Chain Risk Events:**
- Change of ownership, merger, or acquisition
- Disruption to the supply chain
- Continuity or emergency event affecting a source or its supply chain
- Ransomware or other cybersecurity attack affecting a source or its supply chain
- New information about a critical vulnerability
- Discovery of counterfeit or non-conforming products or components
- Change in location for manufacturing or software development
- OEM no longer producing or supporting a product or critical component
- Evidence of non-disclosed functionality or features
- Notification requiring additional investigation
- Presence of covered articles produced by a prohibited or non-authorized source
- Evidence of suspicious Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI)
- Other changes that may negatively affect the risk profile

**Integration with Continuous Monitoring:**
- Organizations should integrate C-SCRM into existing continuous monitoring programs. If a continuous monitoring program does not exist, C-SCRM can serve as a catalyst for establishing one.
