### Payment for Certificates

Even for smaller operators, the absence of fees is a significant enabler. It allows for an initial setup without the need to arrange payment and enables a "fire and forget" configuration, eliminating concerns about credit card validity and potential reissuance failures.

### Gradual Deployment

Gradual deployment is crucial. While Let’s Encrypt is not the only initiative to provide universal free server authentication, it has seen the most widespread adoption. Other efforts include DNS Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) [19], Sovereign Keys [39], and MonkeySphere [70]. For instance, the DNSSEC root zone was signed in 2010, and DANE was published in 2012—three years before Let’s Encrypt launched. However, there is virtually no server deployment, and no major web client supports DANE.

The primary issue with DANE, as hinted by the lack of major web client support, is that for servers to use DANE, clients must first adopt it. Conversely, without any servers using DANE, clients have no incentive to support it. This chicken-and-egg problem also applies to Sovereign Keys and other alternative proposals for web server authentication.

In contrast, Let’s Encrypt issued standard Web PKI certificates that, thanks to cross-signatures, were immediately valid in almost any browser. This allowed for rapid deployment without requiring changes on both the server and client sides.

### Lessons for Future Technologies

The application of blockchain technologies for cryptocurrency has led to proposals for rooting identity in a blockchain, enabling direct verification of ownership without third-party validation. However, such systems would require all clients to change, and until that happens, servers would still need traditional Web PKI certificates. Historical evidence suggests that this chicken-and-egg problem will likely stall deployment. A potential solution could be to issue Web PKI certificates with proofs of ownership rooted in the blockchain-based identity system. This would allow all clients to communicate with those servers while enabling clients and Certificate Transparency monitors to validate the proper issuance of certificates and report any misissuances.

### Remaining Security Concerns

While Let’s Encrypt has increased HTTPS deployment, it has not significantly enhanced the security of the Web PKI. Key security challenges remain, including the fact that domain validation is not as secure as desired. Additionally, there is ongoing debate about whether Let’s Encrypt has had a negative impact on some aspects of Web PKI security.

Automation has improved but not solved validation. Although a fully-automated validation process has reduced human errors, it is not foolproof. 

### Domain Validation Security

One major security objective not yet achieved with Let’s Encrypt is strong protection against DNS- and routing-layer attacks. An attacker who can use DNS or BGP hijacking to redirect traffic—or compromise a network device near the server or CA—can intercept domain validation traffic and falsely request a certificate [26, 52, 84]. Domain owners can mitigate these risks by limiting the CAs that can issue for them using CAA [49], and vigilant operators can use CT monitors (e.g., [41]) to detect false issuances and respond.

Let’s Encrypt is experimenting with multiple perspective validation, where control of the domain is verified from multiple vantage points in different autonomous systems. A strong majority of these verifications must succeed for the certificate to be issued.

Unfortunately, these measures cannot protect against all validation attacks. The fundamental issue is that domain validation itself is not cryptographically protected, as it is the bootstrapping mechanism for sites joining the PKI. After a domain has been validated once, it might seem sensible to disable future non-cryptographic validation methods, but this risks downtime if sites lose their validation keys or if attackers take over a domain temporarily.

### Phishing and Malware

Phishing remains a challenge for the web. A common complaint about Let’s Encrypt is its use in phishing attacks. By some measures, more than half of phishing sites now use HTTPS, and many of these sites use certificates issued by Let’s Encrypt [34]. Some observers have called for CAs to take a more active role in combating such sites. However, CAs are not well-positioned to detect phishing and malware, as they do not have sufficient visibility into sites’ content, which can change rapidly.

Attempts to limit certificates to domains with entirely safe content are problematic. Some sites may be denied service due to false positives or questionable definitions of safe content. Moreover, CAs can only deny service to entire domains, which could result in major global news sites losing their certificates due to a single malicious ad. Finer-grained mechanisms for protecting users are needed.

Let’s Encrypt once checked Google’s Safe Browsing API before issuing certificates but stopped due to these reasons. Browsers and search engines, with greater content awareness, can protect users at the page level. For example, Google Safe Browsing [89] uses machine learning to continuously detect malicious content and warn Chrome users.

### Conclusion

Widespread HTTPS deployment has enabled browsers to change their security indicator UIs, reducing user confusion. Instead of showing a positive security indicator for HTTPS, browsers like Chrome and Firefox now show negative indicators for HTTP sites [83], further encouraging HTTPS adoption.
