## Motivation
The primary objectives of this study are:
- To conduct a comprehensive survey of existing and potential attack behaviors on social networking sites.
- To identify patterns in such attack behaviors.
- To detect spammers in real-world social networks.
- To review existing solutions, measurement techniques, and defense mechanisms.

## Definition of Spam
According to Merriam-Webster Online, spam is defined as "unsolicited, usually commercial, email sent to a large number of addresses." With the evolution of the internet, spam has expanded to include various forms of unwanted content in internet-enabled applications, such as email, web, and social media. The broader definition includes any activity that unjustifiably captures user attention in these applications.

### Types of Internet Spam
- **Direct Spam:**
  - Email Spam
  - Instant Messaging Spam (SPIM)
  - Social Network Spam
  - Spam Blogs (Splogs)
  - General Web Spam
- **Indirect Spam:**
  - Social Media Spam
  - Spamdexing

### Mechanisms of Spam
- Auto-generated and/or Plagiarized Content
- Advertisements in Profitable Contexts
- Link Farms to Promote Other Spam Pages

## Popular Social Networks
Sites like Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter consistently rank among the top 20 most-viewed websites on the internet. In 2008, 83% of social network users reported receiving at least one unwanted friend request or message. A previous study found that 45% of users on a social networking site would click on links posted by their "friends," even if they did not know them in real life.

### Facebook
- Facebook claims to have over 400 million active users globally.
- Users are grouped into networks based on geographic location, school, or workplace.
- Default privacy settings allowed all members within the same network to view each other's profiles.
- In October 2009, Facebook deprecated geographic networks.

### Twitter
- Designed as a microblogging platform where users send short text messages (tweets) that appear on their followers' pages.
- Users are identified by a username and, optionally, a real name.
- Tweets can be grouped by hashtags, which are popular words prefixed with a "#" character, allowing users to search for topics of interest.

## Data Collection
To gather data, 900 honey-profiles were created across Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter (300 on each platform). These accounts, similar to honeypots, were designed to detect and counteract unauthorized use of information systems.

### Data Collection Methods
- **Facebook:**
  - Joined 16 geographic networks using a small number of manually-created accounts.
  - Crawled 2,000 random accounts, logging names, ages, and genders.
  - Created honey-profiles by randomly mixing this data.
- **MySpace:**
  - Crawled 4,000 accounts in total.
- **Twitter:**
  - Required only a full name and profile name for sign-up.

### Data Logging
- No friend requests were sent, but all received requests were accepted.
- Logged all email notifications and requests/messages seen on the honey-profiles.
- Scripts ran continuously for 12 months on Facebook and 11 months on MySpace and Twitter.

## Analysis of Collected Data
Honey-profiles received friend requests and messages from both spammers and legitimate accounts. Many social network users aim to increase their popularity by adding unknown people as friends, especially in geographic networks.

### Types of Bots
- **Displayer:**
  - Bots that display spam content on their own profile pages.
  - All detected MySpace bots belonged to this category.
- **Bragger:**
  - Bots that post messages to their own feed.
  - Messages vary by network (e.g., status updates on Facebook, tweets on Twitter).
  - 163 Facebook bots and 341 Twitter bots belonged to this category.
- **Poster:**
  - Bots that send direct messages to victims.
  - Most effective way of spamming, reaching a greater number of users.
  - Eight Facebook bots were detected in this category.
- **Whisperer:**
  - Bots that send private messages to specific users.
  - Common on Twitter, where spam bots send direct messages to their victims.

### Bot Behavior
- **Greedy:**
  - Include spam content in every message (416 bots).
- **Stealthy:**
  - Send legitimate-looking messages, occasionally injecting malicious content (98 bots).

## Detection Techniques
Machine learning techniques were used to classify spammers and legitimate users. Six features were developed to detect whether a profile belongs to a spammer:

1. **Friend-Follower Ratio (R):**
   - R = following / followers (only applicable on Twitter).
2. **URL Ratio (U):**
   - U = (messages containing URLs / total messages).
3. **Message Similarity (S):**
   - Measures the similarity between messages.
4. **Friend Choice (F):**
   - Analyzes the choice of friends.
5. **Messages Sent (M):**
   - Number of messages sent.
6. **Friend Number (FN):**
   - Number of friends.

### Classifier
- The Weka framework with a Random Forest algorithm was used for classification.

### Challenges
- Obtaining a suitable amount of data for analysis.
- Most profiles are private, and only friends can see their walls.
- Geographic networks were discontinued in October 2009.

### Results
- **Facebook:**
  - Trained classifier using 1,000 profiles (173 spam bots and 827 manually checked profiles).
  - Detected 130 spammers with 7 false positives.
- **Twitter:**
  - Easier to obtain data as most profiles are public.
  - Modified R feature to R' = (R value) / (number of followers).
  - Crawl speed limited to 20,000 API calls per hour.
  - Detected 15,932 spammers with 75 false positives.

## Conclusion
Social networking sites attract spammers due to the ease of reaching users and the potential to exploit profile information. By creating honey-profiles and observing the traffic, we developed techniques to identify single spam bots and large-scale campaigns. These techniques can help social networks improve their security and detect malicious users.
