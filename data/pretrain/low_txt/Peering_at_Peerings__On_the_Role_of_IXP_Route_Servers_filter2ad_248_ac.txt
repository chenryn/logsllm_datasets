# Peerings and Traffic Analysis at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs)

## 5. From Connectivity to Traffic

In this section, we investigate how many of the established peerings reported in Table 2 are actually used, i.e., carry traffic. Additionally, we examine the distribution of traffic based on the type of peering link.

### 5.1 Identifying Traffic-Carrying Peerings

To identify a traffic-carrying peering between AS X and AS Y, we analyze sFlow records that:
- Contain MAC addresses belonging to AS X and AS Y, respectively.
- Have IP addresses not part of the IXP's assigned IP address space.

This method allows us to distinguish between control traffic (BGP sessions) and actual data traffic, thereby identifying BL peerings with and without traffic. For a small portion of the traffic (less than 0.5% for both IXPs), we did not find a corresponding BL or ML peering link, and this traffic is excluded from our analysis.

For IXP member ASes that peer both bilaterally and multilaterally, we assume that the observed traffic traverses the BL peering link. This assumption is based on the observation that establishing a BL peering requires more effort (e.g., manually setting up BGP sessions) and indicates joint incentives between the parties. In contrast, ML peering via the RS is designed to be easy and informal, allowing immediate traffic exchange with all RS peers.

Empirical support for this approach comes from manual searches of LGs that query the routing tables of member routers. In all six cases, advertisements via BL sessions were selected as the best path over those from the RS, typically by setting a higher local preference for routes received via BL sessions.

### 5.2 Traffic Over ML and BL Peerings

The results of our analysis of traffic-carrying links are summarized in Table 3. Comparing Table 2 and Table 3, we observe that more than 80% of the peering links at both IXPs carry traffic. The ratio of traffic-carrying peerings is highest for BL peerings, followed by symmetric ML peerings, and then asymmetric ML peerings.

When we consider the top 99.9% of the IXP's total traffic, the number of active peerings significantly decreases. This thresholding exercise highlights that while RSes increase connectivity and account for a large number of peerings, most ML peerings carry only a small amount of traffic. Conversely, the smaller number of BL peerings carries the bulk of the traffic.

We also note that IPv6 peerings, although numerous, carry very little significant traffic (less than 1% at each IXP). Therefore, for the remainder of this paper, we focus on IPv4 traffic.

To assess the overall contribution of BL and ML peerings, we mapped the total traffic of the L-IXP and M-IXP onto the BL and ML peerings. Figure 5(a) shows a time series of the traffic on BL and ML peerings over a one-week period. At L-IXP, despite fewer BL peerings, the total BL traffic is more than twice the ML traffic. At M-IXP, the BL:ML traffic ratio is closer to 1:1.

Figure 5(b) presents a CCDF of the traffic distribution over BL/ML peerings. The top traffic-contributing peerings show similar contributions from BL and ML peerings. Notably, the top traffic-contributing peering at both IXPs is an ML peering, underscoring the critical role of IXP RSes in todayâ€™s Internet.

### Summary

While most peerings at our IXPs (about 80%) do carry traffic, BL peerings are more likely to carry significant traffic compared to ML peerings. When considering traffic volumes, the small number of BL peerings dominates the large number of ML peerings, with observed traffic ratios of 2:1 (L-IXP) and 1:1 (M-IXP). Thus, the majority of ML peerings carry only small amounts of traffic, but some of the top traffic-contributing links at both IXPs are ML peerings.

## 6. From Traffic to Routes: Prefixes

In this section, we move beyond the link perspective of peerings and peering traffic to examine peerings at the level of routed prefixes. This new perspective helps us understand peering opportunities at IXPs and the different peering options chosen by member ASes.

### 6.1 A Prefix View of Peering

The popularity of the RS service at the L-IXP and M-IXP is evident from the large number of ML peerings. To understand the benefits a new member AS can gain by connecting to the IXP's RS, we analyzed each prefix advertised via the RS and counted how many of the RS's peers receive it.

Figure 6(a) shows a histogram (y-axis in log-scale) revealing a bimodal distribution: either a prefix is exported to almost all members or to only a few. The mode to the right indicates that a sizable fraction of prefixes is exported to almost all member ASes, reflecting the peering-friendly policies at the IXP. A new IXP member connected to the RS will receive more than 65K routes from about 11K origin ASes at the L-IXP and more than 12.5K routes from about 3K origin ASes at the M-IXP (see Table 4).

The mode to the left in Figure 6(a) shows a sizable fraction of prefixes exported to fewer than 10% of the RS's peers, indicating the effectiveness of the IXP's strategy to restrict the propagation of certain routes to certain members.
