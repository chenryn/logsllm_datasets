### Problem Description
I am looking to set my preload script directly inline in the `webPreferences` of `main.js`. I found two pull requests, #27741 and #27546, which seem to address this feature. However, these threads do not provide updated information on when this feature will be released or the syntax to use it.

Could you please confirm if this feature is currently available? If so, could you provide a short example of how to implement it?

**Environment:**
- Electron: 12.0.5
- Operating System: Windows x64
