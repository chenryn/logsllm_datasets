For instance, they merged a local chocolate maker's packaging project with storytelling, the creation of new rituals through making lanterns from recycled materials, an existing street music festival, and a forgotten neighborhood tradition. This amalgamation resulted in an annual pilgrimage of musicians, whose story is told on the packaging of the street chocolate, where the street lanterns are used. For more details, see:

A similar line of thought could be applied to professional designers, with the key difference being that design schools often have more freedom to experiment, can afford to fail, and can invest time and effort into researching and testing new forms of interaction among citizens, policymakers, and civil servants.

### INNOVATION WITHOUT BOUNDARIES:  
ECOLOGY OF INNOVATION AND MUNICIPAL SERVICE DESIGN
**Luigi Ferrara, Magdalena Sabat**

**ABSTRACT**
The Institute without Boundaries (IwB) has worked extensively with North American and international municipal governments. The Institute’s emphasis on design thinking and an ecology of innovation approach has enabled creative interventions and design solutions for the public service sector. This article describes the IwB’s latest collaborations: the COLAB project conducted with the City of Markham in 2011-2012 and the Dublin Project conducted with the Dublin City Council in 2012-2013. These partnerships have built bridges between municipal governments and citizens, producing tangible solutions to innovate public service delivery in both cities. They have also sparked and developed inter-organizational collaboration and co-creation, showing that forming global design-based networks is an important aspect of contemporary service design. The IwB’s ecology of innovation approach in the Markham and Dublin projects serves as a model for building and discovering new strategies to innovate public service.

**INTRODUCTION**
When discussing the intersection of design, social innovation, and public policy, the conversation often focuses on only one of these variables, highlighting the challenge of integrating all three. In the late 20th century, experts emphasized technological innovation as a connective and utopian force driving social change and economic opportunity. However, this approach has been critiqued as technological determinism, reducing complex environmental, spiritual, and social issues to matters of connectivity and access to new technology.

The potential of technological innovation has been reevaluated and redefined. Technology is increasingly seen as embedded in a system of processes that, when understood and translated, become socially useful. For example, at the Fifth European Academy of Design Conference in 2003, Hendrik Reynders emphasized, “Technology is not limited to the so-called hardware that we produce, but relates to the complete process of translating inventive scientific thinking into new processes and forms of production.” Thus, 'technology' is not a singular object but a process functioning within a web of social, political, and economic relationships.

An increasing number of politicians, business people, activists, and scholars are examining social innovation as an alternative tool to solve 'wicked' global challenges such as income distribution, resource depletion, overdevelopment, and environmental degradation. In these debates, social innovation is synonymous with tools, strategies, or relationships that enable social change. While social innovation is a welcome addition, promoting it as an end in itself could lead to similar short-sightedness in managing and promoting innovation. Innovation has its own ecology, comprising multiple factors that must harmonize before it can take root and have an effect.

**Figure 1. Ecology of Innovation Diagram**

There is no single ingredient that drives successful innovation. In "Systems Design: Working with Change" (2012), Nigel Snoad argues that innovation must account for the emerging interconnectedness and interdependence of complex systems focusing on users' functions—how we live today. He states, “We actually live in multiple communities at once: the places we work, the places we travel, where our parents live.” According to Snoad, addressing the complexity of our lives requires multi-directional and multi-faceted innovation.

The Institute without Boundaries (IwB) uses an ecology of innovation approach. Figure 1 shows the interconnectedness of political, social, design, technical, and business innovation. An ecology of innovation is an understanding that innovation is multi-directional and multi-faceted. The figure proposes that a constellation of balanced and aligned factors makes true and lasting innovation possible. While social innovation may help us determine how we might want to live differently, technological innovation can build platforms that allow for these new possibilities to operate; design innovation can contextualize those possibilities into formats we can understand and use; business innovation can render the formats replicable and propagate them in society; and political innovation can assist in institutionalizing innovation, creating a pervasive environment that guides and regulates how we live. As a conceptual method, an ecology of innovation is based on the proposition that all these forces interacting on a level plane are required to make social change. The method promotes a culture and attitude of change and experimentation, considering innovation as inclusive of tools, strategies, and the development of key relationships, recognizing that it is the synergy of these factors that enables social change.

Implementing an ecology of innovation in the public sector has different challenges than in the private sector. City bureaucracies have established speeds, processes, and budgets that can seem resistant to change. Municipal bodies have a metonymic relationship to the cities they represent and govern, and on a smaller scale, they represent the whole city structure. Differences in perspectives and approaches within the municipal government body make it difficult to address the whole organization and the whole city. When viewed as a constellation of factors and attitudes that accounts for the complexities of everyday life, innovation in public service is multi-dimensional and complex, but not impossible to manage and change.

The Institute without Boundaries has been working with municipal partners since its inception in 2003 as a collaborative studio environment and academic program seeking to achieve social, ecological, and economic innovation. In its most recent projects, it has worked with the City of Markham in Canada and the Dublin City Council in Ireland. Markham and Dublin are very different cities with different problems, but there are many similarities facing these municipal governments in terms of public service delivery, specifically how to channel new ideas into public service and build better relationships with citizens. The IwB’s ecology of innovation approach is an evolving method that can be used as a framework for service design. The work presented here not only showcases the innovative ideas created by the IwB students, staff, and project partners, but it also discusses the benefits for municipal governments of working with an interdisciplinary body like the IwB. The discussion below highlights the experience of collaboration from the perspectives of the municipal government, IwB staff, and students, showing that at its core, innovation is an ecology that requires the development of organizational relationships as much as it needs new research, tools, and strategies.

**Working with Cities: The IwB and its Partners**
The Institute without Boundaries (IwB) is located in Toronto. It was founded in 2003 by the School of Design at George Brown College, in consultation with Bruce Mau. It is a unique academic, research, and development program focused on collaborative design practice with the objectives of social, ecological, and economic innovation through design research and strategy. Central to this work are real projects of public and global significance executed by students, faculty, and industry experts as part of academic curriculum, research initiatives, and creative projects. The IwB has worked with several city entities, many non-profit organizations, and industry partners. Along with the Municipality of Markham, Ontario, and the Dublin City Council, some of the Institute’s past project partners include the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, the Ministry of Housing in Costa Rica, Habitat for Humanity Canada, Evergreen Canada, the Toronto Community Housing Corporation, and the Chilean City of Lota. These and other partnerships are part of the IwB’s research program, which has evolved since 2002 when the Institute began its first major project called Massive Change, a two-year initiative that examined the role of design in addressing social, environmental, and economic progress. Massive Change spurred World House, a four-year project between 2004-2008 that explored the design of shelter, advanced housing solutions that promote inclusion, sustainability, affordability, and technological and environmental responsiveness. From this initiative came the City Systems research project from 2009-2012, which looked at the evolution of resilient twenty-first-century models for large-scale social housing, towns rebuilding after natural and economic disasters, edge cities needing to become complete cities, layering and density in city centers, and the design of public service delivery.

The City Systems research focus was the framework for partnerships with the City of Markham and the Dublin City Council. It addressed the micro and macro levels of service provision within cities to understand the systems present in municipal governance and how an ecology of innovation can realign and make these systems more efficient. The work conducted shows that in a short time, municipal governments can reinvigorate their internal organizational communication, develop better communication with citizens, and generally add social and economic value to the municipality. The success of the projects has been largely due to the open attitude of municipal staff, a disposition that project participants have described as forward-thinking leadership able to understand and mediate the conditions for change. The IwB’s collaboration with Markham and Dublin has pinpointed opportunities for infrastructural and urban beautification, expansion of cultural programming, new efficiencies in public service communication, and proposals for innovation units within the municipality. The Markham and Dublin projects serve as models for new forms of collaboration and strategies for building strong partnerships to innovate public service delivery.

**COLAB: A Future Change Lab for Markham**
In 2011, during the third year of City Systems research, the City of Markham became a major sponsor and project partner of the Institute. The IwB spent nine months studying Markham, Ontario, exploring its municipal systems, and proposing design strategies and key interventions for Highway 7 and the other main streets of Markham. At the outskirts of Toronto, Markham is an 'edge city' in many respects, with homogeneous residential areas, large distances, and little density to promote pedestrian culture. However, it is also changing both spatially and demographically. Markham has an incredibly diverse and growing population of more than 300,000 citizens, over fifty percent of whom are Chinese and South Asian, and many of whom are new immigrants. The city holds a powerful position.
