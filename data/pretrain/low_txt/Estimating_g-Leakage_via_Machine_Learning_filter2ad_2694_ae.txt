### 6. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

We have proposed an approach to estimate the \(\delta\)-vulnerability of a system under the black-box assumption using machine learning. The core idea is to reduce the problem to learning the Bayes classifier on a set of pre-processed training data. We have introduced two techniques for this transformation, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Our approach has been evaluated in various scenarios, demonstrating favorable results. When compared to the frequentist approach, our method performs similarly on small observable domains but outperforms it on larger ones, consistent with findings in [14] for the estimation of the Bayes error.

For future work, we plan to test our framework in more real-life scenarios, such as web fingerprinting attacks [13, 15] and the AES cryptographic algorithm [22]. Additionally, we aim to consider the more general case, often encountered in Information-flow security, where channels have both "high" and "low" inputs, with the former being secrets and the latter being data visible to or controlled by the adversary. A more ambitious goal is to use our approach to minimize the \(\delta\)-vulnerability of complex systems using a GAN-based approach, following the lines of [33].

### A. AUXILIARY RESULTS

**Proposition A.1 (Bernstein’s Inequality)**  
Let \( Z_1, \ldots, Z_n \) be i.i.d. random variables such that \( Z \in [a, b] \) almost surely, and let \( S_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n Z_i - \mathbb{E}[Z] \) and \( v = \text{Var}(Z) \) be the variance of \( Z \). Then, for any \( \epsilon > 0 \), we have:
\[ \Pr(S_n \geq \epsilon) \leq \exp \left( - \frac{n \epsilon^2}{2v + \frac{2(b-a)\epsilon}{3}} \right) \]
Compared to Hoeffding’s inequality, it is easy to check that, for regimes where \( \epsilon \) is small, Bernstein’s inequality offers tighter bounds when \( v \ll (b - a)^2 \).

**Lemma A.2**  
Let \( \sigma^2 = \text{Var}(Z) \) and let \( Z \) be a real-valued random variable such that for all \( 0 < t \leq \sigma \):
\[ \int_0^\sigma P(Z \geq t) \, dt \leq \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \, \sigma \, \text{erf} \left( \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \]
where, for large \( x \),
\[ \text{erf}(x) \approx 1 - \frac{e^{-x^2}}{\sqrt{\pi} x} + O \left( \frac{1}{x^2} \right) \]

**Proof**  
\[
\int_0^\sigma P(Z \geq t) \, dt \leq \int_0^\sigma \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \, e^{-t^2/2} \, dt = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \, \sigma \, \text{erf} \left( \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{2}} \right)
\]
and eq. (38) follows from the Taylor’s expansion of the erf function. □

### B. PROOFS FOR THE STATISTICAL BOUNDS

**Lemma B.1**  
The following inequality holds:
\[
|V_\delta - V_m(f^*)| \leq 2 \max_{f \in \mathcal{H}} |V_m(f) - V(f)|
\]
**Proof**  
\[
|V_\delta - V_m(f^*)| = |V(f^*) - V_m(f^*)| \leq |V(f^*) - V_m(f^*)| + \max_{f \in \mathcal{H}} |V_m(f) - V(f)| \leq 2 \max_{f \in \mathcal{H}} |V_m(f) - V(f)|
\]
