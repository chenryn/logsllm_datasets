### Main Lemma

**Lemma 5.** Let \(\lambda = \text{poly}(\lambda)\) and \(D\) be a \(\lambda\)-useful decoder box. If \(\{I_j\}_{j \in [m]}\) is a dummy attribute set for the user, consider the following experiment:

1. **Random Selection:** Select a dummy attribute set \(\{J_j\}_{j \in [m]}\) at random such that \(|I_j \cap J_j| \leq \frac{\lambda}{24m}\).

In particular, the tracing algorithm will implicate the PKG (Private Key Generator) for all but a negligible fraction of choices of dummy attributes.

For the proof, we refer the reader to the full version [18].

### Proof by Contradiction

Equipped with this lemma, we continue our proof by contradiction. By Lemma 3, the view of the adversary after events \(E_2 \land E_3\) will be identical for all the remaining \((\delta/2) - \nu_3\) fraction of \(r_C\). Thus, the adversary creates this box independent of \(r_C\) other than the fact that \(E_2 \land E_3\) hold. Because any of these dummy attribute sets remain equally likely, the probability that \(D\) will succeed is at most:

\[
P[\text{SUCC}] \leq P[\text{SUCC} | E_1 \land E_2] = P[\text{SUCC} | E_1 \land E_2 \land E_3] \cdot P[E_3 | E_1 \land E_2] + P[\text{SUCC} | E_1 \land E_2 \land \neg E_3] \cdot P[\neg E_3 | E_1 \land E_2]
\]

\[
= \frac{\nu_4}{\delta} \cdot \left( \frac{\delta}{2} - \nu_3 \right) + 1 \cdot \nu_3 = \text{negl}(\lambda)
\]

### Theorem 3

**Theorem 3.** The advantage of an adversary in the Selective-ID DishonestUser game is negligible for the above A-IBE (Accountable Identity-Based Encryption) scheme under the decisional BDH (Bilinear Diffie-Hellman) assumption.

### Similarities and Adaptations

There are similarities between the Selective-ID DishonestUser game and the selective-set IND-ID-CCA (Indistinguishability under Chosen Ciphertext Attack) game of Goyal et al. [19]. With some critical modifications, one may adapt the proof of security in Goyal et al. [19] to show a direct reduction of the Selective-ID DishonestUser game to the decisional BDH assumption. Instead, we pinpoint these critical modifications by giving a reduction from the Selective-ID DishonestUser game to the selective-set IND-ID-CCA game of Goyal et al. [19].

### Proof Sketch

Assume towards a contradiction that there is an adversary \(A_0\) which wins the DishonestUser game with advantage \(\varepsilon\). As in Theorem 2, by the composition theorem of Canetti [10], there exists an adversary \(A\) which has advantage \(\text{Adv}\) in the OT-Hybrid model where the oblivious transfer in the key generation is replaced by an ideal functionality. This new advantage \(\text{Adv}\) only differs from \(\varepsilon\) by a negligible quantity. We use \(A\) to play against a selective-set ABE (Attribute-Based Encryption) challenger \(B\). Our construction is based on the Goyal et al. [19] scheme, so there is a one-to-one correspondence between the parameters in that scheme and the parameters in our scheme.

#### Detailed Reduction

- **Universe of Attributes:** Consider the universe of attributes to be of size \(2\ell + mn\). The \(2\ell\) attributes \((A_{1,0}, A_{1,1}, \ldots, A_{\ell,0}, A_{\ell,1})\) will be for the identity, and the remaining attributes will be for the dummy attributes.
- **Attribute Assignment:** In our scheme, a user will have \(\ell\) attributes corresponding to his identity (i.e., he will have \(A_{i, \text{ID}_i}\) if the \(i\)-th bit of his identity is \(\text{ID}_i\)) and \(k\) dummy attributes for each of the \(m\) repetitions. This choice of attributes naturally defines the associated policy, meaning a ciphertext can be decrypted only if the identity attributes match and there is at least a \(\tau\) number of attributes matching in each of the \(m\) repetitions.

### Reduction from DishonestUser to Selective-Set IND-ID-CCA

1. **Select ID:** The adversary \(A\) selects an ID\(^*\) as the challenge. We select the set of attributes corresponding to ID\(^*\) (namely, \(\{A_{i, \text{ID}_i^*}\}_{i=1}^\ell\)) and a random set of dummy attributes \(\{J_j^*\}_{j \in [m]}\) and send the union as the selected set to \(B\). These will be the attributes used in the challenge ciphertexts in the selective-set game we are playing with \(B\).
2. **Setup:** \(B\) sends us public parameters, which we pass on to \(A\).
3. **Key Generation Queries:**
   - If \(A\) queries for a key on ID \(\neq \text{ID}^*\), simply pass the corresponding user policy as a key query to \(B\), which returns a well-formed key that we pass back to \(A\).
   - If ID = ID\(^*\), since we know the private inputs, we may select permutations \(\pi_1, \ldots, \pi_m\) in a way such that the key received by \(A\) will not be able to decrypt a ciphertext containing our previously selected attributes. We then query \(B\) for this key and pass it back to \(A\). This deviation from the protocol does not affect \(A\)'s view due to symmetry.

4. **Create Decoder Box:** \(A\) now must output a decryption key \(d_{\text{ID}^*}\) and a decoder box \(D\). If \(A\) wins the DishonestUser game, the decoder box will implicate the PKG, which can only occur when there is a non-negligible probability that \(D\) decrypts a random ciphertext that cannot be decrypted by \(d_{\text{ID}^*}\). We randomly select two messages \(M_0, M_1\) and send them to \(B\), which then sends us a challenge ciphertext \(C\) under the previously selected set. If \(d_{\text{ID}^*}\) can decrypt this message, we immediately do so and send the correct guess to \(B\). On the other hand, if \(d_{\text{ID}^*}\) cannot decrypt, then \(C\) can be viewed as a random ciphertext that \(\text{ID}^*\) cannot decrypt, and therefore whenever \(A\) wins the DishonestUser game, \(D\) must have a non-negligible advantage in decrypting the ciphertext.

Thus, we have a non-negligible advantage in the selective-set game against \(B\). This contradicts the security of the ABE scheme under the decisional BDH assumption.

### Conclusion and Open Problems

In this paper, we proposed a model of a secure accountable authority IBE scheme that handles black-box decoders. This model is a critical improvement over the original Goyal [17] model. We gave a construction of an A-IBE scheme in this enhanced model under the decisional BDH assumption, where the security was with respect to the IND-ID-CPA, DishonestPKG, and Selective-ID DishonestUser games. It may be worth noting that the construction can be viewed as "attachable" to any IBE scheme by secret sharing the message, allowing for better security or a more efficient underlying scheme.

Several interesting open problems remain:
- **Full Security:** Prove the full security of the A-IBE scheme, not just in the Selective-ID DishonestUser game.
- **Multiple Decryption Keys:** Develop an A-IBE scheme that allows a single ID to generate polynomially many keys.
- **Tracing Algorithm:** Improve the tracing algorithm to work with only a public tracing key or with the assistance of a tracing authority.
- **Efficiency:** Enhance the efficiency of the scheme, possibly by introducing a second parameter \(\gamma\) to determine the level of accountability, allowing for logarithmic or constant-sized decryption keys and ciphertexts.

### Appendix

**A. An Instantiation of the Parameters**

We give an explicit example of how to choose appropriate key sizes and threshold sizes for decryption. For simplicity, we will focus on one component, i.e., we set \(j = 1\) when looking at \(I_j\) in the decryption key and \(J_j\) in the ciphertext. Each of these sets is of size \(k\), which we choose to be a fixed constant fraction of \(n\). For example, we may choose \(k = \frac{3}{5} n\). From this, we can determine the expected number of dummy attributes in their intersection: \(\frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{3}{5} \cdot n = \frac{9}{25} n\).

By Chernoff bounds, it can be seen that the probability that this intersection falls below a constant fraction of \(\frac{9}{25} n\) will be negligible in \(n\). Thus, if we set our threshold to be \(\frac{7}{25} n\), a random ciphertext can be decrypted by the user except with negligible probability.
