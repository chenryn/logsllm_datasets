# Evaluation of VoIP Quality over WiBro

## 4.2 VoIP Traffic Analysis

For the VoIP experiments, we generated voice traffic with characteristics similar to those of the G.711 voice codec without Packet Loss Concealment (PLC) [8]. The payload size was set to 160 bytes, and the sending interval was 20 ms, resulting in a throughput of 64 Kbps. We collected 10 data sets, each 300 seconds long, after transmitting voice packets between the Mobile Node (MN) and the Corresponding Node (CN). Due to the lack of clock synchronization between the MN and CN, we could not measure one-way delay accurately. Instead, we measured round-trip delays and halved them to approximate one-way delays. Given the differences in uplink and downlink bandwidths, half the round-trip delay is likely to be larger than the one-way uplink delay. However, since the WiBro link was lightly loaded, we assume the difference in transmission delay to be minimal.

### Delay, Loss, and R-Factor Analysis
Figure 4 shows the time-series plots of (a) half-RTT, (b) loss rate, and (c) R-factor. Each vertical line indicates the time when either inter-RAS (solid line) or inter-sector (dashed line) handoff occurs. During the mobile experiment, 17 handoffs occurred, and most delay spikes and burst losses were observed near these handoffs. Almost all packets experienced delays below 200 ms, but during handoffs, some packets experienced delays over 400 ms. A significant delay spike of 5 seconds was noted around 1600 to 1700 seconds on the x-axis. Delay spikes and burst losses can be caused by various factors such as cell or sector reselection, link-level error recovery, wireless bandwidth fluctuation, and blocking by higher-priority traffic [15, 5]. This particular delay spike did not coincide with a handoff and requires further investigation.

### R-Factor in Uplink and Downlink
Figure 5 presents the R-factor for VoIP quality in both uplink (MN to CN) and downlink (CN to MN) under stationary and mobile conditions. The R-factor was calculated every 5 seconds. Over 99% of the R-factors were above 90 in both stationary and mobile cases, with only 0.2% of R-factors below 70 in the mobile case. An R-factor of 70 or above is considered toll-quality, indicating that mobile devices on the WiBro network are likely to experience toll-quality VoIP.

### Impact of Handoffs on QoS
To quantify the impact of handoffs on VoIP QoS, we computed R-factors using average delay and loss rates for 5-second intervals before and after handoffs and compared them with the overall cumulative distribution function (CDF) of R-factors (Figure 6). Approximately 99% of R-factors during handoffs were more than 85, which translates to good quality for voice communication.

## 5 Summary and Future Work

In this study, we conducted experiments to evaluate the Quality of Service (QoS) of VoIP applications over the WiBro network. We measured and analyzed the characteristics of delay and throughput under stationary and mobile scenarios to capture the baseline performance of the WiBro network. We then evaluated VoIP QoS using the E-Model of ITU-T G.107. Our measurements showed that the maximum achievable throughputs were 5.3 Mbps in downlink and 2 Mbps in uplink. Despite user mobility exceeding the projected limit of WiBro mobility support, VoIP quality was at least as good as toll quality. Using RAS and sector identification information, we demonstrated that handoffs correlate with throughput and quality degradation.

The WiBro network is in its early deployment phase, with approximately 70,000 subscribers. As our CBR traffic analysis indicates, the network is lightly loaded, allowing near-maximum throughputs for many 5-second-long periods. In future work, we plan to conduct more experiments with cross-traffic injection and TCP traffic.
