### 5.3 Attacking Providers

#### 5.3.1 Identify the Target DNS Resolvers

To poison the DNS cache of a provider, an adversary must first identify the IP addresses of the DNS resolvers used by the provider. These resolvers are responsible for looking up the email servers of the customers during password recovery requests.

**Method:**
- We register accounts with each provider via their web portals. For our evaluation, we create 20 unique accounts per provider, each associated with a distinct domain registered specifically for this purpose.
- We trigger the password recovery procedure for these accounts to observe the infrastructure. To avoid detection, we limit the number of password recovery requests to ten per account.
- The email server of the provider will request the DNS resolver to look up the MX and A records for our email exchanger. This is necessary to send the password reset link.
- We monitor the DNS requests arriving at the nameservers of our domains and collect the IP addresses that sent these requests. These IP addresses belong to the DNS resolvers used by the providers.
- We repeat this process for each provider listed in Table 2.

**Table 2: Service Providers and DNS Resolvers**
- For each provider, we list the service providers of the email servers and the DNS resolvers (by mapping the observed IP addresses to ASNs).
- We also measure whether the resolvers support DNSSEC and the default EDNS size in DNS requests.

#### 5.3.2 Poison Providersâ€™ DNS Caches

To evaluate the vulnerabilities to DNS cache poisoning across the providers, we test various methodologies against the DNS resolvers of the providers in our dataset.

**Method:**
- The adversary triggers the password recovery procedure and applies DNS cache poisoning techniques to inject malicious records into the DNS cache of the provider. These records map the email servers of our victim domains to hosts controlled by the adversary.
- We report on the results of our evaluations and the extent of the vulnerabilities among the providers.

**HijackDNS:**
- To determine the scope of providers vulnerable to sub-prefix hijacks, we perform Internet measurements. Many networks filter BGP advertisements with prefixes more specific than /24, so we consider an IP address vulnerable if it lies inside a network block whose advertised size is larger than /24.
- We map all resolvers' IP addresses to network blocks and use BGPStream from CAIDA [2] and routing data from RIPE RIS [38] and RouteViews collectors [44] to analyze the BGP announcements.
- Our analysis in Table 2 shows that the networks of 29 providers are vulnerable to sub-prefix hijacks.
- We simulate same-prefix hijack attacks using a topological map of the AS-relationship dataset of the customer domains and the providers. Our simulations show that an adversary can succeed in attacking 80% of the Alexa customer domains with a 60% success probability. This high success rate is due to the concentration of nameservers in a few ASes.

**SadDNS & FragDNS:**
- To test vulnerabilities to SadDNS and FragDNS, we perform the evaluations described in Sections 4.4 and 4.5.
- Out of 31 tested providers, 28 (90%) are vulnerable to FragDNS, and four are vulnerable to SadDNS. Vulnerabilities for each provider are listed in Table 1.

### 5.4 Measurements of Vulnerable Customers

The success of the attack against a specific victim customer depends not only on the vulnerabilities in the DNS resolver of the provider but also on the properties of the customer's domain.

**Method:**
- We evaluate the attack methodologies in Section 4 against the DNS resolvers we own and control, using responses from the domains of the customers in our dataset. This helps us determine if the attack methodology is effective against a particular customer.

**Results:**
- **HijackDNS:** More than 60% of the domains have all their nameservers on prefixes less than /24. Additionally, over 20% of the domains host all their nameservers on a single prefix, making them vulnerable to sub-prefix hijacks.
- **SadDNS:** Our automated simulation of the SadDNS attack shows that poisoning succeeds after an average of 471 seconds (min 39s, max 779s). Our test implementation triggers 497 queries on average per domain, resulting in a hit rate of 0.2%. Our results indicate that 8,469 accounts from the RIRs dataset and 11% of the accounts from the Alexa dataset could be hijacked via the SadDNS method.
- **FragDNS:** We measured the victim customers' nameservers for support of ICMP errors and fragmentation. We send a DNS request to the nameserver for ANY type DNS record and analyze the responses.

**Figure 4: Cumulative Distribution of Lowest Fragment Size**
- The figure shows the cumulative distribution of the lowest fragment size of nameservers (left) and domains (right) after sending ICMP PTB messages.

This comprehensive approach allows us to understand the vulnerabilities and potential impact of DNS cache poisoning attacks on both providers and their customers.
