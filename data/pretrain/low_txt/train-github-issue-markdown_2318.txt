After integrating the `console.command` tags into Shopware (as per shopware5/shopware#559), we had a discussion about the `Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\DependencyInjection\Compiler\AddConsoleCommandPass` and its dependency on the FrameworkBundle.

For projects that only use `symfony/console` and `symfony/dependency-injection`, it is necessary to copy this CompilerPass. @bcremer and @xabbuh proposed some ideas for moving this class. 

Perhaps there is a way to optimize command registration through the Dependency Injection Container (DIC) to avoid this issue.
