To install and configure an Active Directory Domain Controller on a Windows Server, follow the steps below:

1. Open "Server Manager" and select "Add Roles and Features."
2. In the "Add Roles and Features Wizard," click "Next" and choose "Role-based or feature-based installation." Then, click "Next" again.
3. Select the target server from the list (if you are working with multiple servers) and click "Next."
4. Check the box for "Active Directory Domain Services" and click "Next." You may be prompted to add additional features required for AD DS; confirm this action if necessary.
5. Review your selections and click "Next," then "Install" to begin the installation process.
6. Once the installation is complete, click "Close."

After installing the role, proceed with the configuration as follows:

7. The "Promote this server to a domain controller" link should now appear in the "Notifications" area of the "Server Manager Dashboard." Click it to launch the "Active Directory Domain Services Configuration Wizard."
8. Choose "Add a domain controller to an existing domain" and click "Next."
9. Enter the name of the domain where you wish to add the new DC, along with valid domain administrator credentials, and click "Next."
10. Specify the domain functional level, DNS delegation options, and directory services restore mode (DSRM) password. Also, decide whether to install DNS alongside AD DS, which is recommended for most scenarios.
11. On the "Paths" page, review the default locations for the AD DS database, log files, and SYSVOL folder. Modify these paths if needed, then click "Next."
12. Review your choices on the "Summary" page and click "Next" to start the prerequisite check. If all prerequisites are met, click "Install" to begin the promotion process.
13. After the configuration completes successfully, click "Finish" to close the wizard.

Your Windows Server is now set up as an Active Directory Domain Controller. Remember to perform any necessary post-installation tasks, such as verifying replication, updating Group Policy, and ensuring proper backups are in place.
