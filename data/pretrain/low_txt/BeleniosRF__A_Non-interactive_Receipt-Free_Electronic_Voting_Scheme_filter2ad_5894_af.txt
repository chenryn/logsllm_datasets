# Cost and Performance of Groth-Sahai Proofs

The primary cost in our system is the verification of Groth-Sahai proofs, which typically requires approximately 64(k + 1) pairings. This can be reduced to 4(k + 35) pairings using techniques from [11] and [31]. Based on the performance data provided by Beuchat et al. [10], we expect a throughput of around 5 ballots per second per core for k = 10. Additionally, these checks can be distributed over the voting period as ballots are received.

# The Blazy et al. Voting Protocol and Ballot Privacy

Blazy et al. [12] introduced the concept of signatures on randomizable ciphertexts and proposed using this primitive for a receipt-free e-voting protocol. The workflow for ballot creation and casting in their protocol is as follows:

- **Voter's Action**: The voter sends a ballot \( b = (vk, c = \{v\}_r, \pi_{t,v} \in \{0,1\}, pk, \sigma_{vk,s}) \), where \( r, s, t \in \mathbb{Z}_p \) represent the randomness used for encrypting the vote \( v \), signing the ciphertext \( c \), and generating the NIZK proof \( \pi \), respectively.
- **Server's Action**: The server re-randomizes the ballot \( b \) to \( b' \) as follows: \( b' = (vk, c = \{v\}_{r'}, \pi_{t',v} \in \{0,1\}, pk, \sigma_{vk,s'}) \), where \( r', s', t' \xleftarrow{\$} \mathbb{Z}_p \).

Similar to BeleniosRF, the server can only re-randomize legitimate signatures, ensuring that any new ballot \( b' \) with a valid signature must originate from a previously created ballot \( b \) by the voter, thus preserving the same vote.

### Attack on Ballot Privacy

However, the above workflow is not ballot-private, let alone receipt-free. A known attack, the ballot replay attack, can break ballot privacy [23]:

- **Honest Voter**: Sends a ballot \( b = (vk, c = \{v\}_r, \pi_{t,v} \in \{0,1\}, pk, \sigma_{vk,s}) \).
- **Server**: Re-randomizes the ballot \( b \) to \( b' = (vk, c = \{v\}_{r'}, \pi_{t',v} \in \{0,1\}, pk, \sigma_{vk,s'}) \) and posts it on the public bulletin board.
- **Dishonest Voter**: With credentials \( (\bar{vk}, \bar{sk}) \) and knowledge of the target ballot \( b' \):
  - Copies \( c = \{v\}_{r'} \) and generates a new ciphertext \( \bar{c} = \{v\}_{\bar{r}} \) with \( \pi_{\bar{t},v} \in \{0,1\} \).
  - Signs \( \bar{c} \) with \( \bar{sk} \) to get \( \sigma_{\bar{vk},\bar{s}} \).
  - Sends a new ballot \( \bar{b} = (vk, \bar{c} = \{v\}_{\bar{r}}, \pi_{\bar{t},v} \in \{0,1\}, pk, \sigma_{\bar{vk},\bar{s}}) \).

This process allows a dishonest voter to produce an independent-looking ballot \( \bar{b} \) that will be accepted by the voting server and effectively contains a copy of the vote in \( b \). Thus, the voting protocol [12] is not ballot-private.

# Conclusions

We introduced the notion of strong receipt-freeness, where a malicious voter cannot produce a receipt proving how they voted, regardless of whether the voter decided to act maliciously before, during, or after casting the ballot. Our adversarial model aligns closely with the seminal work on receipt-freeness by Benaloh and Tuinstra [8].

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scheme that is both receipt-free (in a strong sense) and has universal verifiability (in the sense of strong verifiability [22]), without requiring an untappable channel or secure hardware tokens. We only require that the receipt-freeness adversary does not eavesdrop on the communication between the voter and the voting server, and the existence of a re-randomization service. This approach overcomes the impossibility result [19], which states that no scheme can be both receipt-free and universally verifiable without an untappable channel.

We achieve this by relying on a ballot box server that is entrusted to re-randomize ballots without changing their contents, in a publicly verifiable way [12]. Finally, we demonstrated the feasibility of our approach by implementing a voting client in JavaScript and measuring its performance across various platforms.
