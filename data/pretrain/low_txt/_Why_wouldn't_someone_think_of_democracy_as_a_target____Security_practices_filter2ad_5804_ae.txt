### Introduction

The high-profile cyberattacks of 2016 served as a catalyst, raising critical questions about the digital security responsibilities of political campaigns. Our study suggests that we are witnessing a population in the midst of a significant shift. The full scope of changes that campaigns will implement over the next decade remains uncertain. However, it is clear that their work culture, security norms, and the tools and processes they adopt (such as risk assessments, auditing, automated threat scanning, managed hardware, zero-trust environments, and hiring dedicated security professionals) will evolve. Behavior change is challenging and often requires time. We believe that transforming the security culture of campaigns will necessitate the involvement of a diverse group of experts, including those from political committees and organizations, technology companies, and academia.

In this section, we propose ideas to guide the shift toward prioritizing security. Specifically, we suggest three near-term areas of investment for those who support campaigns: (1) establishing effective, consistent security guidance; (2) improving the usability of account security; and (3) enhancing the affordability of security protections. We also highlight long-term areas for future research. Table 2 summarizes our findings and recommendations.

### 5.1 Education & Consistent Guidance

Most users, including campaign workers, do not prioritize security [44, 93]. We believe that security training for individuals involved with campaigns will be crucial for fostering a work culture that values security. This view was shared by many experts in our roundtable [25].

Some participants noted that various party committees and organizations have already initiated efforts to train campaign staff, consultants, and committee members on security. For example, the DDC (Democratic Digital Coalition) ramped up educational efforts across many federal campaigns during the 2020 election cycle and provided free hardware security keys to staff on over 140 campaigns. However, these efforts are relatively new and often reference guides (such as the D3P Cybersecurity Campaign Playbook [10], Device and Account Security Checklist 2.0 [56], and others) that, while offering good security advice, differ in the order of which security actions they prioritize. This inconsistency can cause confusion and inaction, similar to the challenges observed in providing security advice to general Internet users [73].

To address this, it would be beneficial if the people and organizations that campaigns trust (political influencers, political committees, technology providers, policymakers, etc.) recommend the same top-priority security protections. Additionally, consistent technical language should be used when guidance from various sources refers to technical concepts and features.

Education and training will be key components of improving campaign security, but they are not a panacea. Training should begin as early as possible in the campaign. Security guidance needs to be championed by influential figures such as the campaign manager, senior staff, and certain consultants [25]. While the candidate may not typically set security priorities, they can play a role in communicating the importance of security. We acknowledge that even with more consistent guidance, educational efforts will still be limited by the pace, resources, attention, and priorities of campaign workers.

### 5.2 Usable Account Security

Campaigns face numerous vulnerabilities and potential threats, and solutions should prioritize the ability and willingness of campaign personnel to use strong account security protections.

#### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Usability issues with 2FA are well-documented, even in cases where the motivation to employ it is high (e.g., for banking [39, 50]). Our results show that 2FA adoption among campaign workers is lagging, and when it is used, weaker options like SMS codes are often preferred. Many participants had a poor understanding of 2FA, the protections offered by different second factors, and the importance of using 2FA on most accounts. Campaign workers use many accounts and providers, and the user experience of 2FA varies across platforms.

To better support campaign workers, technology providers could explore ways to improve 2FA usability across different platforms. Users need clear and consistent guidance on what type of 2FA to use and for which accounts, as well as an understanding of why 2FA is important for securing elections.

#### Password Practices

Passwords are the first line of defense for accounts, and password managers can help users manage strong, unique passwords and minimize the risk of entering credentials into phishing sites. For shared accounts, password managers can help manage and secure strong credentials. However, most participants felt that password managers required too much overhead to set up and use, making widespread adoption unlikely.

Technology providers can support this population by improving the integration and interoperability of password managers, browsers, and apps. Password managers should also provide explicit warnings when users attempt to enter credentials on unknown or potentially phishing sites, along with advice on how to identify problems.

#### Shared and Transiently Owned Accounts

Participants observed that shared and transiently owned accounts often have weak security protections. Technology providers can help by improving multi-tenant account usability and making it easier to audit and change account access and ownership.

### 5.3 Policy: Affordable Technology & Training

Campaigns need assistance with the cost of security technologies and training. It is difficult for campaigns to invest in training staff who will move on to other jobs within a year or less. The return on investment in training is realized in the longer careers of those individuals in campaigns and politics, which may be hard for budget-constrained campaigns to justify. Staffers and consultants who receive security training can bring their knowledge and practices to subsequent campaigns.

Regarding security technologies, it is challenging to justify investments in infrastructure that will no longer be used after election day. The decision to invest in security technology and training is easier if such resources are freely available. Campaign finance laws and regulations often prevent companies and organizations from providing free security services or technologies to campaigns, absent specific exemptions [92]. Policymakers could consider ways to enable all campaigns to leverage free, effective, and easy-to-use security support to protect themselves and democracy.

### 5.4 Future Research

More research is needed to help a diverse group of experts from political committees and organizations, technology companies, and academia improve security for political campaigns. Foundational research exploring campaign security around the world, and with a broader range of campaigns and campaign workers, including down-ballot races and candidates' family members, would be beneficial.

Technology providers could benefit from usability studies of specific protections (such as 2FA, password management, and shared accounts), especially by recruiting from this population and observing product use in realistic contexts.

### 6. Conclusion

Our study highlights how ongoing security challenges facing political campaigns stem from a combination of work culture, technology practices, and underdeveloped threat models. Campaigns are transient organizations with tight budgets and amorphous boundaries, composed of busy people with limited security knowledge. Participants described digital security as a relatively new need for campaigns, one not often viewed as essential to winning elections, making investments in security hard to justify.

People on campaigns rely on a variety of personal and work accounts across platforms and domains. Their ad hoc adoption of 2FA, strong passwords, encryption, and access controls introduces vulnerabilities that are not consistently mitigated. Participants recognized a growing risk of state-sponsored attacks, particularly phishing, but noted that strong protections continue to lag in adoption.

No single company, organization, institution, or campaign can solve these problems alone. Protecting campaign accounts and data will be more successful as a joint effort, involving a variety of perspectives and collective action from technology companies, the policy community, committees and organizations that support campaigns, academic institutions, and individual users involved with campaigns. We provide an initial understanding of this complex problem space, which we hope will be used to develop effective solutions for this population.

In the near term, we suggest prioritizing effective, consistent security guidance to inform security education, investigating how to standardize usable account security protections (including 2FA, password managers, and multi-tenant accounts), and improving the affordability and availability of security technologies and training. In the longer term, efforts should focus on shifting the work culture of campaigns to prioritize security. With such collective action, the security community can do its part to improve digital security for campaigns, helping to protect future elections and democracy.
