## Related Work

X-Vine provides multi-hop social network routing, logarithmic state Sybil defense, protects privacy of friendship information, and enables pseudonymous communication. Our work is the first to provide these properties. However, X-Vine builds upon foundational work in several areas:

### Sybil Defense

Sybil defenses must fundamentally impose a cost on participation in the network [22]. One approach, advocated by Castro et al. [16], requires users to provide identity credentials and/or payment to a centralized authority, which then issues certificates allowing users to participate. This authority, of course, becomes a central point of trust. Decentralized approaches instead allow nodes to directly verify some resource expenditure by other nodes, such as CPU computation or the possession of a unique IP address [12, 55]. All these solutions face a tradeoff between creating too high a barrier for participation by honest users and making it too easy for malicious users to create Sybil identities. More recent work has recognized that it is expensive for a malicious adversary to establish trust relationships with honest users, and thus social network topologies can be used to detect and mitigate social Sybil attacks. The design of X-Vine is based on the same principle.

**SybilGuard [69] and SybilLimit [68]** are decentralized systems for Sybil defense. These systems use special random walks called random routes for Sybil defense. In SybilLimit, as long as the number of attack edges is less than a threshold (g = o(log n)), then with high probability, a short random walk of O(log n) steps is likely to stay within the set of honest nodes. Nodes in SybilLimit perform √e short random walks (where e is the number of edges amongst the honest nodes) and keep track of their last edges (tails). By the birthday paradox, two honest nodes will share a common tail with high probability. Each node allows only a certain number of random routes to traverse it, thereby limiting the number of Sybil identities that are validated by the honest nodes.

**SybilInfer [21]** provides an algorithm for labeling nodes in a social network as honest users or Sybils controlled by an adversary. It takes as input a social graph G and generates a set of traces using short random walks. Using a mathematical model of an honest social network, it performs Bayesian inference to output a set of dishonest nodes. The Bayesian inference approach can even be used to assign probabilities to nodes of being honest or dishonest. These systems are standalone Sybil defenses and do not provide DHT functionality.

**Whanau [34]** is the state-of-the-art Sybil-resilient DHT [20, 33] where nodes can communicate with only one intermediate hop. Each node performs √e random walks to sample nodes for constructing their routing tables; the Sybil-resistant property of short random walks ensures that a high fraction of the sampled nodes are honest. By querying routing table entries, nodes can construct their successor lists. Compared to X-Vine, Whanau provides its properties at the cost of maintaining √n log n state at each node (where n is the number of objects). The large state requirements mean that the system has difficulty maintaining accurate state in the face of object churn. Whanau also requires the entire social graph to be public, presenting significant privacy concerns. In contrast, X-Vine builds upon network-layer DHTs, embedding the DHT directly into the social network fabric. This enables X-Vine to provide good security while achieving improved scalability and privacy of social relationships. Moreover, X-Vine provides support for pseudonymous communication.

### Security and Privacy in DHTs

Other work deals with the issue of secure routing when a fraction of nodes in the DHT are compromised [16, 31, 46, 57, 63]. Sit and Morris [57], as well as Wallach [63], discuss security issues in DHTs. Castro [16] proposed the use of redundant routing to improve the lookup security. Nambiar and Wright [46] showed that redundant lookups in Chord may traverse a few common nodes, and thus a few malicious nodes could subvert all of the redundant lookups. They designed the Salsa DHT in which redundant lookups are unlikely to traverse common nodes. Kapadia and Triandopoulos [31] propose to make redundant routes diverse by making use of the observation that to perform a lookup for A, it suffices to lookup the nodes which have A as its finger, and then query them. Unlike X-Vine, these systems are not concerned with the problem of Sybil attacks. Another line of research deals with the privacy of the DHT lookup. Borisov [11] and Ciaccio [18] proposed incorporating anonymity into the lookup, but their algorithms do not consider active attacks. More recently, anonymous and secure lookups were considered in the designs of Salsa [46], NISAN [48], and Torsk [39]. However, recent work [42, 65] showed vulnerabilities in all three designs. X-Vine improves the privacy of a user by enabling pseudonymous communication; the IP address of a user is revealed only to a user’s trusted friends.

### Social Networks and Routing

The benefits of using social network links for overlay routing have been recognized in a large body of academic work and deployed systems.

**Hybrid routing using social network links:** Systems in this class maintain traditional peer-to-peer structures but also make use of social network connections. Sprout [36] proposed augmenting the finger tables in traditional DHTs, such as Chord, with social network links. The authors showed that the added connections could improve the security of the routing mechanism. However, Sprout does not defend against Sybil attacks and is not concerned with user privacy. OneSwarm [30] is a deployed peer-to-peer communication system for improving user privacy where routing is performed by combining trusted and untrusted peer relationships. Tribler [51] increases download speed in BitTorrent by discovering and downloading file chunks stored at peers. Similarly, Maze [17] leverages a social network to discover peers and cooperatively download files. These three systems leverage flooding to provide any-to-any reachability, and thus cannot scale to large networks. The hybrid systems are not resilient to Sybil attacks. Moreover, they allow direct contacts over untrusted links, exposing users’ IP addresses.

**Routing only using social network links:** All communication in this class of systems is over social network links. This enables participants in the network to be hidden from each other, providing a high degree of privacy. Such a network is commonly known as a darknet. WASTE [24] is a deployed decentralized chat, instant messaging, and file-sharing protocol, and is widely considered to be the first darknet. WASTE does not attempt to scale beyond small networks, and its suggested size is limited to 50 users. Turtle [50] is a deployed decentralized anonymous peer-to-peer communication protocol. Nodes in Turtle do not maintain any state information other than their trusted friend links and use controlled flooding to search for data items. Flooding methods create significant overhead as network size increases. Freenet [19] is a deployed decentralized censorship-resistant distributed storage system. Version 0.7 of Freenet nodes can be configured to run in darknet or opennet mode; the latter allows connections from untrusted nodes and is expected to be used by less privacy-sensitive users. Freenet’s routing algorithm is heuristic and does not guarantee that data will be found at all; it has also been shown to be extremely vulnerable even against a few malicious nodes [23]. Membership concealing overlay networks (MCONs) (formalized by Vasserman et al. [61]) hide the real-world identities of the participants through the use of overlay and DHT-based routing. However, their design makes use of a trusted centralized server and also requires flooding when a new user joins the network. In addition to these limitations, none of the above systems are resilient to Sybil attacks.

## Limitations

We now discuss some limitations of our design. First, X-Vine requires a user’s social contacts to be part of the overlay; the DHT needs to be bootstrapped from a single contiguous trust network. Next, X-Vine assumes that Sybil identities are distributed randomly in the DHT identifier space. We emphasize that this assumption is shared by prior systems [20], and defending multi-hop DHTs against targeted clustering attacks is currently an open problem. In future work, we will investigate the possibility of adapting the cuckoo hashing mechanism [33] proposed by Lesniewski-Laas (for one-hop DHTs) in the context of securing multi-hop DHTs. X-Vine also does not defend against attackers who target users by compromising nodes close to them in the social network topology. Finally, applications using X-Vine experience higher than usual latencies since all communications are pseudonymous and traverse multiple social network links.

## Conclusions

We describe X-Vine, a protection mechanism for DHTs that operates entirely by communicating over social network links. X-Vine requires O(log n) state, two orders of magnitude less in practical settings compared to existing techniques, making it particularly suitable for large-scale and dynamic environments. X-Vine also enhances privacy by not revealing social relationship information and by providing a basis for pseudonymous communication.
