## 1. Introduction
The increasing power and interconnectivity of modern computer systems enable the storage and processing of large amounts of data, making networked information accessible from anywhere at any time. This has facilitated the collection, exchange, access, processing, and linking of information. Consequently, there is a growing awareness of privacy concerns, which have become the subject of public debates. The need for privacy-aware policies, regulations, and techniques is widely recognized. This workshop aims to address these privacy challenges in global interconnected societies and propose possible solutions.
