## Discussion

### Feasibility of Adding Sensors
As shown in Table 4, using sensors is a common approach in proposed solutions to prevent passive attacks in contactless payments. The primary research question addressed in this paper is to determine which set of sensors can be used to prevent attacks while maintaining the existing usage model. It is worth noting that some commercialized bank cards, such as the Mastercard Biometric Card, already incorporate sensors, demonstrating the feasibility of embedding sensors on bank cards. However, the Mastercard Biometric Card requires the user to press the fingerprint sensor to make a payment, thereby changing the existing usage model.

### Usability
The System Usability Scale (SUS) is a widely used framework for assessing users' satisfaction with the usability of computer systems [3]. It has been employed in previous studies [19, 20] to compare the usability among similar systems for pairing. We chose SUS over other usability tests, such as the Single Ease Question (SEQ), to establish a comparable benchmark for the usability of contactless payment systems. In our user study, we used the original SUS questions without modification [3]. Users generally found the questions easy to understand, but some were confused by the terms "inconsistency" in Q6 and "cumbersome" in Q8 (see Table 3). This highlights a limitation of using SUS in our context. However, it is well-known that SUS questions are phrased for general purposes, and in specific contexts, users may occasionally find the wording of some questions not perfectly fitting [3].

### Extension
In future work, we plan to investigate the feasibility of using OPay for wearable payment devices, such as NFC-enabled jewelry and key fobs, which are vulnerable to both passive replay (PR) and mPoS-based passive (MP) attacks. Applying OPay to these devices will require some adaptation of the orientation definition for each device, as the usage model varies with different payment devices.

## Conclusion
In this paper, we introduced OPay, a novel orientation-based solution to prevent both passive replay attacks and mPoS-based passive attacks against contactless payment devices. We built a concrete prototype and conducted a user study to evaluate its feasibility. Users generally found our solution as easy-to-use as a normal contactless payment experience, with a response time of only 0.228 seconds. OPay substantially reduced the attack success rate from 100% to between 1-15%, with a false rejection rate of only 4.76%. These results make OPay a useful solution for combating fraud in contactless payment systems.
