### Figure 14: Confidence Level vs. Fraction of Flows

- **Connection Identification**: We search for connections to the same remote endpoint, such as the same {IP, port} pair, in the known set. This method is inspired by the work in [10].

- **ADSL Host Detection**: We perform reverse DNS lookups for each remote IP to identify ADSL machines. Most providers use a simple syntax consisting of an IP address and specific keywords to identify their users' hosts. The list of keywords used is provided in Table 7, which is inspired by [19]. This approach is based on the hypothesis that communication between two ADSL hosts is likely due to a P2P application.

The above procedure is formalized in Algorithm 1. The results for the P2P predictions are presented in Figure 15. Overall, we found that at least half of the bytes and flows classified with high confidence predictions are further reinforced by the results of Algorithm 1. The reason some P2P flows were not classified by ODT lies in the method used to detect these applications. DPI tools typically need to monitor the beginning of the flows.

### 7.3.2 Web Predictions

For the flows classified as Web, we attempt to connect to each endpoint using `wget` to check for active Web servers. The hit ratio was very low, below 3%. However, the traces are more than one year old, so we cannot verify how many servers were actually active during the capture period.

Using reverse DNS queries, we verified that most endpoints involved in the flows predicted as Web flows were residential hosts. In such cases, the existence of transient Web servers can be attributed to malicious activities like Fast Flux networks [6], where compromised machines are used as proxies to hide a Web server. There is also an increasing trend of using the HTTP protocol to control bots, making detection more difficult [11]. This behavior could explain the results of our classifier and the fact that the flows were unknown to ODT. We leave this hypothesis for future study.

### 7.3.3 Throughput Distributions Comparison

To validate the predictions made by the statistical classifier, we plotted the throughput distributions for flows in a given class in both the known and unknown sets. The resulting CDFs are presented in Figure 16. We observe that the throughputs for EDONKEY and BITTORRENT predictions are similar and clearly smaller than those of the known Web class, which aligns with the fact that residential end hosts are generally less provisioned than Web servers. Conversely, the unknown Web class significantly differs from the known one, supporting the hypothesis that malicious activities are at play.

### 7.4 The Unknown Class - Discussion

We have demonstrated that a supervised model for traffic classification can be useful in mining unknown traffic. High-confidence predictions were further validated using various heuristics based on endpoint information and port numbers. We presented the usage of a statistical classifier as a complementary method to tools like ODT. The prediction module can be integrated into the tool and used as an additional source of information in the labor-intensive process of updating signatures for new versions of emerging applications.

### 8. Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we adopted the perspective of an ADSL provider and critically evaluated the potential benefits of deploying statistical tools for application identification in a production environment.

**Positive Findings**:
- Statistical classification is useful for analyzing traffic left unidentifiable by DPI tools.
- It offers high performance when applied to the same site where the classifier was trained.
- It can discriminate between applications even if they rely on the same protocol, such as Web mail and Web file transfers.

**Negative Findings**:
- Statistical classification tools may suffer from data overfitting, preventing a simple strategy of training on the largest PoP and deploying on all other sites. To our knowledge, this has not been observed before.
- This problem persists across various feature sets and machine learning algorithms. Testing new classifiers on traces collected from different sites is crucial, especially on "homogeneous" traces in terms of traffic type and capture time.

**Future Work**:
- We aim to devise a strategy for selecting features that are robust in cross-site studies. One possible solution is to use per-application features instead of a shared set for all applications.
