### Top Certificate Issuers

The most common certificate issuers vary depending on the perspective studied. Let’s Encrypt is most popular in CT logs, while cPanel only appears in the top five for zone file scanning. IPv4 scanning results in a longer tail of issuers.

- **CT Logs:**
  - 15% GoDaddy
  - 9% GeoTrust
  - 7% GlobalSign
  - 5% Let’s Encrypt
  - 23% Other (567)

- **Zone File Scanning:**
  - 17% Let’s Encrypt
  - 16% Comodo
  - 15% GeoTrust
  - 7% GoDaddy
  - 7% cPanel
  - 62% Other (377)

- **IPv4 Scanning:**
  - 28%
  - 24%
  - 12%
  - 12%
  - 7%
  - 18%

### Combining CT and Censys Data

Our passive measurement identified 68,700 certificates not present in Censys. These certificates have a similar composition to those in CT logs that Censys missed. Specifically:
- 39% are issued by Let’s Encrypt, which requires frequent re-issuance.
- 20% are attributable to WordPress-hosted blogs.
- 13% are attributed to CloudFlare, services that heavily depend on SNI and would not be seen by IPv4 scans.

### Vulnerability to FREAK

Vulnerability rates measured by each methodology vary significantly. Table 9 shows the rate of vulnerability to the FREAK attack across different perspectives.

- **IPv4 Scan:**
  - 1.88% of IPs vulnerable
- **Common Crawl:**
  - 4.54% of IPs vulnerable
- **Zones:**
  - 3.91% of IPs vulnerable
- **Alexa:**
  - 2.71% of IPs vulnerable
- **CT Scan:**
  - 3.73% of IPs vulnerable

**Table 9: Rate of Vulnerability to FREAK—Vulnerability rates measured by each methodology vary significantly.**

### Coverage Analysis

Combining data from CT logs and Censys yields 99.4% coverage of all observed certificates and 99.7% of all FQDNs and sites. However, since these are our two largest data sources, this statistic may be artificially inflated.

Scanning all domains in the .com, .net, and .org zone files provides ground truth for all sites served on the root and www subdomains in those zones. This subset includes 153 million unique domains. We compare Censys data and CT logs over the certificates obtained from the zone scans in Table 7.

- **Zone Certificates:**
  - 98.5% are obtained through either Censys or CT logs.
  - This is smaller than the corresponding percentage for all observed certificates, indicating that there are likely certificates hosted in other zones and subdomains not observed by any method we use.
  - The coverage of IPv4 scans and CT logs on the entire population of certificates on the Internet is overestimated by Table 6.
  - Conversely, the coverage of Censys scanning on the zone dataset is increased to 54%, from 38% over all observed certificates. This is potentially due to certificates in CT logs that are not actively hosted on the Internet (e.g., intranet sites).

### Impact on HTTPS Research

Recent studies using IPv4 and Alexa Top Million scanning to measure HTTPS deployment [4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 22, 28, 31, 32] may not accurately reflect the state of the Internet if performed today, as IPv4 scans miss nearly two-thirds of certificates.

To illustrate, Table 9 presents a survey of sites vulnerable to the FREAK attack, showing the number of vulnerable hosts varies with each perspective. The vulnerability rates range from 1.88% of IPs vulnerable when measured by IPv4 scanning to 4.54% of IPs vulnerable when measured by our Common Crawl scan.

### Related Work

This work builds on a large body of research focusing on the HTTPS ecosystem and supporting PKI [4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 28, 31, 32]. Studies have ranged from the CA ecosystem [11, 14] to cryptographic keys generated without entropy [16], and how operators react to vulnerabilities [10].

In 2010, the EFF launched the SSL Observatory [14], performing an IPv4 address space scan to identify trusted CAs. In 2011, Vratonjic et al. [31] found that only 5.7% of websites correctly deploy HTTPS. Holz et al. [18] combined active measurements with passive data from a large research institution, briefly comparing differences caused by scan origins.

Durumeric et al. [11] analyzed the HTTPS PKI by repeatedly scanning the IPv4 address space. They found that SNI was not widely required at that time. Other studies have used data from the Alexa Top Million [19] and scans of the IPv4 ecosystem [10, 15, 16]. Recent studies have also investigated TLS deployment outside of HTTPS [9, 17].

Our work focuses on validating different methodologies for studying the HTTPS PKI, aiming to help future papers obtain more accurate measurements.

### Conclusion

Over the past five years, numerous studies have measured the HTTPS ecosystem and supporting PKI. Without a clear ground truth, these studies have pieced together a view based on fractured and imperfect methodologies. We find that IPv4 enumeration no longer provides a representative view of TLS server configurations due to SNI deployment. IPv4 scans miss more than two-thirds of valid certificates, and associated measurements can differ dramatically from site-based approaches.

Certificate Transparency (CT) provides a new perspective, finding 90.5% of certificates observed in this study but is skewed towards a few authorities that submit the certificates they issue. A more comprehensive yet readily accessible methodology is to use a combination of CT and Censys data, which together account for 99.4% of observed certificates. We are working with the Censys team to implement continuous certificate synchronization between Censys and Google’s CT logs, which will soon make either data source a nearly comprehensive view of trusted HTTPS certificates.
