### Generator Maintenance and Grid Isolation

To perform follow-up maintenance tasks on the generator connected to Bus 2, it is necessary to isolate the generator from the rest of the grid. In real-world practice, inter-area power transfers should be maintained according to scheduled values [58].

**Source of Incident:**
The incident occurred due to a lack of regulation for actions that could impact remote power systems.

**Required Access Control Policy:**
- **Home Area Limitation:** Maintenance operators' actions should be confined to their home area.
- **Away Area Protection:** Their actions must not affect the operation of the away area.

**Effects of CPAC Deployment:**
CPAC (Controlled Physical Access Control) denies Alice's action request after completing its physics-based analysis. As shown in Figure 11b, if Alice's action were to occur, the line on the inter-area tie-line (which connects the home and away areas) would be indirectly affected. Therefore, her action is denied.

**Prolog Policy Rule for Case B:**
```prolog
curr_low(0).
curr_high(100).

event_curr_inrange_alice(U, I, N, W) :-
    U == Alice, I == w, N == currReq,
    curr_low(L), curr_high(H), W >= L, W =< H.
```

### Appendix

#### A. Second-Order Taylor Expansion

CPAC implements physical information flow analysis through dynamic behavior inspection of the plant around the equilibrium state defined by Equation 1 (Section 4). This is achieved using the plant's Taylor approximate equivalent, Equation 5, which involves the first-order partial derivatives (Jacobian matrix) of the power plant's vector-valued function \( f_x = \frac{\partial f}{\partial u} (x_0, u_0, \lambda_0) \) and \( f_\lambda = \frac{\partial f}{\partial \lambda} (x_0, u_0, \lambda_0) \). Assuming \( f_x \) is non-singular, we can reorder Equation 4 as:

\[
\Delta w = (w_u - w_x f^{-1}_x) \Delta u + \frac{1}{2} (f^{-1}_x)^T w_{xx} f^{-1}_x \Delta u^2 + \frac{1}{2} w_{uu} \Delta u^2
\]

The sensor measurements are correlated with the plant state and the operator's control inputs through Equation 2 at the nominal operating point.
