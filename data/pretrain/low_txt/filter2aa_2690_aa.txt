- **Summary:** The story, published in 1989, details an incident from August 1986. It describes how an unauthorized user, later identified as a hacker, gained root access to the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) system by exploiting a vulnerability in the `movemail` function of the original GNU Emacs.

**Key Points:**
- **Authentication Breach:** The hacker exploited a vulnerability to gain unauthorized access.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The hacker acquired root access, allowing full control over the system.

### Question
- **Why do we still face the same security problems after almost 30 years?**

---

### Inventory and Lifecycle Management
- **Do we have a complete and up-to-date inventory of all our systems?**
- **Are there any legacy, zombie, or ghost systems still in use?**

**Statistics:**
- According to NetMarketShare (July 2015), many organizations still use outdated operating systems.
- [NetMarketShare: Operating System Market Share](http://www.netmarketshare.com/operatingRsystemRmarketRshare.aspx?qprid=10&qpcustomd=0)

**Examples:**
- **Windows Server 2003:** Microsoft ended support on July 14, 2015.
- **MS15-078 Critical Update:** Released on July 20, 2015, it replaced MS15-077 but did not cover Windows Server 2003.

  - [Microsoft: MS15-078](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms15-078.aspx)

**OpenSSL Support:**
- **Version 0.9.8 and 1.0.0:** Support ends on December 31, 2015.
- **Version 1.0.1:** Supported until December 31, 2016.
- **Version 1.0.2:** Supported until December 31, 2019.

### Authentication and Authorization
- **Example:** Target Corporation
  - The initial intrusion into Target's systems was traced back to network credentials stolen from a third-party vendor.
  - **Questions:**
    - Why did that vendor need access?
    - What authorization was granted?

### Software Vulnerabilities and Exploits
- **Key Statistics:**
  - 99.9% of exploited vulnerabilities were compromised more than a year after the CVE was published.
  - About half of the CVEs exploited in 2014 went from publish to pwn in less than a month.
