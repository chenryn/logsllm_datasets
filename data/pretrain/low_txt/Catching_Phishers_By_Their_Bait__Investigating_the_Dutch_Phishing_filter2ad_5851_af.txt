### Institutions Affected by Phishing Attacks

To enhance the landscape of phishing attack measurements, a repository of phishing kit fingerprints can be instrumental. Similar to repositories for malware fingerprints, various stakeholders—such as hosting providers, volunteers, and researchers—can contribute their analyses on phishing kits. This collaborative effort would help in tracking and understanding this pervasive tactic. However, for such an exchange to be effective, it is essential to standardize the description of phishing kits, their tactics, and detection methods. Future work could address this gap by developing a standardized framework. In the interim, our system can be extended with (semi)automatic submission to anti-phishing services and blocklists, which would likely lead to faster responses.

### Conclusions

In this paper, we present the results of our investigation into the Dutch phishing landscape. We developed an empirical methodology to study phishing campaigns using phishing kit fingerprints. By leveraging the fact that phishers often use TLS certificates, we were able to capture the end-to-end lifecycle of these campaigns. Over a four-month period, we identified 1,363 confirmed phishing domains deploying such kits, with an average of 31 phishing domains active each day, waiting for victims. Most of these domains are online for only 24 hours, but many remain active for much longer. External validation with APWG data confirmed that our methodology can swiftly detect phishing websites and covers a complementary spectrum of phishing domains.

Additionally, we observed that attackers have enhanced their techniques to lure victims into disclosing their credentials. They now use decoy pages that do not immediately demand credentials but eventually do so. These decoy pages separate the target organization from the one impersonated on the phishing page, providing numerous possibilities for attackers. The use of regular words in domain names, rather than referring to the target organization, is more common, making it easier to trick victims into clicking on phishing links.

Through a combination of our analysis on the anatomy of phishing kits and the crawls of phishing domains, we demonstrate that the Dutch phishing landscape is less diverse than expected. Many phishers are using the same framework, uAdmin. The arrest of the developer of this framework in February 2021, along with the corresponding news coverage, indicates that our findings are relevant globally, as uAdmin is widely used. By reconstructing the timeline of a typical phishing campaign, we show that phishers move quickly, necessitating swift and decisive interventions.

We believe that the insights from this work will help law enforcement agencies (LEAs) and intermediaries design faster responses to this evolving threat. We encourage them to conduct similar analyses of their local phishing landscapes.
