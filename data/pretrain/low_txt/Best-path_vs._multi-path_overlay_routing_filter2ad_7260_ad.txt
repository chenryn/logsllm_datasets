### Maximum Outage Time and Network Context

Applications operate within the context of an underlying network, which has its own loss rates, patterns of loss (such as outages, burst losses, and congestive losses), and latency variations.

### Bandwidth Budget for Application Designers

In our model, application designers have a "bandwidth budget" that they can allocate to meet their performance goals. This budget can be spent on probing, packet duplication, or a combination of both. For a given application, the optimal allocation of this budget between reactive routing and mesh routing is a key consideration.

### 5.1 Probe-based Reactive Overlay Routing

Reactive routing assumes that at least one path through the overlay network can provide good service. Techniques like Forward Error Correction (FEC) and redundant routing can even construct a better path from multiple suboptimal paths. This approach handles different failure scenarios. If no individual paths are good, reactive routing does not help. However, if failures result in only a small subset of functional paths, a probe-based reactive mechanism can effectively utilize these paths.

**Benefits:**
- Reactive routing circumvents path failures in a time proportional to its probing rate. For \( n \) possible one-hop paths from a source to the destination, each with a loss probability \( p_i \), the effective loss rate is:
  \[
  p_{\text{reactive}} = \prod_{i=1}^{n} (1 - p_i)
  \]
- Reactive routing is limited by the latency of the best path. The path with the best loss rate may not have the best latency [1].

**Costs:**
- The cost of all-paths probing and route dissemination is fixed, with each host sending and receiving \( O(n^2) \) data. This cost is independent of the traffic volume, making it significant for thin data streams but negligible for high-bandwidth streams.

**Reality:**
- We do not know the loss rate of the theoretical best path, but reactive routing performs as expected within the constraints of how quickly it can adapt. The main question is whether the probing and routing overhead is worth the improvement it provides. Our data shows that many paths experience no benefit from reactive routing, but when they do, the benefits are often substantial.

### 5.2 Redundant Multi-path Routing

Redundant encoding is typically achieved using FEC techniques that add extra packets to the data stream, rather than increasing the size of individual packets. Efficient FEC sends the original packets first to avoid adding latency in the no-loss case. Reed-Solomon erasure codes are a standard FEC method that allows variable amounts of redundancy [28]. As a simpler alternative, packets can be duplicated and sent along multiple paths, as in mesh routing [31]. We limit our evaluation to 2-redundant routing over two paths, as we believe the number of truly loss-independent paths between two points on the Internet is relatively low.

**Benefits:**
- When paths are completely independent, redundant routing can handle the complete failure of up to \( R - 1 \) paths per node.
- For \( n \) paths with loss probabilities \( p_i \), the overall loss rate improves to the product of their individual loss rates:
  \[
  p_{\text{redundant}} = \prod_{i=1}^{n} p_i
  \]
- 2-redundant routing on random paths, in expectation, achieves the square of the average loss rate:
  \[
  E[p_{\text{2-redundant}}] = (E[p_i])^2
  \]
- When used with the direct Internet path, multi-path routing can provide smaller expected latency, even if the alternate paths have similar latency, while still reducing loss [31].

**Costs:**
- The cost of \( n \)-redundant routing is a factor of \( n \). A 2-redundant routing scheme doubles the amount of traffic sent. The cost does not depend on the network size.

**Reality:**
- 2-redundant mesh routing does not achieve a 2x improvement in loss rates due to the high correlation of lost packets. However, it does produce measurable improvements in both loss and latency, particularly on paths with poor transmission characteristics.
- The high degree of loss correlation (over 50%) on measured paths suggests that FEC schemes must add considerable protection or spread redundancy over a large window to avoid most losses. This may work for bulk data flow, but avoiding lower levels of loss is more important in interactive applications, where extra recovery delay is unacceptable.

### 5.3 Design Space and Internet Limitations

There are situations where redundant routing is not appropriate. Running unmodified bulk-flow TCP over a redundantly-enhanced path can lead to unfair bandwidth usage. However, running low-rate TCPs or applications that do not exceed their fair share of the channel might be acceptable.

In contrast, reactive overlay routing is suitable for most types of traffic, though its overhead may be prohibitive for low-bandwidth flows. For low-bandwidth flows, redundant approaches can offer similar benefits with lower overhead. For high-bandwidth flows, FEC approaches result in overhead proportional to the flow size, whereas alternate-path routing has constant overhead.

**Probe-based Reactive Routing:**
- Overhead grows rapidly with the network size but is independent of flow size.

**2-Redundant Mesh Routing:**
- Imposes a size-independent 2x overhead per packet.

### Best Expected Path and Independence Limits

- **Best Expected Path Limit:** Probing can only find the best network path at any given time. As probing frequency increases, performance asymptotically approaches the best expected path.
- **Capacity Limit:** Both schemes face a capacity limit. If the original data stream uses 100% of available capacity, neither scheme can improve. The slope of the capacity limit is negative, meaning greater gains require more bandwidth.
- **Independence Limit:** Redundant routing is ultimately limited by the loss and failure independence of the network. Without designing for path independence, having 50% of failures and losses occur independently is a reasonable upper limit.

### 6. Conclusions and Future Work

Overlay networks are becoming increasingly popular for deploying new Internet services, overcoming performance and resilience issues in the underlying Internet. We examined two techniques: probe-based reactive overlay routing and mesh routing. Our evaluation shows a reasonable but not large degree of loss and failure independence, such that about 40% of observed losses were avoidable. Many benefits of indirect routing could also be achieved by sending duplicate copies of packets with a 10 or 20 ms delay along the same path.

Future work should consider the impact of additional traffic on underlying loss rates and whether over-provisioning network capacity to support probing and meshing overhead would reduce losses. Additionally, exploring combinations of reactive and redundant routing to further reduce losses and de-correlate back-to-back packet losses would be valuable.
