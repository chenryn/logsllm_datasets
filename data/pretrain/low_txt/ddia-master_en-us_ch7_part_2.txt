If transactions can be executed very quickly and the transaction throughput is low enough to be processed on a single CPU core, this is a simple and effective solution.

### Two-Phase Locking
For decades, two-phase locking has been the standard method for implementing serializability. However, many applications avoid using it due to its performance characteristics.

### Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI)
Serializable snapshot isolation is a relatively new algorithm that mitigates most of the drawbacks of previous approaches. It employs an optimistic approach, allowing transactions to proceed without blocking. When a transaction attempts to commit, it is checked for serializability, and if it fails, the transaction is aborted.

The examples in this chapter use a relational data model. As discussed in "[The Need for Multi-Object Transactions](ch7.md#the-need-for-multi-object-transactions)", transactions are a valuable database feature, regardless of the data model used.

In this chapter, we explored ideas and algorithms primarily in the context of a database running on a single machine. Transactions in distributed databases present a new set of challenging issues, which will be discussed in the next two chapters.
