### Title: Black Hat US-19: The Future of Securing Intelligent Electronic Devices Using the IEC 62351-7 Standard for Monitoring

Until recently, passive monitoring has been the standard approach for Operational Technology (OT) networks due to the critical processes they support. However, as industrial organizations embrace Industry 4.0 and the increasing convergence of IT and OT, industrial infrastructure is now exposed to new, advanced threats from external sources. Addressing these threats requires more effective and efficient OT security solutions.

Today, there is a better understanding of OT devices and protocols, along with the availability of dedicated security monitoring protocols. Standards like IEC 62351 define network and system management data object models that can be used to monitor the health of networks and systems, detect potential security intrusions, and manage the performance and reliability of the information infrastructure. This enables industrial security systems to increase their environmental awareness by introducing active interaction with devices within the network.

This new approach opens up an unprecedented number of detection scenarios that were not possible before, leading to higher detection rates, better visibility during incidents, and a cost-effective solution for distributed environments. In this session, Nozomi Networks Co-founder and CPO Andrea Carcano, along with security researchers from Nozomi Networks Labs, will present a live coverage analysis of detecting threats using IEC 62351 and SNMP.
