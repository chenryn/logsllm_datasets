**Title: Black Hat US-19: Mobile Interconnect Threats - How Next-Gen Products May Already Be Outdated**

The concept of a "walled garden" once served as the primary security principle for SS7 (Signaling System 7) networks. However, this approach is no longer sufficient, and malicious actors are increasingly exploiting access to these networks to leverage various mobile network functions, such as geolocation, subscriber profile access, and communication interception.

In response, mobile network operators are deploying new equipment designed to detect and mitigate attacks, thereby protecting their customers. These next-generation solutions are expected to be robust against anomalous traffic and secure. In this talk, we will discuss the vulnerabilities we have discovered in these new systems and outline the key considerations when evaluating their security.
