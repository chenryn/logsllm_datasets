**Title: Before We Knew It: An Empirical Study of Zero-Day Attacks in the Real World**

**Authors: Leyla Bilge and Tudor Dumitras**

**Abstract**

Zero-day attacks, which exploit vulnerabilities not yet publicly disclosed, pose a significant threat to cybersecurity. These attacks are challenging to analyze due to the scarcity of available data before their discovery. In this paper, we present a method for automatically identifying zero-day attacks using field-gathered data from 11 million real hosts worldwide. By analyzing when benign and malicious binaries are downloaded, we identified 18 vulnerabilities exploited before disclosure, with 11 of these previously unknown. Our findings indicate that the average duration of a zero-day attack is 312 days, and after public disclosure, the volume of attacks exploiting these vulnerabilities can increase by up to five orders of magnitude.

**Introduction**

A zero-day attack exploits a vulnerability that has not been publicly disclosed. Such attacks are particularly dangerous because they can bypass traditional defenses, such as patching and signature-based detection. Cybercriminals often target popular software like Microsoft Office and Adobe Flash, making unpatched vulnerabilities highly valuable, with market values ranging from $5,000 to $250,000. Notable examples include the 2010 Hydraq trojan, the Stuxnet worm, and the 2011 RSA attack. However, little is known about the frequency, duration, and characteristics of zero-day attacks due to the lack of pre-discovery data.

Previous studies have relied on indirect measurements and post-mortem analyses, which do not provide a comprehensive understanding of zero-day attacks. This study aims to fill this gap by conducting a systematic analysis of zero-day attacks between 2008 and 2011 using the Worldwide Intelligence Network Environment (WINE), a platform for data-intensive experiments in cybersecurity. WINE collects data from 11 million real hosts, providing a unique opportunity to study the lifecycle of vulnerabilities and the impact of their disclosure.

**Findings and Implications**

- **Frequency and Duration:** We identified 18 vulnerabilities exploited before disclosure, with 11 previously unknown. The average duration of a zero-day attack is 312 days, with some lasting up to 30 months.
- **Detection and Impact:** Current policies and technologies are insufficient for timely detection of zero-day attacks. Most zero-day vulnerabilities are used in targeted attacks, affecting a small number of hosts, but a few high-profile attacks, like Stuxnet, have a broader impact.
- **Post-Disclosure Behavior:** After public disclosure, the number of malware variants exploiting these vulnerabilities increases by up to 85,000 times, and the number of attacks increases by up to 100,000 times. This highlights the need for rapid patching and the potential risks associated with full disclosure policies.

**Contributions**

- **Methodology:** We propose a method for automatically identifying zero-day attacks using field data from real hosts.
- **Empirical Analysis:** We conduct a systematic study of zero-day attacks, providing new insights into their characteristics and prevalence.
- **Policy Implications:** We discuss the implications of our findings for the policy of full disclosure and the need for more effective mitigation strategies.

**Organization of the Paper**

- **Section 2:** Definition of zero-day attacks and research goals.
- **Section 3:** Review of current knowledge and related work.
- **Section 4:** Description of our method for identifying zero-day attacks and the data sets analyzed.
- **Section 5:** Presentation of empirical results.
- **Section 6:** Discussion of the implications of our findings.

**Data Sets and Methodology**

We conducted our study using the Worldwide Intelligence Network Environment (WINE), a platform developed at Symantec Research Labs for sharing comprehensive field data with the research community. WINE samples and aggregates terabyte-sized data sets from a representative subset of hosts running Symantec products, such as Norton Antivirus. These hosts are real computers, not honeypots or lab machines, providing a realistic environment for our analysis.

Our method involves five steps:
1. **Building the Ground Truth:** Gathering information about vulnerabilities from databases like OSVDB and vendor advisories.
2. **Identifying Exploits in Executables:** Using Symantec’s Threat Explorer to link threats to their corresponding CVE identifiers.
3. **Analyzing the Presence of Exploits on the Internet:** Searching binary reputation data to estimate when and where malicious files appeared.
4. **Identifying Zero-Day Attacks:** Correlating the data to identify instances where malicious files were present before the corresponding vulnerability was disclosed.

**Conclusion**

This study provides new insights into the prevalence, duration, and impact of zero-day attacks. Our findings highlight the need for more effective detection and mitigation strategies, as well as a re-evaluation of the full disclosure policy. By leveraging large-scale field data, we can better understand and address the challenges posed by zero-day attacks in the real world.
