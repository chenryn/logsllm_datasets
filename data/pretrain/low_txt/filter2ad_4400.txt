## Abstract
Tor, with over 1.7 million daily users, is a large-scale anonymity network designed to protect user identities on the internet. It provides low-latency transmissions suitable for a wide range of applications, including web browsing, making it an accessible tool for a broad user base. However, its widespread use makes Tor a prime target for de-anonymization attacks. Recent research has demonstrated the existence of powerful traffic analysis attacks that can correlate traffic streams and identify users and their accessed content. A key challenge in the field of anonymity networks is developing efficient countermeasures against these attacks. These countermeasures must enhance the security of existing networks while maintaining acceptable performance to ensure continued widespread adoption.

This work analyzes mixing strategies as a potential countermeasure to traffic analysis attacks in Tor. Initial simulation results indicate the security benefits and performance trade-offs of three primary mixing strategies.

**Keywords:** Anonymity Networks, Mix, Tor

## 1. Introduction
When using the internet, we leave traces of personal information that can reveal sensitive details about our lives, potentially harming individuals who share political statements or act as whistleblowers. Anonymity networks, such as Tor, aim to protect this sensitive information by separating user identities from the content they access. With over 1.7 million daily users, Tor is a prominent example of a volunteer-operated anonymity network that offers strong security features like onion encryption and low-latency transmissions, making it suitable for interactive applications like web browsing.

However, this performance comes at the cost of vulnerabilities to traffic analysis attacks. Recent studies have identified both active [12, 8, 3] and passive [10, 15, 18] traffic analysis attacks that aim to de-anonymize users by monitoring transmission traces at different nodes in the network. The success of these attacks depends on two main factors:

1. **Attack Metrics:** Adversaries use specific metrics to identify relationships between monitored traffic streams. For example, in a confirmation attack, the adversary monitors the ingress traffic entering the network and the egress traffic between the last relay and the destination server. By detecting similarities in the ingress and egress traffic, the adversary can link the incoming and outgoing streams, thereby de-anonymizing the user.

2. **Controlled Nodes:** The number of nodes controlled by the adversary increases the likelihood of monitoring related connections. Routing attacks [1, 17, 16] can force connections to traverse compromised nodes, enhancing the adversary's ability to monitor and correlate traffic. An empirical study in 2016 [14] found that up to 40% of circuits in the Tor network are vulnerable to traffic analysis attacks if the adversary operates at the level of autonomous systems. For state-level adversaries or in cases of collusion, this vulnerability can increase to cover up to 85% of circuits, meaning that nearly half of Tor circuits are susceptible to de-anonymization attacks.

Traffic analysis attacks are possible because low-latency transmissions in Tor preserve packet relationships within a stream. Metadata such as inter-packet timing and packet counts can be analyzed to identify related streams. In contrast, classical mix networks [4] and anonymous remailers [5] disrupt these metadata relationships by introducing artificial delays, but this results in high latencies that prevent interactive applications. Thus, there is a trade-off between performance and security, with current systems either prioritizing latency-sensitive use cases or providing superior security features.

Given the current landscape of anonymity networks, the need for efficient countermeasures is evident. To address the vulnerabilities of Tor to traffic analysis attacks, we propose integrating mixing techniques into the transmission procedures of Tor relays. Unlike traditional mix networks, our approach limits additional delays to maintain acceptable performance rates while still disrupting the relationship between ingress and egress traces to protect against passive traffic analysis attacks.

In this poster, we present general mix concepts adapted for integration into Tor relays. We support the concept of low-latency mixing in Tor with initial simulation results that focus on the performance and security characteristics of different mixing strategies. Our main contributions include:

- **Identification and Analysis:** We identify and analyze three primary mixing strategies—batch mixing, continuous-time mixing, and dummy traffic injection—and evaluate their security and performance capabilities.
- **Simulation Results:** We provide simulation results that offer an initial impression of the efficiency of these mixing strategies under various parameter setups.
- **Experimental Setup:** We suggest an experimental setup for realistic measurements with the proposed mixing strategies, allowing for a performance and security analysis without compromising real Tor users.

Our proposed mixing concept is fully software-based and can be integrated into existing Tor relays. It is backward-compatible, meaning the mixing algorithm is self-contained and does not disrupt the transmissions of other relays that do not implement this new functionality. The mixing procedure is parametrized and can be adjusted to balance performance and security.

## 2. Countermeasures to Traffic Analysis Attacks
We focus on two primary design aspects for anonymity systems: security features and performance. Security features determine the expected protection against traffic analysis attacks, while performance limits the range of applications that can be served. Mix-based countermeasures for Tor are considered effective if they reduce the success of attacks, such as passive traffic analysis attacks, and maintain acceptable performance rates.

There are three abstract mix concepts that are candidate countermeasures in this context:

- **Batch Mixes [6, 5]:** Store all incoming packets at a node and flush a defined portion after a trigger event, such as a delay expiration or receiving a fixed number of packets.
- **Continuous-Time Mixes [9, 7]:** Assign individual (random) delays to packets, allowing for constant packet emission while disrupting the relationship between incoming and outgoing packets.
- **Dummy Traffic Injection [2, 15]:** Uses additional packets to perturb traffic streams. These injections do not carry meaningful payload data and disrupt patterns without relying on additional delays.

All three mix concepts can be adapted through individual parameters, such as injection rates for dummy packets, flush rates, or delay durations.

### Simulation Results
- **Figure 1:** Results for 1000 random repetitions comparing increasing insert rates for dummy traffic. We tested increasing insert rates (number of packets injected in a window) and increasing chaffing rates (number of windows affected by an injection).
- **Figure 2:** Results for 1000 random repetitions comparing two mixing concepts. Both mixes use a rate parameter \( r \) that denotes increasing delays.

These preliminary measurements help understand the dynamics of mixing and provide initial insights into the capabilities of individual mixing strategies. Based on these theoretical results, we can design an explicit mixing system that integrates with the current transmission procedures of Tor.

The results of both the abstract comparison of different mixing strategies and the explicit implementation of a mix for the Tor anonymity network will determine whether mixing can be used as a countermeasure to confirmation attacks.

## 3. Related Work
Mix networks were originally introduced by Chaum [4] to provide anonymous transmission of information at the cost of high latencies. In the original concept, a mix node gathers messages from multiple transmitters, stores them, and then forwards them to disrupt the relationship between incoming and outgoing traffic. Modern anonymity networks like Tor, however, establish relay circuits that forward onion-encrypted packets with low latencies, enabling interactive applications such as web browsing.

Low-latency transmissions come with vulnerabilities to traffic analysis attacks [12, 3, 11, 13, 15]. In these attacks, an adversary passively monitors ingress and egress traffic to de-anonymize users by correlating similarities in transmission metadata. Active attacks go further by interacting with transmissions, such as injecting identifiable fingerprints.

While much offensive work has been presented in recent years, there is a lack of realistic countermeasures to traffic analysis attacks, especially for open issues in the Tor network, which remains vulnerable to confirmation attacks. Given its large user base, Tor is a valuable target for such attacks, making the analysis of potential protection mechanisms even more critical.
