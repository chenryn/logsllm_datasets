### Methodology Overview

The methodology, as illustrated in Figure 1, can be considered a phase-oriented development approach that provides a structured platform for the development of business services. This process utilizes various models and techniques to guide the development, ensuring that each layer (strategic, business, logical, technical, and runtime) is supported from different perspectives.

#### Abstraction Layers and Artifacts

For each layer, we have developed key artifacts that are essential in the business service development process. These artifacts include important elements such as data, people, and rules. Models and methods, such as balanced scorecards, UML, mind maps, BPMN, BPEL, OWL, and OCL, are assigned to the intersection of an abstraction layer and one of these artifacts. Figure 2 illustrates the various layers of abstraction for business services.

### Definitions and Concepts

To ensure clarity and conceptual separation, we introduce a set of definitions for the terms "Service," "e-Service," and "Web Service."

#### Service
In business and economics, a service is the non-material equivalent of a good. It is an activity that is mostly intangible and is offered by a provider to its customers. A service is an act of economic nature rather than an operational action. Examples of traditional services include processing an insurance claim, typing a letter, and filling out a form.

#### e-Service
With the advent of the Internet, companies began using electronic information technologies to provide services that could be partially or fully automated. The term "e-service" (Rust and Kannan, 2003) was introduced to describe transactions conducted over the Internet, such as purchasing books, requesting services, and transmitting insurance claims electronically. We adopt the definition given by Hull et al. (2003): "An e-service is a collection of network-resident software services accessible via standardized protocols, whose functionality can be automatically discovered and integrated into applications or composed to form more complex services." E-services are a subset of services (Figure 3).

#### Web Service
Web services are e-services that are based on software or applications available on the Internet and are made accessible to end users using Web-based protocols or programs. There are three main types of Web services: RPC Web Services, SOA Web Services, and RESTful Web Services.

- **RPC Web Services**: Bring distributed programming functions and methods from the RPC world.
- **SOA Web Services**: Implement an architecture according to Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), where the basic unit of communication is a message.
- **RESTful Web Services**: Based on HTTP and use well-known operations like GET, PUT, and DELETE. They focus on interacting with stateful resources rather than messages or operations.

### Service Stack

The terms "Service," "e-Service," and "Web Service" are often used interchangeably but refer to related concepts from different domains. To better address the various stakeholders involved in architecting an enterprise-wide solution based on services, it is crucial to understand these distinctions.

### Conclusions

TEXO aims to support the vision of Future Business Value Networks (FBVN) by enabling IT-supported value networks via service ecosystems. Such networks will provide opportunities to create and drive a new "service industry" for producing, changing, adapting, (re)selling, and operating services. By providing a holistic approach, TEXO will contribute to the larger topic of a Web-based business service economy.
