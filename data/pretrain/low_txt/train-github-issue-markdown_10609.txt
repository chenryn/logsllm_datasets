I have observed an issue where a bound `CssClass` value is not being updated correctly after router navigation. Specifically, the old class value is not replaced by the new one during data binding. Instead, the new class is added next to the existing one, resulting in multiple classes being applied.

### Issue Description
- **Element:** `<a>` (Link)
- **Behavior:**
  - The class is updated correctly when initiated via a click event.
  - However, the class is not replaced when navigating using the Angular router.

### Reproduction Steps
1. **Successful Case:**
   - Click on any of the left navigation links.
   - Observe that the active link updates correctly (e.g., the Bootstrap "active" class is applied).

2. **Failure Case:**
   - Select any of the left navigation links other than the first element.
   - Click the 'About' link in the top navigation.
   - Click the 'Demo' link in the top navigation.
   - Observe that there are two highlighted links in the left navigation.

### Debugging Observations
- The correct functions are being called, but the class property is not being overwritten by the binding.

### Source Code

### Additional Information
- The class is being updated via a function, which works as expected when triggered by a click event.
- The issue specifically occurs during router navigation.

If you have any suggestions or solutions, please let me know.
