**Title: BlackHat US-19: Mobile Interconnect Threatsâ€”How Next-Gen Products May Already Be Outdated**

The concept of a "walled garden" once served as the foundational security principle for SS7 (Signaling System 7) networks. However, this is no longer the case. Attackers can now exploit access to these networks to leverage various mobile network functions, such as geolocation, access to subscriber profiles, and interception of communications. In response, mobile network operators are deploying new equipment designed to detect and mitigate attacks, thereby protecting their customers. These new solutions are expected to be robust against abnormal traffic and secure.

In this talk, we will discuss the vulnerabilities we have discovered in these next-generation products and the key factors we consider when assessing their security.
