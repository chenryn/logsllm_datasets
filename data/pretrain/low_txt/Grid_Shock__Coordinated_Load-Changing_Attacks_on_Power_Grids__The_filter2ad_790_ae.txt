### 3.1.2 Power Consumption and Attack Feasibility

The model under consideration requires significant power surges, effectively doubling the power consumption. We evaluated attacks with a load up to 3.5 times the reference incident of the continental synchronous grid, which is 10,500 MW in total. This represents less than 4% of the grid's total load, even during periods of lower network power, making our attacks more feasible.

Xu et al. [62] aimed to increase loads in IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS clouds to trip data centers' circuit breakers. The load increase was achieved by the adversary renting cloud services or using external web services to trigger computationally expensive operations. The authors sought to unplug a cloud provider’s data center but did not negatively impact the power grid itself. In contrast, our attacks aim to directly shut down the power grid or at least parts of it. Additionally, our attack load can consist of any controllable load, not limited to cloud-based loads.

### 8. Conclusion

Power grids are among the largest human-made control structures, predating large communication networks like the Internet by decades. Their successful, synchronized operation requires a constant balance between power supply and demand. Therefore, power providers maintain sophisticated models to forecast demand based on parameters such as time of day, season, and weather conditions. These models assume that fluctuations caused by individual consumers are averaged out on a macro scale, meaning for every consumer turning a light bulb off, another one turns it on. In our scenario, an adversary builds (or rents) a botnet of zombie computers and modulates their power consumption, e.g., by utilizing CPU, GPU, screen brightness, and laser printers in a coordinated manner. By outpacing the grid’s countermeasures, the grid is pushed into an unstable state, triggering automated load shedding or tie line tripping due to under-frequency.

We developed three different attacks against the power grid and analyzed their feasibility. First, we investigated the dynamics and increase of different loads, particularly regarding PCs and IoT devices. We found that CPUs, GPUs, and screens can have a controllable load increase of 100 W or more, while printers and IoT devices can reach 1,000 W or more. In the second step, we simulated the impact of load attacks on grid stability, as testing these attacks on a real power grid is infeasible for various reasons. Under favorable conditions, i.e., low total network power and a high share of inverter-connected renewables feeding power into the grid, 4,500 MW of additional load is sufficient to destabilize the system and trigger load shedding. In the European continental synchronous grid area, these conditions typically occur at night or on public holidays with high wind power supply. According to our computations, an adversary would need a botnet of 2.5 to 9.8 million bots (Table 5). While this is not feasible in most cases, it might be worthwhile for nation-scale attacks.

Although terminology and details differ between synchronous grids worldwide, the general principles and conclusions are applicable to all AC power grids. Our attacks can be adapted to work in any of these grids, though minor adjustments may be necessary.
