### Results

In this section, we present the results obtained using UltraSAN. The results from ETMCC are highly consistent with those from UltraSAN.

#### PD>OD Analysis
Figure 5 illustrates the difference between the two models when \( P_E = 5.0 \times 10^{-4} \) and for various values of OD ranging from 0 to 8. It is evident that Model B estimates a lower probability of error compared to Model A. As expected, in both models, the higher the value of OD, the lower the probability of errors.

#### PUM Analysis
Figure 6 presents several results for the property PUM, using the parameters P and Q, and the rate of the exponential distribution of the timed activity as described in Section 4. The results were obtained for \( P_E = 1.6 \times 10^{-4} \) and resilience (res) varying between 0 and 3. The upper two curves represent the results for TCFP equal to 2400 seconds, with the upper curve corresponding to Model A and the lower curve to Model B. The third curve from the top shows experimental data from a similar setting reported in [9]. The value for res = 3 was zero, making it difficult to establish with sufficient precision in Figure 6. Below the third curve, two additional curves show the results for Model A and Model B, respectively, but for TCFP equal to 2400 milliseconds, similar to those reported in [4]. The bottom curve represents the results from an earlier model by Coccoli et al. [9], which did not consider the correlation between communication failures due to fading effects. The largest models used for the quantitative analysis consisted of 660 states and 3135 transitions for Model A and 13260 states and 43320 transitions for Model B, both for four stations, OD = 8, and in reduced base model format. For more details, refer to [17].

### Discussion

It is clear that neither Model A nor Model B for PUM exactly match the experimental data, although Model B provides a better approximation than Model A. For small values of res (i.e., res = 0 or res = 1), both models overestimate the probability of error. However, the predictions improve for higher values of res (res = 2), even though there is insufficient experimental data to make a well-informed judgment. One possible explanation is that the correlation between transmission errors during the experiments was lower than assumed in the model. Alternatively, user messages may be retransmitted only once per round, making them less susceptible to the bursty nature of a fading channel. In other words, the loss of user messages is less correlated than, for example, the loss of consecutive decision messages. Unfortunately, the number of losses of decision messages has not been experimentally established.

Despite these discrepancies, Model B is preferred over the earlier model developed in [9] that did not account for fading effects. The earlier model significantly underestimates the error probabilities [9].

### Conclusions

In this paper, we revisited an earlier dependability analysis of a variant of the centralized medium access protocol of the IEEE 802.11 standard for wireless local area networks [8]. We analyzed some of the models used in that work from both a behavioral (qualitative) and a dependability (quantitative) perspective using the prototype stochastic model checker ETMCC. Both qualitative and quantitative properties were formalized using Continuous Stochastic Logic (CSL).

The qualitative analysis of the concurrent behavior of the models revealed a discrepancy between the expected behavior and the actual behavior. The use of model checking allowed for the clear and unambiguous specification and verification of the desired behavioral properties. Some of these properties concerned state sequences, which can generally only be analyzed indirectly by means of path-automata using current state-of-the-art dependability analysis tools such as UltraSAN or Möbius [6]. Extending these tools with (stochastic) model checking capabilities would enable model developers to assess the often intricate concurrent behavior of dependability models.

Based on the results of the qualitative analysis, we developed a new model that more accurately reflects the assumed synchronization aspects of the protocol, induced by the concept of broadcasts within single slots and rounds of the protocol.

Two of the main dependability measures, introduced informally in [8], were formalized as formulas of Continuous Stochastic Logic and assessed using the stochastic model checker ETMCC. The results corresponded very well when on-the-fly steady-state analysis in ETMCC was turned off, which can be attributed to the stiffness of the models under analysis.

We believe that this paper provides further evidence of the potential advantages of integrating (stochastic) model checking capabilities with advanced tools for model-based dependability and performance analysis, and its application to realistic case studies.

In this paper, we have discussed only a part of the interesting properties and models for the analysis of the real-time wireless protocol. Our future research aims at a more complete formal analysis of the protocol, using proper abstraction techniques and forms of compositionality to address further qualitative and quantitative properties in a coherent and systematic way.
