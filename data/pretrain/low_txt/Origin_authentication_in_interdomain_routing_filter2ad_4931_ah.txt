### Discrete Authentication and Delegation

Authenticated delegation lists are significantly more expensive than other schemes because each UPDATE must be accompanied by a complete proof. Most delegations are made by a few entities, resulting in naturally large proofs. In contrast, other proofs are relatively constant in size and smaller compared to authenticated delegation lists.

Offline bandwidth costs are minimal. No period consumed more than 100k of bandwidth for any construction, with most periods using less than 10k. This is reasonable since very few proofs (tens) are validated in any given period. The only exception was a spike of several hundred kilobytes of data associated with simple proofs and the authenticated tree scheme. This spike was due to a large block of deaggregated addresses, requiring the verifier to continually acquire (but not verify) many proofs.

### Caching Performance

A third set of tests evaluated the degree to which caching can improve performance. The delegation graph defined in the preceding section contains 114,183 delegations. Caching all proofs for these delegations requires 13.4M cache for simple attestations, 1.2M for authenticated delegation lists, 4.0M for AS authenticated delegation lists, and 4.7M for authentication delegation trees.

Figures 6 and 7 show the computational costs associated with each scheme under varying cache sizes over a two-hour period (4:40pm-9pm). A 100 megabyte cache far exceeds the size of the proofs, measuring only new proofs (starting with a cold cache at midnight). Medium-sized caches (1M and 100k) are affected by reference locality. The most notable aspect of these graphs is the superior performance of the tree scheme, attributed to the structure of the delegation graph and the use of succinct proofs. Since 16 proofs encompass 80% of the delegations, their signatures are likely to be present in the cache. The size of the succinct proofs ensures they remain in the cache.

After removing the load associated with organization-to-AS delegation (the leaf delegation in the graph), authenticated delegation lists outperformed AS authenticated delegation lists. This is due to delegation density: an AS is likely to see many delegations from a single organization within some temporal bounds, regardless of the delegatee. This demonstrates that delegator-centric solutions are well-suited to current BGP UPDATE traffic.

These results suggest a new cache strategy for aggregate proof schemes: caching only organization-to-organization delegation proof signatures. A complete cache of these signatures would be just over 200 kilobytes. Verification would perform as if all proofs were previously cached, significantly reducing computational cost. This mitigates the thrashing effect of large proof approaches on small caches. However, since tree-based solutions already offer near-optimal caching, this strategy would provide little added benefit. We will consider these and other strategies (e.g., LFU caching disciplines) in future work.

### Approximation Sensitivity

Assume our approximation of the delegation graph is entirely incorrect, with frequent changes and no high-degree nodes (low delegation density). This would indicate highly fluid and fragmented address space ownership, contrary to most BGP studies and signaling larger interdomain routing problems. Such features would increase BGP table sizes, load, and prevent timely convergence, making aggregation useless. This scenario is unlikely.

Assuming we have underestimated the number of ownership sources and delegations, which is almost certainly true, operational evidence suggests that further address space delegation is infrequent. Thus, our approximation is of sufficient quality to draw general conclusions. A larger body of ownership sources and delegations would quantitatively but not qualitatively affect our results. Lesser delegation densities would close the performance gap between designs, while a larger number of delegations would scale up resource costs for all schemes. The wide gap in measured costs indicates that even a gross approximation sufficiently characterizes the constructions.

### Conclusions

The lack of security in interdomain routing protocols is increasingly recognized as a critical issue. Origin authentication services trace and validate the delegation of address usage from authorities to organizations and ultimately to ASes. Previous works have identified simple solutions, but none have defined and generalized origin authentication or evaluated solutions using a complete picture of Internet delegation.

This paper develops a broad understanding of the issues, designs, and practicality of origin authentication services. Our work includes formalization, modeling, and simulation. We formalized the semantics of address advertisements and proofs of delegation, defining broad classes of origin authentication services by extending existing cryptographic proof systems. An analysis of the address delegation graph shows that current delegation on the Internet is largely static and dense, with 16 entities performing 80% of the address delegation. The OAsim simulator uses our approximate delegation graph and BGP announcements to compute resource consumption. Simulation experiments show that resource costs can be significantly reduced by using proof systems centered on delegator organizations and ASes, potentially reducing costs by up to an order of magnitude over proposed solutions. These results indicate that online origin authentication may now be feasible.

Securing the current interdomain routing infrastructure will be a lengthy process. The security and networking communities must continually reevaluate the assumptions and environments upon which solutions are based. Work such as this contributes to this process by providing a thorough understanding of the trade-offs inherent to these services, grounded in the current realities of the Internet. It is through the cumulative force of this and similar works that the energy barrier of interdomain routing security can be breached.
