### The Internet: A Space of Freedom?
Once upon a time, the internet was believed to be a space of freedom where:
- All opinions were allowed.
- News was free.
- No one controlled the internet.
- Neutrality and anonymity prevailed.
- There were no rules.

We lived in the age of Aquarius, where our biggest problem was trolls, and we managed them as cultured people. However, things have changed.

### The Reality
- **4nOym0us and HBGary Ownage:**
  - Backdoors (e.g., Task B and 12 Monkeys)
  - Fake Facebook profiles
  - Viral propaganda on the internet

- **Internet Vulnerabilities:**
  - Network connections (e.g., Great Firewall of China, BGP attacks in Egypt)
  - DNS systems (e.g., WikiLeaks.org, Rojadirecta.org)
  - Laws (every country has its own, plus international laws)

- **Spain's Political Climate:**
  - Politicians and their policies

### How to Disrupt Communication
- **Goal:** Disconnect your audience.
- **Methods:**
  - Taking control of the system (owning the system)
  - Making it unavailable (DOS attacks)
  - Making it unlocatable (closing domain names)
  - Blocking service accounts (Facebook, Twitter, Google)
  - Infosec war (banning from web searchers)
  - Using legal measures

### Solutions and Workarounds
- **OpenNIC**
- **P2P DNS**
- **OSIRIS CMS**

### What Happens If...
- **Surveillance:** Your RSS is under surveillance.
- **Policy Changes:** Be cautious about what you say, as policies can change.

### From Blogger to Reader
- **Domain Name:** Browsing the web.
- **RSS Subscriptions:** Readers connected to the XML feed.
- **Author:**
  - Blogger system account
  - Domain name
  - HTTP RSS feed
  - FeedBurner

- **If Your Blog Is Taken Down:**
  - You can change the feed, but if you use FeedBurner, you may lose access.
