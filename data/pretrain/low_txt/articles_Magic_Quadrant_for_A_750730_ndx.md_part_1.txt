#### Market Definition/Description

Gartner's view is focused on transformational technologies or approaches that meet the future needs of end users, rather than the current market landscape.

Gartner defines the APM and observability market as software that enables the observation and analysis of application health, performance, and user experience. The primary users are IT operations, site reliability engineers, cloud and platform ops, application developers, and product owners. These solutions can be deployed self-hosted, as vendor-managed hosted environments, or via software as a service (SaaS).

The capabilities of APM and observability tools include:
- **Complete transactional behavior observation**: Monitoring an application’s full transactional behavior.
- **Automated discovery and mapping**: Automated discovery and mapping of an application and its infrastructure components, including cloud services.
- **Cross-platform monitoring**: Monitoring applications running on mobile (native and browser) and desktop browsers.
- **Performance problem identification and analysis**: Identifying and analyzing application performance issues and their impact on business outcomes.
- **Integration with automation and service management tools**: Native integration with automation and service management tools, as well as public cloud providers like AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitoring, and Google Cloud Operations.
- **Business KPI and user journey analysis**: Analyzing business key performance indicators (KPIs) and user journeys, such as from login to checkout.
- **Interactive telemetry interrogation**: Interactive interrogation of multiple telemetry types (traces, metrics, and logs) to detect “unknown unknowns” and identify underlying issues.
- **Application security functionality**: Security features delivered via a common agent or framework for APM.

Optional functionalities may include:
- **Endpoint monitoring**: Understanding the user experience and its impact on business outcomes.
- **VDI monitoring**: Support for virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) monitoring.
- **Performance testing**: Integration with load testing tools.
