### HTTP URLs of Rendered Archived Visits

When rendering archived snapshots through a browser, some dynamic requests might be generated in real time. For example, a Google Analytics URL can be clearly distinguished from an archived URL by the presence of the domain `archive.org` in the URL.

**Example (Table 12):** A snapshot captured during a watering hole attack, evident from the request to the malicious IP `74.207.254.87`. At the time `archive.org` attempted to crawl the malicious request, it was already taken down, so the subsequent malicious requests described in the report [53] were not observed. However, the beginning of the compromise chain (i.e., the request to `http://74.207.254.87`) was captured since the Forbes home page was still compromised at the time of the archive crawling.

| Type              | URL                                                                                  | Comment                                      |

### Archive Data Collection

We searched `archive.org` for a target list of 121,651 Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) and collected over 1 million archive URLs. Unfortunately, many URLs had only one snapshot, and most differed only in URL arguments or file names. For example, forum websites like `linuxforums.org` have unique URLs for each post, where the post ID is passed as part of the file name. However, all posts (with different URLs) generate similar HTTP traffic once visited, as they use the same content management system and styling templates (e.g., vBulletin).

To correlate visits to these URLs and observe changes from multiple snapshots, we generalized URLs by removing their parameters and file names when the URLs contained the same paths, as illustrated in Table 11. In our study, we collected such generalized archive URLs for 61,000 FQDNs from the identified potential targets. The remaining domains either never appeared in the archives or had fewer than 10 snapshots, making them unsuitable for profiling or monitoring.

We further implemented a dynamic crawler as a Firefox extension and deployed it to several Virtual Machines (VMs). Our crawlers were instrumented to crawl the collected list of archive URLs and capture all rendered HTTP requests generated from the visits. In addition to this archive HTTP traffic, we conducted real-time monitoring of a small number of manually selected FQDNs. A summary of the collected archive HTTP traffic is provided in Table 2.
