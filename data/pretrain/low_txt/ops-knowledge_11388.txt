I recently installed PyDev 1.5.3 on my EasyEclipse 1.3.1 setup, with the intention of integrating the merged version of PyDev Extensions into the core PyDev. However, after this update, I found that certain comparison operations, such as "Compare with > Base revision," no longer functioned correctly. To resolve the issue, I had to disable PyDev 1.5.3 and revert to the pre-installed PyDev 1.3.13, which is included in EasyEclipse 1.3.1.

Has anyone else encountered a similar problem? Are there any known workarounds for this issue?

**Update:**
I have since upgraded to PyDev 1.5.6, and it is now working seamlessly with EasyEclipse, even when used alongside Subclipse. The issues with file comparisons appear to have been resolved, and the new diff view in PyDev 1.5.6 is notably more visually appealing than in previous versions.
