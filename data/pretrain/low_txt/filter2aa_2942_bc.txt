### Development Practices and Security Measures

- **Security Training for Developers**: Developers are trained in secure development practices and instructed on the use of vulnerability tools to ensure that the software they develop is secure.
- **Evaluation of Reused System Components**: Ensure that all reused system components, whether developed internally or sourced from open-source projects, are evaluated as part of a standard process for known vulnerabilities (Ref. SA-15).
- **System Component Inventory**: Maintain a comprehensive inventory of system components to support the maintenance of the software product throughout its lifecycle (Ref. CM-8).
- **Continuous Vulnerability Monitoring**: Continuously monitor system components for emerging vulnerabilities and ensure that appropriate processes are in place for prompt remediation once a fix is available. Automate this process where possible (Ref. CA-7, RA-5).

### Estimated Costs of Mitigation Strategies
- **Developer Training**: $500,000 - $800,000
- **System Component Inventory Process**: $1.2 million - $1.5 million
- **Continuous Monitoring of System Component Vulnerabilities**: $800,000 - $1.2 million

### Appendix D: C-SCRM Templates

#### 1. C-SCRM Strategy and Implementation Plan
To address cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain, enterprises develop a C-SCRM strategy. This strategy, accompanied by an implementation plan, is at the enterprise level (Level 1). Different mission and business areas (Level 2) may tailor the C-SCRM strategy to address specific needs, as outlined at the enterprise level. The C-SCRM strategy and implementation plan should align with the overarching enterprise risk management strategy and comply with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, and regulations.

**Typical Components**:
- Strategic approaches to reducing supply chain risk exposure
- Enterprise-wide risk management requirements
- Ownership
- Risk tolerance
- Roles and responsibilities
- Escalation criteria

The strategy and implementation plan may be developed as a single document or split into multiple documents, but they should be closely related.

#### 1.1. C-SCRM Strategy and Implementation Plan Template

**1.1.1. Purpose**
- **Outline the purpose**: Provide a strategic roadmap for implementing effective C-SCRM capabilities, practices, processes, and tools within the enterprise, aligned with the enterprise’s mission, vision, and values.
- **Document Placement**: Describe where the strategy and implementation document resides relative to other C-SCRM documentation.
- **Direction and Priorities**: Provide clear direction around the enterprise’s C-SCRM priorities and its general approach for achieving those priorities.

**Sample Text**:
"The purpose of this strategy and implementation document is to provide a strategic roadmap for implementing effective C-SCRM capabilities, practices, processes, and tools within the enterprise in support of its vision, mission, and values. The strategic approach is organized around a set of objectives that span the scope of the enterprise’s mission and reflect a phased, achievable, strategic approach to ensuring the successful implementation and effectiveness of C-SCRM efforts across the enterprise."

**Core Functions and Responsibilities**:
- Discuss necessary core functions, roles, responsibilities, and the approach for implementing C-SCRM capabilities.
- Incorporate mission and business policies and system plans as attachments.
- Periodically review all three tiers of documentation to ensure cohesion and consistency.

**Foundation and Expansion**:
- Establish a core foundational capability with baseline functions such as defining policies, ownership, and dedicated resources.
- Raise awareness and ensure proper training to understand and perform C-SCRM functions.
- Acknowledge dependencies on industry-wide coordination and update the strategy and operational implementation plans as needed.

**1.1.2. Authority and Compliance**
- List the laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines governing the C-SCRM strategy and implementation.

**Sample Text**:
- **Legislation**: 
  - Strengthening and Enhancing Cyber-capabilities by Utilizing Risk Exposure Technology Act (SECURE) Technology of 2018
  - Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014
  - Section 889 of the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act
  - Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
  - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
  - Executive Order 14028 of May 12, 2021, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity
- **Regulations**:
  - NYDFS 23 NYCRR 500: Section 500.11 Third Party Service Provider Security Policy
  - CIP-013-1: Cyber Security – Supply Chain Risk Management
  - FFIEC Information Security Handbook II.C.20: Oversight of Third-Party Service Providers
- **Guidelines**:
  - NIST 800-53, Revision 5: CA-5, SR-1, SR-2, SR-3
  - NIST 800-37, Revision 2
  - NIST 800-161, Revision 1: Appendix C
  - ISO 28000:2007

**1.1.3. Strategic Objectives**
- Strategic objectives establish the foundation for determining enterprise-level C-SCRM controls and requirements.
- Each objective supports the achievement of the enterprise’s stated purpose in pursuing sound C-SCRM practices and risk-reducing outcomes.

**Sample Text**:
- **Objective 1**: Effectively manage cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain.
- **Objective 2**: Serve as a trusted source of supply for customers.
- **Objective 3**: Position the enterprise as an industry leader in C-SCRM.

**1.1.4. Implementation Plan and Progress Tracking**
- Outline the methodology and milestones for tracking the progress of the enterprise’s C-SCRM strategic objectives.
- Define prioritized time horizons using a "crawl, walk, run" approach.
- Include an issue escalation process and feedback mechanism to drive changes to the implementation plan and progress tracking.

**Sample Text**:
"[The enterprise’s] execution of its C-SCRM strategic objectives and the sustained operational effectiveness of underlying activities require a formal approach and commitment to progress tracking. [The enterprise] will track and assess implementation of its strategic objectives by defining subsidiary milestones and implementation dates in an implementation plan. Monitoring and reporting on elements of the implementation plan require shared responsibilities across multiple disciplines and a cross-enterprise, team-based approach."

**Implementation Milestones**:
- **Table D-1**: Objective 1 – Implementation milestones to effectively manage cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain.
- **Table D-2**: Objective 2 – Implementation milestones for serving as a trusted source of supply for customers.
- **Table D-3**: Objective 3 – Implementation milestones to position the enterprise as an industry leader in C-SCRM.

**1.1.5. Roles and Responsibilities**
- Designate those responsible for the Strategy and Implementation template, as well as its key components.

This structured and detailed approach ensures that the C-SCRM strategy and implementation plan are comprehensive, aligned with the enterprise’s goals, and supported by clear roles and responsibilities.
