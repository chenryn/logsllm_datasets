**ATT&CK ID:** S0127  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** BBSRAT

**Description:**
BBSRAT has been deployed via DLL side-loading, leveraging a legitimate Citrix executable. This executable is configured to persist by adding an entry to the Registry Run key at `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` with the value `ssonsvr.exe`.

This method allows the malware to execute automatically whenever the system starts, ensuring persistence on the infected machine.
