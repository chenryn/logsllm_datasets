### Speed Calculation and Measurement
Speed is calculated as the total number of IP lookup requests divided by the total lookup time. We used the Nvidia Visual Profiler tool to measure the lookup latency.

### Evaluation of IP Lookup Speed vs. Traffic Size
We evaluated the IP lookup speed in relation to the traffic size, defined as the number of IP addresses in one batch of data sent from the CPU to the GPU. We generated three traffic traces of different sizes: 30K, 60K, and 90K IP addresses. The results are shown in Figure 13. Our observations indicate that larger traffic sizes lead to higher lookup speeds. Specifically:
- For a traffic size of 30K, SAIL L achieves a lookup speed of 257-322 Mpps.
- For a traffic size of 60K, SAIL L achieves a lookup speed of 405-447 Mpps.
- For a traffic size of 90K, SAIL L achieves a lookup speed of 442-547 Mpps.

### Evaluation of IP Lookup Latency vs. Traffic Size
We also evaluated the IP lookup latency in relation to the traffic size. The results are shown in Figure 14. Our observations indicate that larger traffic sizes lead to higher lookup latencies. Specifically:
- For a traffic size of 30K, SAIL L has a lookup latency of 90-124 μs.
- For a traffic size of 60K, SAIL L has a lookup latency of 110-152 μs.
- For a traffic size of 90K, SAIL L has a lookup latency of 122-185 μs.

### Evaluation on Many-core Platform
We evaluated the lookup speed of SAIL L in relation to the number of cores using the many-core platform Telera TLR4-03680. Our experimental results show that the lookup rate increases linearly as the number of cores grows. Note that we only have results for 35 cores, as one core is responsible for traffic distribution and results collection. Figure 15 shows the results for FIB rrc00 using prefix-based traffic. Similar results were observed for other FIBs.

### Discussion
Our SAIL framework is primarily designed for IPv4 lookup but can be extended for IPv6 lookup. An IPv6 address consists of 128 bits, with the first 64 bits representing the network address and the remaining 64 bits representing the host address. An IPv6 prefix has 64 bits. Real-world IPv6 FIBs in backbone routers, as seen on www.ripe.net, typically contain around 14,000 entries, which is much smaller than IPv4 FIBs. To handle IPv6 FIBs, we can push trie nodes to six levels: 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, and 64. We perform the splitting on level 48, storing the bit map and chunk ID arrays of levels 16, 24, 32, 40, and the bit map array of level 48 in on-chip memory. Our experimental results show that the on-chip memory required for an IPv6 FIB is about 2.2 MB. Although the on-chip memory usage for IPv6 is larger in the worst case due to longer prefix lengths, the overall memory usage is similar to that for IPv4 because IPv6 FIBs are significantly smaller.

### Conclusion
In this paper, we make three key contributions:
1. **Two-Dimensional Splitting Approach**: We propose a two-dimensional splitting approach to IP lookup, which allows us to solve the sub-problem of finding prefixes ≤ 24 in on-chip memory of bounded small size.
2. **Algorithms for IP Lookup**: We propose a suite of algorithms based on our SAIL framework. These algorithms achieve constant and small IP lookup times and on-chip memory usage. They are cross-platform, as the data structures are all arrays and require only four operations: ADD, SUBTRACTION, SHIFT, and logical AND.
3. **Implementation and Evaluation**: We implemented our algorithms on four platforms (FPGA, CPU, GPU, and many-core) and conducted extensive experiments using real FIBs and traffic from a major ISP in China. Our results show that SAIL algorithms are several times or even two orders of magnitude faster than well-known IP lookup algorithms. We have open-sourced our SAIL L algorithm and three well-known IP lookup algorithms (LC-trie, Tree Bitmap, and Lulea).
