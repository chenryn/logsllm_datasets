### Distance Bounding and Location Verification

The prover broadcasts his response to all verifiers, constituting a many-to-one challenge-response round in the underlying distance bounding protocol. In this case, the protocol used is the original suggestion by Brands and Chaum [4]. The authors provide a proof that their scheme achieves "maximal security" for any location verification schemes based solely on time-of-flight.

Despite this proof, the scheme remains vulnerable to Location Hijacking (Figure 14). The proof in [6] establishes that the prover must be at the claimed location (within some accuracy) to correctly respond to challenges. However, it does not address the authentication of the node at the claimed location, leaving this responsibility to the underlying distance bounding protocol. Since the underlying protocol is susceptible to Distance Hijacking, the location verification protocol inherits this vulnerability. While an alternative distance bounding protocol could potentially be used to achieve a secure scheme, this example demonstrates that even recent location verification schemes with proofs of optimal security can be vulnerable to Location Hijacking.

### Related Work

#### Distance Bounding for RFID Tags

Avoine et al. [1] present a framework for analyzing RFID distance bounding protocols, defining three main attack types and Impersonation Fraud, where a "lonely prover purports to be another one" [1, p. 5], violating weak authentication. They consider these four attack types in both black-box and white-box prover models, resulting in eight security notions. None of their models cover Distance Hijacking attacks.

Dürholz et al. [10] propose the first computational formal framework for proving properties of RFID distance bounding protocols based on shared symmetric keys. Their framework considers an attacker interacting with a single prover (the tag) and a single verifier (the reader). Consequently, proving security in their framework does not guarantee the absence of Distance Hijacking attacks.

#### Formal Models for Distance Bounding

Meadows et al. [18] developed a formal methodology to prove properties of distance bounding protocols. However, because their methodology is not well-suited for dealing with dishonest provers, they did not consider scenarios that would detect Distance Hijacking attacks.

Malladi et al. [25] and Basin et al. [3] are the first formal approaches for distance bounding protocols that consider multi-prover scenarios and dishonest provers. Malladi et al. propose a tool-supported framework for analyzing distance bounding protocols, modeling a variant of the first signature-based protocol by Brands and Chaum. They analyze this protocol in several scenarios and find an attack that falls into our class of Distance Hijacking attacks.

Basin et al. [3] analyze a family of distance bounding protocols proposed by Meadows et al. [18] and identify an attack that we classify as Distance Hijacking, which they refer to as an "impersonation attack." They prove that a concatenation-based version of the protocol is secure in their framework, but it remains vulnerable to Distance Hijacking attacks using overshadowing in our extended framework.

### Location Hijacking

Location Hijacking occurs when a dishonest prover exploits one or more honest parties to provide false information about the location of the prover to a set of verifiers (Definition 6). This threat is magnified in location verification, as multiple distance bounding results are combined. For example, in Figure 15, a dishonest prover can combine Distance Hijacking attacks on multiple honest provers to make his location appear to be at any intersection of the distances of the honest provers, even if no one is actually present at that location.

### Case Study: Chiang et al. Protocol

To emphasize the relevance of Location Hijacking, we provide a brief case study of a recent protocol by Chiang et al. [6] that is vulnerable to Location Hijacking. In this protocol, a prover sends a location claim and receives simultaneous challenges from verifiers. The prover's response constitutes one round of the distance bounding protocol. Despite the proof of security, the protocol is still vulnerable to Location Hijacking due to the underlying distance bounding protocol's susceptibility to Distance Hijacking.

### Multi-Protocol Attacks

The multi-protocol Distance Hijacking attack described in Section VI resembles the Chosen Protocol (or Multi-Protocol) attack in cryptographic protocol analysis, introduced by Kelsey, Schneier, and Wagner [13]. In a traditional Dolev-Yao setting, Multi-Protocol attacks require shared key infrastructure, which can be mitigated by using different keys. However, in the context of distance measurement, the phase must be treated as a security primitive, and unexpected interactions can occur if not carefully managed. Multi-protocol Distance Hijacking poses a more significant threat in practice because only a few different hardware components for distance measurement are likely to be manufactured, which may be used by many different protocols.

### Conclusions

Distance Hijacking attacks pose a serious threat in many practical scenarios, including those where Terrorist Fraud attacks are not a concern. Surprisingly, this type of attack has not been considered in the analysis of proposed distance bounding protocols until now. Our analysis shows that many distance bounding protocols cannot be safely used in scenarios with multiple provers. Fortunately, adapting these protocols to be resilient against such attacks is possible without imposing significant overhead. Similar observations apply to location verification protocols concerning Location Hijacking attacks.

We introduced an extended framework to reason about distance bounding protocols symbolically, incorporating bit-level message manipulations by the attacker. This hybrid approach has been promising, enabling us to detect more attacks, including Distance Hijacking, and prove the absence of the attacks we found.

We proposed an exhaustive classification of attacks on distance bounding protocols, including new names and definitions for the three classical attack types. Our new attack names are more descriptive and less generic than previous ones. We hope this classification will positively impact the systematic analysis of threats against distance bounding protocols.

Secure functioning in a context with multiple provers is a desirable feature, giving an edge to protocols resilient against Distance Hijacking attacks. It is prudent to analyze new proposals for distance bounding protocols for their vulnerability to Distance Hijacking.
