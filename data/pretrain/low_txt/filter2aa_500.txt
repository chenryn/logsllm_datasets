# Presentation: LTE and 3G Modem Security

## Introduction
- **Topic:** This presentation is not about LTE vulnerabilities.
- **No Cables Needed:** Why isn't it working?
- **Title:** Scared Poopless – LTE and *Your* Laptop
- **Disclaimer:** During the slides, you will be exposed to hacker stock photos from the internet.

## Demo
- **What Did I Just See?**
- **This Is Not a Problem.**
- **Remember Kids!**
  - This is why you should do secure firmware updates.
  - **NEVER FORGET**

## Background
- **Internal LTE/3G Modems and Their Users:**
  - Business class devices
  - How are they plugged in?
    - PCIe ×2, SATA, USB 2.0 and 3.0, Audio, PCM, IUM, SSIC, and I2C
    - USB?!
  - **Why Hack This Device?**
    - Module available worldwide
    - It’s plugged in [INSIDE] your laptop/tablet
    - **Software:**
      - Windows utility for firmware updates
    - **Firmware:**
      - Packed in software utility
      - Strings is useful
    - **Hardware:**
      - Test pads?

## Exploitation
- **Got Root Shell!**
  - Happy shell dance
  - **Obligatory Success Meme:**
    - We have root shell on a Linux-run, independent device inside the physical platform.

## Firmware Structure
- **File Header:**
  - 92-byte file header
  - 98-byte object header
  - dword at offset 0x5E: object block size
  - word at offset 0x5C: object header CRC
  - dword at offset 0x18: object data size
- **Data Block 0:**
  - word at offset 0x00: data block 0 CRC
  - word at offset 0x02: data block 1 CRC
  - word at offset N*2: data block N CRC
- **Data Block N:**
  - 98-byte object header
  - dword at offset 0x5E: object block size
  - word at offset 0x5C: object header CRC
  - dword at offset 0x18: object data size
  - word at offset 0x00: data block 0 CRC
  - word at offset 0x02: data block 1 CRC
  - word at offset N*2: data block N CRC

## Data Size Relationships
- **CRC Value/Data Correspondence**

## Updater Patch
- **Updater Checks CRC:**
  - Updater calculates the correct CRC and compares it to the one in the firmware image.
  - Modify updater code to save the correct CRC in the image instead of comparing it.
  - Total op code change = 6 (not including NOP padding)

## Summary
- **We Had a Cool Demo!**
- **There Is Such a Thing as an Insider Threat, Literally.**
- **Secure Your Firmware Updates.**

## Questions
- **Any Questions?**
