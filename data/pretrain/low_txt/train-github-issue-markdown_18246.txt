### Description
One of the key pieces of information we need is the duration of tasks. Currently, this data can be obtained by hovering over the `Gantt` chart or using the `Task Duration` chart. It would be beneficial to have the data from the `Gantt` chart or the `Task Duration` chart presented in a table format for easier access and readability.

### Use Case/Motivation
The current visual representations (plots) make it more difficult to quickly find and compare task durations compared to a tabular format. A table view would provide a more straightforward and accessible way to view and analyze this data.
