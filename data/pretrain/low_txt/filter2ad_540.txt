## Abstract
The rapid advancement of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has transformed our lives, making information accessible from anywhere at any time through a variety of devices. The increased availability of computational power and connectivity at low costs has facilitated the collection, sharing, processing, and access to information. However, this convenience comes with significant privacy risks. The growing awareness of these issues has highlighted the need for privacy-aware policies, regulations, and techniques. The 12th edition of the Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society (WPES) serves as an annual forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss privacy challenges in our interconnected world.

## 1. Introduction
Recent advancements in digital infrastructure have revolutionized how data is collected, stored, managed, processed, shared, and distributed. Thanks to widespread network connectivity, we can now store our photos and videos on external servers, leverage the affordable computational power provided by cloud services, and access remotely stored data from third parties. These are just a few examples of the benefits of living in a globally interconnected society, where information is readily available with a simple click. However, these conveniences come at the cost of increased privacy risks due to the vast amounts of sensitive information being collected, stored, and distributed, and the lack of user control over their own data. As technology evolves, new opportunities and vulnerabilities emerge, drawing increasing attention from researchers, regulators, private users, and public organizations.

WPES aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to discuss privacy issues in the electronic society. These issues span various areas, including data management, social networks, cloud systems, wireless networks, and mobile devices. The workshop provides a platform for participants to share theoretical and experimental results, learn about new solutions for existing privacy problems, and discuss open issues that still need to be addressed. This year marks the 12th edition of WPES, which is held in conjunction with the ACM CCS conference, the flagship annual event of the Special Interest Group on Security, Audit, and Control (SIGSAC) of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). This co-location enriches both events, benefiting from the presence of a broad community of researchers, practitioners, developers, and users interested in information security topics.

The workshop solicited submissions from academia and industry, focusing on novel research in all theoretical and practical aspects of electronic privacy, as well as experimental studies. It also encouraged contributions from other communities, such as law and business, to present their perspectives on technological issues. Topics of interest included, but were not limited to:
- Anonymity, pseudonymity, and unlinkability
- Crowdsourcing for privacy and security
- Data correlation and leakage attacks
- Data security and privacy
- Electronic communication privacy
- Economics of privacy
- Information dissemination control
- Models, languages, and techniques for big data protection
- Personally identifiable information
- Privacy-aware access control
- Privacy and anonymity on the Web
- Privacy in cloud and grid systems
- Privacy and confidentiality management
- Privacy and data mining
- Privacy in the digital business
- Privacy in electronic records
- Privacy enhancing technologies
- Privacy in health care and public administration
- Privacy and human rights
- Privacy metrics
- Privacy in mobile systems
- Privacy in outsourced scenarios
- Privacy policies
- Privacy vs. security
- Privacy in social networks
- Privacy threats
- Privacy and virtual identity
- Public records and personal privacy
- User profiling
- Wireless privacy

## 2. Workshop Contributions
This year, the workshop received a record number of 103 submissions from 27 different countries. The program committee accepted 20 full papers and 10 short papers. The accepted papers cover a wide range of scenarios, including privacy in social networks, privacy of genomic data, privacy in mobile scenarios, and privacy of location data.
