**Analysis and Considerations for Exploit Detection and Decryption**

1. **Preprocessing of Packets:**
   - The preprocessing of packets before analysis incurs a modest additional processing overhead. This overhead has a slightly greater than linear dependence on the payload size, as illustrated in Figure 4.

2. **Decryption Routine:**
   - The decryption routine should not use looping. While loops are often necessary for decryption, inline coding of a decryption routine without loops would be much longer and more easily identifiable.
   - The decryption code and the encrypted exploit payload must be carefully designed. After the decryption process, the decrypted exploit code should bypass the decryption code. We do not claim that there are no such encryption or decryption methods; however, we speculate that avoiding loops in the decryption methods will increase the difficulty for attackers.

3. **Use of External Values:**
   - Polychronakis et al. [19] have noted that attackers can use data from the environment in which the exploit executes. If self-modifying code relies on a key outside the address space of the exploit, it will not be detected by the proposed method. Such exploits, however, will be more platform-specific and thus more sensitive to small system changes and randomization techniques [24].

4. **Long or Infinite Loops:**
   - The analysis time for traversal and execution depends on the length of the derived chain. Long or infinite loops can significantly impact this analysis time.

**Appendix: Disassembly Results of Self-Modifying Decryption Routine for Alpha2 Encoder**

In this appendix, we provide the disassembly results of the self-modifying decryption routine for the Alpha2 encoder. The underlined instructions in Figure 5(b) highlight the seeding instruction of the GetPC code, the memory-write instruction for decrypting the encoded payload, and the instruction for updating the address of the encoded bytes. The underlined bytes in (a) and (b) show the contrast between the modified instructions before and after execution.

**Figure 5: Disassembly of Self-Modifying Decryption Routine for Alpha2 Encoder**
- **(a) Before Execution**
- **(b) After Execution**

In each figure:
- The leftmost column shows the instructions' addresses in hexadecimal format.
- The middle column shows the actual instruction bytes.
- The rightmost column shows the decoded instructions.

For example, the instruction `call 0002` at address `0005` and `pop ecx` at address `0002` are part of the GetPC code in this example.
