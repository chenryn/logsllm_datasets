So far, I have been using Twisted to serve a large number of mobile clients (Android and iPhone) by handling their HTTP requests and exchanging JSON messages. For my next project, I am considering using Google App Engine, but I am unsure if it can provide the same level of performance. Should I opt for a custom-built solution instead?

Google App Engine is capable of automatically scaling your application as the load increases, distributing the work across multiple machines. It also provides a robust and user-friendly web API. Unlike Twisted, where you need to manage deferreds for asynchronous operations, App Engine scales by adding more instances rather than making individual processes asynchronous.

By the way, I currently host web services on Google App Engine that are used by iPhone applications, and they perform well.
