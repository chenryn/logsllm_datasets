#### Machine-Related Focus Areas
- **Speech Schematics**
- **Privacy and Security Protections**

### Current Issues and Challenges
- **The Rise of Machines**: How does the FTC respond as machines become ubiquitous?
- **FTC's Role**:
  - **Unfair Practices**:
    - Substantial injury to consumers
    - Unavoidable
    - Not outweighed by procompetitive benefits
  - **Deceptive Practices**:
    - Likely to mislead consumers
    - Unreasonable
    - Material

### Examples of Unfair and Deceptive Practices
- **Facebook**: Promised to keep personal information safe but allowed third-party access.
- **Google**: Promised Gmail contacts wouldn’t be used elsewhere but used them in its social media site, Buzz.
- **Snapchat**: Promised images would disappear but kept them.
- **Wyndham**: Exposed consumers’ payment card information in three separate data breaches.
- **Oracle**: Promised updates would protect consumers but didn’t protect older versions of Java SE.
- **ASUS**: Promised routers would protect local networks against attacks but failed to update them sufficiently.

### Case Selection Criteria
- **Research**
- **Media Reports**
- **Consumer Complaints**
- **Current Issues**:
  - **Mobile Phone Account Hijacking and New Account Fraud**:
    - January 2013: 1,083 incidents (3.2% of identity theft reports)
    - January 2016: 2,658 incidents (6.3% of identity theft reports)
    - Reported to the FTC Consumer Sentinel Network

### Research Priorities
- **Privacy and Security**:
  - Best ways to assess risks from breaches and vulnerabilities
  - Protecting consumers from ransomware, malvertising, etc.
  - Tying exposed data to specific breaches
  - Making certain attacks less profitable
  - Better spotting fraud
- **IoT Devices**:
  - Ensuring better IoT security
  - Preventing one vulnerable device from compromising others on the same network
- **Emerging Trends**:
  - Protecting privacy with sensor-based monitoring technologies, especially for children
  - Isolating critical systems, such as a connected car’s CAN bus
  - Understanding consumer encounters with bots and their awareness
  - Addressing new fraud, deception, and consumer protection concerns in virtual reality
- **New Tools and Techniques**:
  - Allowing users to control their personal information across contexts
  - Enabling consumers to observe behavior and communication of smart devices
  - Analyzing apps to determine practices associated with third-party libraries
  - Detecting discriminatory algorithms
  - Identifying tracking and cross-device tracking
  - Identifying vulnerable IoT devices
