### 7.2 Trade-Off Between Security and Deployment

Modifying any standardized protocol typically involves significant costs, including propagating changes throughout the mobile communication ecosystem and requiring all users to update their devices. As discussed in Sections 6.1.1 and 6.2.1, to protect against IMSI privacy attacks and DoS attacks, carriers may introduce a public key digital signature mechanism and physically install WIDS (Wireless Intrusion Detection Systems) in the area to shield UEs (User Equipment) from malicious attacks. However, Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) must always balance budget and costs against the need to achieve maximum security objectives.

Table 4 summarizes the trade-offs for security, usability, efficiency, and cost for each countermeasure. We evaluate each countermeasure using the criteria mentioned in Sections 7.1 and 7.2. Each countermeasure is rated as the best (denoted as (cid:32)), medium (denoted as (cid:71)(cid:35)), or the worst (denoted as (cid:35)) based on the criteria. The deployment of "Public Key Infrastructure" and "WIDS" leads to increased complexity and high-cost burdens in the MNOs' network. Specifically, public key infrastructure can increase processing overhead and message traffic, potentially impacting connection latency. Regarding usability, "Auto Connection Disabling" and "Hand-off Policy" modifications can disrupt the seamless service of Wi-Fi Calling. Therefore, we recommend that the "Shared Secret" method described in Section 6.1.1 is the best countermeasure to address the vulnerabilities, considering the trade-offs.

In summary, as shown in Table 5, we have summarized all the attacks and vulnerabilities discovered in Wi-Fi Calling that lead to security threats, violating the security properties of mobile subscribers. We also classified each vulnerability by its type and arranged the countermeasures with the associated trade-offs.

### 8. Related Work

Regarding mobile network security issues, research has focused on users' privacy and availability problems. Shaik et al. [29] discovered that an LTE device could leak its location using cell-tower signal strength information, which can be requested by a base station without authentication. They also designed attacks to deny LTE services to a target device by preventing its access to LTE networks and limiting the connection to 2G/3G networks using commercial devices. Kune et al. [21] demonstrated possible location test attacks, including circumventing the temporary identifier designed to protect the identity of the end user. Arapinis et al. [8] identified vulnerabilities in 3G telephony systems that allow tracing and identifying mobile telephony subscribers using formal methods. Mjolsnes et al. [23] introduced a simple way to catch IMSIs and perform DoS attacks using a rogue base station. In summary, most research has focused on privacy and DoS attacks due to insecure implementations of network components or signaling denial-of-service attacks. Note that these works are primarily concerned with mobile networks, not Wi-Fi Calling.

In the context of Wi-Fi Calling, Beekman et al. [9] introduced the first vulnerabilities in 2013. They discovered several TLS certificate validation vulnerabilities in T-Mobile's Wi-Fi Calling, allowing eavesdropping on voice communications and modification of text via MitM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks. They leveraged the open-source code of the Android IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) stack provided by T-Mobile for developers. However, the current edition of the Wi-Fi Calling specification no longer uses this mechanism, and it is virtually impossible to analyze the server-side IMS stack source code, which is no longer open-source. Therefore, we cannot directly adopt this approach for analysis.

Two research articles address vulnerabilities in the current Wi-Fi Calling specification. O’Hanlon et al. [24] showed that a malicious user could obtain a user’s IMSI and track them over Wi-Fi due to insufficient privacy protection measures in pre-configured device profiles. Although they mentioned acquiring an IMSI through the Wi-Fi Calling IKE handshaking process, they did not provide specific methods and results. In contrast, our study provides detailed procedures for both IMSI privacy and DoS attack issues in Wi-Fi Calling services.

Chalakkal et al. [10] described how sniffing VoLTE (Voice over LTE) and Wi-Fi Calling interfaces can obtain IMSIs and private IPs of IMS by extracting IPSec keys from the IP Multimedia Services Identity Module. They also introduced injection attacks in SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) headers, enabling location manipulation and side-channel attacks. They obtained the keys by directly sniffing the mobile phone's network interface using SIMtrack [25]. This approach requires physical access to the device, making it impractical in real environments. Our work, however, focuses on analyzing network packets in transit and extracting key material using a fake IPSec server.

### 9. Conclusion

In Wi-Fi Calling, weak requirements in the standard specification regarding certifications allow for the lack of mutual authentication during the handshake phases of the security association. By exploiting these vulnerabilities, we can set up a rogue AP (Access Point) that emulates a legitimate server and successfully obtain the target UE’s IMSI and APN. This information can be abused to track user locations by malicious stakeholders. We also demonstrated the feasibility of DoS attacks for Wi-Fi Calling by spoofing packets and modifying the payload. Some payloads, such as the address of the ePDG server and cipher suites, are critical parts of the service. Notably, the call could be dropped suddenly without any alerts, even if the UE has the voice call continuity function for seamless hand-offs.

To protect user privacy and availability against these attacks, we present practical countermeasures with trade-offs among security, deployment, and usability. Subsequent changes based on our work can be introduced in future specifications to reinforce security. Our attacks can be implemented and executed through readily available hardware at low cost.
