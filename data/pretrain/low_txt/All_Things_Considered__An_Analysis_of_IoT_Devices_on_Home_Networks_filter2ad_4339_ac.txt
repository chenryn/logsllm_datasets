### Regional IoT Usage and Device Distribution

#### Western Europe
Western European homes exhibit a high adoption rate of IoT devices, with 57.2% of households having at least one IoT device, compared to 25.7% in Eastern Europe. The distribution of storage devices is similar across the three regions (Table 4).

**Vendor Distribution:**
- **Sagemcom and Free:** These two French companies are prominent in Western Europe, accounting for 15.7% and 9.3% of all media devices, respectively, compared to 5.7% and 3.2% globally. Their market presence is highly localized, with 99% of their devices located in Western and Northern Europe.
- **Other Categories:** In categories such as work appliances, game consoles, and home automation, the distribution closely follows the global pattern. Western Europe, along with North America and Oceania, is one of the few regions where more than 1% of homes have home automation devices.

#### Eastern Europe
Eastern Europe has a higher prevalence of surveillance devices (14% of all devices) compared to Western Europe (5.6%). The distribution of device types changes as more IoT devices are added to homes:
- **One IoT Device:** Surveillance devices account for 5.3%.
- **Three IoT Devices:** Surveillance devices increase to 13.8%.
- **Ten IoT Devices:** Surveillance devices become the most popular, making up 42.7% of all devices.

#### Asia
The four sub-regions of Asia (East, Central, South, and Southeast) have distinct IoT profiles:
- **South, Southeast, and Central Asia:** Surveillance devices make up 54.5%, 37%, and 30.3% of all devices, respectively (Figure 3).
- **East Asia:** Only 9.1% of devices are surveillance-related, likely due to the higher prevalence of other IoT device types.
- **Media Devices:** 9% of Southeast Asian homes and 2.5% of South Asian homes have media devices, compared to over 40% in North America and Western Europe.
- **Hikvision:** The leading vendor of surveillance devices in Southeast and South Asia, accounting for 25.8% and 34.7% of devices, respectively. A private vendor accounts for 15.5% of surveillance devices in Southern Asia.
- **East and Central Asia:** More similar to Eastern Europe and Africa, with work appliances being the most common in East Asia (44.5%) and media devices in Central Asia (54.2%).

#### Africa and Middle East
- **North Africa and Middle East:** Media devices are the most prevalent, appearing in 9.4% of homes and accounting for 35.7% of devices. Vestel, a Turkish TV manufacturer, is the third-largest media vendor after Samsung and LG.
- **Sub-Saharan Africa:** Work appliances are the most popular, making up 50% of devices, with 11% of homes having at least one. HP is the leading vendor, accounting for 33.6% of work appliances.

#### Oceania
- **IoT Adoption:** 49.2% of homes in Oceania have at least one IoT device.
- **Device Types:** Media devices (30.7% of homes), work appliances (19.8%), and gaming consoles (10.1%) are the most common. Home automation devices are found in 0.7% of homes.
- **Voice Assistants and Storage Devices:** Voice assistants appear in 3.2% of homes, and networked storage devices account for 4.3% of all devices, similar to Eastern Europe and East Asia.

### IoT Device Vendors
- **Global Distribution:** 90% of all IoT devices are manufactured by 100 vendors, with 14.3K unique vendors identified.
- **Vendor Dominance:** Some device types, like voice assistants, are dominated by a few vendors (e.g., Amazon and Google account for 91.9% of voice assistants). Media and surveillance devices are more diverse, with the top 10 vendors accounting for only 60% of media devices.

### Vendor Correlation by Device Type
- **Consistency Across Regions:** Device types dominated by a few vendors (e.g., game consoles) show strong correlations across regions, indicating stable vendor preferences. Media and storage devices, however, show no correlation, indicating regional differences in vendor preferences.

### Home Security
- **Embedded Servers:** 67.5% of IoT devices provide at least one TCP- or UDP-based service, with UPnP (46.2%), HTTP, and mDNS being the most common protocols.
- **Weak Credentials:** 7.1% of IoT devices and 14.6% of home routers support weak default credentials, with "admin/admin" being the most common (88.3% for FTP and 35.6% for Telnet).

This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of IoT device usage, vendor distribution, and security concerns across different regions.
