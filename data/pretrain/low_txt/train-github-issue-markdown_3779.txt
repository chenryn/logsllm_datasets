### Issue Description

I have thoroughly searched the issues in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

#### Expected Behavior
When I click on a Select component, I do not expect the webpage's scrollbar to disappear.

#### Current Behavior
The scrollbar disappears when a Select component is active.

#### Context
This issue is particularly annoying because, in some situations, it changes the layout of the page.
