### Issue Description

When compiling NumPy version 1.4.0 using the Sun Studio Compilers (version 12 Update 1) on a Linux system (specifically, OpenSUSE 11.1), approximately 30 tests in `numpy.test()` fail. All of these failures are related to the `arctan2` function.

### Background

In revision 7732, a patch was applied to `trunk/numpy/core/src/private/npy_config.h` to address issues reported in tickets #1799, #1800, and #1801. This patch involved undefining the `HAVE_ATAN2` variable to fix a broken `atan2` implementation on Solaris. However, this change is not beneficial when using the Sun Studio 12.1 compiler on Linux. The `arctan2` function only works correctly with `HAVE_ATAN2` defined.

### Proposed Solution

The attached patch ensures that the original patch (which undefines `HAVE_ATAN2`) is only applied on Sun platforms (i.e., not on Linux). When this patch is applied, all tests pass successfully under Linux.

### Additional Notes

- I did not observe the issues described in tickets #1802 or #1803.
- I do not have access to a Solaris machine, so I cannot verify whether the original patch (intended for Sun Workshop 6, which is no longer available) is still necessary for Sun Studio 12.1.
