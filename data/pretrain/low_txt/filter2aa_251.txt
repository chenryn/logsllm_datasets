# Gaining Awareness about "Google Hacking" by Johnny Long

## Disclaimer
- The printed/CD version of this presentation is significantly shorter than the live version.
- The live version includes many more techniques and examples. I can't leave a paper trail... =^P
- DEFCON attendees: This print version is the same as the Blackhat talk, but the live version is very different! I’m too lazy to make two print versions ;-)

## Overview
This presentation will cover how hackers can use Google to locate vulnerable targets and sensitive information. This process is known as "Google hacking." We will go through the basics, keeping in mind that this is DEFCON!

## Advanced Operators
Google's advanced operators help refine searches using a specific syntax:
- `operator:search_term` (no space between the operator, colon, and search term)

### Common Operators
- `site:`: Restrict a search to a specific website or domain.
  - Example: `site:microsoft.com`
- `filetype:`: Search within the text of a particular type of file.
- `link:`: Search within hyperlinks.
- `cache:`: Display the cached version of a web page.
- `intitle:`: Search for a term in the title of a document.
- `inurl:`: Search only within the URL (web address) of a document.

## Search Characters
- `+`: Force inclusion of a search term.
- `-`: Exclude a search term.
- `"`: Use quotes around search phrases.
- `.`: A single-character wildcard.
- `*`: Any word.

## Site Crawling
- To find every web page Google has crawled for a specific site, use the `site:` operator.
  - Example: `site:microsoft.com`

### Locating Additional Servers
- Subtract common hostnames from the query to find additional servers.
  - Example: `site:microsoft.com -site:www.microsoft.com`

## Directory Listings
- Directory listings can provide valuable information.
  - Example: `intitle:index.of/admin`
- They can also reveal server version information.
  - Example: `intitle:index.of apache server.at`

## Default Server Pages
- Web servers with default pages can be easy targets.
  - Examples:
    - `intitle:test.page.for.apache "it worked"`
    - `allintitle:Netscape FastTrack Server Home Page`
    - `intitle:"Welcome to Windows 2000 Internet Services"`
    - `intitle:welcome.to.IIS.4.0`
    - `allintitle:Welcome to Windows XP Server Internet Services`
    - `allintitle:"Welcome to Internet Information Server"`
    - `allintitle:Netscape Enterprise Server Home Page`
    - `allintitle:Netscape FASTTRACK Server Home Page`

## Default Documents
- Servers can be profiled via default manuals and documentation.
  - Example: `intitle:"Apache HTTP Server" intitle:"documentation"`

## Error Messages
- Server profiling can be done using error messages.
  - Example: `intitle:"Error using Hypernews" "Server Software"`
- CGI environment variables can provide a lot of information.
  - Example: `"HTTP_USER_AGENT=Googlebot"`

## Vulnerability Trolling
- Attackers often find vulnerable targets via Google.
- Example advisory: [Insert Advisory Here]
- A quick browse of the vendor’s website can reveal demos and potential vectors.
  - Example: `intitle: search suggests more vectors…`
- Documentation included with the product can also be a source of poorly configured sites.
- Other searches are easy to discover as well.
- A creative search can find vulnerable targets.
  - Example: [Insert Creative Search Here]

## CGI Scanning
- Attackers use CGI scanners to locate web vulnerabilities on a larger scale.
- These scanners read a data file and query target web servers looking for vulnerable files.
- Example queries:
  - `inurl:/iisadmpwd/`
  - `inurl:/iisadmpwd/achg.htr`
  - `inurl:/iisadmpwd/aexp.htr`
  - `inurl:/iisadmpwd/aexp2.htr`
  - `inurl:/iisadmpwd/aexp2b.htr`

## Port Scanning
- Although port numbers are sometimes found in URLs, scanning just for a port number yields too many results.
- Creative queries can be used to sniff out services listening on specific ports.
  - Example: `"VNC Desktop" inurl:5800`
  - Example: `inurl:webmin inurl:10000`
- Google can be used to find sites that perform port scanning for you, such as the Network Query Tool (NQT).
  - Example: `nqt.php`

## Login Portals
- Generic login portals can be found using various queries.
  - Examples:
    - Microsoft Outlook Web Access
    - Coldfusion Admin Page
    - Windows Remote Desktop
    - Citrix Metaframe

## SQL Information
- Gathering SQL usernames is simple.
  - Example: [Insert SQL Username Search Here]
- SQL dumps made by phpmyadmin can be found.
  - Example: [Insert SQL Dump Search Here]
- Complete database schema dumps can also be located.
  - Example: [Insert Schema Dump Search Here]
- SQL injection targets can be found using specific queries.
  - Example: [Insert SQL Injection Search Here]
- Misconfigured graphical front-ends to SQL can allow anyone admin access.
  - Example: [Insert Misconfigured Front-End Search Here]

## Prevention
- Do not put sensitive data on your website, even temporarily.
- Proactively check your web presence with Google regularly.
- Use sites like http://johnny.ihackstuff.com to stay updated on the latest "Google Hacks."
- Use `site:` queries against each of your web hosts.
- Don’t forget about hosts that do not have DNS names.
- Scan each result page to ensure that only intended pages are in Google’s database.
- Automate your scans with tools like sitedigger by Foundstone.
