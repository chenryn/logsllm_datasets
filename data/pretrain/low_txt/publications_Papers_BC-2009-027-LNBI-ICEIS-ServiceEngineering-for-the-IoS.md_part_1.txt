**Abstract:**
The Internet and the Web have expanded traditional business networks by enabling a web of digital resources to collaborate and create value for organizations. In the most industrialized countries, there has been a significant shift from a manufacturing-based economy to a service-based economy, where prosperity is largely driven by services. From a technological perspective, developing web-based infrastructures to support and deliver services in this new economy presents several challenges. From a business perspective, it is crucial to understand how value is created through these services. This paper outlines our approach to addressing both perspectives and realizing the vision of the Internet of Services (IoS), where web-based, IT-supported service ecosystems form the foundation of service business value networks. We discuss the key issues that need to be explored to provide an integrated technical and business infrastructure for the IoS.

## 1. Introduction
Over the years, organizations have continuously introduced new business models to gain a competitive advantage or to tap into untapped markets. For example, IKEA popularized the concept of self-assembly furniture, eBay pioneered online auctions, and Dell used the Internet to bypass traditional distribution channels and reduce costs. These new or adapted business models often arise from the intuitive realization that something can be done differently, driven by a business need.

Recently, the vision of the Internet of Services (IoS) has emerged as a new business model that could fundamentally change how we discover and invoke services. The IoS envisions an infrastructure that uses the Internet to offer and sell services, making them tradable goods. Service marketplaces, which bring together service consumers and providers to trade services, are a key enabling technology for the IoS. Thus, the IoS provides the business and technical foundation for advanced business models, where service providers and consumers form business networks for service provision and consumption. Within these networks, organizations collaborate to deliver services to consumers, creating value through their relationships with customers, intermediaries, aggregators, and suppliers.

From an IT perspective, the IoS requires a global description of standards, tools, applications, and architectures to support the business perspective. The service-oriented architecture (SOA) paradigm has gained widespread acceptance as a strategy for consolidating and repurposing applications in more dynamic environments through configurable services. Services can be composed into advanced business processes that interoperate with other services across organizational boundaries. This paper describes the challenges in supporting the IoS concept and identifies areas that need to be explored to enable a radically new way of trading services on the Internet. Special attention will be given to service marketplaces and service engineering, which we see as fundamental for creating and managing services.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows:
- **Section 2:** Describes the role of marketplaces and clarifies the concept of services in the IoS.
- **Section 3:** Identifies a set of requirements to support the IoS and drive a new "service industry."
- **Section 4:** Discusses the importance of Service Engineering (SE) for the IoS.
- **Section 5:** Presents our conclusions.

## 2. Marketplaces for the Internet of Services
Electronic marketplaces for products, such as eBay and Amazon, have gained significant attention in recent years, enabling business interactions between providers and consumers of physical goods. In the IoS vision, services are treated as tradable goods that can be offered on service marketplaces by their providers, making them available to potential consumers. A service marketplace can host multiple providers, ranging from large companies to small, specialized service providers, creating an ecosystem of competing and collaborating services.

### 2.1 What Are Services?
The terms "Service," "e-Service," and "Web Service" are often used interchangeably, but they refer to related concepts from different domains. These terms generally identify an autonomous software component uniquely identified by a URI and accessible using standard Internet protocols like XML, SOAP, or HTTP. To better understand these concepts, we introduce the following definitions for the IoS:

- **Business Service:** In business and economics, a service is an intangible activity provided by a service provider to a service consumer to create value. Traditionally, business services are discovered and invoked manually, but they can be realized through automated or manual means. Examples include haircuts, house painting, and form filling. If a service is executed via automated mechanisms, such as processing an insurance claim, it is still considered a service.

- **e-Service:** With the advent of the Internet, companies began using electronic information technologies to supply services processed with automated applications. E-services are network-resident software services accessible via standardized protocols, whose functionality can be automatically discovered and integrated into applications or composed to form more complex services. E-services are a subset of business services and use the Internet or equivalent networks as a channel to interact with consumers. For example, withdrawing money from an ATM is facilitated by an e-service.

- **Web Service:** Web services are e-services made available to consumers using web-based protocols or programs. There are three types of web services: RPC Web Services, SOA Web Services, and RESTful Web Services. RPC Web Services bring distributed programming functions from the RPC world, while SOA Web Services implement a message-oriented architecture. RESTful Web Services are based on HTTP and focus on interacting with stateful resources.

### 2.2 Discovery, Invocation, and Execution of Services
The lifecycle of services in the IoS includes two main phases: discovery/invocation and execution. Discovery and invocation involve the medium and technology used to find and request a service (e.g., human-based, EDI, web-based). Execution describes how the service is carried out, which can be purely human, a combination of human and automated devices, or fully automated. In the IoS, the discovery and invocation of all services are IT-based, with service marketplaces providing the access point to available services. For example, a house painting service might be selected via a service marketplace, but the actual painting is performed by humans.

This paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and requirements for the IoS, emphasizing the role of service marketplaces and service engineering in realizing this vision.
