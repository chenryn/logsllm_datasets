**Title: Black Hat EU 2021 - No More Secret Sauce!: How Open Algorithms and Benchmarks Can Drive Real Progress in Security Machine Learning**

While we've witnessed groundbreaking advancements in machine learning (ML) across language, vision, and robotics, the progress in security ML remains hampered by unverifiable product claims and misleading marketing. In my talk, I will argue that to address this, we need to foster a culture of research transparency in security ML, similar to the openness already present in subfields like cryptography.

Instead of relying on vague claims about "secret sauce," we should embrace a culture of publishing our ML models, allowing for open scrutiny and critique. Furthermore, rather than making non-reproducible claims about model accuracy, we should establish and use community-curated benchmarks to demonstrate the relative efficacy of our ML approaches.

During my presentation, I will elaborate on this argument and introduce the SOREL dataset, which contains 20 million samples. This dataset, released by my team in collaboration with Reversing Labs, is designed to support more transparent and rigorous evaluations of security ML models.
