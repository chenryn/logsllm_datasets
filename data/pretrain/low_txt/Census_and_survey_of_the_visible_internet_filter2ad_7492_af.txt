## Figure 10: Number of Addresses Protected by Visible Firewalls
- **Data Source**: IT 7 through IT 17w
- **Description**: This figure shows the number of addresses protected by visible firewalls (including personal firewalls) in absolute terms (left scale) and as a ratio to responsive, non-firewalled addresses (right scale).
- **Observations**:
  - Nearly 40 million addresses are protected by visible firewalls.
  - The visibly firewalled space is a small fraction (about 1.5%) of the allocated address space (2.6B–2.8B addresses).
  - The firewalled address space is relatively stable over three years of observation.
  - The ratio of addresses protected by visible firewalls to the number of responsive, non-firewalled addresses has declined from 1:2 in mid-2005 to nearly 1:3 by the end of 2006.
  - This trend may be due to an increase in invisible firewalls, but further investigation is needed.

## Figure 11: Cumulative Distribution of Firewalled Block Size
- **Data Source**: IT 7 through IT 17w
- **Description**: This graph omits 190–225k personal firewalls and shows the cumulative distribution of firewalled block sizes.
- **Observations**:
  - There are between 190k and 224k personal firewalls across the surveys, with no consistent trend over time.
  - Personal firewalls outnumber block firewalls by a ratio of 4:1.
  - Block firewalls cover more than 99% of the firewalled address space.
  - Bumps in block sizes are observed at powers of two, with pronounced bumps at /24, /29, and /30 blocks.
  - A slight increase in the number of blocks is noted, mostly due to additional firewalls covering single addresses.

## Conjectures on Firewall Use
- **Stability in Firewalled Hosts**: The number of firewalled hosts has remained relatively stable, suggesting that most newly deployed hosts are either visible or behind silent firewalls.
- **Visibility of Existing Firewalls**: Existing firewalls maintain visibility, while new firewalls are configured to be invisible, reflecting a heightened sense of security in new deployments and inertia in changing existing configurations.
- **Sub-/24 Block Structure**: The analysis confirms administrative structure in the Internet at sub-/24 block sizes, which was previously hidden from BGP-based analysis.

## Validation
- **USC Network Data**: 
  - 35 firewalled blocks were detected and confirmed by network administrators.
  - No false positives were found, and the block sizes were accurately estimated for 24, with minor discrepancies in six small blocks.
  - Overall, 2,639 out of 2,674 firewalled addresses were correctly identified.
- **False Negatives**:
  - Invisible firewalls: 7,720 passive-only addresses in Table 3 are likely invisible firewalled space.
  - Possible undetected visible firewalls, though frequent probing makes this unlikely.

## Related Work
- **Previous Censuses**: The last full Internet census was in 1982 [41]. Our approach enumerates all possible IP addresses.
- **Active Surveys**: Robin Whittle's survey in March 2007 [49] estimated about 107M responsive addresses, similar to our report of 103M in IT 15w.
- **Web Content Studies**: He et al. [16] use random sampling to study web content, focusing on the open web.
- **Domain Name System (DNS) Traversal**: ISC's reverse address space censuses since 1994 [24] contact name servers for reverse-name mappings, complementing our approach.
- **Connectivity Measurement Projects**: Rocketfuel [45], Mercator [13], Skitter [19], and Dimes [40] focus on macroscopic router-level connectivity.
- **IP Address Space Studies**: Meng et al. [31] use BGP routing tables to study IPv4 address allocation, while Kohler et al. [26] study IP destination address structure through passive observations.
- **Firewall Detection Tools**: p0f [35] and nmap [38] are more accurate but more invasive than our approach.

## Future Work and Conclusions
- **Future Directions**: Refining methodology, exploring probe retransmissions, and improving understanding of the visible Internet and hidden hosts.
- **Conclusions**: This paper demonstrates the feasibility of walking the entire IPv4 address space, quantifies sources of measurement error, and provides insights into address space utilization and firewall deployment.
