**Title: Botconf2013 - Malware Calling: An Analysis of Zitmo (ZeuS in the Mobile)**

Zitmo, a variant of the notorious ZeuS malware, first emerged in early 2011, targeting bank customers in Poland and Spain. The extent of its infection is unknown but believed to be significant. Zitmo operates through a dual-component system: a spyware component installed on a PC and an application installed on a mobile device.

The PC-based spyware is compatible with all modern Windows operating systems (from Windows 2000 to Windows 8) and supports both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. The mobile component, initially designed for Android, also has versions prepared for Symbian and BlackBerry devices.

Recent analysis has revealed that the banking Trojan used in this malware is a unique blend of ZeuS and SpyEye, functioning as a modular component. This banker module is just one of several functionalities offered by Zitmo. Additionally, it incorporates a sophisticated communication scheme for transmitting stolen data from mobile phones, which is still under investigation.

In our presentation, we will demonstrate how Zitmo operates on both PCs and mobile devices to facilitate financial theft. We will also release tools to aid in the analysis of this malware.
