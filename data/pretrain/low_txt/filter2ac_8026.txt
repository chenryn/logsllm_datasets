**Title: Botconf2022 - Operation GamblingPuppet: Analysis of a Multivector and Multiplatform Campaign Targeting Online Gambling Customers**

Despite being illegal in some countries, the global online gambling industry continues to grow steadily year after year, particularly thriving in the current environment, which has been significantly influenced by the global pandemic. This trend has not gone unnoticed by advanced threat actors, as we have observed and analyzed several campaigns targeting online gambling platforms.

In this research, we focus on a multiplatform (Windows and Linux) campaign that utilizes both known espionage tools and new malware families. The campaign is operated by individuals with knowledge of the Chinese language, and its primary victims are online gambling customers in Southeast Asia.

We have identified several interesting infection vectors, including backdoored or fake installers for popular applications, and even a custom chat application. These vectors suggest a highly targeted and sophisticated campaign.
