# A Survey of Bitmap Index-Compression Algorithms for Big Data

## Abstract
This paper provides a comprehensive survey of bitmap index-compression algorithms, focusing on their application in big data. The authors review and analyze various compression techniques, including word-aligned hybrid (WAH), position list word-aligned hybrid (PLWAH), and others. The survey covers both traditional and recent advancements in the field, with a particular emphasis on performance and efficiency.

## 1. Introduction
Bitmap indexes are widely used in database systems for fast query processing, especially in scenarios involving large datasets. However, the storage and retrieval of bitmap indexes can be challenging due to their size.
