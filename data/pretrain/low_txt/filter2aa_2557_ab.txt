### Protection of Digital Content and Its Impact on Research

The implementation of measures to protect digital content, while intended to safeguard intellectual property, has in some specific cases alienated large segments of the research community. This issue is highlighted by Wade Roush in his article, “Breaking Microsoft's e-Book Code,” published in *Technology Review* in November 2001.

### Foreign Scientists Avoiding the U.S.

Following the arrest of Russian programmer Dmitry Sklyarov, foreign scientists have expressed concerns about traveling to the United States. Some have advocated for boycotting conferences held in the U.S., and several conference organizers have moved their events to non-U.S. locations. Russia has even issued a travel warning to its programmers planning to visit the U.S.

### Resignation of British Linux Programmer Alan Cox

Highly respected British Linux programmer Alan Cox resigned from the USENIX committee of the Advanced Computing Systems Association due to concerns about traveling to the U.S. Cox has urged USENIX to hold its annual conference offshore. The International Information Hiding Workshop Conference, where Professor Felten’s team intended to present their original paper, has also decided to hold all future conferences outside the U.S. following the SDMI threat to Professor Felten and his team.

### Censorship of 2600 Magazine

The case of *Universal City Studios v. Reimerdes* illustrates the chilling effect that Section 1201 of the DMCA has had on the freedom of the press. In this case, eight major motion picture companies brought a DMCA suit against 2600 magazine to block it from publishing the DeCSS software program, which decrypts the encryption used on DVD movies. Despite not being involved in the development or use of the software for copyright infringement, the district court permanently barred 2600 from publishing or linking to the DeCSS code. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld this decision in November 2001.

### CNET Reporter Feels Chill

CNET News reporter Declan McCullagh found four publicly available documents on the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) website. Although no password was required to download the documents, they were encrypted and needed a password to be opened. McCullagh obtained the passwords from an anonymous source but refrained from reading the documents due to fear of DMCA liability. This situation highlights how the DMCA can interfere with the newsgathering process.

### Microsoft Threatens Slashdot

In spring 2000, Microsoft invoked the DMCA against the internet publication forum Slashdot, demanding the removal of materials related to Microsoft’s proprietary implementation of the Kerberos security standard. When Slashdot users republished the Microsoft specification, Microsoft again invoked the DMCA, leading to concerns about the impact on fair use and free speech.

### AVSforum.com Censors TiVo Discussion

The fear of DMCA litigation has also affected smaller web bulletin boards. For example, in June 2001, the administrator of AVSforum.com, a popular forum for TiVo users, censored discussions about a software program that allowed users to move video from their TiVos to personal computers, citing concerns about potential legal issues.

### Fair Use Under Siege

Fair use is a crucial element of American copyright law, allowing the public to use copyrighted works without permission for personal, noncommercial uses and activities such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. However, the DMCA’s anti-circumvention provisions prohibit the creation or distribution of tools necessary for fair use, potentially eliminating these rights.

### Advanced e-Book Processor and e-Books

The criminal prosecution of Dmitry Sklyarov and ElcomSoft over the Advanced e-Book Processor, which translates e-books from Adobe’s e-Book format to PDF, raised concerns about the future of fair use for books. The tool allows legitimate purchasers of e-books to make fair uses, such as reading them on different devices and accessing them in the future, which would otherwise be restricted.
