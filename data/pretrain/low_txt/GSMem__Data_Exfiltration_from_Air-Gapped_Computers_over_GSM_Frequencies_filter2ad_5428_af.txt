### Appendix A: Receiver Implementation (Android Application Level)

In this appendix, we demonstrate how, under certain circumstances, the GSMem signals can be received by an application running on a modern Android smartphone with an untampered baseband. This technique is limited to close proximity to the transmitter (10 cm).

#### Android Radio Interface Layer (RIL)

Android, as part of its open-source framework, defines the upper software layers with respect to its hardware peripherals. In Android, the Radio Interface Layer (RIL) component interfaces between high-level telephony services and the baseband hardware. Each vendor supplies its own implementation for the RIL interface. The vendor RIL is closed source and shipped with the stock Android firmware as a shared object (.so) binary file.

#### Signal Demodulation

We developed a reception method referred to as "neighbor cell jamming." According to the GSM standard, mobile equipment must periodically listen to the broadcasted pilot channels of neighboring cells to provide service reliability [58]. Generally, the mobile must always be registered to a cell, preferably the one with the best reception. These broadcasts are sent over logical channels called Broadcast Control Channels (BCCH), which carry information such as the cell’s ID and configuration. The GSM baseband component maintains a list of the best neighboring cells along with their received power level (in dBm or equivalent units) and other information. Since GSMem operates at the same frequency as the neighboring BTSs, it is possible for a GSMem transmitter to affect a drop in the reception of a station that is rather far away. This jamming effect can be used as a side channel to detect the B-ASK modulation; a sudden drop in reception quality represents a '1', and otherwise, a '0'.

#### Implementation

Android allows obtaining neighboring cells' information from the baseband. For example, by invoking the method `telephonyManager.getNeighboringCellInfo()`. Our Android application repeated an algorithm similar to Algorithm 2 (Section 6) with a few modifications. It continuously sampled and stored the signal strength of the weakest cell out of the neighboring cells (the cell which our transmission will likely override). The modulation is low RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) representing '1' (transmission occurred) and high RSSI (no transmission) representing '0'. Figure 14 shows the reception of a single bit, as received by our application on the Samsung Galaxy S5 smartphone. The phone was located 10 cm away from a transmitting workstation. The 'jammed' cell had a signal strength of 23 ASU (equal to -67 dBm) before it was jammed. At second 6, the GSMem at the workstation transmitted '1', causing a drop in the RSSI measurement for that cell. The transmission stopped at second 8.
