**Title: Black Hat US-19: Exploiting Qualcomm WLAN and Modem Over the Air**

In this presentation, we will share our research on successfully exploiting Qualcomm's WLAN firmware at the FIRMWARE layer, breaking down the isolation between the WLAN and Modem, and ultimately gaining full control over the Modem via over-the-air (OTA) attacks. 

A critical component of our research is the setup of a real-time debugger. Without this tool, it would be extremely challenging to inspect the program flow and runtime status. On the Qualcomm platform, subsystems are protected by Secure Boot, making them inaccessible from the outside. We will introduce a vulnerability we discovered in the Modem that allowed us to bypass Secure Boot and elevate privileges locally, enabling the setup of a live debugger for the baseband.

The Modem and WLAN firmware are highly complex, and reverse engineering them is a formidable task. Thanks to the debugger, we were able to map out the system architecture, identify key components, trace program and data flows, and pinpoint attack surfaces within the WLAN firmware. We will share these techniques in detail, along with the zero-day vulnerabilities we discovered on these attack surfaces.

Qualcomm's baseband includes multiple mitigations, such as Data Execution Prevention (DEP), stack protection, heap cookies, and system call constraints. During the presentation, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the exploitation techniques and methods we used to bypass these mitigations.

Starting with the Snapdragon 835, the WLAN firmware has been integrated into the Modem subsystem as an isolated user space application. We will discuss the constraints imposed by this integration and how we leveraged the weaknesses we identified to fully exploit the Modem.
