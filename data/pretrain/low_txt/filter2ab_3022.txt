**ATT&CK ID:** T1595.001  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Scanning IP Blocks

Adversaries may conduct scans of victim IP blocks to gather information that can be used for targeting. Public IP addresses are often allocated to organizations in blocks or as a range of sequential addresses. By scanning these IP ranges, attackers can identify active hosts, open ports, and other network characteristics that may be useful in planning and executing their attacks.
