### Recent Attacks on SSL/TLS

It is important to note that there has been recent research ([9, 24, 7, 43, 28]) focusing on attacks against SSL/TLS. Most of these attacks do not target the cryptographic algorithms themselves but rather their implementation or specific peculiarities of the SSL/TLS protocol. These vulnerabilities can often be mitigated by applying specific patches to the SSL/TLS software. However, we currently lack a reliable method to measure the effectiveness of these preventive measures.

### Conclusions and Future Work

In this study, we introduced the Probing SSL Security Tool (PSST) and used it to analyze the security of over 19,000 servers on the Internet. Given the significant volume of sensitive transactions that rely on SSL/TLS, understanding the current security measures and their efficacy is crucial. This is especially true as our knowledge of cryptography evolves rapidly, and previously secure protocols are found to have vulnerabilities. For example, SHA-1 was considered secure and even recommended by NIST when we first conducted our experiments in February 2005. By August 2005, serious flaws were discovered in SHA-1. Our results indicate a wide variability in the level of cryptographic support among Internet servers running SSL/TLS, with a significant portion supporting weak, broken, or outdated cryptography.

In addition to its utility as a security tool, PSST can also be valuable for benchmarking SSL/TLS server performance. Efforts to improve the performance of the cryptographic components of SSL/TLS can be focused on the most commonly used algorithms.

We see several areas for future work:

- **Expired and Self-Signed Certificates:** Murray’s 2001 study tested for expired and self-signed certificates. We plan to extend PSST to include these tests.
- **Measuring Larger Numbers of Servers:** While our current list of servers is extensive, advancements in CPU power now allow us to probe a larger fraction of the available IPv4 address space by randomly selecting IP addresses.
- **SSL VPNs:** As the use of SSL for Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) increases, this area warrants further investigation.
- **SSH Servers:** Although SSH handles authentication differently from SSL, many of the cipher suites are the same. Ensuring the cryptographic strength of SSH, which is often the entry point into organizations, is essential.
- **Client-Side Studies:** This work has focused on server-side cryptographic strength. Evaluating client-side usage would provide a more comprehensive view of end-to-end security. One approach could be to monitor traffic to and from high-volume SSL servers.
