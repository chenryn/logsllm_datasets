# Solution Architectures in Azure Data Explorer

Azure Data Explorer is a fully managed, high-performance, big data analytics platform designed to analyze large volumes of data in near real-time. It can be integrated with other Azure services to create comprehensive solutions for diverse use cases. Use the [Azure Architecture Center](/azure/architecture/) to find suitable architectures, reusable patterns, and customer stories that can guide your decision-making process.

This document provides an overview of various solution architectures that incorporate Azure Data Explorer.

## Big Data Analytics with Azure Data Explorer

Azure Data Explorer and Azure Synapse Analytics work together to support near real-time analytics and modern data warehousing. This combination is ideal for scenarios requiring fast and efficient data processing.

## Geospatial Data Processing and Analytics

A solution for making large volumes of geospatial data available for analytics. The architecture uses the following Azure services:

- **Azure Databricks** with GIS Spark libraries for data processing.
- **Azure Database for PostgreSQL** for querying data through APIs.
- **Azure Data Explorer** for running fast exploratory queries.
- **Azure Maps** for creating visualizations in web applications.
- **Power BI** with Azure Maps visual feature for customized reports.

## Long-Term Security Log Retention with Azure Data Explorer

A solution for long-term retention of security logs. The core of the architecture is Azure Data Explorer, which provides cost-effective storage for security data while keeping it queryable. Other key components include:

- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** and **Microsoft Sentinel** for:
  - Comprehensive endpoint security
  - Security information and event management (SIEM)
  - Security orchestration automated response (SOAR)
- **Log Analytics** for short-term storage of Sentinel security logs.

## Data Analytics for Automotive Test Fleets

Automotive OEMs need solutions to minimize the time between conducting test drives and delivering diagnostic data to R&D engineers. This workload covers both telemetry and batch test drive data ingestion scenarios, focusing on the data platform and visualization connectors.

The solution also uses the following services:

- **Azure IoT Hub**
- **Azure Blob Storage**
- **Azure Event Hubs**
- **Azure Functions**
- **Azure Managed Grafana**
- **Azure App Service**
- **Azure Maps**
- **Azure API Management**
- **Power BI**
