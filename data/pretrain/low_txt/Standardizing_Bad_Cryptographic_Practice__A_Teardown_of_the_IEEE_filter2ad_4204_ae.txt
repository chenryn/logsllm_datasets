### Synthesized Netlist and Security Vulnerabilities in CBC Mode Encryption

Major FPGA vendors, such as Synplify and Vivado, support the synthesis of netlists. However, this technique does not recover high-level RTL code, which is a primary concern for IP piracy. Numerous attacks have targeted various protocols and standards that use CBC mode for encryption.

#### Padding Oracle Attacks on CBC Mode

In 2002, Vaudenay demonstrated that padding errors in CBC mode can be used as an oracle to decrypt text without knowing the key [35]. Canvel et al. extended this idea by exploiting timing differences between errors due to bad MACs and improper padding, to intercept passwords from email clients connecting to IMAP servers over SSL/TLS [11].

Vaudenay's attack exploited the RC5-CBC-PAD algorithm [7], while Paterson and Yau demonstrated efficient attacks on the ISO CBC Mode Encryption standard to recover plaintext [29]. These attacks required IVs to be public. The same group later developed new padding-oracle attacks against the revamped ISO CBC Mode Encryption standard, which recommended private and random IVs instead of public IVs [37].

Joux et al. introduced attacks on CBC mode by adversaries that can adaptively choose chunks of plaintext bytes to find the original message, terming these adversaries as block-wise-adaptive adversaries [15]. Black et al. studied Vaudenay’s attack with different padding schemes, such as XY-pad, OZ-pad, and AByte-pad, and found that padding methods with no invalid paddings are immune to padding-oracle attacks [9]. This was corroborated by Paterson and Watson in their security analysis of CBC mode [28]. Klíma et al. used ASN.1 encoding errors in PKCS#7 with AByte padding as an oracle to invert the ciphertext [19]. Most of these attacks can be thwarted by enforcing integrity checks on the ciphertext.

#### Chosen Ciphertext Attacks

Before Vaudenay’s attack on CBC mode, Bleichenbacher presented an adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack that exploits padding errors in PKCS#1 v1.5 [10]. Klíma et al. extended this attack by using errors due to version number checks in PKCS#1 as a side-channel [18]. RSAES-OAEP was proposed to make it immune to such chosen ciphertext attacks, but Manger exploited side channels in implementations of RSAES-OAEP as specified in PKCS#1 v2.0 to recover the plaintext message [20].

### Comparison of Padding-Oracle Attack (POA) and Syntax-Oracle Attack (SOA)

From Figure 9, it is evident that with the ABAO optimization, the POA is approximately 13 times (mean 12.6 with a standard deviation of 1.3) slower than the SOA. This is because in the POA, for \( j < 16 \), the \( j \)-th plaintext character can only be guessed after the \( (j + 1) \)-th character has been found. There is no such restriction in the SOA, where all instances of the guessed character in the entire ciphertext can be identified in a single guess.

Though the SOA is faster, it loses some accuracy with the ABAO optimization, averaging 85.3% accuracy with a standard deviation of 4.4%. In contrast, the POA is always 100% accurate. Without the ABAO optimization, the SOA's accuracy increases to nearly 98%. It is important to note that the POA works only with AES-CBC and padding schemes that distinguish between valid and invalid padding, whereas the SOA has no such restrictions.

### Related Work

To our knowledge, Myrian and Chow [23] provide the only work that presents any attack on the IEEE P1735 standard. The adversary can distinguish between errors during decoding and those due to incorrect integer-to-octet conversion, as the standard is vague on error conditions. Apart from these, there have been numerous side-channel attacks, including padding error attacks on RSA [14, 17, 22], timing attacks on AES-CBC implementations in SSL/TLS [4], and other side-channel attacks [9, 21, 24, 33, 39].

### Conclusion and Future Work

The P1735 IP encryption standard is widely used in the EDA community to protect the confidentiality of high-value IPs and enforce fine-grained access control via rights management and licensing mechanisms. We have presented confidentiality and integrity attacks on the P1735 standard as implemented by the widely used Synplify Premier tool. While the confidentiality attacks can reveal the entire plaintext IP, the integrity attack enables an attacker to insert hardware Trojans into the encrypted IP. We also proposed optimizations of the basic confidentiality attacks that reduce the complexity from \( O(N^2) \) to \( O(N) \).

The design flaws in P1735 are concerning, especially since it is susceptible to classical POA reported in 2002. It is disappointing that an international organization like the IEEE would mandate a brittle encryption mode (CBC) without any authentication, given the extensive research on AEAD schemes. The standard also recommends PKCS#1 v1.5 as a padding scheme for RSA, which is vulnerable to many side-channel attacks.

In future work, we plan to attack the Key Block of the encrypted IP, which holds the encryption of the symmetric key used to create the Data Block, using the RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 encryption scheme. We will also extend our cryptanalysis to other EDA tools (e.g., Xilinx) and evaluate license-proxy implementations complying with the P1735 standard as they become available.
