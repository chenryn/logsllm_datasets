### Market Resources and Transparency

To attract high-quality developers, market resources should be effectively utilized. For instance, advertising on the starting page can significantly boost app promotion. In terms of transparency, while Google Play requires developers to publish their privacy policies when they obtain and use sensitive user data, none of the Chinese app markets have this requirement. However, nine markets (Google Play, Tencent Myapp, Baidu, 360, OPPO, Huawei, 25PP, Sougou, and AppChina) explicitly inform users whether the apps contain advertisements. Only Google Play and 360 market report the presence of in-app purchases in the apps.

### APK Collection

We implemented a crawler to harvest APKs from Google Play and 16 alternative Chinese Android app stores listed in Table 1 in August 2017. For each app, we collected publicly available metadata, including the app name, version name, category, description, downloads, ratings, and release/update date.

#### Crawler Strategies

- **Google Play**: We used a list of 1.5 million package names provided by PrivacyGrade [78] as the initial seeds. Our crawler employed a breadth-first-search (BFS) approach to discover additional related apps recommended for each seed and other apps released by the same developer. To avoid regional bias, our crawler supported both English and Chinese languages.
- **Chinese App Markets**: Each Chinese app market indexes apps differently. For example, Baidu’s app market indexes apps incrementally. We adapted our crawler to match the indexing behavior of each market.

We launched several crawlers in parallel using 50 Aliyun Cloud Servers [37] between August 15 and August 30, 2017. To address the issue of frequent app updates, we implemented a "parallel search" strategy. When a new app (based on its package name) was identified in one of the 17 markets, we immediately searched for it in all remaining markets to crawl it simultaneously if found. All listed search results were added to the search seeds.

In April 2018, we conducted a second, one-week crawling campaign to check if any of the studied malicious apps had been removed from the individual stores (Section 7).

### Dataset

Table 1 reports the number of harvested APKs per store. We crawled metadata for 6,267,247 different apps across all app stores and 4,522,411 APK files. This dataset is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest cross-store APK collection obtained by the research community. The mismatch between app metadata and APKs is due to Google Play’s rate limiting mechanism, which limited our APK collection efforts to a random sample of 287,110. We used AndroZoo [11, 67] to obtain offline APK files for 1,553,382 of the missing Google Play apps, using the package name and version name as primary keys.

Although our BFS app crawling method has limitations, we believe our dataset covers the most popular apps in both Google Play and the Chinese markets. The parallel search strategy ensures that the apps studied across markets do not bias the results.

### General Overview

We now examine high-level characteristics of Google Play and the 16 Chinese app stores, using Google Play as a reference. We discuss differences along various dimensions such as catalog diversity, user downloads, Android API support, third-party libraries, and user ratings.

### App Categories

App stores allow developers to categorize their apps. However, each Android market uses a different taxonomy. While Google Play defines 33 app categories (excluding game subcategories), Huawei Market only has 18 categories. To perform a fair comparison, we manually developed a consolidated taxonomy with 22 app categories (Figure 1). Due to the lack of enforcement and lax supervision over the metadata provided by app developers, 40% of the apps in Tencent, 360, OPPO, and 25PP markets are classified as “Other.”

Games account for roughly 50% of all apps across markets, with other popular categories including Lifestyle and Personalization. The least popular categories are Browsers, InputMethods, and Security tools. The distribution of published apps across categories for most Chinese app stores closely follows Google Play’s distribution, with some vendor-specific stores (e.g., Meizu, Huawei, Lenovo) showing different distributions.

### User Downloads

Most app stores report the actual number of user installs per app, while Google Play bins them into installation ranges (e.g., “50,000 - 100,000”). Xiaomi and AppChina do not report this information. Some app stores might report user downloads instead of installs, potentially leading to higher numbers. For comparison, we normalized the number of user installed apps for each app store (excluding Xiaomi and AppChina) to Google Play’s ranges.

As Table 1 shows, apps in Google Play have 193 billion aggregated downloads. No single Chinese app store comes close to this volume, but the combined downloads across all 16 studied markets are three times higher than that of Google Play. This highlights the importance of Chinese Android markets when aggregated.

The distribution of app downloads follows a power-law distribution, regardless of the app market (Figure 2). Generally, 85% of the analyzed apps have less than 10K installs. The top 0.1% of apps account for more than 50% of total downloads, with subtle differences across stores. For example, the top 0.1% of apps in Tencent MyApp account for more than 80% of total downloads, while more than 55% of its published apps have almost no downloads.

### Third-Party Libraries

The presence of third-party services varies across app stores but remains high. Google Play has the highest presence of embedded third-party libraries (94% of published apps), while PC Online has the lowest (85%). Differences also appear in the total number of libraries per app, especially in vendor-provided app stores. The average app embeds more than 10 third-party libraries, with 360 market apps embedding 20 on average, compared to 8 for Google Play apps.

**Most Popular Third-Party Libraries:**
- **Google Play**: Google-related libraries for advertisement and analytics dominate, found in more than 60% of published apps.
- **Chinese Markets**: Despite Google services being blocked in China, Google-related advertising libraries are still present in more than a quarter of apps. Leading reasons include the lack of Chinese-specific versions and the practice of crawling apps from Google Play. Chinese-specific libraries like Tencent Wechat, Alipay, and Baidu are also widely used.

**Advertising Libraries:**
Identifying advertising libraries is challenging. We used AppBrain and Common Library classification [65] to identify and classify third-party ad libraries. Around 70% of apps in Google Play use labeled ad libraries, while 53.2% of apps in Chinese markets use at least one ad library. Google AdMob dominates Google Play, while the Chinese mobile ad ecosystem is more decentralized, with Google AdMob and Umeng accounting for 80% of the market share.

### App Ratings

Finally, we analyze how users rate published apps. Figure 6 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of app ratings for all considered markets. Two clear patterns emerge:

- **Pattern #1**: More than 80% of apps in Chinese third-party app markets do not receive user ratings, and around 90% of these apps have fewer than 1,000 downloads. This trend indicates that many apps in these markets are low-quality and unpopular.
- **Pattern #2**: Several markets (e.g., PC Online) have many apps with ratings between 2.5 and 3 out of 5. This may be due to a default rating of 3 instead of 0.

Google Play, in contrast, shows a different pattern: only 9.3% of apps have not been rated, and more than 50% have received ratings higher than 4.
