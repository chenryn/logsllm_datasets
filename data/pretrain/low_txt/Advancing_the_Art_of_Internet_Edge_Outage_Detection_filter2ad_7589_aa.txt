## Abstract
Measuring the reliability of edge networks in the Internet is challenging due to the vast size and heterogeneity of these networks, the rarity of outages, and the difficulty in finding vantage points that can accurately capture such events at scale. In this paper, we use logs from a major Content Delivery Network (CDN) detailing hourly request counts from address blocks. We discovered that many edge address blocks exhibit consistent hourly contact with the CDN over extended periods. We establish that a sudden, temporary absence of these requests indicates a loss of Internet connectivity for those address blocks, which we term "disruptions." We develop a disruption detection technique and present comprehensive statistics on 1.5 million disruption events over the course of a year. Our approach reveals that disruptions do not necessarily reflect actual service outages but can be the result of prefix migrations. Major natural disasters are clearly represented in our data as expected; however, a large share of detected disruptions correlate well with planned human interventions during scheduled maintenance intervals, suggesting they are unlikely to be caused by external factors. Cross-evaluating our results, we find that current state-of-the-art active outage detection methods overestimate the occurrence of disruptions in some address blocks. Our observations of disruptions, service outages, and their various causes have implications for the design of outage detection systems and for policymakers seeking to establish reporting requirements for Internet services.

## 1 Introduction
Residential Internet access has become critical: while packets were once exchanged over a connection designed for reliable voice communication, it is now common to provide myriad services, including voice, over a network built for best-effort data communication. Reliable Internet connectivity is increasingly necessary not only for individual users and their emergency communication needs or the operation of smart in-home devices but also for businesses that provide network services or sell to end-users. The growing criticality of the Internet is reflected in increased attention from governments and regulators around the globe to monitor and improve Internet reliability [38–41].

Despite the importance of continuous Internet access, there is a shortage of high-quality data that quantifies Internet reliability at the edge. Reliability is difficult to measure because true outages are rare events occurring within thousands of independently administered networks. Each network has unique management practices, resulting in different characteristics, making it challenging to develop methods to measure reliability at scale and to interpret the results. While these challenges apply to both residential and core networks, end-user network outages are particularly relevant due to the typical absence of global routing-protocol activity (§ 7). Prior approaches to measuring Internet edge reliability have either relied on deploying hardware in end-user premises [27, 52, 55] or on periodically sending probe traffic to specific IP addresses [25, 46, 54].

This paper introduces a new passive approach to detect Internet edge disruptions and outages using server logs from one of the world’s largest CDNs. This dataset offers several advantages over prior techniques: it samples the edge of the Internet broadly, favors actively used addresses, and relies on network traffic that is unlikely to be blocked. Our main contributions are:

- **Measurement Methodology:** We introduce a passive approach to detect disruptions in address activity based on CDN access logs. We leverage the observation that an increasing number of always-on devices (e.g., smartphones, smart TVs) result in constant, non-human-triggered request activity to CDN servers, which we call baseline activity. We establish that a temporary absence of these requests indicates a loss of Internet connectivity for given address blocks, which we refer to as disruptions. We develop and evaluate an approach to robustly detect such disruptions in our dataset, enabling us to continuously track disruptions on a broad scale and in detail, i.e., for individual IPv4 /24 address blocks. Comparing our approach to Trinocular [46], a state-of-the-art Internet-wide active outage detection technique, we find that Trinocular's outages must be filtered to be accurate, as false positives in a few address blocks can dominate.

- **Fine-grained Understanding of Disruptions:** We present detailed statistics on approximately 1.5 million detected disruption events spanning one year. We investigate disruption sizes, duration, frequency, and timing. While major external events like natural disasters are clearly represented in our datasets, we find that a large share of disruptions align well with scheduled ISP maintenance intervals and are unlikely to be caused by external factors. We illustrate our findings with a case study of major US broadband ISPs.

- **Disruptions vs. Service Outages:** We use an orthogonal dataset to track the activity of individual devices across address blocks during disruptions. Our analysis reveals that at least 10% of disruption events do not reflect actual service outages but rather large-scale prefix migrations. We discover that temporary prefix migrations often result in massive anti-disruption events, sudden shifts in prefix activity. We develop techniques to detect anti-disruptions at the per-AS level and pinpoint networks prone to such behavior, which can bias outage detection mechanisms. We study the extent to which publicly available BGP data captures detected disruptions, finding that BGP hides about 80% of identified disruptions, and even a BGP withdrawal of a prefix does not necessarily indicate an actual service outage.

Our findings challenge common assumptions in the field of Internet edge outage detection, such as how to determine if a measured event really corresponds to a service outage. They also challenge the interpretation of such results, given that disruptions and outages can be caused by a variety of factors, whether a planned service maintenance should be interpreted similarly to a service outage caused by unplanned internal or external events.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: We introduce definitions and discuss related work in Section 2. In Section 3, we show how we can leverage baseline activity in the CDN logs to identify disruptions, introduce our detection mechanism, and compare it against state-of-the-art active outage detection. We study identified disruption events on a broad scale in Section 4. We then shift our perspective and drill into details of disruption events from a device-centric perspective in Section 5. We discover and analyze the phenomenon of anti-disruptions in Section 6 and assess ways to distinguish disruptions from service outages in Section 7. We illustrate our findings with a case study of major US ISPs in Section 8 and discuss the pertinent implications of our work in Section 9.

## 2 On Detecting Edge Outages
In this section, we introduce necessary terminology and discuss the current state-of-the-art in Internet edge outage detection.

### 2.1 Defining Outages
In this work, we introduce a rigorous distinction between a detectable symptom of a service outage and the outage itself, and we consider possible alternative causes of that symptom. We define the following terms:

- **Disruption:** A temporary loss of Internet connectivity of specific IP address blocks.
- **Outage:** A disruption that results in the loss of the Internet access service that had been provided to the end devices in the affected address blocks.

A disruption may be the measurable consequence of an outage, but a disruption does not always imply that an actual outage occurred. For example, a disruption occurs when the public IP addresses associated with end hosts are changed, and the prior addresses are not immediately assigned to other devices—an outage need not have occurred. There are different datasets and methods to detect disruptions in the Internet, including the measurement of BGP announcements and withdrawals, sudden loss of ICMP responsiveness for specific address blocks, and sudden drops in traffic from/to specific address blocks.

### 2.2 Related Work
Internet failures affecting the core of the network have been well studied using data-plane techniques [13, 43], control-plane techniques [26, 35], or combinations of both [23, 32–34]. Other works have investigated external sources such as router logs [59] and mailing lists [11] to study infrastructure outages.

Failures affecting the edge have been studied at smaller scales using measurement agents deployed at user premises [10, 15, 16, 27, 55]. These agents are typically dedicated hardware devices, such as SamKnows [52] and BISmark [58] routers and RIPE Atlas probes [50], although some approaches use measurements from software deployed on user systems [10, 53, 56] or a combination of hardware and software [16]. Such approaches can offer detailed and accurate reports about Internet reliability since the agents are designed to execute measurements continuously as long as they are powered. However, the cost and logistical difficulties of deploying measurement agents to users severely limit their scalability.

To detect outages at scale, studies have investigated actively probing destinations from vantage points and using probe responses—or lack thereof—as signals for edge outages. Thunderping analyzes the effect of weather on residential networks [54] by pinging residential IP addresses in geographic areas subject to severe weather. Trinocular [46] models the responsiveness of routed /24 prefixes using historical data [28] and sends ICMP probes to 4 million routed /24 prefixes to detect disruptions. By applying Bayesian inference to responses, Trinocular detects a disruption affecting a prefix when it finds that the prefix has become unresponsive according to its model. We evaluate our results against Trinocular in § 3.7.

Dainotti et al. detect Internet outages at the country level by identifying times of reduced traffic from addresses in certain countries toward unused IPv4 address space [22]. Traffic to unused portions of the IPv4 address space is often sent by misconfigured devices or malicious hosts [12] who may spoof their source addresses, making it difficult to infer if addresses sending traffic to the darknet are actively in use by user devices.

Prior work has interpreted intermittently inactive addresses or address blocks (i.e., what we term disruptions) as outages [22, 46, 54]. A key aspect that differentiates our work is that we seek to further investigate whether detected disruptions result in service outages.
