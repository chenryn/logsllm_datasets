### 2.4.12.2 IN
- **Expression**: `expression IN (subquery)`
- **Result**:
  - `TRUE` if any row in the subquery matches the left-hand expression.
  - `FALSE` if no matching row is found, including when the subquery returns no rows.
  - `NULL` if the left-hand expression yields `NULL`, or if there are no equal right-hand values and at least one right-hand row yields `NULL`. This aligns with SQL's rules for Boolean combinations of null values.
- **Note**: Do not assume that the subquery will be fully evaluated.

### 2.4.12.3 NOT IN
- **Expression**: `expression NOT IN (subquery)`
- **Result**:
  - `TRUE` if all rows in the subquery do not match the left-hand expression, including when the subquery returns no rows.
  - `FALSE` if any row in the subquery matches the left-hand expression.
  - `NULL` if the left-hand expression yields `NULL`, or if there are no equal right-hand values and at least one right-hand row yields `NULL`. This aligns with SQL's rules for Boolean combinations of null values.
- **Note**: Do not assume that the subquery will be fully evaluated.

### 2.4.12.4 ANY/SOME
- **Expression**:
  - `expression operator ANY (subquery)`
  - `expression operator SOME (subquery)`
- **Result**:
  - `TRUE` if the operator evaluates to `TRUE` for any row in the subquery.
  - `FALSE` if the operator evaluates to `FALSE` for all rows in the subquery, including when the subquery returns no rows.
  - `NULL` if there are no successful comparisons and at least one right-hand row yields `NULL` for the operator's result. This aligns with SQL's rules for Boolean combinations of null values.
- **Note**: 
  - `SOME` is a synonym for `ANY`.
  - `IN` is equivalent to `= ANY`.
  - Do not assume that the subquery will be fully evaluated.

### 2.4.12.5 ALL
- **Expression**: `expression operator ALL (subquery)`
- **Result**:
  - `TRUE` if the operator evaluates to `TRUE` for all rows in the subquery, including when the subquery returns no rows.
  - `FALSE` if the operator evaluates to `FALSE` for any row in the subquery.
  - `NULL` if the comparison does not return `FALSE` for any row, and it returns `NULL` for at least one row.
- **Note**: 
  - `NOT IN` is equivalent to `<> ALL`.
  - Do not assume that the subquery will be fully evaluated.
