### Methodology and Timeline of the Forensic Statistical Tool (FST)

**Affidavit of Eugene Lien, OCME Assistant Director, July 17, 2017:**
"The methodology of the program did not require submission to the Commission on Forensic Science or the DNA Subcommittee."

**Key Dates:**
- **December 2010:** Approval
- **April 2011:** Initial Online Deployment
- **April 2011:** Offline Period
- **April-June 2011:** Modifications
- **July 2011:** Re-online
- **October 2016:** Independent Report
- **January 2017:** Acknowledgment
- **October 2017:** Protective Order Vacated

**Reauthorization and Performance Checks:**
Following performance checks, FST was reauthorized for casework.

### Source Code and Legal Context

**United States v. Kevin Johnson:**
- Source code provided under a protective order.
- **Assistant US Attorneys, January 2017:**
  "FST disregards the information from any locus in a sample if the alleles present at that locus reflect 97% or more of the alleles in the overall population for that locus."

### Data and Statistical Weight

**Reference Evidence:**
- **Statistical Weight:** The evidence is approximately 70.6 times more probable.
- **Hypotheses:**
  - \( H_p \): If the sample originated from the reference profile and two unknown, unrelated persons.
  - \( H_d \): If it originated from three unknown, unrelated persons.

**Validation and Review:**
- **2010 Validation (non-contributor):** 15/15 locations
- **2016 Review (same data):** 15/15 locations
- **2016 Review (reduced data):** 12/15 locations
- **Comparison:**
  - 157 ≠ 70.6
  - 70.6 = 70.6

**False Positive Value:**
- A false positive value became less incriminating.
- **Likelihood Ratios (LR):**
  - LR > 1 supports inclusion as a contributor.
  - LR < 1 supports exclusion as a contributor.
  - Removing data at 3 loci:
    - Exclusionary: 0.53
    - Inclusionary: 3.1, 1.3

### Quality Control and Public Access

**Quality Control Test (FST Version 2.0, June 2011):**
- First made public in October 2017.
- **Re-evaluation:**
  - Twelve samples previously evaluated with FST in August 2010 were re-evaluated.
  - Two samples had one locus each that displayed values leading to their removal.
- **FOIL Request (June 2018):**
  - Records from 16 additional "Quality Control Tests" were produced.
  - `checkFrequencyForRemoval()` function: ~70 lines, including comments and whitespace.

### Case Study: Washington v. Emmanuel Fair

**TrueAllele® System:**
- **Declaration of Dr. Mark Perlin, TrueAllele® Developer:**
  "There is no way to actually use source code in a validation study, which tests the reliability of an executable computer program."
- **Declaration of Dr. Michael Gorin, Professor of Medicine, UCLA:**
  "Since it is essential that one conducts testing with a compiled and operational version of the software, there is no benefit (nor justification) in providing individuals with the source code unless they intend to modify it."
- **Declaration of Thomas Hebert, DNA Technical Leader for Baltimore Police:**
  "In my opinion, I do not believe the source code is necessary for determining the reliability of TrueAllele because source code is not normally used in the validation of software programs for forensic use."
- **Declaration of Dr. Kevin Miller, former Lab Director of Kern Regional Crime Lab (CA):**
  - "DNA analysts are required by national mandate to have taken only one statistics class and have no computer science educational requirements. Therefore, this level of mathematics and engineering is above most individuals who work in the field."
  - "It strikes me as highly irregular that any one particular step in any one particular workflow would suddenly become singled out as an issue for source code revelation. If one is to discuss error in DNA testing, then would one not want to capture an error rate for the entire workflow?"

### Independent Testing and Transparency

**Challenges:**
- **Access to Executables:**
  - Cost
  - Not sold to individuals or groups outside law enforcement
  - Difficulty in obtaining old copies of software
  - Trade secret protection
- **Terms of Service:**
  - Limit publishing of results
  - Prevent third-party review
- **Need for Natural Repositories:**
  - Connect defense teams with experts
  - Share and document relevant bugs

**Procurement Phase Wishlist:**
- **Public Funding:**
  - Require or give credit for source code and software artifacts
  - No clauses preventing third-party review or publishing of defects
  - Access to executables for third-party testing
  - Scriptable interfaces for automated testing
  - Bug bounties
- **Fund Non-Profit Third-Party Entities:**
  - Conduct independent testing

**Bigger Picture:**
- **Algorithmic Transparency and Accountability:**
  - Awareness
  - Access and redress
  - Accountability
  - Explanation
  - Data provenance
  - Audit-ability
  - Validation and testing
- **Provide Evidence:**
  - Improve systems for all stakeholders
  - Avoid running society on buggy or malicious algorithms hidden from view
