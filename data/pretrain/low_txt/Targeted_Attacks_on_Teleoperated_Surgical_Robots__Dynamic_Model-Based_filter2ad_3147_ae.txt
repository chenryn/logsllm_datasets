### A. Security of Teleoperated Surgical Robots

Previous research on the security of telerobotic surgical systems has primarily focused on network and communication-based attacks. Bonaci et al. conducted an experimental analysis of various cybersecurity attacks on the communication between the surgeon's console and the robot, using the RAVEN II platform [8]. They evaluated threats posed by attacks that modify or manipulate the surgeon's intent or hijack control of the robot. Their findings indicated that delaying or losing user input packets in transit to the robot could result in jerky motions of the robotic arms or difficulties in performing tasks by human operators. However, the modification of packet contents was detected by the safety software, which then stopped the robot's electrical and mechanical components, preventing harm to the patient.

Tozal et al. developed a Secure and Statistically Reliable UDP (SSR-UDP) protocol to ensure the confidentiality and reliability of telesurgical communications in wireless environments [5]. Lee et al. proposed Secure ITP, a security enhancement for the Interoperable Telesurgery Protocol (ITP), which introduces Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram TLS (DTLS) protocols to authenticate the teleoperation console, the slave robot, and the surgeon and patient [6].

Most previous studies assumed that compromising a surgeon's control console or the robot control system is less likely due to strict physical access monitoring [8]. Coble et al. were among the few who explored the possibility of compromising the robot software in unattended environments, such as battlefields. They suggested remote verification of system software and configuration files before execution, using remote software attestation [34].

### B. Attacks on Hospital Networks

In this work, we assume that attackers exploit existing vulnerabilities in hospital networks, as described in previous research, to gain access to telerobotic surgical systems without being detected by regular security monitoring mechanisms, such as intrusion detection systems or remote software attestation techniques. Table V summarizes recent reports on real-world attacks on hospital networks.

For example, TrapX Security Inc. recently discovered three targeted attacks on a hospital's network that bypassed antivirus software, intrusion detection systems, and firewalls. In one case, vulnerabilities in a blood gas analyzer were exploited to establish a backdoor to the entire hospital network, allowing attackers to install malware and steal patient data records. In another case, attackers gained unauthorized access to a clinic workstation by stealing credentials from an employee who visited a malicious website and installed malware on the machine [10]. In a recent study on a wide range of medical devices in several hospitals, researchers from Essentia Health found that internal firewalls used to protect surgical robots from external connections might crash when running a vulnerability scanner, enabling unauthorized access to the robot [11]. Additionally, several recalls and adverse events have been reported to the FDA involving random attacks on hospital networks where malware or viruses infected medical devices, such as imaging systems, causing interruptions in patient therapy [39][40].

### VI. Conclusion

In this paper, we described the anatomy of targeted attacks against the control systems of teleoperated surgical robots. We demonstrated these attacks on the RAVEN II surgical robot and experimentally evaluated their impact on the operation of the robot control system and patient safety. Our results showed that the attacks can cause either sudden jumps of the robotic arms or unavailability of the system due to an unwanted transition to a halt state in the middle of surgery. We presented defense mechanisms that combine an understanding of the semantics of both software and physical components to predict the adverse consequences of attacks within the real-time constraints of the control system. The mitigation and assessment methods presented here can be applied to the safety and security validation of a wider range of safety-critical cyber-physical systems.
