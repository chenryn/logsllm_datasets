### 3. Related Work

The work reported in [34] also exploits physical properties to provide a secure localization mechanism for wireless sensor networks, without relying on redundancy. Numerous studies in the literature have described and implemented countermeasures for passive attacks (e.g., eavesdropping), particularly in the RFID domain. For instance, in [37] and [29], the eavesdropper is detected through power leakage, such as from oscillators, provided that such power measurements can be obtained. In contrast, PyCRA does not assume the existence of power consumption side-channels. Instead, the experiments shown in Figure 10 demonstrate an environment with only a passive eavesdropping antenna and no power leakage.

Another example is the work in [11], which considers an active relay attack where the attacker actively sends information. The detection scheme is based on detecting the act of sending. As discussed earlier, our system is designed to handle completely passive attacks. However, PyCRA is not designed to protect against a passive eavesdropper that measures backscattered waves, as discussed in [12] (compared to magnetic coupling eavesdropping). Typically, RFID range is small, and we argue that PyCRA provides security for short-range operations. Some ideas from the literature can complement the contributions of PyCRA.

### 8.2 Physics, Randomness, & Security

The underlying principles of PyCRA utilize accurate mathematical models that capture the physics and dynamics of active sensors. With these models, PyCRA can isolate the response of the attacker from the response of the environment when challenged by the proposed secure sensor. The success of the system presented in this paper supports the concept of physical challenge-response authentication as a whole. Section 1 briefly mentioned several additional sensing modalities where PyCRA can provide enhanced security. Adapting the methods described in this work to these sensors is feasible—revisiting the physical models involved can help derive a method for probing the physical environment and measuring the environmental response.

The results from the previous sections highlight the key strengths of PyCRA: it uses fundamental properties of physics (physical delays and noise) along with mathematical models to provide the following security benefits:
1. Timely and accurate detection of external, potentially malicious sources of signal interference.
2. Resilience via accurate estimation of malicious spectra.
3. Accurate detection of passive eavesdropping attacks.

These security mechanisms are bolstered by physical limitations such as delays (\(\tau_{\text{attack}}\)) and change point detection, for which we have derived theoretical guarantees.

Another significant factor in the security provided by PyCRA is the amount of randomness used in generating the physical challenges. The relationship between randomness and security is a well-known one, appearing in most cryptographic security protocols. However, a fundamental difference in PyCRA is that it relies solely on private randomness, unlike shared randomness in classical cryptographic authentication schemes. This is due to the "passivity" property of the measured entity exploited by PyCRA, which eliminates the problem of random data distribution (e.g., key distribution) and thus enhances the security provided by the system.

### 8.3 Overcoming Negative Effects of PyCRA

A PyCRA-secured sensor may occasionally cease measurement of the physical phenomena it is monitoring, which can negatively affect overall sensor performance. However, measuring any physical phenomenon requires a sampling rate dictated by its bandwidth (e.g., 50 Hz for magnetic encoders), while electronics can operate much faster (e.g., 10 kHz in our experiments). We exploit this by performing authentication using oversampling, thereby conducting multiple authentications within a single physics-dictated sampling period. Once the sensor is authenticated, we can select any of the authenticated measurements collected within the sampling period and provide this as the 'secure' sensor measurement without affecting performance.

If the sensor detects an attack, then attack-resilient estimation/computation (as shown in Section 7) needs to be carried out. These computations operate at a higher sampling rate, which increases power consumption. However, this is a reasonable trade-off for enhanced security.

### 9. Conclusion

We have presented PyCRA, a physical challenge-response authentication method for active sensors. The core concept behind PyCRA is that, through random physical stimulation and subsequent behavior analysis, we can determine whether a sensor is under attack and, in some cases, remain resilient to attacks. This work further describes how the PyCRA scheme can be applied to (1) passive eavesdropping attacks, (2) simple spoofing attacks, and (3) more advanced spoofing attacks. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of PyCRA in over 90 experiments on physical hardware, focusing on three case studies: magnetic encoder attack detection, magnetic encoder attack resilience, and RFID eavesdropping detection. Our results from these case studies indicate that physical challenge-response authentication can accurately and reliably detect and mitigate malicious attacks at the analog sensor level. Finally, we believe the results discussed in this work support the notion of physical challenge-response systems in general, advocating their adoption for active sensors where secure operation is critical. More broadly, PyCRA offers security to a wide array of systems (not just sensors) where inputs are mapped to outputs by well-understood models.
