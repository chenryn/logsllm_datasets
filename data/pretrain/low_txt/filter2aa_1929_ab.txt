# Logging and Event Management in Windows Vista

## Asynchronous Logging
- **Asynchronous Operation**: Logging is asynchronous, ensuring that it does not block the application.
- **Log Size Limitation**: The log size is no longer limited; it is constrained only by available disk space.

## Log Structure
- **Record Header**
- **Section Descriptor**
- **Section Header**
- **Section Body**
  - This structure repeats as needed for each section of the log.

## Filtering and Subscriptions
- **XPath for Filtering**:
  - `Event[System/EventID=101]`: Selects events with a specific event ID.
  - `Event[System/Provider=Foo]`: Filters events by provider.
  - `Event[System/Level>2]`: Filters events by severity level.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Filtering can be applied to live logs, files, and across different versions of Windows (Vista and XP).
- **Centralized Custom Views**: Users can subscribe to custom views of events, integrating seamlessly with existing tools.

## Triggering Actions
- **Task Association**: Users can associate tasks with events with a single click.

## Vista Log Signature
- **Header**: The header starts with "ElfFile" and is 4K in size.
- **Block Markers**: Each 64K block starts with "ElfChnk".
- **Total Size**: 1024 + 4 = 1028 K bytes.

## Registering a Provider
- **Providers as Event Sources**: Providers are identified by a unique GUID and name.
- **Resource Location**: Specifies the location of resources for decoding.

## Channel Definition
- **System-Defined Channels**: These channels are imported.
- **Custom Channels**: New provider-specific channels can be defined and configured.

## Template Definition
- **Payload Shape**: Templates define the structure of event data.
- **User-Defined XML**: Custom XML representations can be added for the payload.

## Event Manifest
- **Attributes**: Defines event attributes such as ID, version, keywords, task, opcode, and level.
- **Template Reference**: References a previously declared template for instance data.
- **Message**: A user-readable string.
- **Channel**: The name of the channel that transports the event to the logs.

## Logging Interface
- **Compile-Time Steps**:
  - Write a schema.
  - Compile the schema.
- **Run-Time Steps**:
  - Register the source.
  - Create a session.
  - Send events.
- **Publishing API**:
  - Facilitates event publishing from both user and kernel modes.

## Roadmap
- **Background and Case Study**: Includes engagement, preliminary results, and revised scope.
- **Vista Event Logging**: Covers events, logging service, and undocumented internals.
- **Event Log Analysis**: Focuses on recovery, correlation, and reporting.
- **Shadow Copy Services**: Details the functionality and impact on forensics.

## Forensic Process Models
- **Repair, Correlate, Recover, Extract, Analyze, Interpret**:
  - **Recover**: Data carving for logs.
  - **Validate**: Identifying intact log files.
  - **Correlate**: Matching time, files, and names.
  - **Analyze and Interpret**: Interpreting the recovered and correlated data.

## Using DataLifter
- **Results**:
  - 100 logs recovered, but only two are viewable.
  - 98 corrupt logs need validation.

## Vista Event Viewer
- **New Features**: Includes views and filters.

## SQL Queries for Correlation
- **Pattern Identification**:
  - `[System/Provider="CD Burning Service"]`

## Shortcuts
- **Attributes**: Contains IDs, labels, and sizes.
- **Snapshot**: Captures file and media attributes.
- **Example**:
  - File: D:\OfInterest.doc
  - Last Access Time: 11/3/2006 10:12:34 AM
  - Last Write Time: 11/11/2006 3:21:14 PM
  - Creation Time: 1643743
  - Volume Serial Number: E2C3-F184
  - Volume Label: Nov 11 2006
  - Volume Type: CD-ROM

## Report
- **Correlations**:
  - A CD-ROM was burned by Bob at 11/11/2006 3:21 PM UTC.
  - The CD is uniquely identified by the label "Nov 11 2006" and volume serial number E2C3-F184.
  - Proprietary documents were transferred, including OfInterest.doc (1.6 Mb, last modified 11/3/2006 10:12:34 AM UTC).

## Timestamp Analysis
- **Indicators**:
  - Last write time earlier than creation time can indicate file transfer from source media.
  - Helps identify the source file on the source media.

## Shadow Copy Services
- **Automatic Point-in-Time Copies**: Incremental block-level differences minimize space.
- **Space Management**: Deletes older copies as needed using LRU (Least Recently Used) policy.

## Legal Concerns
- **Revised Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP)**:
  - Scope of production, duty to preserve, and form of production.
  - Historical snapshots are readily available in Vista, complicating document retention policies.

## Impact on Policy Maintenance
- **Corporate Policy Issues**:
  - Disabling shadow copies can break backups and restore engines.
  - Metadata retention and ownership changes are more visible, requiring updated documentation policies.

## Impact on Forensics
- **FRCP Changes**: Vista changes the rules, leaving more information than XP.
- **SOX Compliance and Litigation Risks**: Executives may face surprises due to increased visibility.

## How Shadow Copy Works
- **Layered Architecture**: Acts as a layer between the device and file system.
- **Snapshots**: Captures incremental changes over time.
- **Write Operations**: Overwritten blocks move to the shadow copy, which holds only changed blocks.

## Enabling Shadow Copies
- **Steps and Commands**:
  - Use `vssadmin` for managing shadow copies.
  - Use `volrest` for restoring previous versions of files.

## Tools
- **vssadmin**: Manages volume shadow copies.
- **volrest**: Restores previous versions of files.
