### Trusted Voting Systems and Security Challenges

Rivest and Wack [52] address the issue of complexity in voting systems by proposing that they should be software-independent. This means that an undetected change or error in the software should not cause an undetectable change or error in the election outcome. Some mechanisms for achieving software independence, such as rigorous post-election audits of paper ballots in a precinct-count optical scan system, also protect against hardware changes. However, it is possible for a system to be software-independent while still being vulnerable to hardware attacks like those described in this document.

The complexity of Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) voting systems has been a significant source of vulnerability, but it is not the only one. As demonstrated, DREs can be tampered with by substituting dishonest hardware components or by altering the internal state of the machine using malicious hardware devices. Simplicity alone cannot solve DRE security problems. Furthermore, overly simple designs may make it impossible to apply certain defenses, such as cryptographic integrity and confidentiality protections. Very simple and inexpensive hardware designs are also more susceptible to reverse engineering and tampering.

The maximum security in electronic voting systems is likely to come from a balanced approach—designs that use complexity intelligently, where it strengthens the system. Much other work has examined hardware attacks outside the context of voting (e.g., [37, 55]) and the general problem of security in embedded systems (e.g., [2, 12, 51]).

Several authors have proposed end-to-end verifiable cryptographic voting systems (e.g., [14–16, 43, 46]), which allow voters to independently check that their votes have been counted correctly. While these schemes hold great promise, it remains to be seen whether they can be adapted for use under the challenging conditions of Indian elections.

### Conclusions

Despite elaborate safeguards, India’s Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) remain vulnerable to serious attacks. Dishonest insiders or other criminals with physical access to the machines can insert malicious hardware that can steal votes for the lifetime of the machines. Attackers with physical access between voting and counting can arbitrarily change vote totals and determine which candidate each voter selected.

These problems are deeply rooted. The design of India’s EVMs relies entirely on the physical security of the machines and the integrity of election insiders, negating many of the security benefits of using electronic voting. The technology was intended to make attacks on the ballot box and dishonesty in the counting process more difficult. However, we find that such attacks remain possible and potentially more difficult to detect.

It is highly doubtful that these problems can be remedied by simple upgrades to the existing EVMs or election procedures. Making the attacks we have demonstrated more difficult will not fix the fundamental problem: India’s EVMs do not provide transparency, so voters and election officials have no reason to be confident that the machines are behaving honestly.

India should carefully reconsider how to achieve a secure and transparent voting system that aligns with its national values and requirements. One option, adopted in other countries, is to use a voter-verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT), which combines an electronic record stored in a DRE with a paper vote record that can be audited by hand [42]. Existing EVMs do not have updatable software, but it would be possible to add a VVPAT by interposing on the cable between the control unit and the ballot unit. Another option is precinct-count optical scan (PCOS) voting, where voters fill out paper ballots that are scanned by a voting machine at the polling station before being placed in a ballot box. Attacking either of these systems would require tampering with both the paper records and the electronic records, provided that routine audits are performed to ensure these redundant sets of records agree [11]. A third option is to return to simple paper ballots. Despite their known weaknesses, simple paper ballots provide a high degree of transparency, making fraud more likely to be detected.

Using EVMs in India may have seemed like a good idea when the machines were introduced in the 1980s, but our understanding of electronic voting security—and the attacks against it—has advanced dramatically since then. Other technologically advanced countries have adopted and then abandoned EVM-style voting. Now that we better understand what technology can and cannot do, any new solutions to the very real problems election officials face must address the issues, not merely hide them from sight.
