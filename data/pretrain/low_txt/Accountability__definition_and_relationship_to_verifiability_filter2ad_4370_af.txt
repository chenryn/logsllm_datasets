### Optimized Text

Each participant \( T \) runs a single instance of their role, as specified by the protocol, and can handle up to three requests. The judge, who is assumed to be honest, blames \( T \) if and only if they receive a message of the form \(\langle a_T, r_T \rangle\) for some contract. For the PASW protocol, we define \(\alpha\) as the set of runs where the judge \( J \) receives a message of the form \(\langle a_T, r_T \rangle\), indicating that \( J \) is faced with both \( a_T \) and \( r_T \). Let \(\Phi\) consist of the accountability constraint \(\alpha \Rightarrow \text{dis}(T)\). We obtain the following theorem:

**Theorem 4.** \( J \) ensures \(\Phi\)-accountability for PASW.

Following Remark 1, we verified Theorem 4 automatically using the protocol analysis tool by Millen and Shmatikov [36] (see [33] for our formal modeling). As mentioned, the completeness condition is rather trivial in this case.

### Appendix

#### A. The Bingo Voting System

##### A.1 Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Bingo Voting

Here, we describe the zero-knowledge proofs used in the tallying phase and the initialization phase of the Bingo Voting system in more detail.

**ZK-proofs in the tallying phase:**

For each receipt, the following steps are performed:
1. The voting machine generates a new commitment on the pair \((j, r)\), where \( j \) is the chosen candidate and \( r \) is the number generated by the RNG and printed next to \( j \).
2. All the commitments for the receipt are published in a random order. One of them is the commitment just described, and the other \((l - 1)\) commitments are unopened commitments published on the bulletin board during the initialization phase. Different receipts use different commitments from the bulletin board.
3. These commitments are re-randomized and shuffled twice. Both the intermediate and final sets of commitments are published.
4. The final commitments are opened. An observer can check that there is exactly one commitment for each candidate and that all numbers shown on the receipt were contained in the final commitments.
5. Finally, the auditors choose a random bit in a distributed way, see, e.g., [15]. Depending on the value of this bit, the voting machine publishes the random factors for the first or second re-randomization step.

If the voting machine attempts to cheat, it will be detected with a probability of at least 50%. This probability can be increased to \(1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^s\) by repeating the procedure \( s \) times.

**ZK-proofs in the initialization phase:**

This proof was not precisely defined in [10], but it can be implemented using randomized partial checking, similar to the zero-knowledge proof in the tallying phase. We assume that a commitment \(\text{comm}(j, x_j^i)\) on a pair \((j, x_j^i)\) is implemented as \((C_j^i, D_j^i)\), where the commitments on the single components are Pedersen commitments. To show that among the published commitments, there are exactly \( n \) of the form \(\text{comm}(j, x_j^i)\) for every candidate \( j \), the zero-knowledge proof proceeds similarly to the tallying phase, except that it only uses the first component \( C_j^i \) of a commitment.

##### A.2 Modeling of the Bingo Voting Protocol

The modeling of the Bingo Voting system is based on a detailed specification. The commitment \(\text{comm}(j, x_j^i)\) is implemented as \((C_j^i, D_j^i)\).
