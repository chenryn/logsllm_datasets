### Time Periods and Estimated Values

The estimated values for specific time periods were either rejected or not obtained. Specifically, for the in-house system, the values for the time period \( j \geq 36 \) were not estimated. For the LANL HPC system, this occurred for \( j \geq 7 \), and for the NERSC Seaborg system, it was for \( j \geq 52 \). The estimation issues arose due to divergence problems when solving a two-dimensional linear equation using the Newton-Raphson method.

For the in-house system and the LANL HPC system, some estimated values were rejected, while no rejections occurred for the NERSC Seaborg system. More precisely, the values for the time periods \( 37 \leq j \leq 82 \), \( 102 \leq j \leq 141 \), and \( 196 \leq j \leq 261 \) for the in-house system, and \( 8 \leq j \leq 2097 \) for the LANL HPC system, were rejected. Here, \( j \) denotes the time index, which corresponds to the number of samples used to estimate the T-year return values.

### Fluctuations and Stability of T-Year Return Values

Although the estimated T-year return values fluctuate over time, these fluctuations are smaller than those of the sample average of repair times shown in Figure 4. Additionally, Figure 6(c) indicates periods where the estimated value does not fluctuate at all, suggesting that the estimation of the T-year return value for the NERSC Seaborg system is robust. The estimated T-year return value for the LANL HPC system declines slowly, while the values for the in-house system and the NERSC Seaborg system remain statistically stable over time. This slow convergence for the LANL HPC system is likely due to the large number of observed samples.

### Conclusion

Studying the statistical properties of repair times requires a large number of data samples. We analyzed the tail distribution of repair times for three large IT systems using systematically collected data. Our findings indicate that the repair times for these systems follow quasi-heavy-tailed distributions, suggesting that the sample repair time estimated at a certain time could change dramatically if observed over different periods. Indeed, the sample mean and variance of the repair times for the three IT systems showed significant fluctuations and did not converge over several years.

Given that the mean time to repair is not a robust metric for evaluating IT system availability, we propose a new method using the T-year return value. We calculated the T-year return value for the three IT systems by modeling the repair time with the Generalized Pareto distribution. The 1-year and 1-month return values for the three systems were found to be close to the expected values, indicating that the T-year return value can reliably predict the value that the repair time exceeds on average once in T years.
