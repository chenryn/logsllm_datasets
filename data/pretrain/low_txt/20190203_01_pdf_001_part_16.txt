### Adding and Managing Filter Rules

In the Filter dialog box, enter a descriptive filter name and the filter clause to select the rows you wish to replicate. The filter name and filter clause must meet the following conditions:

1. For any given table or view, each filter rule must be assigned a unique filter name.
2. For any given table or view, the filter clauses must have different syntaxes (i.e., the filtering criteria must be distinct).

#### Example: Filtering Rows in the DEPT Table

In the following example, a filter rule is defined for the `DEPT` table to include only rows where the `deptno` column contains 10, 20, or 30. All other rows are excluded from replication.

#### Example: Filtering Rows in the EMP Table

Similarly, a filter rule can be added to the `EMP` table by selecting `EDB.EMP` from the Table/View drop-down list and entering the selection criteria for rows with `deptno` containing 10 in the Filter dialog box.

By repeating this process, additional filter rules can be added for the `EMP` table. The complete set of available filter rules for the `DEPT` and `EMP` tables is shown below.

#### Removing and Modifying Filter Rules

To remove a filter rule, click the primary mouse button on the filter rule you wish to remove, highlight the entry, and then click the Remove Filter button.

You can also modify the filter name or filter clause of a filter rule listed in the Table Filters tab by double-clicking on the cell of the filter name or filter clause you wish to change. When the cursor appears in the cell, enter the new text.

When creating a subscription, you may selectively enable these table filters on the corresponding subscription tables. See Section 5.3.3 for more information on creating a subscription.

**Step 4: Click the Create button.** If "Publication Created Successfully" appears, click the OK button. Otherwise, investigate the error and make the necessary corrections.

Upon successful publication creation, a Publication node is added to the replication tree.

### Control Schema Objects Created for a Publication

After adding a publication database definition and publications, the following control schema objects are created in addition to your original publication tables and views:

- **Control Schema Organization:** In the publication database, control schema objects are created to manage the xDB replication systems. The organization of these objects under the physical database schemas depends on the publication database server type (e.g., Oracle, SQL Server, or Postgres).
- **Trigger-Based Synchronization Replication:** If the publication is not a snapshot-only publication and synchronization replication is implemented using the trigger-based method, three triggers and one shadow table are created for each publication table as part of the control schema.
- **Log-Based Synchronization Replication:** If the publication uses log-based synchronization replication, a single trigger is created for each publication table as part of the control schema.

Do not manually delete any of these database objects, as it will corrupt the replication system control schema. When you remove publications and publication database definitions using the xDB Replication Console or xDB Replication Server CLI, the control schema objects are deleted during the removal process.

#### Oracle Control Schema Objects

The control schema objects created in the publication database user’s schema (the control schema) are listed below:

```sql
SQL> CONNECT pubuser/password
Connected.
SQL> SET PAGESIZE 9999
SQL> SELECT table_name FROM user_tables ORDER BY table_name;
```

**Types:**

**Note:**
- Tables named according to the convention `RRST_schema_table` (e.g., `RRST_EDB_DEPT`, `RRST_EDB_EMP`) are found only for synchronization publications.
- Triggers named according to the conventions `RRPD_schema_table`, `RRPI_schema_table`, and `RRPU_schema_table` (e.g., `RRPU_EDB_DEPT`, `RRPI_EDB_DEPT`, `RRPD_EDB_DEPT`, `RRPI_EDB_EMP`, `RRPU_EDB_EMP`, `RRPD_EDB_EMP`) are found only for synchronization publications.

For a snapshot-only publication, the control schema objects would look like the following:

```sql
SQL> CONNECT pubuser/password
Connected.
SQL> SET PAGESIZE 9999
SQL> SELECT table_name FROM user_tables ORDER BY table_name;
```
