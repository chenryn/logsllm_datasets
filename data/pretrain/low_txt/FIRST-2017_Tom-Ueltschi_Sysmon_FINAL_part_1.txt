## Outline
1. Introduction to Sysmon and Public Resources
2. Brief Recap of BotConf Talk with Examples
3. Threat Hunting & Advanced Detection Examples
   - Malware Delivery – Persistence Methods
   - Internal Recon – Lateral Movement
   - Internal Peer-to-Peer C2 using Named Pipes
   - Detecting Mimikatz (even file-less / in-memory)

---

## Standing on the Shoulders of Giants
- It's challenging to come up with entirely new ideas and approaches.
- Leverage existing resources and knowledge.
- Share experiences and best practices.

---

## Pyramid of Pain
- Aim to detect and mitigate high-impact threats.

---

## Sqrrl on Threat Hunting
- Most examples will be covered in this section.

---

## MITRE ATT&CK Matrix
- **Tactics Covered:**
  - Persistence (Registry, Filesystem)
  - Discovery / Lateral Movement / Execution (WMI)
  - Command and Control (Named Pipes)
  - Credential Access (Mimikatz)

---

## Contributions Welcome
- MITRE ATT&CK Matrix is open for contributions.

---

## MITRE Cyber Analytics Repository (CARET)
- Mapping analytics to the Tactics and Techniques (T&T) Matrix.
- Example:
  - **CAR:** Execution of suspicious commands
  - **T&T:** Discovery / many
  - **CAR:** Remote execution via WMI
  - **T&T:** Execution / WMI

## Brief Recap of BotConf 2016 Talk
- Using Sysmon to search and alert for known malicious process behaviors:
  - Image names / paths (e.g., svchost.exe, %APPDATA%\Oracle\bin\javaw.exe)
  - Command line parameters (e.g., /stext, vssadmin delete shadows, rundll32 qwerty)
  - Parent/Child process relationships (e.g., winword.exe -> explorer.exe, wscript.exe -> rundll32.exe)
  - Process injection (e.g., # winlogon.exe)

---

## Advanced Detection Examples
- **Adwind RAT:**
  - Alert for Java malware infection.
  - Query example: `index=sysmon SourceName="Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon" EventCode="1" (Users AppData Roaming (javaw.exe OR xcopy.exe)) OR (cmd cscript vbs)`

- **Detecting Keyloggers:**
  - Common keyloggers abusing NirSoft tools.
  - Query example: `index=sysmon SourceName="Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon" EventCode="1" ( stext OR scomma )`

- **BONUS: Detecting a new Banking Trojan variant (Heodo/Emotet):**
  - Link in email to download JS from web server.
  - Executing JS downloads EXE from web server.
  - EXE uses `/scomma` parameter (YARA: NirSoft strings in memory).

- **Malicious PowerShell:**
  - De-obfuscate simple obfuscation techniques.
  - Query example: `index=sysmon SourceName="Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon" EventCode="1" (powershell.exe OR cmd.exe) | eval CommandLine2=replace(CommandLine,"[ '+\"\^]","") | search (Image="*\\powershell.exe" OR Image="*\\cmd.exe") CommandLine2="*WebClient*" CommandLine2="*DownloadFile*"`

- **SMB Traffic Between Workstations:**
  - Query example: `index=sysmon SourceName="Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon" EventCode=3 Initiated=true SourceIp!=DestinationIp DestinationPort=445 Image!=System (SourceHostname="WS*" DestinationHostname="WS*") OR (SourceIp="10.10.*.*" DestinationIp="10.10.*.*") | stats by ComputerName ProcessGuid | fields ComputerName ProcessGuid`

- **Lateral Movement (Admin Shares):**
  - Query example: `LogName=Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational SourceName=Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon EventCode=1 EventType=4 ... Message=Process Create: Image: \\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\8c0cb58.exe ...`
