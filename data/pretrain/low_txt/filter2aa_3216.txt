## Internet of Things: August Smart Lock

### Marketing Claims by August
- "Unlike physical keys, which can be duplicated and distributed without your knowledge." (Source: august.com, August 17th, 2015)
- "Safer than codes that can be copied." (Source: august.com, September 14th, 2015)

### Security Claims
- **Perfectly Secure**
- **Guest Access Revocation**: Guest access can be revoked at any time.
- **Scheduled Permissions**: Guest permissions can be limited to a specific schedule.
- **Guest Restrictions**:
  - Cannot use auto-unlock
  - Cannot invite or remove guests or owners
  - Cannot view activity feed
  - Cannot view the guest list
  - Cannot change lock settings
- **Key Management**: Keys cannot be duplicated or distributed.
- **Activity Tracking**: Track who enters and exits your home.

## Mapping Out the API
- **WiFi | HTTPS**
- **BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)**
- **MitM Proxy**: Man-in-the-Middle proxy
- **Certificate Pinning**: Ensures secure communication

### Solution: iOS Kill Switch 2
- **Tool**: [iOS Kill Switch 2](https://github.com/nabla-c0d3/ssl-kill-switch2)
- **Issue**: Disabling SSL/TLS system-wide at Defcon
- **Better Solution**: No jailbreak required, even with certificate pinning in place

### Security Claims Revisited
- **Perfectly Secure**
- **Guest Access Revocation**: Guest access can be revoked at any time.
- **Scheduled Permissions**: Guest permissions can be limited to a specific schedule.
- **Guest Restrictions**:
  - Cannot use auto-unlock
  - Cannot invite or remove guests or owners
  - Cannot view activity feed
  - Cannot view the guest list
  - Cannot change lock settings
- **Key Management**: Keys cannot be duplicated or distributed.
- **Activity Tracking**: Track who enters and exits your home.

### Postman Collection
- A Postman collection was created (see GitHub repository).
- **Note**: Not anonymized, which is concerning.

### Mitigation
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack**: Can modify traffic.
- **Fix**: Do not forward log data to August and inform the app that logs were received.

### Additional Considerations
- **Guest to Admin?**: Guests should not be able to escalate privileges.
- **Auto-Unlock**: Guests cannot use auto-unlock.
- **Lock Settings**: Guests cannot control lock settings.
- **User Role**: Replace "user" with "superuser" to differentiate between roles.
- **Security Flaw**: Guests can change lock settings!

### BLE API
- **WiFi | HTTPS**
- **BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)**
- **Service Enumeration**: Enumerate BLE services.
- **Interception**: Intercepting BLE traffic.
- **Solution**: Ubertooth
- **Better Solution**: Tap and replace plaintext BLE traffic in log files.
- **No Jailbreak**: Required for this method.

### How August's Authentication Works
- **Requesting Firmware as a Guest**: This is unusual.
- **Marketing Claim**: "Safer than â€¦ codes that can be copied."
- **Repeating Hash**: 70F4F853E330BAEC27BF2724F39D1471 (repeated multiple times)

### Key Material in Logs
- **Security Claims**:
  - Perfectly secure
  - Guest access revocation
  - Scheduled permissions
  - Guest restrictions
  - Key management
  - Activity tracking

### Best Practices
- **Caution**: Do not give guest access to someone you would not give a key to.

### Demo

### Mistakes Made
- **Mobile App Logs**: Include sensitive information.
- **Role Differentiation**: Lock does not differentiate between guest and owner.
- **Unsigned Firmware**: Firmware is not signed.
- **Backdoor Discovery**: No apparent way for average users to discover backdoor keys.
- **Key Material Download**: Guest users can download key material.
- **Self-Reporting**: System relies on guests self-reporting unlock/lock events.
- **Two-Factor vs. Two-Step**: Vendor claims two-factor authentication when it is actually two-step.
- **Password Reset**: No rate limiting of password reset attempts (fixed).
- **Certificate Pinning Bypass**: Mobile app includes a bypass for certificate pinning.
- **Secure Randomness**: Not used for nonce or session key generation (fixed).
- **Keychain Storage**: Key material not stored on iOS keychain.

### What Was Done Correctly
- **Responsive Vendor**: August has been very responsive.
- **Certificate Pinning**: Mobile apps attempt to use certificate pinning.
- **Nonce Usage**: Protocol makes use of nonces in CBC mode.
- **Security Model**: Not solely reliant on BLE's "just works" security model.

### Hackers Needed
- **Consumer Awareness**: Consumers are not able to evaluate security claims made by companies.
- **Researcher Involvement**: We need more researchers investigating security claims made by companies on behalf of consumers.
- **Proof and Assertion**: What can be asserted without proof can be dismissed without proof.
