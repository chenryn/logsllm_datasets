## 1. Motivation and Objectives
Nanocomputing technologies hold the promise of lower power consumption, higher performance, and increased functionality. However, the dependability of these small-scale devices remains uncertain. The main sources of concern are:

- **Sensitivity to Process Variations**: Nanometer devices are highly sensitive to process variations. Current guard-bands used to mitigate these variations may not be feasible in the future, leading to more frequent timing errors.
- **New Failure Modes**: New materials introduce specific failure modes that pose significant challenges for design and test engineers.
- **Environment-Induced Errors**: Single event upsets (SEUs) and other environmental errors are likely to occur more frequently in nanoscale devices compared to conventional semiconductor devices.
- **Hardware Redundancy Techniques**: New hardware redundancy techniques are needed to enable the development of energy-efficient systems.
- **Increased Complexity**: The complexity of nanotechnology-based systems will require improved computer-aided design (CAD) tools and better validation techniques.
- **Security Threats**: Security of nanocomputing systems may be threatened by malicious attacks targeting new vulnerable areas in the hardware.

In the coming years, suitable hardware features and fault-tolerant architectures will be widely employed to address these issues. This need and trend were explicitly highlighted in the 2008 update of the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS). As a result, the use of error-correcting codes, space and time redundancy, and improved error reporting and system manageability will increase. Software solutions will play a leading role in improving design and validation tools, and new parallel processing programming paradigms will be needed due to the advent of multi-core processors.

## 2. Scope and Topics
This year's workshop focuses on Architecting, Designing, Manufacturing, and Assessing Dependable Nanocomputing Systems, with special attention to the following topical areas:

- **Nanocomputing Architectures for High Dependability**
- **Design and Validation Techniques for Coping with Increased Complexity**
- **Manufacturing Techniques and Yield Improvement in Nanoscale Devices**
- **On-line Adaptive Nanocomputing Architectures for High Dependability**
- **Verification, Testing, and Diagnosis Methods**
- **Failure Mode Assessment and Risk Analysis**
- **Design and Validation Tools for Coping with Increased Complexity**
- **Mitigation of Impairments Related to Power Dissipation and Reduced Energy Consumption**
- **Malicious Threats and Security Issues**

Contributions related to these topics will continue the debate on the issues posed by nanocomputing and the best solutions for providing high dependability to end users.

## 3. Format of the Workshop
The feedback from the global community was very positive, with ten papers submitted from seven different countries: Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the USA. Eight regular contributions and a special focus session have been accepted by the Program Committee members and the organizers.

The program spans a full day divided into four sessions:

- **Session 1**: A brief introduction followed by a special focus session on testing challenges in nanoelectronics.
- **Session 2**: Three presentations on Soft Errors and Intermittent Faults.
- **Session 3**: Proposals for Fault-Tolerant Architectures.
- **Session 4**: Two presentations on Robustness Enhancement and Trust Management, concluding with a general discussion and a wrap-up.

We look forward to the same success and lively discussions as in previous editions, which included over forty attendees from academia and industry, representing 18 countries.

## 4. Acknowledgement and Invitation
The organizers would like to thank the Program Committee members for their dedication and insightful feedback to the authors. We sincerely hope you will enjoy the workshop and actively participate. Your comments and suggestions are welcome.

All workshop contributions will be available via IEEE Xplore. We would like to thank the DSN-10 conference organizers, especially the Conference and Workshop Chairs, for their support and positive feedback. Special thanks go to the Publication Chair for making possible a wider exposure for the workshop papers.
