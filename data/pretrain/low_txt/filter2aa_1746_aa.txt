### Slide 5
**The Fascinating Competition by Tim Hwang and the Web Ecology Project (2011)**
- **Overview:**
  - Follow all 500 target users instantly.
  - Tweet from a random list of messages every 2-3 hours.
  - Continuously post "cute cat" pictures from Flickr to a blog, which auto-tweets to the user's timeline.
  - Use secondary bots to follow the network of the 500 users and their followers to test for follow-backs.

### Slide 6
**"Blood Sport for Internet Social Science/Network Analysis Nerds"**
- Tim Hwang and the Web Ecology team described the competition as a "blood sport" for internet social science and network analysis enthusiasts.

### Slide 7
**Target Selection: 500 Cat Lovers**
- The 500 targets were selected based on their interest in cats (the animals, not the musical).

### Slide 8
**Scoring System**
- **Points:**
  - +1 for a mutual follow
  - +3 for a social response
  - -15 if suspended by Twitter

**Competition:**
- Three teams participated, targeting the same 500 unsuspecting users.

### Slide 9
**Winning Team: @AeroFade**
- **Achievements:**
  - 701 points
  - 107 mutual follows
  - 198 social responses
- Check out @AeroFade’s Twitter and blog for more details.

### Slide 10
**Research Focus: Detecting Susceptible Users**
- Most research focuses on identifying bots, but less on detecting users likely to be fooled by them.
- This is crucial for raising awareness and finding solutions.

### Slide 11
**Side Project: Social Bots in the 2012 Study**
- During our 2012 study on Twitter usage and the Dark Triad of personality, we incorporated a side project to examine social bots and answer key questions.

### Slide 12
**Research Question 1: Predisposition to Interact with Strangers**
- Are some users more naturally predisposed to interact with strangers (social bots) than others?
- Does personality play a role?

### Slide 13
**Research Question 2: Increasing Response Odds**
- Is it possible to use machine learning to better target users who are more likely to respond, thereby reducing the chances of account suspension?

### Slide 14
**Reducing Chances of Twitter Suspension**
- The goal is to reduce the likelihood of landing in "Twitter Jail" (account suspension) by targeting more responsive users.

### Slide 15
**Relevance and Concerns**
- **Questions:**
  - Who cares about this research?
  - Aren't you giving bad actors ideas?
  - What does this have to do with privacy?
- We will address these concerns in greater depth.

### Slide 16
**"If It Can Be Measured, It Can Be Manipulated"**
- Unscrupulous actors, such as some marketers, are attracted to areas that can be measured and manipulated.
- Initially, they sought 'likes,' but now they aim for 'engagement.'

### Slide 17
**Propagandists and Their Interest**
- Propagandists also find value in these techniques.

### Slide 18
**Privacy Implications**
- The privacy implications are well-described in a recent paper by Erhardt Graeff.

### Slide 19
**Improving Bot Detection**
- Existing social media sites are getting better at detecting bots, so part of an effective bot strategy is to reduce the chances of being suspended.

### Slide 20
**Experiment Execution**
- Our bots were set to work to conduct the experiment.

### Slide 21
**Contents/Flow of the Talk**
- History & Current Research
- Experiment & Method
- Findings
- Conclusions

### Slide 22
**Socialbots: Definition and M.O.**
- **Definition:**
  - A socialbot is a piece of software that controls a user account in an online social network and passes itself off as a human (Wagner et al., 2012).
- **M.O.:**
  - Make friends

  - Influence
- **Success Factors:**
  - Target users interested in the spam topic
  - Rely on those users to spread the spam further

### Slide 23
**Evolution of Bots**
- **Chatterbots (1994):** Early research on chatbots.
- **Social Media Bots:**
  - 1st Generation: Basic and focused on popularity.
  - 2nd Generation: More sophisticated and context-aware.

### Slide 24
