### Preparedness and Risk Levels

| Prepared State | Partially Prepared | Unprepared State | Significant Risk of Reduced Financial Performance |
|----------------|--------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| (~2 weeks)     | (~8 weeks)         | (16+ weeks)      |                                                   |

### Key Considerations
- **Never Plan to "Just Pay the Ransom"**
- **Reducing Time to Recover = Reducing Lost Revenue (and Distractions from Business Growth)**

### What ‘Unprepared’ Looks Like: A True Story
#### Desperate Measures
- **Business Down**: Most operations are completely down.
- **Zero or Limited Visibility into Operations**.
- **Zero or Limited Ability to Execute Processes**.
- **Pervasive Uncertainty**: Even if paying the ransom(s).
- **Unknown/uncertain timeline to restore business operations and return to profitability**.
- **Uncertain if keys/tools from criminals will work**.
- **Uncertain legal/brand ramifications of paying criminals (who may be affiliated with terrorists)**.
- **High likelihood gangs will sell data even after paying ransom**.
- **In destructive scenarios, there is no key, and IT must be completely rebuilt from the ground up**.
- **Unreliable communication with employees & customers (status updates, managing expectations, coordination)**.
- **Chaotic communications + leaks to social media. Slow Recovery – manual restoration of each critical system**.
- **Using backups, sh---y ransomware tools, or old disks**.
- **Teams work endless hours, get exhausted, make mistakes (recover wrong systems, forget basic steps, etc.), get emotional, start burning out and quitting**.
- **Risk of no recovery (destructive attacks, etc.)**.

### Legal and Brand Risks
- **Funding Criminals/Terrorists**.
- **Funding Future Attacks on You**.
- **Restore trust in environment**.
- **‘Planning to Pay’ has hidden costs and doesn’t avoid security investments**.

### Secure Cloud Adoption
- **Enables rapid secure innovation**.
- **Secure cloud adoption is the foundation of a Trusted Digital Fabric**.
- **Components of a Trusted Digital Fabric**:
  - **Safely Enable Business Agility from anywhere**.
  - **Secure hybrid work**.
  - **Modern security incident response**.
  - **Trusted Digital Fabric**:
    - **Business Agility**.
    - **Great User Experience**.
    - **Secure Cloud Migration**.
    - **Find and protect critical data**.
    - **Business Enablement**.
    - **How much security friction is in user experience and business processes?**.
    - **Security Posture: How good are we at preventing damage?**.

### Starting Points for Security Improvement
- **Are we getting better every month?**
- **How good are we at responding to and recovering from attacks?**
- **Board Questions and Metrics**:
  - **Focus on continuous improvement**.

### Scorecard Metrics
| Security | Business Enablement | Security Posture | Security Response | Security Improvement |
|----------|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Mean Time for security review | % of new apps/etc. reviewed | Mean Time to Recover (MTTR) | # of modernization projects open | # of modernization project milestones achieved in last 60 days |
| Average boot/logon time for managed devices | % Compliant apps | Time to Restore Critical Systems | Number of repetitive manual steps removed from workflows | # of Lessons learned from internal/external incidents |

### Key Business Outcomes
- **What is our financial exposure to security risk?**
- **How prepared are we for extortion/ransomware attack?**
- **Are processes aligned to identifying and protecting business-critical processes?**
- **Are we securing all business-critical assets? (including IT, IoT, and OT)**
- **Can we recover them quickly?**
- **Are we measuring continuous improvement for security?**
- **Is the security program balanced across people, process, and tech?**
- **Are the security risk decisions made by the right people? Are they prepared and informed to do so?**

### Business Models and Partnerships
- **Technology Trends**.
- **Regulatory, Geopolitical, Cultural Forces**.
- **Disruptive Events**.
- **Paradigm Shift to Remote Work: Employee → Supplier → Partners**.
- **Better security and user experience with Passwordless + working anywhere you want**.

### NIST 800-40 on Security Maintenance
1. **Prioritize secure cloud adoption + modernization investments**:
   - **Accelerate secure cloud & app modernization increases productivity and reduces risk**.
   - **Normalize preventive maintenance for security reduces downtime & disruption risk**.
2. **Help protect business-critical assets and processes**:
   - **Identify business-critical systems**.
   - **Sponsor + participate in Cybersecurity BC/DR exercises**.
3. **Shift security accountability and oversight to business owners**:
   - **Prepare business owners for security risk**.
   - **Empower business owners to accept security risk**.
   - **Encourage continuous collaboration between business, IT, and security teams**.

### CISO Workshop
- **Align Security Priorities to Business**.
- **Integrate Security Risk into Existing Processes**.
- **Threat Awareness and Planning**.
- **Increase security literacy for organizational leaders**.
- **Prioritize security investments around your likely threats**.

### Next Up
- **1B Risk Insights, Security Integration, Business Resilience**.

### Security Management – Key Operational Functions
- **Two operational functions for prevention (potential risk) and response (realized risk)**.
- **Posture Management: Manage potential security risk (vulnerabilities)**.
- **Collaboration**.
- **Security Operations / SOC: Manage realized security risk (attacks)**.

### Continuously Learning to Reduce Risk
- **Collaborative approach to mitigate potential and realized risk**.
- **Evolution of Posture Management**.
- **New Tooling Available: On-demand insights into security posture, threat intelligence helps prioritize**.

### Security Posture Management
- **Measure and Report Risk across all sources**.
- **Mitigate Risk by enabling teams**.

### Traditional Vulnerability Management
- **Focused on Operating System vulnerabilities**.

### Posture Management
- **Large and complex: Collaboratively enabling many teams to secure a continuously changing technical estate**.

### Rapid Modernization Plan (RaMP)
1. **Start with Cloud Infrastructure (via CSPM)**:
   - **Tooling: Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) for VMs, Containers, Databases, etc.**.
   - **Process: Build shared responsibility model between teams + enablement processes for IT/DevOps teams**.
   - **Configuration Baseline: Start with vendor/industry recommendations**.
2. **Extend CSPM to all clouds and on-premises data centers**.
