# Bandwidth and Latency Correlation Analysis

## Introduction
The primary objective of this analysis is to investigate the relationship between bandwidth and latency in network paths. If a strong correlation exists, it can facilitate scalable estimation of network bandwidth without extensive probing, which is resource-intensive. It is important to note that using capacity rather than available bandwidth is more suitable for this analysis, as the latter varies over time and may not align with latency measurements.

## Data Collection and Metrics
### Latency Measurement
Initially, we used all-pair ping data for latency measurement. However, due to missing data, there was limited overlap between the ping data and the collected bandwidth measurements. Therefore, we also utilized Round-Trip Time (RTT) measurements from the `pathrate` tool. The trends from both methods were similar, so we present results based on the RTT latency from `pathrate`.

### Bandwidth and Latency Correlation
We employed two metrics to study the correlation between bandwidth and latency:

1. **Relative Bandwidth Correlation Metric**: This metric captures the ratio of the maximum bandwidth path to the bandwidth of the closest node. For a given host (nodei), we identify the host with the minimum latency (nodeminLat) and the host providing the maximum bandwidth (nodemaxBW). The relative bandwidth correlation penalty for nodei is defined as the ratio of the maximum bandwidth (BWi,maxBW) to the bandwidth from nodei to nodeminLat (BWi,minLat). This metric has values greater than or equal to 1.0, with values closer to 1.0 indicating a stronger correlation between latency and bandwidth.

2. **Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient**: This non-parametric measure is used when the data sets come from different distributions. We ranked all node pairs based on both bandwidth and latency and plotted the bandwidth rank against the latency rank. A strong correlation would result in points clustered along the y = x line. 

## Results
### Relative Bandwidth Correlation
Figures 4 and 5 show the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the relative bandwidth correlation metric for two data sets. In Set 1, about 40% of the nodes have a bandwidth to the closest node that is roughly 40% smaller than the maximum bandwidth. In Set 2, approximately 90% of the closest nodes have capacities nearly equal to the maximum bandwidth. This suggests a stronger correlation in Set 2.

### Spearman Rank Correlation
Figure 6 illustrates the bandwidth and latency ranks. The Spearman coefficients for Sets 1 and 2 are 0.027 and 0.138, respectively. The low values indicate a weak overall rank-order correlation, which may be due to the inclusion of all possible nodes. We hypothesize that the degree of rank-order correlation is higher for nearby nodes and decreases with distance.

## Summary and Conclusions
This study presents a large-scale analysis of end-to-end capacity between PlanetLab nodes. Key findings include:

- Network paths connecting PlanetLab nodes are highly heterogeneous in terms of capacity.
- Capacity values can differ by an order of magnitude even for paths sourced from the same node.
- Paths do not necessarily exhibit capacity symmetry.
- There are violations of the PlanetLab policy regarding bandwidth limits, which may be due to tool inaccuracies.

Our preliminary results suggest a promising correlation between latency and bandwidth, particularly in certain subsets of nodes. Future work includes modifying the SProbe tool for more reliable measurements and periodically measuring all-pair bandwidth between PlanetLab hosts to make the data publicly available.
