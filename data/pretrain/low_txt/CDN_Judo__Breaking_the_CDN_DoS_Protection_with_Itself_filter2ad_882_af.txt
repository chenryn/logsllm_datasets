### Cache Deception Attacks

Unlike previous research, our work investigates threats in CDN forwarding behaviors that have not been extensively studied, thereby complementing existing CDN security research.

### HTTP-Related DoS Attacks

HTTP DoS attacks can be launched by initiating a large number of legitimate HTTP requests [36]. Additionally, configurations and functions related to the HTTP service can introduce new DoS attack vectors [39]. As an application-layer attack, HTTP DoS is challenging to detect because the attacking requests resemble normal end-user requests [27, 54, 62]. In this paper, we highlight issues in the request-forwarding process of CDNs. While CDNs are typically considered effective anti-DDoS solutions for websites, our study shows that CDNs themselves can be exploited to launch such attacks, thus undermining their DoS protection capabilities.

In the HTTP/1.1 era, slow HTTP attacks were well-known [29, 48, 56]. However, the advent of HTTP/2 has introduced new attack vectors. Beckett et al. reported that HTTP/2 can significantly increase the magnitude of HTTP flood DDoS attacks [6, 7]. We extend their study to CDNs and analyze the impact of the HPACK mechanism, including Huffman encoding and the :path header field, on the amplification ratio.

Historically, botnets have been used to launch DDoS attacks [1, 43, 51]. With the rise of IoT devices, the cost of these attacks has decreased, while the generated traffic has increased [2, 38]. Although IP blocking can mitigate attacks from botnets, the HTTP DoS attacks described in this paper originate from the CDN itself, making them more stealthy and difficult to detect. Moreover, a CDN-powered website cannot apply IP blocking to mitigate these attacks, as blocking CDN IPs would render the website inaccessible to all clients.

### Issues with IP Assignment Strategy

The IP assignment strategy, which determines how a network service assigns IP addresses, is vulnerable to DHCP starvation attacks [44]. Borgolte et al. identified the IP use-after-free vulnerability in the cloud, which can be exploited to deceive domain-based certificate issuance [9]. In the context of CDNs, the egress IP assignment, which involves how a CDN assigns an egress IP to forward requests to the origin, was also studied by Jin et al. [34], and they observed similar results to ours.

### Conclusions

CDNs have become an indispensable part of the Internet, providing various benefits, including anti-DoS services for CDN-powered websites. However, by exploiting architectural, implementation, or operational weaknesses, CDNs can also be leveraged to break their own DoS protection.

By revealing three relevant threats and presenting real-world measurements across six CDNs, this paper highlights the flawed trade-offs made by CDN vendors between security and usability. We report that, due to protocol or implementation weaknesses, full-featured HTTP forwarding support in CDNs can be abused to launch efficient DoS attacks against website origins. We hope our work will encourage CDNs to raise their security standards and inspire further research into CDN-related security.
