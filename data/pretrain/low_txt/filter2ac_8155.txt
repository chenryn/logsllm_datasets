### Title: Blackhat: EU-22 - Abusing CNC Technologies

CNC machines are widely used in production plants and are a critical asset for organizations globally. The push towards Industry 4.0 has led to the introduction of technologies that enable the broad connectivity of industrial equipment, including CNC machines. As a result, modern CNCs now resemble fully-fledged systems rather than simple mechanical machines, offering a wide range of networking services for smart connectivity. This shift to a more complex and software-dependent ecosystem has left these machines more vulnerable to potential threats.

Our research focused on the risks associated with the technological advancements in the field of numerical controls. We conducted an empirical evaluation of four representative controller manufacturers, analyzing the technologies introduced to meet the demands of Industry 4.0. We also performed a series of practical attacks on real-world CNC installations. Our findings revealed that malicious users could exploit these technologies to carry out various attacks, including denial-of-service, damage, hijacking, or theft.

We reported our findings to the affected vendors and proposed mitigations. This presentation aims to raise awareness in a domain where, unfortunately, security is not yet considered a top priority.
