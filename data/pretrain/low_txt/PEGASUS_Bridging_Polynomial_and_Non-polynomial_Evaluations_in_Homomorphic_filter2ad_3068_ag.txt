### Appendix A: Operations of the RNS Variant of the CKKS Scheme

We provide the details of the CKKS operations used in PEGASUS, which involve primes \( q_0, q_1, \ldots, q_{L-1} \). Let \( Q_i = \prod_{k=0}^{i} q_k \) for all \( i \in [L] \).

- **Setup**: The dimension \( n \) is a power of 2. There are \( L > 0 \) distinct primes. The error distribution \( \chi_{\text{err}} \) is defined as the centered discrete normal distribution with standard deviation \( \sigma_{\text{CKKS}} > 0 \). The encryption distribution \( \chi_{\text{enc}} \) is defined as the uniform distribution over \( \{0, \pm 1\}^n \).

- **KeyGen**: Sample the secret key \( s \) from \( \{0, \pm 1\}^n \). Set the public key \( pk \in \text{RLWE}_{n, Q_{L-1}}(0) \), i.e., a RLWE sample of zero.

- **Encryption**: On a plaintext \( \hat{m} \in R_{n, Q_{L-1}} \), compute \( ct = (\hat{m} + \hat{e}, 0) + \hat{u} \cdot pk \in \text{RLWE}_{n, Q_{L-1}}(\hat{m}) \), where the coefficients of \( \hat{e} \in R_{n, Q_{L-1}} \) are sampled from \( \chi_{\text{err}} \) and \( \hat{u} \in R_{n, Q_{L-1}} \) are sampled from \( \chi_{\text{enc}} \).

- **Extended Encryption**: On a plaintext \( \hat{m} \in R_{n, Q_{L-1}} \) and a gadget \( g \in \mathbb{Z}^d \), compute a set of RLWE samples \( (c_0, \ldots, c_{d-1}) \in \text{RLWE}_{n, Q_{L-1}}(\hat{m}; g) \) where \( c_i \in \text{RLWE}_{n, Q_{L-1}}(g[i] \cdot \hat{m}) \) for \( i \in [d] \).

- **Decryption**: On the ciphertext \( ct = (c_0, c_1) \in R_{2, n, Q_l} \) for any \( l \in [L] \), compute and output \( c_0 + c_1 \cdot s \in R_{n, Q_l} \).

- **Addition**: On the ciphertexts \( (c_0, c_1) \in \text{RLWE}_{n, Q_l}(\hat{m}) \) and \( (c'_0, c'_1) \in \text{RLWE}_{n, Q_l}(\hat{m}') \) for any \( l \in [L] \), compute \( (c_0 + c'_0, c_1 + c'_1) \in \text{RLWE}_{n, Q_l}(\hat{m} + \hat{m}') \).

- **Multiplication**: On the ciphertexts \( (c_0, c_1) \in \text{RLWE}_{n, Q_l}(\hat{m}) \) and \( (c'_0, c'_1) \in \text{RLWE}_{n, Q_l}(\hat{m}') \) and a relinearization key \( \text{RelK} \in \text{RLWE}_{n, Q_l}(s^2; g) \), for any \( l \in [L] \), first compute \( \tilde{c}_0 = c_0 \cdot c'_0 \), \( \tilde{c}_1 = c_0 \cdot c'_1 + c_1 \cdot c'_0 \), and \( \tilde{c}_2 = c_1 \cdot c'_1 \). Then output \( (\tilde{c}_0, \tilde{c}_1) + \tilde{c}_2 \circ \text{RelK} \in \text{RLWE}_{n, Q_l}(\hat{m} \cdot \hat{m}') \).

- **Rotation**: On the ciphertext \( (c_0, c_1) \in \text{RLWE}_{n, Q_l}(\hat{m}) \) and a rotation key \( \text{RotK}_k \in \text{RLWE}_{n, Q_l}(\phi_k(s); g) \) for any \( l \in [L] \), compute \( (\phi_k(c_0), 0) + c_1 \circ \text{RotK}_k \in \text{RLWE}_{n, Q_l}(\hat{m} \ll k) \).
