#### B. Advice Comprehensibility
- Figures 7 and 9 summarize the comprehensibility of the corpus.
- Figure 10 summarizes the mean Cloze scores across specific advice providers who are members of the U.S. Government, non-tech non-profits, and technical non-profits.

#### C. User Perceived Actionability Questionnaire
- The questions for this section of the survey are about the following advice: "You should create a new email address if your last one is compromised. An example of this advice might be: 'Time for a new email address. This is the last resort but it will be 100% effective at giving you a clean slate.'"

#### D. Pairwise Comparisons of Actionability and Priority By Topic
- **Antivirus, Browsers, Data Storage, Device Security, Finance, General Security, Incident Response, Network Security, Passwords, Privacy, Software, Account Security**
