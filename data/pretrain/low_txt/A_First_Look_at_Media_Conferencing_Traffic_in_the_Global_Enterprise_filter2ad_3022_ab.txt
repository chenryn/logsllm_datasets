### Call Traffic Analysis in a Typical Media Aggregator

**Figure 3. Call Traffic at a Typical Media Aggregator**

The call traffic pattern over a typical week and day is illustrated in Figure 3, showing the distribution of calls across different times. The y-axis represents the number of calls, and the x-axis shows the time of day in Pacific Standard Time (PST).

- **(a) Typical Week**: This graph shows the call volume throughout the week, with peaks and troughs indicating busy and quiet periods.
- **(b) Typical Day**: This graph provides a more granular view, showing the call volume on an hourly basis.

### Factors Affecting Call Quality

Call quality can be impacted by both network-specific and application-specific factors. Network-specific factors include packet loss, jitter, and delay, while application-specific factors include audio echo, codec bitrate, and frame loss rates. Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) are useful for differentiating between poor and acceptable call quality. However, maximum packet loss is a significant contributor to poor call quality from a network perspective.

- **Packet Loss Calculation**: Packet loss is calculated over 30-second intervals during the call, with the highest packet loss interval recorded at the end of the call.
- **Impact of High Packet Loss**: Even a single moment of high packet loss can significantly degrade the caller's experience, making it a critical metric for assessing call quality.

### Wireless Last-Hop Analysis

While many enterprise networks use wired LANs, a significant number of hosts in large enterprises also use wireless LANs. Research has shown that VoIP call quality over 802.11-based wireless access is often poor, even with sufficient bandwidth.

- **Figure 4(a)**: The CDF of maximum packet loss for streams with wireless endpoints shows that wireless connections experience higher packet loss rates compared to wired connections. For example, 5-10% of streams experience packet loss rates above 4%, leading to poor audio quality.
- **Figure 4(b)**: Audio streams with at least one wireless endpoint experience longer burst durations of packet loss, which can render the packets useless for real-time applications.

### Home Users and VPN Clients

Comparing intra-enterprise calls to those that transit part of the public Internet reveals that packet loss rates are higher for home and VPN users. 

- **Figure 5**: The CDF of packet loss for different types of users shows that 5% of streams for home and VPN users experience packet loss rates greater than 10%. This suggests that the enterprise network is better provisioned than the public Internet, but may not be as underutilized as previously thought.

### QoS and Voice VLAN Usage

Most IP phone deployments use a separate voice VLAN, with packets marked with prioritized DSCP bits. Core routers and inter-branch office interfaces prioritize this traffic.

- **Figure 6(a)**: The CDF of maximum packet loss fraction based on QoS support shows that when both endpoints are on the voice VLAN, nearly all calls experience less than 2% packet loss. When only one endpoint is on the voice VLAN, packet loss increases, but most calls still do not exceed 4%.
- **Figure 6(b)**: Packet loss characteristics are further broken down based on whether the call traverses an inter-branch link or remains within the same branch. Intra-branch paths have lower packet loss rates, suggesting that inter-branch paths are more likely to be bottlenecked.

### Related Work

Recent studies have focused on various aspects of enterprise networks, including OSPF behavior, traffic analysis, network management, troubleshooting, and wireless diagnosis. Our paper provides a first look into VoIP and conferencing traffic in a global, heterogeneous enterprise network.

### Conclusion

This study is the first to measure and analyze media traffic in a global enterprise. Using session-level reports, we quantify the impact of various factors on call quality, including wired vs. wireless access, inter- vs. intra-branch communication, QoS mechanisms, and VPN vs. public Internet access. Our findings suggest that careful network planning and provisioning, along with the use of QoS mechanisms, are essential for supporting good quality media applications in the modern enterprise.
