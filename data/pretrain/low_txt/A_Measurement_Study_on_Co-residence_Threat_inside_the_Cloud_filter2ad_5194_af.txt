# Analysis of EC2 US East Region

## A. Business Scale of EC2

### Overview
Figure 19 illustrates the number of detected live instances in the EC2 US East region during the measurement period. The business scale in this region is impressive, with our scanning consistently detecting over 650,000 live instances. During peak times, nearly 700,000 live instances were detected.

### Key Points
- **Peak and Valley Times**: The peak time is around 5 p.m. (EST), while the valley is around 4 a.m. (EST). The difference in the number of live instances between these times is only about 1,000, which is relatively small given the overall 650,000 live instances.
- **Global Distribution**: Despite the diurnal pattern, the small difference can be attributed to stable services (e.g., web and database services) that remain active all the time and the global distribution of customers. For example, the Virginia data center handles more than 85% of EC2 traffic in Italy, where 4 a.m. EST is 10 a.m. local time, a period of high activity.

### Service Breakdown
Table 4 provides a breakdown of the number of instances hosting specific services:
- **Web Services**: Dominates usage, with over half deploying HTTPS.
- **SSH**: Second most common service, as it is the default access method for EC2 instances.
- **Other Services**: FTP, DNS, and database services (MySQL + SQL) are also significant, but less so compared to web and SSH services.

## B. Dynamic Environment of EC2

### Live Instance Variations
- **Diurnal Pattern**: The number of live instances varies over time within a day, peaking around 5 p.m. (EST) and reaching a low around 4 a.m. (EST).
- **Stable Services**: Most instances run stable services like web and databases, contributing to the small difference between peak and valley times.
- **Global Usage**: The data center serves a global customer base, leading to consistent activity even during off-peak hours in the US.

### Instance Dynamics
- **Instance Changes**: Figure 20 shows that over 15,000 hosts change every 20 minutes, indicating a highly dynamic environment with frequent VM booting and shutdowns.
- **IP Mappings**: Over 15 days, 103,242 mappings between public and private IP addresses changed, suggesting the use of dynamic NAT for address translation.
- **Private IP Address Pool**: Figure 21 highlights the dynamic nature of the IP address pool, with certain ranges having higher densities, particularly for micro and small instances, which are frequently turned on and off.

## C. VM Placement Locality in EC2

### Type Locality
- **Internal IP Distribution**: Figure 22 shows that instances of the same type tend to have closer internal IPs, indicating some physical proximity. However, this type locality has weakened compared to 2008 [14].

### Availability Zone Locality
- **Zone Impact**: Figure 23 illustrates that instances in the same availability zone are more likely to have their internal IP addresses within a certain range, but this locality is also weaker than in 2008 [14].
