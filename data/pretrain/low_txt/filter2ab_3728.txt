### Title: From Idea to Mass Production: A Hacker's Journey in Manufacturing Hardware Implants

**Abstract:**

This presentation aims to inspire and guide hackers who have always wanted to share their innovative hacking devices with the community but were unsure about navigating the complexities of Research and Development (R&D), Quality Assurance (QA), and mass production. I will walk you through the entire lifecycle of two hacking tools I developed: the WHID Injector and WHID Elite. 

From the initial concept to the final release, I will share my experiences, including the challenges and setbacks I encountered along the way. What makes this topic particularly interesting is that both R&D processes were entirely self-funded, and I do not profit from the sale of these devices. This project is purely a hobby and a way for me to give back to the InfoSec community.

By sharing my journey, I hope to motivate others to embark on similar not-for-profit projects. I will also highlight examples of other hackers who were inspired by my work and followed in my footsteps, creating their own community-driven initiatives.

Join me to learn how I brought these ideas to life and perhaps be inspired to start your own project!
