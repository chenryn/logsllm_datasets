An Israeli security firm has uncovered a major security vulnerability (CVE-2016-0728) within the Linux kernel, which has been present for nearly three years. This flaw impacts a substantial number of Linux servers and desktop computers, as well as approximately 70% of Android smartphones and tablets.

### Details of the Vulnerability

According to [an article](http://perception-point.io/2016/01/14/analysis-and-exploitation-of-a-linux-kernel-vulnerability-cve-2016-0728/) published by Perception Point, the vulnerability resides in the Linux keyring, which is used to store authentication information, encryption keys, and other sensitive data. In essence, this vulnerability allows an attacker to elevate the privileges of a regular local user to root, thereby gaining full control over the device. For a more detailed analysis, refer to [this article](http://perception-point.io/2016/01/14/analysis-and-exploitation-of-a-linux-kernel-vulnerability-cve-2016-0728/).

This is particularly concerning because a root-level attacker can perform any action on the device, including installing malware, deleting files, and accessing sensitive information. On vulnerable Android devices, obtaining root access is as simple as having a user click on a malicious link or scan a QR code, then download and open an untrusted application.

### Who Is Affected?

Perception Point has not observed any attacks exploiting this vulnerability yet, which provides some relief. However, a large number of devices are exposed to this risk, making them potential targets.

"Although we and the kernel security team have not seen any exploitation of this vulnerability, the exposure is there and could be utilized at any time," states Perception Point. "We recommend that security teams check affected devices and apply patches as soon as possible."

The vulnerability affects thousands of Linux desktops and servers running kernel versions 3.8 and above. Since Android incorporates parts of the Linux kernel, devices running Android 4.4 and later are also impacted. Approximately 69.4% of Android devices are estimated to be at risk, far exceeding initial expectations. If you have purchased or upgraded an Android device within the past two years, it is likely to be affected.

Google [responded](https://plus.google.com/+AdrianLudwig/posts/KxHcLPgSPoY) to Perception Point's findings and has released a security patch to its partners, stating that the number of affected devices is "significantly fewer than initially reported."

"We are confident that Nexus devices are not vulnerable to third-party applications due to this issue," wrote Adrian Ludwig of Google. "Additionally, Android 5.0 and later versions are protected by SELinux policies, which prevent third-party apps from accessing the problematic code. Furthermore, devices running Android 4.4 and earlier do not include the affected code, which was introduced in Linux kernel version 3.8 and cannot be applied to older Android devices."

### Severity of the Issue

This vulnerability, which has remained undetected for nearly three years, is highly serious, especially since Perception Point has provided proof-of-concept code.

On the positive side, Red Hat and Ubuntu have already released updates, allowing administrators to apply the necessary patches.

For Android, the situation is more complex. Although Google has initiated a monthly security update program, it has not specified whether this patch will be included in the February update. Even if it is, the process of rolling out the patch to devices from various Android manufacturers can be lengthy. In other words, it is uncertain when all affected Android devices will receive the update.

However, users can protect themselves by avoiding suspicious links, unknown QR codes, and untrusted applications. Once a security update is available, it should be installed promptly.
