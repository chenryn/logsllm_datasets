### Tracking and Analyzing Spamming Botnets: An Overview of BOTMAGNIFIER

#### Introduction
To combat spamming botnets, various approaches have been employed. One common method is to take down the Command and Control (C&C) server and perform an offline analysis to reconstruct information [21]. A less invasive approach involves reverse-engineering the communication protocol used by the botnet and then impersonating a bot [4, 6, 15, 32]. This allows for continuous collection of information about the botnet, such as gathering spam templates [6].

BOTMAGNIFIER complements these methods by tracking spamming botnets in a non-invasive manner from a novel vantage point. The data generated by our tool enables high-level studies of botnets, including tracking their size and evolution over time and obtaining a live view of hosts within a specific botnet.

#### Comparative Analysis
Ramachandran et al. [27] analyzed queries against a DNS-based Blackhole List (DNSBL) to reveal botnet memberships. Their approach is based on the assumption that bots may check if their IP addresses are blacklisted. While this can disclose information about infected machines, BOTMAGNIFIER analyzes intrinsic traces left by spamming machines, such as email server queries to DNSBLs. By clustering and enriching this data, we can identify spambots in a generic way. Additionally, our approach can be applied to other types of transaction logs.

Several studies have analyzed spam and its side effects [2, 12, 16, 42, 43]. BOTLAB [11], a tool that correlates incoming and outgoing spam, shares some similarities with our approach. However, while BOTLAB approximates the relative size of different spamming botnets and provides insights into current spam campaigns, BOTMAGNIFIER detects IP addresses of hosts belonging to spamming botnets at an Internet-wide level. We use the analysis environment only to collect information for labeling spam campaigns, while other techniques, such as DNSBL analysis, differ from BOTLAB.

Another system, AUTORE [40], examines content-level features in email bodies to group spam messages into campaigns. The authors performed a large-scale evaluation using mail messages from a major webmail provider to generate signatures for detecting polymorphic modifications in spam campaigns. Xie et al. also examined characteristics of spam campaigns, similar to our work. In contrast, our approach focuses on behavioral similarities between members of a spamming botnet without requiring knowledge of the actual spam content.

#### Spam Mitigation
Traditional spam detection methods focus either on the content of spam messages [3, 22, 40] or on network-level features [10, 25, 26, 28, 29, 38]. BOTMAGNIFIER generates lists of IP addresses associated with spamming botnets, which complements both approaches. Our analysis results can improve systems that use network-level features to detect spambots, for example, by proactively listing such IP addresses in blacklists. Furthermore, the information can be used to notify ISPs about infected customers within their networks.

#### Conclusion
We presented BOTMAGNIFIER, a tool for tracking and analyzing spamming botnets. The tool "magnifies" an initial seed pool of spamming IP addresses by learning the behavior of known spamming bots and matching these patterns against a partial log of email transactions on the Internet. We validated and evaluated our approach on several datasets, including ground truth data from a botnet's C&C hosts, demonstrating that BOTMAGNIFIER accurately identifies and tracks botnets.

Future work will focus on finding new data inputs to populate our initial seed pools and obtaining more comprehensive transaction logs to identify spamming bots more comprehensively. Analyzing larger data streams might allow us to apply more features, producing more complete results.
