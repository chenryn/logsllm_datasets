**Title: On Trust: Stories from the Front Lines at Black Hat US 2019**

As consumers, we frequently read about major data breaches and experience a familiar sense of disappointment. We feel disempowered, helpless, and without recourse. Our anger stems from being treated as mere commodities, and our frustration is fueled by the belief that nothing will change.

On the other hand, as security practitioners and business leaders, we often lose sight of the perspectives of our stakeholders—our customers, investors, regulators, and others who are affected by the success or failure of our work. While we focus on strengthening controls and obtaining compliance certifications, we often overlook the most damaging consequence of a breach: the loss of TRUST.

In this session, I will share my experiences leading the security programs of some of the world's leading companies through times of significant change. We will explore how a company's response to adversity or growth opportunities can shape its long-term reputation. Just like individuals, companies develop a character, and a key determinant of that character is their approach to security and privacy. This character can either lead to or undermine the trust they earn.

We will examine several major industry events over the past few years as examples of companies that have successfully (and unsuccessfully) navigated transformative changes. It is clear that the pendulum is swinging toward giving consumers more control over their relationships with firms, with landmark changes such as the "right to be forgotten," the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and, most recently, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

Firms must act quickly and decisively to build trust with their stakeholders, or risk losing customer preference, facing strict regulation, and suffering other detrimental business outcomes. Security practitioners play a uniquely valuable role in leading and supporting a company’s ability to maintain trust. Join us to learn about the evolving role of security in business and society, and gain practical insights you can apply to champion trust within your organization.
