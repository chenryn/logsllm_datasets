## Abstract
This workshop addresses the technical challenges arising from our interconnected society. With the proliferation of devices and people connected through intelligent algorithms, apps, social networks, and the Internet of Things (IoT), issues of security, privacy, and trust remain significant. Multimedia in IoT services should provide robust and resilient security platforms and solutions against unauthorized access. Recent literature highlights increased concerns about hacking, security breaches, data manipulation, social engineering, and new attack methods. Malware can be hidden within multimedia files, and visiting infected websites can trigger its download to victims' machines. Various techniques exist for stealing personal information and sensitive media for unauthorized dissemination, and imposters/identity thefts are common in social networks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of resilient security and privacy solutions, methods such as new standards, advanced cryptography, improved intrusion detection algorithms, personalized privacy, and isolation of questionable or malicious files can be used independently or in combination to minimize threats.

Multimedia has expanded beyond its original definition. The rise of social media allows for the creation of large quantities of multimedia content (e.g., pictures, videos, data, analytics, and personal information) in a short period. When stored in cloud environments, this data can be accessed, shared, commented on, and stored by many users. IoT represents a collection of devices, platforms, and software that enable people to store and share data in the cloud, connecting various types of clouds. Thus, multimedia in the IoT serves a significant purpose, as people's updates, statuses, locations, and live actions can be seen, disseminated, tracked, commented on, and monitored in near real-time. This opens up many possibilities but also increases fraudulent activities, cybercrimes, unauthorized access, malicious attacks, phishing, and impersonation/identity theft. These challenges include access control, authentication, data leakage, permission, social engineering, denial of service, and identity management. Additionally, new problems such as large-scale attacks, the strength of security protection (e.g., common encryption algorithms), hiding malware with multimedia, location-based privacy, underground criminal networks, and hidden security breaches present further challenges.

## Workshop Overview
The 1st International Workshop on Multimedia Privacy and Security (MPS), held as part of CCS 2017, focuses on these concerns specific to the IoT ecosystem. We solicited submissions on new and innovative methods, techniques, and proof-of-concepts supported by strong theory, algorithms, and simulation/experiments. We accepted five submissions and organized the workshop around talks for these publications, featuring a keynote by Dr. Jeremy Epstein of the NSF and a panel discussion.
