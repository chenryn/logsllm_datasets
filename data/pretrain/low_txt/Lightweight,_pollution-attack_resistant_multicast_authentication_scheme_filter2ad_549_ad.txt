### 5. Security Analysis

In this section, we analyze the difficulty of computing valid evidence for a packet without prior knowledge of the full TSK (Temporal Secret Key) chain.

#### Case 1: No Prior Knowledge of TSK
Assume the attacker has no elements of the TSK. On average, an adversary must guess \((2^b - 1)p\) hash values, where \(b\) is the number of bits per element and \(p\) is the number of elements in each piece of evidence. The complexity of finding valid evidence for a packet can be denoted as \(O(2^{bp})\).

#### Case 2: Partial Knowledge of TSK
We derive the probability \(P_f\) of the adversary producing valid evidence for a packet given \(n\) TSK elements. Since each element in the TSK will not be reused, except those in the first TSK chain, TSK0, we assume that only the reused elements of TSK0 affect the security of PARM. The TSK has a chain length \(L\) and \(k\) elements per TSK. If the known elements are distributed among each TSK, then \(n/L\) denotes the number of these elements in TSK0. Without executing the temporal key renewal phase, we derive a tight upper bound for \(P_f\):

\[ P_f = \left( \frac{n}{L} \cdot \frac{1}{k} \right)^p \]

We define the security strength \(S\) as:

\[ S = \frac{1}{P_f} = \left( \frac{Lk}{n} \right)^p \]

**Equation 5.1:**

\[ P_f = \left( \frac{n}{Lk} \right)^p \]

**Equation 5.2:**

\[ S = \left( \frac{Lk}{n} \right)^p \]

Equation 5.2 shows that the security strength \(S\) increases in direct proportion to the number of TSK elements \(k\) or TSK chain length \(L\) and decreases with the number of used TSK elements \(n\). The security strength \(S\) decreases if the probability \(P_f\) increases too much.

#### Case 3: Temporal Key Renewal
In the final case, we execute the temporal key renewal phase, rendering any evidence obtained by the attacker useless. With a security strength of \(E+11\), while the security strength remains above \(E+19\) for a threshold of 50. From the figure, we can conclude that a small threshold can sustain higher security strength than a large threshold; therefore, key renewal is essential to guarantee security.

### 7. Conclusion

Pollution attacks in multicast networks pose a significant problem for authentication. Despite past efforts, researchers have not been able to develop an efficient solution. This paper proposes a new approach to resisting pollution attacks that offers lightweight computational overhead to both the sender and receiver, allowing the receiver to instantly validate packets without the need for invalid packets. The partial key renewal mechanism provides a guarantee on a lower bound of security regardless of the amount of disclosed TSK elements. In addition to SAIDA, other signature amortization schemes that rely on fault-tolerant algorithms to defend against pollution attacks could benefit from our proposed approach.

We provide an analysis of storage, communication, and computational overhead, demonstrating that our proposed scheme is relatively lightweight compared to previous solutions. We also evaluate our scheme under various conditions to help senders define operating parameters suitable for their local network. Because the storage size of the TSK elements array is considerable, we aim to reduce the storage overhead in future work.
