The Threat Hunter Playbook is a community-driven, open-source project aimed at sharing detection logic, adversary tradecraft, and resources to enhance the efficiency of detection development. All detection documents in this project are structured according to the [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) framework, which categorizes post-compromise adversary behavior into tactical groups. These documents are available as [interactive Jupyter notebooks](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/projects/architecture/content-architecture.html#the-jupyter-notebook-format). The use of Jupyter notebooks allows us to share not only text, queries, and expected outputs but also code, enabling users to run detection logic against [pre-recorded security datasets](https://securitydatasets.com) locally or remotely through [BinderHub](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) cloud computing environments.

## Goals

- Accelerate the development of techniques and hypotheses for hunting campaigns.
- Assist security researchers in understanding patterns of behavior observed during post-exploitation.
- Provide resources for validating analytics locally or remotely through cloud computing environments, free of charge.
- Map pre-recorded datasets to adversarial techniques.
- Enhance information security learning through open-source resources.
