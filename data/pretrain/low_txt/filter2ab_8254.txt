**ATT&CK ID:** T1423  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Network Service Scanning

Adversaries may attempt to enumerate services running on remote hosts, with the aim of identifying those that are potentially vulnerable to remote software exploitation. To gather this information, attackers can employ methods such as port scans and vulnerability scans, which can be conducted from a mobile device. This technique leverages the mobile device's access to an internal enterprise network, whether through local connectivity or via a Virtual Private Network (VPN).
