## Crowd-Sourced Bounties Tips
- **Speed is Key:** Due to the risk of duplicates, speed is crucial to ensure a decent ROI.
- **Be Prepared:** Many platforms provide a heads-up on new bounties; be ready to start immediately.
- **Quick Reporting:** When finding a vulnerability, quickly create a PoC, write a short report, and submit it immediately to avoid ending up with just kudos instead of cash.

## Brokers: A Better Approach?
- **Broker Role:** Researchers work with brokers to find the best market and price to sell their information.
- **Avenues:** Can include gray and black markets.
- **Maximizing Earnings:** Generally considered the way to get the most money for your research.
- **Reporting and Coordination:** Directly with the broker who handles the entire transaction.
- **Confidentiality:** Details of the vulnerability are never published.
