### 4.2 Authentication by Security Token

A security token will be established between the communicating parties. This token may include a time-to-live (TTL) or valid-period attribute, which defines the duration of its validity, either in terms of time or usage count. During the valid period, the communicating peers use the security token for authentication purposes. Before the TTL or valid-period expires, the gateway is relieved from subsequent authentication workloads. Based on this concept, research [17] proposes a delegation-based authentication and authorization scheme for DTLS. The advantages and disadvantages of this authentication method are as follows:

**Pros:**
- The gateway is freed from the workload of subsequent authentications after the initial setup.
- It is suitable for resource-constrained devices, as token-based authentication is computationally lightweight.

**Cons:**
- A single point of failure, such as a compromised gateway, can expose peers to threats since the initial authentication is performed by the gateway.
- Designing a scheme using security tokens can be challenging, as it must balance both security requirements and the resource constraints of the peers.

In the authentication-by-security-token model, the domestic gateway distributes a security token to the communicating peers. Upon receiving the token, the peers use it to authenticate each other, thereby shifting the authentication workload from the gateway to the peers. The valid period of the security token can be short if the peers are resource-constrained and cannot afford strong security protection. This makes the model friendly to resource-constrained devices. Compared to previous models, this approach is also applicable to centralized communication over public networks. The gateway's overhead is limited to setting up and managing the security tokens.

### 4.3 Authentication by Trust Chain

In this model, the trust relationship "peer A trusts peer B" is defined as follows: Peer A is convinced that the incoming data D is from peer C if peer B certifies that data D is from peer C. This forms a trust graph, a connected and directed graph where the successor of a directed edge trusts the predecessor. The gateway acts as the predecessor for all peers in the domestic registration domain, and a public authority certifies the gateway. If two communication peers from different trust graphs need to authenticate each other, one or more edges should be added to concatenate the two trust graphs. In this configuration, both peers can find a common trusted predecessor that certifies the other peer. Existing standards, such as X.509 PKI (IETF RFC 5280) and DNSSEC [18], use a trust graph structure.

For example, an authentication method based on X.509 PKI uses digital certificates for authentication. In the setup phase, the gateway requests a digital certificate from a public Certificate Authority (CA) and issues its own proprietary certificates to the domestic objects. For simplicity, the proprietary certificate does not need to follow the X.509 standard format, but all communication peers must agree to use the proprietary authentication method. After the setup phase, domestic peers can achieve mutual authentication with all peers that trust the same proprietary CA.

**Pros:**
- After the setup phase, there is no further authentication workload on the gateway, reducing the overall authentication load.
- This model is based on a trust chain, and in practice, authentication standards provide better security functionalities compared to basic methods.
- Instead of applying for a certificate for each domestic object, a proprietary CA is used, reducing the cost of obtaining public certificates.

**Cons:**
- The complexity of this authentication scheme may make it unsuitable for resource-constrained objects, as it requires significant computational power.
- The model uses similar methods for both domestic and foreign peers, making it inflexible.
- A single point of failure, such as a compromised gateway, can break the trust chain.

A prerequisite for this model is that the home/organization owner must have a CA for all objects, and this CA must obtain a digital certificate from an upper-tier CA to establish the trust chain. For traveling objects to phone home, no trust graph concatenation is required if the digital certificate is issued by the domestic gateway. However, if an object is owned by an outsider, trust graph concatenation is necessary, requiring the communicating parties to acquire all intermediate digital certificates to construct the trust chain. This shifts the authentication workload to the communicating objects, making it less suitable for certain resource-constrained devices.

### 4.4 Authentication by Global Trust Tree

Unlike the trust-chain model, a global trust tree is used, where all peers are registered. This allows for global authentication. Currently, no global trust trees are available, but DNSSEC could potentially be used to construct one [19]. However, practical issues [20][21] need to be resolved before implementation.

**Pros:**
- A global trust graph is more reliable in terms of management compared to a private gateway-based trust architecture.
- The gateway does not intervene in the authentication process, allowing it to focus on network traffic forwarding.
- The underlying scheme is generally an international standard, providing robust mutual authentication.

**Cons:**
- A global trust graph is not currently available in the Internet framework.
- Constructing a global trust graph that includes all IoT objects is expensive and may be infeasible.
- Even if a global trust graph is available, the registration fees for all domestic objects would be high.

Compared to the trust-chain model, the global trust tree can enforce strict rules for managing digital certificates. In this model, the gateways of the communicating peers do not participate in the authentication process; their primary task is routing network traffic. However, the communicating objects must be capable of performing data authentication, which can be problematic for resource-constrained devices. Therefore, it is more appropriate to centralize data retrieval over public networks or cloud computing environments to reduce the amount of data exchanged.

### 5. Conclusion

This paper investigates emerging security threats and countermeasures in the Internet of Things (IoT), particularly focusing on challenges related to sensitive and private information exchanged between traveling objects and objects at home/organization. Naming, identity management, and authentication of IoT objects are key issues for secure communication and data retrieval. Based on various communication scenarios in IoT, we have outlined several potential authentication schemes. We hope this work will motivate further research to address security concerns in the deployment of IoT.
