## Abstract
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are increasingly critical for societal well-being, encompassing areas such as electricity generation and distribution, water treatment, and implantable medical devices. The integration of computing, communication, and physical control in these systems offers significant benefits in terms of efficiency and convenience. However, this convergence also introduces unique security and privacy challenges, making CPS the new frontier for cyber risk. CPS-SPC, now in its fourth edition, aims to provide a focal point for the research community to address these challenges comprehensively and multidisciplinarily, and to build a comprehensive research roadmap in tandem with other efforts.

## 1. Introduction
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) integrate computing and communication capabilities with the monitoring and control of entities in the physical world. These systems typically consist of networked agents, including sensors, actuators, control processing units, and communication devices. While some forms of CPS are already in use, the widespread growth of wireless embedded sensors and actuators is creating new applications in areas such as medical devices, autonomous vehicles, and smart infrastructure. This growth is also increasing the role of information infrastructure in existing control systems, such as those in the process control industry or the power grid.

Many CPS applications are safety-critical; their failure can cause irreparable harm to the physical system under control and to the people who depend on, use, or operate it. Critical cyber-physical infrastructures, such as electric power grids, oil and natural gas systems, water and wastewater treatment plants, and transportation networks, play a fundamental and large-scale role in society. Their disruption can have a significant impact on individuals and nations. Therefore, securing these CPS infrastructures is vitally important.

The challenges in securing CPS are numerous. Unlike traditional cybersecurity concerns of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA), which dominate IT systems, CPS security must be approached from the perspective of how attacks on CIA properties affect control-theoretic properties such as controllability, observability, and stability, and consequently, system safety. CPS-SPC 2018 aims to bring together a community around the security and privacy challenges in CPS. It is held in conjunction with the ACM Computer and Communications Security (CCS) conference, a flagship annual event of ACM SIGSAC (Special Interest Group on Security, Audit, and Control) and a premier security conference. The co-location of these two events brings advantages to both and to the community itself.

## 2. Scope
CPS-SPC 2018 encourages participation from researchers and practitioners from diverse CPS domains and multiple disciplinary backgrounds, including but not limited to information security, control theory, embedded systems, and human factors. The workshop provides a forum for researchers to share ideas and results, discuss emerging technologies and trends that impact CPS, study differences and commonalities across different CPS domains, and build a multidisciplinary body of knowledge in this developing sub-field.

This year’s workshop builds on the foundations laid by the last three editions and invites submissions at the interface of control theory, information security, embedded and real-time systems, and human factors, among others, as applied to CPS. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Mathematical foundations for secure CPS
- Control-theoretic approaches to secure CPS
- High-assurance security architectures for CPS
- Security and resilience metrics for CPS
- Metrics and risk assessment approaches for CPS
- Privacy in CPS
- Network security for CPS
- Game theory applied to CPS security
- Security of embedded systems, IoT, and real-time systems in the context of CPS
- Safety in CPS
- Human factors and humans in the loop
- Understanding dependencies among security, reliability, and safety
- Economics of security and privacy in CPS
- Intrusion detection in CPS
- Model-based security systems engineering
- Experimental insights from real-world CPS or CPS testbeds

CPS domains of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Health care and medical devices
- Manufacturing
- Industrial control systems
- SCADA systems
- Robotics
- Smart building environments
- Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
- Autonomous vehicles
- Transportation systems and networks

Papers that can point the research community to new directions and set research agendas and priorities in CPS security and privacy are also of interest.

## 3. Program
CPS-SPC 2018 is a one-day workshop held on October 19, 2018. The program comprises three technical sessions with talks on accepted short and regular-length research papers. This year, the workshop received 22 papers from authors in 15 different countries and accepted 8 full and 2 short papers for presentation.

### 4.2 PC Co-Chairs
- **Awais Rashid**: Professor of Cyber Security at the University of Bristol, UK. He leads multiple research projects on CPS, including two projects as part of the UK Research Institute on Trustworthy Industrial Control Systems (RITICS) and an EU project (with KU Leuven and University College Cork) on adaptive security for CPS under attack. He also co-leads the Security and Safety Stream within the UK Research Hub on Cyber Security of the Internet of Things (PETRAS) and leads research on human factors for CPS as part of the UK Research Institute on Science of Cyber Security (RISCS). He served on the PC of the first two CPS-CPC workshops at CCS and was co-chair for CPS-SPC 2017. Rashid is also leading a major project on developing a cyber-security body of knowledge (CyBOK).
- **Nils Ole Tippenhauer**: Faculty at the CISPA Helmholtz Zentrum i.G. Before joining CISPA, he was an Assistant Professor at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (established in collaboration with MIT), where he developed the design-centric curriculum for the first generation of students. He has made contributions in several applied aspects of CPS security, ranging from the design, analysis, and implementation of wireless localization protocols and systems, to applied attacks and process-based attack detection in industrial control systems. Nils was also involved in several applied projects involving mobile sensor nodes, such as the large-scale cloud-assisted National Science Experiment, with 50,000 nodes designed and deployed for students in Singapore.
