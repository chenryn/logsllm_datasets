### Glossary

- **Apache**: An open-source HTTP server integrated into Mac OS X Server. Detailed information is available at [www.apache.org](http://www.apache.org).

- **Application Server**: Software that runs and manages web applications, which are accessed via a web browser. The managed applications reside on the same computer as the application server.

- **CGI (Common Gateway Interface)**: A script or program that adds dynamic functionality to a website. It facilitates communication between a website and an application, processing user inputs and generating responses.

- **Everyone**: Any user who can log in to a file server, including registered users, guests, anonymous FTP users, and website visitors.

- **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)**: A set of symbols or codes inserted into a file to be displayed on a web browser. HTML instructs the browser on how to display text and images.

- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: The client/server protocol for the World Wide Web, enabling web browsers to access web servers and request hypermedia documents created using HTML.

- **IP (Internet Protocol)**: Also known as IPv4, it works with Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to send data between computers over a local network or the Internet. IP delivers data packets, while TCP tracks them.

- **IP Address**: A unique numeric address that identifies a computer on the Internet.

- **JavaScript**: A scripting language used to add interactivity to webpages.

- **JBoss**: A full-featured Java application server supporting Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE) applications.

- **Mac OS X Server**: A robust server platform supporting Mac, Windows, UNIX, and Linux clients, providing scalable workgroup and network services, and advanced remote management tools.

- **MySQL**: An open-source relational database management tool for web servers.

- **Open Source**: A development model where software source code is published, allowing a large community of developers to submit modifications and enhancements.

- **Owner**: The person who created a file or folder, having the ability to assign access privileges. The owner automatically has read/write privileges and can transfer ownership to another user.

- **PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor)**: A scripting language embedded in HTML, used to create dynamic webpages.

- **Port**: A virtual endpoint used by servers to determine which application should receive data packets. Firewalls use port numbers to control data packet traversal.

- **Protocol**: A set of rules governing data transmission between two applications.

- **Proxy Server**: A server that sits between a client application (e.g., a web browser) and a real server, intercepting requests and fulfilling them if possible, or forwarding them to the real server.

- **Realm (WebDAV Realm)**: A region of a website, typically a folder or directory, defined to provide access for WebDAV users and groups.

- **Short Name**: An abbreviated name for a user, used by Mac OS X for home directories, authentication, and email addresses.

- **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)**: An Internet protocol enabling encrypted, authenticated information exchange across the Internet.

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: A method used with the Internet Protocol (IP) to send data in message units between computers. IP handles delivery, while TCP tracks individual data packets.

- **Tomcat**: The official reference implementation for Java Servlet 2.2 and JavaServer Pages 1.1, developed under the Java Community Process.

- **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)**: The address of a resource accessible on a local network or the Internet, consisting of the protocol, domain name, and file location.

- **User Name**: The long name for a user, also known as the "real" name. See also "short name."

- **WebDAV (Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning)**: A live authoring environment allowing client users to check out, modify, and check in webpages while a site is running.
