### Introduction

Security vulnerabilities often arise from weak implementations in software (e.g., a hypervisor) or hardware (e.g., a chipset system error reporting mechanism) that are internal to the host. Our attack exploits various design aspects of Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) devices, specifically targeting the interoperability of SR-IOV devices with external software and hardware.

### Standardization Efforts

The Data Center Bridging Task Group, part of the IEEE 802.1 Working Group, is working on standardizing the configuration, management, and communication of virtual stations connected to adjacent bridges. The group has proposed two standards: 802.1Qbg Edge Virtual Bridging [10] and 802.1BR Bridge Port Extension [11]. These standards focus on the configuration and management of bridge services for virtual stations but do not address flow control. To our knowledge, this work is the first to highlight the problem of self-virtualizing devices in converged enhanced Ethernet environments with flow control and to propose a solution.

### Conclusions and Future Work

Self-virtualizing devices with SR-IOV are foundational in modern enterprise data centers, cloud computing, and high-performance computing setups. We have shown that, as currently deployed on Ethernet networks, SR-IOV is incompatible with required functionalities such as flow control. This incompatibility stems from the assumption that each endpoint is trusted, which is not the case with SR-IOV, where each network endpoint can consist of multiple, possibly untrusted, virtual machines.

We have demonstrated how to overcome this flaw by teaching the Network Interface Card (NIC) about virtual functions. Our prototype, VANFC, is 100% effective in securing SR-IOV against this flaw without imposing any overhead on throughput or latency-sensitive workloads.

### Future Directions

Future work includes:
- Further investigating the security of SR-IOV devices.
- Extending our work from Ethernet to other networking technologies like InfiniBand and Fiber Channel.
- Examining the security of direct-assigned self-virtualizing devices other than NICs, such as high-end NVMe SSDs and GPGPUs.
- Developing techniques for detecting co-residency of virtual functions.
- Using the hypervisor to address the problem of VM ring buffer exhaustion, which will be challenging to handle in software without performance loss.
- Continuing the evaluation of VANFC and exploring the potential for a hardware-based implementation.
