### Summary of the Log Chunk

This log chunk, spanning from 18:08:54 to 18:09:00 on October 18th, highlights several recurring issues within the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and Resource Manager (RM) components. The key points are as follows:

1. **Lease Renewal Failures**:
   - The `LeaseRenewer` process, identified by `msrabi@msra-sa-41:9000`, is failing to renew a lease for the client `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1`. The failure duration increases from 237 seconds to 242 seconds over the log period.
   - Each failure is followed by a message indicating that the system will retry shortly.

2. **Address Changes**:
   - Both the `LeaseRenewer` and `RMCommunicator Allocator` processes detect address changes. Specifically, the old address `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030` or `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` is being updated to `msra-sa-41:8030` or `msra-sa-41:9000`, respectively.
   - These address changes are detected multiple times during the log period.

3. **Resource Manager Communication Issues**:
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` process is unable to contact the RM server at `msra-sa-41:8030`.
   - The system attempts to retry the connection with a retry policy of `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep` (maxRetries=10, sleepTime=1000 MILLISECONDS).
   - Each retry attempt is logged, and an error message `ERROR IN CONTACTING RM` is generated after each failed attempt.

  - **18:08:56**: Error in contacting RM.
  - **18:08:58**: Retry attempt to connect to `msra-sa-41:8030` (0 retries so far).
  - **18:08:58**: Error in contacting RM.

  - **18:09:00**: Error in contacting RM.

### Conclusion

The log indicates persistent issues with lease renewals and communication with the RM server. The repeated address changes and failed attempts to renew the lease and contact the RM server suggest potential network or configuration issues that need to be addressed.
