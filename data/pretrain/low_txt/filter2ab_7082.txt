**Title: BlackHat US-21 Internal Affairs: Hacking File System Access from the Web**

The File System Access API, which was introduced to browsers this year, is based on a W3C draft. This API allows websites, with user consent, to read, write, and edit files and folders selected by the user on their devices. It builds upon an earlier proposal known as the Native File System. The API has been implemented in many Chromium-based browsers.

Despite the various security measures built into the API, this presentation will demonstrate several methods by which a malicious website could potentially execute arbitrary code and bypass operating system and security product scans, or even evade detailed manual inspection.
