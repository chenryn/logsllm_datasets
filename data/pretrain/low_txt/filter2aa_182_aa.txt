### Overview of Unified Communications (UC)

#### Definition of UC
- **Unified Communications (UC)**
  - Integrates various communication methods such as:
    - Voice (VoIP)
    - Video (IP Video)
    - Presence and Instant Messaging (IM)
    - Computer Telephony Integration (CTI) – Desktop Integration
    - Unified Messaging (e.g., voicemail and email in the same inbox)

#### Business Cases for UC
- **IP Video**
  - **Private IP Video Calling**: Enables video calls between individuals using IP video handsets or soft phone applications.
  - **Telepresence**: High-definition video conferencing that can significantly reduce travel costs. For example:
    - **HSBC**: Saved $604,000 in air travel bills.
    - **Wachovia**: Reduced air travel expenses through telepresence solutions.
  - **IP Video Surveillance**: Utilized by government, military, banks, casinos, and museums for enhanced security.
  - **IP Video Streaming Applications**: Used in entertainment venues and professional sports stadiums, such as Cowboys Stadium, Yankee Stadium, and Toronto Blue Jays' stadium.

#### Real-world Examples
- **Cowboys Stadium**
  - **Cost**: $1.1 billion
  - **Technology Features**:
    - Cisco Connected Sports Technologies
    - 240 miles of fiber optic cable
    - 2,800 TV monitors, each with an IP address
    - 180 wireless access points
    - Technology Conference Room and Auditorium
    - RFID-embedded bracelets for child safety
    - Two 60-yard-long HDTV video boards (largest in the world, manufactured by Mitsubishi, costing $40 million)

### New UC Attacks

#### Video Replay
- **Example 1**: An attacker replays a safe video stream in an IP video surveillance system, creating a "blind camera" scenario where malicious events occur without the operator's knowledge.
- **Example 2**: An attacker intercepts a live video conference presented by the CEO and replays a previous conference or a private session, potentially causing misinformation.

#### IP Video Hijack (Video Interception)
- **Example 1**: During a high-profile sporting event, an attacker plays a random movie clip (including inappropriate content).
- **Example 2**: In an important video conference, the attacker intercepts the video stream to play a random movie clip, disrupting the meeting.

#### Video Eavesdropping (Video Recording)
- **Example 1**: Eavesdropping on a private IP video call between the CFO and CEO.
- **Example 2**: Eavesdropping on a video conference.
- **Example 3**: Reconstructing a safe video stream to play in a loop against a video surveillance camera.
