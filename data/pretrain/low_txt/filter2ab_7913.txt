### Title: DnD: Decompiling Deep Neural Network Compiled Binaries

**Abstract:**

The use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has grown significantly in recent years, particularly in edge devices and embedded systems. To achieve optimal performance on these platforms, DNN compilers are often used to convert DNN models into binary executables. However, this compilation process makes the original DNN model inaccessible, thereby preventing the application of various security techniques such as model extraction, white-box adversarial sample generation, and model patching.

In this paper, we introduce DnD, the first Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)- and compiler-agnostic DNN decompiler. DnD employs a customized symbolic execution approach to lift the DNN binary into symbolic expressions, represented in a novel intermediate representation (IR). This IR abstracts high-level mathematical DNN operations in a manner that is independent of both the ISA and the compiler. DnD then matches these lifted mathematical operations with reference DNN operations, enabling the recovery of hyper-parameters, parameters, and the overall topology of the DNN model.

We evaluate DnD on DNN binaries compiled by two different compilers (Glow and TVM) and for three different ISAs (Thumb, AArch64, and x86-64). Our results demonstrate that DnD can perfectly recover the model information from these binaries. Furthermore, we successfully reverse-engineer DNN models from binaries deployed on real-world microcontrollers and apply white-box adversarial machine learning techniques to attack these models.
