### Security Analysis and Comparison of Proposed Behavioral Biometrics Schemes

#### 1. Security of S-Pattern
The S-Pattern scheme is vulnerable to replay attacks if an attacker can record a user's valid interaction with the underlying authentication construct. Theoretically, the attacker could bypass the system by replaying the recorded values. However, in a real-world scenario, such an attack is not straightforward. A physical robot or human impersonator would need to accurately mimic the user's interaction with the device, which is measured by the touch screen and motion-position sensors. This adds a significant layer of complexity to the attack.

#### 2. Security of CR-Pattern
The CR-Pattern scheme is more secure than the S-Pattern due to the added randomization and interactivity. Simply recording and replaying user interactions is insufficient for bypassing the security provided by this scheme. To successfully attack CR-Pattern, the attacker must understand the pattern they need to re-enter and then try to mimic the user. This is challenging because the pattern shown at any given time is typically different from previously shown and recorded patterns. The attacker could attempt to learn the user's interaction style by recording multiple sessions and then trying to input the new pattern using the learned knowledge. This makes CR-Pattern much more robust against impersonation attacks compared to S-Pattern, leveraging the inherent benefits of challenge-response authentication.

#### 3. Security of Gametrics
To solve a Gametrics challenge, the attacker must understand the content of the images, identify the relationships between the target and moving objects, and then drag and drop the answer objects to their corresponding targets. Additionally, the attacker must mimic the user's interactions with the challenges as measured by the touchscreen, motion, and position sensors. Furthermore, the attacker needs to match the timing of solving the challenge with that of the legitimate user, which involves matching cognitive features. 

Attacking Gametrics with a human impersonator is challenging, as it requires mimicking approximately 70 features used in the classification models. Automated attacks are also difficult due to the complexity of solving two hard AI problems: (1) understanding the contents of the images, and (2) finding semantic relationships. Such challenges are considered difficult for automated algorithms to solve, and Gametrics has even been suggested for use as CAPTCHAs to distinguish between humans and bots.

In summary, the interactivity and randomization in Gametrics allow for the extraction of more features that aid in identifying the user, making it harder for attackers to mimic all required features, including cognitive ones.

### Discussion and Future Work

In this study, we analyzed three different schemes for authenticating users on mobile devices based on behavioral biometrics. The three schemes differ in terms of usability and security. S-Pattern offers high usability due to its short authentication time but is vulnerable to various impersonation attacks. CR-Pattern and Gametrics have similar completion times and offer better security compared to S-Pattern. The randomization in CR-Pattern and Gametrics, especially in the latter, makes these schemes more resistant to attacks due to the inclusion of cognitive behavioral properties.

Our study demonstrates that utilizing sensors in the three schemes improves the accuracy of user identification. Additionally, incorporating more features makes it harder for attackers to mimic all required characteristics. Traditional password-based authentication on mobile phones takes an average of up to 21 seconds, while the proposed schemes require significantly less time: about 1 second for S-Pattern, around 6.5 seconds for CR-Pattern, and 8 seconds for Gametrics. S-Pattern is suitable for phone locking, while CR-Pattern and Gametrics are more appropriate for app authentication, such as banking apps or photo privacy.

Gametrics can be integrated with graphical passwords, such as those involving Random Arts images, PassObjects, and PassFaces, as well as recall or cued recall methods like drawings and PassPoints, to enhance security against spoofing attacks. It can also serve as a fallback authentication method, requiring periodic user engagement to maintain an up-to-date classification model. Further investigation is needed to explore additional use cases, such as confirming user identity when continuous authentication schemes fail.

In future work, we aim to reduce the time required for the authentication process and study how the performance of the biometrics changes with different devices. We will also investigate the impact of emotional changes, sickness, and various motion scenarios on authentication accuracy. While the results are promising, more work is needed to further reduce authentication time, test the schemes on larger and more diverse user pools, and compare the three schemes in terms of user perception and acceptability.

### Related Work

Behavioral biometrics on smartphones have been extensively studied, with most approaches focusing on touchstroke footprints and implicit behavioral gestures. Few studies, such as those by Al Galib et al. [2] and Chen et al. [13], have explored user authentication based on cognitive abilities. Al Galib et al. [2] utilized a game to capture users' cognitive processes, while Chen et al. [13] proposed a method to identify users based on gameplay activities, achieving high accuracy with a 20-minute detection time.

Other notable works include Conti et al. [14], who proposed a system that transparently authenticates users by analyzing hand movement gestures during phone calls, and Buriro et al. [9, 10, 11], who introduced bimodal and multimodal authentication systems based on touchstroke patterns and device movements. Gascon et al. [19] and Lee et al. [22] presented approaches for continuous authentication on smartphones by analyzing typing motion behavior.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we studied two challenge-response methods for behavioral biometric authentication on mobile devices and compared them with an existing static graphical pattern biometric scheme. Our findings show that utilizing motion sensors improves the accuracy of user detection and security against impersonation attacks. While challenge-response schemes enhance security, they slightly increase the time required for authentication. Game-based biometric schemes, such as Gametrics, offer similar accuracy and completion times as challenge-response pattern biometric schemes but provide a higher level of security. Each of the three schemes can be used in different applications depending on the desired balance between security and usability.
