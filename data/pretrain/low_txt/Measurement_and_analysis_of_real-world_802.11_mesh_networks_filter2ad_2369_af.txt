### Figure 15: Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the Fraction of Hidden Triples to Relevant Triples

Figure 15 illustrates the CDF of the fraction of hidden triples relative to relevant triples, using a threshold of 10%. Our results remain consistent across different threshold values. For each of our 802.11b/g networks, we used probe data to determine the number of relevant triples at each bit rate and then calculated the proportion that were hidden triples. The CDF is aggregated over all networks; for instance, approximately 13% of networks had fewer than 50% hidden triples at 1 Mbit/s.

Generally, as the bit rate increases, the fraction of hidden triples also increases. An exception is observed at 6 Mbit/s and 11 Mbit/s, where there are consistently fewer hidden triples at 11 Mbit/s compared to 6 Mbit/s. This anomaly can be attributed to the fact that 11 Mbit/s uses Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) rather than Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM), which is known to perform better in 802.11 networks at lower Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) values. Note that 1 Mbit/s also uses DSSS, while all other bit rates use OFDM.

### Figure 16: Hidden Triples Considering the Capture Effect

Figure 16 shows the CDF of hidden triples at a 10% threshold, taking into account the capture effect with a 10 dB threshold. The capture effect, a property of 802.11 radios, allows a strong signal to be decoded even in the presence of a weaker, simultaneous signal. For example, if AP1 and AP2 both transmit to AP3, but AP1's signal is much stronger, AP1's communication may not be disrupted by AP2's signal, provided the SNR difference exceeds a certain threshold. This threshold can vary; Ware et al. [36] found that a 5 dB difference is sufficient under certain conditions, while others report higher values up to 20 dB [26].

Using a conservative estimate of 10 dB, we again estimated the number of hidden triples at each bit rate. The results show that approximately 7% of networks had fewer than 50% hidden triples at 1 Mbit/s, and the percentage of hidden triples generally increases with the bit rate, except at 6 Mbit/s and 11 Mbit/s.

### Discussion

Our findings indicate that hidden triples are quite common. Even at the lowest bit rate of 1 Mbit/s, the median value of hidden triples is about 7% when considering the capture effect and 13% when not. However, these percentages do not directly translate to the percentage of Access Points (APs) involved in hidden triples. In fact, for each bit rate, the median percentage of APs involved in hidden triples ranges from 65% to 81% when considering the capture effect, with 46% to 63% of APs acting as AP1 or AP2. Without the capture effect, the range is 81% to 90% of APs involved, with 62% to 75% acting as AP1 or AP2.

This result represents an upper bound on the potential occurrence of hidden terminals, as not every hidden triple necessarily results in a hidden terminal. It is possible to eliminate hidden terminal occurrences by using more conservative carrier sensing parameters, but this would reduce transmission opportunities. A 10% chance of receiving packets at 1 Mbit/s indicates a very low SNR, as frame preambles are sent at this rate, meaning the preamble is undetected 90% of the time.

These results suggest that hidden terminals in real-world 802.11b/g mesh networks with static APs and current MAC protocols occur in at least 7% of triples and involve at least 65% of APs. These values are higher than those assumed in previous studies [17], and in some networks, they exceed the values reported by [11]. This knowledge is valuable for systems like ZigZag [17], which require accurate models of hidden terminals for their analysis, and for estimating the throughput loss in perfect bit rate adaptation schemes. However, since our data is for static APs, it is possible that clients experience hidden terminals at different rates.

### Range Analysis

The concept of "range" in radio communication is often discussed colloquially, but it is probabilistic and dependent on the bit rate. We define the range of a network at a specific bit rate \( b \) as the number of node pairs that can communicate at that bit rate. To compare the range across different networks, we measure the change in range. We define \( R \) as the range of the network at 1 Mbit/s. For other bit rates, we plot the ratio of the range at bit rate \( b \) to \( R \).

Figure 17 shows the change in range, with error bars representing the standard deviation across all networks. Two key observations stand out. First, as expected, the mean change in range decreases as the bit rate increases. Second, there is significant variation in the drop-off, indicating that higher bit rates do not always have poorer reception properties than lower ones. Approximately 26% of networks experience at least one pair of bit rates \( b_1 < b_2 \) where the range at \( b_2 \) is higher than at \( b_1 \). Most of these cases (73%) occur between 6 Mbit/s and 11 Mbit/s, likely due to 11 Mbit/s using DSSS instead of OFDM.

### Impact of Environment

Figures 15 and 16 show that not all networks have similar proportions of hidden terminals. We briefly examine the impact of the environment—indoor or outdoor—on the number of hidden triples and the range. Outdoor networks generally have a larger range than indoor networks, and indoor networks tend to have a higher percentage of hidden triples, likely due to their higher density. In indoor networks, the median percentage of hidden triples is about 7% at 1 Mbit/s when considering the capture effect and 14% without. For outdoor networks, these percentages drop to less than 1% and 2%, respectively.

### Conclusion

This paper analyzes data from over 1407 access points in 110 commercially deployed Meraki wireless mesh networks, providing one of the largest studies of real-world 802.11 networks to date. We found that SNR is not a sufficient determinant of the optimal bit rate within a network, but it can be a good indicator on a given link with static nodes. We also found that ideal opportunistic routing protocols do not significantly reduce the number of transmissions compared to traditional unicast routing. Additionally, hidden triple situations, where nodes A, B, and C can communicate AB and BC but not AC, are more common than previously thought (a median of 13% of all triples in our results) and increase in proportion with the bit rate.

These findings provide insights into bit rate adaptation, mesh network routing, and MAC protocols to overcome interference, all of which significantly affect throughput. This paper offers more conclusive answers to questions in these areas, using a dataset larger and more diverse than any other known study.
