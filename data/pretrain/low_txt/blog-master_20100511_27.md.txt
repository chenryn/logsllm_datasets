## Background

### Ensuring High Availability with a Redundant Master

Currently, the redundant master functionality is not built into MooseFS. However, this feature is critical, and we receive numerous requests for it from various sources.

It is worth noting that even in MooseFS v1.5.x, it is relatively straightforward to write a set of scripts that can automatically start a backup master server. In version 1.6.x, this process is even simpler, with the entire switch to the backup server taking less than a minute.

One effective method is to use the Common Address Redundancy Protocol (CARP). CARP allows two machines on the same LAN to share the same IP address, one as the MASTER and the other as the BACKUP.

### Setting Up the Redundant Master

1. **Configure CARP:**
   - Set up the IP address of `mfsmaster` on a CARP interface.
   - Configure the primary machine to be the main master in the MooseFS setup.
   - Install `mfsmaster` on the backup machine but do not run it.

2. **Use `mfsmetalogger`:**
   - Starting from version 1.6.5, MooseFS includes a new program called `mfsmetalogger`. This program can be run on any machine and periodically fetches metadata from the master.
   - By default, `mfsmetalogger` retrieves a full metadata file every 24 hours and continuously updates the change log.

3. **Backup Metadata (for versions < 1.6.5):**
   - For earlier versions of MooseFS, you can set up simple scripts to run regularly (e.g., every hour) using `cron` to back up the metadata file from the main master located at `PREFIX/var/mfs/metadata.mfs.back`.

4. **Monitor and Switch:**
   - You need an additional script that continuously monitors the state of the CARP interface.
   - If the CARP interface switches to MASTER mode, the script should:
     - Fetch the two or three newest "changelog" files from any chunkserver using `scp`.
     - Run `mfsmetarestore` to restore the metadata.
     - Start `mfsmaster`.
   - The switch time should take only a few seconds, and with the time needed to reconnect the chunkservers, the new master should be fully functional within about a minute for both read and write operations.

### Future Enhancements

We are planning to add an option to run the master in read-only mode, which would be ideal for the backup machine. This would prevent potential desynchronization between the two master machines and eliminate the need to merge changes from the backup master to the main master.
