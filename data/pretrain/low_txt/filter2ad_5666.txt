**The William C. Carter Award**

Established in 1997 by the IEEE Technical Committee on Fault-Tolerant Computing (TC-FTC) and the IFIP Working Group on Dependable Computing and Fault Tolerance (WG 10.4), the William C. Carter Award honors Dr. Carter's legacy by recognizing an outstanding paper based on a graduate dissertation. The award is presented annually at the DSN Symposium (Dependable Computing and Communication Symposium).

**Eligibility and Selection Process**

To be eligible for the award, a paper must be based on a student's dissertation and submitted as a regular paper to the DCC Symposium within DSN, with the student as the first author. Both current graduate students and those who have completed their dissertations within the past two years are eligible. All submissions that are accepted as regular DCCS papers are evaluated by the DSN Steering Committee.
