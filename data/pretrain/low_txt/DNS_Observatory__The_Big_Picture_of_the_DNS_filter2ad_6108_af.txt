### DNS Caching, TTLs, and Resilience

Several research works have investigated the relationship between Time-to-Live (TTL) values and DNS caching. Since our dataset primarily monitors cache miss queries, TTLs play a crucial role in our analysis. Jung et al. [41] used simulations based on real traces to demonstrate that longer TTLs improve caching, particularly for domains with short TTLs (less than 1000 seconds). In a subsequent study [40], Jung et al. modeled DNS caches and were able to predict cache hit rates from their previous findings. Moura et al. [48] analyzed the relationship between TTLs and DNS resilience in the face of DDoS attacks. In 2007, Pappas et al. proposed changes to caching strategies for NS records to enhance DNS resilience against DDoS attacks [52].

### Query Name Minimization

RFC 7816 standardized query name minimization (qmin) in 2016 [8]. A few years later, Vries et al. presented the first study focusing on qmin deployment [13]. They found that approximately 40% of all queries to the .nl TLD and K-root nameservers were sent with qmin. However, a more recent study by Huston [34] reported only a 3% deployment of qmin, which aligns more closely with our results in Section 3.6.

## Conclusion

We introduced DNS Observatory, a novel stream analytics platform that provides unprecedented visibility into the DNS, and demonstrated some of its capabilities using real-world data. DNS Observatory is based on passive measurements and collects data from a large, diverse set of recursive resolvers spread around the world, operated by many different entities. Using various stream-oriented algorithms and probabilistic data structures, we processed a total of 1.6 trillion DNS resolver-nameserver transactions executed between January and April 2019. This comprehensive view of the DNS allows for better understanding and suggests potential improvements.

The aggregated datasets collected by DNS Observatory are already available to academic researchers upon request to the primary author of this paper or through the Farsight Security Research Grant program [19]. In the long term, we plan to make parts of the collected data publicly available through a web interface, accessible at https://www.farsightsecurity.com/.
