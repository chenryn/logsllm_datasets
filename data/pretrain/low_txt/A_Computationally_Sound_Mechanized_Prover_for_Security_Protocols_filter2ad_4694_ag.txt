### Prover Analysis of Cryptographic Protocols

#### Denning-Sacco Public-Key Protocol [23]

Our prover is unable to demonstrate the one-session secrecy of the exchanged key in the original Denning-Sacco protocol, as there is a known attack against this protocol [2]. However, the one-session secrecy of the key is proven for the corrected version [2]. The secrecy of the key cannot be fully established because an adversary can force multiple sessions to use the same key. (Note: We do not model timestamps in this protocol.)

In contrast to previous examples, we manually provide the main proof steps to the prover, as follows:

1. `SArename Rkey`
2. `crypto enc rkB`
3. `crypto sign rkS`
4. `crypto sign rkA`
5. `success`

- **Rkey**: A table of public keys assigned to principals A and B, and to other principals defined by the adversary.
- **SArename Rkey**: Distinguishes between the three cases.
- **crypto enc rkB**: Applies the definition of encryption security for the key generated from random number `rkB`.
- **success**: Checks if the desired security properties are proven.

#### Needham-Schroeder Public-Key Protocol [38]

This protocol is designed for authentication. Since our prover cannot yet check authentication, we transform it into a key exchange protocol in several ways:
- Using either of the nonces `NA` or `NB` shared between A and B.
- Using `H(NA, NB)`, where `H` is a hash function (in the random oracle model).

- **Key = H(NA, NB)**: One-session secrecy of the key cannot be proven for the original protocol due to a well-known attack [33]. For the corrected version [33], our prover shows the secrecy of the key. 
- **Key = NA or NB**: Our prover cannot prove one-session secrecy for `NA` or `NB`. 
  - For `NB`: The failure corresponds to an attack where the adversary can check if `NB` is given or a random number by sending `{N'}` to B. B accepts if and only if `N' = NB`.
  - For `NA`: The failure is due to limitations in our prover, which cannot account for `NA` being accepted only after all messages containing `NA` have been sent. This issue could potentially be resolved by improving the `Simplify` transformation.

For the transformed protocols, the main proof steps provided to the prover are as follows:

**When the distributed key is `NA` or `NB`:**
1. `SArename Rkey`
2. `crypto sign rkS`
3. `crypto enc rkA`
4. `crypto enc rkB`
5. `success`

**When the distributed key is `H(NA, NB)`:**
1. `SArename Rkey`
2. `crypto sign rkS`
3. `crypto enc rkA`
4. `crypto enc rkB`
5. `crypto hash`
6. `SArename Na_39`
7. `simplify`
8. `success`

The total runtime for these tests is 60 seconds on a Pentium M 1.8 GHz, using version 1.01 of our prover CryptoVerif.

### Conclusion

This paper introduces a prover for cryptographic protocols that is sound in the computational model. The prover operates with minimal user intervention, handles a wide variety of cryptographic primitives generically, and produces proofs valid for a polynomial number of sessions in the presence of an active adversary. This represents significant progress over previous work in this area.

We have recently extended our prover to provide exact security proofs (with explicit attack probabilities) and to prove correspondence assertions. These extensions will be discussed in a future paper. Future work will also aim to handle more cryptographic primitives, such as Diffie-Hellman key agreements, which may require extending the language of equivalences used to specify security properties.

I would like to extend my gratitude to David Pointcheval for his invaluable advice and explanations of computational proofs of protocols. This project would not have been possible without his support. I also thank Jacques Stern for initiating this work. This research was partially supported by ARA SSIA Formacrypt.
