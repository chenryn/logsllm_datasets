### IX. CONCLUSION

Cell phone users are frequently interrupted by robocalls, leading to a significant daily nuisance. To address this issue, telephone providers and third-party organizations have developed applications that detect and block these unwanted calls. This research aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of various spam call warning designs and provide insights for future improvements in this area.

We surveyed the top ten third-party anti-robocall apps and found that all of them use blacklists to detect robocalls. Additionally, the majority of these apps employ a red bar in the middle of the screen as a spam call warning indicator. We then conducted focus groups to gather user preferences. Our participants unanimously relied on Caller ID and expressed a desire for a spam call warning that includes a checkmark and prohibition sign, along with an alerting background color that fills the entire screen.

Based on these findings, we designed and tested three different warning categories: Available, Focus, and Control (no warning). The results showed that warning designs can significantly influence user behavior and reduce reliance on Caller ID. Specifically, the number of answered spoofed calls decreased by 43% when the spam warning removed the caller's name and featured a red background in the middle of the screen.

We recommend that future research should further investigate the removal of Caller ID, explore the use of multimodal warnings (visual, audible, and physical cues), and evaluate the performance of robocall warning indicators in real-world settings.

### APPENDIX

#### A. Repeated Advice from Participants on How to Handle Spam Calls

Below are the responses received by at least two participants on handling spam calls:

1. Check the first six digits of the incoming number. If it matches yours, it is likely a spam call.
2. Check the area code and determine if the call is coming from a location you expect.
3. Block numbers that you know are spam callers.
4. Send suspicious numbers to voicemail and check the voicemail later.
5. If you receive a call from a company, it’s okay to hang up. If they really want to contact you, they’ll send a letter or email.
6. Save numbers from companies or people you trust so you’ll be sure to answer when they call.
7. If they’re asking for money over the phone, it’s a scam.
8. Sign up for the national do not call registry.
9. Report spam callers to the proper authorities or see if your provider can help you.
10. Download an app to help you.
11. Don’t answer calls from unknown numbers.
12. Ask to be removed from the spam caller’s list.

#### B. Focus Group Questions

1. Please state your name, major, and type of phone you have.
2. Please walk me through your thought process when you receive a phone call.
3. Take a moment and think about all the spam calls you’ve answered. Please recall your most memorable experience. If you don’t have a memorable experience, please discuss something about spam calls that has stuck with you.
4. You’ve recently met someone who is having a hard time with spam calls. They ask you two questions. Please state your response to each:
   - How do you know if an incoming call is a spam call?
   - What should I do about spam calls? How do I solve this problem?
5. We will now take about 10 minutes to brainstorm independently. I will be asking you two questions, and you will need to write and draw your answers. You won’t have to show the group, but we will be collecting the papers for our research.
   - If you were to use an app to help with spam calls, please illustrate and write what you think it would look like and how you’d expect it to behave.
6. I will now be showing you five photos. If you saw this on your phone, what would you think it means?

#### C. Think Aloud Questions

1. You have just downloaded this app, Authenticall, to protect you from spam calls. Without knowing how the app works, please tell me what you think you should be able to do with this application.

#### D. Interactive Study Survey Debrief Questions

1. Can you tell me about what you saw on the cell phone?
2. How did you feel while taking the survey?
3. What do you think about the various alerts you saw?
4. Did any of the alerts or things you saw stand out to you? Anything stick in your memory?
5. What did you do when you got a call from Harold Rogers or Veranda Gardens?
6. What are your thoughts about Design 1?
7. What are your thoughts about Design 2?
8. What are your thoughts about Design 3?
9. Which design did you like the most?
10. Which design did you like the least?
11. Was anything missing from the designs?

#### E. Photos Shown In Focus Group (Figure 8 and 9)

**Figure 8.** Displays what an incoming call looks like without the notifications.

**Figure 9.** All of the call notification designs available for use in the focus groups. Each notification was inspired by designs seen in the wild. Five of the 54 designs were shown to each focus group at random.
