### 2.2 Spam Analysis and Findings

#### 2.2.1 Distribution of Spam by Autonomous Systems (ASes)

The following table shows the top ASes by email volume in our legitimate email trace:

| AS Number | Country | Organization |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| 22730     | United States | Earthlink, Inc. |
| 17381     | Germany | Schlund Partner AG |
| 14699     | United States | Microsoft Corp |
| 12493     | United States | GTE.net LLC |
| 11597     | United States | Inktomi Corporation |

**Table 2: Top 10 ASes (by email volume) in our legitimate email trace.**

- 36% of all received spam originated from only 20 ASes.
- The ASes containing hosts responsible for sending large quantities of spam differ from those sending large quantities of legitimate email.

**Finding 4.3: Distribution by Country**
- Although the top two ASes from which we received spam were from Asia, 11 of the top 20 ASes from which we received spam were from the United States and comprised over 40% of all spam from the top 20 ASes.
- Nearly three times as much spam in our trace originates from ISPs based in the United States than from either of the next two most prolific countries (Korea and China, respectively).

**4.2 The Effectiveness of Blacklists**
- Given the transience of each IP address sending spam to our sinkhole, we suspected that filtering based on IP address, a method commonly employed by DNSBLs, would be relatively ineffective.
- Figure 4 indicates that IP-based blacklisting is still working reasonably well if many blacklists are consulted simultaneously:
  - 20% of spam came from IP addresses not listed in any blacklist.
  - More than 50% of such spam was listed in two or more blacklists.
  - 80% was listed in two or more blacklists.
- However, spam from spammers using "BGP spectrum agility" techniques are not blacklisted nearly as much: half of these IP addresses do not appear in any blacklist, and only about 30% of these IP addresses appear in more than one blacklist.

**Finding 4.4: Effectiveness of Blacklists**
- Nearly 80% of all spam was received from mail relays that appear in at least one of eight blacklists.
- A relatively higher fraction of Bobax drones were blacklisted, but relatively fewer IP addresses sending spam from short-lived BGP routes were blacklisted—only half of these mail relays appeared in any blacklist.
- This finding suggests that DNSBLs are effective at identifying most types of spam based on IP address, but the reality is not as bright as it appears:
  - The result is based on an aggressive approach that sends queries to eight blacklists.
  - Even the most aggressive blacklist, Spamcop, only lists about half of all spam received.
  - Many of the more aggressive blacklists have a significant number of false positives.
  - Aggressive mechanisms, such as querying eight different blacklists, are fairly ineffective at identifying IP addresses using more sophisticated cloaking techniques (e.g., the BGP spectrum agility technique).

**5. Spam from Botnets**
- We amassed circumstantial evidence suggesting that a majority of spam originates from bots.
- Using our trace of "Bobax" command and control data, we studied the patterns of spam sent from known bot-infected hosts.
- First, we studied the activity profile of drones from the "Bobax" botnet and found that the IP address space where we observe worm activity bears close similarity to the IP address space where we observed spamming activity.
- Second, we observed that about 70% of all remote hosts spamming our sinkhole—and 95% of hosts for which we could attribute some operating system—appear to be running Windows; additionally, these hosts each send relatively low volumes of spam to the sinkhole, regardless of their persistence.

**5.1 Bobax Topology**
- We studied the prevalence of spamming hosts versus the prevalence of known Bobax drones to better understand how the distribution of IP addresses of Bobax-infected hosts compared to the IP distribution of spammers in general.
- Figure 6 shows the results of this analysis, indicating that the distribution of all Bobax-infected hosts is quite similar to that of the distribution of all spammers (Figure 2).

**5.2 Operating Systems of Spamming Hosts**
- We investigated the prevalence of each operating system among the spam we received, as well as the total amount of spam we received from hosts of each type.
- Using the passive OS fingerprinting tool, p0f, incorporated into Mail Avenger, we were able to identify the operating system for about 75% of all hosts from which we received spam.
- Table 3 shows the results of this study:
  - Roughly 70% of the hosts from which we receive spam, and 95% of these hosts to which we could attribute an operating system, run Windows.
  - Only about 4% of the hosts from which we receive spam are running operating systems other than Windows, but this small set of hosts appears to be sending a significant amount of spam.
