It is our pleasure to present the program for the 2005 Performance and Dependability Symposium (PDS'05).

Since 1995, the International Performance and Dependability Symposium (IPDS) has served as a premier international forum for researchers and practitioners to share the latest advancements in evaluating the impact of faults on the operation, particularly the performance, of computer and communication systems. In the early years of PDS, faults were primarily attributed to hardware or software malfunctions. However, in recent times, the occurrence of malicious faults and attacks has emerged as a significant concern.

This yearâ€™s PDS continues its tradition of being a high-quality conference that bridges the gap between new methodological developments and their practical applications in system evaluation, focusing on both performance and dependability in a broad sense. PDS caters to the needs of both academia and industry. As in previous years, we have accepted papers that advance model-based system evaluation or that study the performance and dependability of existing or planned systems through analysis, simulation, or experimentation. This diverse selection of papers positions PDS uniquely among other conferences, which are either more systems-oriented or more methodology-focused.

In response to the call for papers, we received nearly 100 full-paper submissions. Each submission was reviewed by at least four Program Committee (PC) members and an external referee. During the plenary PC meeting, held at the Tulip Inn hotel in Zaandam, the Netherlands, on February 17-18, 2005, 27 papers were selected for inclusion in the PDS section of these proceedings. The selection process was highly competitive, and even many good papers had to be rejected. The submission and review process was managed using the web-based START system, set up and maintained by Jose Martinez at the University of Twente. We extend our sincere thanks to him for his excellent work. Financial support for the PC meeting was provided by Sun Microsystems, and we are grateful for their sponsorship.

We are proud to present this strong PDS conference program. It would not have been possible without the support of the scientific community and the local organizers in Yokohama. We thank all authors who submitted their papers to PDS'05. Due to the rigorous selection process, many authors were unfortunately disappointed. We also thank the PC members for their extensive review efforts and their participation in the PC meeting, as well as the external reviewers for their contributions. Special thanks go to DSN 2005 General Chair Takashi Nanya and Conference Coordinator Tohru Kikuno for their numerous and often unseen tasks. The general support from DSN Steering Committee Chair Paulo Verissimo and PDS Steering Committee Co-Chairs Ravi Iyer and Kishor Trivedi was invaluable and greatly appreciated. Finally, we thank all of you for being here in Yokohama and for making PDS a successful and enjoyable symposium.

Sincerely,

Boudewijn R. Haverkort
