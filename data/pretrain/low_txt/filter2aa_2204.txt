### Overview
- **Transit Systems**
- **Reverse Engineering**
- **My Discoveries**
- **The Exploit**
- **The Lessons**

---

### Brief History
- **Anatomy of a Subway Hack (2008)**
- **NFC Subway Hack (2012)**
- **How to Hack All the Transport Networks of a Country (2012)**
- **Breaking Korea Transit Card with Side-Channel Attack (2017)**

---

### How This Is Different
- **This is not illegal.**
- **We are not sneaking into the station.**
- **We are not hacking their terminals.**
- **We are not using social engineering or attacking their wired/wireless network.**
- **This is not about the hardware.**
- **We are not cracking anyone’s encryption.**
- **We are not cloning the magstripe, RFID, or NFC.**

---

### Key Focus
- **Flaws in the Application Logic**
- **Cloning is involved but it is not the vulnerability exploited.**
- **Using AppSec to attack Complex Multi-Layered Real World Solutions**

---

### Case Study: Bangkok Mass Transit System (BTS)
- **Overview:**
  - Elevated rapid transit system in Bangkok, Thailand.
  - Serves the Greater Bangkok Area.
  - Operated by Bangkok Mass Transit System PCL (BTSC).
  - 43 stations along two lines.

- **Tickets:**
  - **Stored-Value Card (NFC)**
  - **All Day Pass (Magstripe) and Single Journey (Magstripe)**
  - Two magstripes, one with a hole through it.
  - Only 0.27mm thick.

- **Gates:**
  - Entering
  - Exiting

- **Why Them?**
  - **Magstripe Usage:** There had to be something there!
  - **Threatening for Years:** Had to address this before moving on.

---

### The Equipment
- **Standard Reader/Writer:**
  - Manufactured in China.
  - Supports standards or raw read.
  - Rare errors and reliable performance.

---

### The Questions
- **Data Location**
- **Encoding Schemes**
- **Data Changes**
- **Data Meaning**
- **System Response**
- **Data Tampering**
- **Repeating states or out-of-order transitioning**

---

### Lab Work
- **Reading the Magstripes**
- **Decoding the Data**
  - Attempted decode using ISO standards (6-bit and 4-bit character sets, with and without parity).
  - No standard encoding was used.

- **Key Findings:**
  - No encryption.
  - No parity checks.
  - No longitudinal redundancy check (LRC).
  - No timestamps.
  - The "Known" section is always 100 + the price of the ticket.

---

### Field Work
- **Run Tickets Through the System**
- **Vary the Input Each Time**
- **Identify Data Changes and Meanings**
- **GUID%, Station%, Dispenser%, Turn-style%**

- **Example Data:**
  - `0x00E078401A327826E91E76ED00FF7400D20FE948AE0A41` (Issued)
  - `0x00E078401A327826E91E76ED00FF74801C0FE948D8681B` (Used, Collected)

- **Handling Rules:**
  - To Enter: Ticket must have been in “Collected” state and now in “Issued” state.
  - To Exit: Ticket must be in “Used” state.

---

### Research Under a Junta
- **Situation:**
  - Legal rights and avoiding arrest.
  - Avoiding security guards and using dip-and-dash tactics.
  - Local attitudes towards disruptions.

---

### Exploiting the System
- **What We Learned:**
  - Object-based system (Physical and Database Objects).
  - States: Issued, Used, Collected.
  - System Safeguards and Assumptions.
  - Attacks Against Their Assumptions.

- **Epic Fail!**
  - Found someone to make blank tickets.
  - Copied a large number of objects in “Issued” state.
  - Found a flaw in the handling rules: “Collected” state overrides all other states.

- **Demonstration:**
  - Original and copied tickets showing states and transitions.

---

### Turning the Exploit into an Attack
- **Plan:**
  - Buy a daily pass.
  - Copy the ticket.
  - Use the original.
  - Hand out copies.
  - Repeat the next day.

- **Results:**
  - Millions of dollars in losses.
  - Loss of face for BTS.

- **Response from BTS:**
  - Not interested in the findings.

---

### The Lessons
- **For Us:**
  - No hardware-only solution.
  - Solutions are often complex.
  - Trusting assumptions can be dangerous.
  - Measure your risk wisely.
  - Have a plan that includes the people involved.

- **For BTS:**
  - Test all layers of a solution.
  - Check your assumptions.
  - Use compensating and mitigating controls.

- **Avoiding Their Fate:**
  - Deploy second-generation systems.
  - Establish channels for sharing information.
  - Address issues raised by “the wrong people.”

---

### Final Thoughts
- **Transit Systems Are Fun**
- **They Can Also Get You in Trouble**
- **You Don’t Know Until You Try**
- **Reverse Engineering Is Key**
- **AppSec for the Win!**
