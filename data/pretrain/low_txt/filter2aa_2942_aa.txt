## Authority
This publication was developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in accordance with its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014, 44 U.S.C. § 3551 et seq., Public Law (P.L.) 113-283. NIST is responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements for federal information systems. These standards and guidelines do not apply to national security systems without the express approval of appropriate federal officials. This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130.

Nothing in this publication should be interpreted as contradicting the standards and guidelines made mandatory and binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce. The guidance provided may be used by nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright in the United States. Attribution to NIST is appreciated.

## Abstract
Organizations are increasingly concerned about the risks associated with products and services that may contain malicious functionality, are counterfeit, or are vulnerable due to poor manufacturing and development practices within the supply chain. These risks arise from decreased visibility and understanding of how technology is developed, integrated, and deployed, as well as the processes, procedures, standards, and practices used to ensure the security, resilience, reliability, safety, integrity, and quality of products and services.

This publication provides comprehensive guidance to organizations on identifying, assessing, and mitigating cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain at all levels of their operations. It integrates cybersecurity supply chain risk management (C-SCRM) into broader risk management activities by applying a multilevel, C-SCRM-specific approach. The document includes guidance on developing C-SCRM strategy implementation plans, policies, plans, and risk assessments for products and services.
