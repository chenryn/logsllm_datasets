# AzSK Sunset Notice

After nearly five years of active development, the PowerShell/Automation-based "Secure DevOps Kit for Azure (AzSK)" is being phased out through FY21. We are transitioning to a more scalable and robust solution called Azure Tenant Security Scanner (AzTS). This new solution is based on Azure Functions and a centralized scan model, where scans are performed via a managed identity with Reader access to subscriptions configured at the management group level. This approach allows us to scale efficiently with less process overhead, providing the same level of compliance visibility across several thousand subscriptions. It is also designed to accelerate our migration to native Azure security offerings such as Policy, Security Center, Management Groups, and Azure Resource Graph.

At the Core Services Engineering and Operations (CSEO) division, we plan to phase out AzSK-based Continuous Assurance completely by Q3-FY21. Additionally, we will eliminate other dependencies on AzSK (such as ARM Checker and DevOps Kit CICD Extensions) by Q4-FY21. We will continue to support critical bug fixes in AzSK until the end of FY21. However, all new security controls and features will be added exclusively to AzTS moving forward. The AzSK project repository will remain available on GitHub beyond FY22 but without active maintenance.

The new solution, AzTS, is available at [https://aka.ms/devopskit/AzTS](https://aka.ms/devopskit/AzTS). Developed by the same team that built AzSK, AzTS has been used to scan nearly 100,000 Azure subscriptions daily for baseline control compliance over the past several months.

As promised to all internal and external users of AzSK, we will continue to share CSEO's internal approach for cloud security and compliance, as well as our migration path towards using native Azure security capabilities. We believe AzTS represents a significant step in this direction. If you have a dependency on AzSK, we recommend migrating to AzTS or adopting an approach based on native capabilities such as Azure Policy, Management Groups, and Security Center.

## About Our Other Scan Modules (AAD, ADO, etc.)

The points above pertain specifically to the Azure-specific AzSK module. For the other modules (AAD scanner, ADO scanner), we provide the following guidance:

- **ADO Scanner Module (AzSK.ADO):** This module will continue to be updated and maintained by our team. It is actively used to surface security risks and remediate issues in our development environments. You can directly access the ADO Scanner project at [https://aka.ms/adoscanner](https://aka.ms/adoscanner).
  
- **AAD Scanner (AzSK.AAD):** This module has been in preview mode. No further development is planned at this time.

## A Note of Thanks

From the beginning, we have treated AzSK as a community effort. Early adopters and users (both from within and outside Microsoft) regularly suggested improvements, whether through overview discussions, targeted use case/solutioning efforts, or even just via email. Almost every appealing feature added to AzSK after its initial launch was influenced by someone outside our core team. The toolkit matured and came a long way because of contributions from collaborators like you. We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude for your inputs, ideas, and contributions, and, equally importantly, for the confidence you placed in us throughout this journey.
