## Abstract
This online book provides a structured, introductory approach to the fundamental concepts and principles of the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) protocol suite. It covers the functioning and basic configuration of the most important protocols in the Microsoft® Windows Vista™, Windows Server® 2008, Windows® XP, and Windows Server 2003 families of operating systems. The book primarily focuses on the conceptual foundation of the TCP/IP protocol suite and includes an integrated discussion of both Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6).
