### Figure 4: Running Time of the Verify Algorithm (Rall = 5,000,000)

The revocation check in our scheme requires \(O(R_{\text{pre}})\) pairing computations. Consequently, the running time of the Verify algorithm is linearly dependent on \(R_{\text{pre}}\). However, it is reasonable to assume that natural revocations account for most signer revocations in practice, with prematurely revoked signers being a small fraction. Therefore, for a relatively small revocation rate, our scheme remains efficient in practical scenarios.

In previous schemes [20, 37], no pairing computations were required for the revocation check; instead, only \(O(R_{\text{pre}})\)-times exponentiations were needed. This makes our revocation check less efficient compared to those schemes. However, this inefficiency is offset by the additional security feature of backward unlinkability provided by our scheme.

### Figure 5: Running Time of the Verify Algorithm for Different Revocation Rates and Total Revoked Signers

### Conclusion

In this paper, we revisit the definition of GS-TBK given in [20, 37] and propose a new security model that considers the unforgeability of the expiry time of signing keys. Our signing algorithm has a constant computational cost, whereas previous schemes' costs depend on the bit-length of the time representation. We also provide implementations.

Both our GS-TBK scheme and previous schemes are secure in the random oracle model. Since we employ the Ohara et al. revocable group signature scheme, which implements the Libert-Peters-Yung revocable group signature scheme [33] in the random oracle model, we might be able to use the Libert-Peters-Yung scheme for implementing time-bound keys. Additionally, as mentioned by Libert and Vergnaud [35], the Nakanishi-Funabiki revocation technique [42] itself does not depend on random oracles. Thus, a GS-TBK scheme in the standard model might be constructed by combining the Libert-Peters-Yung and Nakanishi-Funabiki schemes. Although this is theoretically interesting, there are concerns about the efficiency of such a scheme, as signatures from the Libert-Peters-Yung scheme contain about 100 group elements, making practical efficiency challenging. Therefore, we focus on achieving practical efficiency in this paper and leave the standard model construction as future work.

Future work includes constructing a standard model version of the GS-TBK scheme and exploring ways to remove pairing computations from the revocation check, such as using techniques from [15].
