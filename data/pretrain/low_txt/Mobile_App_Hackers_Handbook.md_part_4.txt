### Protocols and Session Token Vulnerabilities
Protocols such as HTTP or SOAP introduce risks that can expose session tokens to adversaries. This risk overlaps with the concepts outlined in "A2 – Broken Authentication and Session Management" in the OWASP Top 10 web application security risks.

### M10: Lack of Binary Protections
This risk addresses the defensive measures developers can and, in many cases, should implement in mobile applications. Binary protections aim to slow down adversaries attempting to analyze, reverse-engineer, or modify an application’s binary code.

The OWASP Top 10 project is a valuable resource for raising awareness about common vulnerabilities in mobile applications. As mobile application security continues to evolve, the Top 10 project will likely expand to cover new threats, playing an increasingly important role in educating developers and security professionals.

### OWASP Mobile Security Tools
Tools are essential for any security professional, whether for supplementing manual assessments, providing a framework for other tools, or offering remedial or hardening advice for developers. The OWASP Mobile Security Project has developed several open-source security tools:

- **iMAS (iOS Mobile Application Security Project)**: Created by the MITRE Corporation, iMAS is an open-source secure application framework for iOS. It provides resources for developers and security professionals to understand and implement security controls beyond Apple's provided security model. The project covers areas such as in-application passcodes, jailbreak detection, debugging protection, and runtime validation.

- **GoatDroid**: Developed by Jack Mannino and Ken Johnson, GoatDroid is a self-contained training environment for Android applications. It includes two sample implementations, FourGoats (a location-based social network) and Herd Financial (a fictional mobile banking application), which cover most of the OWASP Top 10 Mobile Risks.

- **iGoat**: Similar to GoatDroid, iGoat is a training application for iOS. Developed by Ken van Wyk, Jonathan Carter, and Sean Eidermiller, it provides both a server and client application with exercises on topics such as local storage, keychain, and SQL injection.

- **Damn Vulnerable iOS (DVIA)**: Created by Prateek Gianchandani, DVIA offers a vulnerable iOS application for training. It complements iGoat by covering additional topics like jailbreak detection, runtime manipulation, patching, and cryptography.

- **MobiSec**: A live environment for penetration testing mobile applications, created by Tony DeLaGrange and Kevin Johnson. MobiSec hosts and maintains the latest versions of various tools needed for mobile application assessments, similar to Kali Linux but focused on mobile security.

- **Androick**: This project, created by Florian Pradines, automates forensic analysis tasks for Android applications. It retrieves key forensic artifacts such as APKs, application data, databases, and logs from the device.

These OWASP projects are particularly useful for self-learning due to their well-documented, open-source nature and specific focus on the Top 10 Mobile Risks.

### The Future of Mobile Application Security
The rapid adoption of smartphones and mobile applications over the past five years shows no signs of slowing. This trend will place greater emphasis on understanding and addressing the security threats faced by mobile deployments. Current threats, such as insecure data storage and insufficient transport security, are not well understood, especially in development communities, and are expected to remain prevalent.

Advances in mobile technologies, including new hardware components like fingerprint sensors and increased use of NFC, will lead to the discovery of new vulnerabilities, particularly in environments like mobile payment processing (e.g., Google Wallet and Apple Pay). Criminals will continue to exploit these vulnerabilities for financial gain, leading to an increase in banking malware and premium-rate SMS fraud.

To counter these threats, some developers are employing binary protections and two-factor authentication. The evolution of cross-platform mobile applications, such as browser-based and hybrid applications, also introduces new vulnerabilities. These trends have brought new attacks and variations on existing ones, which we will examine in Chapter 18.

Despite these changes, classic attacks remain a significant concern. Raising awareness through documentation, classification, and demonstrations, such as those by OWASP, is a positive step toward improving mobile security.

### Summary
The surge in third-party application development, driven by the popularity of modern smartphones, has led to feature-rich applications integrating multiple online technologies. However, this has also exposed several unique vulnerabilities that are often not well understood by developers. Research indicates that most applications are vulnerable to attack, and the evolution of new technologies will likely produce entirely new threats.

### Chapter 2: Analyzing iOS Applications
Apple’s iOS, used by iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch devices, is one of the most popular mobile operating systems. With over one million applications in the App Store, the attack surface is significant. This chapter introduces the iOS platform and ecosystem, providing practical steps for building a testing environment and analyzing iOS applications.

#### Understanding the Security Model
Before delving into iOS application vulnerabilities, it is crucial to understand the fundamental security features of the iOS platform:

- **Secure Boot Chain**: Ensures the integrity of the firmware during boot.
- **Code Signing**: Prevents unauthorized applications from running by validating signatures.
- **Process-Level Sandboxing**: Isolates applications from each other and the OS.
- **Data-at-Rest Encryption**: Encrypts all data on the filesystem.
- **Exploit Mitigation Features**: Includes ASLR, non-executable memory, and stack-smashing protection.

#### Initializing iOS with Secure Boot Chain
The Secure Boot Chain initializes and loads the firmware on iOS devices, verifying each component's signature to ensure integrity. The boot ROM, LLB, and iBoot are key components in this process.

#### Introducing the Secure Enclave
The Secure Enclave, found in A7 and A8 chip devices, handles cryptographic operations and key management independently from the main processor, enhancing security even if the kernel is compromised.

#### Restricting Application Processes with Code Signing
Code signing ensures that only trusted applications run on the device by validating signatures. Developers must sign their applications with a trusted certificate, and Apple reviews and signs production applications.

#### Isolating Applications with Process-Level Sandboxing
All third-party applications run in a sandbox, limiting their access to the filesystem and network. This enhances security and limits the damage potential malware can cause.

#### Protecting Information with Data-at-Rest Encryption
Data on the iOS filesystem is encrypted using AES, and the Data Protection API further encrypts individual files and keychain items, making them inaccessible when the device is locked.

#### Protecting Against Attacks with Exploit Mitigation Features
iOS employs modern exploit mitigation technologies, such as non-executable memory, ASLR, and stack-smashing protection, to increase the complexity of attacks.

#### Understanding iOS Applications
iOS applications can be categorized into three main groups:

- **Standard Native Applications**: Developed in Objective-C or Swift.
- **Browser-Based Applications**: Mobile-friendly clones of web applications.
- **Hybrid Applications**: Native wrappers for webviews, often using frameworks to access native functionality.

Knowledge of these languages and their principles is beneficial for understanding and analyzing iOS applications.
