**Current Behavior:**
When a checkbox is included in a form with the `required` attribute, and the checkbox is unchecked, the form validation still passes. As a result, the submit button remains enabled even when the required checkbox is not checked.

Example:
- The form contains a checkbox with the label "Please accept the terms and conditions."
- The submit button is always enabled, regardless of whether the checkbox is checked or not.
- All this code is wrapped inside a `<form>` tag.

**Expected Behavior:**
If a form input (such as a checkbox) is marked as `required`, the form validation should fail if the checkbox is unchecked. Consequently, the submit button should be disabled until the required checkbox is checked.

**Minimal Reproduction of the Problem with Instructions:**
I have been able to reproduce this behavior on Plunker. You can view the example here:

**Motivation / Use Case for Changing the Behavior:**
This issue is particularly relevant in scenarios where the user must accept terms and conditions before proceeding. For example, the user should be required to check the terms and conditions checkbox, and the form should not be submitted until this condition is met.

**Environment:**
- **Operating System:** El Capitan, MacOS
- **IDE/Editor:** Atom
- **Build Tools:** NPM, Browser Sync
- **Angular Version:** 2.0.X (Tried on 2.1)
- **Browsers:** Chrome 53 (but likely the same in other browsers)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Node.js (for AoT issues):** v5.2.0
