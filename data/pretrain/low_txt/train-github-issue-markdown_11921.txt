I absolutely love Atom, but I do have one significant concern. In my project, files are compiled into the "public/" folder. Since this folder is not included in the .gitignore file, it appears in my search results whenever I look for something within the project. This can be quite frustrating, as I never need to see results from this particular folder.

It would be ideal if there was an option to exclude specific file types or folders from search results, particularly if this feature could be configured through the "Project Settings." 

Thank you, team! You all are doing a fantastic job!
