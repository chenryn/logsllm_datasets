### Evaluation and Assumptions

Our evaluation has carefully addressed exceptions, such as clients occasionally being directed to distant frontends. If we accept these assumptions, our maps allow us to leverage Google’s understanding of network topology and user placement to improve other datasets. Prior work has used Akamai to choose detour routes [31]; we believe our mapping can enhance geolocation, peer selection, and AS classification.

### Geolocation

Geolocation is a well-studied problem [11, 10, 14], and the availability of ground truth data can significantly improve results. With clients accessing Google from mobile devices and computers around the world, Google has access to extensive data and measurement opportunities to gather highly accurate client locations. An interesting future direction is to infer prefix locations from our EDNS-client-subnet observations and use this coarse data to re-evaluate prefixes that existing datasets (such as MaxMind) place in very different locations. The end result would be either higher accuracy geolocation or, at least, identification of prefixes with uncertain locations.

### Peer Selection

Researchers designed a BitTorrent plugin that directs a client to peer with other users deemed to be nearby because they received similar CDN redirections [7]. However, the current plugin only allows the client to assess the similarity of other plugin users who send their CDN frontend mappings. By using EDNS-client-subnet to obtain mappings from arbitrary prefixes around the world, we could design a modified version of the plugin that would allow a client to assess the proximity of any potential peer, regardless of whether the peer uses the plugin. Removing this barrier would make the modified plugin more widely applicable and could enhance the adoption of such plugins.

### AS Classification

In Section 6.2, we showed that 90% of prefixes served in ASes other than Google are within the customer cone of their serving AS. The remaining 10% of prefixes likely represent issues with either our IP-to-AS mapping [13] or with the customer cone dataset we used [18]. Discussions with the researchers behind this work and sharing our results suggest that it may be necessary to move to prefix-level cones to accommodate the complex relationships between ASes on the Internet. The client-to-frontend data we generate could help resolve ambiguities in AS relationships and lead to better inference in the future.

### Calibrating Other Measurements

Our studies of Google combine observations using EDNS-client-subnet and open recursive resolvers. Not all providers support EDNS-client-subnet, however. In Section 5.1, we demonstrated that even using hundreds of thousands of open recursive DNS resolvers would miss much of Google’s infrastructure that we uncover using EDNS-client-subnet. We next consider how we can use our results from Google to project results for other providers that support only open resolvers.

To explore the feasibility of this projection, Figure 12 depicts the number of Google IP addresses discovered as we issue additional measurements. We select one open recursive resolver from each /24 in which we know of at least one resolver (there are 110,000 such prefixes). Then, we select one of these /24s at a time and resolve www.google.com from the open resolver in the prefix and via an EDNS-client-subnet query for that prefix. The figure shows the growth in the number of Google frontend IP addresses discovered by the two approaches (min, mean, and max over 1000 trials). As seen in the figure, using resolvers in a set of prefixes yields very similar numbers of frontend IPs to issuing EDNS-client-subnet queries for the same set of prefixes, so the benefit of EDNS-client-subnet is primarily that we can issue queries for many more prefixes than we have access to resolvers in.

This suggests that we may be able to extrapolate these growth curves to understand the impact of having more resolvers. To test this theory, we fit power law curves to the open resolver lines (R = 0.97 in all cases). We project that access to resolvers in all 10M routable /24 prefixes would predict the discovery of 6990–8687 IP addresses of Google frontend servers. Using EDNS-client-subnet queries for these 10M prefixes, we found 8563 IP addresses, within the range, suggesting that the extrapolation approach may be reasonable. In the future, we plan to apply it to predict the size of Akamai and other infrastructures that do not yet support EDNS-client-subnet.

### Conclusions

As the role of interactive web applications continues to grow in our lives, and the mobile web penetrates remote regions of the world more than wired networks ever had, the Internet needs to deliver fast performance to everyone, everywhere, at all times. To serve clients around the world quickly, service providers deploy globally distributed serving infrastructure, and we must understand these infrastructures to understand how providers deliver content today. Towards that goal, we developed approaches specific to mapping these serving infrastructures. By basing our techniques on how providers architect their infrastructures and guarding against noisy data, we are able to accurately map the geographically-distributed serving sites.

We applied our techniques to mapping Google’s serving infrastructure and tracked its rapid expansion over the period of our measurement study. During that time, the number of serving sites doubled, and we observed Google deploying satellite frontends around the world, often distant from known Google datacenters. By continuing to map Google’s and others’ serving infrastructures, we will watch the evolution of these key enablers of today’s Internet, and we expect the accurate maps to enable future work by us and others to understand and improve content delivery on a global scale.
