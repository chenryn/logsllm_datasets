I am here as a private citizen and do not represent my employer. All material presented has been in the public domain at one time or another. I will answer historical questions about John Wiegand and the access control industry but will not address technical or other questions about my employer’s or any other vendor’s products.

**Card Technology Timeline**

**The “First” RFID Tag**
- Steven Shepard claims Mario Cardullo invented the first RFID tag*.
- After a spring 1969 airplane ride next to an IBM engineer, Cardullo sketched out the idea for the first RFID-like tag with dynamic memory.
- Patent issued on January 23, 1973.

**Transponder Apparatus & System**
- Priority Date: May 21, 1970
- There were earlier patents for RFID Interrogator/Transponder ID Systems, such as US Patent 3,299,424, with a priority date of May 5, 1965.
- These earlier patents did not use digital memory; they were analog.
- Cardullo’s first prototypes used core memory to store 16 bits of data.

**But Earlier RFID Patents Exist**
- **Interrogator-Responder System**
  - Priority Date: May 5, 1965

**Introducing the Musician with Perfect Pitch - John R. Wiegand**
- Though he could have been a world-famous symphony conductor, history remembers him as the inventor of the “Wiegand-Effect.”
- He also invented a digital read/write Prox RFID system before anyone else.
- As Paul Harvey would say, “Now, the rest of the story.”

**Interceptor Xmfr Prox Key**
- Priority Date: December 17, 1965
- Uses described in patent background – sound familiar?

**Interceptor Xmfr Proximity Key Patent Drawings**

**Quote**
- “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” - Arthur C. Clarke, "Profiles of The Future", 1961

**ADT Declined**
- Milton Velinsky, John’s business partner, mentioned that ADT dismissed John’s Prox invention as a magician’s trick and doubted its viability.
- John’s Prox invention, though never commercialized, was ahead of its time.
  - It used near-field communications at 4.8 kHz.
  - Data was stored on the wire, similar to bubble memory.
  - It was passive, drawing power from the interrogator, but could use a battery for longer communications.

**John Wiegand Biography**
- John was a musician by training, born in Germany in 1912.
- He came to the US in the 1930s and studied at the Juilliard School of Music in New York.
- While at Juilliard, he became interested in audio amplifiers and later worked as an engineering assistant for magnetic amplifiers at Bell Telephone Laboratory.
- In 1944, he joined Sperry Gyroscope Company and later worked for a government contractor developing tape recorders.
- In 1965, he began his research on magnetic materials, leading to the Wiegand effect.
- His perfect pitch allowed him to listen to magnetic pulses through a loudspeaker before he had an oscilloscope.
- He and Milton Velinsky formed Wiegand Electronics to develop applications for the Wiegand Effect.

**The Wiegand Protocol**
- Wiegand wires moving past a read head generate pulses, forming the Wiegand Protocol.

**Hacking Wiegand Cards & the Wiegand Protocol**
- In 1992, Bill Payne, an employee of Sandia Labs, exposed the wires using Magnaview film and a cow magnet.
- At DEFCON 13, Zamboni described a theoretical attack called “Wiegand Injection.”
- At DEFCON 15, Zac Franken demonstrated a Wiegand Protocol replay device called GECKO.

**Wrap Up**
- Since 1978, I owe my livelihood to the electronic physical access control industry.
- John’s Wiegand Card Readers laid the foundation for this industry.
- The Wiegand protocol is still widely used in access control readers.
- I once met John in his lab in Valley Stream, NY.

**Dedication**
- I will post fascinating material at www.wiegand-effect.com.
- Dr. Scott Guthery inspired me to write a book on the subject, but it is still in the data-gathering phase.
- If DEFCON allows, I hope to share more about John and his wonderful wires, including demos and the physics behind the Wiegand Effect.
