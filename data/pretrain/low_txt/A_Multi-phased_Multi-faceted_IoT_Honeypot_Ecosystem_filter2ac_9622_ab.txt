### Analyzing Attacker IP Addresses and Captured Malicious Files

To analyze attacker IP addresses and captured malicious files, we utilize the following resources:
- [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/)
- [DShield](https://www.dshield.org/)
- [AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com/)

### Multi-Faceted and Multi-Phased Deployment

As discussed in Section 1, different IoT devices have varying specifications and configurations. Therefore, each honeypot must be uniquely designed and configured. We adopted a multi-faceted and multi-phased approach to building our honeypot instances.

#### Multi-Phased Approach
1. **Initial Deployment and Data Collection:**
   - In the first phase, we deployed the honeypots and collected data.
   
2. **Data Analysis and Behavior Elicitation:**
   - In the second phase, we analyzed the captured data to understand what information cybercriminals were seeking. We then provided appropriate responses to elicit further adversary behaviors. This phase iterates until we are satisfied with the insights gained.

3. **Advanced Honeypot Deployment:**
   - In the third phase, we used the insights from previous phases to deploy more advanced honeypots. This multi-phased investigation complements our multi-faceted honeypot approach.

#### Multi-Faceted Honeypot Design
We have designed three facets in our ecosystem:
1. **HoneyShell:**
   - We utilized off-the-shelf Cowrie honeypots to emulate vulnerable IoT devices with open SSH (port 22) or Telnet (port 23). By gradually increasing the sophistication of login credentials based on previous logs, we were able to capture more complex and voluminous commands, providing deeper insights into attackers.

2. **HoneyWindowsBox:**
   - For emulating IoT devices based on the Windows platform, we chose Dionaea and KFSensor.

3. **HoneyCamera:**
   - We developed a specific honeypot from scratch to emulate the behavior of an IoT camera device. 
     - **ProxyPot:** A proxy instance that sits between an IoT device and the network gateway, capturing all traffic.
     - **HoneyCamera:** A low-interaction honeypot for D-Link IoT cameras. In Phase 1, three honeypots were deployed: two emulating D-Link DCS-5020L and one imitating D-Link DCS-5030L. In Phase 2, based on the logs from Phase 1, multiple two-step attacks were designed. One such attack involved exploiting a well-known vulnerability to read usernames and passwords, followed by a login attempt using the stolen credentials.

### Related Work

- **Luo et al.** [9] designed an "intelligent-interaction" honeypot for IoT devices, which actively scanned other IoT devices and sent part of received attacks to them to elicit legitimate responses. Our approach ensures that all attack traffic is forwarded to devices under our control, preventing unintended victimization.
- **Wang et al.** [10] presented IoTCMal, a hybrid IoT honeypot framework with both low-interaction and high-interaction components for collecting and analyzing malware samples.
- **Feng et al.** [11] used a honeypot system with real devices and simulated services to collect real-world attack traffic and create attack signatures for automated protection.
- **Vetterl et al.** [12] used firmware images to emulate CPE/IoT devices and run them as honeypots.
- Several studies [13–18] have utilized low-interaction and high-interaction honeypots to study attacks on IoT devices. Our main contribution is the design, implementation, and deployment of a multi-phased, multi-faceted honeypot ecosystem that effectively captures useful attack data and studies evolving adversary behaviors.

### Conclusion

In this work, we present a multi-faceted and multi-phased approach to building an IoT honeypot ecosystem. An evolving honeypot ecosystem can attract more interesting and valuable attacks compared to a static, short-term deployment. Our approach is particularly effective in capturing human attack activities, not just automated scripts.
