### 5.2 Cross-Linking
Next, we examine the characteristics of the cross-linking approach used by the SEO campaign to poison search results. "Link juice" is a term in SEO that refers to the number of backlinks received from other unique websites, a well-known feature used by search algorithms for ranking web pages. Consequently, one of the primary requirements for an effective SEO campaign to poison search results is to artificially accumulate this link juice. By understanding the campaign’s cross-linking strategy, we can better counteract search result poisoning.

The SEO botnet employs a link farming technique where, using the terminology from [7], a small subset of compromised websites emulates authoritative sites and receives substantially more link juice than the other sites, which act as hubs. This relationship persists over an extended period and ends when the botmaster rotates the authority sites. A different subset of compromised sites then becomes the new authorities, receiving the dominant fraction of link juice, while the previous authorities become hubs. Link farming benefits the botmaster in two key ways:
1. **Traffic Concentration**: There is a non-linear relationship between search result position and the amount of traffic clicking through the search result. The botmaster can attract more traffic by focusing on having the authority sites occupy a few top search result positions rather than many lower positions.
2. **Risk Mitigation**: By selectively "juicing" a relatively small subset of authorities, the botmaster can limit the number of sites lost due to interventions by site owners or defense mechanisms like Google Safe Browsing.

In our study, we identified two major authority rotations by monitoring substantial changes in the amount of link juice received by sites from the botnet. Both rotations coincide with significant changes in the botnet:
- The first rotation occurred on November 1, 2011, when the SEO kit was updated from OEM to MAC.
- The second rotation occurred on January 28, 2012, following an outage of the botnet directory server (Section 5.1.1).

Table 3 summarizes the distribution of link juice among compromised nodes in the botnet. It shows the number of compromised sites grouped by the order of magnitude of the average daily backlinks received during each time period. For example, from the start of the study to November 1, 2011, there were 532 nodes receiving less than ten backlinks, 71 nodes receiving 10–100 backlinks, and 12 nodes receiving 100–1000 backlinks. Each time range exhibits a consistent pattern: a small subset of sites (authorities) receive hundreds of backlinks, tens of sites receive tens of backlinks, and the remaining hubs receive fewer than ten backlinks. We confirmed that the roles of compromised sites indeed changed from one period to another. For instance, in the November 2011 rotation, over 80 nodes had their link juice reduced by at least an order of magnitude, while 20 nodes saw an increase of at least an order of magnitude.

The top sites receiving the most link juice are the most valuable to the botmaster, as they have the highest exposure in search results and attract the most traffic. However, these sites are also the most vulnerable. To undermine SEO botnets, targeting these high-juice sites first, such as through blacklists like Google Safe Browsing, will be most effective.

As noted in Section 3, the release of V8 introduces a new cross-linking mechanism that uses blogspot blogs as an extra layer of redirection. We do not directly compare the amount of link juice observed using this new mechanism with the botmaster’s previous approach because there are only two posts per blog, the last of which occurred in early April. Since this strategy involves sporadic large batches of link juice rather than periodic increments, we focus the V8 cross-linking analysis on data after March 6, 2012. Similar to the previous link farming strategy, we see a similar distribution of sites emulating authorities (63) and hubs (665), albeit with a larger number of middle-sized hubs (251), as shown in Table 4.

### 5.3 SEO Effectiveness
Using earlier data from the Dagger cloaking crawler, we next examine the ability of the SEO botnet to poison search results in Google. These poisoned search results serve as doorways, redirecting users who click through the search result to a destination chosen by the botmaster. Thus, the doorways accumulate traffic for the botmaster to monetize. We assess the potential threat posed by the SEO botnet by measuring the poisoned search results from the user's perspective.

We find that the botnet can be highly effective in bursts, with thousands of poisoned search results targeting popular and trending search terms at any given time during the burst. At its peak, it is the dominant contributor to poisoned search results in Google from April through June 2011. The botnet can juice specific search terms with poisoned search results within 24 hours, whereas it takes Google over 48 hours to start counteracting the poisoning.

**Figure 5: Quantity of Poisoned Search Results**
Each line in Figure 5 shows the number of poisoned search results that are redirecting users, dormant, or tagged by Google Safe Browsing.

#### 5.3.1 Quantity
The ultimate goal of the SEO botnet is to attract user traffic to its compromised sites by manipulating search results. We first evaluate the effectiveness of the SEO botnet in achieving this goal by analyzing the placement of its sites in search results.

Using the set of compromised sites enumerated by the host crawler, we identify the botnet’s poisoned search results using the URLs that link to a compromised site. We then categorize each poisoned search result into one of three states over time: active, tagged, or dormant.
- **Active** poisoned search results are cloaking and actively redirecting users to unexpected sites, such as fake antivirus (AV) pages, to monetize their clicks.
- **Tagged** results have been labeled as malicious by Google Safe Browsing (GSB), presumably discouraging users from visiting and preventing the botmaster from significantly monetizing traffic to these URLs. GSB blacklists URLs that lead to phishing and malware pages. Although not all pages the botnet uses to monetize traffic may fall under GSB’s purview, when GSB labels those pages, it is a useful indicator of defenses undermining the botmaster’s SEO campaign.
- **Dormant** poisoned search results are cloaking but not redirecting. These search results lead to sites that apparently have redirection disabled, and the botmaster no longer derives value from them.

**Figure 5** shows the evolution of an SEO campaign over time, as viewed by the prevalence of various kinds of poisoned search results. Over six months, we observed four main periods of activity:
- **Starting Period (April 1st to April 18th)**: Most poisoned search results were tagged, yet the volume of active results remained high. On April 15th, for example, we observed 2,807 poisoned search results, of which 1,702 were tagged, 721 were active, and 384 were dormant. The tagged and dormant search results are remnants of the previous SEO campaign, while the growing number of active results reflects the increasing momentum of a new campaign.
- **Surge Period (April 18th to April 28th)**: A surge in active poisoned search results corresponds with a decline in tagged results. This surge reflects the campaign promoting a new set of heavily "juiced" hub sites (Section 5.2). This 10-day window shows the botnet SEO campaign at its peak, with most poisoned search results actively monetizing traffic before Google Safe Browsing and site owners can react.
- **Steady Period (April 28th to June 30th)**: There is a substantial decrease in active poisoned results and a corresponding increase in tagged and dormant results. These results are no longer effective for the botmaster since they have either been flagged by GSB to warn away users or the sites have been sanitized by their owners.
- **Idle Period (After June)**: The total volume of poisoned search results declines substantially, coinciding with the timeframe of an organized intervention into the fake AV industry by the FBI [8]. From July through October 2011, the SEO campaign had results linked to compromised sites that remain tagged or dormant, but only a negligible number of sites were actively redirecting. This highlights the successful impact of interventions that undermine the vector by which the botmaster could monetize traffic, like the fake AV takedown. Undermining monetization removes the key incentive for the botmaster to keep SEO campaigns active.

#### 5.3.2 Temporal Analysis
While Section 5.3.1 assesses the SEO campaign’s activity level over time, quantity alone does not provide a complete picture of the volume and coverage of poisoned search results. For example, on April 23, 2011, Dagger queried “the ten commandments list” and found one poisoned search result from this SEO campaign. Sixteen hours later, Dagger re-queried the same term and found 20 poisoned search results. We suspect the increase in poisoned search results is due to the increased time available for the campaign to optimize their sites. These dynamics demonstrate the importance of the time component in conveying impact. Thus, to assess the botnet’s potential threat through the volume and coverage of specific search terms, we measure the quantity of poisoned search results for the same query at subsequent points in time.

**Figure 6** presents the number of poisoned search results attributable to the SEO campaign when the same query is repeated for varying time deltas. For each search term, the zero time delta is when Dagger first sees poisoned search results for that search term. We show results separately for the start, surge, and steady periods to highlight differences among them.

Each graph contains two lines:
- **POISONED Line**: Represents the number of poisoned search results that have not been labeled by Google Safe Browsing, averaged across the entire dataset. We use the same methodology as above, except here we apply it to the additional temporal data and do not distinguish between active and dormant poisoned search results.
- **LABELED Line**: Represents the average number of poisoned search results that have been labeled by GSB. As expected, we see the same results as before. The start period has a mixture of poisoned and labeled search results from a previous SEO campaign. Then there is a burst of poisoned search results during the surge period, and a steady stream of poisoned search results in the steady period.

The number of poisoned search results from their first appearance in a query for a search term is just the tip of the iceberg. Within hours of the initial appearance, users are likely to encounter a flood of poisoned search results. This is most prominent during the surge period, where the number of poisoned search results seen increases nearly 3× from 374 to 1,089 within 24 hours. In the start period, we see an increase from 38 to 218 within 24 hours, and in the steady period, we see an increase from 286 to 482 within 24 hours. Further, at the start of a new campaign, GSB lags behind the increase in poisoned search results, with the POISONED lines showing a higher slope than the LABELED lines during the surge and steady periods. Only when the campaign enters the start period does GSB begin to react swiftly to the later-arriving poisoned search results (the dip after 48 hours in the POISONED line).

#### 5.3.3 Market Share
Intersecting the data from the botnet crawler and the search crawler allows us to compare the relative size of this SEO campaign against all other similar SEO campaigns in terms of the volume of poisoned search results. **Figure 7** shows the number of cloaked search results over time found by Dagger, and then the subset attributed to just this SEO campaign. During the surge period, this campaign accounted for the majority of cloaked search results at 58%. This campaign was most prominent on April 24th, when 3,041 out of 4,426 (69%) poisoned search results came from this single campaign. Even as the surge decreased in the steady period, the SEO campaign still accounted for 17% of all active poisoned search results observed. As a result, not only is this SEO campaign one of the main contributors of poisoned search results, but it has also demonstrated the potential to poison more search results than all other competing SEO campaigns combined for an extended duration of 10 days.

#### 5.3.4 Active SEO Duration
Similar to Section 5.1.2, we next quantify how long the botmaster is able to effectively utilize compromised sites as doorways for funneling users to scams. Compared to the lifespan of the botnet, we focus on the active duration, the total amount of time that the site is both exposed to users through poisoned search results and actively redirects them to scams. For each compromised site, we collect all occurrences of poisoned search results observed from April 1 to September 30, 2011. We track whether the poisoned search results were redirecting users and whether they were labeled by GSB. We use the first occurrence of a poisoned search result to a site as the start of the site’s active duration and end it when we do not see another occurrence of a poisoned search result, attributable to this site, within the following three weeks of the last result.

In this six-month period, 3,822 compromised sites from this campaign were involved in poisoning search results. Of these, 2,128 sites (56%) actively redirected users. **Figure 8** shows a binned histogram of the number of sites that poison search results and actively redirect users at a week granularity. A majority of actively redirecting sites (56%) have durations of less than a week. Of the remaining 937 sites that effectively poison search results and redirect users for longer than a week, most (89%) survive 1–6 weeks.

### 5.4 Monetization
Ultimately, the botmaster operates and maintains the GR botnet to make money. Compromising sites, cloaking and traffic segmentation, cross-linking, and poisoning search engine results are all components of a black hat SEO machine engineered to generate profit.
