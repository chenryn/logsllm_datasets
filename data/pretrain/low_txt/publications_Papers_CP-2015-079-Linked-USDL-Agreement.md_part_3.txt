### 4. Performance Credit and Qualifying Conditions

- **Performance Credit:**
  - If the Percentage Uptime is equal to or less than 99.98%, the Subscriber is entitled to a Performance Credit of 10% of the Services Fees for each full 1% reduction in Percentage Uptime.
  - The obliged party can be modeled for each Agreement Term using liability roles via the `hasEntityLiability` property.

- **Qualifying Conditions:**
  - Qualifying conditions are expressed using the `hasPrecondition` property.
  - The assessment schedule of an SLO (Service Level Objective) is specified with the `hasEvaluationInterval` property.
  - Validity periods are expressed using the `hasValidityInterval` property for each Agreement Term.
  - Both penalties and rewards can be expressed at the level of SLOs using the `hasCompensation` property.
  - The validity period of the entire SLA (Service Level Agreement) can be expressed using the `validThrough` property of a Service Offering included in the Linked USDL Core.

### Contract Structure

Contracts typically consist of two main parts:

1. **Agreement:**
   - Describes the general terms of the contract using natural language without any underlying structure.

2 - **Exhibits:**
   - Provide a structured description, still in natural language, about the specific terms of the contract.
   - The part that has been successfully modeled is "Exhibit A" of the contract under analysis.

Further research and solutions are required to model the part of the contract agreement due to the complexity of the language used, as demonstrated in the following text box:

- **Agreement Section:**
  - **2.2 Service Level Reporting:**
    - On a monthly basis, in arrears, and no later than the fifteenth (15th) calendar day of the subsequent month following the reporting month, the Service Provider shall provide reports to the Subscriber describing the performance of the Services and of the Service Provider compared to the Service Level Standards.
    - The Subscriber Satisfaction Survey Service Level shall be conducted by the Service Provider each year on the anniversary of the Effective Date, and the results shall be reported to the Subscriber no later than the fifteenth (15th) calendar day of the subsequent month following such anniversary date.

### Criteria Not Supported by Linked USDL Agreement

- **Composability:**
  - Not supported because most SLAs are not for composite services; they are expressed for the resulting composition exposed as a single service.
- **Alternative Service Levels:**
  - Not supported since most SLAs define just one service level.
- **Soft Constraints:**
  - Not supported as most SLOs are expressed as hard constraints.
- **Negotiation-Related Criteria:**
  - Not supported as most SLAs are take-it-or-leave-it offers without any possible negotiation.
- **Recovery Actions and Settlement Actions:**
  - Not supported as only penalties are usually defined in SLAs.

These criteria are fulfilled by fewer proposals, with no more than two different proposals fulfilling each, except for recovery actions, which are supported by four proposals. This reinforces the belief that these features are useful in a very limited set of scenarios.

### Tooling Support

- **Linked USDL Agreement Tool:**
  - Writing an SLA in Linked USDL Agreement can be challenging and prone to errors.
  - The tool provides support for defining and consistency checking of SLAs.
  - It includes an analysis module that detects problems in SLA documents using constraint programming.
  - The tool performs a validity check, including the detection of dead guarantees and inconsistent terms.
  - It also provides an analysis report answering the different competency questions presented in Section III using SPARQL queries.

### Conclusions and Future Work

- **Conclusions:**
  - Existing specifications for creating agreements for services, such as WS–Agreements, WSLA, and SLA*, were developed to capture technical aspects of Web services.
  - Linked USDL Agreement was developed to capture business aspects, compensations, and time constraints.
  - The evaluation of Linked USDL Agreement showed its capabilities to model services like EC2 made available by Amazon AWS and cover the SLA lifecycle compared to existing ones.

- **Future Work:**
  - Build a proof-of-concept prototype to illustrate how a service marketplace could automatically provision services to consumers based on their requirements and preferences.
  - Establish contracting using Linked USDL Agreement and automatically detect SLO violations, which would be reported to customers and trigger compensation actions.
