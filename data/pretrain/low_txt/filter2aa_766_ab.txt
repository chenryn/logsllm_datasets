### Volatile Data Analysis

#### Event Logs
- **User Activity:**
  - Who is logged in
  - What actions have they performed
  - From which location
  - Familiarize yourself with event log numbers or know where to find this information

#### Registry
- **Detailed Log File:**
  - User activity (ntuser.dat)
    - How and from where (identify relevant registry keys)
    - LastWrite times
- **Extraction and Parsing:**
  - Can be extracted from a live system
  - Use tools like RegRipper or RipXP for parsing

#### Restore Points (Shadow Copy Volumes)
- **System Changes:**
  - Record major changes to the system chronologically
  - Useful for identifying:
    - Malware presence
    - System updates
    - Installed software
    - Registry changes
- **Parsing:**
  - Use RipXP for parsing

#### System Information
- **Key Details:**
  - Operating System
  - Patch level
  - Auditing policies
  - Password policies

#### RAM
- **Critical Data:**
  - Encryption keys
  - Running processes
    - Open handles
    - Mutexes
  - Garbled data
  - Least frequently occurring data
    - DLLs in use
    - Network connections
    - Unpacked binaries
    - Strings
  - Usernames and passwords
  - Regular expressions
  - Luhn checks

### Data Correlation
- **Context and Confidence:**
  - Combine data from multiple sources such as:
    - Various log files (e.g., Dr. Watson, Evt, firewall logs)
    - Restore points (Shadow Volume Copies)
    - Registry (System, Software, NTUSER.dat)
- **Objective Clarity:**
  - Clearly define what you are looking for and the questions you need to answer
  - The data will provide the necessary context; your task is to integrate it

### Timeline Analysis
- **Activity Window:**
  - Provides a window into specific date activities
  - Offers information about specific files, including deleted ones
- **Inclusions:**
  - File system data
  - Registry
  - Log files
- **Tool:**
  - Use Log2Timeline by Kristinn Gudjonsson (http://www.log2timeline.net/)

### Case Studies

#### All Your Registry Entries Are Belong to Us!
- **Binary Wipe:**
  - Binary wiped with sDelete
  - Residual execution evidence in the registry
  - LastWriteTime confirmed the last execution time
  - Dates matched entries in Firewall Logs

#### Timeline Says U R p0wn3d
- **Nefarious Activity:**
  - Timeline showed malicious activity
  - Quickly identified malware, dump file, and exfiltration method
  - Multiple breaches visible in the timeline

#### Don’t Count Your Keylogger B4 It’s Hatched…wait…what???
- **Keylogger Output:**
  - Identified keylogger output file from the timeline
  - Outfile contained IP address and malware
  - Tip: Do not start your keylogger if you still have tools to download

### Example Registry Entries
- **LastWrite Time:**
  - Thu Mar 4 09:18:13 2010 (UTC)
  - MRUList = a
  - a -> C:\WINDOWS\system32\ENT.exe
- **Software Key:**
  - List contents of the Software key in the NTUSER.DAT hive file, ordered by LastWrite time
  - Examples:
    - Thu Mar 4 09:27:49 2010Z ENT2
    - Thu Mar 4 09:18:53 2010Z Far

### Timeline Example
- **Activity:**
  - Tue Mar 23 2010 03:41:47, FTP.EXE-06C55CF9.pf
  - Tue Mar 23 2010 03:42:18, b.exe
  - Tue Mar 23 2010 03:42:18, ssms.exe
  - ... (additional entries)
