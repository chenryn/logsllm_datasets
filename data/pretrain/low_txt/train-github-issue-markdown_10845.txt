## Description
The `task_queue_ha_policy` setting for RabbitMQ no longer has any effect, as noted in the release notes for version 3. This issue was reported to the mailing list in 2013, and the response at that time was that the setting is deprecated and will be removed.

## Suggestions
- Remove the `task_queue_ha_policy` configuration parameter.
- Provide a reference to the blog post and/or documentation on how to set up a policy as an alternative.
