# Table 1: Benchmarking Results for Random Circuits

| Size | Small Modulus (ms) | Large Modulus (ms) |
|------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 239.22 | 10000 | 11053.62 |
| 363.61 | 11498.90 | 134.33 |
| 25757.51 | 25891.84 | - |

**Table 1:** Benchmarking results for random circuits of the indicated size. The small modulus variants used a prime \( q = 2^{61} - 1 \) that fits into a 64-bit word, while the large modulus results used \( q = 2^{255} - 19 \). All times are given in milliseconds. For the prover, we report times for computing the MPC protocol in the head and committing to the views. For the verifier, we report times for verifying the commitments and checking consistency between views. Data was collected using a modest 2.3 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7 with 32 GB RAM, 512 KB L2 cache per core, and 8 MB L3 cache.

## Performance Comparison
The performance of these implementations is competitive with aggressively optimized unverified implementations.

## Related Work
Zero-knowledge (ZK) protocols are a rapidly evolving area within cryptography, with many protocols existing for both specific proof goals and flexible solutions that can be used for any relation. Only a small part of this field has been studied from the perspective of computer-aided cryptography [7]. The work in [8] was the first to formalize a special class of \(\Sigma\)-protocols in CertiCrypt, a predecessor of EasyCrypt implemented as a Coq library, and to prove the security of general and or composability theorems for \(\Sigma\)-protocols. The more recent work in [15] restates many of these results for \(\Sigma\)-protocols in CryptHOL, formalizing abstract and concrete commitment scheme primitives and proving a construction of commitment schemes from \(\Sigma\)-protocols.

The most significant machine-checked endeavor for ZK is the work in [6], which developed a full-stack verified framework for ZK proofs. It includes a non-verified optimizing ZK compiler that translates high-level ZK proof goals into C or Java implementations, and a verified compiler that generates a reference implementation. The machine-checked effort lies in proving that, for any goal, the reference implementation satisfies the ZK properties and that the optimized implementation has the same observable behavior as the reference implementation. The core of the verified compiler builds on the results from [8], extended with and compositions of \(\Sigma\)GSP-protocols, and generates CertiCrypt proof scripts for automatically proving the equivalence of the two implementations.

There is now a vast body of multi-party computation (MPC) protocols and frameworks, some of which have been formally verified using machine-checked tools. CircGen [1] is a verified compiler that translates C programs into Boolean circuits, extending the CompCert C compiler with an additional backend translation to Boolean circuits. This backend can then be used to feed circuits to an EasyCrypt machine-checked implementation of Yao’s 2-party secure function evaluation protocol. The work in [24] formalizes in EasyCrypt the \(n\)-party MPC protocol due to Maurer [27] for the actively secure case. In this paper, we formalize in EasyCrypt the passive case and provide a formally verified Jasmin implementation thereof. The work in [19] develops verified implementations of proactively secure MPC, including an EasyCrypt formalization of BGW [12] for passive and static active adversaries, which we adapt and build on in this paper.

### Independent Work on Verifying MPC-in-the-Head
Recently, independent work [30] presented a machine-checked security proof for a class of \(\Sigma\)-protocols following the approach to MitH introduced by the ZKBoo protocol [20], an important optimized derivative of the MitH paradigm. The authors formalized decomposition protocols and showed how they can be used to construct \(\Sigma\)-protocols, which are secure in the sense of special-soundness and special honest verifier zero-knowledge. These properties are specific to \(\Sigma\)-protocols; indeed, additional transformations and security proofs are needed to obtain the standard non-interactive proof of knowledge (PoK) guarantees that these protocols provide.

The contributions in this paper compared to those in [30] are as follows:
1. We also consider 3-pass ZK protocols but provide both a machine-checked proof of security for MitH and a formally verified implementation. Our implementation of MitH includes verified implementations for the underlying MPC, secret sharing, and commitment sub-protocols and can be used in practice to prove arbitrary goals in ZK.
2. Our formalization follows the original IKOS construction given in [25] and uses the standard syntax and security notions for ZK proofs, MPC protocols, and commitment schemes. This enables us to build on and deploy standard components, but it introduces the challenge of formalizing more complex security proofs. For example, the proof of the (malicious verifier) ZK property is quite challenging when compared to the honest verifier variant because the distribution of the verifier’s challenge is not known a priori and a form of rejection sampling must be used in the simulation. The techniques we use to establish this result allowed us also to formalize the reduction of the soundness error by repetition, and we are currently working to extend this result for the ZK property of the sequential composition construction.
