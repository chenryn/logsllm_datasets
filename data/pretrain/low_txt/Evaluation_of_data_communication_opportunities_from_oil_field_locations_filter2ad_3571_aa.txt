## Abstract
Cellular data links are an effective outdoor Internet access solution in urban environments. This paper evaluates cellular data service as a potential communication solution for oil field crews operating in remote areas in the United States. We first recorded the performance of cellular data service at twelve oil field locations and found extensive availability, making it a viable data communication solution. We then designed a measurement framework and deployed measurement units to five oil field crews to compare two different satellite links and cellular links from two service providers. Analysis of over 300 days of data shows that cellular links have comparable or even higher availability than conventional satellite links in many field operations. However, the quality of coverage is location-dependent, indicating that both cellular and satellite links should be used to provide highly available and cost-effective data communication.

## 1. Introduction
Data communication at oil field locations is essential for operation control, equipment monitoring, and crew coordination. It is also desirable for communication between oil field locations and applications on the Internet or within an enterprise network infrastructure. For example, important job parameters can be sent to a data server where clients can view job progress and provide feedback. Stricter governmental regulations, such as those introduced after the 2010 Macondo well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico, have introduced new data communication requirements for field operations, such as regular reporting of oilfield equipment status to a data center. Since most field operations are conducted in remote areas, satellite links have been the primary option, but they come with limited bandwidth and high costs. This study evaluates alternative data communication solutions, particularly cellular data services, for field operations to the Internet, including servers within our Schlumberger Information Network (SINet).

Recent research has evaluated outdoor Internet access using 3G cellular service, showing high bandwidth and stable connectivity in urban regions. However, the performance of cellular data links in remote areas, far from cellular towers, has not been thoroughly evaluated. In this paper, we explore the potential for less costly cellular data usage in remote sites where such usage has not traditionally been considered. We provide a framework for assessing the availability of cellular and satellite coverage through systematic measurement and analyze results from different geographical locations.

We first conducted a series of performance measurements of cellular data links at twelve remote operation locations. Based on the analysis of these measurements, we designed a measurement framework and deployed five testing units to field crews to collect performance data of cellular and satellite links over more than 300 days. To our knowledge, this is the first side-by-side comparison between cellular data links and satellite links in remote areas.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes related work, Section 3 introduces our measurement setup and test scenarios, Section 4 presents the analysis of measurement results, and Section 5 concludes with a summary of findings and plans for future work.

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Wireless Communication at Oil Fields
Modern oil field operations, from exploration to production, require significant interactions between software and hardware, as well as collaboration among field personnel. Providing data communication at field locations is not only essential but critical. Wireless technology has been widely adopted because most oil field operations are conducted in locations where wired network infrastructure is impractical. Common wireless equipment includes WLANs and two-way radios. The correlation between transfer delay and TCP packet size over GPRS links has been studied for real-time oil field monitoring.

### 2.2 Outdoor Internet Access
Studies of outdoor data access mainly focus on connectivity from moving vehicles, often provided via open WiFi APs. Due to the limited range and uncoordinated coverage of these APs, handoffs and prefetching methods have been discussed. Cellular data service is also considered a good source for outdoor data access due to its better coverage and fewer service interruptions. Recent studies in urban areas have compared WiFi and 3G connectivity, showing that they can complement each other.

### 2.3 Characterization of Cellular and Satellite Links
Cellular data service providers use sophisticated control and scheduling methods, which can be highly customized based on QoS and business concerns. Empirical studies have reported transport layer performance over managed cellular data links. Satellite networks, regulated due to limited and expensive bandwidth, have been the subject of research on measuring and tuning TCP performance for long end-to-end latency.

## 3. Measurement Setup

### 3.1 Hardware Platform
In the first phase, we built a mount with two vertical masts on the back corners of a pickup truck, positioning antennas at a 4-meter elevation to match the height of antennas installed on the roof of trailers. We used dual-band flexible omnidirectional antennas, chosen for their durability in harsh conditions. The gain of these antennas is 5 dB, suitable for preventing damage during field operations. AT&T and Verizon 3G modems were used, with external antenna connectors. The installation passed internal environmental qualification tests for vibration and extreme temperatures.

In the second phase, we installed a cellular data modem and a BGAN modem from Inmarsat on trailers of five field crews, using the VSAT modem from iDirect as the data access link to the Internet. Both modems were connected to a Dell Latitude laptop via Ethernet or USB/Ethernet converter, running the measurement application on Windows XP.

### 3.2 Methodology
In the first phase, we visited 12 field-operation locations, using commercial and internal speed test servers to measure upload/download link speeds. Good coverage led us to further compare cellular and satellite links in the second phase.

In the second phase, we developed an application to probe for Internet access every 30 seconds. When field operations started, 1 MByte data files were generated and uploaded to an FTP server inside SINet. Interrupted uploads were resumed when connectivity was restored. Each FTP transmission's size and duration were recorded to compute average TCP throughput.

Throughout the study, we used the original TCP stack of the Windows operating system. Our results can serve as a basis for future efforts to tune the TCP stack for performance improvement over cellular or satellite links.

### 3.3 Switching Between Network Interfaces
To send probe traffic through each network interface, we developed an interface switching mechanism at the application layer by manipulating the Windows operating systemâ€™s local routing table. Different IP addresses were assigned by DHCP protocols on each interface. By setting a routing table entry for all IP addresses, all network traffic was forwarded onto the cellular link. A more specific routing table entry could specify which interface to use for a network application with a predetermined destination IP address.

## 4. Analysis of Measurement Results
