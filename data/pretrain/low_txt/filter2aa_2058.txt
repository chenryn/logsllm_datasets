## Introduction

### HTTPS Encrypted Traffic
- **Adoption Rate:**
  - As of the end of 2016, Google and Mozilla reported that over half of their browser users were using HTTPS protocol encryption.
    - [Google Transparency Report](https://transparencyreport.google.com/https/overview?hl=en)
    - [Let's Encrypt Stats](https://letsencrypt.org/stats/)
  - In March 2018, Cisco's latest survey found that HTTPS traffic reached 50% in October 2017, up from 38% in November 2016, indicating a significant increase.
  - NSS Labs predicts that 75% of network traffic will be encrypted by 2019.

### Malicious Encrypted Traffic
- **Malware Trends:**
  - According to Cisco, the proportion of malware communicating via TLS-encrypted connections increased from 2.21% in 2015 to 21.44% in May 2017.
  - 10-12% of all malware uses HTTPS (January 2016).
    - [Cisco Blog](https://blogs.cisco.com/security/malwares-use-of-tls-and-encryption)
  - 37% of all malware uses HTTPS (June 2017).
    - [Cyren Blog](https://blog.cyren.com/articles/over-one-third-of-malware-uses-https)
  - 97% of HTTPS malware uses port 443, and 87% uses TLS.
  - Additional challenges include SSL/TLS, VPN, I2P, and Tor encryption.

### Solutions
- **Machine Learning-Based Detection:**
  - Transition from signature-based detection to machine learning-based detection.

### Our Project: Deep Learning for Malicious Flow Detection
- **Objective:**
  - Recognize potential malicious behavior based on net flow, especially for encrypted net flows.

### Encrypted Net Flow Example: TLS

    - [CTU-13 Dataset](https://www.stratosphereips.org/datasets-ctu13/)
  - MCFP dataset
    - 340 malware pcap captures
    - [MCFP Dataset](https://stratosphereips.org/category/dataset.html)

  - **UNB Flowmeter:** [GitHub](https://github.com/ISCX/CICFlowMeter)
  - **Bro Logs**
  - **Dpkt:**
    - IP, MAC, TCP, UDP, Level2, Level3, Level4, Level5-7, HTTP, DNS, DHCP, etc.

### Joy Feature Introduction
- **Packet Metadata:**
  - Input/output IP
  - Input/output port number
  - Inbound/outbound bytes
  - Inbound/outbound packets
  - Total duration of the flow (ms)

### HTTP Features
- **Request:**

- dns_ttl (time to live)
- dns_num_ip
- dns_domain_rank

### Sequence of Packet Lengths and Times (SPLT)
- **Malware Behavior:**
  - Communication with command control server
  - Write to the disk
- **Network Behavior:**
  - Time interval between packets
  - Size and timing of the first few packets allow estimation of the data type inside the encrypted channel

### SPLT Example
- **Sequence of Length:**
  - Bin size = 150 bytes
  - 1st packet size: 170 bytes / 150 => 1
  - 2nd packet size: 621 bytes / 150 => 4
- **Sequence of Time:**
  - Bin size = 50 ms
  - 1st packet cost time: 280 ms / 50 => 5
  - 2nd packet cost time: 187 ms / 50 => 3
