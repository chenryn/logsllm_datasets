### Weak Default Credentials by Region and Device Type

In Table 9, we present the distribution of weak FTP and Telnet device populations by region and device type. This table highlights both the fraction of devices that support (Sup) each protocol and the fraction that are vulnerable due to weak default credentials (Vuln). Some regions exhibit a higher prevalence of devices with weak credentials. For example, 50% of FTP devices in Southeast Asia and 4.9% of all Telnet devices in Central Asia have weak default credentials. We also observe a correlation between the likelihood of having weak FTP and Telnet credentials, suggesting that the presence of weak credentials may indicate a generally weaker security posture in the region.

- **Weak FTP Credentials**: 17.4% of devices have weak FTP passwords.
- **Weak Telnet Credentials**: 2.1% of devices have weak Telnet passwords.
- **Common Credential**: "admin/admin" is the most common weak credential, accounting for 88% of weak FTP and 36% of weak Telnet credentials (Table 8).
- **Vendor Distribution**: The "admin/admin" credential is used by FTP devices from 571 vendors and Telnet devices from 160 vendors.

### Regional Variations in Vulnerable IoT Devices

The prevalence of vulnerable IoT devices varies significantly by region:

- **FTP Devices**:
  - **Western Europe**: 14.7% of FTP devices have weak default credentials.
  - **Sub-Saharan Africa**: More than 55% of FTP devices have weak default credentials.
- **Telnet Devices**:
  - **North America**: The smallest vulnerable population (0.5%).
  - **Central Asia and South America**: The largest vulnerable population (4.9% of all IoT Telnet devices), primarily due to their reliance on surveillance devices, which have the weakest Telnet profile among IoT devices.

### Device Types Supporting FTP

Nearly all IoT devices that support FTP fall into the following categories:
- **Work Appliances**: 76%
- **Storage Devices**: 9.1%
- **Media Devices**: 7.6%
- **Surveillance Devices**: 5.1%

Media and surveillance devices appear in this list due to their global popularity. In contrast, only 29% of storage devices and 23% of work appliances support FTP, while only 1% of media devices and 4% of surveillance devices do. This aligns with the business need for file transfer in work and storage devices, explaining the consistent support for FTP across regions.

### Storage Devices and Weak Credentials

Storage devices are the most likely to support FTP, but only a small fraction use weak credentials. Two regional exceptions are East Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, where 12.2% and 10.1% of storage devices, respectively, have weak credentials. This is primarily due to one vendor, ICP Electronics, which has a significant market presence in these regions. 74% of ICP storage devices have weak default credentials.

### Home Routers and FTP Support

Surprisingly, 10.2% of home routers also support FTP. TP-Link is the manufacturer responsible for the most routers with weak FTP credentials. Across all regions, 9.3% of TP-Link devices offer an open FTP port, and 62.8% of these devices are protected by weak credentials.

### Telnet Support in IoT Devices

Unlike FTP, there is little reason for IoT devices to support Telnet in 2019. However, surveillance devices and routers consistently support the protocol. Surveillance devices have the weakest Telnet profile, with 10.7% of devices that support Telnet exhibiting weak credentials. This aligns with anecdotal evidence suggesting that these devices are easy to hack.

### Home Routers: Global and Regional Trends

Almost every home in our dataset has a home router. There are regional differences and a long tail of vendors globally (Table 9). In total, we see home routers from 4.8 K vendors. TP-Link is the most popular manufacturer globally (15% of routers) and is the top provider in five regions: South America, Central Asia, Eastern Europe, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Arris is the most popular router vendor in North America (16.4%), likely because popular ISPs like Comcast supply Arris routers to customers. Huawei is the most popular vendor in Sub-Saharan and North Africa, accounting for 19.8% and 25.6% of all routers, respectively.

### Weak Vendors by Device Type

Table 10 shows the vendors that exhibit weak default credentials across each device type in our dataset, sorted by the fraction of weak devices they contribute to their respective device types. For example, 71.2% of Ricoh printers that support FTP also support weak default credentials, and these make up 29.8% of all weak work appliances.

### External Exposure of Routers

To understand whether routers with weak default credentials are exposed on the public Internet, we joined the WiFi Inspector dataset with Internet-wide scan data from Censys [16] for devices on January 30, 2019. A small number of home routers host publicly accessible services: 3.4% expose HTTP, 0.8% FTP, 0.7% Telnet, and 0.8% SSH. Open gateways are primarily located in three regions—Central America (29.3%), Eastern Europe (20.6%), and Southeast Asia (17.2%). Of the externally exposed routers, 51.2% are exposed with a vulnerability, far higher than the 25.8% of non-externally available routers in our dataset with a weakness or vulnerability. TP-Link is the most popular router vendor in these regions and is responsible for the most externally exposed routers (19.7%).

### Scanning Homes

While scan data can provide insight into the vulnerability of hosts, it typically does not indicate whether hosts have been compromised. We analyzed homes from WiFi Inspector that were seen performing vulnerability scans in a large network telescope on January 1, 2019, to better understand infected devices. Of the 500.7 K homes that WiFi Inspector collected data from that day, 1,865 (0.37%) homes were found to be scanning for vulnerabilities. Scans most frequently target TCP/445 (SMB, 26.7% of homes) followed by TCP/23 (Telnet, 11.3%), TCP/80 (HTTP, 10.7%), and TCP/8080 (HTTP, 9.4%). 1,156 (62%) of scanning homes contained at least one known vulnerability, compared to 7.2 M (46.8%) non-scanning homes. A proportions t-test at a confidence interval of 95% indicates that scanning homes have a higher vulnerability profile than homes globally (p-value: 2.31e-39).

### Discussion

Recent security research has focused on new home IoT devices, such as smart locks and home automation. Our results suggest that while these devices are growing in importance in western regions, they are far from the most common IoT devices globally. Instead, home IoT is better characterized by smart TVs, printers, game consoles, and surveillance devices—devices that have been connected to our home networks for over a decade. These devices still support weak credentials for old protocols, making them a significant security risk. Improving the security posture of these devices remains just as important as ensuring that new technologies are secure.

### Next Steps

As outlined in Section 4, many devices with weak credentials are manufactured by a handful of popular vendors across all regions (Table 10). The security community can address these challenges by encouraging the largest offending vendors to adopt better security practices. On the policy end, law enforcement and legal entities have started to provide legal disincentives for weak security practices. In light of the Mirai attacks, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission has prompted legal action against D-Link [12] for putting U.S. consumers at risk.

A larger question remains on how to address the long tail of vendors. As described in Section 3, regions often have vastly different preferences for vendors across device types. Working to improve the security of devices based solely on the global distribution may inadvertently leave smaller regions with divergent preferences less secure.

Finally, measuring the impact of compromise on home security is challenging. In our work, we measured the prevalence of scanning, though this is just one indication of compromise. We observed 0.37% of homes scanning, amounting to only 1.8 K homes on a single day. Despite the data collected, we could not effectively identify why certain homes were compromised. Researchers have proposed systems to enable auditing of home IoT setups [55, 58], but more work is needed.

### Related Work

Our work builds on research in home network measurement and IoT security. Early research in home network measurement focused on debugging networks, with projects like Netalyzer [35] enabling users to debug their home Internet connectivity [9, 15, 49]. Follow-on papers leveraged Netalyzer-like scans to investigate the state of devices in homes [1, 9, 14] and to understand the implications of a connected home on user behavior [10].

Grover et al. installed home routers with custom firmware in 100 homes across 21 countries to measure the availability, infrastructure, and usage of home networks [26, 53]. Their work focuses on the network properties of home networks, while ours focuses on the devices behind the NAT and their security properties, with particular attention to IoT devices.

Recent work has built off of network scanning to enable rich device identification. Feng et al. built a system that leverages application layer responses to perform device identification without machine learning, similar to our hand-curated expert rules [21]. Other rule-based engines have been used in other work on active, public scan data based on probing for application banners [4, 16].

Home IoT security has been of recent interest due to its growing security and privacy implications. Ma et al. investigated the rise of the Mirai botnet [4], which was largely composed of IoT devices compromised due to weak credentials and used to launch massive DDoS attacks. Researchers have been breaking home IoT devices since their conception [8, 31, 38, 47, 59]. Fernandes et al. outlined challenges in Samsung SmartThings devices, from access control policy to third-party developer integration [22]. In response, researchers have built systems to enable security properties in home IoT, such as information flow tracking and sandboxing [23, 33], improving device authentication [54], and enabling auditing information [55, 58]. Alrawi et al. synthesized the security of home IoT devices into a SoK, presenting a systematization of attacks and defense on home IoT and outlining how to reason about home IoT risk [2].

### Conclusion

In this paper, we conducted the first large-scale empirical analysis of IoT devices on real-world home networks. Leveraging internal network scans of 83M IoT devices in 16M homes worldwide, we found that IoT devices are widespread. In several regions, the majority of homes now have at least one networked IoT device. We analyzed the types and vendors of commonly purchased devices and provided a landscape of the global IoT ecosystem. We further analyzed the security profile of these devices and networks and showed that a significant fraction of devices use weak passwords on FTP and Telnet, are vulnerable to known attacks, and use default HTTP administration passwords that are left unchanged by users. We hope our analysis will help the security community develop solutions applicable to IoT devices already in today’s homes.
