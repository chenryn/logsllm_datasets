### BGP Update Message Handling and IRV Integration

BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) update messages, both locally generated and those intended for forwarding, are associated with a set of neighboring Autonomous Systems (ASes) to which the message must be sent.

To access BGP UPDATE messages received from neighboring BGP speakers, an IRV (Interdomain Routing Validation) server can establish I-BGP (Internal BGP) sessions with all border routers within the AS. This ensures that all BGP messages received from peer ASes are also relayed to the IRV. Figure 3 illustrates this setup, where dark lines represent I-BGP sessions propagating routing information received from routers D, E, F, and G. The IRV can then determine, from the identity of its I-BGP peer, the corresponding AS and foreign BGP speaker that propagated the message to the local AS.

In cases where a router (e.g., A) has BGP sessions with multiple other routers (e.g., D and E), it may be necessary to configure the E-BGP listener locally to use private community fields or other path attributes to signal to the IRV the identity of the foreign speaker.

### Security Considerations

Malicious or compromised routers can manipulate AS-local IRV services by arbitrarily omitting, delaying, or modifying I-BGP messages. However, protecting an AS from its own routers is outside the scope of IRV. We assume that ASes will employ additional infrastructure to detect and disable faulty or compromised routers. Any AS-centric solution must address these issues.

### Dynamic Data Acquisition by the IRV

Maintaining current information regarding BGP UPDATE messages sent to foreign ASes is more challenging. There is no convenient way to intercept outbound E-BGP sessions, as they traverse a direct physical link between the E-BGP speaker and listener. For each outbound E-BGP session, we recommend configuring the corresponding border router to establish a second outbound E-BGP session with the IRV, configured to send the same data as the original session with the remote AS. The gray lines in Figure 3 reflect this configuration. Border routers that serve as BGP speakers in multiple BGP sessions establish multiple BGP sessions with the IRV. The IRV then acts as an E-BGP listener, treating each E-BGP session as authoritative with respect to the original outbound E-BGP session it mirrors.

### Querying the IRV

A related issue involves who issues requests on behalf of an AS. Operators can query the IRV manually or via scheduled scripts, but to fully leverage the system, an AS must systematically form queries in response to received UPDATE messages. For this purpose, we recommend establishing an IRV client system, called the Network Management Element (NME). The NME listens to I-BGP messages from E-BGP listeners at the border of the AS and collects them for forming and sending useful queries. Since the IRV server already listens to I-BGP messages, it may make sense to collocate the IRV client and server on the same physical machine, although this is not strictly necessary.

### System Limitations

The fundamental limitation of any supervisory system is that it is only as good as the data it contains. Since some of the data in IRV are configuration and policy data maintained by human operators, there is always the chance that the data in the IRV differ from the actual router configurations. Many operators still configure routers by entering commands at the console prompt, leading to many problems. To address this, a front end needs to be developed where new configurations are atomically transferred to both the IRV and the affected routers. Such a front end would be useful regardless of IRV adoption.

Operators often enter configurations directly on routers because it is easy and the router configurations are the authoritative source of policy. Much of the data in RRs (Routing Registries) is outdated, incomplete, or incorrect, and operators derive no immediate benefit from updating them. However, the distributed nature of IRV, where information is created and managed by network operators, makes it easier to keep the information correct.

Even with transactional semantics for updating routers and the IRV, there will always be a short interval between the actual update and when the update propagates to the entire Internet. It is conceivable that a query from a remote AS could be initiated right after a change in the IRV was committed but before the change propagated over BGP. The IRV could store historical data to furnish on demand, but this adds complexity to the protocol. On the positive side, the IRV could track how frequently it gets requests or reports pointing to inconsistencies, helping to deduce potential BGP propagation problems.

### Deployment Considerations

Another consideration is the "network effect": the usefulness of a technology being proportional to the number of users. An operator deploying IRV in their own network initially gains little, but it can be used to perform sanity checks on itself by setting up multihop BGP sessions with routers of other ISPs. Once more than one AS start deploying IRV, they can check each other's configurations. The deployment cost and value of benefits need to be evaluated to determine the break-even point.

### Conclusions

BGP is the dominant protocol for interdomain routing, but current implementations provide little security. Emerging standards aim to address this by augmenting BGP with security infrastructure. However, such infrastructure often assumes universal deployment, requires significant computational resources, or provides limited policy communication. Exploitation of weaknesses in the current interdomain routing infrastructure could result in significant costs.

We have introduced the Interdomain Routing Validation (IRV) system, which, when used with BGP, provides interfaces for validating BGP data and acquiring additional routing information. Participating ASes designate an IRV that processes requests from remote users. These requests consist of queries to implement features not currently present in BGP. Network security protocols ensure the integrity, authenticity, and timeliness of the queries and responses.

Ultimately, the value of IRV lies in its effectiveness in increasing an AS's ability to correctly obtain and manage interdomain routing information. Providing a common interface is key to achieving this goal. IRV is a receiver-driven architecture, giving users of routing announcements a role in obtaining the information they need. The ability of IRV speakers to tailor responses to the requester affords greater control over how and to whom route information is shared. Requesters can share information about received announcements with originators, providing originators with introspection into how their announcements appear to the world.

The routing facilities supported by an AS are specific to its administration. Services like IRV are a natural progression in interdomain routing, allowing future enhancements to be quickly implemented, tested, and deployed. Incremental deployability is crucial for BGP security, and IRV increases the security and accuracy of interdomain routing information precisely within the community in which it is deployed.

Future work includes characterizing and evaluating the cost of clients requesting information from the administrative server, designing highly-scalable server implementations, and exploring the potential uses of IRV in other services such as quality of service, load balancing, and congestion control. This work will seek to use IRV to communicate service-specific requirements between ASes and influence interdomain routing.
