## Abstract
Policy-based cryptography is a promising paradigm for establishing trust and authorization in large-scale open environments such as the Internet and mobile networks. It provides a framework for performing cryptographic operations based on policies formalized as monotone Boolean expressions in standard normal forms. A policy consists of conjunctions and disjunctions of conditions, where each condition is satisfied by a digital credential representing the signature of a specific credential issuer on a set of statements about an entity. An entity fulfills a policy if and only if it has been issued a set of credentials that satisfy the combination of conditions specified by the policy.

In this work, we focus on policy-based encryption schemes, which allow encrypting a message according to a policy so that only entities fulfilling the policy can decrypt the message. More generally, policy-based encryption belongs to an emerging family of encryption schemes that integrate encryption with access control structures. This integration is primarily enabled by bilinear pairings over elliptic curves and supports various applications in different contexts.

A policy-based encryption scheme must meet two primary requirements: provable security under well-defined attack models and efficiency, especially when handling conjunctions and disjunctions of credential-based conditions. Our research contributions are twofold:

1. **Security Model and Scheme Development**:
   - The standard notion of security for public-key encryption schemes is indistinguishability against chosen ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA). We adapt this notion to the policy-based setting and define a policy-oriented security model.
   - We develop an efficient policy-based encryption scheme that is provably secure under our security model in the random oracle model.

2. **Addressing Key-Escrow**:
   - Policy-based encryption schemes may suffer from the key-escrow property, where any collusion of credential issuers who can issue a set of credentials fulfilling the policy can also decrypt the message.
   - We introduce the concept of policy-based public-key encryption, which allows encrypting a message not only with respect to a policy but also according to a public key. Only an entity fulfilling the policy and having access to the corresponding private key can decrypt the message.
   - We develop a policy-based public-key encryption scheme from bilinear pairings and prove its security under the corresponding security model. Our proposal improves upon related work in terms of both security and efficiency.
