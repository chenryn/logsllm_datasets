## About Us
This research is a collaborative effort between the Incident Response and Telco Security Teams at [Company Name].

## Introduction
This document provides an in-depth analysis of the technologies behind telecommunications (telco) networks, the types of incidents that can occur, and the methods for detecting and mitigating these incidents.

## Technologies Behind Telco Networks
### Overview
We will explore the technologies that underpin modern telco networks and how they function. This includes:
- **Current Usage**: The services and applications we use today.
- **Underlying Technologies**: The foundational technologies that make these services possible.

## Types of Incidents
Incidents in telco networks can be categorized into several types:
- **Subscriber Location Tracking**
- **Call Interception (Wiretapping)**
- **SMS Interception and Spoofing**
- **Denial of Service (DoS), including Balance DoS**
- **Other Fraudulent Activities**

### Example
- **Phone Number**: +7 777 5555555
- **GPS Location**: [Example GPS Coordinates]

## Incident Statistics and Major Threats
### Service Disruption
- **Data Leakage**
- **Fraud**

### Percentage of Vulnerable Networks
- **Subscriber’s Balance Disclosure**
- **Terminating SMS Interception**
- **Subscriber Location Discovery**
- **Voice Call Interception**
- **Subscriber’s Data Leakage**

### Fraud Cases
- **Terminating Call Redirection**
- **Money Transfer via USSD**
- **Subscriber Profile Change**
- **Originating Call Redirection**

### Percentage of Vulnerable Networks
- [Insert specific percentages here]

## Incident Victims
- **Mobile Operator Subscribers**
- **Mobile Operators**
- **Other Mobile Operators and Their Subscribers**
- **Third Parties (Often Banks and Their Clients)**

## Prerequisites of Attacks
- **Internal Intruder or Staff-Initiated Attacks**
- **Level 0 (Kiddies)**: Attacks that do not require deep technical knowledge.
- **SMS Fraud as a Preliminary Stage of Malware-Based Attacks**
- **Fraud with Social Engineering** (Targeting the victim directly)
- **Proxified Fraud with Social Engineering**
- **Level 1 (Locally Initiated)**: Attacks that require technical knowledge about Radio Access Network protocols.
  - **IMSI Catcher**
  - **Bluetooth**
  - **Calls and SMS from Nearby Subscribers**
- **Level 2 (Global Impact)**: Attacks that require technical knowledge about telco infrastructure and protocols.

### Lightweight Scenarios (Level 0)
- **Kiddies Fraud Examples**
  - **Typosquatting**: A common example is `http://journal.tinkoff.ru/declined/` (not legitimate).
  - **Legitimate URL**: `http://journal.tinkoff.ru/`
  - **Example Message**: "You received 30,000 RUB, please follow the link for confirmation."
  - **Example Message**: "Purchase. Card *1234. Amount 600 RUB. Drugstore 2000… Available balance 82,634.32 RUB."
  - **Central Bank Scam**: `http://www.rbc.ru/finances/17/03/2016/56e97c089a794797e5b8e6b3/Cental Bank of Russian Federation/`
    - **Message**: "Your banking cards accounts were suspended! Info: +79649910054"

### Social Engineering of Telco Staff
- **Temporary Redirect Calls and SMS to Another Number**
- **Access to Victim's Email, Social Media Accounts, Messengers, and Sometimes Money (Banking OTP)**
- **Fast Win Scenarios**

### Level 1 Cases
- **SMS Interception**
- **Voice Call Interception**
  - **Originating Call**
  - **Terminating Call**
  - **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack**

### Level 2 Cases (Global Impact)
- **Telco Infrastructure, Technical View**
- **IMSI Disclosure**
- **Money Fraud Cases**
  - **Infect Smartphone with Malware**
  - **Use Fake Base Station (IMSI Catcher) to Clone SIM Card**
  - **Conduct SS7 Network Attack by Forging USSD Requests**

### USSD Manipulation
- **Request the Balance**: `*100#` (Balance: 128.55 Roubles)
- **Transfer 10 Roubles**: `*145*xxxxxx81142*10#`
- **Confirm Transaction**: `*145*851#`
- **New Balance**: 118.55 Roubles (10 Roubles ~ 0.15 €)

### More Sophisticated Attacks
- **Voice Call Redirection with Fraudulent Activity**
  - **Billing**
  - **GMSC**
  - **HLR**
  - **IMSI and CFU Manipulation**
  - **InitialDP and ApplyCharging, Continue**

### Example of Voice Call Redirection
- **Billing**
- **GMSC**
- **HLR**
- **IAM (A-Number, B-Number)**
- **SendRoutingInfo (MSISDN)**
- **RegisterSS (IMSI, CFU, 5312345678)**
- **InitialDP (B-Number, 5312345678)**
- **ApplyCharging, Continue**
- **IAM (A-Number, 5312345678)**
- **Who Pays?**

### Fraud Case 2
- **Billing**
- **GMSC**
- **HLR**
- **IAM (A-Number, B-Number)**
- **SendRoutingInfo (MSISDN)**
- **SendRoutingInfo (CFU, 5312345678)**
- **RegisterSS (IMSI, CFU, 5312345678)**
- **InitialDP (B-Number, 5312345678)**
- **ApplyCharging, Continue**
- **IAM (A-Number, 5312345678)**
- **Who Pays?**
