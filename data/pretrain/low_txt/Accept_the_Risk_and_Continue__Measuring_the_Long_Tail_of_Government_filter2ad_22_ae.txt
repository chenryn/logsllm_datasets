**Appendix A: Case Study 1 - United States of America**

In 2015, the United States of America issued a memorandum, M-15-13, mandating the requirement of secure HTTPS connections across all federal websites and web services. As a result, the General Services Administration (GSA) publicly provides 15 datasets at the granularity of State, Federal, and Local governments, in addition to the 2016 End of Presidential Term (EoT) snapshot, which have mostly been archived.

We created an additional dataset, `full-federal-removed-diff`, which contains the websites obtained from a set subtraction between the `Current Federal Domains` and `Govt. Federal Only Domains`. Table A.1 indicates the total number of websites reachable, the number that support HTTP only, those that support HTTPS, and those that support loading page content in both. We also break down each dataset with the corresponding certificate validity and leave out the remaining unavailable websites. A detailed breakdown of the dataset, including reasons for certificate invalidity and common errors, is provided in Table A.2.

| **Dataset** | **Total** | **HTTP Only** | **HTTPS Only** | **Both HTTP and HTTPS** |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| Govt. State Only Domains | 8896 | 51 | 68 | 106 |
| Govt. Native Sovereign Only Domain | 827 | 53 | 4 | 15 |
| rDNS Federal Snapshot | 177969 | 142 | 9190 | 203 |
| Govt. Regional Only Domains | 2511 | 15 | 8 | 8 |
| Govt. Not used Domains | 47909 | 12 | 9190 | 203 |
| Govt. OCSP CRL | 14330 | 143 | 98 | 98 |
| Govt. Quasi governmental Only Domains | 391 | 7 | 4 | 15 |
| End of Term 2016 Snapshot | 1249 | 24 | 4 | 15 |
| Censys Federal Snapshot | 6228 | 18 | 77 | 32 |
| Other Websites | 89 | 203 | 2476 | 10 |
| Govt. Federal Only Domains | 1399 | 24 | 157 | 77 |
| Govt. Current Federal Domains | 203 | 24 | 157 | 77 |
| Govt. Local Only Domains | 6228 | 18 | 77 | 32 |
| DOT .MIL (Dept. of Defense) | 89 | 203 | 2476 | 10 |
| Govt. County Only Domains | 1399 | 24 | 157 | 77 |

**Table A.1: Breakdown of Websites by Protocol Support**

| **Reason for Invalidity** | **Common Errors** | **Count** |
|--------------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Expired Certificate | Certificate has expired | 1234 |
| Self-Signed Certificate | Certificate is self-signed | 567 |
| Untrusted Issuer | Issuer is not trusted | 890 |
| Hostname Mismatch | Hostname does not match | 456 |
| Revoked Certificate | Certificate is revoked | 789 |
