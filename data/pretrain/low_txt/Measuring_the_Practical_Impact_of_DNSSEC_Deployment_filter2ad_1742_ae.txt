### Detection of Attacks and DNSSEC Deployment

For a site with a global user base, our findings suggest that deploying DNSSEC in the current environment can result in a self-inflicted partial attack on one’s own site, with a failure rate of approximately 0.2214% (the difference between the goodsec and nosec failure rates). For sites with minimal Asian user traffic, the trade-off appears more favorable, while for those with a predominantly Asian user base, it is less so.

The primary cause of increased failure rates from DNSSEC deployment seems to be the larger packet sizes, which force clients to use DNS over TCP instead of DNS over UDP. The failure rate for DNS over TCP is roughly ten times higher than that for DNS over UDP. This issue is particularly pronounced in the Asia/Pacific region.

### Potential Future Developments

Several future developments could alter this situation. First, if a significant number of ISPs deploy validating resolvers, it could have a substantial impact. As shown by Comcast data in Section 4.1.5, unilateral DNSSEC deployment by ISPs can greatly influence their customers' behavior. If major ISPs were to deploy validating resolvers, the measured badsec failure rate would likely increase, but their customers would gain some level of protection against external attackers. However, validation at the ISP resolver level does not protect against on-path attackers.

Second, widespread adoption of technologies like DANE, which depend on DNSSEC, could provide additional security. While DNSSEC for A records does not secure against on-path attackers who can intercept traffic between the client and server, DANE can attest to end-user certificates. Combining DNSSEC with DANE-based certificates can offer robust protection against such attacks, providing a significant benefit. However, the collective action problem of simultaneous client and server deployment remains, and DANE's security requires client-side DNSSEC validation, which ISP-level validation cannot fully address.

### Caution for Future Research

Our results also serve as a caution for future researchers: studies based on advertisement networks, especially those measuring success or failure, are highly sensitive to variations in client and network behavior. Significant variations exist between browsers and operating systems, as well as within the same browser/operating system pair, depending on the request order. These variations are of the same magnitude as the signal we are trying to measure, presenting a significant challenge. Additionally, they may indicate actual problems with the browsers or opportunities for improvement. We are currently collaborating with browser vendors to understand the reasons behind these anomalies.

### Related Work

Several research groups have conducted measurements related to DNSSEC. The SecSpider project [35, 36, 43] has surveyed DNSSEC-secured zones since the rollout, using metrics of availability, verifiability, and validity. Deccio et al. [14, 15] surveyed representative DNSSEC domains for misconfiguration. Both projects focus on properties of authoritative DNS server zone data rather than resolver or cache behavior.

Other research groups have characterized the overhead of deploying DNSSEC. Ager, Dreger, and Feldmann [2] used DNS traffic traces for a testbed experiment, noting potential overhead from packet fragmentation. Wijngaards and Overeinder [42] described the design of a DNSSEC resolver and validator, comparing its performance to an ordinary DNS resolver. Migault, Girard, and Laurent [31] measured DNSSEC resolution overhead in a lab setting, including the NSEC3 option.

Gudmundsson and Crocker [18] measured the deployment of DNSSEC-capable resolvers using traces of DNS queries to .org servers. Glynn [17] surveyed DNSSEC deployment in Ireland, highlighting the possibility of large responses suffering from fragmentation and noting geographic variation in client path MTU. Dietrich [16] reported on a study of home DSL routers, finding that more than half of the tested routers were incompatible with DNSSEC.

Herzberg and Shulman [19] discussed challenges to wide-scale DNSSEC deployment, observing that large-response fragmentation can reduce performance and enable downgrade and forgery attacks on permissive resolvers. Pappas and Keromytis [37] performed distributed measurements of resolution failures after the May 5, 2010 signing of the DNS root, making resolution attempts from geographically dispersed nodes.

Krishnan and Monrose [28] conducted a large-scale measurement of browser DNS prefetching, characterizing its security and privacy implications. The Netalyzr platform [27] allows users to measure and report on their Internet connection properties, uncovering widespread DNS manipulation by ISPs [40, 41].

Zhang et al. [44] included client-side DNS measurement code in a widely used software package, identifying several ISPs that manipulate DNS results to proxy and modify web searches. Ager et al. [3] asked friends to run DNS measurement code on their systems, focusing on DNS performance. Honda et al. [21] asked IETF colleagues to run a tool generating TCP segments with various properties, observing how middleboxes handle different TCP extensions. Their work is closest in spirit to ours, as they measured the compatibility of hypothetical future protocols with deployed middleboxes.

### Summary

DNS name resolution is a critical part of the Internet infrastructure, but it has long been known to be insecure. DNSSEC aims to address this insecurity. Our large ad network-based study measures the current state of DNSSEC deployment and the extent to which deploying DNSSEC-signed domains creates collateral damage in the form of failed resolutions of valid domains.

Our measurements confirm that DNSSEC deployment is proceeding slowly. Less than 3% of clients fail to retrieve resources hosted on DNSSEC-signed domains with broken signatures, indicating that either these clients or their resolvers are not performing DNSSEC validation or are not hard-failing on broken validations. Additionally, about 1.006% of clients fail to retrieve validly DNSSEC-signed resources, compared to 0.7846% of unsigned resources. This means that for every ten clients a site protects by using DNSSEC, it inadvertently DoSes about one client. This effect is primarily due to TCP fallback to accommodate larger DNSSEC packet sizes and is strongly localized to Asian users.

We also report on new measurement artifacts that can affect the results of advertising network-based studies, including browser-specific anomalies that may reveal opportunities for improvement. In future work, we aim to explore the specific causes of these anomalies.
