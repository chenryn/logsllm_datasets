When I attempt to close an unsaved file, a popup appears with the message: "foo has changes. Do you want to save them?" The popup includes three options: "Save," "Cancel," and "Don't Save."

In the standard Windows dialog for this scenario, I can press the "n" key to select "Don't Save." It would be beneficial if Atom could also support this functionality, at least on the Windows platform. 

Would it be possible to implement this feature in Atom?
