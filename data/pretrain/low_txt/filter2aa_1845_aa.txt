- **Future Stage**: Stage 3 - Limited Self-Driving Automation

---

### Barriers to Stage 3+ Autonomy
- **Ethical Responsibilities**: Determining who is responsible for reacting to safety-critical events.
- **Technological Infrastructure**: Installation of roadside units, data centers, etc.
- **Machine Learning**: Development of adaptive and intuitive machine-learning technology.

---

### V2X Concept
- **Network Utilization**: Vehicles and infrastructure use WAVE over a 5.8-5.9 GHz ad hoc mesh network to exchange state information.
- **Integration**: Linking WAVE/DSRC radios to the vehicle's bus system to enable automated hazard awareness and avoidance.
- **Bridge to Full Autonomy**: V2X serves as a technological bridge to fully autonomous vehicles.

---

### Critical Aspects of V2V
- **High Throughput Network**: Vehicular ad hoc mesh network (VANET) with high throughput.
- **Safety Features**: Provides safety features beyond the capability of onboard sensors.
- **Consumer Adoption**: Designed for widespread adoption in consumer automotive systems.
- **Integration**: Easy integration with existing transportation infrastructure.
- **First Application**: The first application of stage 3 automation in the consumer marketplace.

---

### Impact of V2X Technologies
- **Societal Impact**: Transportation networks affect all aspects of society.

---

### Impact of V2X Technologies: Consumer Benefits
- **Safety**:
  - Prevent 25,000 to 592,000 crashes annually.
  - Avoid 11,000 to 270,000 injuries.
  - Prevent 31,000 to 728,000 property-damaging crashes.
- **Traffic Flow Optimization**:
  - 27% reduction for freight.
  - 23% reduction for emergency vehicles.
  - 42% reduction on freeways (with cooperative adaptive cruise control and speed harmonization).

---

### Impact of V2X Technologies: Global Industry
- **Scalability**: Scalable across various industrial platforms.
- **Swarm Functions**: Optimizes swarm functions.
- **Sensor Data Exchange**: Improves the exchange of sensor data.
- **Worker Safety**: Enhances worker safety.
- **Vehicle-to-Pedestrian Communication**: Beneficial in construction, agriculture, and maintenance.
- **Logistical Operations**: Improves logistical operations management, akin to air traffic control for trucks.

---

### Impact of V2X Technologies: Critical Infrastructure
- **Interface for VANET**: Provides an interface for infrastructure to leverage VANET.
- **Traffic Awareness**: Increases awareness of traffic patterns in specific regions.
- **Civil Engineering**: Facilitates improvements in civil engineering processes through network traffic analysis.
- **Emergency Alerts**: Enables fast and widespread distribution of emergency alerts.
- **Cost Reduction**: Reduces the cost of public transit systems.

---

### Impact of V2X Technologies: Automotive Security
- **Wireless Attack Vector**: Creates a wide open wireless attack vector into the transportation network.
- **Propagation of Injections**: Injections can easily propagate across the entire VANET.
- **Reverse Engineering**: Wireless reverse engineering using 1609 and J2735 standards.
- **Malware Distribution**: Easy to distribute malware on a large scale.

---

### Technologies Using V2X
- **Collision Avoidance**: Forward Collision Warning systems.
- **Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)**.
- **Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control**.
- **Automated Ticketing and Tolling**.

---

### Vision of SocketV2V
- **Security**: Emphasizes that security through obscurity leads to inevitable compromise.
- **Community Involvement**: Calls for the involvement of the security community in the development of public safety systems.
- **Development Catalyst**: Aims to catalyze the development of secure, functional connected systems.
- **Standard Hardware Interface**: Provides an interface to VANET using standard COTS hardware.

---

### Background on SocketV2V
- **Development Timeline**: Linux V2V development began in November 2015.
- **Existing Work**: Found to be incomplete, with no open-source implementation.
- **Integration Attempts**: Efforts to integrate into linux-wireless since 2004.
- **Debugging**: Two years of kernel debugging later, V2V is now a reality.

---

### Motivation for V2X Development
- **Inadequate Standards**: Current standards for onboard vehicle communications are not designed to handle VANET.
- **Increased Attack Surface**: Increased automation leads to an increased attack surface.
- **Proprietary Solutions**: The auto industry is calling for proprietary solutions, leading to monopolization.
- **Incomplete Standards**: Standards are still incomplete and subject to change, making proprietary solutions obsolete.
- **Multiple Standards**: Multiple alternative standards are being developed independently across borders.
- **Imminent Deployment**: Immediate attention is required due to imminent deployment.

### Lessons Learned from Previous Epic Failure
1. **Kernel Development**: Understanding the true nature of kernel development.
2. **Open Source**: Closed-source development leads to failure; sharing is crucial.
3. **Standards Committees**: Standards committees need significant help addressing the complexity of new and future systems.

### V2X Stack Overview
- **802.11p**: Supports WAVE/DSRC, operates in the 5.8-5.9 GHz band, with no association, authentication, or encryption.
- **IEEE 1609**: Includes security services, networking services, multi-channel operation, and identifier allocations.
- **SAE J2735**: Specifies message formats and data elements, including basic safety messages and collision avoidance.

---

### State of V2X Standards: Evolution
- **Drafting and Revisions**: WAVE drafted in 2005, J2735 in 2006, with revisions that are not backward-compatible.
- **Pilot Studies**: Three active pilot studies by USDOT and experimental V2X deployment in the EU.

- **Management Plane**: Adding new services like P2PCD.
- **Message Encoding**: Multiple changes in encoding formats (BER, DER, UPER).
- **ASN1 Configuration**: Revision of trust management system, still incomplete.

---

### (Possibly Unintentional) Obfuscation of the Standards
- **Lack of Specification**: No clear handling for service management and RF optimization.
- **Design Justification**: Minimal justification for design choices.
