## What is an Autonomous Vehicle?
Autonomous vehicles, or self-driving cars, are designed to operate without human intervention. They use a combination of sensors, controllers, and software to navigate and make decisions.

### Levels of Driving Automation
- **Level 0**: No Automation
- **Level 1**: Driver Assistance
- **Level 2**: Partial Automation
- **Level 3**: Conditional Automation
- **Level 4**: High Automation
- **Level 5**: Full Automation

### Connected Automated Vehicles
Connected automated vehicles (CAVs) leverage vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication to enhance safety and efficiency.

### How Can Cars Be Autonomous?
#### Hardware Architecture
- **Sensors**: Radar, Ultrasound, Camera, LiDAR
- **Controllers**: Electric Power Steering, Electronic Throttle, Electronic Brake
- **Autonomous System**: Maneuver Planning, Trajectory Planning, State Machine

#### Vehicle Sensors
- **Radar**: Works in low light and poor weather but has lower resolution.
- **Ultrasound**: Limited to proximity and low-speed maneuvers.
- **Camera**: Senses reflected light and can read signs and signals but is limited in darkness.
- **LiDAR**: Emits light, so darkness is not an issue, but it has some weather limitations.

#### Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS)
- **Applications**: Lane departure warning, traffic sign recognition, parking assistance
- **Demo**: Tesla Model S Autopilot

## Hacking Autonomous Cars by Sensors
### Types of Attacks
- **Spoofing**: Transmitting false data to deceive the sensor.
- **Jamming**: Injecting noise to disrupt the sensor's operation.
- **Blinding**: Overloading the sensor with light or other signals.

### Attacking Ultrasonic Sensors
- **On Tesla, Audi, Volkswagen, and Ford**
- **How Ultrasonic Sensors Work**: Piezoelectric effect, emitting and receiving ultrasound, measuring time of flight.
- **Attacks**
  - **Jamming**: Injecting ultrasonic noise to lower SNR.
  - **Spoofing**: Transmitting similar ultrasonic pulses.
  - **Acoustic Quieting**: Cloaking and sound cancellation techniques.

### Attacking Millimeter Wave Radars
- **On Tesla Model S**
- **How MMW Radars Work**: Transmitting and receiving millimeter waves, measuring propagation time, using FMCW modulation.
- **Attacks**
  - **Jamming**: Jamming radars within the same frequency band.
  - **Spoofing**: Spoofing the radar with similar RF signals.
  - **Relay**: Relaying the received signal.

### Attacking Cameras
- **On Mobileye, Point Grey, and Tesla Model S**
- **How Automotive Cameras Work**: Computer vision for lane departure, traffic sign recognition, and parking assistance.
- **Attacks**
  - **Blinding**: Using LED, laser, and infrared to blind the camera.

## Discussion
- **Attack Feasibility**: Realistic threats to automotive sensor security.
- **Countermeasures**: Potential solutions to mitigate attacks.
- **Limitations and Future Work**: Ongoing research and future directions.

## Conclusions and Takeaway Messages
- **Realistic Issues**: Security vulnerabilities in autonomous vehicle sensors.
- **Big Threats**: Significant risks to both current and future autonomous vehicles.
- **Types of Attacks**: Detailed exploration of attacks on ultrasonic sensors, MMW radars, and cameras.
