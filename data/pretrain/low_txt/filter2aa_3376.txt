## Motivation
- **Attack Vectors:** The current landscape is rife with Wi-Fi attacks.
- **Defense Mechanisms:** There is a critical need for effective defense solutions.
- **Problem Importance:** Wi-Fi security is a significant concern.
- **Solution Viability:** Chellam offers a viable and practical solution.

## Enterprise Focus
### Current Solutions
- **Lockdown Measures:** Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.
- **Policy-Based Access:** SSID-based policies
- **BYOD Readiness:** Limited support for Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)
- **Attack Detection:** No built-in detection mechanisms
- **Heterogeneous Devices:** Varied operating systems and non-standard Wi-Fi APIs (e.g., iOS)

### Beyond the Enterprise
- **Personal Devices:** Millions of internet-capable devices.
- **Internet of Things (IoT):** Growing number of connected devices.

## Wi-Fi Client Attack Surface
- **Honeypots:** AP-less WEP/WPA/WPA2 cracking
- **Evil Twins:** Mis-associations and hosted network backdoors

## Typical Attacks
- **AP-less Cracking:** 
  - No Encryption
  - WEP
  - WPA/WPA2 PSK
  - WPA/WPA2 PEAP, EAP-TTLS
  - Cloud Cracking (Caffe Latte, Hirte, Handshake, MS-CHAPv2 CR)

- **Layer 2 Hijacking:**
  - Traffic Monitoring
  - DNS Hijacking
  - SSL Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)
  - Application Attacks

## Scope
- **Windows Endpoints:** No custom hardware or drivers required.
- **Detection Capabilities:**
  - Honeypot creation tools
  - Firewall-like rule creation ("Allow," "Deny")
  - Wi-Fi state machine monitoring
  - Wi-Fi backdoor detection

## Architecture
### Block Diagram
- **Wi-Fi Native API:**
  - State Machine
  - Scan Data
  - Network Profiles
  - Card Control
- **Data Collection Engine:**
  - Event Data
  - BSS Information
  - Profile XML Data
  - Hardware State Data
- **Data Storage:**
  - SQLite databases
  - Easy plugin development
  - Third-party tool integration
- **Analysis Engine:**
  - Rule Matching Engine
- **Presentation Layer:**
  - Application GUI

### Technical Details
- **802.11 State Machine:** Per Wi-Fi card
- **Periodic Scan Results:** BSS data
- **XML Network Profiles:** Scan, Connect, Disconnect, Lock, etc.
- **Documentation:** [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms706839(v=vs.85).aspx)

## Data Collection and Storage
- **SQLite Databases:** Facilitates easy plugin development and third-party tool integration.

## Rule Matching and Analysis
- **Rules Can Include:**
  - BSSID
  - Neighboring Networks
  - Channel Use Patterns and Frequencies
  - Information Elements in Beacon/Probe Response
  - Time-of-Day Access Patterns

## Attack Detection
- **Fingerprinting:**
  - BSSID(s)
  - BSS Type
  - PHY Type
  - Beacon Interval
  - Channels & Hopping
  - Basic and Extended Rates
  - Capability Information
  - Information Elements
  - Neighboring Access Points
  - IP, Gateway, DNS, ARP Cache
  - Subnet Scan
  - OS and Service Scan

- **Mitigation:**
  - BSSID(s)
  - Channels & Hopping
  - Basic and Extended Rates
  - Capability Information
  - Information Elements
  - Neighboring Access Points

## Why is This Important?
- **Enhanced Attack Tools:** Attackers will need to improve their tools.
- **Fingerprinting Challenges:**
  - No hardcoded values, random BSSID
  - Mimicking authorized networks
  - Clock synchronization
  - Correct channel and band usage
- **Whitelist Approach:** Very difficult to bypass.

## Roadmap
- **Whitelist vs. Blacklist:**
- **Plugin Architecture:**
  - SQL with Python
- **Intrusion Prevention/Firewall:**
  - Custom Driver
- **Automatic Learning:**
  - Assisted and automatic whitelist learning
- **Downloadable Blacklists:**
  - For known attack tools
