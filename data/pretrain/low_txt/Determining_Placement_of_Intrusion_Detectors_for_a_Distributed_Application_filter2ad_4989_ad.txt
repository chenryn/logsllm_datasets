### Results and Performance Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of our detection system, we utilized the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve for the two primary attack goals: node 19 and node 21 in both the e-commerce and Voice over IP (VoIP) systems. For each pair of detectors, we generated 10,000 samples from the Bayesian network, representing a corresponding number of actual attacks. We then performed Bayesian inference to calculate the conditional probability of an attack step given the pair of detectors. By varying threshold values, we determined the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR).

The results indicate that the pair of detectors selected by our algorithm outperforms other randomly selected pairs. Specifically, Figure 11a illustrates a scenario where a single detector (d20) attached to two attack nodes (x19, x18) performs better than two separate detectors (e.g., d13 and d7, or d12 and d3). This can be attributed to the fact that node 18 is more highly connected in the attack graph, making it a more effective location for the detector.

#### ROC Curves for Detector Pairs
- **E-commerce Network (Left):**
  - (d20, x19), (d20, x18)
  - (d20, x19), (d20, x16)
  - (d13, x12), (d7, x6)
  - (d13, x12), (d3, x2)

- **VoIP Network (Right):**
  - (d22, x20), (d18, x17)
  - (d18, x17), (d18, x14)
  - (d18, x12), (d18, x14)
  - (d18, x12), (d6, x4)

### Cost Considerations and Detector Placement

Adding detectors to a system incurs costs, not only in terms of hardware but also in bandwidth and computational resources. Therefore, while adding more edges between detector nodes and attack nodes in the Bayesian network may be feasible, it may not always be desirable. For the VoIP network, the detector pair (d22, d18) performed best, demonstrating that two separate high-quality detectors can outperform a single detector attached to multiple nodes.

Further details on the experiments, including all probability values used in the Bayesian networks, are available in [22]. These details are omitted here due to space constraints, but interested readers are encouraged to refer to the reference for a comprehensive understanding. The experiments validate the intuition behind our algorithm, showing that the greedy choice of detectors yields good results when multiple detectors are considered together across the entire Bayesian network.

### Related Work

Bayesian networks have been widely used in intrusion detection for event classification. Kruegel et al. [17] proposed using Bayesian networks to reduce false alarms, demonstrating improved accuracy compared to threshold-based schemes. Ben Amor et al. [4] compared naive Bayes with decision trees, finding that naive Bayes, due to its simpler structure and comparable performance, is an attractive alternative for intrusion detection. Other researchers have also employed naive Bayesian inference for classifying intrusion events [29].

To the best of our knowledge, the problem of determining optimal detector locations has not been systematically explored in the intrusion detection community. However, analogous problems have been studied in physical security and sensor networks. Jones et al. [15] developed a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model to determine the placement of barriers to protect physical facilities. In sensor networks, Anjum et al. [1] addressed the problem of placing intrusion detectors in hierarchical sensor networks, aiming to minimize the number of tamper-resistant nodes required for signature-based intrusion detection.

In [5], the sensor placement problem was studied for detecting contamination sources, highlighting the NP-hard nature of the problem and providing approximation algorithms. Krause et al. [16] presented a polynomial-time algorithm for near-optimal sensor placement, leveraging submodularity and locality properties. Ray et al. [27] focused on unique localization in indoor environments, using identifying code theory to reduce the number of active sensors.

### Conclusions and Future Work

Bayesian networks have proven to be a valuable tool for representing complex probability distributions, such as the likelihood of achieving an attack goal given evidence from detectors. Using attack graphs and Bayesian inference, we quantified the overall detection performance and the information gain from detectors based on their distance from the attack step. Our experiments also demonstrated the resiliency of Bayesian networks to imperfect knowledge in conditional probability values.

Future work should address the scalability issues of Bayesian networks and their impact on determining detector locations in distributed systems. Techniques like recursive noisy-OR modeling [19] could help in acquiring probability values, and further experimentation is needed to assess their benefits and limitations in our context.
