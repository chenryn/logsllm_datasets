**Title: BotConf 2015: Inside DarkComet - A Comprehensive Case Study**

This research presents a framework for the automated analysis of malware samples, with a specific focus on botnet binaries. The framework automates the collection, analysis, and infiltration of botnets, which has become essential due to the increasing number of malware samples released daily. Such frameworks are now indispensable for anti-malware organizations and product vendors. Recent academic research has also contributed to the design and development of these frameworks.

A detailed case study was conducted, resulting in the collection of 83,175 DarkComet Remote Access Trojan (RAT) samples. Of these, 48.85% were successfully analyzed, and their configuration information was extracted. This led to the infiltration of 751 Command and Control (C&C) servers, which provided data on 109,535 unique victim computers. The collection of DarkComet bot binaries took place between August 2013 and June 2014, while the C&C server infiltration occurred from May 10, 2014, to June 6, 2014.

The study also includes a refined exploit for the QUICKUP vulnerability, previously documented, which prevents detection by botmasters and supports the downloading of large files. The document provides an in-depth analysis of the configuration data extracted from the collected malware samples, offering valuable insights into the structure and operation of the DarkComet RAT.
