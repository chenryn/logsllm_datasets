## Abstract
The HTTPS certificate ecosystem has been a subject of significant interest in both the measurement and security communities. Without a comprehensive ground truth, researchers have studied this Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) from various fragmented perspectives, including passive network monitoring, scans of popular domains or the IPv4 address space, search engines like Censys, and Certificate Transparency (CT) logs. In this work, we comparatively analyze these perspectives. We find that aggregated CT logs and Censys snapshots complement each other, encompassing over 99% of all certificates found by any of these techniques. However, they still miss 1.5% of certificates observed in a crawl of .com, .net, and .org domains. We illustrate how this combined perspective affects results from previous studies. Based on our findings, we have worked with Censys to incorporate CT log data into its results, and we recommend that future HTTPS measurements adopt this new vantage point.

## 1. Introduction
Nearly all secure web communication occurs over HTTPS. Both the underlying TLS protocol and the supporting certificate PKI have been extensively studied over the past five years, with questions ranging from understanding the behavior of certificate authorities [11, 14] to detecting server-side vulnerabilities and tracking their mitigation [7, 10, 28].

Such measurements are challenging due to the lack of a comprehensive set of trusted certificates or HTTPS websites—no ground truth for studying this ecosystem. Instead, researchers have used various fragmentary perspectives, such as scanning the IPv4 address space [12], querying popular Alexa domains, passively monitoring network traffic [3], and querying CT logs [20, 21]. Each methodology provides an imperfect view, and there has been little work to analyze how they differ or how they might be combined to form a more comprehensive picture.

For example, consider the different perspectives provided by CT logs and the Censys search engine [8], two widely used sources of certificate data. CT is designed to enable auditing of trusted certificates by recording them in publicly verifiable logs. While this may someday provide a complete view of the certificate ecosystem, publishing certificates to CT logs is currently voluntary in most cases. In contrast, Censys provides a public database of certificates collected by actively scanning the IPv4 address space and Alexa Top Million domains. Although IPv4 scanning might seem to offer an exhaustive view, it misses several important cases, including those served exclusively over IPv6. IP-based scanning also cannot provide the TLS Server Name Indication (SNI) header [13], which specifies the requested domain name and is necessary when a server hosts multiple sites from a single IP address.

In this work, we comparatively analyze the certificates seen by eight measurement perspectives: (1) a Censys certificate snapshot, (2) an exhaustive IPv4 scan on TCP/443, (3) a scan of Alexa Top Million domains, (4) a snapshot of public CT Logs, (5) a scan of domains contained in these CT logs, (6) a scan of domains contained in the .com, .net, and .org zone files [30], (7) a scan of domains from the Common Crawl dataset [6], and (8) certificates passively observed by the ICSI SSL Notary using passive network monitoring [3].

Combining these datasets, we observe nearly 17 million unique browser-trusted certificates that were valid during our measurement interval, August 29 to September 8, 2016. Of these, 90.5% appeared in public CT logs and 38.0% were seen by Censys. To understand this difference, we investigate the impact of SNI by attempting connections to 30 million domains extracted from certificates in CT logs. Only 35% of domains that accepted a connection with SNI offered the same certificate when SNI was not used. This places an upper bound on the certificates observable by IP-based scanning. Combining data from Censys and CT covers 99.4% of all trusted certificates seen by any perspective we studied, and may closely approximate the public HTTPS ecosystem.

However, to better validate the fraction of certificates visible with these perspectives, we consider certificates seen by scanning domains from the .com, .net, and .org zone files, and find that the union of CT logs and Censys contains 98.5% of them. Based on these results, we recommend that researchers performing future HTTPS measurements use a combination of data published in CT logs and Censys-style IPv4 scanning. To facilitate this, we are working with the operators of Censys to implement synchronization between Censys and CT logs. Going forward, Censys will continuously incorporate certificate data from public CT logs in its results and publish newly discovered certificates back to Google CT logs, making either data source a strong foundation for studying the certificate ecosystem.

## 2. Certificate Perspectives
To compare techniques for measuring certificates, we conducted six kinds of scans and analyzed two existing datasets. Table 1 summarizes these perspectives, which we describe in detail below.

### 2.1 Certificate Transparency Logs
Certificate Transparency (CT) aims to allow public auditing of trusted certificates [21]. Anyone can submit valid certificates to CT log servers, which record them in cryptographically verifiable public ledgers. Although there is no universal requirement for submission, Google records all certificates seen in its web crawls to CT logs. Chrome requires all issuers to submit extended validation (EV) certificates to at least two logs [5]. Chrome recently mandated that Symantec certificates signed after June 1, 2016, be submitted to be trusted as well [26]. Several CAs voluntarily log all certificates they issue, notably Let’s Encrypt [23] and StartCom [27].

We retrieved the certificates stored in twelve well-known CT logs on September 8, 2016. These logs are operated by Google (“Pilot”, “Aviator”, “Rocketeer”, and “Submariner”), Digicert, StartCom, Izenpe, Symantec, Venaﬁ, WoSign, CNNIC, and Shengnan GDCA.

### 2.2 Censys Certificate Snapshot
The Censys search engine [8] publishes daily snapshots of all the certificates it indexes. Censys collects certificates by exhaustively scanning the IPv4 address space without SNI and by connecting to all Alexa Top Million domains with SNI. Our perspective is based on the September 8, 2016 snapshot.

### 2.3 Scan of FQDNs from CT
We extracted the fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) from all certificates in our CT log snapshots, covering the common name (CN) and subject alternative name (SAN) fields. We then used ZGrab [8] to attempt an HTTPS connection to each domain, with SNI enabled. The scan ran from the University of Michigan on August 29 and September 6 and 8, 2016.

### 2.4 IPv4 HTTPS Scan
We used the ZMap suite [12] to scan the IPv4 address space for HTTPS servers listening on TCP/443. The scan took place on August 29, 2016, from the University of Michigan. For each listening host, we attempted a TLS handshake and recorded the presented certificate chain. Since these connections were based on IP addresses rather than domain names, they did not include the SNI header.

### 2.5 Authoritative Zone Files
We attempted HTTPS handshakes with all domains in the authoritative zone file [30] for .com, .net, and .org domains, for both the base domain and the www subdomain. (Since the TLD zone files contain only the name server entries for each domain, we learn only the base domain name.) We ran these scans using ZGrab on August 29 and September 2, 2016, from the University of Michigan. There were 153 million unique domains in these zone files, and we completed 42 million successful HTTPS handshakes to the base domains and 40 million successful HTTPS handshakes to the www subdomains. While we connected to many domains, the certificates served were often only valid for the hosting provider's domain name and not the scanned domain.

### 2.6 Common Crawl
The Common Crawl project [6] aims to perform a regular, complete crawl of public websites. We processed the January 2016 crawl and extracted 28.9 million unique domains. We used ZGrab to attempt an HTTPS connection to every domain on September 3, 2016, from the University of Michigan.

### 2.7 Alexa Top Million HTTPS Scan
We used the ZMap suite to attempt connections to the Alexa Top Million domains. The scan took place on September 3, 2016, from the University of Michigan. For each listening host, we attempted a TLS handshake with SNI enabled and recorded the presented certificate chain.

### 2.8 ICSI SSL Notary
The SSL Notary dataset consists of daily Internet traffic from approximately 180,000 users at five North American academic or research institutions [3]. We analyzed 2.2 billion TLS connections on TCP/443 from July 29 to August 29, 2016, extracting a total of 635,314 certificates. We excluded incomplete connections as well as HPC, Grid, and Tor certificates, resulting in 386,051 certificates, of which 256,869 were trusted by the Mozilla NSS root store.

Due to a nondisclosure agreement that limited our internal data sharing, Notary certificates are not included in cases where we consider the union of all perspectives. This reduces the size of the union by 0.02%.

In total across all these perspectives, we discovered 17 million unique certificates that were valid and trusted by the Mozilla NSS root store. Since the different datasets contain somewhat different temporal perspectives, we consider certificates to be valid only if their date ranges cover our entire collection period, August 29 to September 8. By constraining our data in this way, we ensure that no data source contains certificates that would be invalid in another data source due to the time when the certificates were validated.

### 2.9 Ethical Considerations
For our active scanning, we honored the University of Michigan’s institutional blacklist to exclude endpoints that previously requested not to be scanned. We also followed the best practices defined by Durumeric et al. [12]; we refer to that work for more discussion of the ethics of active scanning. Passive data collection was cleared by the responsible parties at each contributing institution. The ICSI SSL Notary stores connection metadata (e.g., certificate and cipher information) without collecting any connection payload.
