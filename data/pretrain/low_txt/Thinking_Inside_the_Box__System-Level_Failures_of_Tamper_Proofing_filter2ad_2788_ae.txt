In an ideal scenario, evaluations of security systems would be conducted by representatives of the end users. However, in the case of cardholders and small merchants, collective action is not feasible. When evaluation by the relying party is impractical, the next best option might be a hostile laboratory. In practice, the closest we often achieve to this ideal is an academic evaluation, such as the one presented in this paper. Unfortunately, the quantity and timeliness of these evaluations fall far short of the optimal: over 200 types of PIN Entry Devices (PEDs) have been offered for sale in Europe, yet this paper represents the first open evaluation. The question arises: why were other products not evaluated years ago?

Our experience, as discussed in this paper, and similar experiences from previous projects, may provide some insight. The industry's attitude towards independent evaluation ranges from unhelpful to actively obstructive. Most critically, merchants fear retribution from their bankers if they are discovered to have assisted in confirming security vulnerabilities. Our cooperation with merchants and other insiders has only been possible when we could protect their identity. In many ways, criminals are in a better position, as they can easily set up fake merchant accounts, take higher risks, and remain more anonymous than an independent researcher working with a legitimate merchant.

One potential solution is to leverage market mechanisms. For example, individuals who discover vulnerabilities in operating system platforms can sell this information in a thriving market, with companies like iDefense and Tipping Point buying and selling such data. However, for PED evaluations, the challenge lies in identifying the buyers of such vulnerabilities.

It appears that a certification body is inevitable in certain circumstances. If the Common Criteria are to provide the framework, the brand must be better protected. Certification bodies should register 'Common Criteria' as a trademark and enforce it rigorously, similar to how banks protect their brands. Any entity claiming that a device is 'Common Criteria Evaluated' without undergoing the full certification process should face legal action, such as having their website taken down for trademark infringement.

Given the strong incentives for vendors to seek out the most lenient evaluation labs, leading to a race to the bottom among labs, and the lack of institutional incentives for certification bodies to exercise proper discipline, we propose that evaluations of equipment on which the public relies should come with sufficient rewards to motivate independent evaluation. For an evaluation at EAL3, we suggest a mandatory reward of $10,000 for each vulnerability, and for EAL4, the reward should be $100,000.

The introduction of financial incentives will encourage a more socially optimal level of attack effort. Additionally, conditioning the rewards on responsible disclosure can control any increase in exposure. We propose that the rewards be paid not by the vendors or the evaluation labs, but by the certification bodies that license the labs. This way, careless evaluators cost their regulators real money, making them more likely to be disciplined. The certification bodies might, in turn, require vendors to post performance bonds.

**Conclusions**

Smartcard payments rely on the anti-tampering measures in PIN entry devices. Our examination of market-leading products reveals that they are inadequate in protecting cardholders. It is not enough to focus solely on the design of anti-tampering features; PED designers often put significant effort into protecting the wrong assets and appear to misunderstand the systemic aspects of attacks. This raises serious questions about the design of tamper-proof systems.

We propose an improved design methodology: complex systems should have a security architecture document to inform all participants in the design and evaluation process, and protection properties need to be traced across boundaries and interfaces to ensure they do not slip away. Systems engineering, and indeed computer science, are increasingly about managing complexity, which will be a growing concern for security engineers. EMV may serve as a good case study.

However, the failure here extends beyond the technical aspects of security engineering. Claims that terminals were 'Common Criteria Evaluated' turned out to be almost meaningless; the devices in question were not Common Criteria Certified, and the certification body was not interested in protecting its brand. If the Common Criteria brand is to have any value in the future, other than as a marketing slogan, the incentives need to be fixed.

Finally, the lessons learned are not limited to banking. Other fields, such as voting machines, suffer from the same combination of mistakes, sham evaluations, and obstructive authorities. Technology alone is not enough; regulatory reform is also necessary.
