### Future Work

We envision several directions for future research in Policy-Based Encryption Schemes (PBES):

1. **Efficiency and Practicality:**
   - **Encryption Schemes:** The efficiency of PBES can be enhanced by employing alternative encryption frameworks, such as the Tag-KEM/DEM framework [1]. This could potentially reduce computational overhead and improve overall performance.
   - **Integration and Applications:** Further exploration of the practicality of PBES can be achieved through deeper integration with power grid systems and other real-world applications, such as distributed file sharing. This will help in understanding the scalability and robustness of PBES in diverse environments.

2. **Policy Flexibility and Secrecy:**
   - **Flexible Policies:** New policy-based encryption schemes should be developed to support more flexible and dynamic policies. Additionally, these schemes should provide policy secrecy, ensuring that policies remain confidential even from key distribution centers (KDCs), which is a limitation in current PBES.
   - **Secret Policy Routing:** Another challenge is to develop schemes that allow messages to be routed based on secret policies, adding an extra layer of security and flexibility.

3. **Key Escrow and Advanced Schemes:**
   - **Key Escrow Minimization:** PBES shares the key escrow property with other cryptographic schemes, which may limit its applicability in certain scenarios. Future work should focus on developing new schemes that minimize or eliminate this limitation while still providing the desired security properties.
   - **Desirable Properties:** These new schemes should aim to maintain or enhance the desirable properties of PBES, such as policy enforcement and access control, while addressing the key escrow issue.

### Appendix A: Policy and Key Encapsulation Mechanism (PKEM)

A Policy and Key Encapsulation Mechanism (PKEM) is an encapsulation mechanism designed to encapsulate both a key and a policy. Similar to a Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM), a PKEM consists of three algorithms: `PKEM.KeyGen`, `PKEM.Encrypt`, and `PKEM.Decrypt`. However, unlike KEM, `PKEM.Encrypt` also accepts an additional bit string from the message space (interpreted as a policy) as input, and `PKEM.Decrypt` outputs both the key and the policy.

Given that a PKEM encapsulates both a key and a policy, we define two notions of indistinguishability for a PKEM against an adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (CCA2): key indistinguishability and policy indistinguishability.

#### Definition A.1: Key Indistinguishability

Let \( A = (A_1, A_2) \) be a probabilistic polynomial-time (PPT) CCA2 adversary. The guessing advantage of \( A \) is defined as follows:

\[
\text{Adv}_{\text{PKEM}, A}^{\text{pkem-key-ind-cca2}}(k) = \left| \Pr \left[ \text{Game}_{\text{pkem-key-ind-cca2}}^{\text{PKEM}, A}(k) = b \right] - \frac{1}{2} \right|
\]

where

\[
\text{Game}_{\text{pkem-key-ind-cca2}}^{\text{PKEM}, A}(k):
\]
1. \((sk, pk) \leftarrow \text{PKEM.KeyGen}(1^k)\)
2. \((St, pol) \leftarrow A_1^{\text{DEC}(\cdot)}(pk)\)
3. \(b \leftarrow \{0, 1\}\)
4. \((K_b^*, C^*) \leftarrow \text{PKEM.Encrypt}(pk, pol)\)
5. \(K^* \leftarrow K_b^*\)
6. \(b' \leftarrow A_2^{\text{DEC}(\cdot)}(pk, C^*, K^*, St)\)
7. Return \(b'\)

The oracle \(\text{DEC}(\cdot)\) is defined as \(\text{PKEM.Decrypt}(sk, \cdot)\) with the condition that the oracle rejects queries on \(C^*\) after the target ciphertext is given to the adversary.

#### Definition A.2: Policy Indistinguishability

Let \( A = (A_1, A_2) \) be a PPT CCA2 adversary. The guessing advantage of \( A \) is defined as follows:

\[
\text{Adv}_{\text{PKEM}, A}^{\text{pkem-pol-ind-cca2}}(k) = \left| \Pr \left[ \text{Game}_{\text{pkem-pol-ind-cca2}}^{\text{PKEM}, A}(k) = b \right] - \frac{1}{2} \right|
\]

where

\[
\text{Game}_{\text{pkem-pol-ind-cca2}}^{\text{PKEM}, A}(k):
\]
1. \((sk, pk) \leftarrow \text{PKEM.KeyGen}(1^k)\)
2. \((St, pol_0, pol_1) \leftarrow A_1^{\text{DEC}(\cdot)}(pk)\)
3. \(b \leftarrow \{0, 1\}\)
4. \((K^*, C^*) \leftarrow \text{PKEM.Encrypt}(pk, pol_b)\)
5. \(b' \leftarrow A_2^{\text{DEC}(\cdot)}(pk, (K^*, C^*), St)\)
6. Return \(b'\)

The oracle \(\text{DEC}(\cdot)\) is defined as \(\text{PKEM.Decrypt}(sk, \cdot)\) with the condition that the oracle rejects queries on \(C^*\) after the target ciphertext is given to the adversary.

A symmetric-key based PKEM (SPKEM) is similar to the public-key based PKEM described above, except that a symmetric key is used instead of an asymmetric key-pair. The notions of key and policy indistinguishability for SPKEM are defined similarly to those for PKEM, but they are defined for an one-time adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (OTCCA) adversary, i.e., the adversary does not get access to an encryption oracle in the first phase. We can construct an SPKEM using a Data Encapsulation Mechanism (DEM) and then build a PKEM using SPKEM and KEM as shown in Section 5.2. The SPKEM scheme of Section 5.2 is secure against OTCCA attacks on key and policy indistinguishability, as stated by the following theorems.

#### Theorem A.1

If DEM is secure against one-time adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks (OTCCA) on (message) indistinguishability, then SPKEM is secure against one-time adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks (OTCCA) on key indistinguishability. Specifically, for every PPT adversary \( A \), there exists a PPT adversary \( B \) whose running time is essentially the same as that of \( A \) such that for all \( k \in \mathbb{N} \), we have

\[
\text{Adv}_{\text{SPKEM}, A}^{\text{spkem-key-ind-otcca}}(k) = \text{Adv}_{\text{DEM}, B}^{\text{dem-ind-otcca}}(k)
\]

#### Theorem A.2

If DEM is secure against one-time adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks (OTCCA) on (message) indistinguishability, then SPKEM is secure against one-time adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks (OTCCA) on policy indistinguishability. Specifically, for every PPT adversary \( A \), there exists a PPT adversary \( B \) whose running time is essentially the same as that of \( A \) such that for all \( k \in \mathbb{N} \), we have

\[
\text{Adv}_{\text{SPKEM}, A}^{\text{spkem-pol-ind-otcca}}(k) = \text{Adv}_{\text{DEM}, B}^{\text{dem-ind-otcca}}(k)
\]
