**Sam Brannen** opened **SPR-6050** and provided the following comment:

In the Spring TestContext Framework, specifically within `AbstractGenericContextLoader`, annotation-driven autowiring is automatically enabled. This means that all `ApplicationContexts` created by subclasses of `AbstractGenericContextLoader` (e.g., `GenericXmlContextLoader`) are configured to process annotations by default.

If you explicitly do not want annotation processing to be enabled for the configuration files you specify—such as when some beans are annotated with `@Autowired` but you do not wish for those beans to be autowired—there is currently no way to disable this behavior. 

As suggested in the forum, it would be beneficial if Spring provided a mechanism to disable automatic annotation-driven autowiring in tests.
