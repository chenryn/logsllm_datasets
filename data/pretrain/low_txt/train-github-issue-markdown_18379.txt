### Electron Version
11.2.3

### Operating System
Windows 10 (x64)

### Last Known Working Electron Version
5.10.0

### Expected Behavior
When using the `fse.copy()` function to copy a file from one location to another, it should work as expected.

### Actual Behavior
In Electron version 11.2.3, the `fse.copy()` function sometimes fails to work, with no error or warning messages. It appears as if the application does not have the necessary permissions to perform the operation. This issue was not present in version 5.10.0, where the same code worked perfectly.

### Additional Information
- Not all users encounter this bug.
- Some users can temporarily resolve the issue by restarting the application, but the problem reoccurs later.
- For others, even restarting the application does not solve the problem.
- This bug has only been observed on Windows operating systems.

### Context
Our application is a book reading app. We recently updated the Electron version from 5.10.0 to 11.2.3. Since the update, we have received numerous complaints about the inability to add new books to the library. One of our team members also experienced this issue, but we were unable to reproduce it consistently. 

We have narrowed down the problem to the `fse.copy()` function. In version 11.2.3, this function occasionally fails to execute, with no errors or warnings, suggesting a potential permission issue. The same code works flawlessly in version 5.10.0.

If you need any further information or assistance, please let us know.
