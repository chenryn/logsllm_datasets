### Inconsistencies in DNS Resolution Paths

In approximately 10% of cases, inconsistencies in DNS records can create two entirely separate resolution paths for the same nameservers. Specifically, in-bailiwick domains will use the parent zone glue records, while out-of-bailiwick domains will use the child zone glue records.

### Table 12: Parent-Child Glue Record Consistency

| Domain Type | .com | ngTLDs | .net | .org |
|-------------|------|--------|------|------|
| Unresponsive | 80,554 (16.4%) | 355,055 (72.2%) | 8,322 (11.4%) | 5,742 (85.1%) |
| P = C | 32,410 (6.6%) | 40,528 (8.2%) | 3,910 (0.8%) | 2,900 (0.6%) |
| P ≠ C | 23,170 (4.7%) | 23,534 (4.8%) | 2,630 (0.5%) | 2,061 (0.4%) |

### Table 13: Popular Domains with Lame Delegations

| Alexa Rank | Measured | Fully Lame | Partly Lame |
|------------|----------|------------|-------------|
| Top 100k   | 439      | 14,483     | 82,420      |
| Top 1M     | 2,867    | 146        | 943         |

### Figure 6: Average Resolution Times

This figure shows the average times to resolve domains over a month of daily resolutions. Domains are aggregated by the percentage of lame delegated authoritative nameservers they have. For example, domains with five nameservers where three are lame fall into the “(40,60%]” bucket. The whiskers show standard deviations.

### Impact of Lame Delegation on DNS Performance

Lame delegations not only pose security risks (as discussed in Section 5.6) but also degrade DNS resolution performance. In this section, we quantify this performance impact and show that it affects even popular domains.

#### Useless DNS Queries

When resolving a domain with at least one lame delegated nameserver, a resolver may need to contact multiple nameservers to successfully resolve the domain. This results in increased average resolution times. To measure this, we used data from OpenINTEL [28] to calculate the average resolution time for approximately 49 million domains in our active measurement set over the month of March 2020. OpenINTEL performs active measurements using a normal resolver, approximating the user experience and minimizing short-term variance.

- **Fully Resolvable Domains**: Average resolution time was 172 ms.
- **Partly Lame Delegated Domains**: Average resolution time was 720 ms.
- **Fully Lame Delegated Domains**: Average resolution time was 1,743 ms, an order of magnitude higher than fully resolvable domains.

Figure 6 breaks down resolution times by the percentage of lame delegated nameservers. For example, for domains with (40,60%] lame delegated nameservers, the average resolution time was 0.59 seconds, 3.4× higher than domains with no lame delegated nameservers.

#### Lame Delegations in Popular Domains

We observed that lame delegations occurred even on popular domains. Table 13 shows the number of domains in our active measurement set that are on Alexa Top lists [4], and the number of those that were fully and partly lame. We used the Alexa list for April 13, 2020, which corresponds to the midpoint of our active measurement campaign.

For instance, `archive.org`, an Alexa Top 200 site, had one lame delegation out of five possible delegations as of September 12, 2020. Surprisingly, we also encountered fully lame delegations in popular domains. Most domains switched their nameservers soon after, remediating the lame delegation. These observations support our hypothesis that fully lame delegations are likely to be fixed more quickly than partly lame delegations because the domains become unusable when fully lame delegated.

### Ethical Considerations

We considered ethical aspects of characterizing and responsibly disclosing lame delegations. Domains with lame delegations may be at risk of being hijacked. Given the large number of at-risk nameserver domains, we cannot defensively register all of them, which would raise its own ethical issues. Without the ability to protect these domains, disclosing them increases the risk of harm to their owners and users. We are working on a responsible way to disclose our findings.

### Summary

Our study highlights the significant gap between the clean abstract model of how the Internet functions and the often messy reality of its operation. Using comprehensive collections of both active and passive DNS measurements, we found that lame delegations are surprisingly common, affecting roughly 14% of registered domains. These delegations impair DNS performance and create substantial unnecessary load on existing nameservers.

We also identified significant security risks, including the potential for attackers to hijack thousands of domains by registering a single nameserver domain. We are now working with registrars to remediate these issues and develop improved operational practices.
