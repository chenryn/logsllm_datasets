### Data Provenance in Computing

The concept of data provenance in computing was first explored in the context of database systems. These techniques aim to identify the origin of a piece of data and the processes through which it was transformed and stored in the database [13, 21, 11]. This information can be proactively added as metadata at the source and transformation points [18, 15] or reactively obtained using methods such as query inversion [58, 14]. Such techniques have been adapted and extended to other platforms, including web servers with trusted hardware [35]. The presence of these mechanisms significantly enhances the infrastructure for audits and determining data quality [34].

### Provenance in Networks

More recently, researchers have focused on providing provenance information for network data. Traceback techniques [41, 23] attempt to determine the true path of packets, even in the presence of potentially spoofed source information. This information can be added directly to the packets as metadata [41, 44, 59, 39] or by storing and querying state from within the routers themselves [61]. Additionally, watermarking tools are available to identify the provenance of flows in IP networks [56, 28, 24]. However, the diversity of telephony networks (e.g., circuit-switched PSTN, cellular, and VoIP) makes such watermarks extremely challenging. Specifically, metadata introduced in one network (e.g., watermarks, path information) is generally lost when the call is transmitted over another network.

To our knowledge, no previous work has attempted to identify the provenance of a phone call in a diverse telephony environment. However, techniques in purely Internet-based environments have been considered [46]. The closest existing solutions are caller identification (Caller-ID) services that provide the caller's number or name in PSTN and mobile networks. Calls originating from IP networks typically lack a unique associated number or name, making it difficult to identify the caller [43]. Moreover, various techniques already exist to spoof phone numbers [2].

### Call Artifacts and Provenance

Artifacts of calls themselves may provide significant provenance information. Specifically, call quality depends on a combination of the codec [31, 5], the range of end devices [12], and network degradations [16, 40, 29]. Detecting these characteristics using tools designed to measure single-ended call quality [16, 31, 40] can potentially improve the provenance of a call.

### Conclusion

Caller-ID has long been considered a reliable means of identifying the source of a call. However, this mechanism is now easily spoofable through various free and low-cost techniques. In this paper, we take a first step towards a mechanism capable of determining call provenance—the source and the path taken by a call. We leverage attributes of the audio delivered to the receiver, including characteristics of the applied codecs, packet loss profiles, and bit error rates. Our method identifies the codecs applied to incoming calls passing through up to three intermediary types of telephony networks with 91.6% accuracy. Additionally, fingerprints for specific sources were identified with between 90% and 100% accuracy, depending on the number of training sets. Through additional device-specific fingerprinting mechanisms and distance estimation techniques, we believe our mechanisms can be further improved and made more robust against attacks.
