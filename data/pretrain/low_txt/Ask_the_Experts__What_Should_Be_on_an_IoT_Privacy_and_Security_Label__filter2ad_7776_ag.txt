### Appendix A: Expert Elicitation Study

#### Interview Questions

1. **Introduction:**
   - You are probably aware that food products have nutrition labels that provide detailed nutritional information. However, when you buy an IoT device, there is no such information. We are developing a label for IoT devices that focuses on privacy and security aspects, similar to a nutrition label for foods. Today, we will discuss the factors that should be included on this privacy and security label for IoT devices.

2. **Definitions:**
   - Q: Can you define security in the context of IoT devices?
   - Q: Can you also define privacy related to IoT devices?

3. **Factors for the Label:**
   - Q: Please specify the security factors that you would want to see on the label.
   - Q: For each factor, please specify the levels or values that you think this factor should have.
   - Q: For each factor, please specify the choices consumers may be provided with by the manufacturer.
   - (We asked the same questions for privacy and general factors)

     - [ ] I have no preference toward presenting privacy and security factors (Please specify your reason(s))

10. **Suggestions for Understandability:**
    - Q: Do you have any suggestions to make the information about this factor more understandable?

### Appendix B: Consumer Study

#### Noncomparative Purchase Process

1. **Risk Communication:**
   - Q: What are the factors that you see here that seem risky to you from a security or privacy perspective?
   - [If participants specify a factor as being risky]
     - Q: What kinds of risks do you think you could be exposed to by the information conveyed by this factor? What bad things could happen as a result of this information?
     - Q: If you were looking for a camera that was like this but less risky, what would you like to see instead of the current information for this factor?
   - Q: If features, price, and the brand were all what you wanted, based on the privacy and security information of this primary layer of the label, would you purchase this device? Why?
   - Q: What are the most useful factors on this label that helped you make this decision?

2. **Label Comprehension:**
   - [First without the label, then with the label]
     - Q: I want you to please take a look at this smart security camera package. Please let me know what you can learn about the privacy and security of this device.

#### Comparative Purchase Process

1. **Comparative Decision Making:**
   - Q: Let’s say you were trying to decide whether to buy the security camera that I just showed you. The store has this other security camera, which is the same price and has the same features. However, it has slightly different privacy and security-related information, which is now being presented on the label on the package. Please take a look at these two devices and tell me:
     - Q: Why do you think one is better than the other?
     - Q: What are the things that this company has done better over the other one and why do you think they are better?
     - Q: What are the things that this company has done worse and why do you think they are worse?
     - Q: What is the most useful piece of information on this label that helped you make this decision?
     - Q: Overall, which device would you purchase? Why?

2. **Layered Label Explanation:**
   - Q: [Explain the idea of a layered label] Please scan the QR code or type in the URL on the primary layer to take a look at the secondary layer of the label.
   - Q: Except for the devices I showed you in our study, have you ever seen a product that has a layered label like we describe?
   - Q: What is your opinion on the idea of a layered label? What could be the advantages and disadvantages of a layered label as opposed to a simple label that does not have layers?

#### Information Comprehension and Risk Communication of the Secondary Layer

1. **Factor Comprehension:**
   - Q: For each presented factor in the security mechanisms/privacy practices/general information section, can you please explain what the factor means?
   - Q: How useful do you believe this factor would be in your purchase decision making?
   - Q: Do you have any suggestions to make the information about this factor more understandable?

#### Format and Layout Considerations

1. **Design Feedback:**
   - Q: Overall, what do you think about the current design consideration of separating out security mechanisms, privacy practices, and general information?
   - Q: What are the changes you would like to apply to this label to make it more usable and understandable to you and other consumers? The suggestions could be both related to the content of the label or the design of the label. Please specify your reasons for the change you proposed.
   - Q: Is there anything else that you think would be useful to have on the primary layer of the label?
   - Q: Is there anything else that you think would be useful to have on the secondary layer of the label?

#### Purchase Scenario Selection

1. **Physical Store:**
   - Q: If you were going to purchase a smart device from a physical store, where would you go?
2. **Online Store:**
   - Q: If you were going to purchase a smart device from an online store, where would you go?
3. **Most Likely Process:**
   - Q: Which one is the kind of process that you would be most likely to follow if you were to purchase a smart home device at a brick-and-mortar store? Why? When reading the scenarios, please replace HomeDepot with [physical store participants mentioned] and the online store with [online store participants mentioned].
   - Scenarios:
     1. You walk into HomeDepot and go to the smart home aisle. You find the products you are interested in and see the primary layers of the labels on the packages. You stand there looking at the packages, but you don’t go online to take a look at the secondary layer.
     2. You walk into HomeDepot and go to the smart home aisle. You find the products you are interested in and see a QR code/URL on the package. You stand there and scan the QR code/type in the URL and look up the information of the secondary layer on your phone.
     3. Before going to HomeDepot, you go online and do the comparison shopping. You come to HomeDepot already knowing which device you will buy.
     4. You do the comparison shopping online, find the product you are interested in, and purchase the device from Amazon.
     5. Something else? Please explain.

### Figure 8: Expert Elicitation and Consumer Interviews

After the expert elicitation study and specifying the content of the IoT privacy and security label based on experts’ input, we conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 15 participants who had purchased at least one smart home device. We asked interviewees questions to study how much they understand the content of our designed labels and how the presented information conveyed risk to participants.
