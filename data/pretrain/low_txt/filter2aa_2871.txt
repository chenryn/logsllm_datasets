### Who We Are
- **Hacker**
- **(Ex)Academic**
- **Specialization**: Cyber-Physical Hacking
- **Background**: Initially dragged into academia against my will, but eventually got hooked on cyber-physical hacking.

### Motivation
- **Industrial Control Systems (ICS)**, also known as SCADA, are critical to industrial operations.
- **Big Business**: ICS is a high-stakes field with significant financial implications.
- **Potential Consequences**: Physical damage, environmental pollution, and safety violations.

### Missing Piece of Knowledge

### Typical Understanding of SCADA Hacking
- **Process Impact**:
  - **Compliance Violation**: Breaching regulatory standards.
  - **Safety**: Occupational and environmental hazards.
  - **Pollution**: Environmental degradation.
  - **Contractual Agreements**: Breach of contracts.
  - **Production Damage**: Affecting product quality and production rates.
  - **Operating Costs**: Increased maintenance and operational expenses.
  - **Equipment Damage**: Overstress and violation of safety limits.

### Attack Considerations
- **Equipment Damage**:
  - Immediate concern for most.
  - Irreversible and may lead to compliance violations if it results in human fatalities.
- **Compliance Violation**:
  - Public knowledge of regulations.
  - Must be reported to authorities and investigated by responsible agencies.

### Process Control Automation
- **Example**: Thermostat control
  - **Set Point (SP)**: Desired temperature.
  - **Control Loop**: Computes control commands.
  - **Actuators**: Adjust themselves to influence process behavior.
  - **Sensors**: Measure process state.
  - **Controller Output (CO)**: Signal to actuator (e.g., valve).

### Programmable Logic Controller (PLC)
- **Functionality**:
  - Copies data from inputs to temporary storage.
  - Runs the logic.
  - Copies from temporary storage to outputs.
- **Control Logic**:
  - Graphical programming.
  - Common algorithms: PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative).
- **Field Communication**:
  - Wires run from sensors and actuators to wiring cabinets.
  - Communication media: 4-20 mA, 0-10 V, air pressure.

### IT Hacking vs. OT Hacking
- **IT Hacking**:
  - Traditional methods: 1-day exploits, clueless users, antivirus, patch management.
- **OT Hacking**:
  - Exploits vulnerabilities listed in ICS-CERT advisories.
  - Scans the internet for vulnerable devices.
  - Examples: GreHackâ€™13, Black Hat USA 2011.

### Invading Field Devices
- **Smart Instrumentation**:
  - Converts analog signals to digital.
  - IP-enabled (part of the "Internet-of-Things").
- **Attack Scenario**: Pipe damage with water hammer.

### Process Discovery
- **Espionage and Reconnaissance**:
  - Understand the equipment, process, and control structure.
  - Piping and instrumentation diagrams, ladder logic, PLC configuration.
- **Malware Example**: HAVEX, which gathers details about connected devices and sends them back to the command and control (C&C) server.

### Control Loop Configuration
- **Interdependencies**:
  - Physical components are related by the physics of the process.
  - Adjusting one parameter affects others (e.g., temperature, pressure, flow).
- **Challenges**:
  - Highly non-linear dynamics.
  - Uncertainty in process behavior beyond the control model.

### Types of Attacks
- **Step Attack**: Sudden, sustained change.
- **Periodic Attack**: Repeated, regular changes.
- **Magnitude of Manipulation**: High, medium, low.
- **Recovery Time**: Time to return to normal operation.

### Reliably Useful Controls
- **Outcome of the Control Stage**:
  - Identify controls that are reliably useful for the attack goal.
  - Avoid triggering alarms.

### Damage
- **Breaking Things**:
  - Develop attack scenarios for the final payload.
  - Input from subject matter experts is often required.
  - Use accident data from governmental agencies and plant databases.

### Measuring the Process
- **Challenges**:
  - Lack of precise sensors.
  - Information spread across multiple subsystems.
  - Control loops designed for different parameters.

### Quest for Engineering Answers
- **Precision**:
  - Engineers need precise data to compare attack effectiveness.
  - Use proxy sensors and optimization applications.

### Outcome of the Damage Stage
- **Product Loss**:
  - High, medium, low, and negligible loss categories.
  - Example: Vinyl Acetate Monomer plant.

### Clean-up
- **Socio-Technical System**:
  - Involves maintenance staff, plant engineers, and process engineers.
- **Creating Forensic Footprints**:
  - Time attacks to coincide with specific employee shifts or maintenance work.
  - Use multiple attack patterns to avoid detection.

### Final Payload
- **Components**:
  - Custom operator spoofs.
  - Waiting for unusual events.
  - Log tampering.
  - Minimal process model.
  - Accident data.
  - Forensic footprint.

### Afterword
- **State-of-the-Art ICS Security**:
  - TCP/IP protocols.
  - Just-in-time manufacturing.
  - Wireless links.
- **Food for Thought**:
  - Cost of attack can exceed the cost of damage.
  - Each process is unique, but there are common attack patterns.
  - SCADA payloads for Metasploit are just a matter of time.

### Conclusion
- **Dream Big**:
  - Evil villains from James Bond movies unite! Start building your evil lairs.
