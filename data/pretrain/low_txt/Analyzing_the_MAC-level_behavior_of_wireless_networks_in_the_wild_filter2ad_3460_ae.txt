# Contenders and Contentions in 802.11 Networks

## Figure 14: Prevalence of Different Levels of Contention
Figure 14 illustrates the prevalence of different levels of contention, computed over a busy one-hour interval from the Channel 1 trace. The left graph shows the percentage of total time spent at each contention level, while the right graph displays the percentage of packets sent at each level. The y-axes are capped at 50%.

### Packet Capture Heuristic
The packet capture rate is calculated by dividing the number of data packets in the trace by the sum of this number and the number of ACKs without corresponding data packets [11, 21]. Using this heuristic, we obtain capture percentages of 94% and 85% for the merged traces of Channel 1 and Channel 11, respectively. The corresponding nitWit estimates are 90% and 79%, respectively. While we cannot be certain without ground truth, the heuristic appears to overestimate capture. This is likely because it does not account for other patterns of missing packets, such as missing ACKs or DATA-ACK pairs, which our FSM analysis can account for using subsequent packets in the conversation.

## 5.4 Analysis with dimWit
We present sample analyses of Channel 1 of the SIGCOMM 2004 wireless environment using dimWit. These insights are enabled by Wit and cannot be gathered via simulation or testbeds, as they depend on 802.11 usage in real environments.

### Uplink vs. Downlink Reliability
Figure 13 compares the reception probability for uplink (to the AP) versus downlink transmissions for 100 randomly selected clients. The reception probabilities are often asymmetric, with uplink typically being more reliable. This result is surprising, as we expected downlink to be more reliable due to higher transmission power from APs. We speculate that uplink reliability is higher because commercial APs have better, possibly multiple, antennae that improve their decoding ability.

## Figure 15: Various Measures as a Function of the Number of Contenders
Figure 15 presents various measures as a function of the number of contenders in the network, computed over the entire Channel 1 trace.

### Offered Load was Mostly Low
Figure 14 shows histograms of each contention level for a busy one-hour interval with 260 unique clients. The left graph plots the percentage of time spent at each level, indicating that most of the time there are no nodes waiting to transmit. The right graph plots the percentage of packets sent at each contention level, showing that the system is most active at low contention levels.

### Medium Utilization
Figure 15(a) plots airtime utilization as a function of the number of contenders. Utilization is computed as the percentage of time the medium is busy with at least one transmission. We observe that the medium is poorly utilized in the common case of few contenders. This is surprising because the medium is not idle due to a lack of offered load. The theoretical utilization for a single node sending 500-byte data packets at 5.5 Mbps and receiving ACKs at 2 Mbps (with no losses) is roughly 75%, whereas we observe only 30%. This suggests that nodes often wait unnecessarily in backoff phases before transmitting.

### Reception Probability
Figure 15(b) plots the packet reception probability as a function of the contention level. We expected a decline with the number of contenders due to increased collision losses. Instead, we find that reception probability remains steady, suggesting that inherent "radio losses" were the dominant cause of packet drops. Only 0.45% of the packets in our trace had overlapping transmissions.

### Performance at High Contention Levels
Figure 15(c) shows the rates of packets transmitted and received in the network, representing the throughput. Throughput initially increases with the number of contenders and then stabilizes at five or more contenders. The MAC operates well at high contention levels, contrary to recent concerns about throughput decreases due to interactions with transmission rate adaptation [11, 21].

### Summary
Our observations suggest that the 802.11 MAC is tuned for higher contention levels than those observed in our network. It assumes most losses are due to contention and backs off in response to any loss, but most losses appear to be radio losses that do not warrant backoff. The MAC uses larger than necessary backoff intervals, resulting in inefficient medium usage for low offered loads. This indicates an opportunity for a MAC that adapts to its environment to be efficient at both low and high loads.

## 6. Related Work
Most work on measurement-driven analysis of wireless networks either uses wired network traces and SNMP logs of APs [4, 5, 7, 8, 23, 26] or instrumentation in testbed settings [2, 10, 29]. While these approaches provide useful insights, they cannot study detailed MAC layer behavior in deployed networks. Recent works have explored passive monitoring of wireless networks, but the view of a single monitor is inherently limited. Jigsaw [6] focuses on merging a large number of traces in real-time, using ad hoc rules for inferences. Our approach, inspired by formal language techniques, is more precise and general.

## 7. Conclusions
We presented Wit, a non-intrusive tool for detailed MAC-level analysis of operational 802.11 wireless networks. It merges independent views of multiple monitors into a consistent view, infers missing packets, and derives detailed performance measures. We applied Wit to a multi-monitor trace of a live network, uncovering that our network predominantly had low contention and inefficient medium utilization. The MAC appeared tuned for high contention levels, leading to unnecessary backoffs. Our work is a step towards non-intrusive methods for deep analyses of 802.11 networks.
