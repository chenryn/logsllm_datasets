## Historical Background
Election day was November 3, 2020, but the results were significantly delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as states continued to receive and count mail-in ballots in subsequent days [13]. During this time, Trump and his campaign maintained that there was widespread voter fraud [82]. Most major news outlets declared the results—Biden had obtained enough electoral votes to defeat Trump—on November 7 [46]. Sparked by a speech from Donald Trump on January 6, 2021, in which he falsely claimed he had won the election, thousands of his supporters marched to the U.S. Capitol complex, where Congress had assembled to certify the electoral result [88]. The storming of the Capitol resulted in over 140 injuries [77] and 5 deaths [22]. The certification was completed the next day, and President Biden’s inauguration was held on January 20, 2021.

On November 3, elections were also held for seats in the Senate and House of Representatives. In state and local politics, elections were held for 13 governorships in 11 states and 2 territories, as well as for state legislative chambers, attorneys general, state supreme court seats, and various referendums and ballot measures. In the state of Georgia, no Senate candidates received a majority of the vote during the first round, leading to a run-off election on January 5, 2021.

## Text Clustering Experiments
To qualitatively categorize the overall dataset, we used topic modeling and text clustering algorithms to group ads with similar content, and then created qualitative descriptions for each grouping via term frequency evaluation and manual labeling. The short-content, low-context nature of many of the ads in the dataset most closely aligns with short-text topic modeling problems [1, 16, 65], but prior work on topic modeling advertisement text specifically is minimal [35]. As such, we pursued several diverse approaches to the NLP pipeline. For tokenization and lemmatization, we experimented with three pre-processing models: NLTK [48], Stanford NLP Group’s Stanza [64], and DistilBERT [76]. Our pre-processing filtered out NLTK’s English stopword corpus along with several OCR artifacts such as "sponsoredsponsored." For topic generation, we experimented with several models and techniques: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [10, 37], Gibbs-Sampling Dirichlet Mixture Model (GSDMM) [94], DistilBERT + K-means Clustering [5, 76], and BERTopic [32]. We tested two implementations of LDA: Scikit-learn [62] and Gensim [68] with both Stanza and NLTK pre-processing. The selection of LDA parameter values to evaluate was based on results from Hoffman et al. [37]. The GSDMM model was tested on parameter values following suggestions from Yin and Wang [94] for both Stanza and GSDMM pre-processing as well. The DistilBERT model and DistilBERT pre-processing, implemented via Huggingface [92], were used to generate feature vectors for use by K-means clustering via Sklearn [62], which was tested on topic count. Lastly, BERTopic was tested on topic count as well.

To establish an approximate baseline for topic cardinality tuning and evaluation on the full deduplicated dataset, we manually labeled 2,583 unique randomly-sampled advertisements from the dataset (1.52% of the deduplicated ads), using a list of verticals that Google AdWords provides to publishers for targeting purposes [29] (e.g., “/Shopping”, “/Shopping/Apparel”, “/Shopping/Apparel/Men’s Clothing”). For each ad, we used the most descriptive label, but later collapsed the hierarchies to the second level to form larger groups. This process produced 171 unique label groups in the sample, which served as a reference for topic count selection and as test data for evaluation. After generating topics for the full deduplicated dataset, the subset of ads corresponding to those labeled manually were isolated for similarity evaluation, assuming that a good model would roughly place ads in the same product sector in the same group.
