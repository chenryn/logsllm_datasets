### Vulnerability to Our Attack

Hardened MIFARE Classic cards, such as SmartMX and MIFARE Plus, are not susceptible to previously published card-only attacks. However, they are vulnerable to the attack described in this paper. To mitigate our attack, backwards compatibility with the MIFARE Classic protocol is inherently broken. Therefore, we conclude that all MIFARE Classic-compatible cards should be regarded as plain memory cards, and system integrators can no longer trust their data's authenticity and confidentiality.

### Comparison of Card-Only Attacks

Table 7.1 below compares our attack with previous card-only attacks found in the literature.

**Table 7.1: Comparison of Card-Only Attacks**

| Attack          | [GRVS09] | [Cou09] | [CHC+14] | Our Attack |
|-----------------|----------|---------|----------|------------|
| Traces Gathered | 2        | 300     | ~1,000,000 |            |
| Compute Time    | < 1s     | < 1s    | 2-15m    | 5-10m      |
| Key Recovery    | X        | X       | X        | X          |
| PRNG Weakness   | ×        | ×       | X        | < 1s       |
| Error Code Req. | ×        | ×       | X        | 3m         |
| Total Time      | 10-20h   | ~10,000 | 6-12m    |            |

- **a**: Does not require a weak PRNG.
- **b**: Does not require the error code after a failed authentication.

### Implementation and Testing

We have fully implemented and tested our attacks in practice on various hardened MIFARE Classic cards, recovering secret keys within minutes. Additionally, we present an extensive complexity analysis with theoretical boundaries to provide a better estimate of the average running time. The only prerequisite for our attack is that a single key must be known in advance. In practice, this requirement is almost always satisfied due to the widespread use of default keys in at least one or more memory sectors.

### Notification and Collaboration

We notified the manufacturer, NXP, seven months in advance of publication and demonstrated our attack on their hardened MIFARE Classic cards. After notification, we attended several meetings to discuss the attack and its impact. Furthermore, NXP asked us to review a draft of their customer notification letter, wherein they acknowledge our work and discourage the use of MIFARE Classic-compatible technology in the future.

### Recommendations

We strongly advise system integrators to migrate away from MIFARE Classic-compatible systems and start using strong and cryptographically secure systems. There are many alternative contactless smart cards that support well-studied cryptographic algorithms and formally verified authentication protocols. However, system integrators who are absolutely unable to upgrade their infrastructure could temporarily consider the following palliating countermeasures:

1. **Deploy Hardened Cards and Diversify All Keys**: This requires the adversary to perform a different attack prior to ours, involving either eavesdropping or communication with a reader. This has to take place in a controlled environment, risking camera detection.
2. **Perform Regular Authenticity and Integrity Checks in the Back-Office**: This helps detect fraudulent transactions.
