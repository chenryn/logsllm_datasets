**Attachment A: Executive Summary**

**Purpose of the Audit:**
The purpose of this audit was to evaluate the adequacy of separation of duties for various activities in the current SAP system and to provide recommendations to ensure that any identified deficiencies are corrected for the new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system.

**Report Highlights:**

**Finding:**
Implementing effective separation of duties and ensuring well-restricted user access controls for the new ERP system will decrease vulnerabilities and risks.

**Key Points:**
- The City uses varying automated and manual processes for separating key business activities and duties among staff for high-risk activities such as payroll processing, purchase orders, check processing, revenue collections, and asset management transactions.
- Although no major concerns were found, opportunities for improvement were identified.
- The audit assessed an employee’s ability to access and perform transactions within high-risk areas and provided an understanding of where these high-risk areas are within various workflows.

**Key Recommendation:**
When implementing the new ERP system, the Administrative Services, Information Technology, and Utilities Departments should separate duties for high-risk conflicting tasks by restricting transaction codes or developing mitigating controls where conflicts cannot be avoided.

### Introduction

**Objective:**
The objective of this audit was to evaluate the adequacy of separation of duties for various activities in the current SAP system and to make recommendations to ensure that any identified deficiencies are corrected for the new ERP system.

**Background:**
An ERP system is a type of business management software that integrates key business activities of the City, such as purchasing, inventory, utilities, accounting, payroll, and information technology. SAP is the current ERP system and has been in place since 2003. The City issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) and plans to complete migrating the City’s business data and processes into a new ERP system by June 2022.

**Separation of Duties (SoD):**
SoD, also known as segregation of duties, is an internal control mechanism to reduce the risk of erroneous or fraudulent transactions, improper program changes, and the damage or destruction of computer resources. This is accomplished by separating parts of a process or activity across a department or organization. To reduce the risk of unauthorized transactions (intentional or unintentional), work responsibilities and the corresponding computer access should be segregated so that one individual does not control multiple critical stages of a process.

**Standards and Guidance:**
- **ISACA Report:** "Best Practices to Resolve Segregation of Duties Conflicts in Any ERP Environment" was used to document high-risk conflicting tasks in ERP systems and how they can be mitigated with automated separation of duties within the system.
- **GAO Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government (Sections 10.12 - 10.14):** General guidance on the role of segregation of duties for internal control and alternative control activities if separation of duties is not practical due to staffing limitations or other factors.
- **FISCAM (Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual, Sections 3.2 and 3.4):** Guidance on assessing the City’s control systems, emphasizing the importance of entity-wide policies and procedures for effective segregation of duties.
- **ACFE Report (2016):** Asset misappropriation, particularly billing schemes and check tampering, poses significant risks in ERP systems.

**Risk of Not Implementing SoD:**
In an ERP system, risks and vulnerabilities may arise from the lack of proper segregation of duties. Unintended risks often stem from granting employees excessive system authorizations by providing access to functions that are not within their official duties. Challenges can occur with the lack of resources, both financial and staffing. Therefore, planning for the division of responsibilities and reflecting it in the access privileges granted through an automated process to users of IT systems, as well as implementing manual processes to mitigate any residual risk, such as collusion, becomes necessary for the proper, efficient, and secure execution of business processes.

**SoD Responsibility:**
The responsibility for SoD in the City resides within each business process area and within the IT systems supporting their execution. An effective SoD strategy requires that each business area, with a thorough understanding of its business process and workflow, collaborates with IT to gain an understanding of the system supporting SoD so the business area can structure and help IT design ERP security around separation of duties issues, particularly in the highest-risk areas.

### Scope and Methodology

**Scope:**
We reviewed best practices for separation of duties for ERP systems and used criteria to assess the highest areas of risk to the City. This audit is intended to provide high-level guidance, and we did not review and assess SoD for all workflow processes. We only identified the highest-risk areas and made recommendations for use as the City implements the future ERP system.

**Methodology:**
To accomplish our objective, we:
- Researched and identified SoD best practices and guidance.
- Created separation of duties criteria matrices from the list of high-risk conflicting tasks in ISACA’s document, "Best Practices to Resolve Segregation of Duties Conflicts in Any ERP Environment," for six areas:
  1. Accounts Payable
  2. Payroll/Human Resources
  3. Revenue Collections
  4. Treasury
  5. Utilities
  6. Information Technology
- Identified active employees, their user profiles, and their executable transactions in SAP.
- Reviewed and analyzed conflicting tasks within the high-risk list.
- Discussed with staff any mitigating processes that address active users who have conflicting tasks.
- Determined the effectiveness of the mitigating processes, both automated and manual.
