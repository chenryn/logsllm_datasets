> - **Supported Formats for Embedding System Properties:**
>   - Embedding system properties is supported for JSON and tabular formats, including `JSON`, `MultiJSON`, `CSV`, `TSV`, `PSV`, `SCsv`, `SOHsv`, and `TSVE`.
> 
> - **Non-Supported Formats:**
>   - When using unsupported formats (e.g., `TXT` or compressed formats like `Parquet`, `Avro`, etc.), the data will still be ingested, but the system properties will be ignored.
> 
> - **Event Hub Compression:**
>   - Embedding system properties is not supported when Event Hub messages are compressed. In such cases, an appropriate error will be generated, and the data will not be ingested.
> 
> - **Tabular Data:**
>   - For tabular data, system properties are only supported for single-record event messages.
> 
> - **JSON Data:**
>   - For JSON data, system properties are supported for both single-record and multiple-record event messages. In the case of multiple records, the system properties will be added only to the first record of the event message.
> 
> - **CSV Mapping:**
>   - For `CSV` mapping, system properties are added at the beginning of the record in the order specified during the creation of the data connection. However, do not rely on this order, as it may change in future updates.
> 
> - **JSON Mapping:**
>   - For `JSON` mapping, system properties are added according to the property names listed in the [System Properties](../ingest-data-event-hub-overview.md#event-system-properties-mapping) table.
