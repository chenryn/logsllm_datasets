## Abstract

This paper addresses the challenge in credential systems where a credential owner wants to demonstrate possession of a credential to a verifier without the risk of the ability to prove ownership being transferred to the verifier. We define credential ownership proof protocols for credentials signed by standard signature schemes and propose appropriate security definitions to protect both the credential issuer and the owner against concurrent attacks. We present two generic constructions of credential ownership proofs based on identity-based encryption and identity-based identification schemes. Furthermore, we show that signatures with credential ownership proofs are equivalent to identity-based identification schemes, meaning any secure construction of one implies a secure construction of the other. Finally, we demonstrate that the GQ identification protocol can be used to create an efficient and concurrently-secure credential ownership proof for credentials signed using the RSA-FDH signature scheme of Bellare and Rogaway.

## 1. Introduction

Consider a scenario where a club issues electronic tickets entitling users to watch either a single game, multiple games, or all games in a season. For the latter two cases, the same ticket can be used multiple times, but the system must ensure that each ticket is used only once per game.

A basic credential system based on digital signatures can meet these requirements. The electronic ticket will include a message \( m \) stating the user's entitlement and a signature \( \sigma \) from the club. When the ticket is presented, the signature is verified, and if valid, the statement \( m \) is honored. To protect privacy, tickets should not be linked to individual identities, and users should be able to transfer tickets as long as the "one user, one ticket" rule is enforced.

However, this system is vulnerable to ticket cloning. Legitimate ticket holders or ticket controllers can illegally copy tickets. While protection against double spending by legitimate holders can be enforced, the system remains vulnerable to malicious controllers who can clone tickets during verification.

To address this, we propose that ticket holders prove ownership of their tickets without directly showing them. This can be achieved through a zero-knowledge (ZK) proof of knowledge (PoK) of the club's signature on the claimed message. However, ZK proofs are computationally expensive and require many communication rounds.

### 1.1 Related Work

Credential systems have been extensively studied, with various security properties tailored for different applications. Our work is closely related to Universal Designated Verifier Signature Proofs (UDVSP) introduced by Baek et al. [1]. UDVSP enables a signature holder to prove ownership to a verifier, but its security model focuses on a single credential holder without considering the security of the credential issuer. In contrast, our model ensures the security of both the credential holder and the issuer.

### 1.2 Our Contributions

We formalize the security model for a credential system, emphasizing the security of credential showing. A credential issuer signs a credential using a secure signature scheme, and a credential holder proves ownership to a verifier without revealing the actual credential. We define credential ownership proof (COP) protocols for signature schemes and provide security notions that capture the required security properties.

We present two generic constructions for COPs:
1. **Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) Based Construction:** We show that a secure IBE scheme can be used to construct a secure COP. We reduce the security of this COP to the one-wayness of the underlying IBE under chosen-ciphertext attacks (owe-id-cca), a new security notion.
2. **Identity-Based Identification (IBI) Based Construction:** We establish an equivalence between a signature scheme with a secure COP and a secure IBI scheme. We show that replacing a PoK protocol with a COP in a generic IBI construction results in security against active and concurrent attacks.

Both constructions use identity-based cryptography and provide provably-secure schemes based on standard computational assumptions in the standard model.

By providing efficient and secure COPs, we offer a practical solution to the problem of proving credential ownership while protecting the security of both the credential holder and the issuer.
