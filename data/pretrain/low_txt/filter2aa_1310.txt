# Ferdinand Schober: Historical Development and Digital Rights Management (DRM) in Gaming

## Historical Development
### Vintage Protection
- **Different DRM Approaches**: Various methods have been employed to protect games from unauthorized copying.
- **Privacy Study**: The impact of DRM on user privacy.
- **Failure Cases**: Instances where DRM failed to prevent piracy.
- **Case Studies**: Specific examples of DRM implementation and their outcomes.

### Case Study: Messing with a Gamer
- **Why are Games Cracked?**: Exploring the reasons behind game cracking.
- **Q&A**: Addressing common questions about DRM and its implications.

## Disc Layout Protection
- **Games Distributed on Floppy Disks**:
  - **Easy to Duplicate**: Floppy disks were simple to copy.
  - **Unique Disc Layout**: Custom sector and track markings.
  - **Custom Reading Method**: Specialized software or hardware required.
  - **Failure Prevents Loading**: If the disc layout is not recognized, the game won't load.
  - **Broken through Nibble Copy**: Advanced copying techniques that replicate the unique layout.

### "Feelies"
- **External Tokens for Ownership Confirmation**:
  - **Physical Dongles**: Hardware tokens.
  - **User-based Challenge/Response**: Code wheels, handbooks, etc.
  - **Failure Stops Game/Changes Behavior**: Without the correct token, the game either stops or behaves abnormally.
  - **Token Duplication**: Over time, these tokens became easier to duplicate, reducing their effectiveness.
  - **Game Add-ons**: These tokens sometimes added value as collectibles or game enhancements.
  - **Outdated Due to Digitalization and Internet**: Modern technology has made physical tokens less practical.

## CD Layout Protection
- **Games Distributed on CDs**:
  - **Same Old Problems**: Similar issues as floppy disks.
  - **Breaking Red Book Standard**: Using broken sectors and oversized discs.
  - **Prevents Standard Copy Procedure**: Non-standard layouts make copying more difficult.
  - **Failure Prevents Loading**: Incorrect copies won't run.
  - **Broken through Error-Resilient Hardware and Advanced Nibble Copy**: Techniques to bypass these protections.

## Registration Key
- **Key Value for Ownership Confirmation**:
  - **Cryptographic Algorithm**: Keys generated using complex algorithms.
  - **Required for Installation and Multiplayer Features**: Essential for accessing the full game.
  - **Broken through Reverse-Engineering and Online Databases**: Methods to circumvent key requirements.
  - **Still the First Defense**: Despite vulnerabilities, registration keys remain a primary protection method.

## Code Obfuscation
- **All Copy Protection is Useless if Game Code Can be Changed**:
  - **Obfuscate Binaries**: Making the game code harder to understand and modify.
  - **Custom Solutions Pre-2000**: Early methods were often custom-made.
  - **Middleware Post-2000**: Added as part of system components.
  - **De-obfuscation and Patch Possible (Cracks)**: Skilled crackers can still reverse-engineer and patch the code.

## Networked DRM
- **Combining Multiple Protections**:
  - **Disc Layout, Registration Key, Code Obfuscation**: Integrating various methods.
  - **Online Registration Requirement**: Often limits the number of installations.
  - **Can Still be Removed, but Raises the Bar**: More sophisticated, but not foolproof.

## Social DRM
- **Eliminates Physical Distribution**:
  - **Downloads Only**: Digital distribution.
  - **Content Protection Built-in**: Integrated into the game.
  - **Adds User Identity, Payment Information, Social Network, and Online Requirement**.

## DLC (Downloadable Content)
- **Additional Game Content for Purchase**:
  - **Tied to Game Registration and User Account**: Ensures only legitimate users access the content.
  - **Obfuscation**: Additional layers of protection.

## Common DRM Systems
- **StarForce, CD Checks, LaserLock, Mixed, SafeDisc, DiscGuard, SecuROM, FADE, TAGES, EA DRM, Ubisoft DRM**.

## Content Delivery Platforms
- **Steam, GfW Live, BattleNet, Stardock, Walled Garden (iPhone, Xbox Live, PS Network)**.

## Intended Protection
- **CD/DVD Layout, Code Obfuscation, Registration Key**: Combined to prevent duplication.
- **Added as Middleware and System Components**: To ensure local copies are controlled.
- **Local OS Modifications, Driver Installations, Local Data Storage**: Enhancing security measures.

## Advances in Computing and Technology
- **Digital Reproduction, Binary Analysis, Hardware, Internet**: All contribute to breaking copy protection.
- **Copy Protection Relies on Error-Case Functionality**: Removal is possible with advanced tools and techniques.

## Privacy and Monitoring
- **Unique Machine Identification/User ID, Machine Fingerprint, Network Usage Exposures**:
  - **Install/Startup and Runtime Monitoring**: Tracking when users start and play games.
  - **Next Big Thing: Content Execution**: Future trends in DRM.

## Case Studies
- **SecuROM DRM**:
  - **Online Registration, Installation Limit, No Uninstall Tool, Phones Home**.
  - **September 2008**: Most pirated game ever, available on BitTorrent before release, 90% 1-Star ratings on Amazon.
  - **December 2008**: Uninstall tool released.

- **TAGES DRM**:
  - **Online Registration, Installation Limit, Server Overwhelmed by Steam Sale**.
  - **December 2009**: Many legal installations failed during the holidays.

- **Ubisoft DRM**:
  - **Permanent Network Connection, Reset to Checkpoint on Disconnect, Cloud Saves**.
  - **March 2010**: Authentication server failures, single player users locked out.
  - **April 2010**: Further authentication server failures, multiplayer nearly unplayable.
  - **June 2010**: Australian players locked out at release time.

## Social Networking and Privacy
- **Achievements, Game History, Content Delivery, Payment, Built-in Content Protection**.
- **User Account Information, Personal Information, Payment Information, Purchase History, Friend Network**.
- **Facebook Integration, Gaming Behavior Profiles, MP vs. SP, Casual vs. Hardcore, Online Time, Gaming Location**.

## Network Connection Issues
- **Anti-Virus and Firewalls, Bandwidth, Reliability, Direct Attacks**:
  - **Local Network Traffic Saturation, Wireless Traffic Injection, Server DDoS Attack**.
  - **Registration Keys and Accounts Vulnerability**: Stealing and generating keys, password guessing, account compromises.

## Conclusion
- **Free Stuff is Always Good, But DRM Can Be a Severe Nuisance**.
- **Privacy and Policy Concerns**: Gamers worry about data exposure.
- **What if DRM Servers Go Offline?**: Impact on vintage gaming and emulators.

This structured and detailed overview provides a comprehensive look at the historical development and current state of DRM in the gaming industry.
