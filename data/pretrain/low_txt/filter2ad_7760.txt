## Abstract

Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies secure a decentralized consensus protocol through incentives. Miners, the protocol participants, generate blocks containing monetary transactions and receive newly minted currency and transaction fees as rewards. Due to blockchain bandwidth limits, users often pay higher fees to prioritize their transactions. However, most prior research has focused on models where fees are negligible. Carlsten et al. [1] postulated in CCS'16 that if incentives come only from fees, a mining gap would form, where miners avoid mining when available fees are insufficient.

In this work, we analyze cryptocurrency security in realistic settings, considering all elements of expenses and rewards. We introduce the "gap game" to study the conditions under which gaps form, using a combination of symbolic and numeric analysis tools across various scenarios. Our analysis confirms Carlsten et al.’s postulate, showing that gaps form even before fees become the sole incentive. Surprisingly, different miners choose different gap sizes to optimize their utility, even with identical operating costs. This phenomenon can lead to reduced system decentralization and increased centralization, posing significant security risks.
