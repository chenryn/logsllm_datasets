### Control Messages and Bandwidth Considerations

Control messages, particularly triggers, do not need to be large. We believe that even with low bandwidth, most scenarios will be adequately supported. To compensate for the low transmission rate, these messages can be transmitted over extended periods, such as during an entire TV program or multiple occurrences of the same program. One way to enhance bandwidth is to use multiple channels simultaneously. For example, messages can be delivered in parallel through both the audio and light channels while watching TV. We believe the bandwidth limitations are inherent in the design of sensing-enabled channels. This represents a trade-off when using these channels for undetectable command and control compared to traditional wired or wireless channels.

### 6.2 Possible Defense Mechanisms

Although it may be challenging to detect and prevent out-of-band command and control, we recognize this as an important issue worthy of further investigation. To address this, we propose several preliminary defense mechanisms.

#### Intrusion Detection on Mobile Phones

An intrusion detection application running on the mobile phone can monitor sensor-based signaling and prevent malware from receiving commands by analyzing the sensor data stream. We envision two approaches:

1. **Virtualization Layer:**
   - Instead of giving applications direct access to sensors, a virtualization layer can be created between the sensors and the applications. This layer includes a monitor that continuously analyzes sensor accesses and data streams to detect any malicious activity.
   - The virtual sensor monitor can use machine learning techniques to determine the natural behavior of benign applications for a given user.
   - The downside of this approach is that it may be resource-intensive and requires monitoring a large number of sensor readings.

2. **Random Sensor Sampling:**
   - To determine if a malicious signal is present in the sensor readings, the phone can take random sensor samples and analyze them.

#### Power Consumption Monitoring

Another defense mechanism could be based on the power consumption of applications accessing sensors. A malicious application listening to one or more sensors is likely to consume slightly more power than other applications (see Table 5). The feasibility of such a defense against malware is demonstrated in [23]. A related approach using memory footprints [21] can also be used to detect stealthy mobile malware applications.

#### External Media Stream Monitoring

Finally, another line of defense is to monitor external media streams for malicious communication. Service providers can monitor media streams such as radio, music, or video before transmission. These mechanisms can be effective against some attack scenarios, such as the use of TV or radio programs. However, detecting steganographic channels may be very difficult.

### 7. Related Work

The most closely related work to ours is the Bluetooth-based command and control architecture proposed in [46]. In this approach, Bluetooth is used as the primary means of communication between the botmaster and infected devices. A hybrid approach is suggested, where a set of seed nodes first communicate with the botmaster over traditional networks (such as SMS), and then relay the messages to other nodes in close physical proximity via Bluetooth. Based on public Bluetooth traces, [46] demonstrated the feasibility of such an infrastructure. However, it exhibits high latencies, with messages reaching about 70% of infected devices within 24 hours. While some of our channels also have similar latencies, many others offer almost real-time delivery to a large number of devices without relying on traditional infrastructure.

HumaNet [8] is a similar architecture to that proposed in [46], but it delivers command and control messages only via phone-to-phone ad hoc communication (such as Bluetooth or WiFi ad hoc mode). This work also showed similar latencies. Our paper focuses on out-of-band communication of various types, including phone-to-phone communication in some cases.

SkyNET [42] uses compromised personal networks (such as personal WiFi) for command and control message dissemination. Other mobile botnets have been reported in scientific publications that use services like SMS/MMS [13, 19, 37, 49, 50] and open WiFi networks [26]. Our work, however, utilizes out-of-band communication channels that are much harder to detect compared to cellular or WiFi services.

The explicit use of steganography for undetectable command and control, as employed in our stego audio channel, is in line with Stegobot [39]. Stegobot uses social networking-based steganographic channels, specifically image steganography, to achieve this goal. In contrast, our steganographic audio channel embeds covert messages that are transmitted in real-time over the air, rather than into static files or images.

Out-of-band communication has been used in many security applications, including proximity-based secure association of personal wireless devices [20, 22, 27, 28] and user authentication [43]. Besides identifying a new application of out-of-band communication, i.e., undetected command and control, we have proposed many novel channels not previously explored.

### 8. Conclusion

The threat of mobile malware is rising rapidly. According to a recent report by Lookout Security [3], Android phone users are becoming increasingly vulnerable to malware. In several cases, legitimate applications were repackaged with malware code and distributed via the official Android app store or through updates/advertisements. Android and iPhone botnets have already been proposed [37, 49], and some have even appeared in the wild [49]. However, most of these mobile botnets use SMS or the Internet to build their command and control infrastructure, making them detectable via traditional botnet defense mechanisms.

In this paper, we investigated the feasibility of sensing-enabled covert channels in mobile phones. Malware using such channels will be very difficult or impossible to detect using traditional means because they exploit non-network air-gaps to communicate. Our proof-of-concept prototype demonstrates this emerging problem—using off-the-shelf hardware and popular Android-based mobile phones, we were able to send surreptitious command and control messages without using any wireless or cellular networks. Our prototype malware application received messages embedded in music, video, household lighting, or magnetic fields.

Malware with the capability to use such sensor-based covert channels can also open up new threats, such as the creation of localized botnets and geo-targeted attacks, which we explored briefly in the paper.
