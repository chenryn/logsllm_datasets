## Brief History of Telephone Switching

### Manual Cordboards
- **Labor-intensive**

### Step / Panel / Crossbar Switches
- **Electromechanical**
- **Simple and effective, but limited in function**
- **Expensive to maintain**

### No. 1 / 1AESS
- **Electronically-controlled analog switching**
- **Wider array of services available**
- **More flexibility than electromechanical switches**
- **Still in use today in North America**

### 4 ESS / 5 ESS / DMS
- **Digital time-division switching**
- **Greatly increased flexibility and service offerings**
- **Much cheaper to maintain than previous systems**
- **Huge and expensive**

## Part I: Asterisk Overview

### What is Asterisk?
- **Free, open-source PBX that runs on Linux**
- **Originally written by Mark Spencer, now supported by a large community of contributors**

### Why Asterisk?
- **Cost-effective**: Free to use, reducing expenses compared to traditional PBX vendors.
- **Runs on commodity PC hardware**
- **Broad support for VoIP protocols and hardware**
- **Easy to interconnect with other systems**: Form your own VoIP network.
- **Highly configurable**: Tailor it to your specific needs, including writing custom code.
- **Limitations**: It does not perform non-telephony tasks like dishwashing.

### Asterisk Hardware Requirements
- **Minimal requirements**: Can run on outdated hardware (e.g., 133MHz Pentium I with 16MB RAM).
- **Performance**: Supports up to 3 concurrent SIP calls before quality degrades.
- **Modern hardware**: A 2.4 GHz P4 with 512 MB RAM can handle up to 790 simultaneous calls.

### Sample Asterisk Installation
- **Asterisk Console**
- **Web Interface**
- **Mail Server**
- **NAS (Network Attached Storage)**
- **Catsex (Custom Application)**

### Popular VoIP Telephones
- **Cisco 7960**: $250-$300
- **Polycom IP600**: $250-$300
- **Grandstream BudgeTone 100**: $40-$75
- **Snom 190**: $175-$250

### Popular VoIP Terminal Adapters
- **Digium IAXy**: $100
- **Sipura SPA-2002**: $70
- **Grandstream HandyTone 286**: $65
- **Cisco ATA-186**: $50-$125

### Digium Zaptel Cards
- **TDM400P**: Connects analog telephones and lines to the Asterisk box.
- **TE405P / TE410P**: Connects four T1/E1 circuits or channel banks to the Asterisk box.

## Interconnecting Asterisk: Signaling Protocols

### Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
- **Signaling protocol only**: Media transport handled by RTP.
- **Developed by IETF**: Uses URLs instead of telephone numbers.
- **Intended as peer-to-peer**: Widely used in VoIP phones and terminal adapters.
- **NAT issues**: Does not work well with NAT without additional configuration.

### H.323
- **Developed by ITU-T in 1996**: More similar to traditional telephony signaling.
- **Uses RTP for media transport**: Used internally by interexchange carriers.
- **Unpopular in DIY VoIP**: Difficult to implement and configure correctly.

### Inter-Asterisk EXchange (IAX)
- **Developed by Mark Spencer of Digium**: Covers both signaling and media transport.
- **Streamlined and simple**: No NAT traversal issues, uses UDP on port 4569.
- **Well-supported by Asterisk**: Rare in terminal equipment, except for Digium IAXy.
- **Preferred by many PSTN termination providers**.

### Other Protocols
- **Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP)**
- **Cisco's Skinny Client Control Protocol (SCCP)**

## Interconnecting Asterisk: Codecs

### Digital Audio Basics
- **Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM)**
- **Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)**
- **µ-law and A-law Companding**
- **Differential Pulse Code Modulation (DPCM)**
- **Adaptive Differential PCM (ADPCM)**
- **Linear Predictive Coding (LPC)**

### Voice on the PSTN
- **64 kbps synchronous bandwidth for wireline telephones**: µ-law in North America, A-law elsewhere.
- **4 to 13 kbps for mobile phones**: Various codecs, often resulting in lower audio quality.

### Costs of Speech Compression
- **Increased CPU power for transcoding**
- **Compatibility issues**: Not all devices support the same codecs.
- **Licensing requirements**: Some codecs require licensing.
- **Audio quality degradation**: Music and certain words may be difficult to understand.

### Benefits of Speech Compression
- **Reduced bandwidth usage per call**

### Codecs Supported by Asterisk
- **G.711**: 64 kbps µ-law or A-law companding.
- **G.726**: 32 kbps ADPCM.
- **G.729**: 8 kbps CS-ACELP, requires a license.
- **GSM**: 13 kbps RPE-LTP.
- **iLBC**: 13.3 kbps LPC, used by Skype.
- **Speex**: 13.3 kbps CELP, open-source codec.
- **LPC10**: 2.4 kbps LPC, very low quality.

### Codec Comparison Audio Demo
- **Music**: Redeye Flight - “Natalie” (band from Los Angeles – they're cool – go see their shows)

### Interconnecting Asterisk: PSTN Termination

#### NuFone
- **Pros**: Cheap rates, geared for Asterisk, spoofable CallerID, easy provisioning, reliable call completion.
- **Cons**: Michigan DIDs only, not phreak-friendly, disabled Caller ID spoofing during DC12.

#### Asterlink
- **Pros**: Reliable, inbound via toll-free numbers, delivers ANI II, proper call progress.
- **Cons**: Kludgy account management interface.

#### Voicepulse Connect
- **Pros**: Unlimited incoming minutes on inbound IAX calls, inbound numbers in many rate centers, proper call progress.
- **Cons**: Expensive for outbound PSTN call termination.

#### VoipJet
- **Pros**: Very cheap (1.3 cents per minute).
- **Cons**: Unreliable Caller ID, no incoming service, no proper call completion.

#### BroadVoice
- **Pros**: Cheap DIDs, run by phone phreaks, 24/7 phone support, Caller ID with name.
- **Cons**: SIP only, prone to service outages, slow phone support, inconsistent CNAM.

## Interconnecting Asterisk: Network Design

### ENUM / E.164
- **Based on DNS**: Allows any number to be queried, bypassing the PSTN to save money.
- **Designed by ITU**: Officially supposed to be used by Telcos, but not widely adopted yet.

### DUNDi - Distributed Universal Number Discovery
- **Designed by Digium**: Fully peer-to-peer E.164 solution.
- **Easily set up your own telephone network with friends**: DIY alternative to waiting for E.164 implementation.

### Quality of Service (QoS)
- **Ensure calls receive enough bandwidth and low latency**: Use priority queueing and bandwidth shaping.
- **Residential routers**: Many are VoIP-aware and do a decent job out-of-the-box.
- **Cisco routers**: Can be configured for large-scale QoS or for control freaks.

## Part II: Extending Asterisk

### AGI - Asterisk Gateway Interface
- **Allows integration with external applications**: Extend Asterisk's functionality beyond its built-in capabilities.
