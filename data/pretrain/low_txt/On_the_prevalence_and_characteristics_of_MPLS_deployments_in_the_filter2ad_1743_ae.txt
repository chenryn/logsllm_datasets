### 4.3 Unlabeled MPLS Path Estimation

In this section, we evaluate the performance of our method on prior Ark data that lacks MPLS labels. We train our classifier using a subset of labeled data from June 2008 and then test it on earlier months (March, April, and May 2008) for which we do not have ground truth. Our results are presented with respect to the four most frequently encountered Autonomous Systems (ASes) in our training set.

**Table 3: Comparison of Estimated Percentage of MPLS Paths for Unlabeled Ark Data**

| Month | AS 7018 | AS 6389 | AS 4134 | AS 4230 |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 03/08 | 54.2%   | 35.5%   | 8.5%    | 0.4%    |
| 04/08 | 67.5%   | 27.0%   | 3.1%    | 7.1%    |
| 05/08 | 66.4%   | 29.8%   | 8.1%    | 35.5%   |
| 06/08 | 69.5%   | 29.4%   | 70.7%   | 25.8%   |

The table shows the percentage of paths for each AS that we estimate to include an MPLS tunnel. The results are consistent with the labeled June 2008 data, indicating that our inference method is reliable. The variability in our inference is also consistent with the variability observed in the labeled MPLS data.

Although the pre-June 2008 data does not contain uniform-mode MPLS labels, we can still examine paths that appear in both the unlabeled pre-June 2008 data and the labeled June 2008 data. Using the June 2008 MPLS labels as ground truth, we can assess the performance of our inference methodology on the intersection of these two datasets.

**Figure 19: Comparison of MPLS Path Detection for Unlabeled Data Using June 2008 Labels**

- **Left:** March 2008 Ark Dataset
- **Center:** April 2008 Ark Dataset
- **Right:** May 2008 Ark Dataset

As expected, the classifier performs more accurately for time frames closer to the labeled set (i.e., May 2008) compared to more temporally distant sets (i.e., March 2008).

### 5. Related Work

The literature on MPLS can be categorized into three main areas:

1. **Expanding and Enhancing MPLS:**
   Studies in this category focus on improving and extending MPLS beyond its original specifications. Examples include methods for enhancing reliability and fault tolerance [15, 25] and extensions for various types of label-switched paths, such as photonic networks (GMPLS [11]) and wireless networks [23].

2. **Operational Objectives:**
   This category includes studies that describe how MPLS can be used to meet specific operational goals within a network infrastructure. A prominent example is the use of MPLS for traffic engineering [17, 37].

3. **Routing Algorithms:**
   These studies explore new routing algorithms that can be used in conjunction with MPLS to establish paths with desired characteristics [35].

The details of the MPLS protocol are documented in various RFCs, which can be found on the IETF’s MPLS working group homepage [3]. The primary architectural reference is RFC 3031 [31], and the most relevant standard for our study is RFC 4950, which defines ICMP extensions for returning label stacks to clients [12]. Davie and Rekhter's comprehensive textbook [16] provides a broad overview of MPLS, and there are numerous online resources and notes on practical aspects of MPLS configuration and management [34].

To our knowledge, no prior studies have focused on the Internet-wide deployment characteristics of MPLS. The most relevant empirical studies were conducted by Sherwood et al. [32, 33]. Their work describes methods for measuring router-level topologies, including the discovery of MPLS nodes using ICMP extensions. Our study differs in its specific focus on MPLS and the longitudinal characterization of its deployment.

### 6. Summary and Conclusions

MPLS offers significant advantages for traffic engineering, multi-service networks, and improved network robustness. In this paper, we present a longitudinal study of the prevalence and characteristics of MPLS deployments in the open Internet. Our goal is to establish a comprehensive baseline for the evolution and current status of MPLS deployments, which have important implications for quality of service and network neutrality. We use the large traceroute archive from the Ark project, which has included MPLS label stacks over the past three years, enabling direct evaluation of uniformly configured MPLS tunnels. We note that our direct observations likely underestimate MPLS deployments due to the inability to empirically identify pipe-mode tunnels.

Our analysis reveals an increasing trend in MPLS deployments over the past three years, with widespread use by tier-1 providers. This suggests that packets are increasingly likely to encounter MPLS tunnels on end-to-end paths. We also find that tunnels typically span the entire edge-to-edge distance of a transit provider, with typical transit times on the order of tens of milliseconds. Additionally, our examination of traffic classifiers indicates that while multiple classes are not uncommon, the diversity of classes has remained stable over the past three years.

We developed an MPLS tunnel inference method based on the observation that RTTs for internal hops in certain configurations will be similar. Our method uses Bayesian data fusion to efficiently identify MPLS paths based on RTTs. Using labeled data, we demonstrate that this method can identify MPLS paths with high accuracy.

In future work, we plan to investigate MPLS deployments in additional traceroute data archives using our Bayesian inference method. A short-term target is the Skitter dataset, which would allow us to examine MPLS deployments over a longer time period. We also plan to expand our survey by conducting more targeted investigations using distributed infrastructures such as Planetlab.
