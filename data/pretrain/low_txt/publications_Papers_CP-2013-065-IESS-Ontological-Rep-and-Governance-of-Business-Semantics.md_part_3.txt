### Label of Provider or Integrator

For a compliant orchestration, every action that constitutes a service must clearly define the detailed roles and responsibilities of actors, as well as the required competencies. To achieve this, an Operant Resource acting in a service plays the role of a designated Actor with the permission to perform specific actions. We adopt an SVBR-featured deontic rule to define these permissions.

- **Actor**: An Operant Resource.
- **Permission**: It is permitted that the Actor performs the Action.

We can use the widely-adopted RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) roles to define specific responsibility assignments and establish four relationships:

- **Responsible**: The Actor is responsible for the Action.
- **Accountable**: The Actor is accountable for the Action.
- **Consulted**: The Actor is consulted about the Action.
- **Informed**: The Actor is informed of the Action.

These relationships may imply certain combinations of the earlier introduced permissions. We can further exclude specific combinations of roles and actors using the following SBVR syntax:

- **Exclusion**: No Actor is both responsible for and consulted about the same Action.

Alternatively, we can state implications of roles for inferencing purposes:

- **Implication**: If an Actor is responsible for an Action, it is always true that the Actor is also informed of that Action.

### Competency

A Competency is modeled as a special type of Operand Resource controlled by an Individual. The HR-XML consortium proposed a Reusable Competency Definition (RCD) as: "a specific, identifiable, definable, and measurable knowledge, skill, ability, and/or other deployment-related characteristic (e.g., attitude, behavior, physical ability) which a human resource may possess and which is necessary for, or material to, the performance of an activity within a specific business context."

Thus, we devise the following concept types:

- **Competency**: An Operand Resource.
- **Subtypes of Competency**:
  - Attitude
  - Knowledge
  - Skill
  - Learning Objective

There are many open RCD repositories that can be adopted for this purpose, such as:

- **HR-BA-XML**: Official German extension of Human Resource XML.
- **SOC**: Standard Occupational Classification System.
- **BKZ**: Occupation Code (German version of SOC).
- **NAICS**: North American Industry Classification System.
- **WZ2003**: German classification for economic activities.

### Application of the Ontology

We demonstrate the modeling of business semantics in the context of service-oriented Information Governance. These applications have been implemented in Collibra’s Business Semantics Glossary product.

#### Modeling Service System Perspectives

SBVR and BSM acknowledge the existence of multiple perspectives on how to represent concepts (by means of vocabularies) and include the modeling of a governance model to reconcile these perspectives (as practically necessary) to arrive at an ontology that is agreed upon and shared (by means of communities and speech communities).

- **Semantic Community**: A group of Organizations that controls a shared body of business service semantics. Domain concepts are identified by a URI.
- **Speech Community**: A subset of Organizations from a semantic community that control a set of vocabulary Resources to refer to the shared meanings.
- **Vocabulary**: A meaningful grouping of lexical Resources (e.g., noun types, fact types, and rules primarily drawn from a single natural language or jargon) to represent conceptions within a body of shared semantics.

The participation of Individuals in the governance of the vocabulary controlled by their Organization is constrained by specific governance services. These services are defined as domain specializations of our upper-level model by assigning Actor roles to Individuals for certain actions on these Lexical Resources.

#### Dynamic Actor Type Management

Types of Actors can be dynamically defined as a noun concept with a gloss in a designated Actor Vocabulary. For example:

- **Business Steward**: An Actor, where the term is mapped to the gloss: "expert in a certain business unit or line of business."
- **Permission**: It is permitted that the Business Steward performs the AddNounConcept action, one of many actions that can be performed on vocabulary Resources.

#### Assigning Individuals to Actor Types

Based on their Competency, Individuals are assigned to an Actor type, permitting or obligating them to play a role in a specific Action. The following screenshot shows an assignment of a role for the business semantics management of a service called “Data Governance Council” in a financial service company.

**Figure 1**: Assigning Individual “Bob Brown” to play an Actor role in a specific Vocabulary for a “DG Council” service. This implies a number of permissible Actions on the vocabulary’s constituents.

### Discussion and Conclusion

We propose a method for ontological representation and governance of business service semantics. Currently, no commercial tool, aside from the prototype in Collibra’s Business Semantics Glossary used to demonstrate the feasibility of our solution, exists. Therefore, our effort paves the way towards the development of improved service-integration tools better equipped to facilitate inter-silos communication. The next step is to investigate the automatic configuration of roles and responsibilities along peers in modeling quality and compliance of their services, by matching competency and reputation profiles, based on earlier work [7].

We will validate our approach in the Flanders research Information Space (FRIS) case study [16]. FRIS is a knowledge-intensive community of interest for two main reasons:

1. **Participatory Characteristics**: It exhibits characteristics typical of open networks, with inter-dependent yet highly autonomous, heterogeneous, and distributed actors, including research institutes, funding agencies, patent offices, and industrial adopters. The FRIS community has a minimal level of governance, and the Flemish Public Administration has limited means to enforce information quality and compliance requirements on its FRIS peers, assuming a high level of trust. However, inter-dependency on value creation is a main incentive.
2. **Information Space**: The FRIS information space itself is a true product of open value co-creation. FRIS publishes information about innovation-related entities such as researchers, projects, proposals, publications, and patents, provided and consumed by all actors. FRIS will also benefit from external (Open Data) sources, making the discussion of quality and compliance even more complex.
