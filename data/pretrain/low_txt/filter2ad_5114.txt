## Abstract
The "Attacks and Solutions in Hardware Security" (ASHES) workshop covers all aspects of hardware security, including recent attacks and solutions. It encompasses mainstream research in hardware security as well as new, alternative, or emerging application scenarios such as the Internet of Things (IoT), nuclear weapons inspections, satellite security, and consumer and supply chain security. The workshop also highlights special-purpose hardware and novel methodological solutions, such as lightweight, small, low-cost, and energy-efficient devices, and even non-electronic security systems. Additionally, ASHES welcomes theoretical works that systematize and structure the field, as well as "Wild-and-Crazy" (WaC) papers that introduce seminal ideas at an early conceptual stage.

## CCS Concepts/ACM Classifiers

## Keywords
Hardware security, secure design, special purpose hardware, hardware attacks, Internet of Things, non-electronic security hardware, emerging application scenarios for security hardware

## 1. Introduction and Motivation
As predicted by Gartner in 2015, there will be around 21 billion hardware devices connected in the IoT by 2020, generating approximately $3 trillion in annual spending. This makes the IoT and associated hardware security one of the most significant and impactful endeavors of this century.

However, the development of suitable hardware security strategies lags behind the rapid expansion of the IoT. While the security community recognizes that traditional methods do not easily transfer to hardware in an IoT setting, no fully convincing substitute strategies have been developed yet. This leads to a host of novel questions that cannot be addressed by existing means and methods alone. A particular scientific challenge lies in the unprecedented threat landscape of the IoT, which will connect billions of pervasive, low-cost devices with limited tamper-protection and computational resources.

Pressing questions include:
- How can we securely distribute individual cryptographic keys to billions of low-cost hardware devices?
- How can we securely identify low-cost hardware over digital channels, especially in systems without digital signal processors or devices powered by scavenged energy?
- How can we protect against tampering and side-channel attacks in low-cost hardware?
- How can we remotely verify the functionality and integrity of connected IoT devices?
- How can we ensure long-term confidentiality of communications with resource-constrained hardware?
- How can we protect the IoT and its hardware against malware and network attacks?
- How can we enable secure physical data storage in lightweight hardware systems?
- How can we preserve user privacy in pervasive IoT scenarios?

This workshop aims to foster solutions for these and other impending issues in hardware security, particularly with a focus on new methods and application scenarios like the IoT. It provides the CCS community with a dedicated, specialized forum for this type of research, covering both mainstream and novel approaches to support innovation in the field.

## 2. Topics
ASHES covers the entire range of established hardware security research but particularly focuses on fostering novel and innovative approaches and emerging application areas. Topics include, but are not limited to:
- Tamper sensing and protection
- Physical attacks (fault injection, side-channels, etc.), including new attack vectors or methods
- Biometrics and hardware security
- Physical unclonable functions (and new/emerging variants)
- Device fingerprinting and hardware forensics
- Item tagging, secure supply chains, and product piracy
- Use of emerging computing technologies in security (including quantum techniques)
- New designs and materials for secure hardware
- Nanophysics and nanotechnology in hardware security
- Hardware Trojans and countermeasures
- Lightweight protocols and cryptographic primitives
- Security of reconfigurable and adaptive hardware platforms
- Sensors and sensor networks
- Hardware security in emerging application scenarios: IoT, smart home, automotive, wearable computing, pervasive and ubiquitous computing, etc.
- Scalable hardware solutions for large numbers of players/endpoints
- Formal categorization, surveys, and systematization of knowledge papers

## 3. Paper Categories
To accommodate the special scope of the workshop and the rapidly developing nature of hardware security, ASHES offers four categories of papers:

### Full Papers
- Up to 10 pages in ACM double-column format (including references and appendices)
- 25-minute presentation timeslot (including questions)

### Short Papers
- Up to 6 pages in ACM double-column format (including references and appendices)
- 15-minute presentation timeslot (including questions)

### Wild and Crazy (WaC) Papers
- 3 to 6 pages in ACM double-column format, with additional appendices and references up to 6 pages
- 15-minute presentation timeslot (including questions)
- WaC papers target groundbreaking new methods and paradigms for hardware security, focusing on novelty, potential impact, and plausibility of argumentation rather than full demonstration or implementation
- Titles must include the prefix "WaC:"

### Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) Papers
- Up to 12 pages in ACM double-column format (including appendices and references)
- 25-minute presentation timeslot (including questions)
- SoK papers evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge, fostering and structuring the development of a particular subarea within hardware security
- Titles must include the prefix "SoK:"
