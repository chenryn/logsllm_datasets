| Malicious AS Type | 1 Proxy | 5 Proxies | 9 Proxies | 13 Proxies | 17 Proxies |
|-------------------|---------|-----------|-----------|------------|------------|
| Any               | 0.00 (0%) | 0.00 (0%) | 0.04 (10%) | 0.05 (6%) | 0.01 (1%) |

| Malicious AS Type | 1 Proxy | 5 Proxies | 9 Proxies | 13 Proxies | 17 Proxies |
|-------------------|---------|-----------|-----------|------------|------------|
| Top-Tier Only     | 0.01 (1%) | 0.02 (2%) | 0.02 (2%) | 0.02 (3%) | -0.01 (-2%) |
| Any               | 0.03 (6%) | 0.05 (11%) | 0.04 (10%) | 0.03 (7%) | -0.01 (-4%) |
| Any but Top-Tier  | 0.04 (8%) | 0.05 (14%) | 0.03 (13%) | 0.02 (8%) | -0.01 (-4%) |
| Transit Only      | 0.04 (11%) | 0.05 (19%) | 0.03 (17%) | 0.02 (14%) | -0.02 (-12%) |

When only top-tier ASes are malicious, the max-flow based proxy selection algorithm tends to select top-tier ASes with high degrees, leading to higher failure rates. We varied the types of malicious ASes to evaluate the effectiveness of Senser against different adversaries. Table 2 shows the difference in failure rates between the random and AS-disjoint algorithms, along with the percentage improvement of the AS-disjoint algorithm. The highest improvement, up to 15%, is observed for "transit only" AS types, as the AS-disjoint algorithm can avoid having a transit AS appear in multiple paths, which would otherwise be shared by paths from multiple proxies if chosen randomly.

## Impact of Number of Nodes on Failure Rate

To analyze how the number of nodes affects the failure rate, we set \( n = 11 \) (corresponding to a 40% failure rate with the AS-disjoint algorithm when only transit ASes are malicious) and varied \( k \), the number of proxies used. Figure 10 illustrates the effect on the randomized algorithm; the effect on the AS-disjoint algorithm is similar and is omitted for brevity. As the number of proxies increases, the failure rate decreases for most AS types until about 13 or 15 proxies are used. The failure rate slightly increases when only top-tier ASes are malicious, due to the high probability of additional malicious top-tier ASes routing the traffic of additional proxies. Table 3 highlights the differences in failure rates and the percentage improvement of the AS-disjoint algorithm over the random algorithm. The AS-disjoint algorithm performs worse with only top-tier ASes when \( k = 17 \), but performs the same or better in all other cases, with up to a 19% improvement for only transit ASes.

## Weighted Randomized Selection Algorithm

Section 4.4 describes an attack where a knowledgeable adversary can use the AS-disjoint proxy selection algorithm to increase their chances of controlling a majority of the selected proxies. The weighted randomized selection algorithm mitigates this attack by choosing \( \lfloor \alpha k \rfloor \) proxies using the AS-disjoint proxy selection algorithm and \( \lceil k(1 - \alpha) \rceil \) proxies using the random proxy selection algorithm. Figure 11 shows the performance of various \( \alpha \) values when transit and endpoint ASes are malicious. An \( \alpha \) as low as 0.3 shows a clear improvement over the randomized proxy selection algorithm when \( k \geq 11 \), and the improvement increases with \( \alpha \). However, a higher \( \alpha \) makes the proxy selection more predictable. An \( \alpha \) of 0.5 prevents the majority of proxies from being chosen by the potentially vulnerable AS-disjoint proxy selection algorithm while reducing the random algorithm’s failure rate for \( k \geq 11 \).

## Evaluation Summary

We demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of Senser through a combination of actual deployment on Amazon EC2 nodes and simulations using a dataset of PlanetLab proxies. In our evaluation using the Alexa top 1,000 websites, Senser accurately detected censorship in many scenarios for a majority of sites. Additionally, under several likely attack scenarios, our AS-disjoint proxy selection effectively reduced the potential impact of malicious ASes. Our studies also showed that increasing the number of proxies hedges the risk in the presence of malicious ASes.

## Conclusion

This paper introduces a system for validating retrieved web content in the presence of AS-level adversaries. Senser operates by forming a consensus of the requested web content using multiple proxies located at diverse vantage points in the network. By using an AS-aware proxy selection algorithm, Senser achieves good network diversity and, in many instances, prevents even large autonomous systems from undetectably altering requested web content. We validate our approach using both simulations and a testbed deployment, showing that our system accurately detects the malicious modification of retrieved web content for a majority of sites in many conservative attacker configurations. Senser’s practical approach improves the ability to detect censorship on the web over the current status quo, with no service or software modification required on end host providers. This is essential, as 75% of the Alexa Top 1,000 sites do not provide SSL/TLS.

### A Survey of SSL Support

To quantify the level of SSL adoption among popular websites, we tested the ability of Alexa top-100, 1k, 10k, and 100k sites to support TLS/SSL (HTTPS) connections. Table 4 reports our results. "No page found" errors indicate cases where an HTTPS connection could be established, but the server returned a 404 error. In some cases, there was a 301 or 302 redirect from the HTTPS page to the HTTP page. To err on the side of inclusion, we consider "successes" (i.e., SSL supported) as any case where an SSL certificate existed, even if the certificate was misconfigured (i.e., did not report the correct domain name). The total successes and failures for each Alexa dataset are reported in the table. As can be seen, a vast majority of the top websites on the web do not offer proper SSL connections.

| Status          | Top 100   | Top 1k    | Top 10k   | Top 100k  |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Connection Refused | 42 (42%) | 512 (51%) | 5679 (57%) | 59362 (60%) |
| No Page Found   | 2 (2%)    | 15 (2%)   | 122 (1%)  | 1185 (1%) |
| Redirect to HTTP| 15 (15%)  | 195 (20%) | 1740 (17%)| 12305 (12%)|
| Total Success   | 41 (41%)  | 278 (28%) | 2459 (25%)| 27148 (27%)|
| Total Failure   | 59 (59%)  | 722 (72%) | 7541 (75%)| 72852 (73%)|

As shown, a significant majority of the top websites do not offer proper SSL connections.
