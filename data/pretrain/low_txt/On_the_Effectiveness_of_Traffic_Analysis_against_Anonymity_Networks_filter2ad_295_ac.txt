# Traffic Analysis Against Anonymity Networks

## 4. Experimental Results

### 4.1 Square-Wave and Step Patterns

**Figure 4:**
- **(a) Square-Wave Pattern (Before Rectification):** The server induced a "square-wave" pattern with an amplitude of 1 Mbit/s, along with other non-victim flows from the entry-to-victim and non-victim hosts having the four highest correlation coefficients. The victim location was in Texas, US.
- **(b) Square-Wave Pattern (After Rectification):** The flows in Figure 4(a) were adjusted and corrected using our rectification strategy.

The difference between the average throughput for the server-to-exit and the entry-to-client traffic (for all clients) was within 120 Kbit/s for the victim traffic. We removed flows where this difference exceeded 120 Kbit/s.

These experiments were repeated with the server injecting a "step" like pattern, achieved by switching the traffic between 1 Mbit/s, 50 Kbit/s, 300 Kbit/s, and 100 Kbit/s every 30 seconds. The average correlation between the server-to-exit and entry-to-client traffic statistics was higher than the average correlation to the non-victim client statistics. These results are shown in Figures 5(a) and 5(b).

We correctly identified the victim flow in 71 out of 90 trials, achieving a success rate of 78.9%. There were six false positives in our measurements, where non-victim clients showed the highest correlation to the server-to-exit traffic. In these false positives, the number of sample intervals for the entry-to-client traffic was less than half the number of sample intervals corresponding to the server-to-exit traffic, resulting in inaccurate correlations. In 13 of the remaining cases, we were unable to correctly select the victim either because the correlation coefficient was statistically insignificant (< 0.2), or the victim flow was filtered out due to its average throughput varying by more than 120 Kbit/s from the server-to-exit throughput.

### 4.2 Monitoring Multiple Tor Relays

To evaluate our attack in a scenario involving an additional relay, we launched a second relay at our institution. The purpose of this second Tor relay was to assess the effectiveness of our attack in the presence of more clients. The two relays together served approximately 1500 clients. This scenario provides insight into what can be expected when an adversary monitors multiple relays.

Our experiments involved injecting the "step" like pattern described above. These experiments were repeated 24 times, with 8 repetitions for each victim client location. We observed a higher average correlation between server-to-exit and entry-to-victim client traffic compared to non-victim clients' traffic. We were able to correctly identify the victim client in 14 out of the 24 trials, achieving a success rate of 58.3%. There were three false positives, where the correlation of the server-to-exit traffic was higher for a non-victim than for the victim. The remaining seven were false negatives, primarily due to the few sample points obtained during the experiment, which were further reduced by our flow alignment method. This loss of information decreased the correlation between the server-to-exit and entry-to-victim client traffic.

## 5. Limitations

Our attack is highly accurate in a controlled lab setup with symmetric network paths and capacities, characterized by low congestion and no uncontrolled disturbances. However, in tests with public Tor relays, the overall correlation between server-to-exit and entry-to-victim traffic decreases due to congestion and Tor's traffic scheduling, which distort the injected traffic pattern. In experiments involving data from the institutional Cisco router, such effects were pronounced. Additionally, there were fewer sample intervals compared to the data obtained from Linux NetFlow packages, due to flow aggregation, leading to flow records with unequal lengths and uneven spacing. To counter these effects, we devised an approximation strategy, described in Section 3. These approximations decrease the overall correlation between server-to-exit and entry-to-victim traffic, as the process eliminates data points from flow intervals that cannot be correctly rectified. This resulted in false positives in our measurements. Although not very precise, these results indicate the capabilities of more powerful adversaries. A powerful adversary could launch a Sybil attack by running many high-bandwidth Tor nodes to attract a large fraction of Tor traffic. Such relay operators, equipped with flow capture tools, would not require access to network routers for flow records.

## 6. Conclusion

We have demonstrated the practical feasibility of carrying out traffic analysis attacks using statistical correlation of traffic measurements obtained from NetFlow, a popular network monitoring framework installed in various router platforms. Our work verifies the results of previous simulation studies for traffic de-anonymization using NetFlow data. We focused on practically evaluating such an attack to identify the source of anonymous traffic. In a controlled lab environment, free from external network congestion, our attack was 100% accurate in identifying the targeted client. In experiments involving data from public Tor relays, our approach correctly identified the source of anonymous traffic in 81.6% of the cases, with a false positive rate of 5.5%. Currently, we are working on methods for defending against such attacks, using ideas related to selective dummy traffic transmission schemes.
