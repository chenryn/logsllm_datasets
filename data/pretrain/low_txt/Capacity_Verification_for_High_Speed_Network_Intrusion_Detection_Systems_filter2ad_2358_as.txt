**Abstract:**
This document outlines a mission-impact-based approach to INFOSEC (Information Security) alarm correlation, using the EMERALD M-Correlator prototype. The M-Correlator is designed to receive security alert reports from various INFOSEC devices, translate them into an internal incident report format, and then augment and fuse these alerts through a series of processing steps. The system calculates a relevance score by comparing the known topology of the alert target against the vulnerability requirements of the incident type. It also computes a priority score based on the criticality of the targeted assets and the user's interest in the alert type. Finally, it assigns an overall incident rank that combines the priority and likelihood of success. The M-Correlator uses an attribute-based alert clustering algorithm to combine related incident alarms, resulting in a filtered, lower-volume, and content-rich security-incident stream.

**1. Experimental LAN Setup:**
The experimental LAN includes a Checkpoint firewall, which forwards INFOSEC alerts to the M-Correlator. The network has one mission-critical server, Solarium, functioning as a fileserver, and one SGI HTTP server. There are two administrative accounts (em_admin1 and em_admin2) and three untrusted consultant accounts (consult1, consult2, and consult3) that require close monitoring. A highly sensitive source code directory is located on host Solomon.

**2. Mission Specification:**
The mission specification defines critical assets, resources, and the analyst's interest in different types of security alerts. The syntax for specifying critical assets and resources is provided, and the analyst's primary concerns are with direct threats to system control and user accounts, while probes and availability issues are given lower priority.

**3. Basic Rank Scenario:**
Table 3 illustrates an incident-ranking scenario based on the sample environment. Four INFOSEC devices (EMERALD eXpert-Net, eXpert-BSM, Checkpoint Firewall-1, and ISS RealSecure) contribute to a stream of eleven independent security incidents. High-interest incidents are highlighted in bold, and medium-interest incidents are underlined.

**4. Multi-sensor Alert Scenario:**
Table 5 provides a multi-INFOSEC device alert scenario, where 79 alerts are forwarded to the M-Correlator for analysis and database storage. The table includes the time, source, destination, and outcome of each alert. The M-Correlator ranks and aggregates these alerts, as shown in Table 6.

**5. Operational Exposures:**
The EMERALD development group has been conducting operational experiments with the M-Correlator using data sets from multiple organizations within the U.S. Department of Defense.

**6. Related Research:**
The problem of information security alert management is an active area of research. Commercial systems often use severity measurements to prioritize alerts, but the M-Correlator uses a multi-attribute mission profile for ranking. Other research focuses on intrusion report correlation, false positive reduction, and complex attack modeling. The M-Correlator differs in its emphasis on impact analysis and mission objectives.

**7. Conclusion:**
The M-Correlator provides a mission-impact-based approach to alert prioritization and aggregation, resulting in a filtered and content-rich security-incident stream. The system has been tested in several computing environments within the U.S. Department of Defense, contributing to the validation of mission-based correlation and providing insights for future extensions.
