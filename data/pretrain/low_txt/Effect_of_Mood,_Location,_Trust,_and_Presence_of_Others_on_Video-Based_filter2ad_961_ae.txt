### Usability and Reliability

Previous research has indicated that the SMS delivery failure rate can be as high as 5.1% under normal operating conditions [67]. In our study, we observed that some ESM (Experience Sampling Method) questionnaires were not delivered, as detailed in Section 3.3.3. Additionally, SMS-based mechanisms are not secure against a compromised phone. Although this issue did not arise during our study, and we did not use SMS for authentication, we recommend that future video-based social authentication systems avoid using SMS due to its usability and reliability concerns.

### Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, our sample primarily consists of individuals living on the east coast of the U.S., which may not be representative of other regions in the United States or globally. Furthermore, similar to other published studies [6, 47], our sample is predominantly white, highly educated, young, and of high socio-economic status. However, participants' phone use, app usage, and passcode habits are consistent with many mobile phone users in the U.S. [15, 43].

We recruited participants in two phases: initially through social media, flyers, and word of mouth, followed by snowball sampling to recruit members of their social networks. Social networks tend to be demographically homogeneous [66]. We prioritized social network connections because one of our goals was to determine whether members of a social network would be more willing to help each other compared to strangers. Our findings indicate that they were. These results provide a foundation for understanding the motivations behind social network-based authentication. We encourage replication of this work with a more diverse population.

Second, during the study, there were a few technical issues and human errors. For example, as mentioned in Section 3, two participants did not receive any ESM messages, and some responses were sent incorrectly (e.g., entering the wrong person's name). These participants and responses were excluded from the analysis. Given the overall response rate and the small number of these mistakes, we do not expect that the discarded responses significantly impacted the study's results.

Third, as in many similar studies [57, 68, 84], participants did not respond to every prompt. The response rate for the last two weeks of the study ranged from 47% to 64%. We assumed, conservatively, that non-responses indicated a lack of willingness to engage in authentication via video chat, as discussed in Section 4.

Fourth, there are potential security issues associated with using video chat for authentication, such as video spoofing or "deep fakes" [85]. Future work could explore intervention mechanisms to identify or prevent video spoofing and privacy-enhancing technologies to address other potential privacy issues, such as harassment or stalking [41].

Fifth, like all studies relying on self-reported data, our results are subject to reporting errors [18] and respondent adherence [45]. We made assumptions about the compliance of our participants, which may have influenced the results.

Sixth, although we explored some factors such as emotion (mood), we did not cover all sociocultural variables. Sociocultural and political-economic variables, as well as power dynamics, may influence the behavior of the sampled participants [89]. Future work should consider how these variables will affect the adoption and utilization of video-based social authentication.

Finally, we did not require participants to complete an actual authentication process. Instead, we used ESM to simulate an authentication process by video chat. By prompting participants at random times throughout the day, we gathered in situ data about their motivation to engage in or abstain from friendsourced authentication based on various factors such as feelings, location, and trust. We anticipated that surveying participants on their unmodified phones would provide more valuable insights than a modified authentication process. In real-world scenarios, social authentication might be a rare event, perhaps reserved for password resets or other unusual situations. Waiting for these events would have limited our ability to gather a large amount of data.

Notably, some participants believed they were genuinely helping people in their network. For example, one participant mentioned, "I thought every time I texted for help, that person had chosen me when they selected someone to help them access their app. I thought it was weird since I don’t actually know them, but I helped anyway." (P8). Another reported, "I just wanted to be helpful." (P13). This suggests that some participants viewed their responses as behavioral rather than attitudinal. Future work should examine whether these results hold in real authentication situations.

### Conclusion

Finding new ways to make authentication more secure and reliable is crucial. Our research suggests that social authentication using video chat might benefit end-users while leveraging a form of human-to-human identification that could be more reliable than alternatives. Our study provides insights into contextual factors that may affect the use of video chat as a fallback authentication method in a small social network (e.g., family members and close friends). Among these factors, trust, mood, location, and the presence of others stand out as significant.

While there are challenges, including the reliance on social ties and contextual factors, all participants in the study agreed to initiate and help with a video-based social authentication prompt at least once. Excluding non-responses, participants agreed to initiate or help more than 40% of the time. Most participants also expressed comfort with using video-based social authentication. With these opportunities and challenges in mind, we believe that video-based social authentication is a meaningful direction that requires further exploration. Our paper offers useful insights for the design of future video-based social authentication systems.
