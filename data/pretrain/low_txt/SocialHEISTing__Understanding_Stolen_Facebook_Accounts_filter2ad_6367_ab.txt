### Account Creation and Initialization

To create the accounts, we utilized a random user generator API [11] to generate names. We then assigned passwords by randomly selecting from the RockYou password list, which contains 32 million passwords exposed in a 2009 data breach [39]. To enhance the realism of these accounts, we established friend connections among them, mimicking the social nature of real Facebook accounts.

#### Profile Photos
We sourced profile photos from Creative Commons (CC) stock photo websites such as Pixabay [12], Flickr [4], Pexels [2], and Unsplash [7]. We specifically chose CC0-licensed photos, which can be used for any purpose without requiring attribution. We manually matched photos to accounts, ensuring that each profile photo aligned with the designated demographic attributes of the account. For example, a female adult account was assigned a profile photo depicting an adult woman. We uploaded the curated profile photos using a custom-built photo upload automation tool, making it easy for anyone to infer the demographic label of an account at a glance.

#### Timeline Data
To further emulate real Facebook accounts, we posted content on the timelines of the honey accounts. We collected publicly available tweets containing popular hashtags, such as #sports, #music, and #news, using the Twitter Streaming API [3] according to their terms of service. These hashtags were identified in previous work [13]. We removed personally identifiable information (PII) from the tweets and posted the sanitized text snippets on the timelines of the honey accounts using another custom-built automation tool. This ensured that the honey accounts displayed diverse and realistic content, enhancing their credibility.

### Realism and Interaction
We ensured the accounts appeared realistic by populating them with real-world data and establishing friend connections. The accounts stopped posting messages and interacting with each other shortly before the credentials were leaked. From that point, the only activity we carried out was accepting friend requests made by attackers. We did not engage in any further interaction, such as replying to private messages, to comply with our Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocol, which prohibited us from interacting with attackers (see Section 3.5 for more details).

While this approach may have introduced a sense of "staleness" to the accounts, the statistically significant differences in activity performed on accounts with different demographics give us confidence that we are capturing real attack trends.

### Data Collection Infrastructure
In this section, we describe the data collection infrastructure we built to retrieve activity data from the honey accounts. Figure 1 illustrates the components and their interactions.

#### Download Your Information (DYI) Archive
Facebook allows account owners, including test accounts, to download comprehensive records of their activity through DYI archives. We leveraged this feature to collect activity records of criminals.

#### DYI Downloader and Parser
DYI archives consist of web pages containing activity details for offline viewing. We automatically downloaded these archives and parsed their contents to extract and categorize login and logout information, device information, and password changes, among other details.

#### Mail Server and Parser
During the setup of test accounts, we associated specific email addresses with the honey accounts. These email addresses, one per Facebook test account, pointed to a mail server under our control. On this mail server, we received notifications about password changes, incoming friend requests, and private messages. Unlike DYI records, which we downloaded only once, the mail server provided real-time information, allowing us to react immediately when necessary, such as reverting password changes.

### Leaking Honey Credentials
Stolen credentials are often distributed on paste sites and other outlets by cybercriminals [48]. To attract cybercriminals, we leaked credentials (Facebook IDs and passwords) via paste sites on both the Surface Web (Pastebin.com, Paste.org.ru) and the Dark Web (Stronghold). These sites allow public pastes and display recent pastes to all visitors.

We leaked two-thirds of the honey accounts (672 out of 1008) to observe if criminals would attempt to compromise the remaining accounts through existing friend connections. We divided the leaked credentials into seven chunks, each containing up to 100 credentials, and leaked them daily, twice a day, to ensure exposure to users in multiple time zones. We also randomized the order of credentials in each chunk before leaking them.

### Ethical Considerations
We carefully considered the ethical implications of our work. We used sandboxed accounts isolated from the regular Facebook social graph to avoid harming legitimate users. We populated the accounts with publicly available stock photos and tweets to ensure no private information was leaked. We could easily change account passwords to lock out criminals if needed. Our monitor system recorded all attempts to change email addresses, and we had a mitigation plan in place. Additionally, we obtained ethics approval from our institution before starting the experiments.

### Threats to Validity
We acknowledge potential factors that may affect the validity of our findings. The content of the honey accounts, while realistic, might be obvious under close scrutiny. However, we believe these issues are minor since we recorded the activity of those who connected to the accounts. We also note that our findings may not be representative of malicious activity in social accounts stolen via other outlets, such as malware or underground forums.

### Data Analysis
In this section, we provide an overview of the activity performed by criminals in the honey accounts. We leaked credentials over a three-week period (June 1, 2018, to June 22, 2018), and our observations span six months (June 1, 2018, to December 1, 2018). Our analysis is based entirely on data collected from the honey accounts under our control.

#### Discarding Defective Accounts
We discovered that 79 accounts were defective and could not download activity information. Additionally, three accounts were blocked by Facebook. We excluded these 82 accounts from our analysis, reducing the effective number of honey accounts to 926. These functional accounts comprised 472 adult and 454 teen accounts, or 469 female and 457 male accounts. The effective number of leaked accounts reduced from 672 to 619.

#### Accesses and Associated Actions
46% of the functional leaked accounts (284 out of 619) received unauthorized accesses. We did not leak 307 accounts, and due to their sandboxed nature, attackers could not independently find and connect to them. However, 46 unleaked accounts (15%) received interactions, such as friend requests or private messages.

We observed various types of accesses, codified into a taxonomy:
- **Hijacker**: Password or email address change.
- **Chatty**: Sending private messages, creating group chats, posting updates.
- **Emotional**: Clicking on Facebook "like" buttons.
- **Searcher**: Entering search terms in the Facebook search bar.
- **Profile Editor**: Editing profile information.
- **Friend Modifier**: Adding or removing friends.
- **Curious**: Connecting to an account but not performing any of the above actions.

These access types are not mutually exclusive, except for the curious type.

#### Summary of Actions
We observed 322 unique accesses resulting in 1159 actions. Table 1 summarizes the actions grouped by access type. Curious, searcher, and chatty accesses dominated, responsible for 45%, 30%, and 11% of all actions, respectively. Emotional and profile editor accesses were the least active. This indicates that criminals are particularly interested in searching for information and writing private messages and public posts.

In total, 157 accounts received friend requests, comprising 83 teen and 74 adult accounts, or 31 male and 126 female accounts. Notably, 46 unleaked accounts also received friend requests, suggesting further distinctions in criminal behavior across different demographics.
