### Data Compromised Repository Websites

These sites list websites that have suffered from data breaches, revealing registered user details, especially usernames and passwords. Many people reuse the same password for multiple accounts, so knowing one password may grant access to other accounts/services.

You can download the Pwned Passwords list, which contains additional data about each breached account. Search using a target email address or password to see if it appears in plain text on any public password dump list (see Figure 6-3). This is a recommended site.

**Note:** The darknet contains many public databases listing pwned accounts with passwords in clear text. The last known password dump file found on the darknet contained 1.4 billion clear-text credentials in a single file.ii

For individuals, it is illegal to access other people’s accounts using stolen credentials from pwned databases. For OSINT investigators, the debate continues whether leaked information is a legal source of OSINT.
