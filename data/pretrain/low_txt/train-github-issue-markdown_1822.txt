### Description of the New Feature/Enhancement

**Feature Name:** User Profiles in Terminal Taskbar Menu

**Description:**
Integrate user profiles into the right-click taskbar menu of the terminal application. This enhancement will allow users to select a specific profile from the context menu, which will then launch the terminal with the chosen profile instead of the default one. If the terminal is already open, selecting a profile from the menu should open a new tab or a new window with the selected profile.

**Key Points:**
- **User Profiles in Context Menu:** Add an option to select user profiles directly from the right-click taskbar menu.
- **Profile-Specific Launch:** Launch the terminal with the selected profile if it is not already open.
- **New Tab/Window for Open Terminals:** If the terminal is already open, open a new tab or a new window with the selected profile.

This feature will enhance user productivity and provide a more customized and efficient terminal experience.
