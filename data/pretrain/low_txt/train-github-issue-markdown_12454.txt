When I read a Go package, I would like to know the version of Go in which a particular method was introduced. For example, in Java, this information is often provided as "Since: 1.2," and in PHP, it might be indicated as "PHP 5 >= 5.3.3." 

Is there a similar way to determine the version in which a method was added in Go?
