### Description
Starting with Android 9, the operating system restricts access to the microphone, camera, and other device sensors for applications running in the background. This security enhancement helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. 

In addition, both iOS 14 and Android 12 introduced a visual indicator on the status bar—a green dot—that appears when an application is accessing the device’s camera. This feature provides users with real-time visibility into which apps are using the camera, enhancing transparency and user control over their privacy.
