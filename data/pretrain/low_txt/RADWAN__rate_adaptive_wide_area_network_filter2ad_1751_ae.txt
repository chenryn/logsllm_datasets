### Observations and Analysis

In Section 5, we observed that the latency in capacity reconfiguration is primarily due to the time required to turn the laser back on after reprogramming the transceiver module. Our analysis shows that this process takes a significant amount of time. To further investigate, we plotted the distribution of time taken to change modulations without turning off the laser. The results indicate that, on average, it only takes approximately 35 ms to change modulations. This suggests a potential for achieving hitless capacity changes in fiber networks.

### Cost and Distance Considerations

One of the key benefits of deploying bandwidth-variable links (BVTs) is their cost savings. Although we cannot disclose the exact discounted retail price, our device manufacturers confirm that the cost of BVTs is comparable to that of 100 Gbps static transceivers. This cost parity is a motivating factor for operators to deploy BVTs, even if they are reprogrammed infrequently.

However, higher-order modulations have a disadvantage: they limit the distance light can travel. As mentioned in §1, QPSK modulation supports 100 Gbps data rates for distances up to 3,000 km, 8QAM allows 150 Gbps for up to 2,100 km, and 16QAM supports 200 Gbps for up to 800 km. Our analysis of fiber distances in our WAN reveals that 50% of our fiber paths are less than 800 km (capable of supporting 16-QAM), 45% are between 800 and 2,100 km (capable of supporting 8-QAM), and only 5% are longer than 2,100 km. While our analysis did not account for these distances, we believe it will not significantly impact our results. Additionally, device manufacturers are working to improve the distances for higher-order modulations.

### Related Work

Our research builds on several lines of related work:

#### Optical and IP Layer Orchestration
- **Singh et al. [24]**: Analyzed the SNR of links in a large North American backbone over 2.5 years and proposed adapting link capacities to SNR. We extended their study period to 3 years, broadened their initial measurements, and proposed a centralized Traffic Engineering (TE) controller system, RADWAN. We evaluated the interaction between dynamic capacity links and IP layer flows through simulations and a realistic testbed.
- **Jin et al. [18]**: Focused on cross-layer optimization between IP and optical layers, showing that reconfiguring wavelengths provides latency gains for deadline-driven bulk transfers. However, their work keeps the capacity of each wavelength static. In contrast, our work focuses on reconfiguring the capacity of wavelengths without migrating them across links, providing measurements from an operational backbone and emphasizing throughput and reliability.

#### Data from Microsoft’s WAN Measurements
- **Govindan et al. [13]**: Studied 100 failure events across two WANs and data center networks, offering insights into maintaining high availability for content providers. They reported root causes of failures, including optical transmitters. We complement their work by focusing on optical layer failures.
- **Ghobadi et al. [11, 12]**: Provided insights into the impact of temporal changes in SNR on link capacities, including capacity gain, availability, and throughput. We extend their analysis by proposing and building the system infrastructure required for capacity-variable links and benchmarking throughput gains using realistic IP-level data.
- **Filer et al. [7]**: Discussed the benefits of optical elasticity and the long-term goal of unifying the optical control plane with routers under a single Software Defined Network (SDN) controller. They recognized YANG [4] and SNMP as potential starting points for a standard data model and control interface. Our work explores how programmability in the optical layer can bring throughput gains and presents a cross-layer WAN traffic controller for dynamic capacity links.
- **Marian et al. [22]**: Focused on IP and TCP layer measurements such as packet loss and inter-arrival times on fiber optic spans. In contrast, we capture failures in the optical layer using failure tickets.

#### Hardware Feasibility Studies
- **Yoshida et al. [28, 29]**: Studied the use of 12.5 GHz spectrum slices for allocating bandwidth-variable connections, laying the foundation for the feasibility of building necessary hardware with variable bandwidth capabilities. We use real-world measurements and build the system that bridges the gap between optical and IP layers.
- **Fischer et al. [8] and Teipen et al. [26]**: Demonstrated the need for advanced modulation formats, showing that adaptive transceivers can support multiple operational configurations. Their work, however, did not include real-time reconfiguration mechanisms. In this paper, we discuss the advantages of reconfigurable capacities in real-time based on live SNR measurements.

### Conclusion

In this work, we quantify the throughput and reliability benefits of rate-adaptive wide area networks. Our analysis of over 2,000 links in an optical backbone over 3 years shows that the capacity of 64% of IP links can be increased by ≥75 Gbps, yielding an overall throughput gain of 134 Tbps. Furthermore, 25% of link failures can be avoided by reducing the transmission rate from 100 Gbps to 50 Gbps. To leverage these benefits, we present RADWAN, a traffic engineering system that dynamically adapts link rates to enhance network throughput and availability. We evaluate RADWAN in a testbed with 1,540 km of optical fiber and simulate throughput and availability gains at scale. Compared to state-of-the-art software-defined WANs, RADWAN achieves 40% higher network throughput in a realistic network with elastic traffic demands. We also address the challenge of hardware delay in modifying a link's capacity, analyzing the cause of this delay in current optical transceivers and proposing a potential solution to reduce it from over a minute to a few milliseconds.
