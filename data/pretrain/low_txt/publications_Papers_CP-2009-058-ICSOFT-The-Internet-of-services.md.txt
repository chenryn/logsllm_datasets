#### Abstract
The vision of the Internet of Services (IoS) represents a new business model that can fundamentally transform the way we discover, select, invoke, and interact with services. Just as the Internet is viewed as a web of information, it can also be configured to support an Internet of Services. The IoS envisions using the Internet as a medium for buying and selling services, making them tradable entities. Service marketplaces, which bring together providers and consumers to trade services and engage in business interactions, are essential for realizing the IoS vision. Thus, the IoS provides the business and technical foundation for advanced business models where service providers and consumers form networks for service provision and consumption.

#### 1. Introduction
The evolution of services has been significantly influenced by advances in computer systems and information technologies over the past six decades. Initially, services were delivered by humans, but the development of computer systems allowed for the automation of many service-related activities. This trend shifted human tasks to machines and computers, leading to the rise of the service industry.

The term "IoS-based service" refers to services provided through the Internet. These services serve a dual purpose: they can be directly used by consumers and can also be invoked by technical systems to access remote business functionality. The technical goal of the IoS is to provide models, platforms, and tools that make services tradable on the Internet and composable into value-added services. Many research questions remain about the mapping between real-world or economic services and IoS-based services. Additionally, while some services can be fully digitalized, most still rely on physical elements and human resources.

IoS-based services can be described using conceptual models that capture business, operational, and technical information, enabling the exchange and trade of services among organizations and consumers. Since these models are specifications with clear semantics, Information Systems (IS) and Information Technology (IT) can be deployed to enable the automatic invocation of services using Internet protocols. An IoS-based service model is provision-oriented and service-centric, separating characteristics into business, operational, and technical categories. These characteristics capture the purpose of the service, required resources, and used protocols and standards.

#### 2. The Economic Value of Services
Services have become a central component of most economies, with infrastructure services such as transportation and communication being fundamental. In many countries, the government is a major provider of services, operating in sectors like water management, public safety, and healthcare.

Given the economic importance of services, a key question is how the Internet can facilitate a genuine market for cross-border IoS-based services. As the Internet is now integral to global societies, economies, and commerce, it can provide the necessary infrastructure for the IoS. The Internet can host electronic marketplaces for trading services and develop new standards and models to digitally describe services and industries.

Recently, the European Parliament approved the service directive (EU, 2006), which aims to enhance competition by removing restrictions on cross-border market access for services in Europe. This measure has significant implications for businesses and the IT community, as the service sector represents more than 70% of the Gross National Product and could increase service consumption in the European Union by 0.6% (37 billion Euros) (CE, 2005). Figure 1 illustrates the gross value added by services in Germany in 2005, as provided by the Statistisches Bundesamt.

#### 3. Challenges for the IoS
Developing solutions for the IoS is more complex than previous approaches, which primarily involved software implementations like Web services. Real-world services have specific characteristics, including intangibility, inseparability, immersiveness, bipolarity, variability, ostensibility, long-running nature, decoupling, perishability, and quality. The IoS requires a strong emphasis on both the business and IT aspects of services. Legal, regulatory, and business model challenges need to be addressed, and efficient approaches for fostering innovation are required.

An infrastructure for service delivery must be provided to enable businesses to participate in the IoS. This infrastructure must be scalable, support brokering, mediation, billing, security, and trust services, and adapt to the given business context. Service engineering methodologies are needed to integrate software and service providers, providing methods and tools for constructing and deploying services. Governance is crucial to align business services with business requirements, reducing risks and ensuring compliance with rules and regulations.

#### 4. TEXO Project
The TEXO project aims to develop a new generation of marketplaces for IoS-based services. It is part of the broader THESEUS initiative, funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research in Germany. The project targets the development of an open platform for the creation, distribution, and provision of (business) services by supporting IoS-based services. The project involves six application scenarios: ALEXANDRIA, CONTENTUS, MEDICO, ORDO, PROCESSUS, and TEXO.

The outcomes of early prototypes will be crucial for testing the applicability of new technologies and business models. Positive validation of innovative models will pave the way for their adoption by the industry.
