### Papers in WEIS and SOUPS

Both the Workshop on the Economics of Information Security (WEIS) and the Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS), organized by Lorrie Cranor, have consistently featured a significant number of papers on their core topics. To fully realize the potential of the field, we recognized the need to address not only the privacy conundrum and password usability but also broader and more profound issues, such as the nature of deception both online and offline, and the psychological mechanisms driving overreactions to terrorism. Dave Clark at MIT offered the premises for the first Security and Human Behavior (SHB) workshop, which took place in June 2008. SHB primarily attracts security engineers and psychologists, with a notable presence of anthropologists, philosophers, and even a few magicians. The workshop has grown in strength, though it remains limited to about 60 invited participants to maintain an interactive environment, unlike WEIS, which now has over 100 attendees.

### Horizons

In addition to the threads on the econometrics and behavioral economics of security that I have expanded upon, there are many other developments in the field. Recent WEIS events have seen numerous papers building on established themes such as patch management, vulnerability markets, information sharing mechanisms, investment models, regulation, open versus closed systems, rights management, and insurance. However, new topics continue to emerge. For instance, Cormac Herley and colleagues at Microsoft have published a series of microeconomics papers on the incentives within the underground economy [17, 18, 22, 23, 24]. Ben Edelman's paper on adverse selection in certification revealed that privacy-certified websites were more likely to invade user privacy, and the top search ad was more than twice as likely to be malicious compared to the top free search result [15]. My students, Shishir Nagaraja and Hyoungshick Kim, explored evolutionary games on networks, gaining insights into optimal strategies for both law enforcement and insurgents [25, 27].

By WEIS 2009, privacy failures in social networks had become a hot topic [13]. In 2010, we learned that the pay-per-install industry was largely driven by pornography [41], and a serious paper from the Federal Reserve discussed card fraud [36]. In 2011, a keynote talk on neuroeconomics highlighted the scientific end, while a practical survey of the certification practices of the top million websites found that only 5.7% adhered to best practices [40]. At WEIS 2012, we discovered that U.S. cities with competing hospital groups had poorer information security practices compared to those with monopolies [20]. One of the first papers on macro aspects showed that participation in e-crime across countries varied with English proficiency, labor market size, and local government corruption, but not with per-capita GDP [19].

### Retrospective Growth

The growth of security economics has occurred in three main directions. First, there has been a broadening of its scope, with papers now covering "security and X" for various subdisciplines of economics, psychology, and related humanities. Second, there has been a deepening of profitable research areas, such as behavioral aspects and the econometrics of wickedness. Third, there has been an expansion into "security economics of Y" for various application areas, ranging from payment cards to electricity meters and online pornography. There is still considerable room for further research in each of these directions.

### Conclusions

The study of security economics began in earnest in 2000 and received a significant boost from two key factors: the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent growth of the security-industrial complex, and the increasing adaptation of technical security mechanisms to support restrictive business models, such as Trusted Computing and Digital Rights Management (DRM). Security economics has provided valuable insights into many interesting topics, including cooperation and conflict in networks, drivers for security technology adoption, and the limitations of insurance markets.

This article provides only a snapshot; interested readers should consult our survey paper [9] and the security economics web page [12] for more information. For a broader perspective, see The Oxford Handbook of the Digital Economy, which includes surveys on the economics of security and privacy, as well as related fields such as Internet regulation, software platforms, card payments, auctions, reputation systems, price comparison, social networks, and copyright infringement [30].

Over the past fifteen years, the world economy has been disrupted, and white-collar crime has been revolutionized by the Internet. As computers and communications become increasingly embedded and invisible, more devices and services will have an online component. More industries will resemble the software industry. While utopian visions may predict the end of crimes and conflicts, they will persist, albeit with an increasing online aspect. The concepts and tools of security economics will become one of the many frameworks we use to understand the world and our place in it.
