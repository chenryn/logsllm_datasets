### Impact on Application-Level Performance

#### 9. Discussion and Limitations

In this section, we address additional issues that were not covered in the main body of the paper.

**RF Tuning and Hardware Optimization:**
We anticipate that Morpho's performance can be significantly enhanced with improved RF optimization. Other studies have reported backscatter ranges of tens of meters and higher sensitivity in passive detectors [18, 33, 49, 52]. Such advancements could extend our techniques to larger areas, such as multiple rooms or an entire home, and also allow us to reduce carrier transmit power levels, enabling battery-powered mobile devices like smartphones to function as central stations.

**Frequency-Hopping in Morpho:**
A key challenge in extending our architecture to frequency-hopping spread spectrum radios is the fact that passive radios are not frequency selective. Frequency hopping can be enabled on the passive transmitter side (i.e., backscatter) by leveraging frequency shifting and recent advances in single-sideband backscattering [20]. These methods add only a small amount of complexity and power to our design. Further research is needed to enable similar frequency-hopping capabilities in the passive receiver.

One potential solution is to use a dedicated channel for passive communication while allowing active communication to proceed with frequency hopping. This decoupling approach allows the use of passive components, such as SAW filters tuned to the specific channel, to make the passive receiver frequency selective [17]. However, this method restricts passive communication to a single channel, which may limit scalability in large networks.

#### 10. Related Work

We provide a brief overview of relevant related work that has not been highlighted in previous sections.

**Multi-Radio Wireless Networks:**
There has been extensive research on multi-radio wireless networks, exploring various combinations such as Bluetooth + WiFi [1, 5, 37], WiFi + LTE [7, 10, 26], and WiFi + 60 GHz [47]. These studies have leveraged multi-radio combinations for energy efficiency [1, 15, 21, 24, 25], traffic management [14], mobility management [38], and routing management [2, 11].

While there are similarities between these efforts and ours at a high level, the critical difference is that we are designing a multi-radio system that operates at ultra-low power regimes (between 1 µW to 1 mW) and can switch at microsecond granularity to react to highly dynamic channels. This design space necessitates rethinking all layers of the stack.

**Active-Passive Radios:**
Recent work has explored the integration of active and passive components, albeit in limited ways. For example, wakeup radios integrate passive envelope detectors with active receivers to enable extremely low-power remote wakeups [44, 45]. On the transmitter side, a recent short paper examines reusing hardware elements between 10 Mbps BPSK Backscatter and 1 Mbps Bluetooth [43]. Some approaches have also integrated active and passive components at higher layers of the stack, such as BLISP [19] and Braidio [17], which shift carrier generation between endpoints to offload power. Our work demonstrates how active-passive radio components can be utilized in every aspect of communication, including data transfer, measurement, and control messages.

**Backscatter Communication:**
There has been significant activity in backscatter communication in recent years, with a focus on repurposing ambient carriers such as Bluetooth [12, 20, 57], WiFi [8, 23, 36, 54-57], Zigbee [20, 57], FM [51], and LoRA [48] to enable backscatter communication. Recent work has shown that backscatter can be used for applications like low-power HD video streaming [33]. However, the issue of handling the inherent flakiness of passive radios under channel dynamics has received little attention. Morpho addresses this gap.

#### 11. Conclusion

In conclusion, we present a new architecture for low-power radios that integrates passive and active components to improve performance. Unlike duty-cycling based radios, which aim to maximize sleep times to save power, polymorphic radios leverage passive modes to conserve energy. This paradigm is particularly useful for low-power radios used in streaming mode to transmit data from or to wearable, IoT, and mobile devices. We instantiate our ideas in a full hardware-software stack called Morpho, demonstrating up to an order of magnitude improvement in energy efficiency while maintaining robustness to channel fluctuations.
