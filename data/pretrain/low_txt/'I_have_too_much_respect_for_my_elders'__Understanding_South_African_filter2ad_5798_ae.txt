### Inappropriate and Disturbing Content on Social Media

Participants frequently encountered disturbing content on social media, such as nudity or revenge postings with sexual content. For example, one participant (P13) described a situation where they were directed to search for a specific individual and discovered explicit images of that person.

**Interviewer (I):** What did you do to stop that?

**P13:** I stopped searching for that person.

In some cases, inappropriate content appeared in Status messages, which participants had no control over. One participant mentioned seeing a contact's Status message about their partner being physically abusive. In such instances, participants often resorted to taking a break from the platform or waiting for the Status to disappear after 24 hours. Some participants also reported scrolling past and logging out to avoid the content.

### Social Media as Data Storage in Case of Theft

A significant theme that emerged from the interviews, especially among lower-income individuals, was the use of social media platforms as a means of data storage. This practice was driven by the high incidence of phone theft in South Africa, with over 475,000 reported cell phone thefts in the past year. Participants wanted to ensure that even if their devices were stolen, they would still have access to their cherished memories stored in pictures.

**P45:** I only post the pictures that I like and think are nice. I also ensure that I post the pictures I would like to have even after my phone has gone missing.

Another reason for uploading images to social media was to address phone memory issues or in case of device malfunction. At least seven lower-income participants reported that one of their primary uses for social media was to upload their pictures to either Facebook or Instagram for later retrieval. One participant, P49, explained her reasoning:

**I:** Why do you post your pictures on Facebook?

**P49:** I want to keep them.

**I:** Oh, so why do you keep them on Facebook? Why can’t you keep them somewhere else?

**P49:** Memory cards have issues sometimes; they reformat themselves.

**I:** And Facebook never reformats?

**P49:** Never.

However, those who used this strategy acknowledged the negative repercussions of uploading all their photos to Facebook or Instagram. For instance, one participant expressed concern that anything uploaded for "storage" on Facebook could be seen by others, limiting their control over privacy.

**I:** What would make you want to use Facebook again?

**P43:** If there was a guarantee that my pics cannot be downloaded, then it would be fine.

**I:** Why is protection of pictures so important to you?

**P43:** For the sake of my privacy. So that nothing negative can be circulated about me.

Using social media as a means to preserve data in the event of phone theft highlights the intersection between physical and digital privacy for our participants.

### Discussion

Our findings indicate that users were primarily concerned about other individuals seeing their posts but lacked knowledge on how to control information visibility on social media platforms. Additionally, users struggled to manage their privacy, particularly in contexts of shared devices. Physical safety threats led participants to prefer non-real-time posting and to use social media for data storage. Participants also experienced frequent account hacking and often encountered crime-related content on social media that was sometimes disturbing.

Based on our findings, we make the following recommendations for future work:

#### 5.1 Challenge “Always Online” Assumptions

Designers should challenge assumptions about 'typical' users, such as assuming they are always online or have reliable, frequent access to the Internet. These assumptions can disadvantage users in resource-constrained settings with high data costs. For example, recovering from an account hack is difficult if it requires constant connectivity. Privacy settings should be more accessible, and lightweight privacy on-boarding interfaces should be provided. Users could also benefit from familiar ways of finding information, such as an informational chatbot that responds to natural language questions about privacy or security.

#### 5.2 Improve Data Compartmentalization on Devices

Participants often faced security and privacy issues due to shared devices. The security community could help by designing better ways to compartmentalize data storage and access on a phone, making it easy for users to understand, use, and manage. This infrastructure should allow users to grant access to parts of the device or data without causing social awkwardness or challenging power dynamics.

#### 5.3 Accommodate Use in High-Crime Areas

Participants were often concerned with their physical safety. Future work could examine if non-real-time posting would alleviate some physical safety concerns by allowing users to schedule posts for later times. Systems to alert users if their posts contain personal information that could be misused or obfuscate certain information could also be beneficial in high-crime settings. Further work is needed to improve content moderation mechanisms in high-crime areas where inappropriate content and misinformation spread unchecked on social media platforms.

### Study Limitations

Our study had a sample size of 52 users, all living in Cape Town, South Africa. Interviews were conducted in a semi-structured manner, meaning that participants may not have explicitly discussed certain topics, but that does not preclude them from having a viewpoint on those subjects. Due to the number of interviews and the coding process, it is possible that some participant comments were not captured during our coding. Future work could extend the study to a wider demographic in other settings with low-income individuals.

### Conclusion

Our study demonstrated that South African mobile users are primarily concerned about who has access to their online data on social media. Participants were generally unaware of granular privacy settings and had to manage posting personal information in a high-crime area that could mark them as a target. Our findings suggest that the security community needs to better accommodate users in resource-constrained settings, improve data compartmentalization on devices, and design solutions to help users in high-crime areas use social media safely. Future work could implement the suggested design recommendations and evaluate their effectiveness at improving privacy and security management for users in resource-constrained settings. Future studies could also investigate people’s knowledge of privacy breaches and online tracking in resource-constrained settings.
