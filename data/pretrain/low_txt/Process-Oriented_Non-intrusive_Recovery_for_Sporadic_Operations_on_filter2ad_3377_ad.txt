### Service Outages and Cloud Operations Failures

In late March 2011, Intuit experienced a series of service outages (A. R. Hickey, 2011). These outages occurred on a Monday, Tuesday, and Friday, with many users reporting issues that lasted an entire week (A. R. Hickey, 2011). Key cloud-based Intuit services, such as QuickBooks Online, QuickBooks Online Payroll, and Intuit Payments Solutions, were affected. The outages were attributed to errors introduced during maintenance operations (A. R. Hickey, 2011).

### Reasons for Sporadic Operation Failures in the Cloud

Several factors can contribute to failures during sporadic operations in the cloud (M. Fu et al., 2014; M. Fu et al., 2015; M. Fu et al., 2016):

1. **Uncertainty of Cloud APIs**: 
   - When cloud operators perform sporadic operations, they interact with the cloud platform via API functions. For example, launching a cloud instance involves calling the "RunInstances" API in AWS EC2.
   - Cloud APIs can be unstable, leading to unpredictable failures. Common failure scenarios include:
     - **Execution Failure**: The API call does not complete successfully. For instance, a "RunInstances" call may fail to launch the instance.
     - **Delayed Execution**: Some API calls take longer than expected or get stuck. For example, a "TerminateInstances" call might take several hours without terminating any instances.
     - **Incorrect Response**: The API returns no result or an incorrect result. Research by Q. Lu et al. (2013, 2014) shows that the failure rates for certain cloud API functions range from 0.3% to 3.9%. While these rates are relatively low individually, the cumulative effect on sporadic operations can be significant, especially with frequent operations.

2. **Unpredictable Cloud Performance Variance**:
   - A study by Saarland University (J. Schad et al., 2010) found that performance unpredictability is a major issue in cloud computing, particularly on AWS EC2.
   - The study revealed that EC2 performance varies significantly, often falling into two distinct bands with a large gap between them. This variability is influenced by factors such as virtual system types and availability zones.
   - During sporadic operations, if the Service Level Agreement (SLA) is violated due to unpredictable performance, the operation is considered a failure.

3. **Race Conditions from Different Cloud Operators**:
   - In large-scale cloud systems, multiple teams often perform simultaneous operations. For example, one team may be upgrading the system while another is reconfiguring it.
   - These operations may manipulate the same resources, leading to race conditions. For instance, both a rolling upgrade and a reconfiguration operation might need to change the auto scaling group (ASG) parameters, potentially causing conflicts.
   - Such race conditions can lead to operational failures, such as launching the wrong number of instances or using the wrong image version.

### Failure Detection and Diagnosis for Sporadic Operations

To recover from operational failures, it is essential to first detect them. Failure detection methods include log-based and monitoring-based approaches. Our recovery method for sporadic operations is designed to be non-intrusive, relying on log analysis to detect failures.

#### POD-Diagnosis Framework

- **Overview**: POD-Diagnosis is a model-based approach that models sporadic operations as processes. It uses process context to locate errors, filters logs, visits fault trees, and performs on-demand assertion evaluation for failure detection and diagnosis (X. Xu et al., 2014).
- **Operation**: POD-Diagnosis detects cloud operational failures by analyzing runtime logs and comparing the current system state with expected assertions. If assertions are violated, a failure is detected.
- **Examples**: 
  - **Assertion Evaluation**: If a log indicates that a new launch configuration is attached to machine image 001, but the assertion expects image 002, a failure is detected.
  - **Cloud Infrastructure Errors**: Other detected errors include long termination times, inability to launch or stop instances, and registration issues with elastic load balancers.
- **Recovery Triggering**: Once a failure is detected, POD-Diagnosis triggers the recovery service (POD-Recovery) to address the issue. The recovery service receives the current operational step specifications and the erroneous state of cloud system resources.

#### Cooperation with POD-Recovery

- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**: The interaction between POD-Diagnosis and POD-Recovery follows the SOA pattern, allowing components to provide and consume services over a network (E. Newcomer and G. Lomow, 2004).
- **Real-Time Recovery**: POD-Diagnosis aims to detect failures as soon as possible to enable timely recovery. Late-detected failures, where the original operational step is lost, are out of the scope of our recovery framework.

### Literature Review

#### Existing Recovery Strategies for Cloud

- **Basic Concepts and Theories**:
  - **System Anomaly Detection**: Detects errors, failures, and other anomalies within a system, often using log analysis and clustering algorithms (Y. Liu et al., 2010).
  - **Fault Tolerance**: Achieved by creating system replicas to ensure service continuity. However, it has received limited attention in recent years (J. Behl et al., 2012).
  - **Disaster Recovery**: Focuses on recovering from natural or man-made disasters, ensuring business continuity (L. DuBois, 2013).
  - **System Rollback**: Rolls back the system to a previous consistent state, often using automated mechanisms like checkpoint-based or log-based rollback (E. N. M. Elnozahy et al., 2002).

- **Existing Cloud Recovery Strategies**:
  - **Rollback Recovery for Cloud Applications**
  - **Disaster Recovery in Cloud Computing**
  - **Virtual Machine Replication in Cloud**
  - **Fault-Tolerance in Cloud Computing**
  - **Recovery for Cloud Internal Protocols**
  - **Test-Driven Scripts for Cloud Operations**
  - **Exception Handling in Cloud Operations**
  - **Recovery for Cloud Operations as Transactions**
  - **Recovery for Cloud Operations Using Undo Framework**
  - **User-Guided Recovery for Cloud Web Service Applications**
  - **BPEL Recovery in Cloud**

Each strategy is discussed in terms of its relationship to the proposed recovery methodology, and a taxonomy is provided to determine the most relevant existing methods.

### Conclusion

Understanding the reasons for sporadic operation failures and implementing effective failure detection and recovery mechanisms are crucial for maintaining the reliability and performance of cloud-based services. The POD-Diagnosis and POD-Recovery frameworks, along with a review of existing recovery strategies, provide a comprehensive approach to addressing these challenges.
