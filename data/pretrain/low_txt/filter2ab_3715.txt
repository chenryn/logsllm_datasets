**ATT&CK ID:** T1564.004  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** NTFS File Attributes

Adversaries may exploit NTFS (New Technology File System) file attributes to conceal their malicious data, thereby evading detection. Each NTFS-formatted partition contains a Master File Table (MFT), which maintains records for every file and directory on the partition. MFT entries include various file attributes, such as Extended Attributes (EA) and Data attributes. When more than one Data attribute is present, these are referred to as Alternate Data Streams (ADSs). These attributes can be used to store arbitrary data, including complete files, making them an effective means of hiding malicious content.
