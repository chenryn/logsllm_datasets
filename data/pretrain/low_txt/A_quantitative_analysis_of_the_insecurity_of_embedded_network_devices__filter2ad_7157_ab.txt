The process can be divided into three sequential phases: reconnaissance, identification, and verification.

### Reconnaissance
In the first phase, nmap is utilized to scan large portions of the internet for open TCP ports 23 (Telnet) and 80 (HTTP). The results of this scan are stored in a SQL database.

### Identification
Next, the device identification process connects to all listening Telnet and HTTP servers to retrieve their initial output. For HTTP, a 'GET /' request is issued. This server output is then stored in a SQL database and matched against a list of signatures to identify the manufacturer and model of the device. For example, Figure 2 illustrates a typical Telnet login prompt common to Cisco routers and switches.

### Verification
Once the manufacturer and model of the device are positively identified, the verification phase uses an automated script to attempt to log into the devices found in the identification phase. This script uses well-known default root credentials for the specific device model and does not engage in any form of brute force password guessing. A unique device verification profile is created for each type of embedded device monitored. This profile contains all necessary information for the verification script to automatically negotiate the authentication process using either the deviceâ€™s Telnet or HTTP administrative interface. Figure 3.2 shows two typical device verification profiles: one for the administrative Telnet interface for Cisco switches and routers, and the other for the HTTP administrative interface for Linksys WRT routers using HTTP Basic Authentication. Each device verification profile includes username and password prompt signatures, default credentials, and authentication success and failure conditions for the particular embedded device type. Once the success or failure of the default credential is verified, the TCP session is terminated, and the results are written to an encrypted flash drive for offline analysis.

### Device Selection
The full list of devices currently monitored by our default credential scanner can be found on our project webpage. To be included in this list, an embedded device's default root credentials must be well-known and obtainable through manufacturer documentation or simple search engine queries. The device selection process is manual and iterative. We begin by analyzing data gathered during the reconnaissance phase, which collects the initial output from active Telnet and HTTP servers. We maintain three sets of signatures:
- **Non-embedded devices:** Popular HTTP servers like Apache and IIS, and general-purpose operating systems.
- **Non-candidate embedded devices:** Devices that do not ship with well-known default credentials.
- **Candidate embedded devices:** Devices that we are actively monitoring.

After tagging the reconnaissance data using these signature sets, we manually inspect the remaining records, creating new signatures and device verification profiles as needed.

### Network Range Selection
Initially, our scan was directed towards the largest ISPs in North and South America, Europe, and Asia. As we refined our scanning infrastructure, we gradually expanded the scope to include select geographical locations within the United States. After six months of testing to ensure no harm to scanned networks, we allowed the scanner to operate globally. Using a reverse lookup of the MaxMind GeoIP database, we included every /24 network in the IPv4 space associated with a geographical location.

### Ethical Considerations and Due Diligence
While the technical methodology of our project is straightforward, gathering real-world data on the vulnerability rates of embedded devices has raised ethical concerns. Port scanning a remote network can be seen as a hostile and malicious attack. However, gathering large-scale, quantitative evidence is necessary to move beyond vague suspicions of embedded device security issues. As advocated in a recent position paper on the ethics of security vulnerability research, such proactive research serves an important social function and is neither unethical nor illegal under U.S. law.

To ensure ethical behavior and due diligence, the research team upholds high standards:
- **Isolated and fortified operating environment:** Protected against compromise and data exfiltration.
- **Clear experimental protocol:** Ensures no harm is done.
- **Minimal resource usage:** Designed to accurately verify device vulnerability without interfering with normal operations.
- **Opt-out mechanism:** Instructions for permanently opting out of the scan are provided on a public webpage.

### Malicious Potential of Embedded Device Exploitation
This section discusses several novel ways of exploiting vulnerable embedded devices due to their unique functions and hardware capabilities. After auditing the functional capabilities of many different embedded devices, we have concluded that the following attacks are trivially possible among a majority of embedded devices within the appropriate functional categories:
- **Massive DDoS Potential:** Large vulnerable homogeneous device groups exist, making large-scale DDoS attacks feasible.
- **Enterprise Credential Leakage via Misconfiguration:** Organizations that apply the same set of administrative credentials to all managed devices risk total compromise if a single device is misconfigured.
- **VoIP Appliance Exploitation:** Publicly accessible HTTP interfaces of VoIP adapters often display diagnostic information without requiring user authentication, leading to potential SIP credential theft.
- **Data Leakage via Office Appliance Exploitation:** Network printers and document stations can be used to monitor and exfiltrate internal documents.

### Analysis of Results
