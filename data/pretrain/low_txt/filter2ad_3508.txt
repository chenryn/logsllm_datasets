## Introduction

Intrusion tolerance acknowledges that it is impossible to completely prevent attacks and intrusions in today's complex computer systems. The distributed and networked nature of current and developing systems facilitates the discovery and exploitation of vulnerabilities, making intrusion detection and early intervention often unfeasible. Intrusion tolerance aims to develop technologies that allow systems to continue operating correctly despite attacks, thereby denying the attacker the success they seek. For example, an intrusion-tolerant system may suffer a partial loss of service or resources due to an attack but will continue to operate in a degraded mode or trigger automatic mechanisms to regain and recover compromised services.

Similar goals are pursued in fields such as Byzantine Fault Tolerance, Survivability, and Autonomic Systems. Unlike fault tolerance, which deals with random failures, intrusion tolerance faces an intelligent adversary who can adapt and evolve as the system adapts and recovers. New technologies make older solutions obsolete and introduce new vulnerabilities. The challenge is to integrate intrusion tolerance into modern information systems and to make system developers and architects more comfortable and confident in using these technologies. How can we empower practitioners to navigate the ever-changing technology landscape and build systems that can be trusted and operate through attacks? How can we stay ahead of increasingly sophisticated adversaries?

The 4th Workshop on Recent Advances in Intrusion-Tolerant Systems (WRAITS), held in conjunction with DSN 2010, aims to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners to discuss and collaborate on groundbreaking ideas and fresh results in this field.

## This Year's Workshop

The concept of tolerating intrusions gained prominence in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Major research efforts led to the development of several intrusion-tolerant algorithms and systems, addressing the fundamental issues of building practical and intelligent intrusion-tolerant systems. The WRAITS workshop seeks to understand, disseminate, and collaborate on the challenges and innovative ideas in building intrusion-tolerant systems.

Despite significant progress, most modern systems are still not built as intrusion-tolerant systems. Reasons for this include a false sense of security, the absence of any major publicly acknowledged cyber-disaster, the continued fast-paced innovation in software construction, and the perception that intrusion tolerance is expensive. Combined with the changing technology landscape, intrusion tolerance remains a moving target that needs to accommodate and adapt to changes.

### Keynote Speech

The workshop begins with a keynote speech by Robert L. Constable from Cornell University, titled "Using Formal Methods to Build Systems that Survive Attacks." The talk focuses on recent work on systems that dynamically select and substitute protocol variants from libraries of formally synthesized and correct-by-construction protocols.

### Sessions

#### Session 1: Detection and Analysis

- **"Assessing the Attack Resilience of a Fortified Primary-Backup System"** by Dylan Clarke and Paul Ezhilchelvan from Newcastle University, UK. This paper presents an approach for making primary-backup replication solutions intrusion-tolerant, comparing the resulting solution with a state machine approach using simulations.
- **"A Security Evaluation of the Effect of Java Software Faults on Security Vulnerabilities and Their Detection by Commercial Web Vulnerability Scanner Tool"** by Tania Basso, Plinio Fernandes, Mario Jino, and Regina Moraes from UNICAMP, Brazil. The authors report experiments with software fault injection in Java web applications to assess the ability of web vulnerability scanners to detect introduced vulnerabilities.
- **"Analysis of a Novel Resilient Web Serving Architecture: Lessons Learned through Industry/Academia Collaboration"** by Yih Huang, Anup Ghosh, Tom Bracewell, and Brian Mastropietro from George Mason University and Raytheon Company, USA. The paper discusses penetration tests against an intrusion-tolerant web-serving system and presents enhancements to address discovered vulnerabilities.

#### Session 2: Systems and Architecture

- **"SCIT and IDS Architectures for Reduced Data Ex-filtration"** by Ajay Nagarajan and Arun Sood from George Mason University, USA. This paper combines the Self-Cleansing Intrusion Tolerance (SCIT) approach with intrusion detection systems, evaluating the architectures using decision trees and simulations.
- **"RAVE: Replicated AntiVirus Engine"** by Carlos Silva, Paulo Sousa, and Paulo Veríssimo from the University of Lisbon, Portugal. The paper presents the design and implementation of a replicated antivirus system for email servers, using multiple antivirus engines to increase overall detection capability while tolerating intrusions.
- **"Realizing S-Reliability for Services via Recovery-driven Mechanism"** by Quyen Nguyen and Arun Sood from George Mason University, USA. The paper proposes the notion of Intrusion Tolerance Quality of Service (IT-QoS) and a new quality metric for measuring reliability in the presence of attacks, focusing on web services and the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA).

#### Session 3: Evaluation, Assessment, and Governance

- **"On Rootkit and Malware Detection in Smartphones"** by Bryan Dixon and Shivakant Mishra from the University of Colorado, USA. This position paper discusses recent research on detecting and mitigating the propagation of rootkits and malware in smartphones, presenting a prototype strategy for detection.
- **"Survivability and Information Assurance in the Cloud"** by Melvin Greer from Lockheed Martin, USA. The paper outlines the security risks faced by cloud computing and provides recommendations for organizations aiming to use this technology.
