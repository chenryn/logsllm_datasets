### Device Category Share and Usage Trends

We calculated the share of each device category (PCs, tablets, and smartphones) in terms of the number of sessions. As shown in Figure 1b, the share of smartphone usage (represented by the blue surface) has significantly increased from 27% to 42%, primarily at the expense of PCs. The prevalence of tablets, depicted in green, remains relatively constant. Notably, the evolution of daily time spent on different devices has not changed substantially over the years (see Section 4.2 for more details).

### Usage Frequency, Duration, and Habits

For a detailed analysis, we focused on the last month of our dataset, which excludes public holidays and measurement outages, specifically October 2016.

#### Session Duration
Figure 2a illustrates the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) of session duration, expressed in minutes. Sessions on PCs tend to be longer compared to those on tablets and smartphones. While most sessions are relatively short—less than 15 minutes for PCs and 10 minutes for smartphones—there are occasional longer sessions that extend beyond one hour.

#### Webpages Accessed During Sessions
Figure 2b presents the CDF of the number of webpages accessed during a session. The differences among devices are minimal, with users typically accessing 5 or 6 webpages per session. Approximately 28% of sessions involve only one or two webpages, although some sessions include tens of webpages.

#### Unique Websites Accessed During Sessions
Figure 2c shows the distribution of the number of unique websites accessed during a session. Smartphone users tend to focus on a single website per session (78% of sessions), whereas PC users are more likely to visit multiple websites. For all devices, very few sessions include visits to four or more different websites.

#### Daily Sessions for Active Users
Figure 2d reports the number of daily sessions for an active user. The data indicates that users rarely engage in multiple WP sessions within a day, with no significant differences observed across device types.

### Monthly Frequency of WP Consumption

Next, we examined the frequency of WP consumption by users over the month. Figure 3 displays the CDF of the number of active days for WP users in the dataset. The results show that monthly usage is generally low, with 76% of users visiting WP on 5 or fewer days in a month. However, a small percentage (8%) of users access WP more than 15 days in a month. These findings align with the study by Daspe et al. [5], which found that 73% of survey participants access pornography no more than once or twice a week, and only 11% do so more than five times a week.

### Time-of-Day and Weekly Patterns

WP consumption varies throughout the day. Figure 4 shows the average percentage of sessions across the 24 hours of the day (red solid line). The x-axis starts at 4 AM, corresponding to the lowest activity period. The two main peaks occur immediately after lunchtime (2 PM - 4 PM) and after dinner (9 PM - midnight). The figure also includes the overall trend for all HTTP transactions (dashed blue line). Comparing WP traffic to total traffic, the peaks do not align, and the latter is more evenly distributed over daylight hours. This discrepancy may be due to the private and leisure nature of accessing pornographic content, often confined to intimate moments. Pornhub's global data, which reports an average session time of 9 minutes and 30 seconds for Italy, supports these observations.

#### Hourly and Weekly Variations
Figure 5 provides a heat map of the percentage variations from the gross weekly average (white color). Warmer tones indicate below-average values, while colder tones show above-average values. There is a noticeable decrease in traffic on Saturday evenings (7 PM - midnight) and an increase on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday mornings (9 AM - 1 PM). This pattern may be influenced by the closure of many commercial activities on Monday mornings in the monitored country. Pornhub's data also shows similar traffic patterns, with peaks around 2 PM - 5 PM and 10 PM - midnight. Cumulatively, Mondays have the highest daily accesses, while Saturdays have the lowest.

### Overall Pervasiveness of WP Access

Finally, we provide an overview of the fraction of all monitored subscribers who accessed WP websites. Although our dataset lacks fine-grained details about WP pervasiveness, we can still show the fraction of subscriptions where at least one user accessed WP during our observation period. Figure 6, with the x-axis representing the 31 days of our reference month, provides this information.

### Conclusion

This analysis provides a comprehensive view of the trends and patterns in web pornography consumption across different devices, time periods, and user behaviors. The findings highlight the increasing use of smartphones, the consistent behavior of tablet users, and the varying patterns of access throughout the day and week.
