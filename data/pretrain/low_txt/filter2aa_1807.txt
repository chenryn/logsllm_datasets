### Background of the Speech
The principles of Sun Tzu's *Art of War* can be applied to cybersecurity:
- If you do not know yourself or your enemy, you will surely fail.
- If you know yourself but not your enemy, your chances of success are slim.
- If you know both yourself and your enemy, you are certain to win.

#### Sophistication of Attacker vs. Level of Protection
| Level of Protection | None | Average | High |
|---------------------|------|---------|------|
| **Sophistication of Attacker** | Low | Mid | High |
| **Outcome** | Unsuccessful Attack | Discovered | Successful Attack (Undiscovered) |

### What is Information Leakage (IL)?
Information leakage occurs when sensitive information is released either purposefully or accidentally, placing your staff, intellectual property, systems, and networks at risk.

### What are the Risks of IL?
- **Enhanced Success for Attackers:** Leaked information can significantly improve an attacker's chances of success.
- **Competitive Disadvantage:** Organizations may lose their competitive edge if proprietary information is leaked.
- **Legal Risks:** Leaks can lead to legal liabilities and regulatory non-compliance.
- **Physical Harm:** Sensitive information can be used to target physical harm against staff and facilities.

### Types of Information Leakage

#### Technical
- **Passive Methods:**
  - Listening
  - Sniffers, scanning frequencies
- **Active Methods:**
  - Integration
  - War driving, war dialing, network scanning

- **Layer 2:**
  - MAC Address, SSID, Frequency Used
  - Identifying system make and model

- **Layer 3:**
  - Active: nmap, qoso, xprobe, ICMP, packeto
  - Passive: Sniffers, Kismet, radio scanners

- **Layer 4 and Above:**
  - SNMP: System processes, software, configurations
  - Network: Internal networks, routes, protocols
  - Application Servers: Websites, chat, email, Usenet, mailing lists
  - Header Information: Analyzing headers in postings
  - Special Cases: Firewalls, Firewalk, firewall fingerprinting, TEMPEST (EM emissions), surveillance devices

#### People
- **Public Posting:**
  - Websites: `www.target.com`, `www.google.com/advanced_search`
  - Domain Search: `webdev.archive.org`, `www.cyberalert.com`, `www.inboxrobot.com`
  - Marketing Materials: Advertisements, press releases
  - Tradeshows, social events, and informal gatherings

- **Technical Staff:**
  - Vendor Support Calls: Sharing full configurations, including passwords
  - Outsourcing: Lower security standards in outsourced companies
  - Online Forums: Posting questions on Usenet, webpages, etc.

- **Management:**
  - "Exceptions to Security Rules"
  - DR Drills

- **Personal Information:**

- **Hidden Gems:**
  - Intelliseek, Invisible Web, Librarians' Index to the Internet, Questia

#### Process
- **Paper:**
  - Dumpster Diving
  - Backups: Tapes, CDs, DVDs, floppy disks
  - Technology: Hard drives, PDAs, cell phones
  - Cleaning Staff: Ensuring trustworthiness

- **Government and Partners:**
  - Financial and personal information: SEC, Hoover's, search systems
  - Vendors and partners: Disclosing relationships, Google link searches

### How to Protect Against Information Leakage

- **People:**
  - Limit publicly posted information
  - Educate staff about the dangers of information leakage

- **Process:**
  - Regularly perform competitive intelligence searches
  - Remove "extreme damage" items from view
  - Create a classification system based on risk:
    - No damage to organization or people
    - Some damage to organization and/or people
    - Extreme damage to organization and/or people
  - Consider posting misinformation
  - Follow other best practices in security

- **Technology:**
  - Change banners on systems
  - Implement robust security measures

By understanding and addressing the various types of information leakage, organizations can better protect their sensitive data and reduce the risks associated with breaches.
