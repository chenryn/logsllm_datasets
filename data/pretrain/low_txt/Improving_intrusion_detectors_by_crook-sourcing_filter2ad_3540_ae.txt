### Anomaly Prediction and Detector Heuristics Improvement

The system dates the anomaly prediction and enhances the heuristics of the anomaly detector through feedback. Although the target and instrumented programs may share similar states for detection purposes, shadow honeypots do not attempt to deceive attackers into believing their attack was successful. Instead, attack detection and the decision to decoy attacker sessions are driven solely by the network anomaly detection component.

### Feature Extraction for Intrusion Detection

A variety of feature extraction and classification techniques have been proposed for host- and network-based anomaly detection [56]. Extracting features from encrypted network packets has been extensively studied in the domain of website fingerprinting, where attackers try to identify the websites visited by victims. Users often use anonymous networks, such as Tor, to hide their destination websites [77]. However, attackers can predict destinations by training classifiers on encrypted packets (e.g., packet headers only). Relevant features typically include packet length and direction, summarized as a histogram feature vector. Other features, such as HTML markers, percentage of incoming and outgoing packets, bursts, bandwidth, and website upload time, have also been used [26, 62]. Packet-word vector approaches leverage natural language processing and vector space models to convert packets into word features, enhancing classification [2].

Bi-Di utilizes packet and uni-burst data, introducing bi-directional bursting features for better classification of network streams. For unencrypted data, host-based systems have additionally extracted features from co-occurrences and sequences of system events, such as system calls [15, 55]. DeepDig employs a hybrid scheme that combines both host- and network-based approaches via a modified ensemble technique.

### Conclusion

This paper introduced, implemented, and evaluated a new approach for enhancing web intrusion detection systems with threat data sourced from deceptive, application-layer, software traps. Unlike conventional machine learning-based detection approaches, DeepDig incrementally builds models of legitimate and malicious behavior based on audit streams and traces collected from these traps. This augments the IDS with inexpensive and automatic security-relevant feature extraction capabilities, requiring no additional developer effort beyond routine patching activities. This results in effortless data labeling and supports a new generation of higher-accuracy detection models.
