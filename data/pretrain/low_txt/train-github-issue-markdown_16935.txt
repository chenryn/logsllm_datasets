A few weeks ago, while working on the `master` branch, I was able to use the `factory` keyword in my `_instanceof` Yaml service declarations. This was particularly useful for `DoctrineRepository` instances, as they all required the same factory call. Without this feature, each `DoctrineRepository` would need to duplicate the same factory line, which defeats the purpose of `_instanceof` in reducing code duplication.

To address this, I edited the `DependencyInjection/Loader/YamlFileLoader` file and added `'factory' => 'factory'` to the `$instanceofKeywords` array. This change seemed to work as expected. 

@nicolas-grekas, are there any potential drawbacks to this approach? Are there better solutions or alternatives that I should consider?

Thank you!
