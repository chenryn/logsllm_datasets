### What is smbexec?
**Overview:**
- **Definition:** smbexec is a tool designed for post-exploitation activities.
- **Functionality:** It automates the process of executing commands and transferring files on remote Windows systems using SMB (Server Message Block) protocols.
- **Relevance:** While it does not exploit any zero-day vulnerabilities, its automation capabilities make it a powerful tool for immediate use in post-exploitation scenarios.

**Key Features:**
- **Bash Script:** Written as a Bash script, smbexec leverages `smbclient` and `winexe` for file transfer and command execution.
- **Development Effort:** The tool was developed over one week, with a significant amount of Mountain Dew consumed during the process.
- **Automation:** Automates the creation of obfuscated payloads, enabling bypass of most commercial antivirus solutions.
- **Metasploit Integration:** Generates a Metasploit resource (rc) file and launches a Metasploit listener for ease of use.

---

### Why Write smbexec?
**Motivation:**
- **Antivirus Evasion:** Standard Metasploit payloads using the psexec module were frequently detected by antivirus software, including Trend Micro.
- **Custom Executables:** Custom executables also triggered antivirus alerts due to injection detection.
- **Carnal0wnage Blog Post:** Inspired by a blog post from Carnal0wnage, smbexec was created to upload and execute payloads without triggering antivirus alerts.

**Benefits:**
- **Immediate Shells:** Provides quick access to shells on compromised systems.
- **Obfuscation:** Creates obfuscated payloads that bypass most commercial antivirus solutions.
- **Encryption:** Supports payload encryption using Hyperion Crypter.
- **Ease of Use:** Simplifies the attack process by generating a Metasploit rc file and launching a listener.

### Going Native
**Native Commands:**
- **Winexe:** Similar to Sysinternals' psexec, winexe allows for command execution as SYSTEM.
- **No Payload Required:** No need for a custom payload, making the traffic appear normal to operational security (OPSEC).
- **Successful Logins:** Only successful logins and minimal activity are recorded, reducing the risk of detection.

**Capabilities:**
- **Command Execution:** Execute commands as SYSTEM, with virtually limitless possibilities.
- **Hash Dumping:** Dump hashes from workstations and servers.
- **Volume Shadow Copy:** Create and manage Volume Shadow Copies.
- **UAC Bypass:** Disable or bypass User Account Control (UAC).
- **Account Checking:** Check for Domain Admin (DA) or Enterprise Admin (EA) accounts logged in or running processes.

### smbexec in Action
**Hash Grabbing:**
- **Local and DCC Hashes:** Uses `reg.exe` to save the HKLM SYS, SEC, and SAM registry hives.
- **Creddump:** Converts the saved hives into hash formats compatible with John the Ripper.

**Clear Text Passwords:**
- **WCE Integration:** Incorporates wce.exe with permission from the owner to grab clear text passwords.
- **Automated Process:** Automatically runs as part of the hash grabbing functionality.

**Automated VSC:**
- **Volume Shadow Copy:** Creates a Volume Shadow Copy, grabs the SYS registry key, and extracts hashes from ntds.dit.
- **Cleanup:** Fully automated, including cleanup after the operation.
- **NTDSXtract and libesedb:** Runs automatically if the NTDS.dit and SYS key are successfully grabbed.
- **Output Conversion:** Converts the ntds.output file into a list of hashes in John format and creates a tab-separated credential list.

### Caveats
**Requirements:**
- **Administrative Credentials:** Requires a credential with administrative rights (local or domain).
- **Common Credentials:** Often, `administrator:password` can be used in 9 out of 10 corporate networks.
- **NBNS Spoofing:** Can be used with tools like ettercap for NBNS spoofing.
- **Exploits:** MS08-067 can also be used for initial access.

**Potential Issues:**
- **Service Creation:** Winexe creates a service, which could be flagged by security systems.
- **Antivirus Detection:** Some antivirus software may detect wce, though the included version is obfuscated.
- **Authentication:** Requires authentication over port 139 or 445.
- **Locard's Exchange Principle:** Every action leaves a trace, so caution is advised.
