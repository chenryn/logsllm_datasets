### Packet Loss and Latency Analysis

**Impact of Packet Loss on Demand:**
- **Without BitTorrent:** High packet loss (above 1%) appears to lead to lower demand compared to users with lower packet loss rates.
- **Comparison with India and the US:** Surprisingly, users in India tend to impose lower demand 62% of the time (p-value < 0.001) when compared to users with similar capacities in the US.

**Latency Analysis:**
- **NDT Latencies:** Users in India report much higher latencies to NDT servers than users in other countries. This trend is also observed when measuring latencies to globally popular websites such as Facebook, Google, Windows Live, Yahoo, and YouTube.
- **Figure 11:** This figure describes latency measurements and compares them by user location (India versus the rest of the sample population). The lines labeled "Web" correspond to the median latency to the five popular websites, while "NDT" represents the average latency to the nearest NDT server. Data from two time periods—2011 through 2013 (labeled “’11-’13”) and May 2014 to August 2014 (labeled “’14”)—are included to compare NDT and website latencies.
- **Findings:** For the majority of users in India, we find much higher latencies to both NDT and popular websites compared to the rest of the sample population; nearly every user has a latency longer than 100 ms. Since we rejected the null hypothesis that latency does not affect demand, we believe that the higher latency for users in India contributes to the decrease in network usage.

### Packet Loss Impact on User Demand

**Hypothesis:**
- **H:** Decreased packet loss rates result in higher demand.

**Results:**
- **Table 8:** When comparing users with very low packet loss rates to those with very high packet loss rates, usage tended to be higher on connections with lower packet loss rates. This trend was most pronounced when comparing connections with packet loss rates above 1%.

**Illustration with Indian Users:**
- **Figure 12:** The CDF of the average packet loss during measurements to the NDT servers for all users and users in India shows that users in India had much higher packet loss rates than the general population. As a result, we believe that the lower quality connections (both increased packet loss rates and latency) in India are the probable cause of lower demand on the network.

### Related Work

**Broadband Analysis:**
- **Research Community and Public Interest:** Broadband analysis has attracted significant attention due to its important business and policy implications. Several studies have focused on characterizing the availability and performance of broadband services worldwide [1, 2, 5, 12, 20, 28, 31, 33].
- **Complex Interplay:** Our work explores broadband services in their broader context, evaluating the complex interplay between broadband service characteristics, market features, and user demand.

**Previous Studies:**
- **User Behavior and Network Services:** Studies have examined the relationship between user behavior, network services, and providers. For example, Dobrian et al. [13] show that poor connection quality can negatively impact user experience. Blackburn et al. [3] study how user behavior affects the economics of cellular operators. Chetty et al. [7] explore the effects of usage caps on broadband use. Other factors influencing service demand include weather [6], service capacity [36], and region type [8].

**Experimental Design:**
- **Natural Experiments:** The difficulty of conducting controlled, randomized experiments at Internet scale has been noted. Vern Paxson suggested using natural experiments to explore potential causal relationships with observational data. Krishnan and Sitaraman [21] and Oktay et al. [24] have used quasi-experimental designs (QED) for similar purposes. We opted for natural experiments, as we consider the control and treatment groups to be sufficiently similar to random assignment.

### Summary and Discussion

**Key Findings:**
- **User Behavior and Market Features:** Our findings provide valuable insights into how user behavior and market features shape broadband networks and the Internet. For policymakers, understanding digital inequality requires placing broadband access in a broader context [22].
- **Longitudinal Study:** From 2011 to 2013, subscribers' demand remained relatively constant despite a fourfold increase in global IP traffic. The growth in broadband traffic comes from increased service capacities and a rapidly increasing number of broadband subscribers.
- **Service Capacity and Demand:** There is a strong correlation between service capacity and user demand, with a law of diminishing returns. Usage begins to plateau at approximately 10 Mbps.
- **Connection Quality:** Very long latencies (above 500 ms) and high packet loss rates (starting at 0.1%) clearly result in lower network usage. The relationship between capacity, quality, and demand will evolve with technological improvements and new applications.
- **Pricing and Demand:** Users in markets where broadband connections or additional capacity are more expensive are more likely to impose higher bandwidth demands on their service. For policymakers, this suggests that wider access to medium, high-quality capacity services (around 10 Mbps) may have a more significant impact than focusing on increased service capacity.

### Conclusion

This paper is a first attempt at understanding broadband networks in their broader context, exploring the complex interplay between broadband service characteristics and user behavior. We combine data on broadband usage with relative broadband service pricing from around the world and use alternative experimental designs to move beyond correlation analysis.

**Future Research Directions:**
- **Market Features and Usage:** Further exploration of the interactions between market features and usage, including the impact of economic development and differences in broadband availability in rural and urban areas.
- **National Broadband Deployment Plans:** Leveraging longitudinal data to explore the potential benefits of national broadband deployment plans.
- **Diverse User Groups:** Investigating how different categories of users (e.g., gamers, shoppers, movie-watchers) or more diverse households are impacted by different market and service features.
