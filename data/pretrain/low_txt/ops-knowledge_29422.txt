Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of the text:

"Conducting an instance usage audit for the host `cp-1.slowvm1.tcloud-pg0.utah.cloudlab.us` from 05:00:00 on May 16, 2017, to 06:00:00 on May 16, 2017. A total of 87 instances were audited."

If you need a template version, here it is:

"Conducting an instance usage audit for the host `<host_name>` from `<start_time>` on `<start_date>` to `<end_time>` on `<end_date>`. A total of `<number_of_instances>` instances were audited."
