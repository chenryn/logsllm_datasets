## Abstract
Accurate broadband coverage data is essential for public policy planning and government support programs. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is responsible for maintaining national broadband coverage data. However, observers have criticized the FCC’s broadband maps for overstating availability due to coarse-grained data collection and a low coverage threshold.

We introduce a new approach to building broadband coverage maps: automated large-scale queries to the public availability checking tools offered by major internet service providers (ISPs). We reverse-engineered the coverage tools for nine major ISPs in the U.S., tested over 19 million residential street addresses across nine states for service, and compared the results to the FCC’s maps.

Our findings indicate that the FCC’s coverage data significantly overstates the availability of each ISP’s service, access to any broadband, connection speeds available to consumers, and competition in broadband markets. Additionally, the FCC’s data disproportionately overstates coverage in rural and minority communities. Our results highlight a promising direction for developing more accurate broadband maps and validating coverage reports.

## 1. Introduction
Broadband internet access is crucial for advancing public policy goals such as economic opportunity, educational attainment, and public health [1, 2]. The United States, the European Union, and many other nations and international organizations are prioritizing initiatives to increase broadband availability [3, 4]. Governments worldwide are investing in network infrastructure to close the “digital divide” between those with and without broadband access. This is especially critical during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has necessitated a global shift to working, attending school, and socializing through broadband connections.

Accurate coverage data is fundamental to efforts to close the digital divide. Broadband maps guide both overall funding levels and resource allocation, identifying areas where infrastructure investments are most needed. They also inform related telecommunications policies, such as net neutrality, broadband privacy, municipal broadband, and unbundling, by highlighting potential market failures that justify regulatory intervention.

In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is responsible for maintaining nationwide broadband coverage data [5]. Stakeholders have criticized the FCC’s maps for methodological shortcomings that overstate coverage. There is widespread agreement, including from the FCC’s leadership, that the current maps are not adequately accurate. However, there is little clarity on the specific errors, and the FCC is just beginning to revise its broadband coverage data collection methods.

We explore a new direction for developing broadband coverage maps: automated large-scale measurement of the representations that ISPs make to prospective customers. Every major ISP in the U.S. offers a broadband availability tool (BAT) to check whether an address is eligible for service. We systematically submit residential address queries to BATs and derive a dataset of U.S. fixed broadband coverage. Our contributions include a rigorous methodology for generating a coverage dataset from BATs and a comparative analysis that estimates errors in the FCC’s maps.

## 2. Background and Related Work
### 2.1 Background on U.S. Broadband Maps
For over two decades, the FCC has been responsible for encouraging broadband deployment and competition in the U.S. [6]. As part of this mission, the FCC requires ISPs to file coverage reports via a process called Form 477 [7]. The FCC compiles these reports into a dataset used to allocate infrastructure subsidies and evaluate potential regulation. The FCC also makes its coverage data and an interactive national broadband map available online [9].

Our work focuses on the Form 477 data for fixed broadband, such as fiber, cable, and DSL. These ISPs are required to submit biannual reports about service that exceeds 200 kbps in either direction [10]. There are several notable shortcomings in the FCC’s current fixed coverage methods:
1. **Census Block Level Data Collection:** Census blocks can encompass nearly a thousand housing units (especially in urban areas) or hundreds to thousands of square miles (especially in rural areas) [11].
2. **All-or-Nothing Reporting:** If an ISP reaches one address in a census block, it reports coverage for the entire block [12].
3. **Potential vs. Actual Coverage:** Even if an ISP does not currently reach a census block, it still reports coverage if it could soon provide service to an address in the block [12].

These methods lead to inaccurate coverage analysis because the resulting broadband maps do not account for incomplete coverage within census blocks and do not distinguish between actual and potential coverage. When the FCC conducts analysis using these maps, it treats coverage for the geography, residences, and individuals within each census block as all-or-nothing. Independent analyses relying on the FCC’s coverage data similarly assume complete coverage in a census block when reported [16–18].

Erroneous coverage reports are another source of inaccuracy. In 2019, FCC staff conducted on-the-ground tests of the Verizon, T-Mobile, and U.S. Cellular mobile networks in 12 states [19, 20]. The staff report concluded that Form 477 data from all three providers so “generally overstated” coverage and performance that the data was not “generally reliable.” Earlier this year, AT&T notified the FCC that it had mistakenly reported fixed coverage since 2017 in over 3,500 census blocks across 20 states [21]. Also, the FCC initiated penalty proceedings against BarrierFree, a local fixed ISP in New York, for submitting years of inaccurate coverage data [22].

### 2.2 Related Work
There have been three notable efforts to examine the accuracy of the FCC’s fixed broadband coverage data:
1. **Microsoft Study (2019):** Microsoft measured the network speed for users of its services, geolocated users to ZIP codes based on IP addresses, and compared the resulting usage data to the FCC’s maps [31]. The study estimated that, as of November 2019, about 157 million Americans were not using broadband service at the FCC’s benchmark minimum of 25 Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload. Microsoft inferred that the FCC’s maps pervasively overstate coverage [32].
2. **BroadbandNow Study (Concurrent):** BroadbandNow manually queried BATs for nine ISPs using 11,663 addresses, totaling 20,065 address-ISP combinations. The study found that 19.6% of address-ISP combinations resulted in a BAT response other than service available, and 13.0% of addresses did not have any relevant BAT indicating service. The report inferred that the number of Americans without broadband access is double the FCC’s estimates [33].
3. **CostQuest Associates Pilot Study (2019):** CostQuest developed a “fabric” of serviceable building structures using proprietary methods and evaluated the accuracy of the FCC’s broadband maps in Missouri and Virginia [34]. The report concluded that the FCC’s data overstated participating ISP coverage for 16% of structures in Missouri and 19% of structures in Virginia.

Other government agencies, such as the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and the California Public Utilities Commission, are also compiling broadband coverage data [36, 37].

## 3. Methodology
### 3.1 Selecting ISPs
We studied nine major ISPs: AT&T, CenturyLink, Charter, Comcast, Consolidated, Cox, Frontier, Verizon, and Windstream. These ISPs represent most of the broadband market, reaching over 90% of the population with access to broadband in the states we studied. Each of these ISPs has a BAT that can be reliably queried with residential addresses [52–60].

### 3.2 Selecting Residential Addresses
After identifying the ISPs, we compiled a dataset of residential addresses for our queries and analysis using USDOT, USPS, and U.S. Census Bureau data. Table 1 presents counts for each step in our address validation process. Our dataset includes nearly 20 million addresses served by at least one ISP and 19.4 million addresses served by at least one major ISP.

### 3.3 Reverse Engineering BATs
We reverse-engineered the BATs for the nine major ISPs. We examined each BAT with test queries, developing a preliminary taxonomy of distinct response types and corresponding outcomes (e.g., the address is covered, not covered, or unrecognized).

### 3.4 Querying BATs at Scale
We conducted automated data collection, querying the BATs with residential addresses from U.S. Department of Transportation and U.S. Postal Service data. In total, we queried over 19 million addresses across nine states.

### 3.5 Creating BAT Response Taxonomy
We iteratively added new BAT response types to our taxonomy and evaluated the accuracy of our final taxonomy by placing test calls to ISPs. We then used our taxonomy to convert the BAT responses into a coverage dataset.

### 3.6 Analyzing the Dataset
We analyzed our dataset in comparison to the FCC’s coverage data, contributing the most rigorous large-scale evaluation of the FCC’s maps to date. Our results demonstrate that the FCC’s data significantly overstates coverage by each ISP, access to any broadband service, access to higher-speed broadband, and access to competing providers. We also found that the FCC’s data disproportionately overstates coverage in rural and minority communities.

## 4. Results and Discussion
Our results highlight the need for more accurate broadband maps and validate the effectiveness of our methodology. The FCC’s data significantly overstates broadband coverage, particularly in rural and minority communities. Our approach, which involves large-scale automated queries to ISP BATs, provides a more accurate and granular representation of broadband availability.

## 5. Conclusion and Future Work
This study demonstrates a new and effective method for mapping U.S. broadband coverage. Future work will focus on expanding the scope of our analysis to more states and incorporating additional data sources to further refine our coverage dataset. We also plan to explore the use of machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of our methodology.
