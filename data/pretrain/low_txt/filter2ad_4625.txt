**Abstract:**
This paper introduces WebIDS, a learning-based anomaly detection system designed for web applications. The primary goals of WebIDS are to enhance the decision-making process, reduce false positive rates, and enable distributed detection.

**Keywords:**
Anomaly detection, Correlation, Web application

### 1. Introduction
In recent years, attacks on web applications and services have surged, yet effective intrusion detection approaches remain limited. Key challenges in anomaly-based systems include improving the decision-making process, reducing the high number of false alarms caused by unusual activities, and addressing the need for distributed intrusion detection. Our research aims to develop an efficient, distributed anomaly detection system specifically tailored for the security of web applications.

### 2. Our Proposal: WebIDS
WebIDS analyzes HTTP GET requests logged by Apache web servers. The analysis is based on a multi-model approach [5] that implements ten statistical algorithms:
- Attribute length
- Attribute character distribution
- Structural inference
- Token finder
- Attribute presence or absence
- Attribute order
- Access frequency
- Inter-request delay
- Invocation order
- Anomaly history (which tracks alarms)

The system requires no special configuration and operates through autonomous learning. A non-naive Bayesian network [3] is used for the decision process, classifying events more accurately and incorporating confidence information from the models. At the root node, the event classification [6] distinguishes between a normal state and five types of web attack states:
- Authentication
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Command execution
- Denial of Service (DoS)
- Other attacks

WebIDS improves its performance after each log analysis by filtering out false positives using an alarm clustering technique [2]. The anomaly history model includes a cooperation feature that enables the system to achieve alarm and event correlation [4]. The Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format (IDMEF) [1] is used to share alarm information between systems.

### 3. Experimental Results
WebIDS has been implemented in an IT company in Luxembourg and demonstrated good detection rates:
- Sensitivity: 96.02%
- Specificity: 99.99%
- Reliability: 99.94%

The false positive rate (0.01422%) is lower than those observed in similar systems. However, these results should be interpreted with caution, as only a small number of anomalies were observed during the experimental period, and comparisons with existing systems were not based on the same dataset.

### 4. Conclusion and Future Work
In conclusion, the proposed cooperative anomaly-based intrusion detection system, WebIDS, is both innovative and efficient. It enhances the decision-making process, reduces false positive rates, and facilitates cooperation between systems, thereby meeting the defined challenges. Future work will focus on deploying WebIDS in a more widely distributed environment, with ongoing functional and technical improvements to support this goal.
