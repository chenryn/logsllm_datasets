**ATT&CK ID:** T1037.003  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Network Logon Script

Adversaries may leverage network logon scripts, which are automatically executed during the logon initialization process, to establish persistence within a network. These scripts can be assigned via Active Directory or Group Policy Objects (GPOs) and run with the privileges of the user to whom they are assigned. Depending on the configuration of the network, the execution of one of these scripts could affect multiple systems, potentially even all systems in the network.
