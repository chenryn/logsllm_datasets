### Web Tracking Technologies: Stateful and Stateless Approaches

Web tracking technologies can be broadly categorized into two types: stateful and stateless. 

#### Stateful Tracking
Stateful tracking techniques store information on the user's computer, which is later retrieved to recognize the user. The most common form of stateful tracking is through third-party cookies. Recent research has shown that even if users delete these cookies, they can be "respawned" [7, 27]. Additionally, cookies are often synchronized among different data brokers, allowing for the mapping and exchange of user profiles [13, 24]. Several studies have documented the use of various stateful trackers on popular websites [7, 17, 26, 28].

#### Stateless Tracking
Stateless tracking technologies, on the other hand, allow trackers to recognize users without storing any information on the user's machine. One such method is device fingerprinting, which collects information about the user's browser and operating system (OS) properties to distinguish users based on these characteristics [11]. In 2010, Eckersley first demonstrated the effectiveness of this technology through the Panopticlick project [12]. Subsequent research has revealed that device fingerprinting is now widely used by tracking companies [6, 21]. With the advancement of web standards and HTML5, more sophisticated fingerprinting techniques have emerged, utilizing Canvas API, WebRTC, and AudioContext [13]. Recent developments have also introduced cross-device fingerprinting methods [9, 10]. Another recent study showed that web browsers can be detected via the extensions installed by the user and the websites where the user is logged in [14].

### Legal Compliance and Privacy Protection
Website owners must comply with legal regulations, such as the upcoming EU ePrivacy regulation, which holds them liable for third-party tracking on their sites. To address this, platforms like Social Share Privacy [25] allow website developers to include social widgets while disabling any requests to third parties until the user clicks on the button. Researchers have also proposed a server-side technique to protect against web tracking. This method involves setting up two additional servers that rewrite and redirect the original web application requests, thereby automatically removing third-party tracking from the content [30].
