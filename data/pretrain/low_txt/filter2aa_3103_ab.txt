## Maelstrom Game Concept
### Overview
- **Objective**: A board game designed to simulate and teach cybersecurity attack and defense strategies.
- **Components**:
  - **Attacker Deck**: 60+ unique attacker cards.
  - **Defender Deck**: 70+ unique defender cards.
  - **Threat Actor Chips**: 12 unique chips, face down.
  - **Act on Objectives**: 11 unique objectives, face down in the middle.
  - **Game Board**: Based on the Lockheed Martin Attack Lifecycle.

### Game Play
- **Versions**:
  - **Easy**: Dealt cards.
  - **Tactical**: Actively pick cards.
  - **Strategic**: Buy cards.
- **Rules**:
  - Choose the number of attacker players.
  - Attackers choose their Threat Actor and Act on Objectives.
  - Attackers aim to progress to their objectives.
  - Defenders aim to prevent progression.
  - Defender wins if they set the attacker pieces back to Delivery 3 times or Recon 2 times.

### Use Cases
- **Education**: Teaching the Attack Lifecycle and building a security mindset.
- **Demonstration**: Mini tabletop exercises and investigator pattern recognition.
- **Evangelism**: Gamification as a marketing tool to reach non-security professionals.

### Next Steps
- **Pursue**: Submit work for upcoming conferences and get input.
- **Map to Current Attack Patterns**: Develop and play games.
- **Lessons from Games**: Produce lessons and insights.
- **Digitization**: Create an open-source framework and expansion packs.
- **Non-Technical Game Development**: Develop versions for kids.
- **Community Involvement**: Allow others to contribute and update decks.
