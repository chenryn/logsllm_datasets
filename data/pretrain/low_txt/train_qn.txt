### Global Changes
- **Typographical and Grammatical Corrections**: Several pages have been corrected for typographical and grammatical errors.
- **Consistent Terminology**: The term "glibc" is now consistently used to refer to the GNU C Library.
- **Error Ordering**: Errors are now listed alphabetically in various pages.
- **Spelling and Formatting Fixes**: Various pages have received spelling and formatting corrections as per [Debian Bug #439560](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=439560).

### New Pages
- **timeradd.3**: Description of `timeradd()`, `timersub()`, `timerclear()`, `timerisset()`, and `timercmp()` macros for operating on `struct timeval`.

### Removed Pages
- **fdatasync.2**: Material from `fdatasync(2)` has been moved to `fsync.2`. The page now contains a link to `fsync.2`.

### New Links
- **clock_getres.2**, **clock_gettime.2**, **clock_settime.2**: Link to `man3/clock_getres.3`.
- **fdatasync.2**: Link to `fsync.2`.
- **fdopendir.3**: Link to `opendir.3`.
