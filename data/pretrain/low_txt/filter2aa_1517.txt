# DEFCON 20: Insecurity Design in Safes and Containers

## Overview
This presentation examines the design flaws in security products, particularly gun safes, which have real consequences for protecting lives and property. The focus is on the inadequacy of current standards and the misrepresentations made by manufacturers, dealers, and retailers.

## Gun Safes: A Case Study
### Key Points
- **Purpose**: Gun safes and property safes are sold to store weapons.
- **Security Concerns**: Many of these safes are not secure.
- **Analysis of Insecurity**:
  - **Boltworks and Mechanisms**
  - **Biometrics**
  - **Key Locks**

### Security Representations
- **Claims**:
  - Secure for storing weapons
  - Certified by the California Department of Justice (DOJ)
  - Protect children from accessing guns

### Manufacturers, Security, and Engineering
- **Common Issues**:
  - Many manufacturers lack understanding of bypass techniques.
  - Imported products often prioritize cost over security.
  - Even large, reputable companies may sell insecure products.
  - Misleading claims by manufacturers, dealers, and retailers.

### Insecurity Engineering: A Definition
- **Intersection of Mechanical and Security Engineering**:
  - Requires both mechanical and security expertise.
  - Understanding of bypass techniques and designing against them at all stages.
  - Developing a new way of thinking among manufacturers.
  - Problem: Engineers know how to make things work but not how to break them.

### Myths About Security and Product Design
- **Common Misconceptions**:
  - Patented does not mean secure.
  - Engineers believe their product is secure.
  - Long-standing products are assumed to be secure.
  - No known bypass tools or techniques.
  - Meeting or exceeding standards.
  - Certification by testing labs.
  - Government approval.
  - Absence of consumer complaints.

### Standards: The Problem
- **Inadequate Standards**:
  - Products can meet all standards but still be easily opened.
  - Standards are outdated and do not test for many methods of attack.
  - Consumers rely on these standards for security.
  - Meeting standards does not guarantee security.
  - Standards can mislead the public.
  - Gun lock and safe standards, including those set by the California DOJ, are inadequate and do not provide adequate protection.

### California DOJ Standards
- **Section 977.50 of the CA Code of Regulations**:
  - **Containment and Storage**: Safes must fully contain firearms and provide secure storage.
  - **Locking System**: Must include a mechanical or electronic combination lock with at least 10,000 possible combinations.
  - **Boltwork**: Minimum of three steel locking bolts, each at least Â½ inch thick.
  - **Construction**: Exterior walls must be at least 12-gauge thick steel.
  - **Door Hinges**: Must be protected to prevent door removal.

### Real-World Testing
- **Current Standards**:
  - Do not protect consumers.
  - Lack testing for covert entry and mechanical bypass techniques.
  - Not reflective of real-world scenarios, especially involving children.
  - Allow certification of gun safes that can be easily opened by children.
  - Most states rely on California as a model.

### Retailers' Role
- **Major Retailers**:
  - Often unaware or unconcerned about security issues.
  - Contacted four major retailers; only one showed concern.
  - No action taken by any of them.
  - Example: Stack-On showed no interest.

### Misrepresentations About Security
- **False Claims**:
  - California DOJ certified.
  - Reliable security.
  - Safe for securing guns.
  - Cannot be opened by children.
  - Only way to open is by breaking it.
  - Trusted by consumers.
  - TSA approved.

### Dealers Misleading the Public
- **Case Study: Detective Owens**:
  - **Incident**: In 2003, a deputy's son shot his 10-year-old sister with a service weapon.
  - **Mandate**: Clark County Sheriff's Office mandated the use of gun safes.
  - **Purchase**: Stack-On safes were purchased for $36 each.
  - **Tragedy**: On September 15, 2010, a three-year-old child accessed a safe, resulting in a fatal shooting.
  - **Investigation**: No DNA tests, GSR tests, forensic analysis, or expertise in how the safe was opened.
  - **Outcome**: Father fired 14 months later for speaking up about defective safes.

### Forensic Investigation
- **Examination**:
  - Analyzed two safes from the same batch.
  - Examined bolt mechanism, solenoid, and high-speed video documentation.
  - Analyzed similar safes from AMSEC, GUNVAULT, and BULLDOG.
  - Contacted STACK-ON and expanded the inquiry to all models.

### Defective Designs
- **Common Defects**:
  - Push-button keypad locks.
  - Fingerprint swipe reader biometric.
  - Fingerprint image reader biometric.
  - Multi-button combination.
  - Key bypass (wafer or tubular lock).
  - All could be bypassed easily without special tools or expertise.

### Bypass Techniques
- **Covert Entry Methods**:
  - Shims.
  - Straws from McDonald's.
  - Screwdrivers.
  - Pieces of brass from Ace Hardware.
  - Paperclips.
  - Fingers.

### Specific Models
- **Stack-On PC 650**:
  - Remove rubber cover.
  - Activate latch.
  - Easy latch access.
  - Bypass program button.
  - Re-program the code.
  - Shim the wafer lock.

- **Stack-On PDS 500**:
  - Make a hole and manipulate the mechanism.
  - Bypass solenoid with wire.
  - Wafer lock bypass with shims and paper clips.

- **Stack-On Biometric**:
  - False perception of security.
  - Fingerprint readers do not ensure security.
  - Bypass by pushing the reader and dislodging the module.
  - Access the solenoid and open the safe with a wire.

- **Stack-On QAS 1200B**:
  - Open with a paperclip.
  - Glue used as a security measure.
  - High-tech tool: paperclip.

- **Stack-On QAS-710**:
  - Motorized mechanism.
  - Electronic keypad.
  - Open with a straw, brass shim, or screwdriver.
  - Reprogram the combination by accessing the reset switch.

- **GUNVAULT GV2000S**:
  - Open the safe with various methods.

- **BULLDOG BD1500**:
  - Open the safe with various methods.

### Conclusion
- **Competent Security Engineering Matters**:
  - Secure products.
  - Protection of assets, lives, and property.
  - Consequences of defectively designed products.
  - Liability.
  - If you own one of these safes, consider the risks.
