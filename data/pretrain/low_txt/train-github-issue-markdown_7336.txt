The `choices` option can be a nested array, and the `entity` type includes a `group_by` option. These features allow entities to be grouped within HTML `optgroup` tags, but currently, this functionality is only supported for `select` widgets.

Shouldn't this grouping also be applied to `checkboxes` and `radios`? For these input types, the groups could be represented using `fieldset` and `legend` elements. This enhancement could be beneficial for the use case described in issue #5286.
