## Abstract
Communities of interest (COIs) have been applied in various environments, from characterizing online buying behavior to detecting fraud in telephone networks. The common thread is that an individual's historical COI can predict future behavior and the behavior of other COI members. This paper introduces a methodology for evaluating COIs within IP networks. We define a COI as a collection of interacting hosts and apply our methodology using data from a large enterprise network over an eleven-week period. We study the distribution and stability of COI sizes, evaluate heuristics to determine stable core sets of COIs, and assess the communication not captured by these core COI sets.

## 1. Introduction
Data networks are growing in size and complexity, with new services, mobility, and wireless communication making management, security, and understanding increasingly challenging. Network management platforms and monitoring infrastructures often provide little relief in untangling these complex environments.

In this paper, we aim to understand host-level communities of interest (COIs) in data networks. A COI is defined as a collection of entities sharing a common goal or environment. Using data from a large enterprise network, we construct community graphs representing host communications. Our hypothesis is that the behavior of a collection of hosts has a significant regularity and structure. Once illuminated, this structure can form parsimonious models for management policies.

The study seeks to determine if COIs are a good approximation of these models. If true, COIs will be useful for:
- **Network Management**: Aggregating similar hosts for management.
- **Resource Allocation**: Allocating resources by community to ensure fairness and availability.
- **Traffic Engineering**: Informing capacity planning and prioritization of network resource use.
- **Security**: Detecting malicious activity through deviations from normal behavior.

Previous works have shown that digital domains exhibit the small-world phenomenon, indicating rational structure. We hypothesize that host communication reflects similar structure and rationality, informing host management. Tan et al. [5] focused on local network behavior, while Cortes et al. [6] identified fraudulent behavior through COIs in telecommunications.

This paper extends these works by applying COI concepts to data networks. In Section 2, we outline our methodology, and in Section 3, we present our results. We conclude in Section 4 with a summary and future work.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Communities of Interest
We define a COI in a data network as a collection of interacting hosts. Initially, we explore the broad COI definition, considering all hosts a target-host interacts with. We then narrow this to a core COI, focusing on regular interactions. Two example definitions of a core COI are:
- **Popularity**: A host is part of the COI if the percentage of target-hosts interacting with it exceeds a threshold over a time period.
- **Frequency**: A host is part of the COI if the target-host interacts with it at least once every small time-period within a larger time period.

The Popularity COI captures interactions performed by a large part of the user population, while the Frequency COI captures frequent interactions. These definitions become more inclusive as the threshold decreases or the bin-size increases.

### 2.2 Data Collection and Pre-processing
We collected eleven weeks of flow records from a large enterprise network with over 400 distributed sites and 50,000 users. The data was collected using the Gigascope network monitor, capturing traffic from 300 hosts. We excluded external hosts and weekend data, resulting in over 4.5 TByte of network traffic.

Pre-processing steps include:
- **DHCP Handling**: Using DHCP logs to map IP addresses to unique host identifiers.
- **Flow Record Processing**: Combining flows spanning multiple intervals and unidirectional flows into bidirectional interactions.
- **Removing Unwanted Traffic**: Cleaning the data to remove suspected unwanted traffic, such as network scans or worm activity.

## 3. Results
After pre-processing, the final dataset consisted of 6.1 million edge-records representing 151 local hosts and 3823 internal hosts. We present the COI analysis, including the distribution and stability of COI sizes, the evaluation of heuristics for determining stable core COI sets, and the assessment of communication not captured by these core COI sets.

## 4. Conclusion
This paper presents a methodology for evaluating COIs in data networks and applies it to a large enterprise network. The results show the potential of COIs for network management, resource allocation, traffic engineering, and security. Future work will focus on refining COI definitions and expanding the application to broader network environments.
