### Potential Data Leak and Mitigation Strategies

We have determined that no technical or cybersecurity measures currently exist to fully mitigate the risk of a potential data leak. Therefore, this issue should be addressed through other security measures. Within the framework, these measures could include:

- **ID.AM-4**: Cataloging external information systems, which must include the manufacturer's equipment.
- **ID.AM-5**: Prioritizing resources based on criticality (the existence of a practical attack increases criticality).
- **ID.AM-6**: Establishing cybersecurity roles for the workforce and third-party stakeholders, such as outsourced manufacturers.

Further subcategories can be applied to specific organizations and manufacturing arrangements. For example, subcategories of Supply Chain Risk Management specify routine assessments of suppliers for compliance with contractual obligations.

The Framework can provide a roadmap for addressing newly emerged threats, such as side-channel attacks, within the constraints of business objectives and organizational risk tolerance. The examples provided here are not exhaustive, and future work will be required to address this threat within the framework. While encryption may be insufficient in some scenarios, business operations must remain secure. Security measures must extend beyond encryption when it is not sufficient for the task.

### Implications for Standards

The attack described in this paper demonstrates that Additive Manufacturing (AM) is susceptible to vulnerabilities that go beyond those addressed in well-known cybersecurity and cyber-physical security standards, such as those referenced by NIST. The processes for creating AM-specific digital representations, the subsequent transformations they undergo, and their eventual realization as physical objects create vulnerabilities not present in other manufacturing systems.

These vulnerabilities are not limited to a single location and may exist across the supply chain. A standards-based approach to identifying and addressing these vulnerabilities would help organizations better secure their AM processes.

A publicly available standard for AM should provide a schematic reference for the design-to-product transformation, with detailed information models of each step of the process and associated security threats. These information models must break down the larger activity of "AM part production" into sub-activities, similar to [16]. A standards-based approach to modeling the information flow of AM processes will bring together the industry's knowledge of when and where security threats can exist and how they can be exploited. This could lead to documentation of threat models, attack surfaces, and vulnerabilities in AM, providing similar benefits to the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) List, a widely used list of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and their identifiers [13].

In the scenario described in this paper, the sub-activity of a part build is exploited to compromise an AM part while bypassing cybersecurity measures. A baseline reference of the part build sub-activity would include the exposure of design data via this side-channel. Standards can inform organizations by enumerating the attack surfaces associated with AM activities, thereby helping to identify vulnerabilities and supporting risk analyses. Such standards would enable organizations to develop informed policies to better secure their own systems.

### Conclusion

To support distributed manufacturing with AM, multiple cybersecurity models have emerged to protect digital representations of designs and other technical data. Under a Man-at-the-End threat model, which applies in the case of a malicious service provider or insider, the adversary's possession of the target hardware makes side-channel attacks possible. In this paper, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of a side-channel approach to technical data theft.

The instrumentation system and approach developed in this paper were able to reconstruct complete printed parts entirely from the electrical side-channel, without any information about the digital design files. Many of our tested models were reproduced with no noticeable aberrations, resulting in functionally identical counterfeit versions. Others demonstrated the limitations of a fully automated reconstruction but still contained enough information that a dedicated manual process could recover the object in full. All observed errors were in the form of fixed-size shifts in the 1-10 step range, corresponding to 0.16-1.6mm; these can be identified and repaired manually. These results constitute a significant step forward in the art of AM reconstruction.

Current defensive technologies would not be able to detect or prevent this attack. Cybersecurity measures would be circumvented. The mutual-information reduction techniques of Al-Faruque [5] or Chhetri [12] will be difficult to apply when the sampled channel is in direct control of the actuator. Future countermeasures research might investigate impedance monitoring to detect probing, creating signal artifacts that impede reconstruction, or identifying reconstructed products. Interesting work has been done in the industrial controls space on control signal watermarks to detect spoofed sensor readings [28, 34], which might be adapted for use here. However, improvements to the approach could make such solutions unworkable. The most effective countermeasures available today appear to be the non-technical, procedural controls discussed in Section 7.2.

In a direct follow-up, we intend to test the applicability of this approach across multiple FDM printers, both of the same and differing models. If the attack is portable between different models of printer and tolerant of drift in equipment behavior over time, it significantly changes the economics of the attack. This would enable a business model in which an adversary develops this technique and sells it to less-skilled malicious insiders or manufacturers, much as is common in cyber-attacks today.

While this paper demonstrates the attack for an FDM 3D printer, the same approach should be viable for other AM processes and actuators. We believe that further refinement can push the accuracy of this approach to 100%, producing reconstructions functionally identical to the original part. Consequently, this attack has direct and serious implications for the AM outsourcing model. No purely digital system of ensuring intellectual property protection is sufficient against a Man-at-the-End attack. Our work demonstrates that when side-channels are exploited, encryption is futile.
