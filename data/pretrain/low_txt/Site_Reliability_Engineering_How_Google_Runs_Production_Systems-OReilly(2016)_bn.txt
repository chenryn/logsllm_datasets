### AnnotationConsistencyTooEventual
- **Paging Frequency**: This issue has triggered 5 pages this week, likely due to cross-regional replication delays between Bigtables.
- **Investigation Status**: Ongoing. Refer to bug 4821600 for more details.
- **Expected Fix**: No immediate fix is anticipated. To reduce unactionable alerts, the acceptable consistency threshold will be raised.

### Nonpaging Events
- **Status**: None

### Monitoring Changes and/or Silences
- **AnnotationConsistencyTooEventual**: The acceptable delay threshold has been increased from 60 seconds to 180 seconds. Refer to bug 4821600. (TODO: martym)

### Planned Production Changes
- **USA-1 Cluster Maintenance**:
  - **Date Range**: October 29, 2015, to November 2, 2015.
  - **Impact**: Traffic will automatically reroute to other clusters in the region. No action required.

### Resources
- **Resource Allocation**:
  - **Current Status**: Additional server instances were borrowed to respond to the sonnet++ incident. These resources will be returned next week.
  - **Utilization**:
    - CPU: 60% (up from 40% last week)
    - RAM: 75% (up from 70% last week)
    - Disk: 44% (up from 40% last week)

### Key Service Metrics
- **Latency**:
  - **99th Percentile Latency**: 88 ms (below the SLO target of 100 ms)
- **Availability**:
  - **Current Availability**: 86.95% (below the SLO target of 99.99%)

### Discussion / Project Updates
- **Project Molière**:
  - **Launch Date**: Launching in two weeks.

### New Action Items
- **TODO(martym)**: Raise the AnnotationConsistencyTooEventual threshold.
- **TODO(docbrown)**: Return instance count to normal and return borrowed resources.
