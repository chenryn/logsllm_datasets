## EMV, Carder Systems, and Automating Cashout
- **EMV Standard**:
  - Developed in France in the 1980s by Europay, MasterCard, and Visa.
  - A small chip on the card managed by EMVCo.
  - Replaces magnetic stripe cards.
  - Liability shift in the USA from 2015 to 2017.
- **Attacks on EMV**:
  - Relay attacks on physical cards.
  - New methods for distributing stolen credit card data with a 1-minute shelf life.
  - Next-generation ATM security feature attacks.
  - Examination of ATM communication backends with financial institutions.
  - Introduction of La-Cara: an automated cashout machine (ACM).

## What is EMV?
- **Development**: France, 1980s.
- **Companies**: Europay, MasterCard, Visa.
- **Feature**: Small chip on the card.
- **Management**: EMVCo.
- **Replacement**: Magnetic stripe cards.
- **Liability Shift**: 2015-2017 in the USA.

## Historical Context
- **Past**: Your grandfather's BINs.
- **Present**: Cashing out on the backend.

## Delimitation and Timeframes
- **Delimitation**:
  - 5-digit delimitation within a 60-second block.
  - Transaction challenge for device 1.
  - Tunnel ID internal connection.
  - Information types: PIN, PAN, Limit, Flags, Feedback, Success, Analytics.
  - Close connection.
- **Timeframe**:
  - 60-second blocks for each step.
  - Acceptable timeframe for delimiting strings.

## Types of Credit Card Data
- **Data Sold in Real-Time**:
  - Static magnetic data (Track 1, 2, 3).
  - EMV (DDA Dynamic Authentication, CDA Combined Data Authentication).
  - 13.56 MHz RFID NFC (non-token-based).
  - Rejects cards with flags not set for ATM.
  - Includes PIN number and assumed ATM limit.

## Carder Sites and Data Flow
- **Small Carder Site**:
  - Leased gear.
  - Mules/store employees.
  - Independents/small breaches.
- **Main Carder Site**:
  - Initial transaction request.
  - Hold for round two.
  - Relaying card data over a distance with a 1-minute window.
  - Four stages of EMV transactions captured and released into a tunnel.
  - Cashout device regurgitates the exact "send and receive" from a shimmed device.
  - PIN information passed in real-time to the cashout device.
  - POS limit does not count against the ATM daily limit.

## Shimmer vs. Skimmer
- **Shimmers Found in the Wild**:
  - Cashout device standalone?

## Introducing La-Cara
- **Why Automate?**:
  - People are untrustworthy.
  - Cashout crews brag on social media.
  - Busted humans rat out their accomplices.
  - Machines donâ€™t have Twitter accounts.
- **Defcon Theme**: Rise of the Machines.
- **La-Cara**: An automated cashout machine.

## Making of La-Cara
- **Personal Note**:
  - The smiling individual in the reflection is me.

## Building Your Own Banking Backend
- **Off-Branch ATM DES Keys Account Signing**:
  - Each account signed with banking keys.
  - Each card transaction in the demo is signed.
  - Skimmer generation signed with Field 55 training.

## EMV Transaction Process
- **Steps**:
  1. Terminal (POS/ATM)
  2. Card/Device
  3. Acquirer
  4. Bank Issuer

## Methods of Past and Present
- **Camera Method**:
  - PIN overlay.
  - Unencrypted PIN trace.
- **New Automation**:
  - Probing networks and card settings.
  - Estimating POS/ATM limits from a BIN number.
  - Shimming POS systems.
  - Habits of putting EMV cards in early.
  - ATM cashout is uninterrupted.
  - Shimming bank front desks, gas pumps, and electric charge stations (2017+).

## Special Thanks
- **Family and Friends**:
  - My wife and kids, Jesus, Barnaby Jack, Samy Kamkar, Russell Ryan, Zack Anderson, Alessandro Chiesa, PhatPat, Econic, Total Downer, and random people in chatrooms and forums.

## Demo of Automation
- **Prop Money**: $50,000.
- **Transaction Amount**: $500-$900 per transaction.
- **Maximum Transactions**: 60.
- **Transaction Time**: 18-22 seconds.
- **Card Challenge Auth**.
- **Amount Selection Based on PAN/BIN**.
- **PIN Entered/Downgraded When Available**.
- **Money Dispensed**.
