### Efficient and Organized Development with SWAP

Efficient and organized development is a fundamental necessity, and the Semantic Web Application Platform (SWAP) represents an ideal step in this direction. The SWAP layers can be extended and merged to meet the needs of most multi-tiered business applications through the use of ontologies and web service integration. A detailed analysis of merging these layers for different business requirements is part of ongoing and future research. We plan to develop additional testbed applications using SWAP and conduct empirical studies to evaluate its effectiveness.

### Technical Background

#### 1. Knowledge and Content Technologies in the EU's Sixth Framework Programme

Knowledge and content technologies are key research themes under the Semantic-based Knowledge and Content Systems Strategic Objective (SO) of the Information Society Technologies (IST) Priority, a major component of the Sixth Framework Programme (FP6).

**Council Decision:**
A specific programme for research, technological development, and demonstration aims to improve the usability of IST applications and services and access to the knowledge they embody, encouraging wider adoption and faster deployment. Integration issues related to multimedia research technologies will also be addressed.

- **Knowledge Technologies and Digital Content:** The goal is to provide automated solutions for creating and organizing virtual knowledge spaces (e.g., collective memories, digital libraries) to stimulate new content and media services. Research will focus on technologies for acquiring, modeling, navigating, retrieving, representing, and visualizing knowledge, as well as interpreting and sharing it. These functions will be integrated into new semantic-based and context-aware systems, including cognitive and agent-based tools. Extensible knowledge resources and ontologies will facilitate service interoperability and enable next-generation semantic web applications. Additionally, research will address the design, creation, management, and publishing of multimedia content across fixed and mobile networks and devices, with the ability to self-adapt to user expectations.

#### 2. Current Status within IST

The IST Work Programme for 2005-2006 aims to continue the main research lines of WP 2003-2004, with some focused activities driving the convergence of knowledge, semantic, and digital media technologies. This SO will call for project proposals under the 4th IST call, with successful submissions likely to lead to contracts effective from January 2006.

- **First Two IST Calls:** Yielded 33 projects totaling around €137M (EU funding). Many projects began in January 2004 and will continue until the end of 2007, while others will deliver results by the end of 2005. Most projects from the second call were underway by October 2004, with a typical duration of 3-4 years. For more details, visit [http://www.cordis.lu/ist/directorate_e/kmcc/index.htm](http://www.cordis.lu/ist/directorate_e/kmcc/index.htm).
- **Expected Future Calls:** Will lead to fewer, more ambitious projects. The SO budget envelope for the 4th call is approximately €110-120M. New proposals should aim to progress beyond or complement topics covered in ongoing projects.

#### 3. Work Programme 2005-2006 - Consultation Process and Update

In the IST Work Programme for 2003-2004, knowledge and content-related research themes were presented under the SOs 'Semantic-based Knowledge Systems' and 'Cross-media Content for Leisure and Entertainment.' To prepare for the second phase, the work programme was reassessed based on progress, market conditions, and ongoing scientific research, with the help of external experts.

- **Recommendations:** The Knowledge SO should be fine-tuned, emphasizing (i) knowledge acquisition and modeling and (ii) knowledge sharing and use. Particular emphasis was placed on achieving higher analytical and interpretative capabilities across all content types and developing semantic-based systems for inter-organizational knowledge sharing and collaboration.
- **Content RTD:** A promising long-term paradigm addresses intelligent, self-descriptive, user/context-aware, and adaptive content objects, driving the move towards all-digital forms of content for all media and contexts of use.
- **Merged SOs:** The Knowledge and Content SOs were merged into a single SO, 'Semantic-based Knowledge and Content Systems,' based on the consultation outcomes.

#### 4. European Perspective

Semantic-based systems are crucial for knowledge-intensive sectors, including manufacturing, engineering, pharmaceuticals, financial sectors, media, and telecoms, as well as eGovernment and eHealth. EU-funded research aims to leverage Europe’s skills and knowledge resources to develop competitive, knowledge-based services suited to the multicultural and multilingual European markets.

- **Collaborative Efforts:** Promoting a critical mass of interdisciplinary research to avoid over-fragmentation and create new alliances in advanced Web services and semantic-based infrastructures. Participation from industrial stakeholders, including technology providers, ICT suppliers, and leading-edge users, is vital.

#### 5. Research Aims and Focus for 2005-2006

The Semantic-based Knowledge and Content Systems SO focuses on the intersection of WWW, Multimedia, Semantic Web, and Web Services domains, aiming to develop semantic-based and context-aware systems for acquiring, organizing, sharing, and using embedded knowledge in web and multimedia content.

- **Overall Objective:** Maximize automation of the knowledge lifecycle and achieve semantic interoperability between heterogeneous information resources and services across content types and natural languages. This will dramatically improve access, sharing, and use of information by humans and machines.
- **Intelligent Content:** Pioneering self-describing, adaptive, and seamless interaction with physical and digital surroundings. Addressing challenges related to the convergence of content and knowledge with metadata-based systems for all-digital content creation and management.

#### 5.1 Approach

The SO is centered around medium- to long-term research with short-term by-products, emphasizing enabling technologies, middleware, and application platforms. Foundational research targets formal theories, models, and languages for networked knowledge representation and reasoning, context modeling, and the intelligent content paradigm.

- **Strategy:** Undertake foundational and component-level research, and test and prove technology and components in representative demonstrators and test-beds. Emphasis is on hiding complexity and developing intuitive information interfaces. Large-scale, 3-4 year efforts must demonstrate the effective deployment of semantic technologies in support of demanding users, using realistic, large-volume data sets from information-bound sectors.

#### 5.2 Research Themes

The research focus is on three main themes:

- **Knowledge Acquisition and Modeling:** Capturing knowledge from raw information and multimedia content in webs and distributed repositories, adding semantics to turn poorly structured information into machine-processable knowledge. Foundational research addresses formal models and languages, semi-automatic ontology creation, and cross-lingual approaches. Component-level research includes automated knowledge discovery, metadata extraction, and cross-media and cross-lingual retrieval.
- **Knowledge Sharing and Use:** Combining semantically enriched information with context to provide actionable meaning, applying inferencing and reasoning for decision support and collaborative use of trusted knowledge between organizations. Foundational research addresses the semantics of evolving processes and computational models for context. Component- and system-level research integrates existing and emerging technologies to create scalable platforms for managing, searching, and sharing complex knowledge spaces.
- **Exploring and Bringing to Maturity the Intelligent Content Vision:** Developing self-describing, adaptive, and seamlessly interacting content. This theme emphasizes integrative scenarios and large-scale experimentation to demonstrate technical and organizational feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and replicability.

By focusing on these themes, the research aims to deliver robust, scalable solutions portable across key application domains in industry, trade, science, and society.
