# Watermark Duplication and Removal Rates

## Figure 12: Watermark Duplication Rate with M and K
- **Y-Axis:** Watermark duplication rate (0.5 to 0.85)
- **X-Axis:** 
  - **M Values:** 4, 6, 8
  - **K Values:** 2, 4, 6, 8

**Description:**
The figure illustrates how the watermark duplication rate changes with different values of \( M \) and \( K \). As \( M \) and \( K \) increase, the duplication rate initially increases but then drops significantly when the number of first packets increases rapidly.

## Figure 13: Watermark Removal Rate (M = 8)
- **Y-Axis:** Watermark removal rate (0.5 to 0.85)
- **X-Axis:** 
  - **S Values:** 400, 600, 800
  - **K Values:** 2, 4, 6, 8

**Description:**
This figure shows the effectiveness of the watermark removal algorithm when \( M = 8 \). The removal rate remains high even when duplication is not successful, indicating that the watermark can still be effectively removed.

## Figure 14: Packets Processed by SPRT Algorithm
- **Y-Axis:** Average number of packets processed (0 to 80)
- **X-Axis:** 
  - **M Values:** 4, 6, 8
  - **K Values:** 2, 4, 6, 8

**Description:**
The figure compares the average number of packets processed before the SPRT algorithm terminates. For certain values of \( M \) and \( K \), the modified SPRT processes more packets to detect the watermark existence, especially in cases where the original SPRT fails.

## 6.6. Detecting Watermark Existence

### Experiment Setup
- **Watermark Parameters:** Same as in previous subsections.
- **θ Value:** Depends on \( K \) and whether embedding packets are reused.
  - If packets are reused: \( \theta \approx \frac{1}{2K} \)
  - Otherwise: \( \theta \approx \frac{1}{K} \)

### SPRT Algorithm
- **Original SPRT:** Terminates when it accepts \( \theta = \theta_0 \).
- **Modified SPRT:** Restarts each time \( \theta = \theta_0 \) is accepted.
- **Parameters:**
  - \( \theta_0 = 0.02 \)
  - \( \theta_1 = 0.1 \)
  - \( S = 1000 \) ms
  - \( \alpha = \beta = 0.05 \)

### Results
- **Table 8:** Detection rates for both the original and modified SPRT.
  - For the original SPRT, the detection rate drops to 0 for 4 values of \( M \) and \( K \) due to many non-embedded packets at the beginning of the flow.
  - The modified SPRT detects the watermark in all cases.

- **Figure 14:** Compares the average number of packets processed before termination.
  - For the 4 values of \( M \) and \( K \) where the original SPRT's detection rate is 0, the modified SPRT processes more packets to detect the watermark.

## 8. Conclusion

Timing-based active watermarking schemes are effective for tracing back through stepping stones or anonymizing networks. However, these schemes are also vulnerable to attacks. This paper analyzes the secrecy of a specific watermarking scheme, showing that attackers can estimate the watermark parameter \( S \) using the (G)EM algorithm. We developed methods for watermark recovery and duplication and proposed using the SPRT algorithm for quick detection. Experiments demonstrated that our attack scheme can efficiently identify watermarks, and when parameters are not carefully selected, the entire watermark can be recovered or duplicated. The watermark removal algorithm also poses a significant threat to the watermark scheme.

Future work will investigate the secrecy of other watermark approaches, such as [27, 29].
