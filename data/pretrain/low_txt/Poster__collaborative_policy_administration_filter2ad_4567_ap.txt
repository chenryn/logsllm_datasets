### International Schedule for Delivery and Reflections on the DESIS Thematic Cluster Project

**1. Dewey, J. (1927). The Public and its Problems. New York: Holt.**

For the initial delivery of this DESIS thematic cluster project, we did not allocate time to set specific goals with stakeholders beyond the aims of the Green Camden initiative. We also did not establish a clear definition of success from the perspectives of all involved actors. This lack of clearly defined project goals—beyond the students' need to meet course requirements within a set timeframe—led to a sense of deflation once the projects concluded. Consequently, the projects became more focused on the students' learning objectives rather than the community's goals, as the students had to complete tasks within a specific timeframe to achieve their required course outcomes. This was disappointing in terms of community expectations.

Our usual approach to delivering collaborative design projects with non-design actors involves fostering ongoing partnerships and establishing open evaluation and feedback mechanisms. We believe that such an approach, where there is greater familiarity between collaborating partners, would have enabled communities to direct student research more effectively. Our experience showed that when students engaged meaningfully with the community, the most promising projects developed, though the lack of evaluative feedback means we cannot be certain of this, as no agreed measurement protocols were established.

### Key Learnings and Challenges

#### 1. Expertise
It is essential to clarify what "necessary community expertise" means in the context of a collaborative design project and to determine whether this expertise is available within the community. While community members are often experts in their own experiences, specialist knowledge is sometimes needed at the scoping stage. For example, in the Lissenden Garden project, activism is now occurring to take ideas forward. This expertise can be included and interrogated by, with, and for the community without predetermining subsequent project directions. Some of our designers, being undergraduates, found it challenging to engage as specialists, and not all were able to deliver the required social interaction. For some, the project clarified that community engagement is not their preferred future path, while others embraced collaborative design for social innovation.

#### 2. Access to Ideas and Concepts
Terms like "stakeholder," "duty holder," "mapping," "assets," "resources," and "social innovation" were inaccessible to non-design actors unfamiliar with service design methodologies. One group (MA Applied Imagination) developed a toolkit called "The Magic Beans" to help diverse actors envision new ways of doing things and think through who is involved, in what ways, and what actions and assets are required. This approach was a positive outcome and provides a resource that could be used in future projects.

#### 3. Funding
No funding was in place, which put pressure on time and staffing allocations and limited the design courses we could work with at CSM.

#### 4. Positive Outcomes
The students and community reframed goals to accommodate student learning requirements, which was generous. However, we felt that the students may have benefited more than the community, as community members wanted to continue to "harvest" more benefits from the work but could not due to project deadlines and the lack of funding for implementation. A resident pointed out that the project fell short because of the lack of implementation and realization. Another resident noted that a practical solution, such as the rainwater car wash, could be implemented with minimal cost, yet it did not happen. The involvement of Camden Council may have created passivity regarding implementation, given their role as duty-holders. Despite the austerity conditions, the community hoped that the council would take the co-developed concepts forward. The most positive outcome was that members of Green Camden who participated in the DESIS project went on to further exchange ideas, particularly in the context of water harvesting and the Lissenden Gardens project, where activism is now occurring.

### Implications for Design Practice, Education, and Policy

#### Design Practice
1. **Project as Prototype**: The 'Green Camden' project should be viewed as a prototype for holistic and equitable co-design. Establishing commonality among actors regarding the process and potentiality of design for social innovation is crucial. This project constitutes a single iteration in a 'slow prototyping' approach, building new capacities necessary for future collaboration.
2. **Effectuation as a Response to Situated Practice**: The project responded to challenges using principles of effectuation, drawing from entrepreneurial practices. While effectuation creates opportunities for innovation, it does not necessarily foster a climate for community collaboration, suggesting the need for a 'slow effectuation' approach.
3. **Forms of Facilitation**: The role of the designer as a facilitator manifested in two forms: facilitating the co-design process and facilitating social innovation. Tools like 'The Magic Beans' and products designed by students facilitated both processes.

#### Design Education
1. **DESIS Takes Time and Resources**: Engaging with resident communities in co-design requires significant time and resources. The 'Green Camden' project demonstrated the need for 'infrastructuring' for effective communication and collaboration.
2. **Learning Environments Beyond the Lab and HE**: Both designers and non-designers need to learn how to collaborate effectively. The project raises questions about teaching design for social innovation to non-designers and contextual understanding to designers.
3. **Not All Designers Are Co-Designers**: DESIS projects offer valuable experiences for students, helping them understand design as a situated social practice. Not all designers enjoy or are suited to collaborative work.

#### Design Policy
The project started new community conversations and opened up opportunities, demonstrating to Camden Council that design can identify necessary policies and facilitate desirable change. Camden Council has asked design educators to train staff for the Camden Social Innovation Fund, recognizing the value of co-design in policy development and delivery.

**Background**
In contemporary society, social innovation is spreading, and its potential as a driver of sustainable change is increasing. The design community, especially design schools, can play a pivotal role in facilitating this process. Social innovation can be seen as a process of change emerging from the creative re-combination of existing assets.
