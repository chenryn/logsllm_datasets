### Proof

We aim to bound the power probability from below. Specifically, we will show that the probability of an actual requester issuing fewer than \(\varrho\) requests decreases exponentially. To achieve this, we utilize a well-known Chernoff bound [64].

The probability is given by:
\[ \Pr[X \leq \varrho] \]

For \(0 < \varrho < \mu\) and \(\delta > 0\), we use the Chernoff bound:
\[ \Pr[X \leq (1 - \delta) \mu] \leq e^{-\frac{\delta^2 \mu}{2}} \]

We need to show that:
\[ \Pr[A \geq (1 + \delta) \mu] \leq \left( \frac{e^\delta}{(1 + \delta)^{1+\delta}} \right)^\mu \leq e^{-\frac{1}{3} \delta \mu} \]

To establish this, we start with the inequality:
\[ \ln \left( \frac{e^\delta}{(1 + \delta)^{1+\delta}} \right) \leq -\frac{1}{3} \delta \]

This simplifies to:
\[ \delta - (1 + \delta) \ln(1 + \delta) \leq -\frac{1}{3} \delta \]

Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ (1 + \delta) \ln(1 + \delta) - \delta \geq \frac{1}{3} \delta \]

Let \( f(x) = (1 + x) \ln(1 + x) - x \). We need to show that \( f(x) \geq \frac{1}{3} x \) for all \( x \geq 0 \).

The derivative of \( f(x) \) is:
\[ f'(x) = \ln(1 + x) \]

Since \( \ln(1 + x) \geq \ln(2) \) for all \( x \geq 1 \), and \(\ln(2) > \frac{1}{3}\), it follows that:
\[ f'(x) \geq \frac{1}{3} \]

Thus, \( f(x) \geq \frac{1}{3} x \) for all \( x \geq 0 \), which confirms our claim.

Therefore, the probability of an actual requester issuing fewer than \(\varrho\) requests falls exponentially, as required.

\(\blacksquare\)
