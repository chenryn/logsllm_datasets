### Eddie's Scheme

- **2003**: Eddie secured a job as an RNG (Random Number Generator) developer at MUSL (Multi-State Lottery Association).
- **While Working There**: He wrote code that made the numbers predictable on specific dates.
- **Certification**: The source code and RNG binaries were certified by a major testing lab.

### SeNet's Involvement

- **2016**: SeNet was contracted to perform imaging of one of the rigged lottery RNGs.
- **After Conviction**: SeNet was given permission to review the RNG images.
- **Initial Assumptions**: Eddie did not seem capable of writing a rootkit to change lottery numbers in memory. It was assumed he simply slipped some code into the RNG to rig it.
- **Binary Analysis**: At this point, only the binaries (no source code) were available for analysis.

### Reverse Engineering

- **RNG Components**:
  - **QV.EXE**: Executable containing the front-end material.
  - **QVRNG.DLL**: DLL containing the Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG).
  - **AWRAND.DLL**: DLL interfacing with the hardware RNG.
- **Initial Focus**: QVRNG.DLL was the first choice for investigation.
- **Suspicious Function**: A function with date checks and PRNG internals caught attention. This function was located at the end of the binary, suggesting it might have been added later.

### Logic Bomb

- **Dates of Illicit Wins**: All alleged illicit lottery wins were on two different days: November 23rd and December 29th (November 22nd and December 28th on leap years).
- **Source Code vs. Binary**: The source code had 25 functions, while the binary had 26 functions.
- **Additional Date**: The function included an additional date: May 27th (May 26th on leap years).
- **Conditions for Rigging**: The RNG was only rigged on Wednesdays and Saturdays.
- **Re-seeding Method**: Eddie reseeded the RNG with predictable numbers using various game parameters and the computer name. The reseeding process involved complex calculations to ensure predictability.

### Why Certification Failed

- **Certification Process**: The RNG was certified by a major testing lab, which ran statistical tests to ensure unbiased results.
- **Statistical Unbiasedness**: The output of the rigged RNG passed these statistical tests.
- **Source Code Audit**: The lab performed an audit of the source code but did not detect the tampering.

### Improvements for Future Rigging

- **Limited Dates**: Rigging the lottery on only three dates made it easier to identify illegal winnings.
- **Variable Dependence**: Making numbers dependent on variables like the computer name and time of day required buying multiple tickets for each drawing.
- **Discreetness**: The method of rigging the RNG could have been more discreet.

### Preventive Measures

- **In-Depth Reviews**: RNG source code should undergo thorough third-party reviews.
- **Binary Verification**: Binaries (including updates) should be compiled and checked against the vendor-provided binaries (e.g., using Bindiff).
- **Machine Imaging**: The machine itself should be imaged and configured either by a third party or in a supervised manner.

### Russian Slot Machine Hacking

- **Background**: In 2009, Russia made most gambling illegal, leading to the sale of slot machines to various buyers.
- **Suspicious Activity**: By 2011, casinos in Europe noticed unusual payouts. In June 2014, a casino in Missouri reported suspicious activity, leading to arrests in December 2014 and 2016 in Singapore.
- **Exploitation**: The slot machine software was reverse-engineered, revealing a weakness in the PRNG. Hackers used phones to record spins and calculated the pattern, transmitting timing marks to a custom app to trigger vibrations 0.25 seconds before the spin button should be pressed.

### Protecting Casinos and Operators

- **Understanding Security**: Compliance does not equate to security. More budget needs to be allocated to information security.
- **Vendor Scrutiny**: Operators should question game manufacturers about their security controls.

### Current Gaming Regulations

- **Maryland Gaming Commission**: Requires an annual IT Security Assessment by an independent and approved third party.
- **New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement**: Mandates an annual security assessment for iGaming platforms, including auditing and password complexity.
- **Tribal Minimum Internal Controls (MICs)**: Typically high-level and vary.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Standards such as PCI are often left to operators to determine the level of security implementation.

### Conclusion

- **Improvement Needed**: While regulated iGaming has added controls, there is still room for improvement from both operators and regulators.
- **Major Risk**: A significant risk exists in the code and SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) processes, which are not thoroughly examined by regulators.
- **Collaboration**: As gaming becomes more widely accepted, it is crucial for operators and regulators to work together to protect the integrity of the games.
