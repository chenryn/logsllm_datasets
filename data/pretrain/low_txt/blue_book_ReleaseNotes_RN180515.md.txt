## 180515 (AzSK v.3.2.*)

### Feature Updates

#### ARM Template Checker
- **Exemption and Exclusion Capabilities:** The ARM Template Checker now allows users to exempt specific checks from scans and exclude certain files within a scan folder. This fine-grained control is particularly useful for teams integrating the tool into CICD pipelines.

#### AzSK PS Session Reset
- **Session State Reset:** A new feature, `Clear-AzSKSessionState` (or its alias, `css`), has been introduced to reset the AzSK session state. This reduces the need to close and reopen PowerShell console sessions in many common scenarios, saving time and effort.
  
#### Security Verification Tests (SVTs)
- **Preview Controls:** New preview controls are now available for Bot Service and Container Instances, enhancing the security verification capabilities of these services.

#### Org-Policy Feature Updates (Non-CSE)
- **Custom Dashboard:** Non-CSE customers can now view AzSK health across their organization through a custom dashboard created during org-policy setup and deployed to the policy host subscription.
- **Release Control:** Org-policy owners can now manage when users across the organization will start using a new release of the DevOps Kit. This setting is included in the `AzSK.Pre.json` file in the 'policies' container. Note: Org-policy owners must update this setting explicitly with each new DevOps Kit release.
- **Enhanced Diagnostics:** The CA runbook and associated scripts have been extensively commented and instrumented to facilitate quicker diagnosis in various scan setup scenarios, such as central mode and multi-CA setups.
- **Rapid Testing:** The AzSK PS Session Reset feature can be used to quickly test org-policy changes without the need to restart PowerShell each time.

### Other Improvements and Bug Fixes

#### SVTs
- **Performance Optimization:** Following up on performance work from the last sprint, we have optimized calls to Event Hub and Webhook by batching multiple calls.
- **Attestation Fix:** An issue causing indexing conflicts when reading attestation data has been resolved.

#### Controls
- **Encryption Controls Removal:** Encryption controls for Storage Files & Queues have been removed, as they are now enabled by default in the product.
- **ASC Configuration Check Fix:** Several issues related to the ASC configuration check control have been fixed.

#### CA
- **Diagnostic Information Enhancement:** The CA runbook and supporting scripts that run during a CA scan have been enhanced to emit more diagnostic information, speeding up the diagnosis of CA scan issues.
- **SPN Deletion Fix:** An issue where the 'rollback code' was deleting a user-provided SPN upon an error during CA setup has been fixed. Now, SPNs are not deleted if they were explicitly passed to the CA commands.

#### CICD
- **Default Folder Path Fix:** An issue related to the default folder path when using the ARM Checker in CICD has been resolved.
