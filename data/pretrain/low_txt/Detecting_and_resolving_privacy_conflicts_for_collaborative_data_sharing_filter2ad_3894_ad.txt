### Rarely the Same as Either of the Other Two Solutions
Our solution consistently demonstrates a unique approach, distinct from the other two solutions. This further indicates that our method effectively balances privacy protection and data sharing, providing a robust solution for resolving privacy conflicts.

### 4.2.2 Evaluation of System Usability

#### Participants and Procedure
Retinue is a functional proof-of-concept implementation designed for collaborative privacy management. To assess its practicality and usability, we conducted a survey study with 30 participants. The goal was to explore users' preferences and perspectives on privacy controls, particularly in comparison to Facebook's existing system. We were especially interested in users' views on the current Facebook privacy system and their desire for more control over photos they do not own.

Participants were recruited through university mailing lists and Facebook itself, using Facebook’s built-in sharing API. While this recruitment method is not random, it leverages the natural dissemination features of Facebook, providing a representative sample of the user ecosystem.

In the user study (available at [http://bit.ly/retinue_study](http://bit.ly/retinue_study)), participants first answered questions about their usage and perception of Facebook’s privacy controls. They were then instructed to install the Retinue application using their Facebook profiles and complete the following tasks:
- Set privacy settings for a photo they do not own.
- Set privacy settings for a photo they own.
- Answer questions about their understanding of the process.

As users completed these tasks, they provided feedback on the usability of Retinue's controls.

#### User Study of Retinue
The usability evaluation criteria were divided into three main areas: likeability, understanding, and control.

- **Likeability**: Measures the user's general opinion of a particular feature or control. While it does not provide specific feedback for improvement, it helps identify important aspects of sharing and control.
- **Understanding**: Assesses how intuitive the concepts and controls are. This is crucial for enhancing the usability of the system.
- **Control**: Evaluates the user’s perceived control over their personal data. This can be further broken down into sharing with trusted users and protecting from untrusted users. Although this is not a definitive measure of privacy, making users feel safe is almost as important as actual protection.

Questions were rated on a three- or four-point scale, normalized to a 0 to 1 range for numerical analysis. Higher numbers indicate a positive opinion, while lower numbers indicate a negative one. We analyzed the 95% confidence interval for the users’ answers, assuming the population distribution to be mostly normal.

**Before Using Retinue:**
Participants were asked about their usage of Facebook to determine their perceived usability of the current Facebook privacy controls. Questions covered likeability, understanding, and control. For example:
- "Indicate how much you like privacy features for photos you are tagged in."
- "Indicate how much you understand how to prevent certain people from seeing photos I am tagged in."
- "Indicate how in control you feel when sharing photos I own with people I want to."

For the confidence interval, we focused on the upper bound to determine the maximum positive opinion of Facebook’s privacy controls.

**Results:**
- Likeability: 44%
- Sharing Control: 40%
- Protection Control: 35%
- Understanding: 36%

These results indicate an overall negative opinion of Facebook’s privacy controls.

**After Using Retinue:**
Participants were asked to perform tasks in Retinue and answer questions about their perceived usability. Questions included:
- "Indicate how much you like the trust level feature."
- "Indicate your understanding of the meaning of sharing loss."
- "Please indicate how in control you feel when sharing photos I own with the people I want to."

For the confidence interval, we focused on the lower bound to determine the minimum positive opinion of Retinue’s privacy controls.

**Results:**
- Likeability: 72%
- Understanding: 65%
- Sharing Control: 66%
- Protection Control: 70%

These results demonstrate a generally positive opinion of Retinue’s controls and features.

### 5. Related Work
Several proposals for access control schemes in Online Social Networks (OSNs) have been introduced. For example, Carminati et al. [9] proposed a trust-based access control mechanism, allowing the specification of access rules based on relationship type, depth, and trust level. Fong et al. [13] formalized and generalized the access control mechanism in Facebook, while Gates [11] discussed relationship-based access control as a new security paradigm. However, these works do not fully address the need for collaborative data sharing in OSNs.

Recent studies [7, 15, 18, 22, 24] have recognized the importance of joint management for data sharing, especially for photos. Squicciarini et al. [22] proposed a solution for collective privacy management in photo sharing, but it has usability issues due to the complexity of the Clarke-Tax mechanism. In contrast, our work introduces a simple yet flexible mechanism for collaborative management of shared data, including an effective conflict resolution solution that balances privacy and sharing.

Measuring privacy risk in OSNs has also been addressed by several works. Becker et al. [6] presented PrivAware, a tool to detect and report unintended information loss. Talukder et al. [23] introduced Privometer, which measures the risk of privacy leakage caused by malicious applications. Liu et al. [20] proposed a framework to compute the privacy score of a user. Our approach, however, measures privacy risk from multiple users, covering profile, friendship, and content sharing in OSNs.

### 6. Conclusion
In this paper, we propose a novel solution for detecting and resolving privacy conflicts in collaborative data sharing in OSNs. Our conflict resolution mechanism considers the tradeoff between privacy and sharing by quantifying privacy risk and sharing loss. We also describe a proof-of-concept implementation called Retinue, along with extensive evaluations. Future work will focus on developing a comprehensive access control model for collaborative authorization in OSNs and addressing security and privacy challenges in emerging information sharing services.
