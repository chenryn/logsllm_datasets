## Disclaimers
- These views are my own and do not represent those of my employer, publisher, or cat.
- I support open data but advocate for its proper implementation.
- Some vulnerabilities discussed have been fixed, modified, or changed, but they serve as cautionary tales.
- More results will be published in a forthcoming book from OR Books and on my blog.

## The Six Ws of Open Data
- **What is Open Data?**
- **Who has Open Data?**
- **Why is Open Data important?**
- **Where is Open Data available?**
- **When is Open Data released?**
- **Worrisome aspects of Open Data**

### What is the Open Data Movement?
The Open Data Movement is an initiative by many governments to make their data openly available. This is driven by:
- Calls for transparency ("It's the taxpayers' money")
- A sincere desire for innovation ("They'll come up with some great uses for our data at that Hackathon")
- Fear ("Wikileaks is going to get this anyway; it looks better if we release it")
- Cost savings ("We don't have to pay the developers")
- Positive sentiments about open source, transparency, and the idea that "data wants to be free"

### Notable Examples
- **NYC Datamine**: Released 103 municipal data sets on October 6, 2009.
- **Philadelphia OpenDataPhilly**: Provides access to various city data.
- **Open Data Framework (Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, and Ottawa)**: City-specific open data initiatives.
- **Open Data Challenge (EU)**: European Union's open data competition.
- **Direct input systems like seeclickfix.com**: Platforms for reporting and addressing local issues.

### NYC Datamine
On October 6, 2009, New York City released 103 municipal data sets. One dataset listed 1100 women's organizations, including private email addresses and secret questions/answers. This highlights the problem of neglecting to read and redact data before release.

### Toronto’s 311 Customer Requests System
- 25% of requests are about garbage/recycling pickup.
- Some requests are serious and personal.
- Location is supposed to be reported as partial postal codes, but sometimes full addresses are given.
- Combined with tools like Google Maps, these slip-ups can reveal sensitive information.

### See. Click. Fix. Shame.
- **Problem #3: Malice and Aforethought**: Offering a 20,000 € prize led to 434 entries from 24 member states.
- **Source**: [www.fair-play.sk]

### Fair-Play Alliance
- **Technical Aside**: The system runs off multiple open databases maintained by the Slovak government.
- **Access**: The Fair-Play Alliance has read-only access.
- **Issue**: How can they "take down specific data" they don’t control?
- **Status**: The alliance has appealed the ruling and is still in operation.

### Problem #4: Laws, Policies, and Judges Lag Behind Technology
- **Election Results as Open Data**: Should election results be open data? Can they reveal who voted for whom?
- **Problem #5: Inference from Small Numbers**: Philadelphia’s OpenDataPhilly.org includes campaign finance records, which are generally required to be disclosed. However, the full home address is provided, which can be used for disambiguation but may not be necessary.

### Campaign Finance Disclosure
- **Rules Date Back to 1970s**: US Federal Elections Commission files go back to 1980.
- **Interesting Addresses**: Some contributors list the same address, such as the office of the I.B.E.W. Electricians Union.
- **Conclusion**: Having a home address doesn’t significantly help in resolving possible duplicates.

### Underestimating the Desire and Ability to Exploit Data
- **Problem #6**: Underestimating the desire and ability of someone to exploit the database for information.
- **Problem #7**: Inconsistent data, where some people use non-home addresses.
- **Problem #8**: The need to re-examine the reasons for requiring certain data in light of new technologies and tools.

### Data Jigsawing
- **Problem #9**: Combining public and private databases to reveal more information.
- **Example**: Clive Beddoe, then-CEO of WestJet Airlines, and the City of Calgary Property Tax Assessment Site in 2007.

### Facial Recognition
- **Problem #10**: Your face is your newest privacy risk as facial recognition technology becomes mainstream.

### Data Journalism
- **Pistol Permits**: An FOI request by The Journal News, lohud.com, raised the question of whether the rich should have less privacy.
- **Indirect Risks of Government Disclosure**: Once data is released, it cannot be taken back. Companies like ChoicePoint Systems (now part of Lexis/Nexis) are storing this data.

### Genetic Information
- **Problem #11**: Information about DNA is becoming more accessible, e.g., from 23andme.com.

### Beware of Time-Traveling Robots from the Future
- **Tools**: An inquiring mind, a motive, scripting languages, ScraperWiki, SQL Lite, and hackathons.
- **Problem #12**: Data collected now and in the past can be analyzed, cross-referenced, etc., in the future.

### The Dirty Dozen (and Growing)
- **Inadvertent Disclosure**
- **Sloppy Data Entry**
- **Malicious Misinformation**
- **Law/Policy Lag**
- **Inference from Small Numbers**
- **Assuming Nobody Will Exploit Data**
- **Inconsistent Data**
- **Ignoring New Tools Like Mapping and Visualization**
- **Data Jigsawing**
- **Facial Recognition**
- **Powerful Data Like Genetic Info in Hands of Consumers**
- **Retroactive Analysis with Better Tools and Databases**

### Recommendations
- **Scan Files Carefully**: For direct PII that may be included.
- **Consider Indirect PII**: Ways in which PII may be revealed indirectly.
- **Act Promptly**: To remove databases that reveal PII and retain clear legal rights to do so.
- **Anticipate Cross-Correlation**: Of government data with other databases, public and private.
- **Provide Mechanisms**: For users to express privacy concerns and follow up.
- **Sponsor Hackathons**: Before data release to foresee unanticipated uses.
- **Negotiate Strong Privacy Protection**: On data provided to the private sector.
