# Standard Protocols

## Overview
- Creating a file-sharing application is a scientific endeavor.
- Designing a message protocol, on the other hand, is an art and requires a high level of expertise.
- **Benefits:**
  - **Interoperability:** Ensures seamless communication between different systems.
  - **Undetectability:** Our protocol is designed to be invisible, making it difficult for unauthorized entities to detect.
  - **Design Complexity:** Crafting a robust and efficient protocol is challenging but essential.
  - **Transport Protocol as a Means to an End:** The primary focus is on the effective exchange of data.
- **The Solution:**
  - Utilize existing protocols and standards such as HTTP, XML, and JSON.
  - Adhering to these pre-existing transfer protocols is crucial for saving cyberspace.

## Distributed Endpoints

### Overview
- **Hybrid Model:** Combines the best features of centralized and decentralized models.
- **Transformational Network:** Aims to replace the traditional centralized model, which can be problematic due to:
  - **Monitoring and Logging:** Centralized servers often monitor and log activities.
  - **Single Point of Failure:** If the server goes down, the entire system can fail.
  - **Dependency on Others:** File sharing should not rely on third parties or corporations that may comply with data retention and copyright laws.
- **Saving Cyberspace:** Requires supporting a more flexible and distributed model for file sharing.

### Decentralized Model
- **Evil of Centralization:**
  - Creates a market for IP concealment services.
  - Increases the risk of incoming connections and personal identification through IP addresses.
  - Not suitable for low-power devices.
  - Promotes inequality in access and usage.
- **Device Agnostic:**
  - Supports a wide range of devices including workstations, servers, laptops, tablets, phones, and embedded systems.
  - Compatible with various operating systems such as Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, and iOS.

### Personal Network
- **Pervasive and Ubiquitous:**
  - Can be used by individuals, families, or millions of users.
  - Provides the world in the palm of your hand.
- **The Solution:**
  - Combines the best aspects of both centralized and decentralized models while avoiding their pitfalls.
  - No direct communication or fixed servers.
  - Based on advanced network routing technologies.
  - Ensures autonomy and segregation of duties, along with a division of authority.

## Believe in the Right to Share
- **Quotes:**
  - "If you want to achieve something, you build the basis for it." – Noam Chomsky
  - "The only way to keep a secret is to never have one." – Julian Assange

## The Missing Link
- **Dilemma:**
  - Do we really need another file-sharing app?
  - Current offerings do not fully meet the needs of casual Dropbox users who also use torrents.
  - Users want to share content with friends, family, and strangers, and access it from anywhere in the world with fine-grained control.
- **Current Offerings:**
  - Solutions may exist depending on specific needs.
  - If not, what compromises are users willing to make and what risks are they willing to assume?

## Demonsaw
- **Features:**
  - Free, no ads, anonymous, no logging, no registration, no data retention, and no loss of control.
  - Secure, no P2P, no centralized servers, and everything is encrypted.
  - Undetectable by companies, governments, and third parties.
- **Simplicity:**
  - Share, search, browse, and transfer files easily.
  - Use at home, work, or while traveling.
  - Scalable from sharing with yourself to sharing with hundreds of friends.
  - Multi-platform support for Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, iOS, and web.

## Architecture
- **Overview:**
  - A file-sharing system should be flexible and cater to individual needs.
  - **Design:**
    - Entity Component System (ECS) for faster, more flexible, and easier-to-extend architecture.
    - Separate messages and data to ensure security and privacy.
- **Encryption:**
  - Messages and data are always encrypted.
  - Leverages established encryption standards like Diffie-Hellman and AES.
- **Components:**
  - **Router:** Groups clients, controls program flow, and relays messages and data chunks.
  - **Proxy:** Interfaces with external content sources, handling acquisition and aggregation.

## Summary
- **The Path Forward:**
  - "Only a life lived for others is a life worthwhile." – Albert Einstein
  - "And one more thing." – Steve Jobs

## Changing the World
- **Self-Empowerment:**
  - We possess a tremendous amount of talent and enjoy using our skills to find vulnerabilities and expose weaknesses.
  - Create something new and beautiful that has the power to change the world.
- **Enacting Change:**
  - Demonsaw is a tool that allows us to deviate from the antiquated and insecure model of file-sharing.
  - It provides a new way to share content without fear of retribution.
  - It is hoped that Demonsaw will enact change in content distribution.
  - Go forth and share…
