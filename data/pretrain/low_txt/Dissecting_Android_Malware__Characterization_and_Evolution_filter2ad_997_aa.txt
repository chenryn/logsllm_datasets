**Abstract:**
The rapid adoption of smartphones, particularly on the Android platform, has spurred a significant increase in mobile malware. To effectively combat this threat, it is crucial to understand the characteristics and evolution of these malicious programs. However, our ability to defend against them is hampered by a limited understanding of their nature and the lack of timely access to samples.

In this paper, we focus on the Android platform and aim to systematically characterize existing Android malware. Over the course of more than a year, we have collected over 1,200 malware samples, covering the majority of known Android malware families from their first appearance in August 2010 to recent ones in October 2011. We provide a comprehensive characterization of these samples, examining their installation methods, activation mechanisms, and the nature of their malicious payloads.

Our analysis reveals that Android malware is rapidly evolving to evade detection by existing mobile antivirus solutions. An evaluation with four leading mobile security software products shows that the best case detects 79.6% of the samples, while the worst case detects only 20.2%. These findings highlight the urgent need for the development of next-generation anti-malware solutions.

## I. Introduction

In recent years, the proliferation of smartphones has been remarkable. According to CNN [1], smartphone shipments have tripled in the past three years, rising from 40 million to about 120 million. Unfortunately, this growth has also led to a surge in mobile malware. As the most popular mobile platform, Google's Android has become the primary target for malware. Reports indicate that over 46% of all mobile malware targets Android, and this figure is increasing [2]. Another report highlights a 400% increase in Android-based malware since summer 2010 [3].

Given the rapid spread of Android malware, there is an urgent need to develop effective mitigation strategies. However, without a deep understanding of these threats, it is challenging to create practical and effective defenses. Additionally, the research community lacks a comprehensive dataset of mobile malware to study and develop solutions.

This paper makes three key contributions:
1. **Dataset Collection:** We present the first large-scale collection of 1,260 Android malware samples, spanning 49 different malware families. This dataset, accumulated over more than a year, covers the majority of known Android malware from August 2010 to October 2011. The samples were collected through manual and automated crawling from various Android markets. To support further research, we will release the entire dataset at http://malgenomeproject.org/.
2. **Characterization and Analysis:** Based on the collected samples, we perform a timeline analysis and a detailed characterization of their behavior, including installation, activation, and payload types. Our findings show that 86.0% of the samples are repackaged versions of legitimate applications, highlighting the need for better policing of app stores. Recent malware families are adopting more sophisticated techniques such as update attacks and drive-by downloads. Additionally, 36.7% of the samples leverage root-level exploits, and over 90% turn compromised phones into botnets.
3. **Evolution and Detection:** We conduct an evolution-based study of representative Android malware, showing that they are rapidly evolving to evade detection. Our evaluation with four leading mobile antivirus solutions (AVG Antivirus Free, Lookout Security & Antivirus, Norton Mobile Security Lite, and Trend Micro Mobile Security Personal Edition) reveals that the best case detects 79.6% of the samples, while the worst case detects only 20.2%. This indicates a significant lag in the effectiveness of current anti-malware solutions.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II presents a timeline analysis of Android malware. Section III provides a detailed characterization of the samples. Section IV discusses the evolution of representative malware families. Section V evaluates the detection capabilities of four mobile antivirus solutions. Section VI discusses potential future improvements, followed by a survey of related work in Section VII. Finally, we summarize our findings in Section VIII.

## II. Malware Timeline

Table I lists the 49 Android malware families in our dataset, along with the month each family was first discovered. We compiled this list by thoroughly examining security announcements, threat reports, and blog posts from leading mobile antivirus companies and researchers [6]â€“[12]. We also actively requested malware samples and crawled from both official and alternative Android markets. As of this writing, our collection is believed to be the most comprehensive and up-to-date representation of Android malware.

Specifically, our dataset spans slightly more than one year, from the first Android malware, FakePlayer, in August 2010, to recent samples in October 2011. During this period, approximately 52 Android malware families were reported. Our dataset includes 1,260 samples across 49 families, providing a robust coverage of known Android malware.

For each malware family, Table I also indicates the number of samples in our collection and whether they were found in the official or alternative Android markets. To ensure the accuracy of our dataset, we verified the samples using existing mobile antivirus software. Any samples not detected by these tools were manually confirmed to be malware.
