### Table 4: Passive SCT Data
- **Note**: SNIs from Sydney are not available as only outbound packets were observed (see Section 4).
- **Stapled OCSP Responses**: Servers replied with stapled OCSP responses in 13.64% of these connections (248.1M).

### Data Collection at UCB
- Our data collection at UCB extended to ports other than 443.
- **Port 443**: 74,311 certificates (99.2%) with an embedded SCT were encountered on port 443.
- **Port 80**: 279 cases were observed in TLS connections on port 80.
- **SCTs over TLS and OCSP**: The situation is similar for SCTs over TLS and OCSP.
- **Precertificates**: We did not encounter any precertificates in active or passive data.

### 5.2 Properties of Certificates with SCTs
- A small number of CAs are responsible for the majority of issued certificates containing embedded SCTs:
  - **Symantec**: 67.16% (Geotrust: 33.67%, Symantec: 28.75%, Thawte: 4.74%)
    - **Reason**: Google requires Symantec to log all its certificates due to previous incidents of mis-issuance [65].
    - **Chrome Warning**: Chrome shows a warning for Symantec certificates without SCTs.
  - **Other CAs**:
    - GlobalSign: 11.91%
    - Comodo: 11.66%
    - StartCom: 3.19%
      - **Distrust**: StartCom and its parent company WoSign are already distrusted by Mozilla for new certificates [78] and have been distrusted by Google Chrome as planned in September 2017 [76].

- **Overall Observation**: Although we observe a substantial number of certificates containing SCTs, only a few CAs are responsible for this. Some CAs are required by Google to provide SCTs, indicating that currently not many CAs seem interested in providing embedded SCTs, showing that opinions did not significantly change since 2014 [13].

    - 3 Logs: 107.63k (12.4%)

### 5.3 Invalid SCTs
- **Validation**: We validate all SCTs, which nearly always succeeded, with a few notable exceptions.
- **Case Study**:
  - **Certificate Issued to www.fhi.no by Buypass**:
    - **Observation**: In both active and passive measurements, a correctly CA-signed certificate contained invalid embedded SCTs.
    - **Embedded SCTs**: From Google Aviator, Venafi, and Symantec logs.
    - **Resolution**: Buypass confirmed a corner case in their implementation caused the embedding of SCTs belonging to a different certificate for the same domain. They revoked the certificate and issued a new one with valid SCTs [19, 20].
- **TLS Extensions**:
  - **Invalid SCTs**: Primarily from TLS extensions, requiring manual configuration on the server side.
  - **Active Scan**: 121 domains serving 101 certificates, 91 of which were issued by Let's Encrypt (who do not embed SCTs in their certificates).
  - **Causes**: Erroneous SCTs can be caused by operators updating server certificates manually but forgetting to update the SCT configuration.
- **Symantec’s Deneb Log**:
  - **Special Log**: Truncates all domains to the second-level domain, excluding subdomains.
  - **Validation**: Requires modifying the received certificate and truncating all domains.
  - **Trust**: Not trusted by Google or, to our knowledge, anyone else.
  - **Usage**: 129 certificates logged in Deneb logs, 87 also included in Google logs, and 2 in a Comodo log, defeating the purpose of Symantec’s Deneb log. 64 certificates were issued for Amazon domains.

### 5.4 CT Inclusion Status
- **Inclusion Check**:
  - **Normal Certificates**: Straightforward to check.
  - **Precertificates**: Require reconstruction from the final end host certificate.
  - **Enhancements**: Enhanced a preexisting X.509 certificate parsing library for PostgreSQL to strip signatures, SCTs, and poison extensions.
  - **Conclusion**: All encountered certificates with a valid embedded SCT were correctly logged by the respective CT logs, indicating that CT’s precertificate system works almost flawlessly, with the one negligible exception of the www.fni.no certificate.

### 6 HSTS and HPKP
- **Active Scans**:
  - **Probing**: We probe servers for HSTS and HPKP headers by sending HTTP HEAD requests.
  - **Analysis**: Deployment, consistency, lifetime, and cryptographic validity of the received headers.
- **Table 7: Unique HTTP Code 200, HSTS, and HPKP Domains**
  - **Consistent HTTP 200**:
    - MUC IPv4: 26.8M (3.59%)
    - SYD IPv4: 26.5M (3.58%)
    - MUC IPv6: 1.2M (3.36%)
    - Total: 27.8M (3.60%)
  - **HSTS**:
    - MUC IPv4: 960.0k (3.59%)
    - SYD IPv4: 948.5k (3.58%)
    - MUC IPv6: 38.8k (3.36%)
    - Total: 1.0M (3.60%)
  - **HPKP**:
    - MUC IPv4: 5.9k (0.02%)
    - SYD IPv4: 5.8k (0.02%)
    - MUC IPv6: 1.0k (0.09%)
    - Total: 6.2k (0.02%)

### 6.1 Header Consistency
- **Intra-Scan Consistency**:
  - Investigated whether headers for a domain are consistent within each of the TUMv4, TUMv6, and SYDv4 measurements.
  - **Findings**: For each scan, we find... (continue with the specific findings).
