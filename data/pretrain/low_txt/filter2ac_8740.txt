**ATT&CK ID:** T1556  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Modify Authentication Process

Adversaries may alter authentication mechanisms and processes to gain unauthorized access to user credentials or to enable unwarranted access to accounts. The authentication process is managed by various components, such as the Local Security Authentication Server (LSASS) and the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) on Windows, pluggable authentication modules (PAM) on Unix-based systems, and authorization plugins on macOS. These components are responsible for collecting, storing, and validating user credentials.

By modifying an authentication process, an adversary can potentially authenticate to a service or system without the need for valid account credentials. This technique allows attackers to bypass normal authentication requirements, thereby gaining unauthorized access to resources.
