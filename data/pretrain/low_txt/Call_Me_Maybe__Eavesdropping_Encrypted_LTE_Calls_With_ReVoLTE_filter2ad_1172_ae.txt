### Security Flaws in LTE

Security issues in Long-Term Evolution (LTE) networks can arise from several sources, including specification flaws, implementation flaws, and configuration flaws. Specification flaws introduce vulnerabilities at the foundational level of LTE, while implementation flaws are examples of insecure realizations of the specifications. Kim et al. [29] introduced LTEFuzz, a tool designed to identify vulnerabilities in various LTE implementations. Additionally, configuration flaws can lead to security vulnerabilities when network parameters are set up insecurely by providers. Chlosta et al. [17] analyzed multiple network configurations and discovered flaws that allow an adversary to impersonate a victim to the network.

### LTE Cryptography

LTE (4G) encrypts radio transmissions using secure encryption algorithms such as AES. In contrast, the second-generation GSM standard specifies three encryption algorithms, two of which have been compromised. The A5/2 algorithm is intentionally weak and has been prohibited [12, 22, 33], while the A5/1 algorithm, although stronger, can still be broken using consumer hardware and rainbow tables [14, 20, 41]. In scenarios where VoLTE is not supported, GSM calls may still be used, and if A5/1 encryption is employed, the call can be eavesdropped.

### VoLTE Security

The security of VoLTE (Voice over LTE) has been analyzed by Kim et al. and Li et al. [28, 31]. They identified attacks that enable caller identity spoofing and billing bypass. Unlike our work, these studies focused on active client attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in the core network or IMS configuration to achieve identity spoofing or billing bypasses.

### Conclusion

Data confidentiality is a central security goal for LTE and a fundamental requirement for trust in our communication infrastructure. We introduced the REVOLTE attack, which exploits an implementation flaw in the LTE protocol to eavesdrop and recover encrypted VoLTE calls. Our attack builds upon a previously introduced keystream reuse and extends it with a sophisticated attack concept, enabling eavesdropping in real-world commercial networks. Through a series of preliminary experiments, we analyzed the different protocol and transmission characteristics of VoLTE and provided an in-depth evaluation of network configurations. Based on these insights, we conducted the REVOLTE attack in a commercial network with a setup costing less than $7,000. Our results highlight the need for both short-term solutions to prevent exploitation in current mobile generations and long-term solutions to ensure data confidentiality in upcoming generations, which currently exhibit similar vulnerabilities.
