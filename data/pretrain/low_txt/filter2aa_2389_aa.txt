We do not want to live in a police state. The increasing integration of technology into law enforcement raises important questions about privacy, control, and the potential for misuse.

### Key Points
1. **Networked Technologies and Automation:**
   - Networked technologies have the potential to automate the enforcement of laws.
   
2. **Risks of Automation:**
   - Reckless and pervasive automation can lead to disastrous and unintended consequences.
   
3. **Role of the Audience:**
   - This audience is in a unique position to defend society and appropriately confront automated law enforcement systems.

### Definition of Automated Law Enforcement
- **Definition:**
  - Any computer-based system that uses input from unattended sensors to algorithmically determine if a crime has been or is about to be committed, then takes responsive action, such as warning the subject or informing law enforcement.
  - These systems may also be capable of automatically imposing some form of punishment.

- **Conceptual Model:**
  - Our proposed conceptualization of automated law enforcement is based on a model that is subject to automation at various points.

### Precursors to Automated Law Enforcement
- **Increased Proliferation and Diversity of Sensors:**
  - Examples include:

- **Quote:**
  - "When I get into a car—a computer that I put my body into—with my hearing aid—a computer I put inside my body—I want to know that these technologies are not designed to keep secrets from me, or to prevent me from terminating processes on them that work against my interests." - Cory Doctorow: [Source](http://boingboing.net/2012/01/10/lockdown.html)

### Technological Advancements and Risks
