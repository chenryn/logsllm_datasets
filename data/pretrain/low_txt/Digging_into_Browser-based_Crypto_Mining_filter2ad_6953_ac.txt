## Mined Blocks Over Time from the Coinhive Network

- **Figure 5:** Illustrates the mined blocks over time from the Coinhive network. The black segments indicate outages in our infrastructure.

### Verification of Proof of Work (PoW) Input

To ensure that the PoW input was used to mine the block, we leverage the fact that each block contains a Coinbase transaction (the first leaf of the Merkle tree), which is used to pay block rewards to the miner (i.e., Coinhive). This uniquely identifies the origin, ensuring that we do not accidentally see a Merkle tree root from another miner in the PoW input.

### Investigation of PoW Inputs

We connected to one of Coinhive's mining pools and requested a new PoW input every 500 milliseconds. Since the network finds a new block on average every two minutes, we clustered the PoW inputs by the pointer to the previous (most recent at the time of reception) block. We observed that we never received more than 8 different PoW inputs, even though theoretically, more exist. Coinhive operates 32 mining endpoints, and when we connected to all of them, we observed up to 128 different PoW inputs per block. This suggests that there are two endpoints per backend system, allowing us to investigate each of the 128 PoW inputs and verify the Merkle tree root against the actual mined block's transactions.

### Measurements

We collected new PoW inputs for four weeks, enabling us to estimate a lower bound on the blocks mined through Coinhive. Figure 5 shows a blue block for every Coinhive-mined block and the total number of blocks on that day. The figure indicates that blocks are found throughout the day, suggesting a global reach. We noted multiple days with significantly more blocks, such as April 30, May 10, and May 22, 2018. These dates correspond to public holidays, which may explain the increased Internet usage and, consequently, more mined blocks.

- **Median (Average):** 8.5 (9.0) blocks per day.
- **Disruption:** On May 6 and May 7, 2018, Coinhive's service experienced disruptions, resulting in few or no announced PoW inputs.

### Estimation of Combined Hash Rate

The median difficulty during our observations was 55.4G hashes, translating to a network hash rate of 462M h/s. Coinhive mines approximately 8.5 blocks per day, contributing 1.18% of the 720 blocks/day, which translates to a hash rate of 5.5M h/s. Assuming a web client performs between 20 to 100 h/s, Coinhive requires between 292K and 58K constantly mining users.

- **Comparison with Coinhive's Report:** In September 2017, Coinhive reported a peak hash rate of 13.5M h/s (5% of the network’s hash rate). However, our results are long-term averages, making a direct comparison challenging.

### Revenue Analysis

Over the four-week observation period, Coinhive earned 1,271 XMR. Table 6 provides a three-month analysis, showing continuity. At the time of writing, one XMR is worth 120 USD, having peaked at 400 USD in early 2018. Assuming 120 USD per XMR, Coinhive mines Monero worth around 150,000 USD per month, with 70% going to their users. Despite operational costs, this model appears potentially profitable for Coinhive.

- **Takeaway:** Coinhive currently contributes ∼1.18% of the Monero network's mining power. While it may be profitable, the feasibility of browser-based mining as an alternative to ad-based financing remains questionable.

## Related Work

Browser-based mining has been extensively covered in media, including reports on Pirate Bay, hacked websites, and drive-by Monero mining on Android. Academic studies have also investigated browser-based mining, with [8] being the first to do so. Our work complements these findings by incorporating WebAssembly fingerprinting and providing deeper insights into Coinhive's operations.

## Conclusion

This paper analyzes the prevalence of browser-based mining, a new revenue-generating model for websites. By inspecting 137M .com/.net/.org and Alexa Top 1M domains, we found that the prevalence of browser mining is currently low at < 0.08% of the probed sites. We present a new technique based on WebAssembly fingerprinting to identify miners, detecting up to 82% of mining websites not identified by block lists. Coinhive, the largest web-based mining provider, mines 1.18% of all Monero blocks, with a combined median hash rate of 5.5M h/s. While Coinhive generates significant revenue, the stability of cryptocurrencies and the impact on website performance and user costs need further investigation.
