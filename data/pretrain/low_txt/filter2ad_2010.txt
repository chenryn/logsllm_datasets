## Abstract
The 19th Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society (WPES 2020) was held as a virtual conference on November 9, 2020, in conjunction with the 27th ACM Conference on Computer and Communication Security (CCS 2020). The primary objective of WPES is to convene privacy researchers and practitioners to discuss the privacy challenges that arise in an interconnected society and to explore potential solutions. The workshop program included 12 full papers and 3 short papers, selected from a total of 34 submissions. Topics covered in the program include, but are not limited to: communication privacy, data anonymization, differential privacy, medical privacy, mobile privacy, privacy engineering, privacy policies, user perception of privacy, and web privacy.

## 1. Introduction
The Information Revolution has profoundly transformed society. One of the most significant implications of this technological shift has been the massive increase in the collection, sharing, and analysis of personal data. The goal of this workshop is to address the privacy problems that have emerged and to discuss potential solutions. This is the 19th iteration of this annual forum, which is held in conjunction with the ACM CCS conference.

The workshop welcomes submissions from academia, government, and industry, presenting novel research on all theoretical and practical aspects of electronic privacy, as well as experimental studies of fielded systems and systematization of knowledge (SoK) submissions. We also encourage submissions from other communities, such as law and business, that offer their perspectives on technological issues. Topics of interest for WPES include, but are not limited to:

- Attacks on data privacy
- Location privacy
- Bias and fairness in machine learning
- Machine-learning privacy
- Biometrics privacy
- Medical privacy
- Blockchain and cryptocurrency privacy
- Mobile-device privacy
- Communication privacy
- Privacy and digital identity
- Data anonymization
- Private data analysis
- Data-protection schemes
- Privacy-enhancing technologies
- Data security
- Privacy policies
- Deanonymization
- Privacy threats
- Definitions of privacy
- Private data publishing
- Economics of privacy
- Social-network privacy
- Hardware side channels
