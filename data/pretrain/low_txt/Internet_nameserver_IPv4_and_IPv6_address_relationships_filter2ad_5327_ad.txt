### 3.6 DNS Machine Siblings

Finally, we note that the passively and actively collected DNS siblings may be, and often are, equipment siblings—i.e., a group of machines operating to service DNS requests. Similarly, a single IPv4 or IPv6 address may represent the outward-facing address for a larger group of machines behind that address. To better differentiate such cases, we seek to identify DNS machine siblings, i.e., IPv4 and IPv6 addresses that exist on the same physical machine, among the previously inferred equipment sibling equivalence classes.

We tie the passive and active DNS data collection with our TCP timestamp-based sibling inference mechanism by inducing remote resolvers to initiate TCP connections via truncation, as described in §2.3. While actively probing DNS resolvers, we capture all TCP packets. Our goal is to determine whether the equivalence classes obtained from active probing can be reduced to machine siblings.

To cull machine siblings, we determine the timestamp skew for each IP address within an active DNS equivalence class. We compare the skew of an IP address in question with all machine siblings of the existing equivalence class. An IP address is added to the machine sibling group with the smallest skew. If no existing group has a sufficiently small skew (q = 1.0), we create a new machine sibling group with a single IP address. This process continues until all IPs of the equipment equivalence class are clustered. We repeat this for all equipment equivalence classes.

For example, the largest equivalence class from active probing includes 172 IP addresses, 78 of which are IPv6. Of these 172 IPs, we identify six different machine sibling groups. The largest machine sibling group consists of 131 IPs, while the second-largest contains 6 IPs. 26 IPs have non-monotonic timestamps, and 1 IP did not negotiate timestamps.

We examine the relationship between the equipment siblings inferred by active DNS probing versus machine siblings. Figure 10 provides the cumulative fraction of DNS equivalence classes versus the number of machine equivalence classes in the equipment class. We observe that nearly 60% of the DNS equivalence classes are, in fact, machine siblings, i.e., all of the IPs within the equivalence class belong to the same machine as inferred by our timestamp method. Another 38% of the equivalence classes have at most two groups of equipment siblings. Fewer than 1% of the actively collected siblings correspond to three or more machine sibling groups.

Next, we examine the size of the machine sibling groups within the active DNS equipment equivalence classes. Figure 11 shows the cumulative fraction of DNS equivalence classes versus the ratio of the largest inferred machine sibling group to the size of the original equipment equivalence class. For example, in the aforementioned equivalence class, the ratio is 0.76 (131/172). We see that for approximately 50% of the equipment equivalence classes, the ratio is 1.0, indicating that the equivalence class is covered by a single machine sibling group. Approximately 45% have a ratio of 0.5, meaning that the largest machine sibling group accounts for half of the total IPs within the equipment equivalence class.

### 4 Discussion

In this section, we discuss additional details and implications of our methodology and results. In particular, we examine temporal effects, AS partitioning of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, and root causes for the large equivalence classes we observe.

#### 4.1 Temporal Effects

As address associations are collected over time, the equivalence classes change. For example, suppose the system reports association (v4′, v6′). If neither address is present in the existing equivalence classes, we create a new equivalence class containing just this pair. If only one of these addresses was observed previously, an existing equivalence class is increased. If both addresses are previously known and are in the same equivalence class, then possibly a new edge is added to the graph. Lastly, if both addresses are previously known but are in different equivalence classes, then the two prior equivalence classes are merged into one, with this new address pair forming the joining edge.

If an address pair remains in a 1-1 class over a period of time (six months for the passive dataset), we gain confidence that these candidate siblings are at least equipment-siblings. Equipment-siblings also likely pertain to the m-n equivalence classes that collapse to 1-1 when the addresses are aggregated (after) to prefixes—note the increase in percentage from 14% to 39% in Table 1.

Similarly, with the targeted fingerprinting technique, a common clock skew may imply machine-siblings, although with two physical interfaces on a single machine that are separately assigned IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. We hope to refine our notion of equipment and machine siblings as we gain more insight into such relationships.

#### 4.2 AS’s of DNS Address Pairs

In contrast to the fingerprinted address pairs of Alexa (§3.5), for which there is not an implied coupling, we might expect a stronger AS match between address pairs of the nameservers involving DNS resolution. However, of the resolver address pairs in the dataset (§3.2), excluding those whose IPv6 address is 6to4 or Teredo, 31% have addresses in distinct ASes, as opposed to 18% of the Alexa sites. If we also exclude those pairs whose IPv6 address is in AS 6939, an IPv6 tunnel broker [14], the percentage is still 25%. Manual checks on the more popular pairs with different ASes reveal companies using separate ASes for IPv4 and IPv6, or those likely having a business relationship, where possibly the network equipment is owned by one company, but one of the addresses is registered with the other. The caveats in §3.5 again apply.

#### 4.3 Large Equivalence Classes

Figure 12 is analogous to Figure 7, except that it analyzes the passive-DNS data set. Note the larger range on the x-axis compared with Figure 7. Figure 12 shows that although the aggregation to prefixes (after the computation of the equivalence classes), the dark-blue line, substantially reduces the size, still 20% of the prefixes are in equivalence classes of size 19 or more, and 10% in equivalence classes of size 64 or more. When we restrict the data to the final week and aggregate to prefixes, there is again a significant reduction, though it is unclear how much is due to simply less data and how much to the removal of old associations that are no longer active. When we aggregate the full data set to ASs, the equivalence classes become rather small, except, as was the case with the active-DNS measurement, for a single large one, which here is of size 412-200. Again, as before, the dominant ASs are 15169 and 6939.

A strong trend in our investigation is that with additional data collection, greater complexity appears. This is indicated in Figure 6, where repeated lookups by the same set of open resolvers reveal new nameserver addresses, and the resulting equivalence classes become larger as the number of lookups goes from 1 to 32. This is also indicated in Table 1 and Figure 12, where the set of prefixes seen in the final week is substantially less than over the six-months, and the equivalence classes are substantially smaller (though for this longer time span, some of the address pairings may no longer be active). The new nameservers that are seen are often, but not always, within the same /24 or /64 as those previously observed, as one would expect from a bank of load-balanced nameservers.

### 5 Conclusions

This paper examines the relationship between IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of Internet server infrastructure. Our primary contribution is a methodology for characterizing the inter-relation of IPv4 and IPv6 among Internet DNS and web servers. We deploy both active and passive measurement techniques to discover groups of equipment equivalence classes, and then tie the techniques together with physical TCP fingerprinting to discover more granular machine equivalence classes.

While prior work explores IPv6 client adoption and penetration, to our knowledge, this paper is the first to take a comprehensive look at the server-side where IPv6 deployment is active [10, 1]. Characterizing server IPv6 addresses and their relation to IPv4 is important for: i) tracking the evolution of IPv6; ii) understanding the potential for correlated failures and security risks when IPv4 and IPv6 services are physically co-located; and iii) preventing erroneous Internet measurements intended to compare the performance of IPv4 and IPv6 paths.

We develop and deploy three novel measurement systems: i) a passive DNS collection using a two-level DNS hierarchy that encodes IPv4 addresses within IPv6 nameserver records; ii) an active DNS probing system that induces a combination of IPv4 and IPv6 DNS resolver lookups in a single resolution operation and can also force resolvers to utilize TCP; and iii) an active TCP physical device fingerprinting technique that more precisely identifies IPv4 and IPv6 addresses present on the same machine.

We find significant complexity, as measured by large equivalence classes in both the active and passive data sets, between IPv4 and IPv6 associations. Much of this complexity is attributable to large DNS resolver clusters used by large providers. Further complicating "clean" association of addresses are instances where operators employ shared caches, load balancing, NAT, carrier-grade NAT, IPv6 address randomization, or mixtures thereof.

While we examine servers in-depth, the relationship between IPv4 and IPv6 router addresses is an important infrastructure component we plan to address in future work to better understand topological differences. The primary implication of our work is an under-appreciated fact: that the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of Internet servers frequently belong to different interfaces, machines, and even autonomous systems. We hope that our results illuminate not only some of the underlying complexity between IPv4 and IPv6 as deployed in the Internet today but also properties to protect critical infrastructure and methodologies for conducting sound IPv4/IPv6 comparison measurements.
