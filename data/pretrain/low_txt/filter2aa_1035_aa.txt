## Denial of Information (DoI) Attacks

### Definition
Denial of Information (DoI) attacks are intentional assaults designed to overwhelm or otherwise disrupt human decision-making processes by altering the availability or integrity of information.

### Example
A user script that generates fake credit card numbers and repeatedly submits them to phishing sites, thereby wasting the phisher's time. However, a more sophisticated attacker would likely filter out such submissions based on IP addresses.

### The Problem of Information Growth
- **Surface Web:** Approximately 170 TB (17 times the Library of Congress)
- **Instant Messaging (IM):** Generates about five billion messages daily (750 GB) or 274 TB annually.
- **Email:** Produces around 400,000 TB per year.
- **P2P File Exchange:** Rapidly growing, with video files larger than 100 MB being the largest and MP3 files being the most frequently exchanged.

### Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
The effectiveness of an IDS ultimately depends on a single judgment call: whether or not to take action based on detected anomalies.

## DoI Attack Scenarios

| Scenario | Signal (s) | Noise (n) | S/N Ratio | Impact |
|----------|------------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| #1       | Low        | Low       | Parity    | Marginal to good ability to find information |
| #2       | High       | Low       | Parity    | Good to excellent ability to find information |
| #3       | Low        | High      | Good      | DoI     |
| #4       | Very High  | Very High | Bad       | DoI, processing, I/O, or storage capability exceeded (aka DoS) |

## Legal and Regulatory Defenses

- **Lawsuits and Legal Actions:**
  - Microsoft, AOL, Earthlink, and Yahoo filed six antispam lawsuits in March 2004.
  - Federal CAN-SPAM Legislation (January 2004)
  - California Business and Professions Code (September 1998), which prohibits unsolicited commercial email.

- **Regulatory and Governmental Measures:**
  - New laws and regulations aimed at curbing DoI attacks.
  - Public relations campaigns to raise awareness.
  - Ethical and cultural initiatives to promote responsible behavior.

- **Organizational and Community Efforts:**
  - Formation of topical counter-DoI groups.
  - Increasing the financial cost of conducting DoI operations.
  - Technological defenses (see next section).

## System Model

### Components
- **Human Consumer and Producer:**
  - Communication Channel
  - Consumer Node (RAM, Hard Drive, CPU)
  - Producer Node (Short-Term Memory (STM), Long-Term Memory (LTM), Cognition)
  - Sensory Inputs (Vision, Hearing, Speech, Motor)

### Example DoI Attacks
- **Exploiting Rounding Algorithms:** Triggering multiple alerts.
- **Misleading Advertisements:** Spoofing browsers.

### Example DoI Defenses
- **TCP Damping:** Reducing the impact of DoI attacks.
- **Usable Security:** Implementing security measures that are easy for users to understand and use.

## Pull Example: Web Search

### Steps
1. Formulate Query
2. Scan 2 Pages of Results
3. Reformulate Query
4. Scan Top 2 Results

  - Generate HTML Result

## Information Firewall

### Components
- **Parser:** Analyzes data sources.
- **Filtering and Fusion Engine:** Combines and filters data.
- **Rules Engine:** Applies predefined rules.
- **Transform Processing Engine:** Transforms data for presentation.
- **Database:** Stores and retrieves data.

### Information Visualization
Information visualization uses interactive, sensory representations, typically visual, to enhance understanding of abstract data and support cognitive processes.
