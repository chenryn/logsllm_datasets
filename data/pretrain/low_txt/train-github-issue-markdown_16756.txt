## Steps to Reproduce
1. Connect your iPhone to your computer via USB.
2. Open Xcode and navigate to `Window > Devices & Simulators`.
3. Select the correct device from the list and enable "Connect via Network".
4. You should see a network symbol next to the device in the list on the left.
5. Disconnect the iPhone from the USB port.

**Observed Behavior:**
- Android Studio detects the devices, but attempting to run an app results in an endless waiting loop without any visual indication of progress.
- If you reconnect the device via USB, the process continues as expected.
