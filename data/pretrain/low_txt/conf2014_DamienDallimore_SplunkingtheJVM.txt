## From Middle Earth
- **Make Splunk Apps & Add-ons**
- **JVM Background**

---

### What is the JVM?
**JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**
- First appeared in the early 1990s.
- Now the dominant runtime for enterprise applications.
- Commonly used in:
  - Application Servers
  - Enterprise Service Buses
  - Databases (including NoSQL)
  - Distributed Big Data Systems
  - Web Servers
  - Directory Servers
  - Search Engines
  - Build Systems
  - Gaming Platforms
  - Trading Systems
  - Reservation Systems
  - Core Banking
  - Messaging Infrastructure
  - Proprietary Systems

---

### Many JVM Variants
- Oracle Hotspot
- OpenJDK
- Oracle JRockit
- IBM J9
- Azul Zing

---

### JVMs Are Here to Stay
- It's not just about the "J" in Java.
- Big Data frameworks often run on the JVM.
- Gaining insights into your JVM data is crucial.

---

### Getting the Data
**Data Sources:**
- **Logs**
  - Standard Log Files
  - Developer Logs
- **JMX (Java Management Extensions)**
  - Instrumentation Agents
  - Operating System
  - Distributed Communications

---

### Log Data
**Standard Log Files:**
- Example:
  ```
  Oct 21, 2013 4:42:15 PM org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina load
  INFO: Initialization processed in 1153 ms
  Oct 21, 2013 4:42:15 PM org.apache.catalina.core.StandardService startInternal
  INFO: Starting service Catalina
  ```

- Application logs that are part of the product.
- Developer logs for any deployed code.
- Written to local disk or network storage.

---

### Garbage Collector Logs
- Example:
  ```
  54.736: [Full GC 54.737: [Tenured: 172798K->18092K(174784K), 2.3792658 secs] 257598K->18092K(259584K), [Perm : 20476K->20476K(20480K)], 2.4715398 secs] [Times: user=0.56 sys=0.05, real=0.07 secs]
  ```

- Generated by passing arguments to the JVM at startup:
  - `-verbose:gc`
  - `-Xloggc:/home/damien/jvm_logs/gc.log`
  - `-XX:+PrintGC`
  - `-XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps`
  - `-XX:+PrintGCDetails`

---

### Splunk Java Logging
- Sometimes, writing to a file or deploying a Universal Forwarder (UF) is not feasible.
- Appenders for Java Util Logging, Log4J, and Logback.
- Simply add a logging appender to your logging configuration file.

---

### LogBack Appender Example
- Code example provided in the presentation.

---

### Better Exception Logging
- Easier to work with in Splunk.

---

### Splunk SDK for Java
- Use the SDK from any JVM language (Java, Groovy, Scala, etc.).
- Send log events via REST, UDP, or TCP directly to Splunk from your code.
- Spring Integration Adaptors available on GitHub.
- SDK available from dev.splunk.com.

---

### JMX (Java Management Extensions)
- Monitor JVM via MBean attributes, operations, and notifications.
- Types of MBeans:
  - JVM MBeans
  - Vendor MBeans
  - Custom Coded MBeans

---

### Browsing MBeans with JConsole
- Visual tool for monitoring and managing MBeans.

---

### Getting This Data into Splunk
- Runs on all supported Splunk platforms.
- Works with all main JVM variants.
- 100% Free and Open Source.

---

### Simple Configuration
- Multiple `jmxserver` elements per configuration file.
- Multiple configuration files per Splunk instance.

---

### Scaling Horizontally
- Indexer Cluster
- UFs with JMX Mod Input
- Monitored JVMs

---

### Instrumentation Agents
- **SplunkJavaAgent**
  - Dynamic Byte Code Injection Agent for JVMs.
  - No need to change any code to get APM-level insights.
  - Startup argument: `-javaagent:splunkagent.jar`

---

### Raw Metrics You Can Get
- **Bytecode Injection:**
  - Class loading
  - Method execution
  - Method timings
  - Method call stack
  - Caught and uncaught exceptions
- **JMX:**
  - Running in local in-memory mode
- **Binary HPROF Memory Dumps:**
  - Decoded in text format
  - No more static hprof dumps and loading into another memory analysis tool

---

### Simple Configuration File
- Provided in the presentation.

---

### Raw Events Streamed into Splunk
- Use Splunk Search to deliver insights.

---

### Operating System
- The JVM executes as a process.
- External programs that provide additional JVM insights:
  - `top`
  - `jstat`
- Index this data in Splunk and correlate.

---

### Distributed Communications
- Valuable data flows in and out of JVMs.
- Messaging: Capture packets off the wire.

---

### Build a Splunk App!
- Reuse some of the data collection approaches in this presentation and build a specific JVM app.
- Publish it on apps.splunk.com.
- Benefits:
  - Make some money
  - Generate publicity for yourself/your company
  - Generate sales leads
  - Sell more Splunk licenses if you are also a partner
  - Do it because you love community collaboration
  - Become my beer buddy for life

---

### Some JVM App Ideas
- Splunk for JBoss
- Splunk for Tomcat
- Splunk for Solr
- Splunk for Cassandra
