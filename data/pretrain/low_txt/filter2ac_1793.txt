**Title: Can You Hear Me Now? Remote Eavesdropping Vulnerabilities in Mobile Messaging Applications**

On January 29, 2019, a critical vulnerability was discovered in Group FaceTime by multiple researchers. This flaw allowed an attacker to initiate a call and force it to connect without any interaction from the target, enabling the attacker to eavesdrop on the target's surroundings without their knowledge or consent. Although this significant bug was quickly addressed, it highlighted a previously unexplored attack surface in mobile applications that support video conferencing.

In this presentation, I will discuss my efforts to identify similar vulnerabilities in other popular messaging applications, including Signal, JioChat, Mocha, Google Duo, and Facebook Messenger. The goal is to raise awareness about the potential risks and to encourage more robust security measures in these widely used platforms.
