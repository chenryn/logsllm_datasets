### Realistic Attack Scenarios and False Positive Rates

Hopper achieves a false positive rate of 0.0012 in realistic attack scenarios. These results highlight the power of understanding the causal relationships in the movement paths that users make between internal enterprise machines. By identifying which logins belong to the same logical movement path and the user responsible for initiating each path, Hopper can detect a wide range of attacks while generating 8 times fewer false positives compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. Although common authentication logs make it challenging to infer precise causality, Hopper's use of specification-based anomaly detection—applying anomaly detection only in cases of high uncertainty—enables our approach to achieve good detection performance.
