- **Improved billing processes:** $189,000
- **Off-cycle meter reading:** $343,000
- **Truck roll reduction:** $680,000
- **Improved complaint management:** $79,000
- **Total:** $2,215,000

**Reduced Customer Outages and Proactive Transformer Replacement:**
In 2013, AMI technologies helped Pepco prevent over 6,000 customer outages. Pepco also uses AMI data for transformer load management, allowing for more proactive replacements under a planned outage strategy, reducing outage duration compared to emergency repairs.

**Customer Savings and Bill Credits:**
Through 2013, Pepco operated 4 curtailment events, reducing demand by 15 megawatts. Participating customers received a total of $1,671,931 in bill credit incentives. The web portal allows customers to view smart meter data and manage their energy usage.
