## Networks and Performance

Networks A and B use only the square activation function, which allows for a simpler Additively Homomorphic Encryption (AHE) based interactive protocol, thereby avoiding the use of Garbled Circuits (GC). Consequently, we only need to transmit short ciphertexts in the online phase. The use of AHE-based Fully Connected (FC) and Convolutional (Conv) layers, as opposed to multiplication triples, results in a 5-6× reduction in latency compared to [29] and [30] for Network A. The comparison with [18] is even more pronounced. The use of AHE with interaction acting as an implicit bootstrapping stage allows for aggressive parameter selection for the lattice-based scheme, resulting in over three orders of magnitude savings in both latency and network bandwidth.

Networks C and D use ReLU and MaxPool functions, which are implemented using GC. However, even for these networks, our efficient FC and Conv implementations allow for approximately 30× and 17× lower runtime when compared to [32] and [29], respectively. Additionally, unlike [32], our solution does not rely on a trusted third party.

## CIFAR-10 Dataset

The CIFAR-10 task is a commonly used image classification benchmark that is significantly more complex than the MNIST classification task. It involves classifying 32×32 color images with 3 color channels into 10 classes such as automobiles, birds, cats, etc. For this task, we replicate the network topology from [29] to ensure a fair comparison. We use a 10-bit wpt and an 8-bit wrelin.

The complexity of this network, measured by the number of multiplications, is 500× that of the MNIST network from [36] and [32]. By avoiding the need for multiplication triples, Gazelle offers a 50× faster offline phase and a 20× lower latency per inference, demonstrating that our results from smaller MNIST networks scale well to larger networks.

## Conclusions and Future Work

In conclusion, this work introduces Gazelle, a low-latency framework for secure neural network inference. Gazelle uses a judicious combination of packed additively homomorphic encryption (PAHE) and garbled circuit-based two-party computation (2PC) to achieve 20-30× lower latency and 2.5-88× lower online bandwidth compared to multiple recent 2PC-based state-of-the-art secure network inference solutions [29, 30, 32, 36], and more than three orders of magnitude lower latency and two orders of magnitude lower bandwidth than purely homomorphic approaches [18].

### Key Contributions
1. **Prime Moduli Selection**: Simultaneously allowing SIMD operations, low noise growth, and division-free and lazy modular reduction.
2. **Avoidance of Ciphertext-Ciphertext Multiplications**: Reducing noise growth.
3. **Secret-Sharing and Interaction**: Emulating a lightweight bootstrapping procedure to evaluate deep networks composed of many layers.
4. **Homomorphic Linear Algebra Kernels**: Efficient use of the automorphism structure enabled by a power-of-two slot-size.
5. **Sparing Use of Garbled Circuits**: Limited to ReLU and MaxPool functions with linear-size Boolean circuits.
6. **Compact Garbled Circuit-Based Transformation Gadget**: Securely composing the PAHE-based and garbled circuit-based layers.

### Future Directions
There are several natural avenues to build on our work, including handling neural networks with larger input sizes and developing a framework to automatically compile neural networks into secure inference protocols.
