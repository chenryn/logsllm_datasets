# Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecards

## Urban/Metropolitan Area A-59
**January 2007**

### Summary
- **Governance:** Established Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOP):** Established Implementation
- **Usage:** Established Implementation

### Overview
The Omaha Urban Area (UA) includes multiple jurisdictions, such as Sarpy, Douglas, and Washington counties. The UA has made significant progress in tactical interoperable communications, but there are areas for improvement.

### Key Findings
- **TICP Validation Exercise:**
  - The Incident Commander was not universally communicated to all exercise participants.
  - The Communications Unit Leader was not announced over the radio.
  
- **Interoperability Solutions:**
  - Shared channels and gateways are used regularly for drug task forces and mutual aid events.
  - During the TICP validation exercise, the UA demonstrated effective command and line-level communications across multiple local jurisdictions and disciplines.
  - Some technical and procedural issues were encountered, such as radio labeling and programming mismatches.
  - The exercise did not provide an opportunity to demonstrate interoperable communications with state and federal agencies.

### Recommendations
- **Update the TICP:**
  - Include After Action Report recommendations.
  - Address SOP issues, such as activation/deactivation of gateways, radio cache tracking procedures, and shared channel usage.

- **Formalize SOPs:**
  - Continue to establish and implement formal SOPs within the UA (outside of Douglas County) and distribute them appropriately.

- **Training and Exercises:**
  - Initiate basic and advanced training on SOPs, including communications unit implementation consistent with the TICP.
  - Ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance.
  - Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.

- **Technology:**
  - The Omaha UA has two 800 MHz trunked radio systems with 30 shared talk groups available for all public safety agencies.
  - There are five conventional interoperable talk groups shared between the two systems.
  - Multiple console patches and Raven fixed gateways are used for interoperability with UHF and VHF systems.
  - The Douglas County P25 system is likely to be expanded into Pottawattamie County, Iowa.
  - Sarpy County is planning to join the Douglas County P25 System or purchase its own communications system.
  - The Douglas County System is upgrading to Motorola's new 7.x technology for integrated voice and data communications.

## Urban/Metropolitan Area A-60
**January 2007**

### Summary
- **Governance:** Advanced Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOP):** Advanced Implementation
- **Usage:** Established Implementation

### Overview
The Las Vegas Urban Area (UA) includes the City of Las Vegas and jurisdictions within Clark County. The UA has a strong governance structure and well-developed SOPs for interoperable communications.

### Key Findings
- **Governance:**
  - The regional Communications Steering Committee has been in place for 20 years and has taken key steps toward communications interoperability.
  - The Committee supports the Urban Area Working Group on communications issues and oversaw the development of the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP).
  - The area has effectively included public support disciplines, state, and federal agencies in the governance process.
  - Budgets are developed based on regional strategic goals, using various funding sources, including grants.

- **SOPs:**
  - The Las Vegas UA has successfully developed and implemented local communications interoperability procedures prior to the TICP.
  - SOPs have been fully incorporated into the TICP, and further regionwide SOPs are being developed.
  - The TICP validation exercise demonstrated the successful use of all applicable communications interoperability SOPs.

- **Usage:**
  - The Las Vegas UA regularly uses three major shared systems to conduct multi-agency communications.
  - Despite regular use of interoperable solutions, some problems were encountered during the TICP validation exercise, such as the use of the command channel for tactical operations units and no gateway use demonstrated.

### Recommendations
- **Update the TICP:**
  - Include all available assets for interoperability, such as FBI and University of Nevada Las Vegas gateways.
  - Ensure that regional interoperability SOPs beyond the TICP are fully developed through a comprehensive interoperability plan.

- **Training and Exercises:**
  - Continue basic and advanced training on SOPs, including communications unit implementation consistent with the TICP.
  - Include gateways in future training and exercises to demonstrate proficiency.
  - Consider including additional state and federal agencies, such as the Department of Energy, in future exercises and day-to-day use.

- **Technology:**
  - The Las Vegas UA consists of three primary communication systems: the SNACC 800 MHz trunked system, the LVPD's METRO VHF system, and the statewide 800 MHz M/A-COM system.
  - The LVPD recently awarded a contract to M/A-COM to deploy a 700/800 MHz OpenSky communication system, which will allow for interoperability with state users.

## Urban/Metropolitan Area A-61
**January 2007**

### Summary
- **Governance:** Established Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOP):** Established Implementation
- **Usage:** Established Implementation

### Overview
The Jersey City/Newark Urban Area (UA) is a combination of two formerly separate UAs—Jersey City UA and Newark UA. The newly combined UA includes the cities of Newark and Jersey City, and the counties of Essex, Hudson, Bergen, Morris, Passaic, and Union.

### Key Findings
- **Governance:**
  - The Jersey City/Newark UA has a strong governance structure closely tied to the State of New Jersey.
  - Communications in the UA are governed by the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) Interoperability Subcommittee.
  - Formalized agreements exist across first responder agencies, and the UA has included agencies such as the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the New Jersey Department of Health, and the U.S. Coast Guard in the agreement process.
  - The state legislature mandated strategic interoperability planning three years ago, but no plan has been adopted yet.

- **SOPs:**
  - The TICP incorporated interoperability policies and procedures that had been in place for two and a half years.
  - Most agencies participated in the TICP process, and further steps have been taken to disseminate the regional SOPs.
  - The use of equipment SOPs was successfully demonstrated during the TICP validation exercise, though minor gaps in NIMS/ICS usage were noted.

- **Usage:**
  - The Jersey City/Newark UA uses shared UHF channels on a weekly basis and regularly deploys and uses radio caches and gateways.
  - The TICP validation exercise showed that users were proficient with the use of shared channels and gateways, though some minor training issues were encountered.

### Recommendations
- **Education and Awareness:**
  - Continue to be proactive in education efforts across stakeholders.
  - Encourage all participating agencies to fully adopt the strategic plan.
  - Develop a regional interoperability funding strategy, including long-term funding sources.

- **Training and Exercises:**
  - Continue awareness and understanding of policies and procedures across all agencies.
  - Initiate basic and advanced training on SOPs, including communications unit implementation consistent with the TICP.
  - Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.

- **Technology:**
  - The Jersey City Police Department operates a radio system with five UHF conventional channels.
  - The Jersey City Fire Department uses two UHF conventional channels.
  - The Newark Police Department uses a conventional UHF radio system, and the Newark Fire Department uses a VHF radio system.
  - All agencies can use the Essex County Sheriff’s Radio System (UHF/VHF) for interoperability.
  - All agencies also have access to the New Jersey Interoperability Communications System, which has eight 800 MHz channels and nine VHF channels.
  - Jersey City is implementing a UHF trunked radio system for police, fire, and EMS, with an estimated completion date at the end of 2007.
  - Newark is considering implementing an Essex County trunked system if funding issues can be resolved.
