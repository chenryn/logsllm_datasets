I'm planning a small, quick side project and am considering using the Google App Engine, which supports Python and has Django built in. This would be a great opportunity for me to try out this platform. However, I have a few questions:

1. Has anyone used the Google App Engine for more than just toy projects? I've seen some good example applications, so I assume it's suitable for real-world use, but I'd appreciate any feedback on this.
2. Are there any other success stories or failure points that I should be aware of?

The original question has been well-answered, but I'd like to add one more point: The Google App Engine offers a plugin for the Eclipse IDE, which is very user-friendly. If you already use Eclipse for development, you'll find this particularly convenient. Deploying your application to the Google App Engine is as simple as clicking a button with an airplane logoâ€”very straightforward and efficient.
