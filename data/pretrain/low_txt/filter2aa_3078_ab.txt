### Compulsory OSS Project: Protocol Library
- Emulate ActiveSync Protocol
- Allow for projects to interact with mobile clients in new ways
- Translation layer between Exchange clients and other servers
- Lots of things!

### Lofty Goal: Data Theft

- Hopefully possible!

### Lofty Goal: Ongoing Access
- What sort of configuration options can we set?
- Anything undocumented?
- Can we reconfigure the device to point at another server?
