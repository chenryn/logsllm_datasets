## Abstract
The title "Hey, You, Get Off of My Market" highlights the critical issue of detecting malicious applications in both official and alternative Android markets. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to identify and mitigate such threats, ensuring the security and integrity of the Android ecosystem.

## Introduction
### Motivation
- **Smartphones**: The rapid growth of smartphone usage, particularly in the Android market, has led to an increase in the number of malicious apps.
  - **Market Share (Q2 2010 to Q2 2011)**:
    - iOS: 202%
    - Android: 442% (44.7%)
    - Symbian: 8.7%

- **Apps Growth**:
  - The number of apps in the official Android market has grown significantly over time.
  - **App Count (Q3 2009 to Q3 2011)**:
    - Q3 2009: 525
    - Q4 2009: 400
    - Q1 2010: 298
    - Q2 2010: 202
    - Q3 2010: 130
    - Q4 2010: 76
    - Q1 2011: 6
    - Q2 2011: 16
    - Q3 2011: 36

- **Markets**:
  - The proliferation of alternative Android markets has introduced additional security challenges.
  - **Malware in Markets**:
    - The overall health of Android markets is a significant concern due to the increasing presence of malware.

## Design Goals
- **Accuracy**:
  - Detect malware with low false positives and negatives.
- **Scalability**:
  - Scale to handle hundreds of thousands of apps.
- **Efficiency**:
  - Process all apps within a reasonable amount of time.

## DroidRanger Overview
DroidRanger is a system designed to detect malicious apps in both official and alternative Android markets. It consists of the following components:

- **Representative Android Markets**:
  - App Repository
  - Malware Samples
  - Permission-based Behavioral Footprints
  - Footprint-based Detection Engine
  - Infection from Known Malware
  - Heuristics-based Detection Engine
  - Infection from Zero-day Malware
  - Heuristics

## Footprint-based Detection Engine
- **Filtering**:
  - Filters apps based on essential permissions.
  - **Example Permissions**:
    - Geinimi: INTERNET, SEND_SMS
    - ADRD: INTERNET, ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE
    - Pjapps: RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED
    - Bgserv: INTERNET, RECEIVE_SMS
    - jSMSHider: INSTALL_PACKAGES
    - Zsone: RECEIVE_SMS, SEND_SMS
    - DroidDreamLight: INTERNET, READ_PHONE_STATE
    - BaseBridge: NATIVE CODE

- **Matching**:
  - Matches apps to known malware behavioral footprints across multiple dimensions.
  - **Information in Manifest File**:
    - Declares a receiver listening to SMS_RECEIVED.
  - **Semanics in Byte-code**:
    - Registers a receiver listening to SMS_RECEIVED.
    - Calls abortBroadcast in the receiver.
    - Sends SMS messages to premium numbers.
  - **Structural Layout**:
    - Example: Behavioral footprint of Zsone.

## Heuristics-based Detection Engine
- **Selection**:
  - Selects apps with dynamic Java/native code loading.
- **Monitoring**:
  - Monitors runtime behavior.
  - **Java Code**:
    - Permission-related framework APIs.
  - **Native Code**:
    - System calls requiring root privileges.

## Evaluation
### Overall
- **Data Set**:
  - Crawled the official and four alternative markets.
  - Collected 204,040 free apps during May-June 2011.
- **Processing Time**:
  - Processed all 204,040 apps in four and a half hours.
- **Results**:
  - **Official Market**: 153,002 apps
  - **eoeMarket**: 17,229 apps
  - **alcatelclub**: 14,943 apps
  - **gfan**: 10,385 apps
  - **mmoovv**: 8,481 apps

### Malware Detection
- **Known Malware**:
  - **Official Market**: 21 (0.02%)
  - **eoeMarket**: 9 (0.35%)
  - **alcatelclub**: 48 (0.39%)
  - **gfan**: 20 (0.20%)
  - **mmoovv**: 21 (0.47%)

- **Zero-day Malware**:
  - **Total Infected Apps Detected by DroidRanger**: 171 (40 known, 211 total)

### Footprint-based Detection Engine
