### Protection Against Keystroke Inference Attacks

#### 1. Real-Time Typing Activity Detection (rTAD)

rTAD is designed to initiate countermeasures against keystroke inference attacks as soon as typing activity is detected. The primary goal of rTAD is to maximize recall, ensuring that typing activity is identified promptly, while minimizing false positives to avoid impacting the functionality of other non-malicious applications on the smartwatch.

We evaluated rTAD in two different settings, as visually explained in Figure 9:

- **N=1**: Typing activity is recognized when a 10-second window is classified as a typing window. This allows countermeasures to be initiated within 10 seconds of the user starting to type.
- **N=2**: Typing activity is recognized when two or more 10-second windows are classified as typing windows within a minute. Countermeasures can be initiated no sooner than 20 seconds after the user starts typing.

#### 2. Protection Mechanisms

Once rTAD identifies that the user is typing, countermeasures against keystroke inference attacks can be activated automatically and non-intrusively. These measures are only activated when the user is actively typing, thus preserving the utility of motion sensors for other applications, such as games that use motion data.

The protection mechanism can be implemented either by the Motion Sensor Access Controller (MSAC) in the operating system or as a trusted middleware. For this framework to function, we assume that all third-party applications access motion sensor data through the MSAC, which has the ability to modify or restrict the flow of this data. While this assumption requires changes to the operating system architecture, it should be a straightforward task for developers. Importantly, existing third-party applications do not need to be modified, as long as the APIs for accessing motion sensors remain unchanged.

Some strategies that the MSAC can adopt when rTAD reports typing activity include:

- **Complete Blocking**: This strategy completely blocks the side-channel but may also affect the utility of other non-malicious applications that rely on motion data.
- **Reduced Sampling Rate**: To preserve some utility, the MSAC can provide third-party applications with access to motion sensors at a reduced sampling rate. This reduces the efficiency of side-channel attacks.
- **Random Out-of-Order Blocks**: A smarter MSAC can send out-of-order blocks of sensor readings to third-party applications. This can significantly reduce the accuracy of side-channel attacks while still maintaining some utility for certain non-malicious applications, such as daily calorie counters.

Users can choose among these MSAC protection strategies based on their personal preferences and lifestyles.

#### 3. Evaluation

We implemented and evaluated rTAD to ensure the effectiveness of the entire protection mechanism. The evaluation used the same smartwatch setup detailed in Section 4.3, involving four participants with varied lifestyles who wore the watch for extended periods.

- If rTAD does not recognize typing activity, it prompts the participant every 15 minutes to collect ground truth.
- If rTAD recognizes typing activity, it immediately prompts the user for ground truth. However, if the user continues to type for a long period, rTAD does not ask for ground truth for 15 minutes after the initial detection to avoid annoyance and ensure balanced ground truth collection.

In real usage, the user will not be prompted for ground truth; instead, the MSAC will automatically activate as soon as rTAD reports typing activity.

Figure 10 shows the normalized true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) values, along with precision and recall.

During the evaluation, we encountered an issue where the Magnetic Field Change feature behaved unexpectedly, particularly when participants typed on a laptop. This was due to the magnet inside the laptop's hard drive. Since desktop keyboards are generally placed away from hard drives, the feature performed as expected in that case. For the remainder of the evaluation, we excluded the Magnetic Field Change feature to avoid confusion between laptop and desktop typing. However, as laptops with non-magnetic solid-state drives become more common, this feature may become useful in the future.

The combined TP, TN, FP, and FN results from the four participants are shown in Figure 10, normalized with respect to the total number of ground truths collected in each setting. In the N=1 setting, we observed lower FN and higher TP, but at the cost of higher FP. In the N=2 setting, we observed lower FP but at the cost of lower TP and higher FN. This indicates that rTAD can gain recall by trading off precision, and vice versa. Overall, rTAD achieved high recall values, confirming its effectiveness in the protection framework.

#### 4. Discussions

- **Left or Right Hand**: Our attack framework requires a differently trained model for users wearing the watch on their right hand. However, rTAD is designed to work independently of which hand the smartwatch is worn on, making it ready to use without manual setup.
- **Usability**: The protection framework focuses on usability, with a low processor-intensive design that consumes minimal battery power. It minimizes false positives and operates non-intrusively, ensuring a simple and efficient setup process in real-life implementations.

### Conclusion

This paper presents a novel keystroke inference attack that utilizes wrist-motion data from a smartwatch as side-channel information. We designed and validated a learning-based attack framework to recover text typed by a smartwatch-wearing user on an external QWERTY keyboard. By demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed classification and prediction mechanisms, we validate our hypothesis that wearable devices can leak sensitive personal information if sensor access is not properly regulated. We also present a smart protection framework to automatically regulate sensor access, enhancing privacy without degrading the device's utility.
